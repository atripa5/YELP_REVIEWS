They use quality ingredients, thoughtfully prepared, well balanced and well presented without being fussy. The menu is creative without being silly and healthy without being austere.  

You won&#39;t bite into rubber gristly factory chicken here. That in itself is getting more and more rare in LA for reasonably priced food so it&#39;s worth pointing out. And there&#39;s a good use of vegetables, which is also rare. I feel great after eating this food - energized, clear headed, full without feeling stuffed. So basic but so hard to find in a restaurant experience!

With so many LA restaurants having nearly identical boring menus that are very unfriendly and sometimes downright hostile to people that need to eat gluten free, it&#39;s refreshing to come to a place that has a lot of low or no gluten options perhaps without even intending to, just because the international cuisines they draw from for inspiration (with Asia a big influence) don&#39;t revolve around gluten (like Italian or French or American cuisines do).  

The design and atmosphere is great too, but I usually order from ubereats just to save time when I&#39;m at work. Even with their to go orders they considered design and use paperboard bowls that are actually pleasant and not annoying to eat out of. They&#39;re also open all day which is an extra plus, and I&#39;ve been known to order from here more than once in a day."

I ordered the chicken and waffles and was highly disappointed. Usually I scarf those papas down but I couldn&#39;t finish it. The waffles were okay but the syrup is awful! I also had to ask for a side of it since it only came slightly drizzled. The chicken was a basic garlic lemon flavor. 

Coffee-wise: Also disappointed with the macchiato as it came in a very tiny glass. I know brunch places are bougie but it was so small! It tasted very bitter even with the side of syrup I asked for. My friend asked for regular coffee and they came back and told us they ran out... What?? 

My friend and I were going to grab dessert somewhere after but the food left us feeling like we lost our appetite. This food crushed our soul. Seeing all the good reviews, maybe many people like it after all, but it&#39;s kind of suspect that a lot of the reviewers are Yelp Elite."

A friend and I shared the Pretzel Grilled Cheese and the Garlic Pork Hash. We both agreed that the grilled cheese was delicious (especially because of the soft pretzel bread), but it was waaaaaaaaayyy too greasy :s definitely a guilty pleasure. The Garlic Pork Hash on the other hand was perfect--the bowl comes with pork hash, fried poached egg, some pancake pattie thingy, and the pork hash. I personally hate dried fruit, and there were a lot of dried cranberries in the hash x_x 

The service here was great! The owner (a lady with green hair) was superduper friendly and asked us for feedback and inspiration for upcoming new dishes. I had a great experience dining here and would definitely come back.

Truly, I wanted to try everything on the menu, from the small brunch one to the regular one to the drinks. The space is bright and airy, and coming on a Sunday early afternoon, there was plenty of seating. I parked in the lot of the plaza for free, but it may not have been. The parking attendant did give us a suspicious eye when we left, but there were no signs for anything, so I figured it was OK! The 3-star review rationale is at the very bottom...

1. Fried cucumber: This was good, but I felt overfried and the portions are TINY. The dipping sauce was good.

2. BOLina: This is their Mexican version of the bowl, or rather the Chilaquiles version. With a fried egg on top and crunchy tortilla underneath, this was very very good. I ordered pork belly as my meat of choice and this did not disappoint. 

3. Chicken and waffles: Always and attractive option, this was done pretty well. On par with the best of them. 

I think the reason I gave the 3 stars is the service. We had ordered two of their awesome sounding drinks as well as an Americano. We reminded our server halfway through, when we were almost done with our food which came out fairly quickly. The server stared at us blankly then continued serving other guests. At the end of our meal, he began collecting our plates and silverware and we brought up the drinks again. Again, blank response. So we asked for the bill and said it was fine. He came back with the bill but without a word of apology or anything!! It was as if he just didn&#39;t understand us. It was one of the strangest encounters at a restaurant I&#39;ve ever experienced. I think the correct thing would have been to apologize and say that the drinks will be coming, or that he can take it off our bill. The lack of response was so strange!"

Not only is the food awesome, but the restaurant decor is really cool!  The owner/chef/designer picked it out herself.  I had saw a photo of her in one of the Yelp reviews and when we saw her, we got excited.  Our waitress confirmed that this was the owner and that she&#39;d probably be by to say hi since it was our first time there.

I had my eye on the pretzel grilled cheese so we ordered the wedges as an appetizer.  The owner did come by to say hi and to bring us these delicious rice fritters which were sweet and crunchy and just very yummy.  She talked about growing up and cooking for her family and how she liked to serve everything in bowls so that you can share and eat family style.

The pretzel bread and ooey gooey cheese was amazing.  I was getting full already, but luckily I ordered one of the lighter bols, the balsamic fig with a poached egg.  One friend got the BOLicious and the other got the got the Miso Peanut Ramen.  Since sharing is caring, we all got to sample each others.  I will say that I liked mine the best - the peanut sauce was a bit too peanutty for me, but the noodles and shrimp were yummy.  The BOLicious was also good but reminiscent of the fritters.  

Still everything was more than ediBOL!  The owner also brought by these lemon ricotta fritters which were little balls of heaven!  Warm, crispy and sweet.

Love this place and want to come back and sit outside when it&#39;s not so hot!!  Need to try the fried pickles, the spiced grilled edamame, the chicken wings, among other things.  My eyes are way bigger than my stomach!  NOM NOM!!"

The food was different but not special. Got a couple of things from the weekend brunch menu. Place is hidden in the plaza, below the big modern residential buildings. 
The pork herb hash had an interesting combination , like the crispy poached egg but it had soooo may raisins where it overpowered all the other flavors and made it sweet. Not my fav. 
Baked eggs with tomato, onions &amp; chorizo,  not amazing. So simple, could easily be made at home as it was nothing creative, hardly had much chorizo, it was more tomato &amp; onions. 

Portions here are small, and tends to be pricey for what you are getting. 

Lemonades both citrus &amp; lemon were filled with ice to the top for $5 each and didn&#39;t taste freshly made. Maybe I should&#39;ve added some alcohol to it. 

Plenty of indoor and outdoor seating, wasnt busy on a Sun morning. The decor is simple and the place is bright.

The ambience is clean and hipster, fitting right in with downtown LA. 

They were busy, but it took a while for someone to help us, despite standing right next to an empty table. We ordered the pork hash, which is on their weekend brunch menu, and the bolicious with chicken. I really enjoyed the hash, which had almonds, sweet potatoes and golden raisins. The raisins and potatoes added a sweetness to the dish. Their take on a biscuit was creative and I liked their crispy poached egg. Their bolicious had a spicy kick to the heirloom rice and the flavors were great. 

Overall, if you&#39;re looking for something healthy and not too heavy, try this spot out."

I had the BOLicious with some shrimp and let me tell you, all the ingredients that make up this BOL was like Los Angeles! You know, diverse, different flavors, different textures.. tart, sour, salty, savory, YUM YUM YUM! You definitely taste the rainbow and presentation was excellent, my bowl was like a rainbow.. Greens, Yellows, reds, small pieces, big pieces.. The little poached egg was a nice touch of protien because adding more protien or toppings can cost you a little extra, the shrimp was an extra $5 but it was worth it!

My girlfriends and I came here for dinner and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves! Our server highly recommended the BOLicious - so we all ended up ordering it with different types of proteins. We also got rice fritters and the fried pickle chips, as well as a bottle of Riesling! Wooohoo! We take Girls&#39; Night Out VERY SERIOUSLY. 

[Entrees]
The BOLicious is seriously as delicious as everyone says. The umami fried heirloom rice is a thicker, denser grain that is slightly sweetened and paired really well with all the marinated/pickled veggies on top. I LOVED the crispy poached egg. It was a poached egg that was slightly fried on the outside so you get this interesting combination of crunchy, and soft, and that heavenly amount of yolk leaking out! I added pork belly onto my bowl, and was happy that they were very generous with the pork and the fatty belly, and even more happy that the meat was wonderfully marinated. Super tasty and filling bowl - and healthy too! What a plus! 

[Appetizers]
The Fried Pickle Chips were a refreshing addition to the meal. Sweet+sour pickles were lightly fried and came with a neutralizing herbed cream sauce. Super easy and fun to munch on!

The Rice Fritters were just alright to me - mainly because they tasted like the umami rice (in the BOLicious) but compacted and then fried. It was marketed as having a lemon glaze to it, but I couldn&#39;t really taste the sour tang to it. It was just an okay dish to me, and I wouldn&#39;t order it again because it IS very dense/filling and not worth the filling:taste ratio!

[Price]
We were really happy with how affordable everything was. For 4 entrees + 2 appetizers + bottle of wine + tax + 18% tip, it was around $26/per person. 

[Parking]
FREE PARKING!! There&#39;s a lot right in front of &#34;Grow the Produce Shop&#34; - park here and get it validated and you&#39;re good to go! Actually, when we left there wasn&#39;t even a parking attendant to take our validated ticket - so it&#39;s a pretty chill lot. There&#39;s also a good amount of street parking around!

[Overall]
HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Super tasty, affordable, filling, and healthy! If you&#39;re in the Arts District area, you MUST DROP BY!!"

First things first, parking is validated for 2hrs in the parking lot right next to it. There was also no wait when I came with a friend on Saturday around noon, so that was a nice surprise, especially after being used to waiting obscene amounts of time for overhyped LA brunch spots.

Now onto the actual food - We split the BOLicious with pork belly and the French toast. I thought the portions were fair, and we were able to mostly finish both things, but I was stuffed at the end. The BOLicious has a nice mix of flavors and textures, and it&#39;s well done. I can be particular about mixing different textures, but this was good! The crispy poached egg was unique, and I thought this was a creative take on something resembling bibimbap. Recommend the pork belly as the protein choice. Overall, it hit the spot for something savory.

I have a huge sweet tooth, so of course we had to balance the savory dish with something sweet. The French toast is glazed in brown sugar, and the actual brioche is really custard-y. The accompanying bacon was a perfect match for the syrup. I loved it! Definitely too rich and dense for one person, but good for splitting! 

Nothing to complain about in terms of service, though we were there while it wasn&#39;t that busy. I&#39;d come back if I were in the area but probably wouldn&#39;t go specifically for ediBOL. It&#39;s a solid addition to the brunch scene but not extremely special."

Chicken Wings - They fall off the bone! Juicy and the sauce is slap your mama GOOD!

BOLicious - Super fresh tasting. Loved it! Add the fried egg.

Honey Citrus Bol - An awesome recommendation by our waiter and my new favorite! 

Lemon Ricotta Fritters - An item I would have never ordered. Andrea, the owner, surprised us with them for my sisters birthday and they were DE-LI-CIOUS! It reminds me of the Nigerian puff puff dish, but with lemon.

Pretzel Grilled Cheese Sandwich with Chicken - This is a MUST! Did you hear me? A MUST Omg! Ultimate winner right here. The flavors of this sandwich are so darn good. This is my absolute favorite sandwich in the world, yes the world.

SERVICE: efficient and friendly. Very gracious host.

AMBIENCE: cute store with high ceilings and clean tables. Relatively quiet so you can have a good conversation. My friend and I were able to catch up. 

FOOD: we got the seasonaBOL ($6) which was a lemonade with blackberry and mint. Super refreshing and delicious. For an appetizer my friend and I split the pretzel grilled cheese which was gooey and moist and delicious and everything grilled cheese ($8) should be. For entrees we got the honey citrus bowl which is a cold bowl with rice/quinoa, fresh greens, oranges, candied pecans, edemame, peppers, pickled radishes, and caramelized onions. My friend added the shrimp to hers (the way to do it, so good) and I got the chicken. Both were good but I&#39;d recommend the shrimp over the chicken.

I don&#39;t eat meat and they have lots of vegetarian options, rather you just don&#39;t add meat. The one veggie bowl has pesto which I&#39;m allergic to so that was a no (I know so terrible) but not their fault.

So I settled with the BOLina. In my mind I was imagining something like a Chipotle Bowl without rice and of higher quality of course. The ingredients were layered between two corn &#39;tortillas&#39; but more like tostadas. The pineapple salsa was yummy but there was so much it almost made it like soup. Not sure if it was on purpose or not.

They are seasonally inspired colorful food combinations in a bowl, that come hot or cold, or even as a drink, &#34;Refreshabol&#39;s&#34;. 

I had brunch on a Sunday afternoon with a group of 16 Yelpers. We had called ahead to made reservations so I was happy to see that a nice big table was reserved for us when we arrived. They sat us immediately, even though our whole party wasn&#39;t there yet. I really appreciated that they didn&#39;t make us wait until everyone got there. We were seated on the patio which I preferred. I would definitely suggest sitting outside if possible. 

I ordered a Pretzel Grilled Cheese which it had Sharp cheddar, muenster cheese, caramelized onion, citrus slaw, and stone ground mustard on a butter griddled pretzel baguette. You can add bacon for $3.00. I loved it! The pretzel was doughy and the cheeses melted on it like a grilled cheese sandwich. The citrus slaw added a final touch giving it the unique flavor. 

I also shared the Chicken and Waffles with my friend. It&#39;s served with honey lemon crispy chicken, housmade waffle, spiced caramelized pecans, and apricot ginger syrup. The chicken was crispy and juicy, while the waffle were cooked to perfection, not too soft or hard, it was just right. 

On my second visit I ordered the rice fritters and fried pickles. The rice fritters were made with Koda farms Japanese hairloom grain rice. They steam it in Tamari, sake, lemon, ginger, and garlic. They were AMAZING!


Some of the other items that were ordered at the table were:

-French Toast Custard with Pure maple syrup, and bacon. Yum, I had a bite! 

-Roasted Garlic and Herb Pork Hash with a biscuit which had a crispy poached egg, tomatillo crema, pickled golden raisins, and candied almonds. Served with their house baked cheddar buttermilk biscuit. 

-Honey Citrus was roasted cauliflower, quinoa, green lentil pilaf, market veggies, spiced caramelized pecans, and honey maple citrus dressing. 

-BOLicious was Umami fried heirloom rice, crispy poached egg, greens, pickled tomatoes, kohlrabi wedges, cucumber scallion relish, and homemade togarash

-Cheddar buttermilk biscuit sandwich with    soft scrambled eggs. (I tried this on my second visit) DELICIOUS! 

-Fried pickles (I tried this on my second visit) SO GOOD! 

At the end of our meal Chef Andrea came out to see how our experience was. I thought she was so sweet. She brought out complimentary lemon ricotta fritters for the table. They tasted like a warm donut! They were hot, crispy with power sugar on them. Too bad I had to share with the table!

I was really confused at the concept and what they were trying to do. I can&#39;t say that they describe themselves perfectly but the food was actually pretty tasty! 

Parking is good, as long as you get validation it is free. 

The restaurant is SUPER hipster and not all too big. The owner herself came and talked to me about the menu which I really appreciated. It was nice to hear her story about what ediBOL was and what type of food they were trying to serve. 

I had the Ginger Sesame $9 (sweet pepper, scallion, shiitake, red cabbage, greens, candied almond, ginger sesame dressing topped with crispy togarashi rice sticks. I also added a Pork Belly Topping for $5. 

I thought it was especially delicious. The flavor combinations were really different than I had tried before. A little bit of it was messy... like i said the food was good but I really wasn&#39;t sure what I was eating. I felt like they just threw a ton of ingredients in together and made it look presentable... but in the end it was still like a salad.  For the price... I wouldnt really come back to eat a salad for $15+ ... 

I&#39;d say its a good place to try once! or twice! But thats about it."

It&#39;s not a fast-casual bowl place, but a sitdown that happens to have bowls, sandwiches, and other options. The menu contains a variety of dishes that don&#39;t come standard with meat (you&#39;ll have to add it as an topping). I opted for the bolicious and added a topping of pork belly ($5). The food was very tasty - asian inspired, fresh, and healthy and despite my fear of inadequate portion size, I did get reasonably full. 

They&#39;ve got plenty of seating both inside and outside in the One Santa Fe paseo. Overall, a nice asian bowl option in the Arts District."

It&#39;s a cute little restaurant with simple furniture which makes the place feel kind of homey. The white curtains creates a classy and carefree ambience which I appreciated. People walking through the doors on a Wednesday morning seemed so chill. No job to rush off to. Only breakfast to worry about ( probably not the case)

My friends and I decided to try this place out. So many of the ingredients on the menu sounded foreign to me. If you check out my yelp the only place I&#39;ve been to that I think is remotely close to the type of food they sell here at ediBol is Lemonade. 

My friends and I ordered 4 dishes. 

1. The Bol with seared shrimp. Probably my favorite of all. It was a smorgasbord of things in a bowl. Shrimp was nice and fat. They definitely don&#39;t skimp out on their portions. $9 

2. Custard french toast. This was my dish because I love french roast, but I didn&#39;t expect it to be so sweet. It was like the sister to bread pudding. So delicious but too sweet for the mornings. I couldn&#39;t finish it and it gave me such a sugar rush before the mid afternoon crash. Had 2 strip of oily bacon on top. $11

3. Pork hash. Delicious bread. Buttery. Too much for breakfast or the first meal of the day. $14

4. Roasted cauliflower. This appetizer was pretty good. Was more on the sour side than I liked it to be, but it was tolerable. My friend said that the cauliflower PH level was definitely a 3 lol (nursing humor)

Overall the experience, service, and the taste of the food was good. Very savory and rich."

We were greeted right away upon arrival and seated in minutes. Love that especially during  Sunday lunch time.  We were also approached by the owner and she welcomed us with a smile and explained her menu after she found out it was our first time there.  

So we ended up going with what she recommended-

BOLicious with pork belly- comes with their infamous crispy poached eggs (so so good!!!) sautéed greens and veges, umami fried heirloom rice, and homemade togarashi to give it that kick.  And topping it with pork belly! I mean come on now... get this or else you ll be sorry you didn&#39;t.  I loved all the flavor infused and it went merrily well on my palate.

Roasted Garlic and herbed pork hash was made with tomatillo crema and accompanied with their crispy poached eggs.  Their homemade biscuit was optional and believe me, smelling it from their kitchen made it easy for us to add it! Again, flavors were bold and defined.   I liked it alot.  If you like savory and yet feels amazingly light, this is definitely a must try as well.  And those biscuits were bomb!!! Soft and buttery!

For dranks, we went with two glasses of cabernet sauvignon to wash it all down only to crave some more after each bite.

We were very satisfied and very pleased.  I would definitely return.  Can&#39;t wait to taste the rest of her menu items!

Parking is located just a few steps away.

The ingredients feel exotic and fresh, so it&#39;s got a certain style to the place.

Parking is easy in that there&#39;s a parking lot with 2 hr free parking with validation and the surrounding area is a bit sketchy, but this immediate area feels like a safe sanctuary and the complex itself is like a mini city or compound with a market, bookstore and other retailers.  I get a sense there&#39;s a bit of architectural and economic gentrification going on here, which will revitalize what used to be a ghetto area and turn into into a hipster&#39;s paradise."

I had the pork hash or sth like that, the pork was immersed in something sour like lemon, that&#39;s not how you treat pork! My friend had a waffle chicken, the waffle was over cooked and didn&#39;t taste good, and even the syrup was weird and didn&#39;t suit the dish.

This place really impressed us on the first visit, but it was at the end of the first visit that raised my eyebrow.  Before I delve into that issue, I&#39;d like to say how welcoming this place is.  Fairly new to the downtown area, this place is apart of new construction and really adds to the urban appeal.  A small, but quaint, and relaxing atmosphere with a bar in the middle of the restaurant, the cooks visible in the kitchen area, and a flat screen tv hanging high for all to see.  One main, and impressive, point is the cleanliness in this place.  Anyway, so much for highlights, I&#39;d like to dwell on the overall experience at this restaurant.

As mentioned earlier, my eyebrow was raised at the end of our first visit to this restaurant.  Reason being, after we commended the owner on how good the food is, she came and told us she&#39;d like for us to try one of her desserts.  She asked if we had a few minutes, so we obliged, and stayed to try the dessert.  Well, the dessert was a warm golden oat bar with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  The presentation was nice, and the dessert itself was good.  Much to our surprise, we were charged for the small delight, that wasn&#39;t cheap.  Usually, when someone voluntarily asks you to try something, it&#39;s free.  Anyway, on that same visit, we tried the BOLicious hot bowl ($9) with lemon ginger chicken, for an additional $3.50.  This normal serving is quite good, but overly priced.  Also, we tried the French Toast Custard ($11), which is french toast marinated in vanilla custard, with applewood smoked bacon, and brown butter syrup.  This was good, as well.  Trying to be nice, we decided to pay a second visit.  On the second visit, the food was overly salty, and the new staff was rather careless, one server bringing the food to our table with his thumb visibly in the bowl close to the food.  I addressed these concerns to the owner.  She apologized to me via Instagram, and thanked me for sharing my thoughts to help them improve.  Furthermore, she stated &#34;can&#39;t wait to see you again&#34;...&#34;will cook some extra treats for you&#34;.  Well, that statement alone insinuates that there will be a complimentary treat of some sort on the next visit.  On our third visit, the food wasn&#39;t salty and the owner came to the table to speak.  Well, that&#39;s all she did, as there were no &#34;extra treats&#34;, as she indicated in her message on Instagram.  So, it seems like this owner is all about getting return visits, despite any disservice or aggravation a customer may endure in her restaurant.  Misleading tactics are never good for any business owner.  

All in all, some of the food was good during our dining experience at this restaurant.  Given the prices, misleading tactics from the owner, and our overall dining experience, there&#39;s no need for a return visit.  Undoubtedly, the owner has good intentions, and I wish her well, but misleading customers and not making good on your mishaps is never a good rule of thumb in business."

The restaurant is located on a corner so you can&#39;t really miss it. Apparently there is a parking structure you can park at, or you can try to street park like I did. Watch out for signs though! 

Went with the DineLA menu for $29, starting with the drink, I got the PleasuraBOL, fried pickle chips, pretzel grilled cheese wedges BOLicious with Pork Belly and the Lemon Ricotta Fritters.

PleasureaBOL: Really great starting drink, tastes almost like a hard strawberry lemonade. I couldn&#39;t taste the alcohol at first, but then I felt the glow from drinking it too fast. 

Appetizers (more like samplers), Fried Pickle Chips and Pretzel Grilled Cheese Wedges: Got a few tiny fried pickle chips with an aioli sauce which you just drench over the chip, pretty good and a piece of the pretzel grilled cheese wedge. You can see the cheese oozing out and falling off as you are eating it. The pretzel bread gives it a nice texture. If you order the full appetizer, it comes with 4 pretty sizable pieces. 

BOLicious: A rice dish with a lot going on, there&#39;s cold veggies, hot veggies, the amazingly cooked pork belly and best of all, the fried poach egg. The portion looks pretty small and heavy, but it&#39;s really filling and I ended up finishing it all!

Lemon Ricotta Fritters: Comes out freshly made, super soft but the lemon taste is pretty masked. We ended up bringing them next door to pair with the ice cream. 

Overall the vibe is pretty casual and nice, a great lunch spot for sure. Service is a bit spotty but not unbearable. Will be back to try their other dishes!"

Nothing really stood out &amp; the portions were pretty small.

We ordered the sausage hash, pretzel grilled cheese wedges, baked eggs &amp; lemon ricotta fritters.

The sausage hash was good but definitely tasted like thanksgiving stuffing.

Pretzel grilled cheese wedges were meh. I think it would have been a more successful dish if they weren&#39;t so messy, added some ham, were not presented in a bowl &amp; they did not add the whole grain mustard.  

Baked eggs were good but on the small side. Good but nothing amazing. 

Lemon ricotta fritters were pleasant but I wish they were more doughy &amp; a bit larger.

All in all the meal was ok but I probably would not go back.
 There are betters places to eat nearby.

Protip: parking is a nightmare here.  The lot holds about 40 cars &amp; there are at least 10 businesses here which is ridiculous.

Visited this place months ago with a group of friends who have Yelp accounts. Some call it a UYE or PYE (unofficial Yelp event or Private Yelp event). What&#39;s good about trying places with other Yelpers is that everyone knows we take pictures of the food before eating it, so you better not touch it until we&#39;re done!

They do serve all three meals of breakfast, lunch and dinner but this review is primarily for brunch. A group of 16+ Yelpers and myself came out for a Sunday Bruch to try this relatively new place out. We had a special guest, Nadine C. who was visiting us from Honolulu. I also came on another occasion to have Brunch here with just 2 folks.  

The restaurant is both indoors and outdoor seating. We called ahead of time to be able to seat 16 of us outside and accommodate us. The owner, Andrea, is very friendly and warm. She came out to introduce herself making sure we were okay. She even gave us complementary lemon ricotta fritters as dessert. The weekend brunch menu is composed of Bols (bowls) both hot, cold of unique concoction along with sandwiches and refreshing drinks.

I tried the Bolicious which is umami fried rice, crispy poached egg, seared greens, pickled tomatoes, kohlrabi wedges, cucumber scallion relish, and homemade togarashi. With Bol&#39;s you can get added bowl toppings such as garlic herb beef, lemon ginger chicken, garlic shrimp, or pork belly for extra charge. I had mine with pork belly and complemented well with the refreshing components of Bolicious. Very good brunch item.

On another occasion, I also had the roasted garlic and herb pork hash that came with a crispy poached egg and tomatillo cream. I added a cheddar buttermilk biscuit which is a must. It adds a carb element to the dish which is necessary for the pork hash. Pretty good dish as well. 

They also have Refreshabol&#39;s as part of their drink menu. I tried the lemon ginger infused drink with fresh thyme and lemongrass. Very good drink and very refreshing. Not too sweet either.

The service here was slow on both occasions. The first time with 16 Yelpers was understandable but the other occasion with 2 of us wasn&#39;t. Though this place is fairly new, it seems like the waiters lack experience with customers. They did their best with 16 folks but didn&#39;t write things down and were forgetful with request for utensils, water, correct orders.
The second time I came where there were 2 of us, we weren&#39;t greeted though waiters were passing by for 5 minutes. They looked so stressed with a restaurant half empty. Service could definitely use some work here. This restaurant has potential since the food is fairly good.   

Definitely worth a try if you&#39;re patient with service. Hopefully, there can be some improvement."

Cool spot. 
Decent service. 

Worse chicken and waffles ever.

Please don&#39;t put chicken and waffles on your menu if your chicken has 0 flavor -not even salt and pepper- and it&#39;s dry. Or if the waffle is served cold and the fruit based syrup is so bitter it&#39;s acerbic. What&#39;s weird is the waiter pumped it up like its &#34;buttermilk soaked over night yadda yadda.&#34;

I really wanted to like this place because it&#39;s right down the street.

I first tried ediBOL through an Uber Eats promotion, but they are so close to my work, I just pick it up in person now.

They have super reasonable prices for the quality and quickness. This food at, say, Cafe Gratitude would easily cost $5-7 more.They give you a generous portion that really fills you up without feeling heavy and can be saved for later. It&#39;s also suitable for vegetarians.

Right now, I&#39;m super addicted to the BOLicious. I also had the pickle chips, which were AWESOME, as was the dipping sauce for them. My coworker got the ramen cold bowl, and she really liked it, too. And the bowls are only $9 before tax and tip!

You can also order your food, and they&#39;ll meet you at the car and hand it over if you pay over the phone or in the app.

If you want to try them, you can get $15 off Uber Eats delivery (that&#39;ll cover the cost of one &#34;BOL,&#34; tax, and delivery...aka free!) using the code eats-khmsbdx8ue when you sign up. It&#39;s separate from the regular Uber app. However, they also have their own delivery that is about $1 less.

Each dish that I tried was amazing and definitely different. it&#39;s located in the arts district by cafe gratitude. There&#39;s a lot of street parking and there&#39;s also a parking lot where you can get validation. My friend and I shared a couple of dishes together: pretzel grilled cheese, vegiBOL, &amp; Honey Citrus. 

Pretzel Grilled Cheese ($8): At first I thought this was going to be very heavy in a way where I would get tired of it easily... but it was actually really good where I wanted more! It&#39;s a pretzel grilled cheese and onion sandwich with a dijon mustard coating. You should eat the as soon as it comes out because the melted cheese was perfect with the pretzel! The pretzel itself was made perfectly, it was not dry and had that great pretzel texture. The mustard coated the pretzel, which gave it a nice char and crunch on the outside. mmm it was seriously ... so good

Honey Citrus ($9): I really enjoyed the honey citrus; it was light and fresh. It had roasted cauliflower, green beans, edamame, quinoa, grapefruit, pecans and this tangy citrus dressing.The pecans were sweet and crunch... they were addicting! Although it sounds like a random yet simple combination, they all complemented each other very well. I kind of preferred this over the vegiBOL just because it had this very refreshing and light taste.

vegiBOL ($11): the vegibol is totally different from the honey citrus. It consisted of chickpeas, heirloom rice, wedges, crispy poached egg, and candied almonds. When i saw the crispy poached egg, I was so amazed! This dish is a bit heavier than the honey citrus, but still very enjoyable. The rice on the bottom of the dish had a smokey taste; similar to a stone pot rice. 

I would definitely come back! Everything was amazing; the owner came to greet us at the end, and asked us if we enjoyed the food. Since we ordered so much, she packed us the leftovers."

I&#39;ve been here twice now. Recently tried one of the hot bowls.  The dishes have all the right ingredients and are well thought out .

The &#34;citrus slaw&#34; was shredded cabbage and carrot with a squirt of lemon. Not even sure if it has salt and pepper.

As soon as we walked in, we were greeted and seated. This time, instead of randomly picking from the menu, I went with what Andrea recommended which were her favorites.

Pretzel Grilled Cheese: The Pretzel Bun was great. It was super crispy and flavorful. I&#39;ve never had mustard inside a grilled cheese but it definitely works. The caramelized onions inside were delicious. This would be the perfect beer food!

Roasted Garlic &amp; Herbed Pork Hash with Crispy Egg and Tomatillo Crema: This dish was amazing. The Pork Belly Hash was fatty, crispy, salty and had a bit of sweetness since I believe it had raisins. Andrea also added a side of Cheddar Buttermilk Biscuit which was incredible - very flavorful yet light at the same time. I would come back and get this again.

Honey Citrus: This is what my GF ordered even though Andrea recommended her French Toast Custard. The bowl came with roasted cauliflower, greens, quinoa, pecans and dressing. I am not the biggest healthy or green person in terms of food (I like meat) but I really enjoyed this as well. It was light and refreshing - perfect for SoCal weather. The cauliflowers are to die for - I really enjoyed them on my 1st visit and this time they didn&#39;t disappoint either. My GF destroyed this dish.

Since we didn&#39;t get to try Andrea&#39;s French Toast Custard, she made us a French Toast Custard with Ice Cream dessert which really hit the spot. The toast literally melted in our mouths - really good.

I will definitely be back and get some more of cauliflower which I am sure has some crack in it since its so good. Thank you Andrea for an amazing meal!"

The owner/chef Andrea invited me back for a complimentary meal so I could give the restaurant another try, after my initial review where the signature BOLicious rice bowls my friend and I had for a Friday dinner were too salty.

This time I had a brunch bowl on a Saturday afternoon. I had the Roasted Garlic &amp; Herb Pork Hash bowl and the kitchen deliberately made it less salty. It came with a crispy poached egg, tomatillo crema, candied almonds and pickled raisins, all atop a bed of shredded meat that had been crispy charred on the edges. It was perfectly seasoned and not overly salty this time. The best part of the dish was the large disc of a cheddar buttermilk biscuit it came with -- I was told they couldn&#39;t reduce the salt on the biscuit but as it turned out it was not overly salty to me. Seriously, this breakfast bowl was one of the best hashes I&#39;ve had given the variety of tasty ingredients included, large portion, and, mainly, that amazing biscuit. Chef Andrea, who spent time talking to me about how she makes her dishes during my second visit, told me that she especially loves to bake so I think the baked goods are some of the best things here.

I was also treated to a sampling of the restaurant&#39;s popular rice fritters, which use the same tamari-marinated heirloom rice as in the lunch/dinner bowls. The rice is battered and fried and served with a lemon glaze. Even though this is the same tamari-soaked rice as in the bowls, it didn&#39;t seem salty here. 

I enjoyed the celery refreshaBOL (drink) and it was not overly sweet; it was refreshing with the fresh mint, cucumber, and celery flavors.

The dish that stood out the most? The French toast custard was really outstanding and not overly sweet. It&#39;s basically a French toast that has been soaked long enough that the bread becomes almost custard like. Then it&#39;s griddled so the edges and hard and caramelized while the center stays soft like custard. I probably will come back to ediBOL just for this, honestly. I had it brunch style which was just like eating bread pudding, but it&#39;s usually served as a dessert with vanilla ice cream on top. Heck yeah!

After my return visit I do think this restaurant has some good offerings, especially for brunch, but I would probably still caution them when I order not to make things too salty. I&#39;m appreciative to Chef Andrea for her kindness, generosity and listening to customer feedback...and I&#39;ve already recommended that French toast custard to my friends!"

There was a party going on outside when we visited, as well as fire alarms blaring every 20 minutes or so (fire alarm testing is attached to the building for the apartments), but it was an interesting place.

We tried an item from the brunch and lunch/dinner menu-- I actually can&#39;t get over the BOLicious with pork belly. Actually, mainly the pork belly because it was awesome! The bowl feels healthy and there was plenty of food. There was an interesting mix of textures and flavors-- I adored the spice from the shichimi to the crispy poached egg! Yum! I almost didn&#39;t feel like sharing, but I had to. We had gotten a weird dish for brunch.

So Chicken &amp; Waffles sounds pretty normal for breakfast/brunch fare, right? WRONG. The chicken wasn&#39;t crispy as it looked because it was a small bit of chicken heavily breaded in a corn dog-like batter. And the batter was sweet. The waffle itself is already sweet and with the addition of syrup, it is pretty much going to give you a sugar rush already. But the chicken was strange and the whole thing was soft, not crispy. The dish was sweet on sweet where disappointment takes the place of excitement when you&#39;re expecting a salty and sweet contrast. This dish we tried to work on, but I took home to give away the leftovers, with my buddy commenting, &#34;That looks more and more unappetizing as we go on [walking to the car]&#34;. Yeah, I&#39;d skip this dish.

BUT the BOLicious was great and our server was awesome! The chef also makes a lot of homemade items for her dishes, like the pickled kohlrabi which we both tried for the first time (and subsequently liked) so there is a good amount of effort being put into the food, which is always appreciated."

::Drinks::
I got a hot Japanese Green Tea with honey and I liked it.  The presentation was cute, a long wooden stick with a tea bag hanging.  

::Food::
Under the Bol-Wich I tasted the Pretzel Grilled Cheese.  It has cheddar cheese, mustard, and caramelized onion.  We also added grilled chicken and bacon which was $3 extra.  From the Brunch Bols I got the Roasted Garlic and Herbed Pork Hash.  The Pork Hash was topped with yellow raisins, almonds, and pickled onions (I think).  It also came with crispy poached egg which I thought was creative.  I also got the biscuit that had green onion pieces.  This dish had a herby flavor which I didn&#39;t really like.  From the two dishes I liked the Pretzel Grilled Cheese.

To start I love the idea of the owner coming out and asking how everything went. You don&#39;t often get this type of attention from location owners and it&#39;s a very positive thing to practice. 

The food here was soooo good. Very fresh, very different to say the least but it was every bit tasteful my wife mentioned. 

The staff here was real friendly and helpful as well. We stopped by here on a Saturday and it wasn&#39;t busy at all. They do have mimosas and few other drinks for the drinking group but the best part here is there food.

This location was easy to get to and free parking so can&#39;t beat that. It&#39;s located under some brand new housing complexes and looks like other shops are opening up in the area which will make this place even that much better. I will be back!"

I was hesitant to try this place before because I thought there was nothing special about Asian bowls. Finally I decided to give it a try because I ran out of idea of where to eat for Sunday brunch. Came here on Sunday for brunch, the first impression of this restaurant was its modern and bright looking. We got seated right away but waited for almost 10 min to get water.  There were two different waiters asking us if we needed water back to back. I think this restaurant might need to work on seats assignment to waiters because they had no idea of who taking care of which table. 

Roasted Cauliflower- 5 Star
This was my favorite dish on the day. The cauliflower was roasted perfectly. I like how they made it taste a little sour and salty. The caramelized pecan was crispy and add a different structure to the dish. There was a lot of flavor going on in this dish but I just couldn&#39;t stop eating it.

Shrimp and Grits- 3 Star
This was okay. The shrimp tasted fresh and creamy parmesan grits was nothing special. In fact, I did not taste much parmesan flavor there. What I like in this dish is that they are generous to give enough shrimp for my dish!

Bolicious with pork belly add on- 4 Star 
The pork belly was juicy and yummy. A bunch of flavor was going on in the dish. It was also my first time to try crispy poached egg and it was different and interesting. I enjoyed it very much. 

The owner came to us and greeted to us in the end of the meal. She was super friendly. But then same thing happened when we tried to pay bill, one waiter came to give us check after we paid the bill from another waiter. Again, I think the restaurant need to organize this better. Besides that, the restaurant did a pretty good job in terms of  adding a lot of flavor in their dish."

Ambiance: clean, modern chic look with wide open windows, there&#39;s also patio seating
Service:  waiter attentive and food came out fast

Food
- Pretzel grilled cheese wedges:  great appetizers.  There are 4 pieces.  Quite original.  Nice juxtaposition of salty and sweet of the onion.  Very interesting dish
- Lemon Rosemary Mini Pork Hash: very meaty and light.  Almonds and homemade pickles were a nice contrast
- BOLicious- hot bowl with fried rice and pork belly.   Very yummie and came with deep fried egg.  This is a must try here.  You won&#39;t regret it
- BOLina- regular fried eggs over corn tortillas and beans.  It&#39;s good but pretty average
- BorBOleta- it&#39;s a brazilian seafood stew.  However skip this dish.  It&#39;s pricy at $17.50.  The mahi was bit overcooked.  There is no egg and rice is swimming in sauce
- PleasuraBol- this is a MUST try if you like fruity drinks.  It is a strawberry, rhubarb, hibiscus drink with cava and shochu.  It&#39;s a great fresh fruity blend of fruits that don&#39;t normally go together.  It&#39;s super refresching

Parking:  street parking but was easy to get in this neighborhood

I was here a few months back for a YEE and EdiBOL served us that night. I remember dining on yummy grilled cheese pretzel bread; miso peanut ramen noodles and BOLicious rice pork bowl.

Today, I got to dine with some old and new fellow Yelpers and today&#39;s luncheon was awesome (thank you for the invite Dana!)  It was hearty, filling and healthy and affordable too. I got the ($8.00) grilled cheese pretzel bread that I split with Gloria R., and for own entrée Honey Citrus dish ($9 + $3.50 added for protein lemon ginger chicken) which consists of lemon ginger chicken; sweet potato quinoa, curry cauliflower with edaname and sliced green and red bell peppers with candied pecans. 

Both dishes were delicious and the Honey citrus dish was huge and will not leave you hungry! The dish is super hearty and covers the entire bowl and so totally worth it for $12.50. The grilled cheese pretzel bread was cheesy and not overly greasy, and they eased up on the red onions this time, yay! I left feeling happy and satisfied. 

Chef and owner Andrea came out and greeted us and apologized for the long wait on our meals and gave us complimentary desserts: lemon ricotta fritters with light powder dusting on top. Surprisingly, it was really good and not salty. I thought it was mascapone at first, but no, it was ricotta and it fried nicely and was a sweet ending to our luncheon.

Before we left, we all took a bunch a pics of our food and fellow Yelpers. A wonderful and tasty experience and a great day of meeting new Yelpers and seeing old ones again.

Afterwards, we headed over to the Pie Hole as recommended by Joseph A., in continuation of our day."

Get the pretzel cheesy bites as an appetizer. Just do it (*picture Shia lebeouf saying it in his super angry voice*).  Oh dear god...probably one of my favorites! The pretzel is warm, soft and not too salty all while pressed &amp; held together with a generous portion of melted cheese.

The Bolicious is my BOL of choice. Top that with beef or shrimp and you have a winner. The mix of veggies is perfect and the crispy poached egg completes it all. I still don&#39;t get how that works, but damn is it good!"

Everything you could want in a seasonally inspired fresh flavorful bowl that&#39;s bursting with colors and life.  Owner and head chef Andrea Uyeda is probably the sweetest lady of all time.  Somehow has time to walk around and make sure all her customers are happy and satisfied with their food, asking how their day is going and explaining her artisan food practice in full detail.  I&#39;ve never met Mrs. Fields from Mrs. Field&#39;s Cookies but I imagine her to be just like Uyeda, tender love and care...minus the amazing warm and soft cookies replaced with ridiculously awesome crispy poached eggs.

I like the sleek, industrial look they have going on. Upon walking in, my friend and I were told to sit wherever we&#39;d like. The menu is simple and straight forward: Cool BOLs, Hot BOLs, Little BOLs, etc. I decided on the Honey Citrus Bol, which comprised of quinoa and lentils (my fave!) as well as perfectly curried cauliflower and caramelized pecans. Now, I&#39;ve never been a fan of pecans but I found these pecans so enticing. It was pretty filling and I was able to take some leftovers home.

Every meal comes in little white bowls.  Most of the bowls were like a large teacups. We ordered wings and thought we were getting regular wings but they were &#34;crockpot styled wings&#34; not very good. It was like flavored boiled wings. They advertised a lemonade when we first got in and it sounded delicious. It was good but one glass (not refillable) was $6. I wish I knew beforehand. Good but not that good.

The Arts District is becoming a destination, and I think the word is getting out.  Upon arriving, we got a validation ticket if we went to the local shops.  Knowing we wanted to eat here, sure thing.  The menu is kind of scant, but the taste is of a mixture from Asia and the southern states, calling for shrimp and grits alongside coconut milk broths for ramen and seafood dishes.  The chef brings out the flavors so dramatically, that it actually is a surprise to eat such rich tasting foods from a small storefront restaurant.  The seafood tasted fresh, and we were lucky that we came on a weekend, when brunch is served.  So the son has the pork hash with eggs, which is something I usually get, and the wife had pork belly ramen, which was delicious, for the small amount she shared with me.  The restaurant has all modes of eating from table service, take-out and evening bicycle delivery for those starving artists.

During my most recent visit, I found the food to be small in portions, overpriced and lackluster service.

On a Saturday afternoon, my lunch partner and I came here for lunch. ediBOL is hidden inside the small plaza where Cafe Gratitude is.  The restaurant has a very industrial vibe to it and has inside and outside seating. 

We were given two menus to order off of - brunch and lunch/dinner.  The lunch/dinner menu consists of healthy hot and cold bowls.  If you want protein, that will cost extra.  My friend ordered the cheddar buttermilk biscuit off the brunch menu.  I ordered the BOLicious bowl with lemon ginger chicken (+3.50).  Fifteen minutes later, our food arrived.  I felt so bad for my friend as her cheddar buttermilk biscuit was so tiny! My BOLicious bowl with lemon ginger chicken was super tiny as well.  The BOLicious bowl consisted of a variety of vegetables topped with lemon ginger chicken and an egg. It was tasty, but too overpriced! Our meal was close to $15 each and we were still left hungry! 

The service we received during our visit was pretty lackluster.  The waitress didn&#39;t come over to take our orders until I flagged someone down.  She also barely checked up on us.  When we asked for refills for our water, she forgot and had to be reminded.

Let me just explain what we ordered. My girlfriend and I shared a miso peanut ramen chicken bol and a black bean soup. Everything was delicious!
EdiBOL takes a different approach to the bowl concept, offering healthy meals for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. You&#39;ll find that that the meals come in bowl form but that doesn&#39;t necessarily restrict their creativity. Rest assured that your meal will not only be tasty but also look wonderfully presentable. If you have trouble choosing what you want the servers are pretty helpful, at least ours was. Or you might even get a visit from the owner herself, who&#39;s more than happy to recommend some of her favorites. That&#39;s how we ended up choosing our meal.

For 15 dollars, their meal includes a starter, a bowl, and lemon ricotta fritters for dessert which is a pretty good deal.

Their starters, either fried pickles or fried rice fritters are both good and just the right portion. The rice fritter was quite an interesting experience texture wise and still packed a savory punch with a hint of lemon. Worth checking out! 

For the bowls I had a vegibol and my mom had the traditional bowl. What stood out to us the most was the poached egg which I believe is first poached then fried, something we had never tried before.  Dine LA also allows you to pick a meat to put on top of your bowl. Both the pork belly and the beef worth quite tasty too. The problem is that between the egg, meat, sautéed veggies, unami rice, and pickled relish, your mouth enters in to sensory overload and can become a salt bomb in your mouth.

The fritters for dessert were okay, nothing special or bad about them. 

Service was okay, had to remind the waiter a couple of times to refill my glass of water but, I am a guzzler when it comes to that. 

At the end of the day, nothing bad but besides some interesting things going on with some of their items their food as a whole was just okay, at least from my perspective. Glad I checked them out though Dine La, but probably won&#39;t be back again."

The owner Andrea shares her love for cooking by opening ediBOL and her passion shows in the Japanese-inspired hearty, healthy, and flavorful dishes. ediBOL is located on the end of the new, quiet (for now, I hope) One Santa Fe complex. The restaurant along with the plaza reflects the changing values of the Arts District with the forward-thinking menu and hipster-ish, aesthetically pleasing modern decor.

[ FOOD ]
All of the dishes are what I would call light, Japanese-inspired comfort food. The menu consists of generally the cold and hot &#34;BOLs&#34; (bowls). They all seem to be vegetarian-friendly. My favorite is the BOLicious hot bowl, and I added garlic seared shrimp to mine. The pork belly, the most popular topping, is also delicious! The umami fried heirloom rice is so good, and I don&#39;t know how they make the crispy poached egg which came out perfect. I think I&#39;d want to try the miso peanut ramen cold bowl next time, as well as the brunch menu and the &#34;BITEs&#34; that are available only after 5pm for some reason. The bowls ended up a little on the expensive side (my BOLicious was $9 plus $4 for adding shrimp), but you&#39;re paying for the quality, service, and ambience.

[ SERVICE ]
Service is impeccable here as my table was well-attended from the moment we walked in and throughout the entire meal (I must also mention we went during off-lunch hours so there were only two other tables, but they seem to be well-staffed even then). Both the owner Andrea and the servers took time to explain the menu for our first visit and then checked back in frequently to see how we were.

[ PARKING ]
Parking is free for 2 hours with validation in the One Santa Fe lot that&#39;s shared with Cafe Gratitude and the other boutique shops in the complex. That&#39;s pretty much the best and only option as street parking is ridiculously scarce and packed, especially during the day. The lot isn&#39;t big so parking will become a real pain once this complex and the surrounding block is completed."

I love that their dishes are made vegetarian based and give the option to add meat, so it&#39;s a nice option for a variety of friends (meat and non-meat eaters).

I rolled my eyes upon reading the name, and again on reading the concept description. It really is a restaurant centered around foods served in bowls, under the banner of the most basic pun on the L.A. food scene.

I went for Sunday brunch with a large party, and we were able to make a reservation online. Turns out we didn&#39;t need one--despite decent Yelp hype, the place was calm through the peak Sunday brunch hour (we were there from around 11 to 1). I didn&#39;t see the interior but I liked the patio, and found the whole surrounding Arts District complex disconcerting but interesting. It was this huge mall with like boutique skincare and fancy ice cream that apparently sprouted from the ground over the last year.

Service was odd. Our waiter was pleasant enough, but he was interrupted by the owner after he explained the ediBOL concept and was halfway through taking our order. She sent him to attend to a different table then gave us the whole spiel all over again and started to retake our order before bringing him back in. Not a big deal, but kind of off. I also ordered a bloody mary which never came. Our server told me they were out of bloody mary mix but that the bartender was going to make a new batch. He said it&#39;d be another ten minutes, which I didn&#39;t mind, but then, when I was almost done eating, he came back and said the bartender hadn&#39;t started making the mix after all. He asked if I wanted something else to drink, and I said no, as it was apparent I&#39;d have to pay for it, half an hour after I ordered my first one.

The food was decent, though conceptually very confusing (lots of food comes in bowls! that is not a category!). We got an order of pretzel grilled cheese wedges for the table, and these were okay, pretzel bread with melty sharp cheddar, meunster, caramelized onion, and stone ground mustard. Nothing special, but good for a bite or two. I had the BOLicious for my meal, and this was pretty on point. It was a rice bowl with umami fried heirloom rice, crispy poached egg, seared greens, pickled tomatoes, kohlrabi wedges, cucumber scallion relish, and homemade togarashi. I got mine topped with pork belly and tried some of my friend&#39;s garlic beef version too. The rice was great--I don&#39;t know what &#34;umami fried&#34; means, but the rice was nice and toasty, and I enjoyed the lovely egg and pickled tomatoes. The pork belly was on the tough, dry side, but the garlic beef was tasty. I took half of my bowl home and feel like it&#39;ll do well with some sriracha. My husband got the chicken and waffles, and this was fine. It came with crispy honey lemon chicken over a housemade waffle with caramelized pecans and apricot ginger syrup. Solid waffle, but the chicken was battered and fried in the style of Korean food court tempura--not bad, but less crispy and juicy than I like in fried chicken.

One of my friends brought a pie for dessert, and we left after our server informed us there&#39;d be a cake cutting fee of $1 a person. Fair enough, though I wonder if I could&#39;ve traded that for my lost bloody mary. It was an odd brunch overall, and though I enjoyed my rice bowl, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll go back."

Edibol is on our list of must try places. My friend booked a reservation for our big party for today.

In all honesty, I had a hard time finding parking but alas I was lucky after the 4th time going around to find parking. 

When we all got seated we were told that the Dine LA menu was only for weekday lunch even though my friend who reserved our table asked if they have the menu available during the weekend lunch and got an affirmative yes over the phone. Our server was generous enough to check in with the manager who decided to let us use the Dine LA menu because of the mishap that had happened during the reservation process. The service was superb, our sever was very accommodating. I am really glad how solution oriented they were.

I had the rice fritter, the pork hash, and the dessert fritter with a drip coffee. The food was alright nothing really stood out to me. Everything was executed properly nothing was over or under cooked. I did think the hash was a bit sweet because of the amount of the raisins in it and the biscuit was a bit different- it looked like a cookie and the texture was different.

Over all my experience was pleasant, I would come back to give this place another try with the hopes of finding a favorite dish."

They are delicious!

ediBOL is located in a newer apartment complex very close to the tracks.  There&#39;s a main parking lot for the whole complex that I parked in and then you&#39;ve got a walk through a courtyard over to the restaurant.  It&#39;s a bit larger inside than it looks and has quite the cool vibe on the inside.  They&#39;ve got a really nice patio as well.  The owner is super personal and takes a lot of pride in the way she created her food.  I would be too if my restaurant turned out like this!

The food is awesome.  It&#39;s a bowl concept, but the mixture of ingredients in the bowls are super flavorful and the ingredients used are super fresh and certainly on the healthier side.  Thank God we live in a time when people have figured out how to make healthy foods taste just as amazing as their unhealthy counterparts!  I recommend the BOLiscious with pork belly on top.

The menu says casual bowls, but the venue is fancy.  I was expecting to pay at the cashier, but I guess this is... slow fast food?  Not sure, but it was alright.

The prices seem reasonable, but then you realize that meat is extra!  But I guess that&#39;s fine because it&#39;s sit down...?

Pretzel Grilled Cheese Bol-wich with Bacon (8+3=11) - This was deliciously cheesy, but for that $3 charge the bacon was meager and lost.  There needs to be 3 large strips of bacon!

Miso Peanut Ramen + Chicken (9+3.50=12.50) - This reminded my friend of a standard Japanese dish - hiyashi chuka, though not as good.  He was pretty disappointed.

Bolicious + Pork Belly (9+4 =13) - I remember it being delicious and I finished it all.  The pork belly didn&#39;t make an impression on me however.

I think this place would do better if it were more casual.  Take out the tacky vegas decor and make it quick and easy to match the menu.  It was awkward to have a waiter."

I&#39;ve been here twice now, tried 4 different things on the menu, and sad to say, nothing has wow&#39;ed me. I really like the concept I just don&#39;t think the combination of ingredients is impressive. At the Yelp event, we had the pretzel grilled cheese bites for starters. I don&#39;t like pretzels even at their best so my opinion would be unfair here. We also sampled the miso peanut ramen bowl and we had the Bolicious bowl with added pork belly. Meh x2. On my second visit, I tried the Bolina bowl with fried chicken.

If I refused to make a trip to the grocery store and tried to make Mexican breakfast with only the ingredients in my fridge, I would expect it to come out like the Bolina. It wasn&#39;t that it was bad, it was just missing some umfph. They love to pickle pretty much everything here so definitely expect some acidity with your meal.

Staff are super sweet and they have local beer on tap. Hoorah!"

First, the apps: Pretzel grilled cheese. Get this whatever the case. Even if you&#39;re not hungry, get it. Perfect warm, pillowy, gooey bite. I&#39;m not into fried pickles, but the chips had the right amount of crispiness and a salty tang. I&#39;m a fan of the rice fritters --  nice chew to them. 

The BOLicious with the pork belly and the pork hash are the paths you should take. So flavorful. It&#39;s like someone is playing the xylophone with your taste buds. 

I wasn&#39;t a fan of the strawberry rhubarb drink, too sweet for our liking. But the blackberry drink I had on my second visit was tasty. 

The lemon ricotta fritters are a lovely ending to the meal. 

Take note, for groups they have a set menu for guests to choose entrees from. For $21, you get two apps (pickle chips and grilled cheese -- yum!), a bol to select and lemon ricotta fritters, which is an awesome value.

It&#39;s a true Christmas miracle. Seriously, we circled the block once and then I saw it. Like a silver-lined cloud ascending from heaven! There was a parking lot entrance. I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes, so we pulled in and it was real! Not a mirage, but a real parking lot with plenty of spaces! We didn&#39;t need valet or some quarters for the meter. Why haven&#39;t I been here before?!? 

The space is super narrow and has plenty of seating inside and out. There was food and desserts displayed in the case, but there were also 2 menus on the wall. The main menu showed pricing and the made to order dishes. The 2nd menu features their Daily Specials. I opted for a Brisket Bowl and my friend did the protein with 2 sides. She chose the Hanger Steak with mac &amp; cheese and an arugula and kale salad.

My brisket bowl had a lovely salad on top with the most tender poached egg. The daikons added a nice crunch and acidity. More would be nice! The brisket was tasty, not as tender as I imagined, but still delicious. The rice wan&#39;t exactly calrose, but something similar. 

The Hanger Steak was cooked medium rare and not a bit was left over. The mac &amp; cheese was pretty good. But the salad was a tad too sour. Granted it was a lemon vinegarette, but a little goes a long way. I think my mouth watered at the thought of the tangy dressing. Not excatly a good thing. Maybe less dressing next time?

The staff was so nice! They helped us choose what to order. 

On to the desserts, the main event lol! I got a passion fruit glazed donut.  It was brioche. I almost, and I mean almost licked my plate to get every bit of the beautifully tasting passion fruit glaze. It might just be my favorite flavor glaze, for now! The buttermilk cake was super moist and almost had a tres leches feel to it. It had layers on layers and berries of all sorts.

There were so many other desserts we wanted to try, butI guess we will have to wait until next time!"

Another thing that I never ordered again is their sweets.

They had this really good Mashed Potatoes but I haven&#39;t seen it in a while.  I hope they will serve it again.  And also their Coconut-Basmati Rice.

Here&#39;s what we got:
Pork belly sandwich - by description this sounded really good. Jalepeno slaw with cabbage. It was not as good as I had hoped. The bread was a sturdy bread that held the sandwich well but the filling was just mediocre. Lacked in flavor for sure. I wish there was a pickled component to this sandwich and that it was just seasoned better. 

Sides:
Broccoli - this was tasty. Slightly spicy and cooked well.
Beet salad - not the best I&#39;ve had but it was okay. Again could&#39;ve been seasoned better. 
Fennel and savoy - had pieces of grapefruit. It was light and fresh. Pretty good. 
Curried lentils - flavor was good.
Coconut basmati rice - had nuts and greens. This was probably my favorite thing I had. It was flavorful and had different textures. Definitely check this one out!

AS ALWAYS........

Steph C., my sister from another Mistuhrrr&#39; had already reviewed this place as being one of her favorites! What&#39;s that statement about &#34;great minds&#34; - ?

Located on Sunset and Hyperion within the ever-so-trendy and hipster-inundated Silverlake precinct - I&#39;m just as elated to say I reside a trot around the mulberry bush from this local neighborhood eatery.

For what it&#39;s worth, this place is about the size of a shot glass, yet....manages to make the most of it by offering variance in absolute abundance.

With meager inside seating as well as a pet-friendly outside patio-esque area that surrounds the forefront,...., I really dig this joint. 

My humble recommendation however, is choosing the latter of the two options (as opposed to dining in) or simply requesting take-out altogether. Bearing the closeness of interior table-side proximity in mind, it&#39;s a bit impractical to grub while being (dare I say) &#34;foraged upon&#34;.

With a private back lot reserved for limited time parking, diners are enabled to select from options inclusive to organic mac/cheese, roasted pollo, hearty salads and a plethora of dessert options. Each item seems to encompass a flare of eclecticism, i.e.: the &#34;salmon belly tacos served with jalapeno slaw, green onions, and Sriracha aioli&#34; for just around $14.00.

#yew&#39;-fancy-hungh?

The overall concept I&#39;ve derived seems to waft off a reasonably priced (dependent upon what one orders) &#34;grade school cafeteria feel&#34;; think, .....your local grocer&#39;s deli and while I&#39;d hardly refer to the food bestowed here as being any bit &#34;revolutionary&#34;, the ear to ear smiles from the establishment&#39;s employees is all the more indicative that customer service, my fellow Yelp friends ---- IS.

While &#34;trendy&#34;, &#34;hip&#34; and &#34;touristy&#34; are all adjectives I&#39;d easily use to modify this establishment, -----&#34;FORAGE&#34;------ seems to be right on the money as upon conducting my usual restaurant &#34;fact check&#34;, I was made aware that shortly after opening a few years ago, owner Jason Kim invited local backyard farmers in to present their crops to him for incorporation into his menu.

Supporting local harvest?

Now that&#39;s my idea of star-worthy and is truly worthy (last time,... I promise) -----FORAGING one&#39;s way to."

Then after eating that I had the pork belly sandwich.. loved the bread first and foremost, the pork was juicy and crispy as it should be, the slaw, although a hint too sour for me def enhanced that sandwich experience. On the side, I tried the quinoa salad, this one was a bit bland with too much onion flavoring in the salad, this one I could have gone without. I must also add that they had numerous selections of their baked goods (desserts). The place gets busy which is a good sign but the place is quite small with very very limited parking.

However, the reason I eat out is because if I go out and buy all the ingredients to make my own sandwich, it costs more than just going to get one. Not really true in this case.

So here&#39;s my summary.....pork belly sandwich.  No sides. Too much bread?  No way.  Can&#39;t taste the pork belly?.oh yes the hell I could.  But let me make this short and sweet. 

The effin jalapeno Cole slaw is SO FLAVORFUL that I didn&#39;t really need the pork belly.  I mean it was amazing as a vegetarian  sandwich. I could only eat half when I got it.  It was big.....is &#34;what she said&#34;.... but it tasted so good,  I mauled the other half while my friend drove us to our next shopping destination.:/ it was not pretty since I had to navigate directions...but totally worth it. 

I also got the biscuit.  Um. Yum. Yum yum yum yum yum..mmmmmm. #yum  My friend got the potato salad and just about had a vegetarian mouth-gasm. #truestor

Is it pricey?  Probably yes if you&#39;re as cheap as they come.  It&#39;s not a fancy sit down restaurant but the flavor in most of these dishes are worth the price they come in.  

The service,  my review is not for the service only because there was one douche bag guy who I asked for a paper menu and he arrogantly pointed out the hand written menu board behind the counter.  Ok bro.  I get it.  But you don&#39;t have to be a #dicktracy about it and since that sandwich was EVERYTHING,  I totally forgive you.  I&#39;m totally going back tomorrow for the exact same dish. 

There&#39;s parking in the back and water is self serve in ACTUAL glass glasses...kudos.  Also there&#39;s a gelato spot 2 doors down with the most amazing almond fig. #TRUSTME"

I guess if you&#39;re going to borrow a concept, you are definitely pointed in the right direction.

If you&#39;ve been to Mendocino Farms, the idea is familiar -- casual, but healthful(ish), natural food that is pricier than fast food, but cheaper than a nice sit-down, consisting of quality meats, sides and desserts. 

Arriving for lunch I ordered the protein+2 sides that consisted of steak with a chimichurri sauce with a kale salad and curried lentils. My wife ordered the pork belly sandwich and we split a chocolate chip cookie. 

Some meals come served on a quality steel tray far fancier than one you ever got in school, while others you have to wait to be brought to your table. Overall food was more than good. I wish the steak was warmer and rarer, but the flavors were there and the sides were great. My wife&#39;s pork belly was awesome, but I mean, it&#39;s hard to go wrong with pork belly. The cookie was also tasty -- chewy and maybe 60% chocolate chip. 

I definitely enjoyed the meal, and look forward to going back to try a few different combinations."

We were staying in an air bnb and our host left a list of restaurants with explanations...the explanation for Forage was simply &#34;Bomb salads.&#34;  While I didn&#39;t have a salad, he was right about the quality of this place.

My wife had black-eyed peas (that were delicious!), a salad she said was fantastic, and quiche (which was cold, our only complaint of the meal).  I had a salmon bowl that was filled with all kinds of delicious goodness.  Ultimately, thoroughly enjoyed the meal here.  The whole chicken and brisket that were available looked amazing.  There was a lot of deliciousness to go around clearly.

Only complaints are the aforementioned cold quiche (which was served as intended but we didn&#39;t know it would be served cold and probably wouldn&#39;t have ordered it).

The roasted broccoli was probably the best thing we ate and the chicken was decent. We expected the pork belly sandwich to be what everybody said it be...&#34;amazing,&#34; according to other reviews but honestly it was also lacking in flavor, the pork belly tasted like a non-tenderized dry pork chop and the slaw in the sandwich wasn&#39;t any better, tasted like they chopped up cabbage and didn&#39;t dress it and slapped it on thinking it would be okay.

This place is close by me so I stop by often for lunch. I could eat their salmon bowl everyday. It&#39;s pretty simple and has good flavor and won&#39;t put me in a food coma. The execution of the salmon can vary. I&#39;ve had it at times when the skin was super crispy and good to when it&#39;s soggy and comes right off. However, the salmon fillet itself is always good. The brisket bowl is also good but much heavier and has higher salt content. Their salmon belly tacos are also tasty. I feel like you can&#39;t really go wrong with their specials.

The buffet style offerings are also good, but I prefer only getting the following:
I love the kale and arugula salad. It&#39;s really delicious because the feta that they use is sheep&#39;s milk and milder(so I&#39;ve been told because I normally don&#39;t like feta). The pork shoulder that they&#39;ve been offering recently is also really tasty, but again the execution can vary. Their dessert selection is really great! I always want to sample everything.

On a separate note I&#39;ve had their BBQ mini pie and it was so so. Also, I always want to get excited about the mac and cheese but it usually falls flat for me. It&#39;s kind of bland.

I will continue to go here for reliably healthy, fine-tasting meal options, but I probably wouldn&#39;t send someone visiting town here.

Looking at the menu, the selection just feels like a hybrid version of 80% Tender Greens (plate + sides) and 20% Mendocino Farms (e.g. pork belly sandwich).

Pretty casual, contemporary, clean, and hippie dining environment. Very friendly service.

Pork Belly Sandwich with Cabbage and Jalapeño Slaw, Tomato, and Aioli ($12): Good balance between your protein (pork belly) and veggies. Very similar to Mendocino Farms&#39;s pork belly banh mi sandwich - both were delicious, but I still like Mendocino&#39;s version better.

Market Lettuce with Radishes, Shallots, and Red Wine Vinaigrette (Small, $4): Tasted fresh, but not my type of salad. Pretty expensive for a small salad.

3.5-stars on food. Food quality and service are there, but can you really justify ~$17 for just a sandwich and a small side? I don&#39;t know ... only your wallet can answer that question.

The vegetables just taste like they were grown in your grandma&#39;s backyard and picked just prior to the meal. Call me a sucker but it sure felt like that to me. Whatever mind games they&#39;re playing on me by calling the place Forage must be working! Anyways, the cold side items are all fantastic. This is the only place I&#39;ve been to that actually does the cold side bar thing the RIGHT way. It&#39;s not super overpriced and the portions are more than generous. Amazing concept, right?

The hot foods and entrees are also amazing. The Korean beef bowl is delicious and creative, the salmon belly tacos are tender and savory, everything here is just very well made and very fresh. I absolutely love their mac &#39;n&#39; cheese as well (although I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ve ever disliked mac &#39;n&#39; cheese, heh).

It&#39;s where I would (and do) take any out-of-towner&#39;s looking for real, and really good, food. We live up the street and go here A LOT. And every time I walk in... The glowing, glistening, gorgeously presented farm fresh/local smorgasbord of goodies (how&#39;s that for a sentence?) entices me to get more than I planned on. 

&#34;Oh I&#39;ll just have one of your delicious iced coffees... And that incredible looking cookie!... And the KALE SALAD (do it. Don&#39;t look back).. Annnnd... Maybe that other salad and that quiche annd...&#34; You get the idea. Happens all the time. The food is so fresh and so &#34;clean&#34; (by which I mean simple with no added bad stuff) and SO. GOOD. I&#39;ve never been disappointed. And did I mention I (and my friends) go here a lot?

And with the &#34;hipster&#34; comments I&#39;ll just share my two cents... No one is pretentious here. They&#39;re just working and doing their job and being chill. If you expect or desire something &#34;bigger&#34; (hint: &#34;How many pieces of flare are you wearing?!&#34;) maybe try a place with waiter service (and probably not in Silverlake lol). But if you can let your judgements go, walk in with an open mind and just be real, sincere, and (hopefully) kind... I&#39;m pretty sure the employees will be the same way back. It&#39;s never been an issue in the years I&#39;ve been coming here. And did I mention I come here a lot? Forage is one of my top fave places in town.

A lot of these &#34;cafeteria&#34; types restaurants have been opening up in SoCal (lemonade, urban plates, etc.) which generally I like but the food and choices here were less than exciting. 

I debated getting a portion of Tri-tip and Mac &amp; cheese but I don&#39;t like the idea of food sitting out and being scooped just when I come to order it. I got the salmon burger instead, which was a special. The worker, with great expression, stated that it was huge. So I was like oh ok cool, probably worth the money. Wrong. Not only did it cost just shy of $15 but it was tiny. Like just slightly larger than a slider. The only reason she probably considered it &#34;huge&#34; was because of the height of the brioche bun. 

Even more disappointing was there wasn&#39;t any flavor. The bread tasted like bread. The slaw or what was on it just tasted like cabbage. Not even sure what sauce was suppose to be but it was very plain. The burger itself was decent- fresh tasting salmon. But all in all for the cost I could care less. I had a bite of my friends pork belly sandwich and felt the same way. 

It&#39;s not like anything was BAD but it kinda fell into the stereotype of healthy food being bland and boring."

My friend got the two sides + protein option. I loved the beets she got and also the curried cauliflower. Yum. I will definitely do this next time. She got chicken (dark meat) as her protein, and I honestly thought it was a little plain, but it complemented the sides nicely.

How stupid was that on a scale of one to very?  But in total seriousness, Forage is a solid joint befitting of the neighborhood.  It&#39;s all that you&#39;d expect from a Silverlake eatery--it&#39;s quaint, trendy, and practically bursting with hipster vibes.  I arrived around noon on a Tuesday expecting lines out the door, but the restaurant was fairly mild, meaning that there were approximately 3 available tables.  Upon walking in, you&#39;re faced with a chalkboard menu that sits behind a glass case of irresistible sweets--it&#39;s absolutely cruel, but if you manage to resist the temptation of the dessert sirens and keep your gaze steady, you&#39;ll find a rather enticing menu.  Upon placing your order, you pay before being presented with your food on a literal silver platter.  I kid you not, my order was insta-ready before I even whipped out my camera.

Today, I went with the protein and 2 sides, and opted for a quarter pound of chicken (white meat), a kale salad, and fattoush!  The chicken was roasted and the skin carried a nice sun-kissed tan; with that being said, the tenderness of the chicken wasn&#39;t at all compromised.  The portion was rather generous and plenty for one decently hungry girl; however, I probably can&#39;t speak for a famished man, but I was plenty satisfied.  The fattoush I could probably live without on my next visit (because yes, I do plan on visiting again), but the kale salad is a must!  They do it so right at Forage!  There&#39;s just the right amount of acidity and that&#39;s balanced by a generous, but not too generous, helping of cheese!  It&#39;s great, really.  If I could go back in time, I would actually give up my fattoush for a double helping of kale salad,  In fact, I&#39;d even give up a part of my chicken for a triple serving.  I doubt that&#39;s allowed, but for those that know me, you know that&#39;s a big deal--I am an absolute major grilled chicken type of gal.  

This little Silverlake hot spot is great for a quick and healthy bite!  The food is honest; however, I probably can&#39;t say the same for the servers--they could probably use a bit more sunshine and smiles.  Last I checked, a bit of good cheer was hipster-approved.  Regardless, the location is great and the food is one of those I-did-my-body-a-nice-favor-today type of meals.  It won&#39;t blow you away, but it&#39;s solid--a feel good place with feel good food--what more could you possibly ask for?  

Except a smile of course."

The staff is always so friendly, nice, and welcoming, they keep me coming back. I must say I&#39;m usually skeptical of places with cafeteria style dining, but Forage changed all that. 

As a vegetarian I get bored of restaurants with the same 3-5 options. Sure I&#39;ll consistently eat there but then I&#39;ll get tired of it and never come back. But at Forage  there constantly changing their menu to keep the food interesting and on point. Every time I come in there food always tastes better then the last time.  Everything from there salads to desserts are always fresh, hot, and delicious. Personally, I don&#39;t think Forage is expensive for the fresh quality ingredients they magically prepare. You truly get what you pay for. Good luck trying to pull off healthy, fresh, &#34;fast food&#34; for McDonald&#39;s prices. 

As for desserts, I&#39;ve almost tried everything. By far I&#39;m obsessed with the Lemon pie (pic posted.) The top is so fluffy and light and the lemon filling is tart and tangy. Did I mention the crust is made of saltines, which give it a hint of salt to offset the sweetness of the filling? (Yeah I&#39;ve been watching too much Food Network.) Even though the pie is intense in favor it isn&#39;t heavy and food-coma inducing. Do yourself a favor and make sure to order a dessert with your meal, you won&#39;t regret it.  A lot of there desserts sell out quickly, so if you come in near closing they might not have what your looking for. Be sure to call and ask before driving out b/c if I&#39;m paying .50 cents for parking I&#39;m getting my sweet-tooth on!  

Lastly and the whole reason why I decided to write this review, the legendary German Chocolate Cake. My older sister really wanted a German Chocolate Cake for her birthday (approx. 3 days away.) The German Chocolate Cake is seasonal, although I haven&#39;t been privileged to experience it yet I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s life changing and sells out quickly (like during lunch.) In a last ditch attempt, I called Forage and spoke to Sam about placing a special order, even though it isn&#39;t in season. I was prepared for Sam to tell me no (it was worth a shot), when he surprised me and said yes. Sam took my special order and even said I could pay for it tomorrow since I have to work late. I&#39;m so excited for this cake you&#39;d think it was my birthday! 

Thanks Sam for saving the day! I know my sister will be impressed with the illusive German Chocolate Cake and everyone will love it."

Being in Silver Lake, eating organic and healthy is probably the trendy thing to do. Forage seems to do just that. Props to Mr. Kim for hitting em right between the eyes. 

So here&#39;s my problem with Forage. It is just a bit hyped and over rated. Yes they do have healthy selections, but when you have Mac&amp;cheese on the menu, 9 out of 10 times, people will ALWAYS get the mac&amp;cheese. And that&#39;s definitely not healthy, no matter how organic it is.

Yes, the food looks amazing. But does it taste as good as it looks. Not really. The food is a bit bland, boring, call it what you want. I did get to try the tri-tip. It was properly cooked. Nice and tender. Probably best part of my meal. Wish I had more than 4 or 5 slices of it. Dude, how am I suppose to fulfill my gains? The food and drinks are all good, but not great. 

Here&#39;s the main reason why I would probably not come back, my dinner came out to almost $20 with an ice tea. Most expensive over the counter food ever. As good as the food tastes, the bill left me with a bad taste. 

My friend and I got here at 5:30pm. There were already a few hungry people waiting to get some of their organic goodness. The place filled up super quick. So come early if you want a seat.

Good concept, good food, terrible value. Wish I didn&#39;t have to break the bank to eat a healthy meal.

I&#39;m not the type to order specials -- I stick w/ what a place is known for -- yet the daily salads are always fantastic, the agua fresca is always seasonal and almost always good and not too sweet, and I&#39;ll be damned if the mac n cheese they serve at the dinner hour isn&#39;t among the best I&#39;ve ever had. Not the cheapest, and I find the protein portions to be small (the fish choice is always too expensive and too small, so I never get it), but overall, you can move through the line at lunch hour with a perfectly cooked tandoori chicken side, a huge helping of really delish salad (kale w/ bread crumbs and goat cheese; bibb w/ citrus, etc), and a carb like pasta or crostini, and be satisfied well into the diner hour. I don&#39;t always love the desserts -- my bad for once ordering a &#34;grapefruit cake (yuck) -- but the choc chip cookie is the best I&#39;ve ever had.

I once had a really bad experience there -- I saw a worker put his hands into a salad in the kitchen, put a handful in his mouth, then use those same saliva-soaked hands to toss the salad again -- and stayed away for nearly a year when the manager doubted my word. All said, I went back, and have been happy there ever since.

They have weird hours, they have the world&#39;s worst parking lot. They have the ambiance of a hyped up place that is overpriced and disappoints but their food is, from my experience, consistently excellent. 

My first experience with Forage was with a pork shoulder rice bowl that I wish they would bring back / make a permanent feature. The pork shoulder was juicy and delicious, the vegetables they put in perfectly compliment and balance out the meat. They also threw in chicharrones!!! Everyone should add chicharrones to their rice bowls 100% of the time. They are perfect for flavor and texture.

Other things I&#39;ve had that were excellent: chicken &amp; ginger porridge, German chocolate cake, (best) Cronut (ever)."

After chatting with the employees, I decided to go with the Pork Belly Sandwich and they were nice enough to give me a small sample of the Kale Salad as I was eyeing it. Pork Belly Sandwich was mind boggling good - I haven&#39;t been that satisfied with a meal In a long time. Pork belly was cooked to perfection and the slaw and aioli was a perfect pairing!

Definitely just A-OK in my opinion, but my boyfriend loves this place for the Kale Salad.

The hanger steak wasn&#39;t anything special, but it was tastey.  The mac and cheese that everyone loves was also just okay.  Nothing too amazing.

I ordered the pork belly sandwich and thought it was difficult to eat.  The bread in particular was too hard and burnt.  It hurt my jaw to chew and I felt like the burned parts were too bitter.  I&#39;m spoiled by Asian style pork belly which is marinated for hours.  The pork belly in this sandwich was so bland in comparison; seasoned only with pepper and salt.

Too expensive to be causal dining.  

Love the coffee."

For the second time I&#39;ve ordered mac&amp;cheese and they&#39;ve put it in a to go soup container so it looks like something my cat threw up when I get it out. Not cool to not care about the take out customers who pay the same as the ones eating there. When I complained to the manager he said I guess we assume people eat out of the containers. Ummm... not Chinese food dude! But hey, maybe you should charge as little and then I wouldn&#39;t care. Bottom line is I&#39;ve complained over and over and I watch when I&#39;m there to make sure they don&#39;t do that but when I have to wait for more mac&amp;cheese and they plate it in the kitchen it always happens. No one seems to care even when I complain about it. In fact they all kinda roll their eyes as if to say, &#34;can you not be so difficult or why are you asking me to do this?&#34; I&#39;ve also watched them put the mac&amp;cheese in the to go container and let it sit there getting cold for 10-15 minutes while they&#39;re waiting to fill the order since the other items are not ready. I&#39;m sure the bulk of their business is take out since Forage is a smaller higher end version of Tender Greens so they really should do a better job at that. Presentation and customer service are key in the food industry. I can&#39;t give it a good rating or continue to patronize the business which is sad give the fact the food is good. I&#39;m also very disappointed that the management hasn&#39;t replied to this review or reached out to apologize which clearly means how little they care about their regular customers.

Even with their &#39;Small&#39; size, I was left more than stuffed.  It can get pricy but it&#39;s no more than CPK prices (yeah, CPK is kind of my measuring stick).

For dessert, I had their Chocolate Bread Pudding and it left nothing to be desired.

Chicken &amp; tortilla bread pudding while great in texture &amp; pretty silky lacked something flavor-wise...heat?
Also, temperature-wise, it was served cold. I asked them to heat it up for me which they graciously did although it took a bit of time to do.

Market lettuce salad was supposed to come with citrus, baby radishes, parsley &amp; avocado buttermilk dressing. Mine was missing the citrus which is funny because as I was eating it, I thought it needed some acid in the form of tomatoes or something. As is, it was heavy on the radishes.

Good food starts with the basics like freshness, quality, texture, taste and temperature. (As in, this meat should at least be warm.) After those essentials have been tended to then we can start getting into creativity, variety, and color. 

I ordered the steak which had been sitting on a plate behind the glass, so it&#39;s not expected to be coming right off the grill, but still you expect steak to have some warmth to it. The meat had flavor, but was chewy and getting worse by the minute as it came to a cool. I tried my friend&#39;s salmon which was more dry than my grandmother&#39;s knee caps. I got a side of butternut squash which was once again cold, coated in sugar. My beet salad was pretty fresh tasting although a simple touch like adding fennel would have gone a long way, taking a decent side order to a great one. 

The service was fast and efficient. 

There are too many great restaurants in LA for this place to be charging $15 a plate for cold food. This is a pitfall of Sunset Junction, having a place full of potential and using its great location to settle for mediocrity.

It is a little pricey, but for good reason. Their food tastes fresh, they tend to use organic ingredients on some dishes, and they definitely put a lot of care into making their everything.

The Garlic Pepper Chicken was also legit. Very garlicky. My wife LOVES garlic and this dish she says is for garlic lovers. Very tasty dish. 

The Pork Pad Thai was good but not great. Was a tad bland but we asked for the Homemade Sweet and Sour sauce and added it to it and completed the taste. 

The food here is very good and good reasonable prices. If we are in the area and are in need of late Thai food we will be coming here!"

Its in the center of pico union. The food is OK. Not the best quality thai but its fine.

Visited this place about 10 times on the way home from work always with my bike. Always brought my bike inside to order to go. Never had a problem. 

Today they kicked me out and would only speak Spanish to me when doing so. I spoke back in English. 
Told them icons here regularly. They still told me to get out in Spanish. 

Not very nice. 

I told them I don&#39;t have a lock and to please reconsider this one time and that I will bring a lock next time. I did not want to leave my bike outside in this neighborhood. 
They did not want to hear it and told me in Spanish to leave it outside otherwise no service.

I&#39;m not complaining because at least Flavors of Thai is close and is actual Thai food, despite the hot food takeout bar which appears to be more Americanized (almost Chinese) in appearances. Ahem, Thai Ocha, anyone? Well, people seem to like it, so I&#39;m not judging. 

Ordered the Pad See Ew and Tom Yum Soup with shrimp. Pad See Ew was fine, but the soup was definitely on the waaayyy too salty side. 

I think the prices are on the high side as well: $9.95 for beef pad see ew, and $10.95 for the soup. 

Again, it&#39;s hard to complain, especially on days like today when one is craving pad see ew and far too hungover to trek out to Thai Town and face the crowds. May go back again on desperate days!"

Orange chicken- completely drenched in their corn starchy sauce and where is the chicken? Literally felt like eating orange goop. 

Pad see ew- bland/ can only taste the crushed pepper they put in. Even the color was weird and not brown like usual. this is something I always order from here and it never tasted like this before. Idk maybe the chef changed.... who knows. 

This is the last time I order from here. So sad because this place was pretty solid:("

The pork within the dish was very dry, almost like jerky; the noodles were very bland. The orange chicken was flat out horrible; it was drowned in an overly sweet and tangy sauce, and was essentially inedible without the white rice they included in our order. As sad as I am to say this. We threw away our leftovers and will probably never dine in the actual restaurant.

As an added note: it took 1 hour and 45 minutes for Eat24 to deliver our order. It was certainly not worth the wait"

Today after a long day, I ordered our usual (green curry with jasmine rice, pad thai and an extra dish that rotates) and egg rolls because we&#39;re fatty and wanted double egg rolls.

I noticed on yelp they have their closing time at 2:00 am. I went to their webpage to look at the menu and I was shocked to see that they had their closing time at 9:00 pm. 

I was so confused so I tried calling and no one was picking up. I wanted to get something good to go home and eat. So, I called them back in about 30 minutes and they finally picked up. 

I asked what time do they close. They said at 2:00 am. My heart started racing because I got excited. I ordered a combination rice on the phone. I just wanted to try it out. 

When I arrived I noticed the doors closed, the dining area clean with the chairs on top of the table and a sign that said we are closed. I was devastated! I really wanted to try it out and I was even more confused now. 

I was wondering why she told me they close at 2:00 am and why she took my order if it was closed! I was going to drive off, but I saw a man inside behind the counter. 

I got down and I noticed that the door was cracked opened. I opened the door and I saw some food orders in a to-go bag. When the man saw me he immediately said, &#34;combination rice to go?&#34;. I was like yes that is me. 

I was looking around and I couldn&#39;t understand. I asked the cashier what was going on. He smiled and he said, &#34;We close the dining area at 9:00 p.m, but we take to-go or delivery orders until 2:00 a.m.&#34;.

I felt a little dumb when he told me this. All this confusion for something so simple. First thing that came to my mind was that I had to let everyone know just in case there was someone like me. 

As I walked out they propped open one of the doors and a man took out a chair to sit in front of the restaurant. He was so nice. He wished me a good-night and thanked me for coming here. 

The cashier waved good-bye and thanked me as well. Even an employee leaving already said, &#34;bye thanks for coming&#34;. I felt so welcomed and glad I had come here. 

The combination rice was really good, but I only received one hot sauce and soy sauce. I expected it to be a little bigger, but they really did stuff the plate. 

Customer service was an A+ and the rice was an A. The only problem that I feel that needs to be resolved is the presentation after 9:00 p.m. 

They really need to display the hours and somehow explain that they are open only for take-out or delivery. Besides this little issue I loved it! I hope I get to come and sit in with my family soon."

I hate leftover food and balk at it. I ate their cold leftovers, people. I never ever do this. I still can&#39;t get over how great it was. So there you have it. 

Yes, I&#39;ve been to Thailand and ate both street food and gourmet restaurant and hotel chef food. Yes, I grew up in San Francisco eating really good Thai food. This was good stuff. Try it. We like their pad thai, panang beef, yellow curry chicken --although it is too spicy for our little kids when ordered mild. Will keep trying new dishes.

Calamari lacked flavor (salt, pepper, etc). I enjoyed the accompanying sauce however.
Spring rolls had a great crispy texture, but were mushy and weirdly sweet inside. 
The green curry was delicious but really hot for &#34;medium&#34; spiciest level.
The Thai iced was pretty good overall."

I came here on 3 separate occasions (2 times for takeout and once to eat in) and always had outstanding service and food. They were able to make our dishes without meat which is always a good sign for me. 

Last time I came in on a Friday night with my boyfriend (technically Saturday morning) and we ordered the medium spicy Pad Thai kee mao (like a Pad Thai but with thin glass noodles), medium spicy Tom Yum, and yellow curry. My boyfriend has a particular palate when it comes to his curry dishes. Instead of rice, he likes the flat, wide rice noodles (the pad see ew noodles) and usually has to special order that. They were happy to accommodate his request. 

The Pad Thai kee mao is my absolute favorite. I don&#39;t get regular Pad Thai anymore since I tried the kee mao style here (this would be my second time ordering it). The dish is slightly sweet with a kick, and had the delicate crunchiness of the vegetables and peanuts mixed throughout. 

The tom yum was about average, it got a little too spicy for me after it sat for a while. The standard hot and sour soup you can find anywhere. 

The yellow curry was delicious. I only had a small taste of it, but it packed a lot of flavor. 

Overall, I give this place 5 stars because nowhere else have I found quality Thai food open this late. The server were very attentive and helpful. I definitely will be back for their Pad Thai woon sen!"

Forgot an appetizer. Strike 2

So when this place first opened up, my fiance and I were a little skeptical. We live down the street and for the area, it seemed odd. But we&#39;ve now eaten there probably 6 or 7 times and it is definitely a solid Thai restaurant. 

At first glance, the picture wall menu of fast Chinese food might throw you for a loop, but I believe this is a part that they inherited and are working to get rid of? But they have an actual menu you can order off of with Thai dishes. 

Red curry is SO delicious. We love spice but ordered spicy twice and it was too hot for us (waw waw), so if you&#39;re sensitive, go mild or medium. Pad see ew is also great and both their tom yum and tom kha are spot on. Tonight they accidentally got my order wrong, but were so apologetic and comped my rice and gave us thai tea on the house. It was totally unexpected because we weren&#39;t upset, but the owner made sure we had a good experience.

I feel like they get a lot of complaints in the delivery department, but we&#39;ve ordered delivery twice without any hitches. It&#39;s a family owned business, they&#39;re super friendly, the food is great and we&#39;ll keep supporting them!"

My friend and I had their green curry and roasted duck curry, both of which were amazing.

The spiciness was definitely great just wish it was a softer texture because I would take a bite of the rice and chicken and have hard chili flakes causing a weird disturbance mid chews. Sometimes I had to spit them out. 

*Pad Thai w/ Chicken-
No complaints at all. Super delish and great amount. There&#39;s an option to add extra chicken for an additional price I would suggest this in the future I could have used a little more protein. Haha but I was content with what I had. 

There&#39;s a $3 delivery fee and you have to leave tip. For 2 items it was 23 without the tip. Pretty pricey but I was lazy."

We ordered a pad see ew with beef and a panang curry with beef. The beef was $1 extra for each entree. I called the restaurant twice asking to check up on my order. The cashier did not seem to know about the delivery orders and just threw out a ballpark time and hung up the phone. 

When the driver arrived, he called and simply said &#34;delivery outside&#34; and hung up the phone. The food itself was not worth the $25 I paid. The pad see ew had a sour taste and the serving was very small. I paid $1 extra for beef and there was barely any beef in my dish. The curry came without any rice and was extremely watery with little flavor. I will not be ordering from here again."

Menu seemed like it was going to be a good Taco Trip, Wrong. Service was good But, the food was bland and not enjoyable. Had a Lengua Taco, my favorite Taco choice in the whole wide world! And it was terrible! Tough,old flavorless (Lengua)meat and a dry hard tortillas. GUS&#39; How could you? Lengua should be tasty with hints of Laurel leaf and garlic salt and cumin, the spices you are supposed to add while cooking. It should have been DELICIOUS and it was not. When you take that first bite of a good Taco, it is likened to a kiss that rests on your lips and melts on your tongue. Not the experience found here. 

We also shared Al Pastor Fries. I don&#39;t know how many times the fries were &#34;Re- Fried&#34; Skinny, dry extra crispy fries that tasted like fish topped with a store bought, rough cut dry Al Pastor. Not even the &#34;Super Hot&#34;Salsa (not that hot, I&#39;ve had hotter)could cover up the nasty fry taste. That along with the stinky Cotija Cheese they top the &#34;Fish fries&#34; with- complete disaster. If you think it can&#39;t get any worse, the Horchata tasted like soap or cleaner-yuck! Probably a cheap  store bought concentrate.

Gus&#39; Lunch Box; Sorry, Not Sorry. When you ruin a Saturday night Taco Run this Bad, it has to be told. Pass on this Truck. Many a Taco I&#39;ve had, few have been this bad.

The carne asada in the taco was well cooked, and well spiced. The toppings and salsa on top was fresh. The tortilla was good. 

If you order out here, prepare to stand and eat. There are no seating. The little ledge on the food truck to hold food is bent so I wouldn&#39;t put food on that unless you like your food with a bit of LA streets. 

The price was a bit expensive for the food but it&#39;s a food truck. One is paying for the convenience.

I&#39;m giving Gus&#39;s 2 stars but I would give the restaurant 1 star and the truck 3 stars.
here&#39;s why...
the restaurant is dirty. the salsa bar only has pico de gallo and spicy veggies(carrots/onions) and lime.
i ordered all my food to-go. I ordered a veggie burrito for myself and a carne asada burrito for my buddy. when I got to my buddies house, we didn&#39;t have the guacamole I ordered, I ordered beans and rice on the side and they put them in a clam shell type styrofoam container so the bean juice is all over the bag all over the other items I ordered. should have put the beans in a container that seals shut. the burritos had no indication of which one was which so I had to open up one of the burritos to see which was my veggie burrito. the chips were stale and greasy. the salsa bar had no utensils and when I asked if I could get a serving spoon, the woman said to use the tongs from the limes. O_o
my friends carne asada burrito had a bone chunk in it. 
this place is mediocre in a city with great taco trucks. I actually feel they&#39;re slipping a little since each time I&#39;ve gone to the truck or the restaurant, it&#39;s a little less good."

Their tacos weren&#39;t anything to die for, but their Mulitas... my GAWD. Of the 8 years I&#39;ve lived in LA I&#39;ve never heard of them, but the Universe was on my side that night.

Be warned that their Super Hot Sauce is no joke.  I&#39;m pretty sure you should sign a waiver before consuming it, because it&#39;s a weapon.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, I like spicy, but this is just torture.  They should call it the &#34;F*** You Sauce.&#34; The trick, I found, is to mix it in with their regular salsa and bring the heat up to your liking.

My usual meal at this establishment is a lengua burrito, and if I am feeling hungry for some cheesy goodness, I would order their asada fries. This evening, I helped myself to a single lengua burrito. After waiting a meager five minutes, by burrito was ready for pick-up at the window.

I wasn&#39;t ready for the first bite. Even with all my years of experience eating Mexican cuisine, my body instantly became ravaged by the meaty thrust of the lengua burrito. A splooge of tender meat, soft rice, and warm beans was shot into my sensitive taste buds, and forced my body into a state of infinite ecstasy. I was trembling under the immense strain of so much pleasure, which is something that I have never experienced before--at least from a burrito.

After I finished the last bite, my butthole instantly puckered. What a roller coaster of flavor! I highly recommend getting the super spicy sauce to get the sweat going, and be sure to help yourself to the ample lime slices they have right next to the pick-up window."

Ordered Carne asada sopes, Carne asada tacos, chorizo tacos, and Carne asada burrito.  

Sopes were stacked high with toppings.  Fresh and flavorful.  Meat was hidden by toppings, but mingled well with toppings.

Carne asada tacos were ordered plain as they were for littles.  Meat lacked flavor, too much fat still on, and tortilla was lukewarm and over cooked.  Thumbs down here.

Burrito was small for price, but flavorful. 

Chorizo tacos were bit greasy, needed hot sauce to spice it up.

This is by far the WORST Mexican joint I&#39;ve been to. The only logical explanation for the high ratings is that people tried their food AFTER a night of drinking (read: heavy drinking). Because I definitely don&#39;t see how you enjoy it sober. 

Asada fries - Was their secret ingredient the essence of sweat? Because it was salty as fcuuuk. They also prepared it in those styrofoam plastic containers and nuked it to melt the cheese. Heart attack on a plate.

California burrito - Fat, flavorless, and bland. 

Asada taco - Tortilla was super soggy but the meat was alright. Nothing special.

I&#39;ve been to Gus&#39;s Lunchbox truck while it&#39;s parked in front of the Cha Cha Lounge late at night. I was elated to find that they had opened up a storefront.

Everything here is good. Whenever I have a feening for Carne Asada Fries, I fulfill them here.

Burritos are huge and can easily be shared. They don&#39;t fall apart as you eat them. There&#39;s usually one person behind the corner taking your order and then making it to order, so if you come when there&#39;s a crowd, it might be awhile till you get your order.

The super spicy is SERIOUSLY spicy. I&#39;ve busted out in tears eating it, and I have a pretty high tolerance for spice. My pro tip is to order half and half (i.e., if you&#39;re getting 3 tacos, do two super hot and one regular spicy, then mix &#39;em all together). I&#39;m sure they wouldn&#39;t mind combining salsas but I&#39;ve yet to ask.

PS - They accept card but I would recommend bringing cash. I don&#39;t have a problem with $1.50 tacos, but adding another dollar to that just to pay with my card would be my only real gripe.

Stumbled upon this fantastic little taco truck as I drunkenly stumbled out of Cha Cha&#39;s to call a cab.  Looked at the menu and I was instantly impressed by their selection of vegetarian options.  I asked the cashier (who later dubbed me 69 girl- I have no idea why) about it and he told me that they had a big selection of vegetarian/vegan options to cater to the  hipsters in SIlverlake. LOL he was a funny guy.

I went on to order a California burrito but because I&#39;m ridiculously picky I asked for extra beans, light rice, and absolutely NO cilantro and onions.  I went on to tell him that I&#39;m in law school and I would sue him and take the truck away from him if an onion touched my lips.  Before my burrito was wrapped, he called me over and had me inspect it to make sure there were no onions and cilantro.  NOW THAT&#39;S WHATSUP.  I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES I&#39;VE SAID NO ONIONS AND THEN BITTEN INTO A SH*T TON OF ONIONS.  I F***ING HATE ONIONS. 

10000000/10 for the customer service.

As to the burrito. It was easily the BEST burrito I&#39;ve had in +2 months.  This is a relaly big deal because I eat burritos 5+ times a week. They are, no joke, a food group for me.  The beans were not watery.  The carne asada was not fatty.  It was the size of my forearm.  It was DAMN DELICIOUS.  After eating my burrito, I went back to Cha Chas and that same cashier later saw me in there and came up and checked with me to see if the burrito was up to my standards.  1000000000/10 customer service.

I&#39;ve eaten here after long nights at cha cha lounge or The Red Lion. I&#39;ve had the Adana tacos, the asada torta and the asada burrito. 

The tacos are the best! The juicy meat and the simplicity of flavors the slight hint of lemon, the crunch of the onion and the freshness of the cilantro with a soft delicious tortilla these tacos were the BOMB! 5 Stars!

The torta is also really good. Lots of ingredients make it a little salty and hard to eat in its entirety. The bread is so soft and tender that it soaks in a bit of the saltiness from the beans and the asada and it was able to balance it out. The bread is absolutely amazingly delicious and i highly recommend the torta if you are hungry and need to be satisfied by something more substantial than a taco. 4 Stars for the Torta!

The Asada Burrito is just meh. Too salty too clunky and too one note. Not enough balance of flavors. 2 Stars for the burrito, not something i would ever order again.

Service was stellar. Friendly. Fast."

They stack your tacos with meat(not stingy at all), the salsa is so spicy but tolerable( at least for me). Once I tried the tacos they had my heart. Best Al Pastor and Asada tacos i have discovered.

Others can rave on about Tacos Delta or Mixto, but my heart is with Gus&#39;s. The joint is no frills and located in a kinda-ghetto strip mall near a freeway entrance. But who cares? The tacos are DELIGHTFUL. 

Asada, pollo, carnitas... doesn&#39;t really matter which meat you choose. They&#39;re all good. The meat is served on soft flour tortillas, topped with fresh onions and cilantro, and served with a side of salsa, wedge of lime and radish slices. Simple, clean ingredients resulting in a satisfying and dare I say it, refreshing meal. At $1.50 a pop, you really should try them all.

Second, the California burrito. Good lord, it&#39;s delicious. Fat? Duh. FAT DELICIOUS. It has just about everything in it: fries, cheese, meat, onions, cilantro, guacamole. I seriously cannot with some of these negative reviews. Y&#39;all need Jesus."

It&#39;s just middle of the road. I discovered how close this place was to work when I was on my way over to Starbucks for a sandwich and decided to just cut through the parking lot and hop over for a try. The prices are pretty fair for what it is.

There&#39;s nothing particularly interesting about the basics... rice, beans, etc. Not interesting, but not bad. And like other reviewers have said, the service is kind of bad. They seem to be understaffed. My salad came out after some other dude&#39;s cooked food... and he ordered AFTER me.

I also found their salsa to be unsettlingly salty. Who the hell makes salty salsa? These dudes.

But I guess I can&#39;t complain too much. For its price range, it was either this or Subway... I&#39;d rather have this."

I can&#39;t get enough of the mild sauce. The tacos were a bit dry the 2 times I got them (dry by the meat itself had no juice or strong flavor)  but honestly the fries make up for it.

I was not drunk though. I ordered the ambitious California burrito. IT was ginormous (and I think it was less than 8$). It was quite the experience.

I didnt know what it was but i took a bite and it was delicious. It was a tortilla, layered with meat, cheese, salsa, and more cheese to fuse a tortilla on op of it. 

He said, &#34;Bobin got it from Gus&#39;s lunch box.&#34; WTF is a Gus&#39;s lunch box?

later that week, i took a long nap after being awake for a couple of days (work), and i was starved...! I went straight for Gus&#39;s. As i got there, he turned of the Open sign, and damnnnnnn my stomach screamed F YOU!!!! LOL but he came out and says... &#34;What you want bro ill make it for you?&#34; 

Stomach screamed, &#34;Im sorrrrry THANK YOU!!!!!&#34;

so i ordered Carne Asada fries. 

I paid via Checkcard through his CC swipe on his iPad, and got my meal. It was good. I mean the portion was smaller than what im used to, but was really tasty.

I love grabbing a veggie burrito then taking it inside to Cha Cha Lounge and washing it down with an ice cold margarita. That&#39;s what I call an awesome dinner!

I love the Asada california burrito ( Burrito with french fries stuffed in it), The Asada fries, and the nachos. Definitely my go-to place when I want something filling! The ingredients aren&#39;t anything mysterious, but just the concoction of it is what keeps me going back for more. I can&#39;t do too much of it though, maybe once or twice a month or every other month but you guys must give this place a try.

Also, there is no missing out if you think it&#39;s too late and they must be closed because aside from their shop, they have their own food truck on Glendale blvd. which is parked across the street, open pretty late.

It just happens when you live in San Diego for so long. And when I moved to LA, I just hadn&#39;t been able to find quality late night Mexican food! Well, until I came here.

My friend from San Diego brought me here after a random Monday karaoke night at Big Foot Lodge. Even though she went to school in San Diego as well and I trust her judgement, I still had low expectations for this place.

I seriously gobbled that shit up. We ordered carne asada nachos and few tacos. I LOVED that it wasn&#39;t just some nacho cheese sprinkled with carne asada and other toppings. It was some  damn good melted Mexican cheese all over them chips. And their carne asada, al pastor and carnitas were well marinated and cooked. After we ate everything, I still wanted to go back and order more.

S had a beef quesadilla and got the spicy sauce which really wasn&#39;t as intense as I was fearing.

We sampled a few beers before deciding.  Ordered our drinks and two veggie appetiziers - the crispy brussell sprouts and the buffalo cauliflower.  Both fried but since they were vegetables, we felt like it was justified.  

Service was slightly slow but overall good.  The brussell sprouts were just the leaves - interesting but kept thinking you&#39;d get a stalk somewhere in there!  The cauliflower was deliciously fried.

Recommended by one of my friends, we visited on a Saturday night and went straight to ordering beers. I ordered the Super Girl which was both sweet and pretty strong (11.5% abv). Two or three of these will have you feeling really good. The Little Bear burger and the pastrami burger was ordered shortly after.

The Little Bear burger was delicious and was the best of the two burgers. The meat was flavorful and juicy from the truffle oil. I enjoyed both the mushrooms and crispy onions on the burger as well. The meat from the pastrami burger wasn&#39;t as juicy but was well seasoned. The slices of pastrami were great. My only gripe about this burger is the sauerkraut. The sauerkraut was a bit overpowering sometimes even outshining the flavors of both meats. This was easily resolved by raking some to the side. If this burger is ordered on a future visit, I&#39;ll ask for them to go easy on the sauerkraut or do no sauerkraut at all.

The fries were decent and came with a delicious aioli for dipping. I didn&#39;t find out what type of aioli it was but it did taste like garlic so it&#39;s safe to assume it was a garlic aioli. Service was great with our server maneuvering around me while trying to avoid getting in the way of my picture taking. It was pretty funny and we both laughed about it after.

When it comes to burgers within the Arts District, Umami has always been my go to. It&#39;s good to know there&#39;s another that I can count on for some good burgers.

I have been wanting to come to Little Bear in the Industrial District near DTLA for some time now.  I just never found a reason to be back in the area.  However, I recently stopped by this gastropub to grab a drink w/ my pal Van D before dinner on a Mon at nearby Bestia.  Little Bear is on Industrial right across the street from previously reviewed Church &amp; State.

I had some beers and a Hibiki 12 ($21 | 12 yr old Japanese whisky), while Van had a Dobb&#39;s cocktail ($12). In addition, while I was waiting for Van I had some Belgian fries ($7).

First of all, the Hibiki was excellent and came with a big block of ice as it should.  Japanese whiskies have a unique flavor, and are much smoother vs an American version.  Secondarily, Van really liked her cocktail also.  She was looking for something interesting, and the bartender did not steer her wrong.  The Tripel beers were refreshing early on a hot Spring evening, and the bartender comped me on one when he poured the wrong one.  Lastly, the fries were very good.  They were crispy and twice fried.  The only room for improvement would have been less shorter ones, so I could dip them more easily:  All 5 Stars.

The bartenders Pat and Kendra were as nice as can be, and Kendra was hawt!  Pat hails from Philly, and we had a conversation about how the Lakers and 76ers future are intertwined.  Philly was likely to get a Top 3 pick, but if the Lakers did not get a Top 3, the Lakers had to give their pick to Philly.  Mitch Kupchak is a fukn genius for doing that deal to get that worthless piece of $hit, Steve Nash.  I told Pat if the Lakers did not get to keep their pick, I would stop by on Wed:  Luckily for Pat, the Lakers got the #2 pick, and he&#39;s off on Wed.  But I would stop by anyway, just to talk to Kendra - LOL!:  5 Stars for both Pat &amp; Kendra.

I would enjoy returning to try the moules frites, wings, poutine, or a burger.  Based upon the Belgian fries, I&#39;m sure to like one of the foregoing items as much as Kendra!

Very cute decor. Servers aren&#39;t very nice. We were so hungry and wanted to order food quick since we all knew we wanted the burgers.

Ambience is industrial with (again!) those trendy light bulbs that have hit all the restaurants in the last two years.

We came early on a Monday, not a lot of people where. Service was surprisingly slow but we weren&#39;t in a rush so it was alright.

Their beer selection is GREAT and they have a huge list of sours (my fav!). And they have all the right glasses. WHOO.

Canadian mule cocktail was alright...

Ordered the poutine fries. It was filing and had a lot of short rib on it BUT it lacked that classic poutine flavor because they barely put any gravy on it, and the gravy was not thick. 

Little Bear burger was pretty good as far as expensive-ish burgers go (12)

Mussels came in a delicious sauce - wanted to drink that ish. Mussels themselves were alright.

Parking a little difficult but there&#39;s a lot that&#39;s 5 bucks, pretty decent for downtown.

Came here on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. It wasn&#39;t packed, got sat right away with our party of 9. Cool and airy space. 

The food was decent with higher than normal prices. I ended up ordering the steak and eggs medium rare. Not a lot of places do medium rare correctly, Little Bear does. My plate came with potatoes and sunny side up eggs. Unfortunately for me, there was nothing special about it. My fiancé ordered the grilled cheese short rib. I was excited to try it, but it was a let down. First off, where was the cheese? I expected an obnoxious amount of cheese, cause that&#39;s the only way to make grilled cheese. And second, the spare ribs were flavorless. I was disappointed. The only thing that picked me up were the crunchy fries and garlic aioli it was served with.

My other friends ordered burgers and said they were bomb. It is a gastropub, so it makes sense the best menu items are the burgers. 

I would come back again to try and redeem Little Bear, but for the burgers.

The food was way over priced. $18 for a burger and fries is fricking RIDICULOUS even by hipster LA standards. 
Quality of food was fine but really slow coming out. The restaurant was nearly empty and our two burgers took over a half hour.

We had a reservation for 3 at 7:00pm, and were seated very quickly when we arrived even though one person was still stuck in traffic (LA, ugh).  Seeing as how it was both Game 6 of the NBA Finals and the USA/Ecuador game of the Copa America, it was definitely a good thing we made a reservation, because the place quickly fliled.

- FOOD
Crispy Brussels Sprouts, split by 3 of us.  They were actually crisp, although more like Brussels sprouts chips because they were so flaky.  Not a bad thing, I was just expecting pan-fried halved sprouts or something.  The flavors of the balsamic and oregano came through, but the sprouts also tasted slightly burnt - maybe a hair too long in the oil/pan.  Hazelnuts added a nice, and different, crunch!

Little Bear Burger was SOLID.  I would order it again.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;m a huge fan of Stilton cheese, but the burger was delicious as a whole.  My medium rare burger actually still had some pink (some places overcook) and the wild mushrooms retained their distinction.  My friends split one, and half each was a good amount.  My only gripe is that the mixed greens were only lightly dressed with olive oil and maybe some salt - I don&#39;t love the taste of greens enough to just want to taste mixed greens...but I added some of the Brussels sprouts and that worked for me!

- MISC
Service was solid - we were checked on multiple times, but I never felt rushed, even as the pub filled.  Restrooms are single-person, and clean.  The overall feel of the place is good, with lots of windows for natural light and neat decor and artwork everywhere.  3 of the 4 TVs featured the Warriors&#39; loss while the other showed the USA&#39;s Copa America win.

The bar tender took about 5 min to come around. When she came around she didn&#39;t greet us only asked what we wanted to drink. 
Observing around we weren&#39;t the only ones getting bad service. 
Later, an individual who was behind the bar polishing glasses burped extra loud right in front of us like it was okay.
Is this what we have gotten to?

Honestly, I knew nothing about this place but decided to go here because my dog&#39;s name is also Little Bear. I had a friend visiting from NY, and was staying in Monterey Park, so driving here wasn&#39;t that bad at all! We came at an off time for lunch, around 2 on a sunday, and sat ourselves at a big table in the corner, just the two of us. It was nice and spacious, and we liked the atmosphere.

I had the Little Bear burger (of course) and it was amazing. I ordered medium, and it came out not as pink as I was expecting, but it was sooo juicy and flavorful. Loved the mushrooms too. I am the biggest burger snob, but this burger is now on the top of 5 of my life. Unfortunately, I had cut it in half so my friend and I could swap. Fortunately, she had ordered the short rib grilled cheese, and that was pretty darn good too. There was a generous amount of tender short rib. Was not disappointed in the food. I also enjoyed whatever the sour beer was on the menu, and my friend, the sparking wine. We had a great time! Service was excellent as well. Definitely want to come back and try the brunch menu (or maybe get the burger again)."

Of course, I ended up with an old fashioned and not beer but for all you beer drinkers, this place is awesome.

Everyone ordered food but I had just come from somewhere else so I just stole a few bites of the brussels sprouts, which were pretty amazing. I could see this place as a fun hang out after work. Maybe not so much on a dinner/weekend destination unless you&#39;re just looking to chill."

GET THE BRUSSEL SPROUTS. I have no idea how they make them, but they were so good.

I&#39;m super descriptive and helpful on this one, I know. Ahaha. But seriously, so good. Get them.

Not to mention our server was a sweetheart and let us sample some of the craft brews to make sure we knew what we wanted.. But, if you aren&#39;t a beer freak like myself, there is also PLENTY of liquor and craft cocktails for you to chose from! 

    The food was absolutely incredible as well, my best friend and I shared three appetizers, the Brussel sprouts, which were amazing, they flake the Brussel leaves, and then cook them, so they are crispy, mix them with peanuts and Parmesan cheese and something a tad spicy. We also shared the Mac n Cheese, it was a skillet Mac, super cheesy, and rich, the Gruyere cheese is a perfect touch. And lastly we shared the poutine fries.. OH. MY. GOSH. Talk about to absolutely die for... Fresh fries slathered in homemade gravy, cheese curds and meat. DELICIOUS. These are a MUST TRY. 

      Over all, we had a great experience, the ambience is great, very industrial, yet really intimate, if you&#39;re coming on a weekend night, I would highly suggest making reservations, as the location isn&#39;t huge, but mid day, we had no problem!!"

I have been here before and had high hopes I would enjoy this visit more since the first time was a snooze fest.I feel like there is never more than 10 people in this bar at a time.. Maybe it&#39;s the area or maybe it&#39;s just not fun. Beers seem over priced and the selection seems to cater to a crowd that likes to pay 20+ for a sour. I am not that patron. They do offer a Pilsner and whiskey shot combo for 10 bucks but I&#39;ve seen that done for way cheaper at other bars. Let&#39;s be realistic here if I&#39;m being accosted by bums from skid row out front why the hell is everything so expensive here? The plus would be they had tv&#39;s seeing as we came from a place without one this impacts my review and maybe the only reason I gave two stars. Skip it. Go to 82 for a fun and interactive evening.

Service has always been spotty but the food usually justified the visit.  Our group arrived at 2:50 where we were met by a staff member who apologized and explained brunch ends at 3:00. The kitchen reopens for dinner at 4:00. He said we were welcome to hang out and have a drink til then. We understood and killed time at a near by wine bar.

When we returned at 4:00 and after we were seated our waitress told us the kitchen would remain closed for another 30-60 minutes because they had a &#34;food photoshoot!&#34;

WTF! Why were not advised of this before hand? I am certain the little bear was aware of the food shoot. Why didnt they share this with their patrons beforehand.  What a joke."

The decorations were fairly plain but had so much charm my man and I were amazed how they could make something as common as rope to create a fabulous ceiling piece of art. 
The bartender was awesome. I can&#39;t remember her name but she said she was from New York and she was extra helpful. If it wasn&#39;t for her I definitely wouldn&#39;t have given a full 5 stars.

Little Bear is a great little restaurant, the perfect mix of a Belgian beer pub and a hip, artsy, repurposed restaurant. As a DTLA resident I&#39;ve learned that many of the best brunch and coffee places are in the Arts District, and Little Bear is no exception. 

My friends and I recently stopped by for brunch and really could not have had a better experience. Even though it was a Saturday at 11:30 we were seated immediately, and were all quite smitten with the decor. We lucked out in that we could have ordered from either the brunch or lunch menu, and there were plenty of options - several benedicts, scrambles, liege waffles, and breakfast sandwiches. I ended up with the egg/bacon/gruyere sandwich + fries and my friends got the smoked salmon scramble + potatoes and the chicken and waffle. Everything was really tasty and the portions were large - we definitely left full! I thought the sandwich and fries were a bit greasy, but honestly after a night out on the town, that&#39;s exactly what I needed the next morning. I think my one complaint is that regular coffee costs $4, but you do get unlimited refills. 

Our waitress did end up getting a little busy, but we didn&#39;t mind since she was very sweet and we wanted to sit and talk for awhile anyways.  

A bonus is that there&#39;s plenty of free street parking outside, and if you visit here on a lazy weekend day you can walk around the area for a bit and enjoy the cool architecture and street art of the Arts District. We will definitely be back!"

We came here on a Sunday for brunch and it wasn&#39;t crowded at all. 4 parties/tables tops. We also got really lucky with street parking.

Between two, we ordered the Fire Belly Scramble and the Steak and Eggs. Both entrées took more than 25 minutes to come out. The Fire Belly Scramble was scrumptious but it made me realized I&#39;m not much of a fan of chicken sausage. When the Steak and Eggs came out, our hostess realized the eggs weren&#39;t sunny side up so she said she&#39;d get the kitchen to bring out another side of it. The extra eggs didn&#39;t show up for another 15 minutes. The Steak and Eggs was delicious though--I have to give Little Bear that much. The steak was cooked just right and seasoned perfectly. 

I&#39;d love to come back and give the place another shot but I definitely wouldn&#39;t risk coming back when I&#39;m starving because the food took a ridiculous amount of time to prep and bring out."

Huge selection of Belgian Beer and a menu of familiar comfort food with a Belgian twist. Came here with a big group to celebrate my best friend&#39;s 30th bday. I loved the industrial decor with the wooden tables, exposed beams, ductwork and hanging ropes. It&#39;s not very big, so make a reservation to guarantee table. 

They only have 1 burger in their menu and it&#39;s amazing!

Their not so little &#34;LITTLE BEAR BURGER&#34; $15 is a must try. Freshly ground Angus patty with sauteed wild mushrooms, blue cheese, a lil bit of arugula, super crispy breaded and fried onions and some kind of sweet and tart sauce. I asked our server and she said it has cherry gastrique and white truffle oil. The meat is so moist. The combination of flavors and texture are so complex. I told myself I was only gonna eat half and save the other half for El Hubby, but I couldn&#39;t stop myself after one bite. It&#39;s absolutely delicious! 

I also tried their PORK BELLY SLIDERS for appetizer. Thick pork belly fat doused in some kind of sweet sauce. It&#39;s like pork candy. My friends had their FISH and CHIPS, FRIED BRUSSEL SPROUTS and SHORT RIB SANDWICH and  their beer (I don&#39;t remember the names) they all really liked them.

From the adorable name, to the red door, to the romantic candle lighting. The customer service was great, our waitress was quick, attentive and friendly! 

I ordered the Little Bear burger with truffle fries (I was spoiling myself!) and it was soo good. In fact, the fries might have been too good - I might have been better off with a salad. If you&#39;re into buttery, deep fried fries, definitely order that. 

The tuna burger, on the other hand, was just a tuna sandwich in disguise... I think we were expecting a tuna patty, but it was like they opened a can of tuna and shaped it like a patty - so, of course, it looks good until you pick it up and it falls apart on you. Also, I think they should give you a warning about the squid ink bun it comes in... When you&#39;re not expecting it, a black buns (lol) are quite the surprise. 

Their beers seemed interesting and yummy, so I was a little disappointed in not trying them, but I know that if I return here, I&#39;d plan to check out their bar!

Bottom line the food is subpar and even though we were the only people in the restaurant it took at least 20-30min to come out. 

My wife got a salad with chicken. It was underdressed and the chicken looked like rubber strips.  

I got chicken and waffles. The waffles we pretty hard and the chicken was 3 small sad strips.  I don&#39;t know why it took half an hour to get to us. There were more fried onion strings on the dish than chicken or waffles. The whole thing was painfully sweet. Overall just not good. But edible.

We started with the Short Rib Poutine. The Belgian fries come topped with ale braised angus beef, mozzarella, L.B. gravy and parsley. That is a great list of ingredients. The flavors combined are ok. It is hearty, filling food. I would have liked a little more distinct flavor, but it was solid.

Next we tried the short rib grilled cheese. It comes filled with ale braised angus, smoked mozzarella, wild arugula and crispy onion. It was certainly filling and had good flavors. The onion gave it more texture too."

Of which we ordered both, but never received. When we got our food we received the burgers but no wings. We told our waitress/bartender but she proceeded to deny that we ever ordered wings. We did. We had four people dining and only two burgers were served. After she aggressively insisted that we were wrong, she proceeded to absolutely disappear from the restaurant. We never saw her again and it seemed as if she had snuck out of the restaurant. This was on November 21, 2016 at 945pm. So whoever was working must know who she is. On the other hand there was a very nice bearded man wearing a baseball cap who has been nice to us in the past, who was again our savior. He&#39;s helped us before and he&#39;s always been very positive. He comped a drink or two for her bad attitude. This place is good, but the service is amateur (besides the bearded bartender). They need to hire people who know how to wait."

Little Bear is definitely one of them. Although their prices seem a little high for me, I am still a fan. I definitely can&#39;t eat here for lunch everyday because it ranges from $17-$25 a head after tax and tip. 

They recently just got a new chef so some of their original menu items have changed. I tried the Tuna Burger with Squid Ink Buns &amp; a side of mixed greens ($17). The burger came on BLACK BUNS that were perfectly soft and squishy. I couldn&#39;t really taste the squid ink, but it was a great bun regardless. The tuna patty was a little on the dry side for me. I wish I could have opted for medium rare, but that was not offered. Aside from the tuna being dry, the flavors of the burger married so perfectly together-- WASABI AOLI (ask for some extra on the side) + some sort of sweet soy glaze + sake mirin glazed hijiki  + toasted sesame. It was such a unique burger. The hijiki was my favorite part of the burger!

They also have REALLY SOLID tomato soup + grilled cheese. Such a simple dish but full of hearty and familial flavors."

Remember this nursery rhyme? If you do, I bet you&#39;ll have a fun time singing this song while buzzed and doing the movements!!! Any who.... Lets get down to bisnazz!

Rating: 3 1/2 stars for now....

Parking/location: Plenty of street parking at night, but it&#39;s a bit sketch. Make sure you bring your own cape crusader if you can. Located on Mateo St. and Industrial. This gastropub is across the street from Church and State bar.

Decor/ambiance: From the outside, the light lighting at night drew me to this place and the decor modern. The place is dim and to set the mood they have a candle lit..... Ooooh laaaaa laaaaa... how romantic! Good for bromancing, sismancing, couples, friends that you secretly like, and spending time with good friends. It can be loud here. 

Service was a bit slow, but the server tried his best. The place seemed a bit understaffed tonight.

Cost: I thought the price of the burger was not worth $15 dollars, I guess you are paying more for the experience/ambiance.

Food: Had the Little Bear burger (mushrooms, cheese, angus beef, caramelized onions which was served either with belgium fries or a small salad). I chose the belgium fries that came with a side of aioli sauce and ketchup. Loved the burger! It was packed with a lot of flavor with every bite.

Beer: Come here for belgium beeeer! 

Will be backkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk for s&#39;moreeeeeeeeee!!!!!!"

We came for a friend&#39;s 40th birthday, and after waiting over 2 hours for food to arrive after being seated, we still have people at the table who didn&#39;t get their food yet. Nearly everyone&#39;s order has been incorrect - either served at the wrong meat temperature, or simply arrived cold, but were too hungry to bother sending it back (or worried what the kitchen would do to it if they did). It took over an hour for coffee to arrive at the table, and even then they didn&#39;t deliver it to everyone that ordered it. Two of the people in our party had to leave without eating because they had an appointment afterwards, without even an apology from the waitress.  We&#39;re currently bussing our own tables and removing the used dishes and silverware because the restaurant is so understaffed and incompetent. And let me emphasize that at no point during this entire ordeal has a manager been to see our table, even once.  Horrendous."

My gfs and I met here for some beer and appetizers on a Friday night around 8:30pm.  There was no wait, but parking was a little tight due to an art gallery event nearby.  I literally ran from my car to the restaurant because I was a little scardy-cat walking 3 dark blocks by homeless people and creepy shadows.  There is paid parking if you can&#39;t find a good spot but I refused to pay that night.  Risk my life vs. pay for parking, a daily struggle.  

There is plenty of space inside which is great.  We had no problems getting a table.  The menu itself is varied but for some reason nothing on the entree list appealed to us... only the appetizers.  I would recommend sharing a bunch of yummy appetizers if you can&#39;t settle on an entree.  

We had:
- Mac and cheese: always a must, the bread crumbs on top are delish
- Crispy brussel sprouts: I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect but it is such a novelty we had to try it.  It was delicious!!!  The balsamic, oregano, and rosemary all create a very fragrant chip like appetizer.  The leaves are all peeled rather than having chunks of brussel sprouts fried.  Delicate goodness.
- Braised short rib poutine: savory and tasty
- Jidori chicken wings: pretty large wings if you ask me.  Very good, ours were a little undercooked towards the bones on some.

We drank: 
- Pumpkin something? with 18% alcohol: a very small portion but very potent
- Peach beer (Peche Mel): the best out of all of them
- Some other light beer that tasted almost like beer pong beer sadly

Overall a good dining experience, just not sure if I would make the trek out from WLA for this place alone.  But you must get the crispy brussel sprouts!"

The burger was super small with an extra large bun. Overcooked not medium as asked but more like a hockey puck. The short rib poutine was good but to share with a party of 5 for an app had only 3 slices of short ribs and barely any gravy. The hangar steak was good but they sliced it for you...so strange. Brussel sprouts were the saving grace. 

The service: not good. We had a girl not sure her name but it was a Saturday night and there were only like 5 tables full. we were party of 5. The appetizers came and we asked for serving utensils. The apps were getting cold so we just dug in while we waited and waited.  They eventually came.  All the entrees came out at different times. We ordered two steaks medium rare. They brought 2 medium and one well done.  The burger canned out last.  We ordered dessert and wanted coffee but never got a chance to ask.  No server.  What a surprise.  At the end we asked for the check.  The server gladly dropped it off.  We tried to make it easy to run 3 cards. When we got our individual checks to sign we figured out that gratuity was included on our tab.  I didn&#39;t want to cause a scene so I asked the server why this was included.  She first said that because we were a large party, then that because our check was over 100$, and also didn&#39;t tell us...mind you I was out with 4 Italians two of which lived here and 2 on vacation and myself. You make your own conclusion about why she included a gratuity on our check."

The plates came out one at a time (every ten minutes) cold and undercooked and a simple cup of coffee took 35 minutes to arrive. The place was empty when we arrived and yet the kitchen was still incapable of putting a decent plate of food together.

At one point my friends and I debated carrying plates back to the kitchen to help a staff that was so clearly underprepared in acting like a restaurant.

I could see a revisit one Friday night where we just kind of make our way to all three throughout the course of the night. It&#39;s like the booze triangle. 

The inside of Little Bear is impressive. Industrial meets cozy pub. Belgian beer styles only here. We are usually IPA fans so we braced ourselves upon arrival. The beers range from 6-9. I think we had a pils that was 7 a pint. Be careful if you&#39;re headed their to drink. It will add up. The Little Bear burger and Belgian fries was on the more expensive side, $15, but I can&#39;t complain about the quality. Stilton cheese, wild mushrooms, and crispy onions topped onto a perfectly medium rare cooked patty. We asked for the cherry gastrique on the side because the sound of it made me think it would ruin the burger. Not so. It was awesome and I dunked every bite of my burger in it. Mopped up the bottom of the condiment with my fries for good measure. 

Waitress was sweet and checked on us regularly. Whether you&#39;re at the bar, communal tables, or at a high top, you&#39;re sure to have a good time. Parking was a bit of a nightmare. We were their for lunch on a Saturday so it may be different at night."

Service was good for lunch hour. On point with refills and such with an honest opinion on the menu items which I appreciate.

He also added that his cranky and sad female bartender coworker (the one that sometimes wear glasses with brunette/blonde highlights) refuses to serve us because of the same reason. Obviously, they were rude and unprofessional. For someone who was a regular customer who actually tipped more than what they deserved, that was a horrible experience.

----------------
After my first bite, I was made an instant fan of the Toffee Crunch Waffle (served with caramel sauce, whipped cream, and shaved chocolate). I felt $9 was not an unreasonable price for this treat, given the palatability, aesthetically pleasing presentation, and portion size. Whether as a dessert or just a snack, you can&#39;t go wrong with this menu item.

The service I received varied amongst my 3 servers - the one who took first place was Kayla, not because she was easy on the eyes (even though she was, *and then some*), but because she provided the most exemplary service (with a smile, no less) - she attentively kept my drink topped off, her manners were splendid, her demeanor most agreeable, and she was very good about not bringing me the check until I requested it.

The restroom was more spartan than one might expect from this type of business, but it was conspicuously clean and hygienic.


THE BAD
-------------
The late Jeff Cooper once noted that something can be said to be overpriced if you could get the same exact thing (or better) elsewhere for less money.

On that note, the Little Bear Burger and Belgian fries were not bad, but I felt the plate was well overpriced at $15. I can definitely say that I&#39;ve had more appetizing burgers and fries (of comparable portion size) elsewhere for less money.

So while I would be open to coming back to Little Bear, I would never again order one of their burgers.


THE UGLY
---------------
Parking availability in the area can be pretty iffy if you come during a busier night/hour ... you may not be as lucky as I was to get a free spot on the curb, and may have to settle for one of the paid parking lots nearby.

The interior/ambiance is ridiculously noisy, due to both the patrons and background music. Keep in mind that I came during a slow afternoon hour on a mid-weekday, when occupancy was at maybe 15- 20% *tops*. I can only imagine how insanely loud this place at full occupancy on a Friday or Saturday night ...

The wooden seats/benches were palpably uncomfortable, and this alone ensured that I could not award this establishment 5/5 stars ... my painfully sore and furiously displeased asscheeks would never allow it."

Parking sucks but if you&#39;re an L.A. Native that&#39;s expected so for me it&#39;s not a big deal to find out there will be a fee to pay. 

As you walk through what seems to be an attempt at restoring a once forgotten and abandoned area, you&#39;ll find yourself immersed in a strange mix between business and casual. You&#39;ll probably be met with a diverse group of individuals as you approach their red door.

As you walk in (watch your step) take the time to look around. I went at night, so the environment was dimly lit but it set the mood right. We were greeted by a pleasant hostess who sat us down at our table of choice (not sure if it&#39;s the norm but it was very empty for a Thursday night). After looking through the menu we had made our decisions. And so begins the tale of the food.

First,as per usual, I ordered a drink of water. I would not say that I&#39;m a water snob (if there is a such a thing) but it was not to my liking. It was just water sitting in a pitcher ready to be poured. Room temperature, and tasted old. They had a nice little candle the illuminated the table which provided enough light to look at the menu. Now, I understand that I&#39;m at a Gastropub so perhaps water isn&#39;t their forte (I doubt it&#39;s anyone&#39;s forte for that matter). And I went to order something on their menu that was... Well let&#39;s say different. I ordered their Tuna Burger.

The Tuna Burger arrived not too long after with a side of vegetables (they also give you the option to get fries but I don&#39;t usually eat or order fries but I did try that night). So where do I begin? Well don&#39;t be surprised by the bread.. It&#39;s black. And for those of you who have never had one, give it a shot. It&#39;s not a Halloween hoax, it&#39;s actually the composition of the ingredients. Here&#39;s where everything went awry... The actual meat itself was not that good. It started off with a nice consistency and flavor but after the third bite I was over it.It did not retain td consistency whatsoever, and the taste was just bland. Luckily, the salad was there to save the day but in all honesty, I wouldn&#39;t pay what I paid for such a bland meal. It lacked real flavor. Much of the flavor was locked into the very center of the burger, with no extra sauces to add to it. Needless to say I was disappointed in the food. I did not try the beers which I will for the sake of this review assume are better than the food. But as they say assumptions is the mother of all f&amp;@$ ups. I did have a chance to try the little bear and the fries as aforementioned, and while it was a noticeable difference in the overall taste, I wouldn&#39;t come here again for their food. Sadly, as much as I want to like this place and give them a higher rating, mediocrity is rewarded as such. Maybe I&#39;ll return one day, but it won&#39;t bet for their food. I do however think that the ambiance is just right. The magic is somewhere past those two red doors, it just wasn&#39;t there that night."

I have eaten breakfast/brunch here a million times at this point ... and am just realizing that I haven&#39;t yet ventured over for dinner.  But trust me when I say that brunch NEVER disappoints.  It&#39;s got a laid back vibe and great beer.  AMAZING waffle burger ... (the waffle here has almost a creme brûlée texture to the outer layer) and basically a nice satisfying menu.  There is something for everyone.  Scrambles to carbs ... your pick.  But honestly, if you forgo the waffle, I think something is wrong with you!

I enjoy the brunch here so much that I chose it as the location for an engagement brunch this past weekend.  Not only were they very accommodating and gracious ... but the group brunch went off without a hitch.  They had a big table set up for us and ready to go.  I&#39;m an eternal fan."

Had the fish and chips and the short rib grilled cheese.  Fish tasted very fresh and not too heavy.  Grilled cheese had the perfect cheese to short rib ratio. 

And our service was amazing.  Had a really knowledgeable and friendly waitress who was actually from Belgium!  

We will be back soon!"

The selection of beers was all right, not too many dark ones when I came, although I would recommend the Monk&#39;s blood, I believe it&#39;s a dark red ale, a little bit on the sweeter side but def worth trying. The one thing that killed it for me was glasses of beer smelled awful. Everyone in my group had a smelly glass and it smelled exactly like a dirty rag which worries me. I would come back here to give it another shot but hopefully next time it will be different."

I used to come here all the time since I worked close by. Tonight I brought some friends and we were all very disappointed. I was very embarrassed!! We ordered the Brussels sprouts and they were burnt, I told the waitress and they said they would give a couple dollars off the dish. It was terrible, I used to order it all the time. I then ordered a pastrami which in the past melted in your mouth. Not even close to before. To top it off, I asked for mustard and they said they don&#39;t carry mustard. Unbelievable!!! My friend ordered kettle one vodka and they said they don&#39;t carry it. I asked for grey goose vodka and once again they said they didn&#39;t carry that either. We will not be coming back here again. 

I&#39;d like to update my message. The manager Joshua contacted me to apologize and speak to the cook and the other employees. He was very professional and I really appreciate and trust it was a bad night. In the past I loved this place and I&#39;m sure Joshua will fix the issues. This was one of my favorite places in the past and look I toward to going back."

FOOD:
-Farro burger (vegan)- I subbed the whole wheat bun for the brioche bun because I love brioche and I&#39;m not vegan but I was disappointed in the brioche bread! Dry and bland, I ended up not eating it and just ate the burger part, which was okay.
- Brussels sprouts - these were prepared with just the leaves and I prefer when the sprouts are halved and roasted. So they were okay, just not as good as I was hoping :(

I didn&#39;t try any of my friends&#39; food BUT Little Bear fries their fries in beef fat so if you don&#39;t eat beef (like me) or meat at all, don&#39;t get their fries!

SERVICE:
Can&#39;t complain. Place wasn&#39;t crowded, our server was friendly and food came out in a timely fashion. It was a little difficult to flag down our server at times and there were definitely 2 instances where something was dropped and shattered.

VENUE:
Gorgeous! High ceiling, with rope and cool light bulbs. Rustic farm tables and metal café chairs. Very cool. Bathrooms are single stall per gender, boo.

PARKING:
Plenty of street parking around if you&#39;re willing to go a little further. There are also paid lots nearby.

I should have looked at Little Bear&#39;s menu a little more because I don&#39;t eat or can&#39;t eat about 85% of the menu... and I don&#39;t prefer to drink Belgian beer... I was obviously a little confused when I bookmarked this place hahaha. Really pretty venue though!"

I took the little bro here to try the little bear burger and he was pleased with it as well. Service was on point and the place was moderarely busy for an early evening. I went and ordered the little bear burger and it was as good as I remembered it. I don&#39;t know why I even compared this burger to a fathers office burger in terms of taste.... I was completely wrong in that sense- although I&#39;d take one of these over a FO burger any day.

Food
Short rib poutine. Gravy wasn&#39;t as thick as I expected. Huge portion enough to share

Mac and cheese - small portion but rich and tasty with their variety of cheeses 

Ahi burger - the server said they cook it so it&#39;s pink and on the rare side but when it came it was quite well done. I didn&#39;t care for it and barely finished even after I split it 

Overall food is good. Service was a bit lacking."

I upped a star on this review because the food is MUCH better, the wait staff has always impressed me and we love having a brunch spot close to home in DTLA that has easy parking.

However... This is to management - Every time we come for brunch, there is only one waitstaff person on the floor to handle ALL tables.  We soon realized if we had sat at the bar we would have gotten prompt service.  The bartender has a finite number of people to wait on. While... this one girl with pink hair was running around killing herself trying to wait on two 8-10 top tables and 8 more 2-4 tops.  

If you try to cut costs by understaffing your restaurant, you will pay for it in the long run.  My bf was ready to leave after 20 minutes and just menus in front of us. The waitress did come by to explain she was quite busy and would be right back.  BF was still ready to go somewhere else.  I explained to him that people were being served at the bar before we even placed an order because she was handling the entire restaurant.  

As soon as our waitress was able to get to us, her service was impeccable.  I would have given 5 stars if the place was staffed well. Our food was delicious and on fleek, the addition of the rope decor has quieted the room down considerably, and our pink-coiffed waitress handled a bad situation with class and efficiency.  

Hire one more person for Sunday brunch is all I am sayin&#39;."

I think they are known for their variety of panna cottas and their gourmet brownies. 

The non-cheese cake type panna cottas are quite light and refreshing. A couple of the cheese cakes I tried were generally good but not my cup of tea. The group&#39;s favorite seemed to be the chocolate salted caramel and the coffee caramel. The raspberry is a plain panna cotta with a raspberry liquid on top. The cheese cakes each has a base crust the is made of cashew and almond. 

The gourmet brownies are made with almond flour. I&#39;m not sure I like the slight griddy texture and it&#39;s on the dry side.

The coconut macaroons are delicious. My wife who does not like coconut actually liked it."

I ordered Tom Yum Noodle soup TO GO and showed them a picture from their Yelp page of what I wanted. The order finally arrived with big flat noodles. I requested thin noodles. They refused to accommodate me. Claiming that they already boiled the noodle. Then she had the nerve to say I didn&#39;t request thin noodles. I told them I already showed them the picture exactly what I wanted and they originally acknowledged it. 

Instead of admitting to their mistake, they refuse to correct it and made all kinds of excuses. Other Thai restaurants I encountered had no problem remaking the dish, offered you a discount, making exchanges, etc to keep your business. Noodle sticks do not cost that much, trust me, they only cost less than a buck at the Asian store.

The 3 Waitress looked at each other and spoke in their language then they all walked away ignoring me and left me standing there. It&#39;s 11pm, they are often busy on the weekend with people in which they can use it for other dishes, it&#39;s untouched. 

I don&#39;t see why they can&#39;t exchange my big flat noodles with thin noodles even though the big flat noodles was not in a broth. Bad business. Do they realize that there are hundreds of Thai restaurant around the corner and that they will lose more Customers if they continue to be cheap?

I order 3 different dishes total of $30, but they couldn&#39;t even exchange to thin noodles. Wow, this place rather lose a customer over a 50 cent noodles."

I reviewed this particular restaurant on Facebook and was harassed moments later , they said it was the wrong restaurant despite being the same franchise I believe , I deleted my review . Was harassed on my Facebook messenger by this weird lady who said 

&#34; take it off &#34;
&#34; idiottt &#34;
&#34; okay sorry bye &#34; 

And that pissed me off to be harassed on my personal Facebook rather the comments section in the review itself on their page . 

I wrote an even fatter 1 star and talked about the harassment .

Later this fake attorney who could not speak English whatsoever said that this &#34; association &#34; would take action if I did not remove incorrect review lol . 

Listen to me motherfucker , in America I can review what I want and say what I want about any restaurant without consequences because freedom of speech is on the constitution . This is not Thailand sorry , your laws do not apply to me Prak BoonAttorney , and threatening a lawsuit against someone with a great lawyer and great money around isn&#39;t smart because I can sue for harassment and possibly endangerment being under 18 and having these grown bastards harass me due to me letting Los Angeles know before hand that this place (or franchise) is filthy and has roaches . (: so enjoy your fat 1 star review .

 I hope whoever reads this does not come spend your money here . There&#39;s way better and cleaner Thai places in Los Angeles ."

I recently tried One of my favorite Thai dishes here--roasted duck noodle soup-- and I was not disappointed. Huge portion, delicious, tons of meat for about $10. Took only about 10 minutes for a to go order on a Thursday night at 10pm. According to their menu they specialize in Thai noodles and I can definitely agree they do a great job on them.

Within days of my first time visit, I returned with friends and tried the pad see ew and green curry. The curry is by default pretty spicy for my palate but my friends loved it. I also liked their pad Thai although it is on the sweet side, not as good as Grand Central Market&#39;s Sticky Rice which is my favorite pad Thai in LA to date.

Service is a bit slow, we waited for eons for our other three dishes after my friend got hers, but the place was packed late at night. In fact this place is always packed late at night.

For late night food options this place is great."

That is a long-ass time. I consistently get good food! Low prices (cash only), good food and decent portions. 

This Hollywood location is smaller than their North Hollywood one. Parking is a pain but you have a gentleman helping navigate you to park or will park your car. Otherwise, you would have to drive around in hopes to find street parking. 

It&#39;s a no frills ambiance. You are just there to grub and go. Staff has always been friendly to me but they can get pretty busy so be patient. 

Of the top of my head, my favorite are:
- beef pad see ew
- duck noodles
- duck salad
- garlic beef or chicken topped with a fried egg ( you have to ask for the fried egg)
- crab fried rice
- the Hainan chicken (it looks plain but trust me, it&#39;s flavorful. just not as intense as the darker sauce dishes)


The only reason I don&#39;t come here regularly is the parking. But being that it has been several years since I have been coming here and left happy, I truly recommend this little gem."

The first thing my wife noticed as we pulled into the parking lot, &#34;Cash Only&#34; posted boldly on the door. But there is an ATM right next to their outdoor seating. Stepping inside, my first impression was &#34;plenty of tables but way outdated&#34;. We were greeted immediately and allowed to choose our own seats. And needing time to scan the menu, we finally decided on the Chicken Pud-See-Ewe and Assorted Vegetables Over Rice with added Chicken. I also ordered the Thai Tea, while my wife only wanted water. That was until she sampled mine and enjoyed it! She has an extreme sensitivity to sweets and some Thai Teas fell into that category. But this Thai Tea was right on point with her.

The food took probably 20 minutes and it was obviously prepared to order. Not over or under seasoned. I believe like true Chinese food, not Americanized, this Thai is more like the real thing. But we enjoyed it and wouldn&#39;t mind a return visit to sample more menu items."

I love the 50&#39;s diner vibes with the big booths and neon signs. Separate vegetarian section of the menu-everything is vegan if you ask for no egg. Prices here are a bit higher than many of their local competitors, and the portions are average sized. 

I went with the vegetarian fried noodle with tofu. Delicious flat noodles with broccoli rabe, mushrooms, and tofu. I enjoyed the flavors of my dish, but found it to be much too oily. The tofu was perfectly seasoned, but overcooked and difficult to chew. Still a well above average meal, but certainly not the best I have had in Thai Town. I plan to return and try something a bit more simple next time-the curries look incredible!

Service was very friendly and quite fast. They do not serve alcohol. Cash only!"

Well, mostly around Hollywood. Still, it&#39;s a must try! Where I&#39;m from, to get a decent Thai dish such as pad Thai, pad see ew and tom kha kai is a hit and miss. It&#39;s gets frustrating when you really want something good! I&#39;ve always known that wherever you go in LA, you&#39;ll be blessed with good food. Now, you Los Angelenos may contest but you&#39;ve got to compare local Las Vegas food first before you do that. 

Anyway, this spot doesn&#39;t have the best ambiance but the food speaks for itself. Tom kha kai was delicious with lemongrass, coconut milk and pepper working in perfect harmony. My favorite about this soup is the use of mushrooms. It cringe at the thought that some restaurants would serve this with button mushroom! This is best enjoyed with straw mushrooms as it easily absorbs the soup.

The pad Thai was perfect! Love how they were generous with the sauce so it was packed with so much flavor. If there&#39;s anything I don&#39;t like, it&#39;s dry pad Thai! But this was the complete opposite of it! It was tangy with flavors of sweet and hints of salty from the fish sauce. Amazing. I almost wish that it was me that ordered the dish but luckily my friend and I shared our dishes :D 

I ordered the pad see ew with chicken. This was a good dish pretty good dish but it wasn&#39;t up to par with the best ones I&#39;ve tried. It definitely needed a bit more flavor. Nothing too major. But the thing that gave it away was the noodles-- overboiled! Yeah, I don&#39;t think so. Again, it wasn&#39;t too a hot as I&#39;ve had super overboiled noodles and it wasn&#39;t enjoyable to consume. Still compared to what I&#39;ve had in Vegas, I would choose this option over anything else. 

Love the service there. They were prompt and always asked if we needed more accommodations. Loved my experience here and I think this will be my go-to Thai restaurant when I&#39;m in LA! It was awesome to have discovered this place!"

We ordered 4 dishes to share among the 4 of us and each one was delicious. [1] Pad Kee Mao (Drunken Noodles) - stir fried flat noodles with onions, peppers, basil. My favorite style of Thai noodles. [2] Tom Ka - coconut curry soup. [3] Pad See Ew - stir fried flat noodles in soy sauce mixed with Chinese broccoli, fried egg, shitaake mushrooms, and fried tofu. [4] Yellow Curry with duck. Everything was delicious. You know the food is good when everyone stops talking when the food arrives.

Noodle heaven.

Yes they are CASH ONLY and yes they are open pretty late! Get your after midnight Thai fix here!

I ordered their chicken pad see eww and the noodles and flavors were great! I really liked that their chicken was a rotisserie style. Definitely gives poultry more flavor.

My bf ordered the Generals Noodles and the broth was light and aromatic. The noodles were cooked just right. Soft and had a great texture. Best soup noodles I&#39;ve found as of yet. You can also order this dish dry (no broth)

The food isn&#39;t too bad either. Higher priced than some of the other Thai places in the area but they do give you a nice size portion.

I came and ordered dinner to go the other night. Decided on the Sanamluang Noodle soup and a side of Panang Curry with chicken. It took a while to get my order because the place was pretty filled up and they had a bunch of pick up orders.  When I finally got my package, it was a nice sized bag. It turns out they separated the soup and all the ingredients from the noodles so you assemble it when you get home or to your destination.

The flavor of the broth was delicious. Slightly spicy but not overly so. Just the way I like it. They are generous with the protein too that there was so much I had enough for a second meal the next day.

The Panang curry was the bomb. The sauce was super thick, similar to the way another Thai place I really like makes it. Never had it this thick since starting to dine in the area, it was always a thinner more watery sauce but not so here.

It&#39;s a casual setting like most of these Thai places in the area but at least you get outdoor dining choices too and the menu was filled with a lot of super yummy Thai dishes.

They have a small parking lot because it&#39;s in a mini mall but it gets crazy-packed, especially at peak hours, but they do have a valet help park your car as well as direct traffic when you&#39;re trying to get out and there are cars waiting to park.

This place is up there on my places to go for Thai in the area. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be back again."

This place is almost there in term of food. I know it can&#39;t be exact since the ingredients are not as fresh or harder to find but they are pretty close. 

The spicy beef noodles are really good. I know some people may stray away from them since it does have liver and some organ flavors in the soup, but give it a try. 

The pad Thai was good also. I&#39;ve had better but it was good overall. I like how this place is a small restaurant that is hidden and probably not too many people know about it unless the were told by a friend."

But,

Two negatives:

First, they take cash only. We barely had enough cash in hand. Luckily we didn&#39;t have to go to an ATM. We would&#39;ve...they had good reviews. So we were willing to be inconvenienced. 

Second: they make delicious food but it&#39;s loaded with grease. Our food was swimming in oil. I am no expert in Thai food, but in my many years of dining I&#39;ve never see food that greasy, Thai or otherwise. Literally, we&#39;ve seen less grease on fried chicken or cheap pizza. You know, the kind of pizza that you have to dab with a paper towel because it&#39;s dripping with grease. My curry was worse than that. 

I&#39;ve posted pics. You can see my &#34;yellow&#34; curry dish and rice. You&#39;ll also see my side dish with just oil skimmed off the top of my curry dish. 

I ordered yellow curry but it came out red in color. Not necessarily a negative for me because whatever the heck I was eating was delicious.

My guy had a delicious dish...arguably the best non-curry dish I&#39;ve eaten. I love my curry and potatoes (coconut milk soup?) dishes. I loved it. But...soaked in an oily mess. 

By the end of his dish the remaining good was sitting in oil. 

Overall, if we&#39;re ever in the area again we&#39;d probably go back. I had my eye on several dishes. The staff very friendly. Quick service. But, it would be on rare occasions. Took too long to try to remove so much oil from my meal."

I&#39;ve had this place bookmarked for years, but as of yesterday, I can finally say I&#39;ve been there. I&#39;ve done that. 

It&#39;s cash only so I made sure to make my way to the bank before swinging by. All the stars seemed aligned as I pulled up and found a parking spot, in the small lot, eliminating the need to drive around looking, hoping for street parking. 

Walking in and immediately being seated at one of the last open tables was great timing as well. Other customers ended up sitting outside. Not that it was freezing but it definitely wasn&#39;t warm. The heaters were on and even I felt a blast of &#34;chilly&#34; every time someone opened the door to the restaurant. 

Service was pretty good. Not friendly, nor unfriendly - but good nonetheless as they were attentive and not rude. As busy as the place was - the staff did a great job. 

And the food - a bowl of Beef Tendons and Stew Noodles, Combination Fried Rice and Ka Na Mu Krob (see pics). The soup was served nice and hot. Great portion size for the price with lots of beef and noodles - not so much tendons but the taste made up for the lack of tendons. The beef was shred apart tender and the noodles were cooked to my liking. Just a little al dente. The combination fried rice was a little warm but that could be because I was slurping up soup before I went for the rice or crispy pork dish. For the rice - also good taste and for my liking, I just added a little salt. The crispy pork dish was my least favorite, though I liked it as well. Wish the veggies were a little warmer and that the pork wasn&#39;t as dry as it was but the dish was still good overall. 

I&#39;d say the wait was worth it and that I&#39;ll be back. I&#39;ll even drive around looking for parking next time if I have to."

The Drunken Noodles were PERFECTLY spiced, but be aware those who don&#39;t like spice. It&#39;ll make your nose run a bit, but it&#39;s great for the sinuses.
The Pad Thai was alright. I appreciate that they don&#39;t dry the noodles out and it&#39;s tossed with beansprouts with additional beansprouts on the side for beansprout lovers. 

The ladies who serve are very efficient. I really like how you can ask any server for something and it is promptly brought to you. They are quick to drop water with ice and lemon (so if you don&#39;t want either of those in the water, make sure you ask when the menus are dropped).

The Koo Chai appetizer I tried fried-- it was delicious especially the sauce. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.

Tom Kha Kai is on of my favorite soups EVER and theirs is delicious. Chicken pad Thai is HANDS DOWN the best I&#39;ve ever had. Hands down. I&#39;ve tried the Pud See Ew with beef as well, which was good but didn&#39;t blow me away. Then again, not my go to dish anyways. Combo fried rice is SO yummy (even the tomatoes taste good!)

Of the curries, my favorites are the Green Curry w/ chicken and the Yellow Curry. Red curry is good too with lots of bamboo shoots which have a great texture (also not super spicy), and panang was good, but really salty.

The only two dishes I&#39;ve had that I would not revisit are the Spicy Basil Leaves Fried Rice and Pad Ka Pao, both because it tasted like pure salt which made it hard to stomach.

To top it all off, the Thai tea with boba is delicious! Service has been SO quick when I&#39;ve dined in and picked up. They&#39;re all friendly and it&#39;s overall such a great hole-in-the-wall."

Otherwise I&#39;ve been coming here since I was a little kid, the food isn&#39;t as WOW AMAZING as I remember it being back then but what really is. Pallets change. Whenever I&#39;m in thai town I&#39;ll switch from here, Thai Patio, or Sapp cafe depending on which specific dishes I feel like eating. The prices have gone up and do seem to rise every year but such is life. 

I really like their &#34;General&#39;s Noodles&#34; here. Good Egg noodles in a right portion. The last time I was in I ordered pad see ewe it was pretty good. Not the exact taste I remembered from the previous time but it was really late maybe over midnight and I was really tired."

It was a bit hard flagging down a waitress, because I don&#39;t think they come to you if they think you&#39;re ready. But once you get their attention they&#39;ll come by.
My friend ordered the combination fried rice (which I believe was number 59) while my other friend and I shared the pad thai with no peanuts and a chicken satay.
The fried rice was good after I sampled a bit and the pad thai was also decent as well.
I asked for no peanuts on the pad thai and it came with peanuts lol but it&#39;s not a big deal. It&#39;s because my friend didn&#39;t like peanuts but they didn&#39;t sprinkle it all over the plate so that was alright.
The chicken satay came with some toast, peanut butter sauce, and this pickled cucumber jalapeño thing. I think we were all hungry and buzzing so it was delicious. But regardless I know this place has good food so I&#39;m not complaining. They give a lot of food for the price and we had to take it to go.

Tip: cash only but there&#39;s an ATM conveniently located nearby on the right side of the plaza when you exit the cafe.
Also open late at night so be thankful for the food after you&#39;re hungry from a bar that doesn&#39;t serve food or it&#39;s too expensive lol."

The food is whatever and I waited over 20 mins for my food while everyone arrived after me got their food and the servers were just hanging around and chatting. They just forgot my food. After I got one server&#39;s attention about our food he brought up my friend&#39;s food that that was it. I had to wait another 15 mins because I wanted to give them another chance to make my food and bring it up. Finally got sick of waiting and me starving, I got the server and asked about my food again. Less than 5 mins later they brought up my food. Wow. They really just forgot about my food and doesn&#39;t it seem odd that one person was eating and the other one was just sitting there?

The service is slower these days, but they are becoming popular.  Prices remain great!  Two people can eat well for $25.

The crowd remains a fun group.  From the drag queens, families, and extremely white face/red eyed late night partiers, you can also enjoy the people watch.  And the staff, they really try hard and do a great job.  It is very much a family style, including service.  So it you need something - ask.  They do not monitor your table the whole time.  Just pretend you are at your favorite Aunt&#39;s home.

Parking -  No big.  the valet, since the cram a lot of cars into the tiny parking lot.  For me, I often just park up the street.  Yes, it is a block away, but I need to the when I finish up."

There isn&#39;t much Sanamluang doesn&#39;t prepare as good or better than other Thai restaurants. Its late hours make it a perfect stop after a night of drinking, and the service is always friendly dining in or out, but be prepared as it is cash only. 

In addition to serving stellar versions of your normal noodle dishes such as pad thai or pad see ew, the standouts here are the fried tilapia, smothered with a semi-sweet chili and garlic sauce, and pork leg over rice. The fried skin of the tilapia with the sauce is like the perfect bite of fish chip, and being able to eat all the fatty, rich parts of the fish in the chili and garlic makes the experience extra special. Finish with one of the best, milky, not overly sweet Thai iced teas in the city to help curb the spicy heat that will undoubtedly fire up some of their dishes."

We ordered the drunken noodles with medium spiciness which ended up being pretty spicy, so be careful!

It&#39;s usually my go to place when I&#39;m in Thai town. They&#39;re known for having the best noodles in town. And noodles are practically all I ever get whenever I come here. 

Parking is just plain terrible since it&#39;s located in a super small plaza. Nice thing is that sometimes they have a valet attendant there to assist you. The place is a pretty small place inside. I&#39;ve noticed that they&#39;ve been doing some remodeling with their interior. There&#39;s also outdoor seating with heaters. For service, service has been very consistent throughout the years. 

Food:
Spicy beef noodles - also known as boat noodles. This is mostly the main reason why I come here. I tastes best when it&#39;s spicy so I usually get medium spice since I can&#39;t handle the spice to its fullest potential. I have not found a place that does boat noodles better than sanamluong cafe. Hollywood is only an hour drive for me and I will make that drive just for these noodles. 

Roasted duck noodle soup - my alternative to boat noodles. I usually get this when I&#39;m craving something soupy and not spicy since this soup still has a lot of flavor. 

Pad see ew - my other alternative when I don&#39;t want anything soup related. Flat rice noodles with black soy sauce and Chinese broccoli. 

Pad Kee Mao - it&#39;s a bit oily, but I think I would prefer this over pad see ew. Pad Kee Mao comes with more flavor and spice. It did come out spicier than I intended. And the meat also comes out grounded rather than in pieces."
sanamluang-cafe-los-angeles,Greg T.,ZMc68qAU0oKEbJqercHPYA,"Los Angeles, CA",1,1,1,99,279,Xmu2N3Av__jt9pLZ7ZQbzA,4.0,2015-05-28,"In the past few months, Sanamluang has replaced Ruen Pair as my favorite restaurant in Thai Town.  The restaurant itself is pretty spartan with few decorations adorning the walls.  That&#39;s not a bad thing given the way in which some restaurants overwhelm you with tacky posters and artwork.  In general, the restaurant is clean.  The tables are giant slabs of granite (?), makes the restaurant seem classier than the plastic booth benches would otherwise imply. There is a large patio if you&#39;d like to sit outside.  Service here is good, as the staff is attentive and helpful.  We once spilled a bowl of sauce before even getting to taste it (doh!) and the staff quickly brought us a replacement without prodding.  

The following are the dishes I&#39;ve ordered multiple times: 

CHA PO
Cha po is a rice plate featuring a mix of pork (fried and bbq) and duck.  I was first introduced to cha po at Ruen Pair and found their portion of meat much less generous and satisfying.  I&#39;m happy to report that the cha po at Sanamluang is SO MUCH better.  Because the rice is limited to a single bowl-size mound, the meat has the opportunity to take center stage.  The duck is nicely roasted (e.g. tender and juicy) and flavorful even without the dipping sauce.  Normally, I don&#39;t like how duck sometimes tastes gamey, but I&#39;ve never had encountered that problem here.  The barbecue pork is pretty standard, but done well.  The fried pork is VERY crispy, and I would recommend letting it absorb the dipping sauce to soften it up.  Otherwise, you might have a hard time biting into it.  Highly recommended.

PAD SEE EW
The restaurant claims to have the best noodles in town, and given the quality of my pad see ew, I wouldn&#39;t disagree.  This is by far the best pad see ew I&#39;ve had at a Thai restaurant in LA!  The pad see ew has the perfect balance of sweetness and savoriness due to the sparing use of soy sauce.  The ratio of meat and vegetables to noodles is good; I didn&#39;t feel like the restaurant skimped on the toppings.  At times, the noodles can be a little oily, but that hasn&#39;t deterred me from making this one of my go-to dishes.  Highly recommended.

CHICKEN OVER RICE
This dish was reminiscent of Hainan chicken, but wasn&#39;t necessarily as good as what you might find at other restaurants.  The chicken was generally tender, but there were some pieces that were a bit dry.  I probably would order something else before trying this again.

BEEF SALAD
I wasn&#39;t a fan of this beef salad.  While the salad certainly had flavor, it wasn&#39;t that impressive, and I encouraged my friend to finish it so that I could save room for the other dishes.  We asked for the salad to be medium spicy, and it definitely reflected that.  The lime flavor was noticeable.  And, there was ample beef.  But, I didn&#39;t think everything came together that well.  Maybe that&#39;s due to my dislike of lettuce-based salads - they&#39;re so boring!

Parking in Thai Town, like most dense neighborhoods in LA, is terrible.  They have a small valet parking lot, but I typically try to find free street parking in the residential neighborhoods.  This sometimes means that I have to walk a block or two to the restaurant, but that&#39;s not the end of the world.

Overall, I would highly recommend Sanamluang Cafe if you&#39;re in Thai Town.  They&#39;re open late, so this is the perfect place to grab food after a night out on the town in WeHo or Hollywood.  The food is great, the service is good, and the prices are comparable to other places in Thai Town!

Note: Make sure you have cash on hand, as the restaurant is cash only!"

This is where my hubs and I were turned on to thai noodle soup. To me it&#39;s like a cousin of Pho - light broth, thin noodles, loaded with thinly sliced meat, meatballs, etc. But the big difference being the spices of the broth. Aka garlic and fish sauce heaven at the crack of dawn."

Koo Chai- Deep fried soft rice biscuit stuffed with Chinese vegetables, served with hot and sweet black sauce. Surprising delicious and I would order this again.

I was wrong. Sanamluang Cafe definitely lives up to their banner &#34;The Best Noodle in Town&#34;.

We ordered 2 noodles - Pad See Mao, and General&#39;s noodle. To my surprise, both of these noodles could very well be the best thai noodles I&#39;ve tasted.

Pad See Mao (5/5) - Served with flat rice noodles. This dish is a bit similar with Pad See Ew but cooked with tomatoes. The dish is hearty, vibrant, and the flavor is spot on, I would highly recommend this dish if you haven&#39;t had it before.

General&#39;s noodle (5/5) - Jonathan gold&#39;s favorite dish here and I can see why. In contrary to Pad See Mao, general&#39;s noodle is a noodle soup served with thin egg noodles. The broth is nicely infused with BBQ pork, duck, and shrimp which all came with the dish. The broth is sweet (from the bbq pork), salty (from the duck), and savory at the same time. I still can&#39;t believe that I have not heard of this dish before.

Would definitely come back. I heard their duck salad is also pretty good."

Flat rice noodles with egg, squid and shrimp in this sauce that is just Mmm!!! More of a dry dish than a soup, which is what I personally prefer.

They are loaded with meat and you will not leave this place hungry.  Every time I&#39;m in the area I still come here (coz I now live 80 miles away!).  No doubt, you have to come here if you want authentic Thai cuisine!"

The parking lot is tiny and congested. If you can&#39;t squeeze into a spot here, you have to park in the street.

I grew up eating pad thai at Sanamluang Cafe. However, adult me prefers the pad kee mao or thai boat noodles. The noodles are cooked to a great chewy consistency and the sauces are wonderfully flavored with a great balance between sweet, tangy and spicy. Nothing seems out of place or lacking.

One thing I have to note is that their thai iced tea is amazing here! It&#39;s not overly sweet and has a slight creaminess. It is served with crushed ice and crushed ice makes all the difference! The servers recognize my parents every time we come and they are so friendly and welcoming."

There were so many things we wanted to try from their extensive menu, including the boat noodles everyone raves about. We finally settled on chicken Pad Kee Mao and Roast Duck Curry. 

PAD KEE MAO (DRUNKEN NOODLES):
The Pad Kee Mao, also called drunken noodles in some places, consists of flat rice noodles, tomato, sweet basil, onions, Thai chilies, and your choice of ground meat, all tossed in a sweet soy and fish sauce mixture. Our waitress asked if spiciness was ok, and we said yes. With that said, the minced Thai chilies added a definite kick! The dish overall wasn&#39;t blazingly spicy, but every now and then you would get a bite that would leave a lingering heat in your mouth. I loved this dish!

ROAST DUCK CURRY:
The Roast Duck Curry was a coconut-based red curry with bell pepper, pineapple, and tomato. The pieces of roast duck were excellent. Duck can be game-y or strong, but it worked so well with the curry here and didn&#39;t have any offending flavors. The roasted skin was probably my favorite part, kind of silky and gelatinous after being soaked in curry. The curry was on the sweeter side and soupier than I&#39;m used it, closer to a Tom Kha Gai consistency. I wish it had a bit more spice or savory flavors, but overall it was a great complement to the spicy noodles.

Our total was only $22 with tax and we took leftovers to go, so definitely a steal! Just remember it&#39;s cash only."

I have to say that it&#39;s really good value - my boyfriend, uncle, and I ordered 3 noodle soups, 2 appetizers, and 1 Thai iced coffee. The bill came out to be $43 (before tip). 

We started with Koo Chai and Chicken Satay. Koo Chai is described as soft rice biscuits stuffed with Chinese vegetables. You can either get this deep fried or steamed. I should&#39;ve gone with steamed because these little rice biscuits were way, WAY too greasy. With every bite, I started hating myself more and more. The Chicken Satay also had no flavor. I mean, it&#39;s pretty dumb to order Chicken Satay at a Thai restaurant, but I thought it was inexcusably bland. 

My uncle had the Sanamluang Noodles, my boyfriend had their Spicy Beef Noodles, and I had General&#39;s Noodles. I feel like the three of us were pretty indifferent about our noodle soups. I definitely felt like my broth was really bland and flat. I kind of just ate to eat, but didn&#39;t enjoy my food all that much. 

With the dozens and dozens of restaurants in Thai Town, I would skip Sanamluang Café and try your luck somewhere else."

Okay so I went to sanamluang about a night ago or two around 1 a.m after I hit up the family arcade that&#39;s in the area since this place is open late and this is my second visit here and let me tell you, this one was weird. I was sold the first time I came before this visit because they have the BEST wontons and also some really good egg rolls and that&#39;s all I really need. So my boyfriend and i ordered the same thing again but also ordered the number 67 dish? It&#39;s fried chili with basil and your choice of meat - i got beef. I usually get this type of dish at any other thai place so I was expecting it to be good. Of course at this time it wasn&#39;t packed but it wasn&#39;t empty, so they could easily serve all their customers in time. The food got here pretty fast but after they served us the food they never came back to ask if we wanted a refill or if we were doing okay or anything which I thought was weird because they passed by us sooo many times and my drink was basically done by the time we finished the appetizers. The beef was cooked really hard and so was the rice. We then proceeded to pay and leave. As we went to our car we sat in there for a minute because we were trying to set up google for  our way back home and before we could finish I noticed what seemed to be the head lady that was working at the time coming to us and at first I thought she was going to the car next to us because they ordered to go but then she came and as I was talking to my boyfriend he noticed her and he said she looked at our plates and then all of a sudden she started tapping on the window of our car??? It was so weird, so I rolled down my window and I said hello and she said is everything okay? And we were like oh yes we&#39;re just trying to find our way back home and she asked us why didn&#39;t you leave a tip and my boyfriend and I just looked at each other shocked because we were just surprised that she LITERALLY came to our car to ask about a tip SO then we just replied what? And she said TIP! THE TIP! And kept yelling it then continued with &#34;WHAT WAS THE FOOD OKAY OR&#34; and we were just scared at this point and we didn&#39;t want to say anything to her to make her more angry so we lied and said no it was good even though we weren&#39;t satisfied with the main dish or the fact that the service is horrible and then she continued still saying &#34;WHY DIDNT YOU LEAVE TIP&#34; and I&#39;m not exaggerating when I tell you that she wouldn&#39;t leave until we gave her money, she continued questioning us and then told us &#34;I don&#39;t know where you come from but over here you have to tip&#34; and at that point we were just done so we handed her three dollars and she gave us a stank eye/dirty face look and said sarcastically thank you and left. I&#39;ve never had that happened to me or my boyfriend before and this was so weird for us because we&#39;re just college students. We weren&#39;t making a scene or being rude to the serves, we just came to eat some wontons and leave. It was honestly the WEIRDEST thing ever. I was seriously afraid she was gonna kick the car if we didn&#39;t give money or do whatever she had in mind when she looked at our license plates lol. Overall I give a 2 stars mainly for the wontons but other than that I don&#39;t have much good to say."

They acknowledge us, but continued to talk and the waitresses did not do anything about it. Besides that, the food is delicious. I drive all the way from Westminter just to get Thai food in LA! I have tried many dishes, but my favorite has to be the pad see ew chicken and the pad ka pao (spicy ground beef.) I also like the Thai tea that is serve in shaved ice.

----------------
After 3 visits to this restaurant, I have concluded that the food served here is tasty, filling, and affordable.

During my most recent visit here, I ordered the Cha Po - a plate of BBQ pork, roasted duck, deep-fried roasted pork, cucumbers, and rice (also included is a bowl of soup). It satisfied both the palate and gullet, and was a pretty good value for only $8.50.

The Thai Iced Coffee served here is excellent as well - delightfully sweet and creamy (albeit *heavily* loaded with crushed ice - BOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!).


THE BAD
-------------
I should note that while the service here is not exactly &#34;horrible&#34;, neither is it &#34;spectacular&#34; ... you place your order, they bring your food/drink, and you&#39;ll need to get their attention if you need/want anything else - except (apparently) for the check, which they will *promptly* bring to you without asking, so as to indicate that they would like you to please pay and then GTFO.

(Note: If you want to enjoy a meal at a leisurely pace, and then dillydally after you are done eating, you&#39;d best take your ass someplace else to eat.)

Yeeeepppp ... pretty straight-forward, wham-bam-thank-you-ma&#39;am-type service, with no pretensions by the staff about actually liking any of us wretched patrons ...

(Note: If you want to see some emotional labor in action, you&#39;d best take your ass someplace else to eat.)


THE UGLY
---------------
The tiny-ass parking lot in front seems chronically packed every time I drive by the restaurant, and the men&#39;s restroom is both filthy and tagged-up.

the truth have been my mother and father since birth.   The fact is, this is the best Thai
place in the city. The service is great, even when busy.  The food is out of this world. 
If anything can be made with an ordinary ingredient, they also have an upgrade, for example,
not just Chinese broccoli, also Morning Glory.  Why settle for chicken, they also make it with
duck!  And it is meaty duck, applied with a grim determination to win you over!  Probably twice
as much as my local takeout place!

As broke college students and sick of dorm food (or simply after a night out), we would make the trek from Westwood down the skanky streets of Sunset and Hollywood. Yes, you might run into Sidewalk Sallys sitting next to you or a few other harmless characters (i don&#39;t judge), but nowhere else can u order the best chicken fried rice with a sunny side up egg on top. I don&#39;t care what anyone else says, but through global revolutions and economics crashes and social changes, Sanamluang is a Thaitown institution.

Soup Noodles probably go to Sapp Coffee Shop and Pan fried noodles probably go to Yai (however Yai falls behind with their meat in these dishes). 

However Sanamluangl might have the best noodles overall. The flavor of their noodle dishes and quality of meat is superior to the competition and they make every noodle dish well here. 
The Pad Kee Mao is probably the best dish I&#39;ve had here and might be the best noodle dish in Thai Town. The Pad See Ewe isn&#39;t far behind.

The basil fried rice might be the best fried rice i&#39;ve had in LA as well (not a fried rice fan though). 

Pad Thai is pretty average, I would skip.

Green Curry wan&#39;t the best either.

Shrimp Cakes are very good and are a nice way to start or accommodate the meal.

This restaurant is open late, so it was the perfect place to go after a concert. Our friends frequent this place often, so we came here under their advise. If you choose to park your car inside the parking lot, you have no choice but to do valet. It wasn&#39;t too busy when we came and we were seated right away. I like how they have outdoor seating as well (perfect for a summer&#39;s night out). I would&#39;ve chosen to eat outside except it was raining (I know!) at the time. 

The restaurant was buzzing away with orders and people coming in and out. It seems that they have a pretty quick turnover of customers, so I don&#39;t think waiting is an issue.

Not only does it remind me of grandma&#39;s great cooking, it&#39;s a family owned business so you truly are getting grandma&#39;s cooking, because we all know grandma&#39;s cooking is the best!

I ordered the chicken torta and two tacos. The torta was great! Including avocado, lettuce, tomato and jalapeño (optional) with a side of their home made salsa (super spicy).  Must have again and highly recommended to anyone wanting a good torta in the area or Mexican food in general. The tacos were delicious mixing it in with the hand/home made tortillas which gives the tacos so much more flavor.
The cost of the food plus what you get is unbelievable. 100% quality and 100% quantity, perfect enough to leave you wanting more. This spot is the new place I will be going to for some good Mexican food on a budget.

I read so many great reviews and saw that it was vegetarian friendly and mexican food isn&#39;t hard to veganize so I thought perfect, if nothing else I can get bean tacos. Sadly, the beans are cooked with lard. I had seen from another yelper&#39;s review that they accommodated their order request and added nopales to their chilaquiles order. I tried doing that this morning and the lady that was taking my order immediately said no they couldn&#39;t do that, I mentioned the yelp comment and she acted like she didn&#39;t know. I ended up ordering 2 nopales tacos even though I knew that the nopales would be served cold on a hot, made to order corn tortilla, sadly I didn&#39;t like them, cold nopales are just not my thing and could only eat 1 of the 2 that I got. That, I believe is just personal preference, if you like cold nopales then those tacos might be for you.  

My boyfriend is a meat eater, he ordered a beef torta, he said it was really good and that he&#39;d come back to the restaurant for it. 

My kids had cheese enchiladas, they said they were good and finished all of them. 

As a vegan that likes to experiment and veganize food and not just go to vegan restaurants this place was not a hit, won&#39;t be back but my bf might!"

The chicken enchiladas in tomatillo sauce was the best I had ever had.   In L. A. I hadn&#39;t found anything to compare, and I had gotten to a point where I gave up trying to find comparable enchiladas in green sauce here. Yeyas enchiladas in green sauce is the best I have tasted, even surpassing Restaurant Mexico.   Enough kick in the sauce to bring a sweat to my brow,  and a symphony of flavors, with tender,  juicy chicken!   I am lucky to live only two blocks away from them!  I am craving them now,  and it&#39;s way past closing time"

I recently just had THE BEST vegetarian burrito I have ever tasted here at this humble establishment. As it has been mentioned already, coming to Yeya&#39;s fills you with the nostalgia and feeling that you are in your grandma&#39;s kitchen. This is definitely a no frills kind of place, but what it lacks in swank it definitely makes up for in quality, flavor, and ultimately hospitality.

The burrito I had was jam packed with beans, rice, cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion and a generous serving of avocado. I must note that I am sure that there definitely was at least half of a medium avo in there which was a total surprise! I honestly didn&#39;t look at the price on the menu but I was anticipating this Chipotle sized burrito to be at least $7 so I was incredibly shocked when the bill came out to $5 flat. Such a steal!!

What I loved the most about the menu is that they offer SO MANY Lent friendly options! (enchiladas, veggie burritos, tacos de nopal, and even pozole de camaron which I really want to try!) 

I came here at around 11 on a Friday morning and service was very very prompt, though I would assume from so many great reviews that this may not always be the case. There also isn&#39;t much seating so I&#39;m wondering if I just got really lucky. Just something to keep in mind."

As a Colombian transplant from NYC, I don&#39;t have too much grounding to make this judgment, but my partner is an LA born and raised daughter of Mexican parents. She ranked the pozole just below her mother, her aunt&#39;s, and her grandmother&#39;s in Mexico, and says she has not found a better pozole in LA. It was not canned hominy, and the broth was not too thick. The meat tasted fresh, and onions, radish, and lettuce were all also fresh. 

We also had the quesadilla with pollo, and taco de camarones. The tortillas were freshly made for both. The taco had a great amount of shrimp, and the salsa was delicious. It also had chopped pieces of cooked green pepper. Excellent. The quesadilla was nothing out of this world, but all the elements were great. With two half-litros of coke in a glass bottle, we paid just $20!!! 

We were able to sit at two little tables outside. The restaurant is right in front of Mariachi Plaza and has a great view of downtown straight down 1st. I will definitely be returning when I find myself close to Boyle Heights!"

I&#39;m still in disbelief that it took me so long to try this place out. What the hell was I waiting for? Maybe I used the lack of parking as an excuse for far too long. 

The food is phenomenal. All of the tortillas are made by hand, which tells you that you&#39;re in for a good meal. We tried the pozole, a carne asada sope and a barbacoa quesadilla. Everything was amazing and tasted homemade. The sope was one of the best I&#39;ve had. First of all, it was huge! Second, the masa was so tender it practically melts in your mouth. The quesadilla was packed full of flavor. The barbacoa was   tender, juicy and seasoned with all the right spices. The pozole was a white pozole with white and purple hominy. It was really tasty and did not disappoint.

We went on a Saturday night and there was only one other family there. The place is tiny and has limited seating. I&#39;m not sure how long the wait would be with a full house."

The hubby and I wanted &#34;home made&#34; authentic Mexican food and after searching on Yelp we decided to give this place a try! Not disappointed at all! 

I got Pozole and oh my goodness it was almost as good as my mothers Pozole. It was the flavor that made it. It was like if they stole my mother&#39;s recepi! My husband got Lengua en salsa and the meat was so tender and delicious. We each got a small dish before our entree which was a small &#34;sopita de fideo and a taco de chicharron&#34; and they were both good. 

This is not a fancy restaurant or somewhere where you pay a hand and a leg for the view, service or name. This is a &#34;cocinita&#34; where you have good if not excellent HOME made food from a family run joint. 

Price: $ cheap. 
My husband and I got drinks, appetizers and main entrees for less than $30 bucks.  
(Go to L.A. Live Rosa Mexicano and you&#39;ll pay $75 for the same 3 items) 

I shall try their homemade flan next time, (I was too full) It looked delicious and it was like $2.50!! Right??!"

Location: On First Street one block east of Boyle and directly across from the Mariachi Plaza Metro Gold line station. 

Parking: Limited street

Atmosphere: Family run hole in the wall w home-style details. Pictures on the west wall are of history, faith &amp; observation. The chalkboard [limited] menu shows their focus &amp; flexibility. No prices posted but if you ask they will tell you. This is not a fast food place, everything is made to order so it takes a bit of time. The 4 booths &amp; counter stools are next to the kitchen where you can watch as your meal is prepared.

Each time I&#39;ve come for dinner the smell of roasting pasilla chiles has welcomed me. The familiar crackle tickled my senses as they roasted &amp; I ate my meal. The fragrance reminds me of my Dad&#39;s birthdays because that&#39;s the only time my Mom slaves herself to make chile rellenos. lol

They let me change the channel to watch the novelas on #34 but I was warned the over the air antenna sometimes goes out.  I look around in disbelief. Am I home?! lol

Food: I proclaim my creator with every bite for each gives me flashbacks my Mami &amp; Tia&#39;s cooking! The flavors are excessively familiar so I had to ask where the owners are originally from. Holy smokes! They are from exactly the same city as my family, Guadalajara! Thus their weekend menudo has NO hominy! lol

My taste buds take me through rides down Guadalajara streets: Periferico, Federalismo, Avila Camacho! Flashed through a worm hole I am suddenly at my Tia Gelo&#39;s (RIP) kitchen &amp; her laughter fills the room. I take another bite &amp; I am zoomed to my Tia Reyes&#39; ranch where she&#39;s patting corn masa &amp; cooking them on the comal over a wood fire to make quesadillas using queso fresco from the cows grazing next door. Another bite and I&#39;m flashed to my Abuelita&#39;s (RIP) house where I&#39;m livin&#39; it up w my family. Virgen de Zapopan! Please don&#39;t pinch me, I am dreaming!

They typically let you know off the menu dishes or specials as soon as you are seated. Everything is made to order but owners mentioned that if you are craving something off the menu &amp; they have all the ingredients available they will prepare it for you. 

Highly recommended: (will edit as I try the rest of the menu)
- Chile rellenos (regular sauce &amp; one w nopales/cactus)
- Caldo de pollo (chicken soup, has chayote/pear squash), zucchini, carrots, &amp; potato)
- Caldo de res (beef stew has nearly the same veggies as the chicken soup)
- Enchilada plate
- Sopes (hand made not fried if you want!)
- Sopa de fideo (noodle soup)
- Quesadillas
- Champurrado
- Habanero salsa is hella spicy but very flavorful. One drop is enough for me! lol
- Pozole salsa wakes the dead! Not for the meek! lol
- (Walk-ins seem to enjoy the tacos)
- Off the menu: nopales/cactus with egg
- Off the menu: chicken pipian (nut based mole)

WC: Clean, there is a step down to the ladies room."

I come not only for the delicious food but also for the melancholy that this place brings. It reminds me of eating an afternoon meal in Mexicali; the time when all businesses close for lunch and kids come home from school to eat the most important meal of the day with their loved ones. The food is delicious, not greasy and full of flavor. All tortillas and slopes are made by hand and the ladies are welcoming and never have a frown to offer, only smiles.

If you are looking for an authentic homemade Mexican meal, Yeyas is the place. If you are looking to quench an antojo, Yeyas is the place."

They gave out a sampler of their tacos dorados (tacos with crunchy shells) - one chicken, one shrimp and one potato. They were SO good that I&#39;ve been trying to go back! Parking around the neighborhood sucks since Mariachi Plaza is pretty busy on the weekends with festivals, farmer&#39;s markets and what not. But we finally got parking today!

The place is tiny and totally mom-and-pop. The menu is written on a board above the register and everything is in Spanish. There are no prices listed, but things are cheap. At least one of the waiters will be able to speak English if you need help. We got the tacos dorados and were not disappointed. They were just as delicious as I remembered. The chicken tacos are rolled like taquitos and are pretty small, so we got 3, which was perfect for my boyfriend. I got 2 shrimp tacos, which were a mixture of shrimp, tomatoes, onions, etc and are stuffed into a tortilla and fried. SO GOOD. Also, they are huge. Two was definitely enough. They come with shredded lettuce, tomato sauce and cheese/sour cream on top. 

While we were there someone ordered soup, which looked delicious, and I noticed the lady was making all the tortillas from scratch. Yum. 

All together, our 5 tacos, a liter of Mexican Coke, and a coffee cost $11.50. Totally worth it! We will be back.

I was waiting for a few friends and the guys behind the counter asked me if I was waiting for people and I replied yes. Once I answered yes, he told me that they closed at 11pm.

I completed my meal with a bowl of sopa de fideo. I squeezed a bit of lime and added some cilantro, and the flavor instantly transported me back to my childhood. I felt like I was in Mexico, happily slurping up the hot soup in my grandmother&#39;s warm kitchen. =)

My review is solely on their shrimp tacos. In short, it&#39;s a MUST TRY. The shrimp themselves aren&#39;t deep fried like the typical shrimp tacos you find. Instead, the shrimp are stuffed inside a corn tortilla with their mayonnaise like based sauce and deep fried. It&#39;s then topped with a fresh slaw, a side of sour cream, and hot sauce (optional). 

If you&#39;re a taco or shrimp fan, this is a MUST try!!! They were so in demand at the taco festival that people were willing to wait upwards of 30 mins just to get a taste of their shrimp tacos. I can&#39;t wait to visit their restaurant and try their other specialties. I hear their potato taquitos were also must trys!"

The food was super fast and they cook it immediately right in front of you. It is never too crowded the both times I have been there so their understaff factor did not affect my meal.

They have a menu that is written on a white board in Spanish only but not all the food items are always available.

However I love their homemade tortillas, I had their chicken tacos and it was prepared fresh. My friend had their steak burrito and it was huge, greasy and tasty. Portions are bigger than normal and it seems very home made which I liked a lot.

The only complain I have is that they have no air conditioning and like any typical legit ethnic food places they don&#39;t have customer service (which I don&#39;t mind) but you just have to ask the waitress/ cook for water."

Bernie&#39;s is a good and inexpensive place to eat. I do love the bbq beef stick (wish they gave more or bigger pieces). But what I like here the best is the sauce for the beef. It makes the beef and chicken delish. They give you a right amount of rice for your food. I love the salad dressing here. And I love mixing it with my rice also. You can&#39;t bet cheap eats here. The parking is small like the beef portion. lol The inside is old school burger joint but just covered. You feel like this place should be opened like a burger joint.

My boyfriend found it by chance because it&#39;s near his work, and took me here for lunch. I never would have noticed it otherwise, because it&#39;s pretty teeny-tiny. One of those underrated great spots to know about if you&#39;re in the area.

Bernie&#39;s has a weird, small parking lot with a steep slope. But hey, at least there is parking! There are signs warning drivers to make sure their brakes are set securely.... makes me wonder if there have been some rolling incidents. Inside the restaurant is small, smokey and not much to look at...... concrete walls, picnic tables, and not the cleanest. You&#39;ll forget about all of that once you order at the window and get your food. Best to take your order to go or enjoy it on the patio outside. 

We ordered the beef/chicken combo for around $6. It was delicious! The meat was flavorful, tender, and juicy. You can pick a breast or leg (refraining from The beef kebab was my favorite..... not at all fatty or gristly, and didn&#39;t even need extra sauce. It comes on a place of fried rice, and some salad (well, leaves of iceberg buried under the rice) with Thousand Island. It&#39;s a really good meal for minimal damage to your wallet.

Orange bang and Horchata pair well with the food.. I also order won ton soup when I have a hangover.

We decided to get two chicken teriyaki plates, one beef skewer plate, and a side of fries. The fries were soft and pretty bland. The chicken was equally as flavorless as the fries - if not more - and tasted like nothing. The teriyaki sauce that was provided made both the fries and the chicken taste much better than they were without it, but it wasn&#39;t an enjoyable experience.

Yes, teriyaki usually means Japanese, but Bernie&#39;s  is undeniably Filipino. 

The most popular plates feature a quarter chicken or three pork (my favorite) or beef skewers piled on a mound of fried rice. The sauce is light and flavorful, and there are bottles available if you want to totally drench your meal in it (you&#39;ll be tempted to). There&#39;s also a bottle of unlabeled red hot sauce that adds a nice little kick. Each plate is served with a small side salad drenched in a thousand island dressing; over the years, I&#39;ve learned to automatically say &#34;no salad, rice only&#34; when placing any order. Do yourself a favor and add that phrase to your visit.

The restaurant itself isn&#39;t the cleanest in Echo Park, but the food more than makes up for it. There&#39;s outdoor seating as well. I usually pick up a pork bbq plate on the way to a Dodgers game ... actually, truth be told, I usually eat a plate at the restaurant and then take another into Dodger Stadium. There&#39;s nothing better than a plate of Bernie&#39;s while watching the Boys in Blue."

Super friendly service and very reasonably priced for what you&#39;re getting.

The one thing keeping me from giving them a fourth star is a HUGE factor that many have previously mentioned. The indoor portion of the restaurant gets so smokey that I ALWAYS have to go outside to wait for my food. After five minutes of being inside my eyes start burning and I begin to cough from all the smoke. Not to mention that when it gets packed it gets very cramped and loud. Definitely order to go as many times the tables are not something you&#39;d want to sit down and grub on.

Sure, it is cheap...and yes, it does look good...but it was pretty terrible.  The food at Bernie&#39;s is a perfect example of getting what you pay for.  It is very inexpensive, but I would have gladly paid much more for a better meal.

I first ordered the chicken and beef combo.  The chicken and the beef were very salty, and were pretty small portions.  It came with what tasted like salty brown rice to me.  It was nasty, and was most of what was on my plate.  I expected white rice, and this was what primarily ruined the meal for me.  The salad was also bad.  Mostly because there was hardly any, but a bunch of dressing dumped on it.  I don&#39;t think I have ever had a salad with more dressing than lettuce.  It was not good!

Unfortunately, I was still hungry after eating the combo plate.  I took a risk and ordered a chili-cheese burger, hoping it would be better.  It wasn&#39;t.  It was actually worse tasting than the combo.  *shivers*

I can&#39;t see myself eating at Bernie&#39;s ever again.  All of the food was either too salty, bland, or covered in dressing.  It just wasn&#39;t my thing."

I still consider this place to be a hole in the wall. Since my last visit they have changed a few things. 

For instance, there are no longer sticky tables; it looks as if they have repainted their tables once again and this time put a finish coat which is much appreciated by this regular. 

They also got rid of their ATM machine, so make sure you have cash before you stop by. 

They have a &#34;B&#34; grade which isn&#39;t awful but definitely not the best.

Lastly, there was a cat roaming the inside of the restaurant which freaked me out tremendously. I know for a fact that if there is a bird flying around a super market they have to shut down the whole establishment and take care of it right then and there. So, what&#39;s the protocol for a stray cat . . . apparently nothing?

Overall
I love that Bernie&#39;s is a family tradition of mine. Their food (mainly their sauce) and prices have always been more than reasonable but I really think they could use a facelift as well as some adjustments to their overall business strategy. I like a good hole in the wall as much as the next but there comes a point where you start to question if it&#39;s okay for it to be this dumpy.

Just a hidden gem in Echo Park.  I found out about it through a friend.  The chicken and beef plate is just amazing.  I think it&#39;s the teriyaki sauce that makes anything it brushes with spectacular.  It&#39;s very light but full of flavor.  The food is pretty cheap as you can see from the menu.  A plate consists of a choice of meat (pork, chicken, or beef, or a combination), fried rice or white rice, and a salad (which you can just trade in for more fried rice).

The only downside is that it&#39;s not a fancy place and the decor is, well I don&#39;t think anyone tried!  I usually just go here for take out or for a quick bite.  I wouldn&#39;t recommend it for a hot date if your girl/guy is high maintenance."

the teriyaki combo with beef,pork and chicken was so-so. the fried rice was cold and the chicken was bland. the beef and pork were tough and dry.  i guess you&#39;re supposed to drizzle all these sauces on them and eat it. i tried the teriyaki sauce and the hot sauce. it did taste a little better but i still think it was overrated.

the fried fish was really crispy but the fish didn&#39;t seem fresh.  it was nothing special.

there&#39;s poor ventilation. the smoke from the grilling from the kitchen comes into the eating area and makes the room smokey. after you come out from the place, your clothes and hair smell like bbq.

The sauces they give you to go with it are a great match.

Definitely a gem in LA. The food here hasn&#39;t disappointed for as long as I&#39;ve been eating it. I usually alter between combo plates. Either Chicken/Beef/Pork or Chicken/Pork. The meat is served on a bed a fried rice which is complemented by green onions, and tiny side salad. .The salad is also on the plate, and the dressing will usually mix in with the neighboring rice.  
I&#39;ve never tried anything, nor have I had the urge to. I wouldn&#39;t fly all the way to Italy and ask for a hamburger."

But what happen this week was something different. I ordered 3 chicken plate that has fried rice, 2 pieces of leg and some salad each to go. We decided to eat home and relax in front of the TV. About an hour after our lunch, my stomach started grumping and I had diarrhea. The awkward feeling stayed for almost three days. I found out that my sister had the same experience too. There was also a third person in the household that got sick too. Then, a nurse in the family advised that salmonella is acquired if the restaurant is not careful about handling the chicken. I don&#39;t know if that is the case with us, but three of us got sick after eating the chicken plate. It may take a while before I order chicken from that restaurant again. It maybe different in another day but let me take a break first to forget that experience.

8-1-2016 I came back ten days ago and ordered a chicken plate and soup. They are both good this time."

This is a Filipino place run by about 6 men jammed into a small kitchen slamming more than 100 plates during their average lunch hr.

I&#39;ve been going to this place for awhile now and just realized that we have &#34;YELP&#34; now. lol.  So here is my thoughts.  The food is good(changed alittle) still good though and the service has changed alittle since then, the wait time for the food is also alittle longer (due to the growing number of customers they have now). More customers, more food that needs to be prepared.  I&#39;m ok with that. For people that are in a hurry for lunchtime (call in your orders early when they open) and you should be ok.  But, they do need to do something about that (when they  get a rush of customers/orders in). 

Second thing: Did I mention i&#39;ve been going here for awhile now?.... 36 years to be exact! Not quit as long as they&#39;ve been open but close enough.  My dad used to take me here when I was in 1st grade. 

Lastly,  Yeah! I totally agree with everyone else. This place needs a &#34;FaceLift&#34;.

Located on a hill is Bernie&#39;s Teriyaki. For $6 you get a quarter chicken with rice and a few pieces of salad with a thousand island dressing, throw in another dollar for orange bang and you got yourself a meal! 

The chicken was moist and tasted great. I&#39;m not sure if they have a restroom here and I think they take cash only as well. 

Overall, great filipino chicken. Health and filling. You can&#39;t ask for more. One recommendation though, for those who park on a hill, remember to use your parking brake... you wouldn&#39;t want your car rolling backwards on a hill..."

Was is in the mood for some cheap pizza and based on the pictures of their menu i thought this would be good.

Paid $8 something for a medium pepperoni with extra pepperoni. I was a little confused when i paid when a medium on the menu is $5.99. Extra toppings says $.75. Hmmm ok, I should of said something when I was there. Medium is more like smedium. It&#39;s a whole 10-11 inches! 

Taste is basic. Reminds me of school pizza. Tons of cheese, sauce is kind of bland. I liked the crispy crust.

Service was just as bland as the pizza, but I wasn&#39;t expecting much.

I&#39;ll give it one more try."

If you&#39;re sick of all the name brand pizza places in town with their up-charged prices, crummy service, and mediocre pizza quality, then Slicey&#39;s is the place for you.

The 2 most important parts to a pizza for me is cheese and sauce. The freshness in the flavor of the cheese at Slicey&#39;s was the first thing that came to mind as i took my first bite. It&#39;s as if a fresh block of cheese was grated right on the tip of my tongue. The sauce was also very well mixed, with non-overpowering aroma and taste , but yet bridges the dough and cheese perfectly. Although i did wish there was a little more sauce, so for all of you sauce lovers out there, make sure the request is made. If pizzas&#39; not enough, grab the buffalo wings which are oh-so-delicisoso and well sized in comparison to all the other pizza places in town. 

To sum it up, Slicey&#39;s gets right to the point in defining a good ol&#39; fashion pie of pizza (pie = pardon my east coast lingo for a whole pizza). The simple menu makes this place an easy and dependable place to go to when you know what you want. I really got a bang for my buck here at $9.99 for an X-Large cheese pie and $8.99 for a 12 piece buffalo chicken wing order. Who doesn&#39;t love quality with quantity? =)"

They also have my favorite drink, Squirt LOL. 

I believe the place is owned by the couple that manages the place and they are so cute. The place itself is a little nook in the corner. There aren&#39;t as many seats, however it&#39;s not crowded so you should be fine. The parking is not valet so that&#39;s a plus! 

I also got the house salad and buffalo chicken wings~ You get a choice of dressing and they give you a good amount :)

This pizza place looked nice, so I decided to check it out. The owner, Sarah, is really nice and chatted to us while we waited. Turns out the Korean restaurant next door is her moms! This entire corner has restaurants that look good.

My boyfriend brought me back for (cheap) Date Night, which I didn&#39;t realize was such a good deal in hindsight. It was less than $20 for: 

- Large pizza (the dough is made with unbleached flour, sauce not from concentrate, fresh toppings)
- Wings
- Salad (simple, but not the sad kind)
- Churros!!!!!!!!!!!

They also had a new selection of interesting soda, the blood orange one is refreshing. It&#39;s easy to see that the owners care about taste, and pay attention to detail from the ingredients in their dough to each decoration in their cute shop. 

Delicious Pizza is much closer to me, but I prefer Slicey&#39;s for the quality without pretentiousness and price. I&#39;ll definitely be back!"

They explained what happened and made up for it in more ways with their food. I&#39;ve definitely have found my Friday night pizza spot. Two thumbs up! :)

If it seems too good to be true, it usually is.  This place is within walking distance from my home and it has rave Yelp reviews.  So I gave it a try.  I should have known, all 16 prior Yelp reviews were 5 stars, which seems a little too good.

They use really cheap ingredients that have been sitting in the freezer too long and the pizza was undercooked.  It tasted awful.  One reviewer writes about their quality cheese.  This is laughable.  The cheese had no cheesy flavor because it was probably the cheap stuff made with vegetable oil.

Their fortune cookie (why do they give fortune cookies?) has an orange tint to it that looked unnatural and I just threw it away.  The crushed red pepper that comes in little packets was so old it had the withered look of something that&#39;s been freeze dried.

Normally I would not write a negative review for a small neighborhood joint.  I live in the neighborhood and I want the neighborhood businesses to thrive.  But on this occasion I feel that I&#39;ve been misled."

But listen, when you have a quick n easy pizza, whether its cheap dominoes or cheap lil caesars, you can taste the cheap.  When you pay cheap, you get cheap, or at least when it comes to pizza in california.  You want quality, you gotta go to some hidden, downtown spot or some special italian place thats all overpriced.  no lie, I&#39;ve only been here a couple times and i&#34;m ever going back to pizza hut or paying 20 dollars for a large pizza at some fancy italian place. you know when you lift a slice, how the cheese stretches in all those commercials?  thats how Slicey&#39;s do it and your not paying for it either, they have prices for a damn bargain, even my homies started tripping when they tried this pizza lol. I got a large with 3 toppings for like 10 or 11 bucks and they all said they never had a pizza so cheesy n bomb for that low. i mess with those wings too they&#34;re nice.  they got a really chill young lady there too who always greets you, i think she might be a co-owner or something.  also, cant beat the location and their chill lil lot, easy n accessible. i know everyone got an opinion when it comes to their pizza preference, but if you&#39;re in korea town, and you want the best bang for your buck, hit this place up."

We saw this one had good reviews, and thought maybe third times the charm? This place is defiantly a pizza &#34;joint&#34;. Tiny, nothing fancy and not flashy. There was an adorable couple who greater us warmly and were very helpful. This is a basic mom and pop place with no frills. We ordered a large ham and onion, 12 bbq wings to go. The pizza was simple but tasty. Nice amount of cheese, light sauce, nice dough with just enough chew to my liking. Wings were juicy, a bit sweet for my taste (they also do them hot, which we will try next time for sure!), but decent. The price was very reasonable for the quality. (Really a good deal actually) This place is not really a dine in spot, but we will defiantly be picking up from here again soon! Well worth a try."

Nervous that we were not going to be able to dine here, being it a Sunday night and reading how you must have a reservation - we got lucky. A quick phone call and the very nice lady over the phone said she can squeeze a party of two in if we get there in the next 20 mins ... SCORE!

We were blocks away already, so arrived just a bit early, sat outside and was generously greeted and called in by the hostess. The place was packed, the vibe was great, and the service was exceptional. Although, if you are sitting for a party of two, expect to sit very close to another party of two as two, two tops are placed side by side. No big deal at all, as there was enough room for our food a bottle of wine, and enough space to enjoy ourselves. 

The menu cut to chase, broke it down in a few different sections and provided you with the right options in each. A one page menu; is usually desired so you are not sitting for days and reading through everything. We ordered the  Trofie Alla Riviera, Lasagna Verde, and a side of mushrooms. Oh and don&#39;t forget, they have an extensive list of wines; if you feel like having a glass or two (maybe three, lol). The mushrooms, were seriously cooked ON POINT, not drenched - just sitting in sauce, still had the correct texture to them and were perfectly served in my opinion. The lasagna was actually pretty darn good as well as the pasta we ordered. A lot of people&#39;s reviews speak about the lasagna being a bit dry without enough cheese, although, I thought the melted/cripsy cheese on top was just enough and the lasagna was quite moist inside that it did not nee any extra of either. In fact, my friends mother that was born and raised in Italy; make her&#39;s pretty similar. 

Overall, I believe they have earned their five stars based on the balance of everything being great, and nothing over the top. The style, ambiance, service, staff setup, menu, food, wine ... were all consistently good. This may not be the best Italian food you have ever had, although, they do everything as a restaurant in whole, pretty damn well. 

Definitely bookmarked, and will be back!"

Nice surprise. This restaurant is very casual and simply decorated. It&#39;s small, but cozy. There is a front patio that was empty because it was cold when I came. In fact, every time the door opened, a cold draft came into the restaurant.

In any case, this place has the feel of authenticity, although their prices certainly reflect this...

For appetizer, we ordered the burrata and beet salad. It was just OK. Burrata was good, but the portions were relatively small. However, I loved my lobster cavatelli. The pasta tasted homemade and the texture was impressively good. The others at my table got the duck pasta, which was also delicious, as was the salmon cooked medium. For dessert, we tried the torta della nonna, which was not something I would usually get, but was really delicious. The roasted pine nuts were divine."

Greeted with welcome food - pasta salad (3.5)

black truffle pizza - (2.5)
honestly, I was going to give 2, but due to the amount of truffle (it&#39;s quite a bit) +0.5. 
Pizza dough was nothing special. Not chewy or has firing smoke taste or smell.
Truffle aroma was very nice, but pizza itself was too rich and creamy. Wanted to have jalapeno
Well made cheese or even oily cream pizza won&#39;t make me crave for those pickles, but here it did.

Thought price was tiny bit pricy. 
If it were tastier, I would have thought the price was reasonable (cuz I am a foodie and willing to pay whatever amount for super tasty food). I didn&#39;t get the pasta, but pasta dishes look pricy too.

Great quality Italian dishes and reasonable prices make this restaurant a tough place to get reservations for the weekend. This restaurant has been bookmarked on my list for the longest time.   

Angelini Osteria is a small Italian restaurant in the Beverly Grove area of LA. The décor inside is clean and modern. It&#39;s between the lines of casual and fine dining and for the most part looks like it&#39;s run by family. 

We came here on a Friday night reservations at 7:30 pm. With dinner tables lounging around, we weren&#39;t seated till 8:30 pm. Our table was hangry and thirsty and they came out with water and bread. The bread was more like a giant thin cracker.   It took a while to get our order since the restaurant was packed liked a can of sardines. 

We ordered the flowing:
Tortelli di zucca: Very good pumpkin squash stuffed tortelli with butter, sage and asparagus. 4 stars.
Lasagna verde &#34;Omaggio Nonna Elvira&#34;: Spinach pasta, besciamella with a beef and veal ragu. Good but wish this dish was screaming sauce and cheese all over the place. Saucy dishes are ideal for me. Cool presentation with the fried basil. 3.5 stars. 
Grilled organic chicken: For my chicken lover friends. It&#39;s grilled and wood oven finished with crushed red pepper. Served with roasted potatoes. Very good. Chicken lover friends approved this dish. 4 stars
Linguine Santa Barbara Sea Urchin: Sweet tasting uni sauce, garlic, chives, crushed red pepper. Wish they doubled up on the pasta. Solid! 4.25 stars
Scallops and mushrooms with chives in a balsamic reduction: Tasty but a bit overcooked 3.5 stars.

Overall, very good entrees. Great mix of pasta dishes and meat/seafood entrees. Service was okay due a busy night. 

I&#39;d definitely would come back hopefully on a less busier night. Also would like to try their new café next door that just opened."
angelini-osteria-los-angeles,Mary S.,Dbbq6c6gYh71OXrTTpsJ9Q,"Los Angeles, CA",1,1,0,51,1332,huDtozWCY3YeLL51xqK_nA,5.0,2016-11-08,"Ever since watching an episode of &#34;The Best Thing I Ever Ate, CHEESY&#34; a few years back, Giada De Laurentiis, one of my favorite chefs, spoke of the famous Lasagna Verde at Angelini&#39;s, so I knew I had to try it for myself! Not sure what took me so long to get here, but one thing to keep in mind about LA and its restaurants is that, if it has stuck around for more than a few years, then they&#39;re doin somethin right!

Get ready for me to rave about the lasagna just as Giada did in that episode. But first, let me speak about the rest...

My first impression when I walked in was &#39;No wonder reservations were a B!+@h!&#39; It is probably one of the smallest fine dining restaurants Ive been to, but well worth it, of course!

To begin with, they bring out flatbread crisps with a relish-like corn dip. I didn&#39;t see how these 2 fit well together. Had they opened a jar of Prego marinara sauce with the flatbread, it would have done the trick. Corn? Italian food? Hmm :/

We ordered quite a few entrées. The Beef and Ahi Tuna Tartar Crostini are a definite must! Super fresh and tasty! The Grilled Octopus Salad was also delicious!! And a must! The Mushroom w/Scallops, however, I can pass on. I love scallops, but the mushrooms were overpowering with flavor because of its balsamic glaze reduction. The Truffle Pasta w/Sausages was amazing! Although it seems overdone with the amount of shaved truffles atop, it was pure perfection. The Uni Pasta wasn&#39;t bad either, but it was missing some salt. If you&#39;ve had Bestia&#39;s Uni Pasta, then you know this one doesn&#39;t come close to it! Finally, the Branzino. It was melt-in-your-mouth mmm mmm good! Cleaned and served table-side...amazing!

Lastly the Lasagna Verde!!! I literally sat down and watched the episode with Giada all over again before getting here. Something about the way she describes good food...you know it&#39;s going to be BOMB! So here it goes....I absolutely agree with her 100%! The way the spinach pasta comes together with the ground beef/veal, béchamel sauce, and parmesan-reggiano, is just incredible. The deep-fried spinach atop definitely gives it that added bite to the soft, airy lasagna! My favorite lasagna thus far!!!

Nonetheless, the desserts weren&#39;t arousing. Although, I recently read an article about there expansion, &#34;Angelini Alimentari,&#34; a more gelato, espresso, quick bite kinda place. Hopefully they&#39;ll meet up to the rest of there standards. 

Till next time...Ciao"

It has an authentic Italian feel, which I loved. Tables are on top of each other but no one seems to mind and it makes the place feel homey and intimate. 

The moment you are seated they bring over a perfectly crisp, thin bread with a little olive oil. Next, they bring a complimentary fish soup for the table with veggies in a nice tomato broth and side of a small pasta salad. What a treat! 

I ordered the lobster salad and my colleague ordered the tagliatelle with duck ragu. The pasta was perfect. The duck ragu was shredded and rich and the pasta was perfectly al dente. It took me right back to Italy.  The lobster salad was a nice, light entree with peaches, spinach and pomegranate seeds, but was nothing in comparison to the pasta.

I saw the branzino being filleted for the table next to us and it look incredible. 

We finished with the best panna cotta I have ever had. Panna cotta is not a dessert I gravitate towards, but this had loads of vanilla bean and was a thick custard texture. 

I&#39;d love to come back for dinner and try even more of the menu!"

Food overall was very good, and of course, we ordered way too much by most people&#39;s standards. Prices are generally higher than other Italian restaurants so the $$$ is about right, but if you&#39;re frugal, you&#39;re looking at the wrong place anyway.

Onto the many dishes we ordered...

Sautéed scallops (4.25/5): not the most interesting dish, but very good

Soft shell crab (4.5/5): crispy and not heavy, would get again

Beef carpaccio (3.75/5): one of the weaker beef carpaccio dishes I&#39;ve had, I&#39;d pass

Zucchini flowers (5/5): I&#39;m a sucker for zucchini flowers, especially their version that&#39;s stuffed with ricotta and accompanied by a spicy tomato sauce...mmmmm...

Swordfish carpaccio (3.75/5): sounded interesting so we got it, but it didn&#39;t taste good enough to warrant seconds

Roasted veal bone marrow (3.75/5): I appreciate fatty dishes, but this was a bit much for me. It&#39;s very comparable to Bestia&#39;s version. Both make you feel like a tub of lard.

Lasagna verde (3.75/5): call me weird or whatever, but to date, the best lasagna I&#39;ve had was a veggie lasagna served in my high school&#39;s cafeteria. I wish this lasagna had a nice crust to it. I see how others may like it, but it didn&#39;t work for me too well. Maybe it was because they served it at the same time as like 5 other dishes so we couldn&#39;t eat it right away.

Branzino (4.75/5): surprisingly good! I&#39;ve only had it once or twice in the past, and this has been my favorite. The one at Bestia was pretty weak compared to this one. The fillet of fish was light, refreshing, and delicious.

Liberty duck breast (4/5): would&#39;ve really appreciated some mashed potatoes with this dish, but 10 dishes in, I definitely didn&#39;t need it. The balsamic went well with it and the duck was cooked medium rare per our request. Nice choice, but there are better options on their huge menu.

Crema di mascarpone (4.25/5): felt guilty eating this since it&#39;s basically cheese in cream form, but tasty for sure. Wish they had more strawberry to go with it, but worth a try...unless you get the panna cotta.

Panna cotta (4.75/5): really enjoyed this panna cotta especially since I prefer desserts that aren&#39;t too rich or heavy. It was pretty jiggly and had a great texture. Definitely worth a try.

Service was friendly and accommodating. 

The decor was small and cozy. We chose to sit at the counter because we didn&#39;t want to overhear the whole conversation of a date going on next to us at our previous seating. Others mentioned that servers bump into you here and there, but it was hardly an issue for me.

It is on the pricier side, but definitely worth a visit at least once. Easily one of the better Italian restaurants in Los Angeles so it&#39;s not a bad idea to take a tourist either. Our total for 2 came out to around $280 after tax and tip, but that&#39;s probably not the norm. Was thinking about having my birthday dinner here, but the space doesn&#39;t seem like it can accommodate large parties well."

The ambiance is intimate and conducive to conversation.  It&#39;s the perfect little spot to meet with a friend and catch-up.  I came here with my dear friend from church to celebrate our birthdays. 
The chef offered us a complimentary soup and risotto.  They were both delicious.  The fish soup was full of flavor.  It tasted fresh.  The veggies were perfectly cooked. 

The bread basket had bread that appeared to be pizza crust, but it was actually very light, airy and crispy.  I loved it! It was seasoned with herbs and a bit of garlic.  

I ordered the beet salad served with cheese and mix greens.  I love beets and I was not disappointed.  For my main course I ordered the truffle pasta.  The truffle was grated at the table.  The aroma perfected the ambiance with every bite I ate.   My friend ordered the scallops and for the main course Gnochi.  It was all perfectly cooked, perfectly served and nicely presented. 
They have a small dessert menu, but it&#39;s all very good.  The server brought each of our desserts with a candle and sang happy birthday to us.  It was very nice.  My latte has nicely presented with foam art. 
This is a simple, yet elegant place to enjoy good food. 
I definitively recommend."

We arrived 30 minutes earlier, and found out that our reservations were accidentally booked the following day. However, there was no issue because they promised to seat us by our reservation time which was very accommodating. 

When we were seated, we were presented with a basket full of their bread and complimentary appetizer. The bread is thin and crispy and their couscous appetizer has amazing flavor. It is savory yet sour and the couscous is chewy and delicious. 

We started off with the smoked salmon pizza. I really liked how the smoked salmon complimented the arugula and cheese perfectly. I loved the pizza because it was fluffy, airy, and thin crust and definitely fresh and homemade. 

Next came the famous pastas. We ordered the sea urchin linguini and the lasagna verde. The sea urchin linguini was delicious the first few bites, but the uni became overwhelming. The favorite dish of the night was the lasagna verde. The flavors were incredible and it was one of the best lasagnas I&#39;ve ever eaten. I could see why this is one of their most popular dishes.

Finally, my friends surprised me with a birthday dessert which was the mascarpone with strawberries. Together, they worked beautifully because the tartness of the strawberries paired well with the sweetness of the mascarpone. But, they definitely give more mascarpone than strawberries, so we were left with a few bites of the mascarpone which we couldn&#39;t finish because it was too cheesy on its own. 

A great Italian find and I&#39;m glad I wasn&#39;t disappointed for my birthday!"

octopus arugula salad was aslo really really good. The octopus was cooked to perfection, with a light crunch to it on the outside. Together with dressing and arugula made a perfect appertizer.

Penna cotta was also excellelant, just the right consistency and texture, silky smooth but first enough. Amount of sugar was right, not overly sweet"

And when you enter you are welcomed by staff that is friendly and as warm as oven fresh focaccia. It makes up for the work you must do to snag a table. (Almost 60 days out after years of being open for biz). But then it took Michelangelo 4 years to paint the Sistine Chapel. Both worth the effort.  

The vinyl wallpapered wall are accented with a few amphoras and some nondescript contemporary Euro-art. But you came for the best pasta in the City and so ye shall receiveth.  

Within seconds of making your nest at the small bistro table a bottomless basket of Pane Carasau (sheet music bread) wood fired with Sea Salt and Rosemary shows up still warm from its turn in the oven. Next, someone puts a bowl of Farro with house Pickled Mini-Vegetables on your table. I thought the last diners left it which didn&#39;t stop me from pushing it onto my knife with my foot and inhaling it. Finally, a vat of Garden Tomato Soup with bits of oil packed Tuna and roasted Swordfish (yet another gift from the chef) is placed before you. Holy Spumoni a trio of antipasto gratuito. 

There are 8 seats sorta facing the oven at the space behind the service bar. Sit there if youmust or you&#39;ve been naughty. Better to opt for a seat at a table but please note that the tables are so close you will instantly know who slept with the dog walker and why, along with all the pre-planned plausible denial excuses in case of discovery.There you are at ground zero. Play your cards right when your neighbor isn&#39;t looking you can snatch a corner of the beautiful veal chop you didn&#39;t have room for.

There are also a few tables curbside affording the unbridled luxury of being close to uncorked motorcycles and lost Melroseans strutting, preening and prancing past your pasta. 

Lay back and have a glass of Costaripa Rosamare Chiaretto Rose, Lombardo 2014. As gay as a bag of butterflies and as fruity as Richard Simmons. The Aneri Proseco from Venice was as dry as Dick Cavett. Both great choices in my humble besotted view.  

The Vibe: Any Italo-foodie in the know, knows that this is probably the best Italian food in the City. Who goes there? Ex-pats, butter fats, regulars and irregulars. PS: Any Italian chef in town heaps praise on this kitchen and deservedly so.  

The Alcohol Protocol: Beer and Wine. Mostly Italian. It is a well curated list with plenty by the glass options. So, those of you who have commitment phobia you can breathe easy while your glass of Valpolicella Allegrini breathes.

The Food: The Braised Artichokes were soft as puppy paws. Truly authentic, this dish was as  simple as a Trump policy and as strait forward as a Bill Clinton proposition. 

The menu is varied and, alas, I wish I was sired by a camel and had three stomachs. Once my eyes returned to their sockets there was Bombolatti Mancini All&#39;Amatriciana with Guanciale, Tomatoes, Crushed Red Red Pepper and Pecorino Grand Cru. Now, there&#39;s a mouthful...literally. This is wonderful house made little tubes, al dente and simply dead on the spot perfect. I could have eaten a cargo container of it.

The Spaghetti Chitarra played a tune on my heart (and tummy). As rich as Trump says he is. But this dish is richer by far once the flurry of shaved truffles land like snow flakes on your noodles. It&#39;s as decadent as flying your own Gulfstream 4 from Aspen just to eat this. (This plate was a mere $45 and buried in truffles). Load a box of it to go in the G-4.    

Dessert: Crostata and Cassata. Sounds like an Roman law firm. Both plates were magazine cover worthy. The Crostata and Cassata could end the infantada if all the combatants made a wish and got a dish. 

Osteria Angelini...only a weenie in a beanie would not want to go here. I can&#39;t wait to wait another 60 days and go again."

I think to be fair overall it was a 4 star experience. I think I was a little bit disappointed  bc I had such high expectations... So let&#39;s get into the details:

Food: 
1) Mussels &amp; Clams (3/5): It was good start to dinner. The dish was flavorful and the mussels and clams were well cooked but it wasn&#39;t exceptional. There was nothing special about this dish and I felt like I could get this dish anywhere else...
2) Uni Linguine (5/5): LOVED IT! It lived up to the hype. The dish was creamy and had big chunks of uni on top. What blew me off was their actual pasta/noodle - fresh, homemade, and cooked to perfection. 
3) Branzino (3/5): I was little disappointed with this dish bc I had high expectations. The presentation was awesome... Bring out the fish in this salt/flour/egg white shell and they filet the fish right infront of you. The fish was good but not amazing. It was soft and tender and well cooked but it was bland and didn&#39;t have much flavor. The accompanying mash potato and veggies were unimpressive. Overall it was just an ok dish with great presentation.
4) Panna Cotta (4/5): Very good but not the best panna cotta I&#39;ve had.

Overall, the food was just ok for me except for the uni pasta which was exceptional. Next time I think I would skip their entrees and just get their pasta dishes. 

Ambiance:
The place was quite interesting and not what I expected. The whole restaurant is rather on the small side and rather crowded. I felt a little claustrophobic in there. All the tables were extremely close to one another and servers and guests were squeezing by tables to get through. There were multiple times when the waiters almost knocked over my wine glass... and they actually did knock a glass over on the table behind us. It was rather a stressful dining experience for me.... esp when the big table next to us had kids running around... I expected a quiet romantic dining experience with my bf for our anniversary yet it was rather painful for me to get thru dinner with everything going on... It pretty much feels like you were at a restaurant in Europe where space is an issue... But I can see why others would like the experience... but it didn&#39;t do so well with me. 

Service:
Overall service was good. They were timely in taking our order and bringing us our food and checked up on us when needed. No problem in that department. 

Parking:
There are meter parking around but we just valet bc it was easiest."

This spot is small , but buzzing.  I enjoyed the energy and chatter sp much. I ordered the grilled octopus with arugula and baby tomatoes, for appetizer and Branzino as the main course. It was delish, moist and succulent   paired with proseco.  It was divine!  My friend ordered the duck pasta and it was fresh and rich. I&#39;d definitely come back to try the lobster and pasta. This place is perfect for casual dinner. The service is top notch."

I have been a number of times over the years and it is exactly what I remember and also what made it so wildly popular. The food ROCKS period end of story. 

The salted bread would be as if a combination of Laffa, Focaccia, Naan and cracker all hooked up and had a wayward little bread love child. Mix in the refreshing and delicious Farro salad that accompanies it and your off to a fantastic and addicting start to your meal.

Ok let the culinary oral orgasm begin the Artichoke in truffle oil appetizer was superb with great depth of flavor a nice crisp yet moist and bursting with flavor.

The Norma pasta with eggplant and goat cheese omg so good cooked perfectly and such a wonderful combination of flavor profiles. At this point the chef is playing with us and we are mere putty in his masterful hands.

Seriously people you have all heard about grandma&#39;s famous and special lasagna that is the signature dish. It is just sublime and so not lasagna but a plate of culinary genius for the discriminating palate to appreciate and devour. Each bite is culinary nirvana. At this point I don&#39;t smoke but I need a cigarette and minute to regroup. Not unlike a Harry Met Sally moment in time but the result is the same.

The Scottish Salmon expertly cooked with a crisp on the skin but a moist pink interior was divine. The basic straightforward yet perfectly braised spinach and a red pepper coulis was so simple yet so well executed. Just the perfect compliment to a great meal. 

The Chocolate Hazelnut gelato with espresso was a great ending to a superb meal and dining experience. 

The food is refined and so good you and your taste buds are teased, aroused and ultimately pleasured beyond belief. It&#39;s a culinary smorgasbord of delight in your mouth. 

Angelini Osteria is a mainstay on the LA food scene and should be considered a destination. The restaurant is small, cramped, crowded and fairly basic with regard to aesthetics nothing of note, nor is it trendy other than amazing food lol The service is good, attentive and straightforward which is perfect because it matches the decor. Reservations are in demand but it&#39;s worth it trust me. 

The whole salt crusted Branzino and Porchetta are finished and plated tableside and should be appreciated as well.
 
No hesitations go to Angelini Osteria and be prepared for a great meal that appears simple yet is complex and just so very good. You&#39;re welcome..."

I was really excited to finally get a reservation here on a day me and the husband both had off together. I heard such great things about the food but left a little disappointed.  The truffle/sausage spaghetti was good but not the best I ever had. The bone marrow appetizer was good...but still not the best I ever had. I had the cocoa oxtail ravioli which was just average. The octopus salad was another disappointment and wasn&#39;t seasoned well. It was like eating arugula out of the bag with no seasoning. The seating here is very close and I kept getting hit by people&#39;s hips or butts as they moved past the narrow walking areas. The waiter kept reaching over behind my back and bumping me to serve the table next to me. It was just uncomfortable and there were so many interruptions with unpleasant bumps.

Food. The BRANZINO was superb! How it&#39;s cooked and served was impressive. OCTOPUS SALAD. This was my favorite. Tasty Uni Linguine. 

The only downside,they only serve wines. No cocktails. Well,it&#39;s an OSTERIA but then their wine selection is infinite so it was all good."

The salad was a beet and burrata salad, it was good.  I ordered the lobster gnocchi with cherry tomatoes. It was also pretty good. The gnocchi was very soft and the lobster was super fresh. There was no heavy sauce, and I was pleasantly surprised since every Italian pasta dish is typically covered in sauce.  

Finally for dessert, we ordered the tiramisu. I don&#39;t like tiramisu, but this one was delicious. 

The service was excellent and very fast. I enjoyed my meal, but it didn&#39;t leave me craving this dish again; or wanting me to come back again. But everything I had, they did well."

FOOD
Pizza Margherita, Anduia (3 stars): The pizza needed to be crispy on the bottom, it was soggy. The sauce is really good as well as the cheese. The Anduia sausage was too mushy, wish it had more texture. 

Sauteed Scallops with Mushrooms and Aged Balsamic Vinegar (4 stars): Cooked pretty well and good flavor.

Ahi Tuna Tartar (4.5 stars): Good fresh tuna, and the pistachios with complement it really well!

Red Beets, Fresh Burrata, Mixed Baby Greens, Blood Orange Dressing (4 stars): Good ingredients.

Lamb chops (4 stars)

DESSERT
Apple Tart alla Milanese (3 stars): Meh. 

Thin pastry with cream (forgot the name) (3.5 stars): Pastry was crispy and thin. Dish was gorgeous. Couldn&#39;t find it on the menu online, sorry!

PARKING 
Street, if you&#39;re lucky...or valet for $5.

ATMOSPHERES
It&#39;s pretty small inside. The temperature needs to be worked on. It goes from cold to warm pretty fast, no in between. Not as crowded as it used to be so easier to get a reservation now.

SERVICE (5 stars)
Great service. You almost feel like you&#39;re in Italy with all the Italian accents :)

Overall not the best Italian food I&#39;ve had (Italy you made my standards higher!). They do make some dishes very well though. Service is great here. They need to work on their desserts, so many options but nothing creative."

I took a friend here for a birthday dinner and tried to make 7pm reservations the day before. They were all booked up until 9pm, so we decided to walk in instead.  The hostess had a table for two but she informed us she would need it back within the hour. Alright, that&#39;s doable. 

We started with the tuna tartare which was a bit salty, but paired with the arugula it wasn&#39;t bad.  I wouldn&#39;t order that again though. Then we split the lasagna verde and uni pasta.  Omg.  Both dishes were so good in their own way. The lasagna was light, had a great meat sauce, and was just so tasty.  Giada from the Food Network is right, one of the best thing I ever ate.  The uni pasta was cooked perfectly as well. It was seafood-y but not overwhelming. 

The restaurant is too small and too popular, noisy and dimly lit. Make reservations in advance.  Valet or street parking.  Service was acceptable."

If they think a place is even remotely as good as the old country, it&#39;s worth a visit for me. I have to say, it did not disappoint. The ambiance, the size, the service, Snoop Dogg &amp; Dr. Dre playing on the sound system in the bathroom, and most importantly the food. What&#39;s not to like? Well, maybe the price tag. But seriously, this food is worth it.

I like everything, but here&#39;s kind of the order I would place them in for me:

1. Grilled Calamari: Melts in your mouth. The arugula and pomegranate seeds provide a great compliment to it as the sweetness and freshness kind of cuts through the savory of the calamari, giving you more motivation to eat the calamari pieces. It&#39;s a never ending cycle. At least I wish.

2. Porchetta. Dude, they bring this giant porchetta to the side of the table and slice it right there for you. It was moist, tasty, and I think I&#39;m now a cracklings addict.

3. Octopus (Polipo) Salad. It&#39;s served similarly to the calamari over a bed of arugula. This has fresh cherry tomatoes on it as well though. They serve a similar purpose in the calamari dish though. It&#39;s kind of a fresh break from the savory seafood.

4. Branzino. They bring it to the table and carve the sea salt crust off right there. It was fresh, soft, and perfectly roasted. Came with lemon, olive oil, and sauteed veggies.

5. The tripe, tomatoes, and grilled cuttlefish. Look, tripe is not exactly my go-to food. It&#39;s got an interesting taste, and most places I&#39;ve had it I didn&#39;t really like it. This was different though. The acidity and strong flavor of the tomato goes perfectly with it. Give it a try even if you think you don&#39;t like tripe. Try something new!"

I just knew it when I was searching for restaurants near LACMA museum for a day trip to LA. Being a resident of Orange County, I find it difficult to expand my knowledge of LA eateries when it&#39;s so damn convenient to stay near home. It was a rare occurrence that we happened to be in LA to check out the museum and stay to avoid hitting traffic. And boy, am I grateful I did!

This restaurant is small and unassuming, humble front. I was expecting fancy and snobby but it was the opposite! The staff was so friendly and down to earth. We were 15 minutes early for lunch but were graciously seated instead of awkwardly waiting outside. We snagged the table by the window, the best seats in the restaurant! For a Friday, it was pretty slow at 12pm, which made it super cozy for us. The chef started us out with some flatbread and amuse bouche: a cold summer mixture of vegetables and some type of grain similar to couscous. It was very light and refreshing. My boyfriend was addicted to the flatbread which was light, crisp, simple, yet delicious. Next, we were given a roasted vegetable soup to share. It was rustic, light, yet flavorful. Exactly how soup should be!

Per yelp reviewer&#39;s recommendations, we went with the Uni Linguine and the Lasagna Verde. The Uni Linguine was my favorite! The Uni gave the dish a sweet, creamy, salty taste which complemented my wine perfectly. Our server recommended the 2013 Bruno Giacosa Roero Arneis which was light and dry. I really loved the pairing and will definitely order a carafe next time! The Lasagna was decadent, meaty, definitely a dish my boyfriend preferred. He only wishes the portion were larger since he would&#39;ve gladly eaten the entire pan! I would say it&#39;s the best lasagna I have ever had! 

Overall, service was excellent and the staff here are wonderful. We absolutely loved this place and plan to drive up to LA more often to stop by Angelini and try the other dishes. Spectacular Italian food that is simple and rustic yet elegant in the quality of ingredients used - ranging from truffle to Uni to veal! I&#39;m anxiously waiting to return to this place that feels so comforting, like home."

Veal bone marrow: came with gnocchetti and diced tomatoes and it was nothing but short of amazing! I liked it SO much better than Bestia because the flavors balanced out so well and it wasn&#39;t rich to the point where it got sickening.

Scallops with mushrooms and aged balsamic: my girlfriend and I LOVED this appetizer! Scallops were cooked to perfection and it had a crisp on the outside that was really nice!

Verde lasagna with beef and veal ragu: their seemingly claim to fame dish and in Giada&#39;s &#34;best thing I ever ate&#34; list. I really, really beg to differ because I thought it was just okaaaay. Maybe the hype ruined it for me or something but I def didn&#39;t think it was great. Maybe just okay good but not great...

Spaghetti norcina with sausage and fresh shaven black truffles: the noodles were cooked perfectly and the sausages (albeit tiny) plentiful. The truffle was just for show (and to justify this dish&#39;s $60 price tag) because as you all know, truffle does not taste like ANYTHING! Oh but truffle oil is a completely different story guys hahaa. All in all solid dish!

Vanilla bean panna cotta with raspberry sauce: simply DIVINE! It was a perfectly soft consistency with the right amount of jiggly!! Vanilla bean taste in every bite :P

Tip: make reservations!"

It was a Wednesday night around 7:30pm when we headed over. We actually didn&#39;t think we would be able to get into Angelini Osteria because we didn&#39;t have a ressie, but we were pleasantly surprised when we were seated right away. 

It&#39;s a cozy restaurant that&#39;s very simple, quaint, and noticeably authentic (per the Italian party that was seated next to us). Our server was very attentive, informative, and beyond friendly/welcoming-- all reflective of the Italian culture. Loved it. Huge plus: The pricing is very reasonable including the wine.

+ comped antipasti - Their complimentary antipasti is definitely worth mentioning. A really promising starter to what was going to be a great meal.

+ Salumi board - Mixed baby greens covered with a little mountain of meat (prosciutto, bresaola, mortadella, and salami) and topped with freshhhh fresh fresh burrata. Great appetizer to share over glasses of wine.

+ Fegatini - chicken liver, green beans sauteed in a balsamic sauce. This dish is perfectly executed, but the highlight is definitely the balsamic sauce. So damn good.

+ Lasagna verde - made with their spinach pasta, besciamella (white sauce), beef and veal ragu. Five out of five, 100%, A+. It definitely lived up to its hype. A must!

+ Spaghetti mancini alla norma - simple spaghetti dish made with eggplant, tomato, basil, and dried ricotta. The spaghetti  is cooked slightly al dente and the red sauce is impeccable. Great entree.

Great place for a one-on-one or date. I will definitely be back."

Seriously though, my boyfriend had been wanting to come here so we had a date night here before we went to the hollywood bowl for a concert.

Everything was good upon arrival. The valet attendant was really nice and for an extra few dollars let us keep our car there so we can uber to the concert.

When we got in we were greeted by the hostess which was very nice and had beautiful curly hair! :)

When we sat down they brought us this farro salad that was SO delicious! It had so much flavor they also gave us a complimentary grilled calamari dish which was good! We wanted some drinks, but decided to get a bottle that our waiter recommended which was quite delicious!  

We ordered a salad... which I don&#39;t remember what it was but it was good. I liked it more than my boyfriend. I believe it might have been the Tricolore

We got the LASAGNA VERDE which was literally one of THE best lasagnas I have ever put in my mouth. The cheese on top was cooked perfectly. Everything in it tasted amazing! 

The last thing we ordered was the bone marrow... Seriously, this was amazing. I highly recommend getting this and the lasagna... 

As I was eating the food I realized it tastes a lot like BESTIA, especially the calamari and the bone marrow with the gnocchi. I realized that it&#39;s the same chef. So, if you want some really good italian food and don&#39;t want to wait for a reservation from Bestia GO HERE!"

It just might be my new favorite Italian restaurant. We got lucky and were able to get a table for 5 calling in the day before, but usually it&#39;s quite hard to get a reservation. Anyway, where do I start?

FOOD: We ordered a few appetizers to share: the octopus, the tuna tartar, and the salami platter. All of it was fantastic and the tuna tartar was probably the best I&#39;ve ever had. For the entree, I ordered the beef agnolotti and this was probably my favorite part yet. A must try! My colleagues also enjoyed their dishes. The wine selection is pretty good as well. The price of the dishes aren&#39;t that expensive but the portions are small, so assuming you order a few appetizers along with an entree and wine, it can get pricey.

SERVICE: Our waiter was nice enough but the best part was that the chef gave us three complimentary dishes. Two appetizers: fried artichoke and a soft shell crab dish (fantastic btw); my coworkers dish was a little late and because of this they offered him a fancy looking complimentary salad.

PARKING: They offer valet and there is also meter parking but you would have to drive around to look for it.

AMBIANCE: We sat on the patio on a nice day and it was perfect. Inside is a bit cramped so I wouldn&#39;t suggest coming with a big party. This is one of those restaurants where you&#39;re definitely here for the food, not the ambiance."

We finally made plans to dine here on a Saturday night.  Making reservations was easy with a simple phone call.  We decided that this was going to be a pasta night so we picked a few to share and skipped the entrees though they did look tasty.

As we browsed the menu, our waiter brought out glasses of water, a crispy flat bread and some sort of Israeli cauliflower couscous.  I loved the bread and thought the couscous was just ok.

First pasta dish that we orders was the pumpkin squash stuffed tortelli w/ a butter sage sauce along with asparagus.  The tortelli was cooked perfectly and the pumpkin squash filling was damn tasty.  The asparagus added a nice texture to the tortelli.

Second pasta dish was the spaghetti chitarra alla norcina, basically a sausage and freshly shaved truffle pasta.  I love the table side shaving of truffles and once I saw the sausage and truffle combination, I knew we would order this dish.  Once again the spaghetti was cooked al dente and the sausage and truffles were a perfect match.  IIRC a light cream sauce brings all these awesome ingredients together.  Highly recommended pasta dish if available.

Lasagna verde, as others have mentioned probably one of their signature pasta dishes available.  I&#39;m not a huge lasagna person but will have to admit this was pretty tasty.  Loved the crispy spinach leaves served along side this spinach lasagna pasta layered in between beef and veal ragu.  Another must order dish if it&#39;s your first time dining here.  

As we sat there having just finished 3 pasta dishes and seeing the waiters carve up porchetta for the table behind us, we decided to order another pasta dish to share.  There was one dish at Beatia that we both loved so we decided to order the roasted veal bone marrow w/ saffron gnocchetti.  All I can say is damn was this tasty!!!  The bone marrow was perfectly seasoned and drizzled with a little bit of aged balsamic vinegar to help cut some of the oil from the marrow.  The saffron gnocchetti was simply amazing.  Scrape off the marrow and mix with the saffron gnocchetti for probably one of the best pasta dishes I have ever had!  I hope they have this dish the next time I come as I may just order two for myself!

We finished the meal off with their panna cotta and their version of chocolate crostata.  The desserts were good but the pastas stole the show, especially the bone marrow gnocchetti.  

We have already made reservations to head back to try their entrees.  Service was good as this place gets packed.  Well worth the trip out West to dine at one of the best Italian restaurants in LA."

Sea urchin linguine: not only did the supposedly buttery flavour of the sea urchin didn&#39;t come through, the dish was tasted fishy and was served lukewarm. 

Pork blood sausage: I tend to steer clear from intestines and pork blood, but boy this pork blood sausage was a lovely surprise! I&#39;m so glad Mr L. ordered it because I wouldn&#39;t have ordered it myself.

Branzino : It was voted as the best in town according to our waiter. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything spectacular about it. The fish was fresh though

Lasagna: another &#34;best in town&#34; dish according to the waiter. Me A and Mr S who dined with me both seemed to think this is their favourite dish of the the night. I wasn&#39;t too impressed by how it was served lukewarm though

Profiteroles: it&#39;s just a regular cream puff with vanilla ice cream and chocolate glaze"

Parking: Valet, unless you can find street parking.

For party of two, this is what we ordered:
Their menu changes frequently (mostly their specials) and It&#39;s essential to put in your order quickly. Depending on the time, they can run out of some of the ingredients and you can&#39;t order some of the dishes. It happened to us :(

Roasted bell peppers, fresh burrata, extra virgin olive oil and balsamic ($16)
Very refreshing. Burrata is fresh! Nice dish to start off the meal.

Roasted veal Bone marrow saffron gnocchetti asparagus, aged balsamic vinegar ($16)
Really enjoyed the dish. Gnocchetti wasn&#39;t too heavy &amp; compliment with the Bone Marrow &amp; asparagus. We devoured this dish! 

Lasagna verde &#34;omaggio nonna elvira&#34; spinach pasta besciamella beef &amp; veal ragu ($18)
I&#39;m a big lasagna fan!  Enjoyed every bite!

Risotto ai frutti di mare ($30). Comes with seafood. I would say this was my least favorite dish from everything we ordered. Nothing really stood out to me about this dish. Also, I&#39;m used to my risotto&#39;s texture to be much softer, like well-cooked rice but the texture seemed a bit chewier than I expected.

Either way, service was great &amp; I enjoyed my experience at the restaurant. The ambiance is perfect for a date night! YES! expect me back! I&#39;m excited to try their other dishes on the menu!"

With it&#39;s shared valet service and out door &#39;patio&#39;. When you finally recognize your destination you&#39;re greeted by what I can only describe as organize chaos. This place is definitely small and the walkways are very narrow. 

Typically you expect a maitre&#39;d or a well outfitted podium at a place advertised as &#39;4.5 Stars there dollar signs, located on Beverly Blvd.&#39; Instead you are greeted with a lovely gal in her summer dress trying to find a balance between the reservations list and a place to stand with all the servers, customers, and tables/chairs. And you soon realized why you waited almost a month to get a convenient 7:30pm dinner reservation on Saturday night.

This place is TINY and completely adorable in every way. Whether this is so or not, it FEELS as if this is the evolution of a small family owned Italian restaurant adapting to DTLA. And the ambiance is perfect. 

Is it crazy, yes. Will people bump into you.. probably. Do you feel sorry for the poor couple sitting at the first table by the front door, for sure. Hopefully they&#39;re not on their first date.

Angelini Osteria, 5 stars. Squid Salad Appetizer - dare I say one of the best I&#39;ve had at an Italian restaurant. Truffle pasta - yes. Actually if you&#39;re a pasta lover I&#39;d get one appetizer and two pastas. The entries were traditional, we had the duck. There are only a few words that can be used to describe the food.. Delicious, perfect, definitely deserving of its 4.5 stars as testimony from the other reviews."

I have actually been meaning to write a review for a while, and after my last meal there I am more than inspired.

I love fish, but usually sword fish comes out dry, I am not sure if it was an appetizer or under what category but the sword fish came out on a small plate sliced and so delicious I never knew a sword fish could melt in your mouth like butter. I also had the Vermont quail appetizer and it was to die for, perfectly proportioned and did not interfere with the main course. For the mean I had the duck breast with spinach and again cooked to perfection!!!

My guy ordered an incredible eggplant penne, and our guest had a salted fish which the waiter comes out and takes off the salt and nicely transfers it onto your plate...

I was plenty satisfied and unfortunately there was no room for dessert :-) so I have nothing to say about that category today, but it all looks so yummy, next time for sure! I also forgot to mention that I was able to try a deep fried eggplant appetizer that came out in a small dish in a sauce that was so good, everything is so amazing, this should be nominated as a five-star restaurant, as I eat out often and this is hands down my favorite restaurant!

Buon Mangiando!!

I have been meaning to try Angelini Osteria for a while now since Bestia&#39;s head chef Ori Menashe was a chef de cuisine at Angelini for five yrs. So this was not only a Father&#39;s Day celebratory dinner but a battle between two of the most well known Italian restaurants in LA. 

The four of us tried several dishes and we all agreed that the pastas stood out amongst everything, that and the octopus appetizer. For pasta we ordered the lasagna, osso bucco agnolotti, sea urchin linguini, and the sausage truffle spaghetti. Angelini strikes a perfect balance in making a dish luxurious but not cloying. We each had our favorites, but the standouts were the truffle spaghetti and agnolotti. I have never actually eaten discernible pieces of truffle until now, it had always been in the forms of oils or minuscule speckles. But for $45 you get a mountain of paper thin truffle shavings performed at table side, a feast for the eyes and palate. The truffles shine in this dish, complimented by creaminess and sausage in the background. The agnolotti was another table favorite, hearty and delicate at the same time. The braised short rib filling was robust and flavorful wrapped in a dainty parcel. This was my favorite.

Hands down our favorite appetizer was the octopus! Perfect texture, not chewy but bouncy and succulent, everyone loved this and they served a generous portion of it too. My mom and I quite liked the chicken liver, but the BF and my dad didn&#39;t care for the texture or dill flavor. Branzino was another winner, very tender and yummy. Things I wouldn&#39;t order again: Salumi board not worth the price and the Porchetta was way too salty. 

So what&#39;s the verdict? I can definitely see Angelini&#39;s influence in some of Bestia&#39;s most popular dishes i.e. sea urchin linguini and the sausage pasta. But Bestia gives these a modern update in flavor. Let&#39;s just say that I&#39;d gladly go back to either of these any day of the week!"

They sat us in the bar seating in the back even though there was some empty tables. I ordered the Uni pasta, my usual, it took 15 minutes for the waiter to come and take our order, and it took over 30 minutes for the food to come out. My boyfriend likes simple food so every time we come we ask for them to make a pasta for him with just red spaghetti sauce. The waitress looked at us weird and kept questioning... JUST the red sauce???? like really? JUST... the red sauce? She said it just like that... with a really rude tone and straight face. The regular spaghetti they made for my bf every time we went there was first suggested by one of the waiters there that made us keep coming back. We are paying for it and asking for something very simple, why did she have to question us like that and repeat her self over 3 times as if we cant hear???? 

As for my uni pasta, the uni was bitter and the pasta was undercooked. -_-

My bf&#39;s order came out wrong, it was RAGU not a red sauce spaghetti... he didnt ask them to take it back since he was ALREADY embarrassed by the way the waitress was staring at him so rudely like he&#39;s asking for something weird when he was making a very simple request and we didn&#39;t ask them take the food back. I doubt we are ever coming back here. That lady needs to learn to be kind to customers."

The hostess is fabulous; talk about a sweetie! The restaurant is very small. So much so that I don&#39;t envy the employees because the poor people are on top of each other trying to shift around between taking orders, delivering orders, handling wine and drink requests, ect. 

You can tell that everything is made fresh because you do wait a while for your food. When it arrives it is delicious though. I only tried the pumpkin ravioli with sage butter but it was fantastic. Great flavor, just enough to satisfy, not too rich, the asparagus was nice and tender.

The man who recommended a wine to me did a great job; it really was perfect to my liking and my waiter was friendly. It&#39;s a lovely little place and definitely worth a trip out for dinner."

Legitimate, very authentic, Italian restaurant. It&#39;s exciting that it also happens to be in my neighborhood. But even if this place was on the other side of town, I would make it a point to go as often as I could. 

To start, the ambiance is classy yet chill, and not pretentious at all (nothing like the majority of restaurants in LA, in a good way). It&#39;s a small but bustling place, but the nice part is they aren&#39;t trying to rush you out. They want it to be an experience, with the wine, the food, the service. The service was excellent--waiter and sommelier were both attentive but not disruptive. 

We started with a bottle of Roche Barbera, which the sommelier helped us select. It was a nice start and complement to our meal. As for the food, we began our dinner with the octopus salad---A-MA-ZING. Best octopus I&#39;ve ever had. It was tender and had a nice, light flavor, with a crispy exterior. We also got the caprese burrata salad--delicious. the tomatoes were so ripe, the burrata was so creamy, and the small pieces of basil added a huge flavor. For dinner we had the lasagna (yes, I did see Giada say it was the  best thing she ever ate, so i had to try it)--and it blew me away. I am not even a fan of lasagna, but this was literally one of the best things I&#39;ve ever eaten. It was somehow light, the meat was so flavorful, and each bite melted in my mouth. My husband had the duck ragut pasta--also light and flavorful, but i did like the lasagna a bit more. 

We finished with the apple tart with vanilla gelato. Homemade, sweet (but not too sweet), a lot of apples, and just the perfect ending to our perfect meal. 

Bravo, Angelini Osteria. I&#39;m so happy I found you!"

- Spaghetti Chitarra all Norcina summer truffles &amp; parmigiano reggiano. Every bite of this pasta was a trip back to Italy.

Excellent pasta with sausage and shaved truffles. Good wine, delicious desserts, and cheerful waiters. What is nice is that they are donating a percentage of the bill to the Earthquake victims in Italy. However, I was very uncomfortable with the seating arrangements. The dining tables are too close together. My table was about 6 inches apart from the table to my left. Basically you could hear each other&#39;s conversations, and when the waiters pass the aisle they have to pass sideways. Perhaps, they can knock down the wall to their expresso bar and extend their dining area."

Coming back here again the other night made me realize how much I missed this place.  Although it has been a couple of years since I&#39;ve dined here, everything was spectacular and consistent as usual.  First, I love the atmosphere that can get pretty cozy in terms of space, but remains casually hip with no pressure.  Dress up or dress down you&#39;re good!  Service remains super efficient and you get a lot of attention from not just your waiter but from numerous supportive staff with really cool Italian accents :-).  Hey, that just makes this place even more authentic.  As for food, simply spectacular.  Every table starts with thin crispy flat bread accompanied by a farro starter dish which is so flavorful it could be an appetizer in itself.  The chopped salad was not your usual preparation which we loved and included cannellini beans and a delightful addition of pistachio.  And the pasta?  Unbelievable!  I went back to my former usual order, the Spaghetti Mancini alla Norma, which is still done al dente with the perfect degree of firmness on every bite.  My boyfriend ordered their incredible pasta with mushrooms and truffles which was so satisfying it was impossible to make that dish any better.  We closed out this wonderful meal with an Affogato al Caffe which was vanilla gelato literally drowned in a shot of espresso.  The caffeine kept me up all night, but what the hell, it was the perfect ending to an incredible meal.  Bravo Angelini Osteria!  It&#39;s time I become a regular again!"

We were a party of 3, with no reservation. Called around 5:30 on a Sunday to see if we could get in, and we were told there would be room at the counter area. We arrived and were seated promptly.

We shared...

SEA URCHIN PASTA: I was so excited to try this one, and to share with our visitor who never had uni. Even as we ordered, the waitress commented that they run out of it quickly, bumping the hype level up another notch. The uni tongue itself was fresh, and provided a nice creaminess to the dish. But the flavor of the dish was overpowered by a fishy clam flavor in my opinion. If you&#39;re very into clam, however, this may be the perfect dish for you.

LASAGNA VERDE: Recommended by the waitress (and admired by Food Network&#39;s Giada apparently). It was bland to me. The sauce might have been interesting, but there was far too little of it in ours to come through in each bite, especially when I compare it to some of the pictures on here!

BRANZINO: Also recommended by the waitress (and this time admired by Wolfgang Puck). Watching the fillet process was fun. The seabass itself was well-prepared. Great tenderness and light flavor. It went very well with the lemony sauce as well. Probably my favorite part of the meal. But that&#39;s where this dish ends. The vegetables and mashed potatoes are a complete afterthought. Both very bland. I was particularly disappointed in the mashed potatoes which had no noticeable seasoning or fat. It tasted as if someone just mashed up some boiled potatoes and called it a side. I should also note that one person in our party got a surprise bone in a piece of the fish, which is never fun.

NUTELLA CARROT CAKE: As a fan of nutella, vanilla, and carrot cake, I thought, &#34;What could be better?!&#34; Oh, how wrong I was. The carrot cake was oddly dry and unattractive, and you guessed it, once again bland. It was completely overpowered by the nutella. Since I could eat plain nutella straight out of the jar, I still finished it, but obviously regretted the purchase.

ESPRESSO CROSTATA: Technically, this dessert seemed to work much better than the nutella carrot cake. The flavors went okay together, although the coffee crust was a little too bitter for my pallet.

Seating is very tight as others have mentioned. My chair was certainly bumped a few times, since I was at the corner of the counter seating. I probably ended the meal a foot away from where I began eating! But they typically gave a quick half-smile and apology whenever they bumped me. In fact, one time I even got a full smile and a shoulder touch! So if you&#39;re into tall, handsome Italian guys smiling at you, I might even recommend the counter seating!"

For a $$$, I would expect pretty top-notch attention but this was not the case. Simone was our server and here is how my Friday night went:

- she sat us down and as she poured water in the glasses, spilled water on the table setting and had to re-set 2 of the 5 seats
- we asked for a wine list, which she brought over but never came back to take the order; one of the managers saw us being indecisive so he helped us out
- throughout the evening, she never came to ask us how the food was or if we needed anything else; we had to keep flagging her down or ask the manager to call her over
- we had to ask for bread refills at least twice until it was brought over
- we ordered a bottle of wine, which is kept chilled at the bar; we had to flag her down to refill the glass and it felt like she topped off the glass until there was no more wine so she wouldn&#39;t have to return

As for the food, the grilled octopus appetizer was delicious! It was crispy on the outside but juicy and soft inside. 

The branzino was quite a presentation! It comes out crusted in salt and herbs and then broken out at the table. It was flaky and flavorful. 

The apple tart was super buttery, slightly warm, and perfectly paired with the vanilla gelato. 

The disappointments were the seafood risotto (rice was way undercooked), duck ragu tagliatelle special (too salty), and the espresso (had a bunch coffee bean grinds)."

Without hesitation he said Angelini Osteria. Done. I called to make reservations but they said the time slot from 7-9 is usually booked way in advance but that we can try walking in. 

We arrive at 8 on a Wednesday and the place is packed. We asked the hostess for a table for 4 and she tells us she has a pizza bar in the back. We walk in and just laugh. There is a little kitchen bar. You are basically sitting in the kitchen, watching the baker make the free table breads. We were starving so we couldn&#39;t really complain about the ambiance. 

We ordered the:
Grilled Calamari - Amazing. Light. 
2 Risotto Acquerello  - Not a huge fan of this dish. Was bland for me. 
Lasagna Verde - Holy Mother. This dish was amazing. With crispy spinach on top. It was heavenly. My dish was the clear winner. 
Uni Pasta - My friend had this dish and he really enjoyed it. 
Bottle of White Wine

One server almost knocked down my plate because the table was just that close to the walk way! The food was bland. Ordered the lasagna and uni pasta. Lasagna was nothing special, uni pasta was like I said, bland. However, the tuna tartare appetizer was excellent. Fresh tuna on top of thick warm toast with salted arugula bedded on top.

Shit-talking aside, I enjoyed my meal IMMENSELY. Everything was excellent, but a couple of dishes were particularly memorable. The lamb chops were ridiculously juicy and flavorful. They were so good that they might give Evvia&#39;s version a run for its money. The agnolotti was also phenomenal. The ossobucco filling was so tender that it melted in my mouth. This may have been one of the top pasta dishes I&#39;ve ever tasted.

Unfortunately, they ran out of uni pasta during my visit. I flirted with the idea of returning two days later to try this dish, but couldn&#39;t justify eating pasta twice in one weekend. Instead, I just drank my green juice and you know...shit."

We didn&#39;t have reservations but they were able to accommodate us on the adorable lil enclosed outdoor terrace.
By the time we were half way thru our meal there were about 20 people all congregated outside waiting to be seated....so YES we got lucky lol
Carpaccio as antipasto; sooooo buttery and delicious. 
Skipped the pasta course and went straight for the Vitello (al milanese) which simply means breaded hee hee. This veal chop was HUGE and it was so good I ate it ALL...i rarely do that when it&#39;s that much but it was soooooo good I just kept eating till it was GONE.  The fried zucchini that came with it were pretty good,  not spectacular, and I didn&#39;t try the mashed potatoes. 
Dolci:  OF COURSE i had to have the raspberry Panna Cotta...simply TO DIE FOR. 
Coffee wise i finished off the meal with a decaf double espresso with a lil milk on the side; considering it was decaf it was not bad lol.
CANNOT WAIT to return to this spot....thank God it&#39;s right around the corner from my house;-)"

However, Joann D told me about the uni pasta here, so I had to check it out!  Angelini Osteria is on Beverly near Fairfax in the Fairfax, diagonally across from previously reviewed Milk.

For lunch, we started w/ the insalata di polpo ($18 | octopus salad), and of course I had the linguine w/ uni for my entrée ($30).  She had the veal ($30 | sorry, no pic).  For dessert, we shared the apple tart alla millanese ($10 | w/ vanilla ice cream).

First of all, the octopus was better compared to previously reviewed Cecconi (and I rated Cecconi&#39;s 5+++).  It came on a bed of peppery arugula and sweet cherry tomatoes on the side.  The two flavors helped balance the savory taste of the octopus.  All of my umami senses were touched w/ this dish:  5++++ Stars.  On the other hand, the uni pasta was very good, but not over the top like EMC (sorry Joann!).  The pasta was perfectly cooked al dente, but there was one piece of uni and the price was $30.  In comparison, EMC&#39;s version is $19:  4 Stars.  Thirdly, my lunch companion really liked her veal (she is a  carnivore).  She generally doesn&#39;t eat much, but she killed her dish:  4 Stars.  Lastly, the dessert was her idea, but I am not going to complain.  It reminded me of the apple crostada at Maggianos, only much better.  The only thing that would have made it 5 stars was some caramel sauce.  However, I like caramel, so I am a bit biased:  4 Stars.

Regarding the ambiance, osteria means tavern, and this is a small, quaint place.  It would be excellent for a date or business lunch.  There are a few outdoor tables in the event you want to dine al fresco:  4 Stars.  Secondarily, the service from Gino our waiter was fantastic.  He was very informative, super attentive, and a pleasure to have as our waiter:  5 Stars.

I would enjoy returning for dinner to try the bone marrow, ossobuco, or another pasta.  The food is good to excellent, the ambiance is good for date night, and the service is outstanding."

I&#39;ve been here a dozen times or so and it has never disappointed me.  If they are serving chicken livers, you&#39;d be wise to order them. Double for duck breast, served rare.  This is, in my not so humble opinion, the best Italian in Los Angeles.  Enjoy."

Nestled in the center of Los Angeles, this adorable Italian restaurant is seriously worthy of a visit. Cozy, intimate and simply delicious, it was like we took a quick trip to Italy. 

What we ordered: 
1. Burrata caprese salad - melts it your mouth
2. Grilled octopus salad - tenderly grilled to perfection; it was a fan fave
3. Bone marrow - oh em drool! I always thought the bone marrow dish at Bestia was the best in LA but this one tops it! Love the hint of balsamic vinegar to cut the fatty (but delicious) taste.
4. Squid ink linguine with shrimp and lobster - it wasn&#39;t on the menu but we asked for it and SO glad we did. You can&#39;t see what you&#39;re eating but who cares? It&#39;s freakin&#39; phenoms. 
5. Lasagna verde - it was certainly delicious but next time, I&#39;d probably go for something else. 

Perfect to wash it down with a glass of Chianti. 

Service is great, staff is friendly and helpful and though it&#39;s buzzing like the trendiest restaurant in LA, it still has a familiar sense of a mom and pop&#39;s shop! 

Loved it and will definitely be back to try the UNI PASTA!!! (Sadly my friends didn&#39;t like uni... I know... I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s wrong with them either...)"

Their truffle pasta was pretty damn good as well. The waiter drowned the pasta with truffle shavings to the point where I even felt guilty and sorry for the owner with how much truffle was used. I would get the octopus salad for starters. 

I don&#39;t do many reviews on Yelp because quite frankly my time is worth $$$$ an hour (I am an obnoxiously arrogant attorney). But every once awhile a place does something so damn well you want to give it its due."

We were able to be squeezed in last minute for our small party, and how grateful we are for that! The service was great, the food was great, it&#39;s a fairly small, intimate restaurant. It has that homey vibe and feel. But on to the food...

- Branzino - This was so good. It&#39;s a whole fish prepared in a crust of sea salt and carved table side. The fish is tender, salty, and delicious. The greens are delicious, and the mashed potatoes are creamy and perfect. 
- Agnolotti di Ossobuco - the agnolotti is thin, delicate, filled with a delicious veal. Quite possibly my favorite dish of the night.
- Grilled prime rib eye - Perfectly medium rare, seasoned crust, perfectly tender. It comes with a tasty salad with shaved parmesan. 
- Panna cotta - This would be the second contender for my favorite dish, and I&#39;m not even a dessert lover. The panna cotta is perfectly set, with a subtle sweetness that&#39;s perfect after dinner. The raspberry sauce and fruit perfectly complements it as well.

All in all, an excellent dinner, worthy of its accolades."

On the contrary, Angelini has a ton of above average choices on the menu like their lasagna which is out of this world.  They also have some pricier choices like $100 plate of pasta with truffles?  Service is superb and they give you delicious bread, couscous salad and a tasting of a special dish &#34;compliments of the chef&#34; along with your meal.

We went with a group of friends. Everyone picked something different from the menu. Everything was okay. But we were shocked at the very small portion sizes. Especially in light of the price tags. While the lasagna and lamb chops were the best options our group had selected, I don&#39;t think there is a justification for the price given the very small portion sizes. We had ordered an appetizer an entree and dessert and still left slightly unsatisfied. I don&#39;t think I will be back.  

Valet parking available but there&#39;s also ample street parking. 

The tables are positioned way way too close to one another. Every time our neighbors to the front or back needed to get up, we were forced to nearly also get up. How awkward..."

Whenever i come here, i ask for patio seating because its extremely loud inside. The place itself is very pretty and small, and it will definitely get noisy.

We came here for lunch and there were a good amount of people here seeing that it was mid-day on a weekday. They brought a complimentary cous cous (?) salad, vegetable soup and crispy bread as appetizers to share - which were all decently yummy. 

The uni spaghetti wasn&#39;t on the menu but our waiter was super accommodating and asked the chef to make it for us because they only have a limited amount of uni to make it per day I guess. In addition to that we ordered the summer truffle pasta to share and they were both really good.

Met up with my &#34;gubby&#34; (gay hubby- we aren&#39;t really married, just a good, loving friendship. Props to my friend Cat for the word) for dinner here on a Thursday night and had such a beautiful experience here.   Food and service were perfect and made for an overall wonderful experience.

I originally made dinner reservations for 7pm, but was running late from work and luckily the restaurant accommodated pushing back our reservations to 7:30pm without hassle.  I arrived and the restaurant was packed.  The restaurant is small, so seating is elbow to elbow with a lot of chatter.  It&#39;s a little difficult to have conversation, as I had to always lean forward to hear my gubby or ask him to speak louder -just FYI.  Our Italian waiter was attentive, checked on us periodically (but not too much as to seem too eager), made suggestions and added to a beautiful dining experience.  

Now the FOOD... AMAZING!!!! I got dinner recommendations from a woman, dining alone, besides me... I am soo glad I went with her suggestion.  For dinner, I had the whole branzino roasted in sea salt, aromatic herbs, sautéed mix vegetables and mashed potatoes $36 -had small bones in it. Although, presentation is marvelous! The waiter prepares/serves the fish to you ...I was very entertained.  OH, for an appetizer we had the sautéed scallops, mushrooms, aged balsamico $20 -PERFECT!  Texture wasn&#39;t rubbery, soft and the mushrooms complemented perfectly.

Nothing fancy, not at all stuffy, but the food is just consistently good!  

We came for our annual truffle pilgrimage, and this year dragged along a few willing victims.  The table started by sampling three of their truffle dishes: scrambled eggs with truffles, tagliolini with truffles, and agnolotti with truffles.  The eggs were sublime, a perfect, custardy and fluffy texture, and the perfect vehicle for the truffles.  The tagliolini was also excellent, clearly freshly made in house and dressed with just enough of something (butter?) but not so much as to prevent the truffles from shining through.  The agnolotti were also very good, although I would recommend skipping the truffles (gasp!).  No really, the agnolotti are superb, delicate and filled with a fantastic osso bucco filling, but they overpowered the truffle and when you are paying that much for truffles, you don&#39;t want anything getting in the way!

For dinner, I had the porchetta - a beautiful pork butt that had been rolled with a delightful filling and carved table side.  They topped it with just a touch of pork au jus, and when I asked, they willingly gave me several nice pieces of pork crackling to go with my dish.  Outstanding!

Two of our party had the lasagna verde, a very rich but delicious version of the Italian classic made with a sinful béchamel sauce.  A couple of other people had the whole branzino baked in salt, which is always both a delight to see served and a delicious dish.  The only miss was the duck ragu, which wasn&#39;t bad but just wasn&#39;t nearly as outstanding as the other dishes.

Understandably, this place is always packed.  But somehow the servers still were attentive throughout the meal, and you never got the sense that they were rushed nor that they were rushing you."

Definitely one of the best Italian restaurants in the area. I had this place bookmarked for quite awhile before I finally got a chance to taste the Italian goodness. First of all, the bread. As the bread was delivered to the table I noticed it wasn&#39;t the thick crusty bread that most Italian restaurants serve. The bread was thin and crispy, and the seasonings were impeccable...and the best part: it didn&#39;t fill you up before you got a chance to eat your meal. We ordered the Lasagna verde &#34;Omaggio Nonna Elvira&#34; and the Spaghetti alla Norcina. WOW. Both dishes were so delicious there wasn&#39;t a single thing I would change. The lasagna was creamy on the inside with spinach and sausage veal in every bite. The melted cheese on top was not overpowering like most lasagnas and the green noodles were cooked al dente and to perfection. The dish was the perfect size, not too big and not to small, and very filling. My favorite was the Spaghetti alla Norcina. I am a lover of all truffle; but the black truffle melted in with the spaghetti was beyond my expectations. Per recommendation of our waiter, we ordered this dish that was filled with amazing flavors of sausage and truffle in every bite, Again, the pasta was cooked to perfection and not overcooked like most pasta dishes. All in all, the seasoning, flavors, presentations, and simplicity of the dishes were perfect. Based on the food I would rate this restaurant a five. There is also a nice wine selection that can be paired with almost every dish on the menu.

The restaurant itself was a bit crowded. The first thing I noticed walking into the restaurant was the hostess. She was pushed into this tiny corner in the front of the restaurant with a little chair and a not so happy attitude. Although  we had reservations for a particular time, my party still had to wait approximately thirty minutes before being seating because our table &#34;was not ready&#34;. The restaurant is crowded to say the least. The tables are very close to one another, not allowing much moving or leg room. On a Sunday evening, the restaurant was at full capacity and a bit claustrophobic. Nonetheless, the waiters do a great job of maintaining the ambiance and mood. Although I did order a second glass of wine halfway through my meal...it never got delivered to the table. I blame this on the busy-ness of the restaurant and did not utter a word to the waiter as I had already finished my food before I had a chance to complain.I would absolutely recommend this restaurant for an amazing Italian experience but be prepared for a bit of overcrowded-ness."

The ahi tuna and the beef carpaccio are excellent appetizers. I also remember the lamb chops and the Branzino both great choices too. The lasagna however is still my favorite! 

The service is unmatched. Also, it&#39;s not very hard to find a table they don&#39;t make a big deal out of booking a day prior like some restaurants do, however I highly recommend booking earlier as the weekends can get packed.

DAMN.

This place, with its 4.5 stars, doesn&#39;t disappoint.

Service is absolutely golden. Attentive, cute, warm, personal, friendly, but not at all pushy. This place does fill up quick even for lunch, so make your reservation and plan ahead. There&#39;s plenty of street parking around the residential area block and valet parking for $5 in front of the place.

Amuse-bouche to start: Pickled vegetables that entices your appetites.
Their bread IS SO AMAZING. Baked with rosemary, it smells so herbal and is so crispy and light. Almost like potato chip, but rosemary bread.

Roasted Bone Marrow (5/5):
I personally think this is better than the Bestia version. The balsamic vinegar in the bone marrow reduces the oily and greasy feeling you can taste from the bone marrow. Amazingly paired and flavored.

Homemade Spaghetti Chitarra alla Norcina (4.7/5):
Wish the sausage comes in bigger chunks. Ha. The Spaghetti Chitarra itself is really, really good. It&#39;s chewy and you know it&#39;s freshly made. They&#39;re very generous with the amount of truffle they put in. This is an amazing dish.

Duck Breast - medium (4.5/5):
The meat is juicy and tender, yet the skin is crisp. The fat between the skin and the meat binds the flavors together instead of creating a nauseous feeling of greasy food. 

Profiteroles (4/5):
They use really good quality vanilla ice cream. It&#39;s really smooth. The chocolate is a little bitter and goes well with the profiteroles. Well done.

This is an amazing experience and definitely one of the best places in L.A."

For such a &#34;high end&#34; $$$ Italian restaurant, the location and space is absolutely terrible. I came here for a special occasion on a Saturday night, and the only table available for us was sitting literally right next to another couple less than a foot away, barely enough space for anyone to go between the tables. I&#39;ve been to a couple places especially the gastropubs in downtown where the space has been awkward but this by far takes the grand prize, as the first upscale restaurant I&#39;ve been to in mid city that offers this experience. 

Other than that, the duck ragu tagliatelle was exquisite and cooked to perfection and the lasagna verde was also very savory as well, no complaints there for the food. The service was also very amiable and our waitress was very knowledgeable on all their dishes and had good recommendations. The parking unfortunately is not the greatest since there&#39;s only street parking and is located in a very central location, but we only had to walk a block so it wasn&#39;t a tedious parking experience like most times I try to park on Beverly or Melrose on a weekend. 

All in all, Osteria feels like a bit overrated for what it is and doesn&#39;t really reflect the experience I was expecting for such a favorably rated restaurant. Bottom line, I liked my experience with the food itself and the service but I would prefer to pick another restaurant over Angelini Osteria simply for a better atmosphere and a more ample relaxed space for a special intimate night."

I should be told what I should and shouldn&#39;t do. Taste is subjective... Anyways, willing to over look that. Tiramisu for dessert I really enjoyed. Portions are smaller for what they charge.

PARKING:
Only valet. 

AMBIANCE:
Very tiny restaurant but it is so cute inside. Tables are pretty squished together but it makes it more intimate. You definitely have to make a reservation here and plan on eating here a good week ahead, this place gets booked QUICKLY!

FOOD:
Delicious. I dream of their lasagna verde. I found this place on the tv show &#34;Best Thing I Ever Ate&#34;. Giada DeLaurentis proclaimed that their lasagna verde was the best she has ever had and right then I knew I had to try it too.

The lasagna verde is simple but executed absolutely perfectly. The bolognese was rich and deep in flavors but not overly powerful. The meat (beef and veal) was really hot and melted in your mouth. The cheese was ooey and gooey and the the verde added a great crisp texture to the dish. Seriously, the best lasagna I have ever had in my life. 5/5

I also got the uni pasta which was plate a decadent uni and noodles. You would think that this dish would get heavy quickly but it is not. The noodles were chewy and the sauce was rich but still not too strong that it tired your palate. 5/5

SERVICE:
Almost as good as their food. Everyone is so nice here. I can&#39;t wait to come back!"

You&#39;re sitting right next to complete strangers and you won&#39;t be able to avoid hearing their conversations. 

Boyfriend brought me here for my birthday, I was really excited to try their famous Uni Pasta but sadly, it failed to meet my expectations. Sure, there was uni, it was creamy, and the pasta was perfectly al dente, but it was way too salty. 

The Seafood Risotto on the other hand was much more enjoyable. Fresh seafood, soft risotto, and a light tomato sauce. 

We also got the Profiteroles dessert which was pretty good. But I mean, it&#39;s hard to go wrong with chocolate covered puff pastries and gelato. 

I&#39;ll probably give this place another shot, but I&#39;ll be trying their other dishes which look delectable. Not the Uni Pasta."

The veal chop is a luscious piece of meat perfectly seasoned and enough to fill a growing man... I usually dislike the gamey taste of veal, but here it tastes like buttery piece of pork. 
The branzino was also a masterpiece with the amazing didplay at the tableside cracking the fish out of its she&#39;ll. 
My favorite dishes are by far the uni pasta and the octopus appetizer. The octopus is perfectly seared and moist with a nice bite, but not rubbery. The uni pasta is full of uni-goodness with every bite. Nom nom nom"

No struggling actors serving as waiters.
No &#34;craft cocktails&#34; being peddled.
No &#34;hot spot&#34; vibe.
Not a place to &#34;see and be seen&#34;.
No Wannabe Hollywood morons crowding the front door in their latest Justin Bieber look-a-like outfits.
All things which are all too common in this neighborhood.



This is a real, authentic, European/Italian dining experience where the center piece is the authentic Italian food and delicious wine.  A breath of fresh air in an LA restaurant scene built firmly on crafting some sort of fraudulent appearance or experience by some &#34;restauranteur&#34; who owns 12 restaurants/craft cocktail bars looking to do nothing but rip you the F off.  The food in these places is ehh to decent but the money you spend is certainly lining the pockets of the &#34;restauranteurs&#34; behind these fly by night operations.

Everything from the minute we sat down was nice, traditional and well-executed.  The authentic Italian wait staff and sommelier made me feel like there is hope in this &#34;rinse/repeat&#34; restaurant scene of digging up the &#34;next best thing&#34; to rip off the residents of LA  who seem to struggle to find something &#34;cutting edge&#34; to waste their money on.

We had the octopus appetizer, caprese burrata appetizer, the lasagna and the duck tagliatelle ragout--all were EXCELLENT.  Not heavy, not overly salty, not overpowering--just well done, light, delicate and 5 stars across the board.

The highlights for me were the burrata--some of the best I have ever had and the lasagna--was beyond flavorful, complex and light and smooth at the same time.

Well done, Angelini.  Don&#39;t change.  Be the beacon of light in the stormy night that is the LA restaurant scene."

The food:

Black Truffle Spaghetti: Can you say amazing? Im not a big fan of fresh speghetti but everything worked so well together. This is my first time eating Fresh shaved black truffles and it was life changing. 5/5
Lasagna Verde: Full of basil and meat. My wife loved it
Gnoccheti w/ Bone Marrow: The complexity of the flavors and everything just balanced each other out. 4/5

Being raised in an Italian home, Italians often embraced the foods from other regions and continents because they were at the center of trade during the crusades. Angelini&#39;s is a throwback as they have marinara based entrees, but also, they take other styles a food types and blend them with succulent combinations. Some of the entrees and specials are unique and some are traditional. All of them are excellent. I&#39;ve had the lasagna, steak, and veal, and all are top shelf.

The seating is a little cozy, as in tight, but the service is excellent, and the wine choices match the excellence of the food and service.

I love that they are open late, and I can get almost anything I&#39;m craving. In the past, my favorite meals have been the CK burger deal with a veggie patty, cheese fries, vegan sandwich, caesar salad with salmon, mango tropics smoothie, hummus avocado wrap, and cheese pizza. The food is always fresh and delicious. I never have to wait more than 15 minutes for my order, even during busy hours.

Recently I went vegan, so my options are very limited now. I would love if they could offer more vegan-friendly dishes, because I know a lot of other vegan locals who would love to eat at Central Kitchen. Also, I think they should offer some type of deal for Lorenzo residents such as free delivery, I don&#39;t ever want to pay $4 for someone to ride up an elevator to deliver my food, but sometimes its hard to leave my apartment if I&#39;m busy doing homework."

There were a couple vegan-friendly options, which I appreciate and I got the stir fry tofu bowl. It really wasn&#39;t worth my money in my opinion - $9 or so for mostly brown rice, with not a ton of veggies on top. And it really wasn&#39;t a stir fry like I was expecting, more like steamed veggies thrown on top of rice. I didn&#39;t notice any teriyaki sauce or whatever was supposed to be used in the stir fry so I added sriracha sauce on top.

I&#39;ve gotten their BBQ chicken omelette, sometimes it it stuffed full and delicious, other times, it&#39;s smothered in way too much BBQ sauce, and once I found a random bone in the chicken... Not a huge deal, but I don&#39;t think Central Kitchen is super reliable in terms of food. However, I must say, I&#39;m a fan of their Heath Bar Toffee Cookies and Breakfast Egg sandwiches. I&#39;ve never had any bad experiences with either of those. 

Overall, it&#39;s very standard food -- burgers, pizza, etc -- and I think they could definitely work on consistency and making their food more unique and memorable.

It was a really nice gesture and just another example of their wonderful customer service. CK relies on customer loyalty, and I&#39;ve always felt like they really do want their customers to be happy.

My favorite things to order are the salmon, pizza, teriyaki chicken bowl, soups, and my bf likes the pasta too. However, I stopped ordering the salmon because I find they always overcook it so it gets pretty dry.

The location is good and parking is great since it is a weekend parking is free. Walking to the Kitchen was beautiful walking through the housing area with its water feature. We ordered breakfast items and though the portions are big the food was sub par at best. I ordered the waffles and they were burnt on the edges and hard as a rock and tasted like cardboard, no taste at all. The bacon was good but for a side of bacon you only get 2 pieces. The breakfast sandwich however was good and the pancakes though you got a large portion was not that tasty either I believe they use the same batter for the waffles.

For the burgers, which are $8-10, I had to drown it in random sauces from my apartment just to make the taste bearable.

They said to wait for 10  minutes, so they could make a new one.  After 15 minutes, I go up to ask them how much longer it would be, and they didn&#39;t even start making my pizza (they forgot).

I was there for lunch to meet a friend and I was eating here after long. I called for the grilled cheese and a bowl of tomato basil soup.

Thank gosh Central Kitchen got their vegan sandwich. I eat it about 2 times a week and its healthy and delicious. 

The only problem is sometimes the cooks put &#34;pesto&#34; on the vegan sandwich instead of the &#34;pesto vegenaise&#34;. The pesto is not vegan because it contains cheese so to avoid this mishap I always order the pesto vegenaise on the side so I can be sure it is indeed pesto vegenaise and not pesto.

The pepper and sausage penne was good, and they put garlic on my broccolini so that was nice. Overall a solid experience. Also, the serve your own water is nice and they have the good crushed ice. I probably won&#39;t be back but that&#39;ll be  because of the Lorenzo, not Central Kitchen."

It was our first time and my brother and I both loved it! Ordered chicken teriyaki bowls and they were awesome. Sauce was so good &amp; not too heavy. Full of fresh, perfectly steamed veggies, and so cheap! For the quality, and portion size I totally recommend it, so worth it. The Brussel sprouts are also BOMB do yourself a favor and try them ASAP, a little hint of sweetness and omg yum! Can&#39;t wait to order again."

My mother, sisters and I went in this past Saturday for brunch since Jack n Joe&#39;s nearby was closed and after seeing the reviews on-line we decided to give it a try. We all ordered brunch meals and headed to sit down in the restaurant. The gentleman (or not so gentle), delivered our food in a very rude manner. He did not greet us and when placing the food on our table, he plopped my mother&#39;s plate on the table and there was syrup spilled all over my mother&#39;s pancakes, eggs, potatoes. They were soaking in syrup. I understand that spills can occur, however, he did not apologize, or even make the faintest remark regarding this incident which left my mother stunned (and myself). He was starting to walk away when my sister went on to say &#34;Excuse me, there is syrup that was spilled on her food&#34; to which he replied &#34;does she want more syrup?&#34; It was very condescending, and almost rhetorical since clearly she would not need more syrup, but rather a simple apology for spilling the syrup and offering to bring another plate. It was the most appalling comment I had heard. My mother baffled by this, left the situation as is. 

The food itself cannot be discussed negatively, I tried the waffles and they were decent.  It is all very well-priced but the service was absolutely terrible. Not sure if the gentleman was having a bad day, or just assumed that because we were brown that we could not speak English and that we would remain silent."

There&#39;s indoor or outdoor seating in an unique and amazing setting that you have to see to believe. Everything I&#39;ve tried is superb and made with love. Everything is reasonably priced and I always get the smoothies here. This time I tried blackened salmon with kale and mashed potatoes and it was on another level. All perfectly cooked with loads of flavor in every bite. To top it all off they&#39;ve added quality craft beers on tap. Was really happy about the Ballast Point especially. I could go on, but I think you get the point. You can&#39;t go wrong here!"

I canceled the order and because of their mistake I had $20 on hold for 3-5 business days. Thanks for wasting my time and for screwing up my account. Train your staff properly or at least offer people a discount when you screw up for next time. You just lost a customer and gained a bad review to boot.

Convenient dining was nothing like this! My quick, nearby meal typically consisted of a microwaved burrito via 7-11. So, parking&#39;s kind of a mystery if you&#39;ve never been here. The website recommends parking at the orthopedic center, which I did. Unfortunately I must have picked the most distant spot from the restaurant. A long walk later, I asked security, who directed me through the correct security doors. Went to order something, so many good choices! Finally decided on a chicken quesadilla. This beast was plump, stuffed with lots of chicken and cheese! So, I got the quesadilla and a drink for under ten bucks. A relative bargain. On some nights they have music in the dining courtyard. I went on a Wednesday to hear a familiar singer. Outside of the stressful, late night parking, I enjoyed my dinner here. Given that it&#39;s kinda far for me, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d specifically go here to just eat, but for a meal and show, it&#39;s pretty nice."

I had the &#39;Pesto Chicken Sandwich&#39; last time and it was made to order. Also, it was pretty good.

In the mornings, CK workers set up a little stand that sells simple breakfast items and coffee next to where students wait for the shuttle. How thoughtful of them.

One would expect &#34;student food&#34; and it was anything but. I had the Blackened Salmon which was as good or better than salmon I&#39;ve ordered in fine restaurants in L.A., although this was only $11 (vs. $25). My friend had the Grilled Steak Teriyaki bowl and her granddaughter ordered the Five Vegetable Pizza. These entrees were under $10. My friend&#39;s granddaughter told us that the restaurant has discounted dining plans, perfect for USC kids. The seating was comfortable - we sat outside even though it was an unusually cold day. They have heaters and a pleasant view of the courtyard and fountains. 

It is a quick service restaurant. You get a number on a stick and they bring you your  food. The kids working there seem to be very well trained.

To begin, This place has a little bit of everything...from dinner plates to fast food related foods, I&#39;m sure it has something everyone will find to their liking.  

Like some of the other reviews have said, you&#39;re probably not going to leave without feeling like you&#39;ve just spent a fortune on mediocre food.  It&#39;s rare to spend less than $11 per meal here. 

The quality of food can be improved..there seems to be a problem with food consistency here.  Not sure if it&#39;s because they have multiple cooks in the kitchen, but it seems every time I order something it&#39;s prepared differently.  Some days better than others.  

But besides the convenient, overpriced, mediocre food for Lorenzo residents, I&#39;m glad every one of the workers here are very nice and willing to help in any way they can.  You&#39;re always greeted by a smile anytime of the day and if there&#39;s a problem with the food, the employees are usually more than happy to accommodate you.

Spaghetti is bland, but salads on the other hand are fresh and tasty.

I swear they have the best pizza in L.A. --it has the tastiest crust, I don&#39;t know what they are doing but it&#39;s super yummy!  Their breakfast burrito is giant and I get it with extra cheese because its so good, and they have the best salads - also they have this interesting take on decadent french toast made with sourdough-- it&#39;s so good!   So I think I have covered every breakfast, lunch and dinner I&#39;ve had there.  I don&#39;t live in the Lorenzo, but it&#39;s worth it to get over there and visit Central Kitchen!"

I spotted a small sign that said &#34;parking in rear&#34; which is rare. We whipped in and saw the coolest little back patio, very festively lit up.  There were only a few patrons and it was quiet, nice music playing.

We were seated by the window but my companion wanted to sit outside. We moved and it was the best decision we made all day!

Sitting on Sunset Strip at sunset was super cool.  People watching was top notch! Lol. We met a local and her friend (and chihuahua) and had great conversation.

Food was great! Drinks were yummie. The only drawback to sitting outside is you get forgotten about after your entree is served. Needed more drinks and waited so long the urge passed. You know that feeling right?!  It also got chillier than we expected outside, still wouldn&#39;t trade the experience.

Ticket took awhile too.  But you know what? We were in Cali, on Sunset, on a very much needed vacation, so it&#39;s alright. We would definitely go back!"

Our server, Richard, came out with a water bowl and doggie treats for our dog and I think it was just so personable! He was so sweet and attentive. When we return my boyfriend said he is going to request Richard:) 

Our sushi tasted fresh! Great portions of fish to the other ingredients. Overall very enjoyable. We even asked for the menu back to get a little more. I recommend the Pacific roll. So much yellowtail and flavor. Can&#39;t wait to go back! And at the very end they brought us out a special treat!

It was refreshing and my glass was always filled. However the sushi was lacking (even paid for the fancy salmon with truffle oil.. But now looking back, shouldn&#39;t have gotten truffle oil on sushi). The portions were small and the wait took FOREVER when the restaurant was only half full. We asked to leave after our roll took over an hour to come out but right when we asked, the waitress found it sitting on the counter.  Gyoza tastes like it was just defrosted and fried. The spicy tuna crispy rolls were over fried and cold with minimal tuna on top.

It even started out rocky since it took fifteen minutes to even have someone notice us and bring the water once we were seated with a &#34;oh has anyone helped you yet?&#34;  We had to ask someone walking by for the bill as well at the end since no one was really checking up on us.

Really disappointed because I was hoping to like it with all the high ratings it had received."

Here is the scoop - a waiter who worked there for 8 years bought it from the original owners.  We went recently and the fish that we had was delicious, however half of our order never came after a good half hour.  I am giving this review five stars because Suzi (owner&#39;s sister) and manager was not only incredibly apologetic, she comped our entire meal including wine.  We actually argued that we would at least pay for the fish we did get, but she adamantly refused.

The place is cute overall and has a great outdoors patio. I also like that there is parking in the back that you can access right off of sunset, next to the entrance of the restaurant. 

Everyone appeared very friendly. However, overall service was not that great. Waiters don&#39;t appear to have too much knowledge of what&#39;s on the menu and what their chefs are capable of making for customers who have special orders. It took 25-35 minutes for our order to come out and it was a very small order and the restaurant was not packed. 

We were brought out the wrong dish initially and then the waiter took it to the right party who ordered it. 

The fish did seem fresh but nothing I tried was amazing. The menu is also pretty small - they need to be more creative with their rolls and provide more options. They also don&#39;t have signature hand rolls that other sushi places do.

I wouldn&#39;t go back. But it is new so the place has potential - just may need time."

The server came up to us after everyone at our table had finished except for me and my boyfriend who had never even received our food and asked how everything tasted. Like really dude you had one job and it was to bring us our food and ya didn&#39;t do that and instead of saying he was sorry and that there was a mix up the server made it seem like we were wrong and it took even longer to get our food. At this point we had been waiting a very long time and our friends who we were eating with had to leave so we asked for the check and neither of my rolls made it out! We said forget it and just take them off the bill. Very disappointed in the service b/c the sushi is pretty delicious and I would have loved to have eaten the food that I ordered. :/

Every detail was perfect from beginning to end. The location is a prime spot right there near bunker hill and is a popular choice for those either going to, or performing in shows that evening. The ambience of the restaurant is rather idyllic, comfortable, classy, warm and inviting without much pretense. In fact, the food lacks pretense as well. The star here is simply the great products offered. That is what you are paying for; the best possible ingredients treated with respect and offered in a simple way. This is very much in a similar vein to any top quality steakhouse, just your steak on the plate, order some sides to enjoy it with, focus on the best quality product and enjoy. Service was the best I have ever been offered. Our server knew the menu intimately  his recommendations were spot on every time, and he patiently helped ensure everyone ordered precisely what they would enjoy the most. Moreover, the bartender served up some of the best drinks any of us has had in awhile. That smoky old campfire old fashioned was to die for.

As for the food, we started with a round of appetizers. We always share so everyone can try everything. The clam chowder was absolutely delicious, as were the nantucket bay scallops. I myself ordered the crudo sampler and was enraptured by it. That was a wonderful plate of food. For entrees we tried the spiny lobster - incredible taste but it really shines in it&#39;s meaty texture compared to your typical maine lobster. We also had the miso black cod, which was served with some delectable bits of pork belly and the dover sole, cooked to absolute perfection. All of these were ideal plates, but mine was still my favorite. I was given an off the menu option to have the loup de mer done as a ceviche. It was astonishingly good, with some micro greens and thinly sliced fresno chilis for the perfect amount of heat. Honestly, from the amazing fresh, fluffy bread they served to the dessert round, the water grill has immediately become one of my favorite places in LA."

Zahava was one of the most amazing servers I have ever had. She was very professional and very knowledgeable. She suggested some oysters and they were perfectly paired with the other oysters we had ordered.

Service is never fully consistent, sometimes you&#39;re treated well (offered black or white napkinds) depending on your outfit. They I believe go through many employees as there has been a few times where I encounter mass interviews being conducted which takes away from the service you receive, since a bulk amount of onshift employees are assisting the hiring process (scattering resumes across a table near bar and entrance with visible notes on them &#34;no go&#34; etc.

Now for the food, the reason why I say it&#39;s &#34;ok&#34; is because the miso soup is extremely salty and the steak is never consistent, sometimes it taste editable, sometimes it taste like cardboard.

If you want to know what&#39;s good, then my choice would be the halibut, it&#39;s seasoned well, and comes with corn and spiced with fresh jalapenos. Another delicious meal is their &#34;mary&#39;s chicken&#34; though if you order this, expect long delays since it takes forever to cook -- so if you&#39;re set on this as your main course ask for it to be thrown on the grill as others in your party decide what they want to eat; you&#39;ll be doing yourself a solid as well as your parties."

APPETIZERS:
1. We got the deluxe ice shellfish platter. My favorite thing was probably just the scallops. Everything else was pretty mediocre. There was nothing special about the lobster, clams, mussels, or the jumbo shrimp. Maybe I&#39;m just not a fan of plain seafood.

2. The clam chowder was a bit too salty for my liking. All I tasted was the cream and the broth itself was lacking a bit. They did make it up by throwing in some real clams for display.

3. Complimentary bread was super fluffy! If I didn&#39;t have to save my stomach for the rest of the meal, I would definitely stuff my face with the bread. 

MAIN COURSE:
1.  The seabass was great! It melts in your mouth like butter, but it was way too oily. You can see the oils in the sauce and all over the plate.

2. The salmon was very mediocre. It kind of tasted like the ones you can get from Costco. It was also kind of dry. 

DESSERT:
1. I was a bigger fan of the caramel ice cream on top of the bread pudding, than the bread pudding itself.

2. Strawberry shortcake. The cake part was terrible. It was cold and hard like a rock. I literally just ate the strawberries."

It&#39;s one of the finer restaurants in LA and a great place to come for a romantic evening. I recently came on a Saturday night at 7 with my wife and the place was jumping!

To start, the greeting staff at the front was very nice and made sure we were seated promptly. Our server, Jenna, was also stellar during our time there. She had plenty of recommendations and made sure we didn&#39;t have to wait long for refills. 

The food was incredible! There was so much flavor packed into everything we had here! We decided to order Ecuadorian shrimp &amp; grits, jumbo lump blue crab cakes, shrimp fritters, Yukon mashed potatoes and scallops &amp; mussels. We were very satisfied with every item we chose. Luckily, we didn&#39;t have to wait much time for our food to come out.

There&#39;s valet parking available for $5. This is probably the best rate and beats trying to find a spot on the street.

The table seemed to like the bread but I found it not too exciting. However, I loved the shellfish platter! Ohmygoodness! We got the medium size to share for 6 and I couldn&#39;t get enough. My favorites were the jumbo shrimp, mussels, and oysters, but really everything was great. There was escargot which was popular with others. The only thing I was a little iffy about was the scallop with hazelnut. I didn&#39;t thought the texture of the two together was a little weird.

I shared the sea bass with the BF. We had asked what would be the recommendation and this was the answer. I&#39;m so glad I did. It was a good size (and price!) to share. Cooked perfectly and well-seasoned. The brown butter with the cauliflower puree was a nice touch. Nonetheless, I wasn&#39;t a big fan of either sides we ordered. The Mexican corn on the cob had a chewy texture to it and the mashed potatoes could have been more exciting.

Service was okay given that it was a pretty busy Monday night. I&#39;d come back for a special occasion."

The Shrimp Louie Salad is an excellent paleo option if you want to go lo carb.   it came with several butter lettuce leaves, jumbo shrimp, smoked bacon, half of an avocado, and their dressing on the side.   It was quite tasty. I just felt sorry for my dinner partner as he got stuck with that dry halibut.

He really took the time to understand my negative experience the first time, which was refreshing for a business that gets tons of customers on a daily basis. The experience was much better this time; however, the food still didn&#39;t amaze me unfortunately. If you do come here, the oysters are really good (one thing I definitely do recommend).

Water Grill offers a vast selection of the best and the finest seafood. My bf and I came here for a late lunch and we were super hungry so we ordered a ton of food. Here&#39;s what we ordered:

We started off with the New England style Clam Chowder ($10). It&#39;s probably one of the best clam chowders I&#39;ve had. It had a generous amount of clams, veggies, and potatoes inside. The soup itself was very consistent and it wasn&#39;t too thick or too runny, which is just how I like it. They start you off with some appetizer parmesan bread that tastes so good when you dip it in the clam chowder. 

We then ordered the Grand Seafood Tower ($45). This platter is perfect for two people and has a great assortment of fresh shellfish. It comes with 1/2 lobster, 6 wild Mexican jumbo shrimp, 6 blue mussels, 2 Peruvian bay scallops, 2 wild clams, and 3 different types of delicious oysters! Everything comes out super fresh on a bed of ice and lemons. It really is a masterpiece and it tastes even better than it looks. They give you six different types of sauces to dip your seafood in and they even provide you with tabasco if you need it! (We didn&#39;t)

Lastly, we also ordered the Chilean Sea Bass ($32) and it was cooked SO perfectly! I was never a fan of sea bass until that moment. It&#39;s served with cauliflower purée and hazelnuts on a lemony brown butter sauce. The sea bass was perfectly crisp and golden brown on the outside and it was so soft on the inside! The hazelnuts gave the dish a nutty, roasted flavor and it was truly a unique and unexpected but delicious combination. It&#39;s one of their signature dishes and there&#39;s good reason for it too! 

We also ordered their fresh lemonade because it was really hot outside and the lemonade went surprisingly well with the seafood! I never expected to drink lemonade at a seafood restaurant but their lemonade was super fresh and not too sweet at all. 

The ambience here is upscale, sophisticated, clean, and modern. The servers here are super attentive and friendly and make sure that you are enjoying your meal. There is a parking lot where you can valet and it&#39;s 5 bucks per two hours with validation or 8 bucks per three hours. I am totally coming back here when I&#39;m craving fresh and delicious seafood!!"

The food is pretty decent with a stupid scrumptious hot bread served while you wait. For starters we had the crab cake , beet salad, and a green salad, which were ok. I ordered the halibut and jalapeño corn and the date ate the lobster roll with fries. Both were pretty tasty and filling. Portion size was about average not too small and not huge. 

For desert,  we shared the warm salted caramel bread pudding served with vanilla ice cream. That was my favorite part of the meal. The drinks are equally as excellent.

I also took the recommendation of the server to order the sea bass, but have it prepared another way. I didn&#39;t realize this was going to cost more than the sea bass listed at $35.

I adore seafood, especially shellfish, so it only made sense to order the iced shellfish platter. We decided to go all out and order The Deluxe which is supposed to feed 3-4 people... We killed it. It was everything I wanted and more. The stacks of shellfish were gorgeous, way better than a bouquet of flowers. Bf knows the keys to my heart. 

We also ordered a clam chowder to share as an appetizer (which they split into two bowls without us asking, +1 brownie point). I wanted to save my belly for the shellfish so bf devoured all the bread. Seafood calls for white wine so we had a 1/2 carafe of Pinot Grigio, which is a great option that I wish more places had to offer. 

After the meal we were so stuffed that we fell into a food coma induced slumber and missed our Ja Rule and Ashanti concert. But it was worth it."

Clam chowder, so tasty.

Scallop with citrus- the scallop was so light and delicious. I tasted mango vinaigrette, minced vegetables and pistachio. I ordered half a dozen of this.

Shrimp cocktail- the shrimp was freshly peeled and deveined. It was not ordinary shrimp but had full on meat like prawns. I ordered half a dozen of this. 

Lobster roll and fries- 
I ordered this Connecticut style which is warm and the butter is mixed in already instead of the traditional lobster roll that is cold. The lobster was flavorful with the bun that was semi crispy to soft. This was perfect, a must order.

For starters my coworkers had the oysters appetizer. I didn&#39;t try any since I don&#39;t care for the texture but they loved them. I did enjoy how the waiter explained where each originated from. 

For an entree I had the lobster roll. The taste was delicious and fresh but I felt it could have used a bit more meat to even out the bread to meat ratio. The accompanied fries were good as well, big meaty steak fries with a crispy skin.

Lastly the dessert, OMG! We had the bread pudding and key lime cheese cake to share. So good!!

Service was good. My only complaint is that the booth I was sitting in wasn&#39;t that clean; there were a bunch of random stains everywhere."

The ambiance and decor is not what I imagined it to be (loud and casual for what is supposed to be an upscale establishment), but my expectations were pretty much met throughout the night. My only complaint is that the food does not quite match the astronomical prices that you have to pay. To be fair, the service is impeccable. The staff is formal, yet friendly. They will take your coat, validate parking (for a discount), and provide seemingly knowledgeable recommendations, so kudos to them for providing us with wonderful service. That&#39;s probably the biggest takeaway from this place.

Now onto the meal... For the appetizer, we ordered the Dungeness crab with the Louis sauce. The way it was prepared was decent, but I&#39;m not a fan of chilled crab. They took the crab out of the shell and paired it with some sauce and veggies. We also had the Wild Tahitian Bigeye Tuna that was lightly seared and mostly raw with red beet jam, horseradish cream, and mizuna on the side. I definitely preferred this dish a lot better because it was flavorful and tasted better than I thought it would.

For dessert, we shared a chocolate and peanut butter cake that came with marshmallow and popcorn. it was topped with banana ice cream. We also shared a Red Velvet chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream and fresh raspberries.

Would I come back here again? If the opportunity ever presents itself, I would be open to it."

I&#39;ve been back for a lunch at the raw bar, and a dinner with old friends. In both cases, there was much to be in love with. They&#39;re redone the place since I had been in long ago. It&#39;s now less stuffy, but with a brisk scent of power-meals all around. At these prices, one might expect the freshest of the fresh, extraordinary culinary work and first class service. It was pretty seamless here, with one minor issue that got resolved.

Waiting at the bar, my friends and I got our small tab before sitting down to our table. In fairness, it looked like there was a bit of bartender flip-flopping was going on. We got the wrong bill, got charged for it anyway, and it took a bit of faith and a day or two to be sure the correct bar tab was used. 

That aside, I had a peerless example of being at the bar for a lunch, over the summer. A lady shucked my three oysters (Shiguko) and easily shared the histories of both the restaurant as well as the origins of said oysters. They were really delicious, and the bread that accompanies it is too good not to try. My seasonal entree was the Halibut Succotash, which I loved. Seared and sitting atop a mini garden of vegetables, the fish was presented perfectly cooked, and perfectly good. Moist, flavorful and hearty.

For dinner, a couple months later, we shared a few glasses of a Duckworth red, so, some of my details may be sketchy. Still, the Mahi Mahi was very good - again with a great flavor, plenty moist and a sturdy fish. Less successful was the Caesar salad which, for some reason, tasted ordinary and too casual for my tastebuds. Not much of a curtain-raiser, alas.

We split a dessert, which was outstanding. I think it may have been bread-pudding, ala mode. Regardless, it was an absolute winner with what tasted to be an earned-sweetness that wasn&#39;t overly done or full of gimmicks. The vanilla ice-cream was what dairy dreams are made of.

Lovely place to kick back with friends, or have a special date, or even sit alone and contemplate just how tasty this world truly is."

Able to get reservations same day, this place isn&#39;t ever really overcrowded. Valet is right out front, it&#39;s downtown so only choice you really have.

Drinks I&#39;ve tried:

Grand Ave (5 stars)- Yummy vodka drink with strawberries! mmm!

Margarita Verde (5 stars)- Yummy margarita, with a special rim and a little bit of spice!

Also got some white wine here since they have a lot of light fish that goes well with it, they always recommend some really good stuff!

Appetizers:

Oysters (5 stars)- Always get the oysters here, they have a HUGE selection, always splitting the order, but we also always make sure to include my fav Kumamoto.

Atlantic Cod Fish Tacos (5 stars)- I love fish tacos, and were craving some, these were actually so GOOD! Def satisfied my cravings!

Jumbo lump blue crab cake (5 stars)- This is really good and super fresh, the celery root remoulade makes this dish super solid.

Clam Chowder (5 stars)- Some really good clam chowder! 

Entrees:

Chilean Sea Bass (3.5 stars)- I&#39;ve had this twice, once where they do a butternut squash twist and the other with a ricotta gnudi and brown butter type gnocchi. Anyways the fish doesn&#39;t really come sauced, just cooked with some herbs it looks like. I love sauce so that would be a wow factor for me, just needs more flavor. Right now it&#39;s only the things on the side I described that are really the only thing that compliments it.

Salmon (3.5 stars)- I love salmon and wanted to try it here when I came, it was cooked well, but I just need different things to compliment this dish &amp; sauce arghhh. I&#39;ve had better, but oh well at least I tried it. Next time I&#39;m getting the fish &amp; chips ;)

Ecuadorian Shrimp &amp; Grits (5 stars)- My brother tried this out and ooooh so good. This dish had so much flavor I was surprised!

Black Cod Miso (5 stars)- This fish is always cooked really well, I mean it&#39;s miso cod, so good. I have to try this again but the one I had at Nobu Malibu is amazing.

Wild Alaskan Red King Crab Legs (4 stars)- This dish is really big, the crab is always very fresh, my brother always enjoys this!

Sides:

Mashed Potatoes (5 stars)- These mashed potatoes are so creamy and so amazing! One of my favs!

Desserts:

Caramel Bread Pudding (5 stars)- This is sooooo delicious, one of the really good bread puddings I&#39;ve had! I love that this also has that sea salt flavor, huge portion too, which I love hehe.

Orange Blossom Cake (1 star)- DO NOT GET THIS! Arghhh. If you don&#39;t like rose water even a little, don&#39;t get this, you won&#39;t like it, it&#39;s overpowering! I was the only one at the table wanting dessert so I didn&#39;t want to get the bread pudding to myself because it&#39;s too heavy, they were out of something else I wanted (I hate when that happens), so I decided to go with this out of hesitation. Plus the waitress said if I didn&#39;t like it to just let her know. Since I really wanted dessert but also hesitant about this one, I know, real problems haha. Anyways, go with something else, horrible rose water taste!

The service is always great here, we frequent this place often because my spoiled little brother likes it so much haha, but I&#39;m not complaining. Hehe."

What an epic way to bring me down from my week-date night.

Parking
Plenty of street parking available, but if you don&#39;t want the hassle (however minimal), valet parking is only $8.

Staff
Very friendly and attentive.  We had reservations for 7:30, arrived 20 minutes early and were seated right away.  They were very nice to switch our table to booth seating when I asked.

Appetizers
**Bread - what can I say?  They came in warm.  And fluffy.  Yay.

**Kumamoto Oysters - ordered a dozen and it one of the only two bright spots of our dining experience.  I like the mild sweet taste; don&#39;t ruin it with any lemon or whatever sauce you may be tempted to put on there.  However, be ready to spit out shell pieces.   Someone still needs more practice in the kitchen.

**Jumbo Lump Blue Crab Cake - it was ok.  I was happier with the Celery Root Remoulade than the crab cake but the pairing definitely worked.

**Fritto Misto - I understand people don&#39;t want to drown seafood with batter but for the love of God, please make sure there&#39;s flavor in what little batter you want to use.  What&#39;s that?  I&#39;m supposed to use the dipping sauce?  That&#39;s an option, that&#39;s why they&#39;re served on the side. And it&#39;s just wrong if I need to slather the food with dip just to get any flavor. 

Side
**Mac N Cheese -  I didn&#39;t order this but of course I had to try.  Too salty.  He took a bite, I took two and we left it alone for the rest of the evening.

Entrée
**Chilean Sea Bass - He liked it.  Very moist, with a hint of coconut milk maybe?  Served with gnocchi.  It was aight.

Drinks
**Ichinokura &#39;Himezen Sweet,&#39; Junmai  - worth the $55/bottle price, if you&#39;re into sweet sake.  The only other thing I liked from the place.

**Sunset Mimosa - pretty heavy on the &#34;bitters&#34; there, Sir.

FINAL VERDICT:
Go to EMC in Korea Town.  Same price range, better food selection."

We waited about 15 minutes then were seated by the window looking onto the main street. It is definitely a nice place with a cozy atmosphere. The oyster bar is beautiful as well! I did not like the fact that we had to wait 15 min even after having reservations... there was a nice gentleman that asked us if we wanted drinks serviced to us while we were waiting up in the front host stand. We refused as we did not plan on having drinks tonight.. we were just hungry! :)

The food is decent and I&#39;ve had better but I did like how they have the iced shellfish platter! We ordered the &#34;Deluxe&#34; and it was enough for the 5 of us to share.. a good amount of the different oysters and lots of jumbo shrimp, mussels, some lobster, king crab nuggets, scallops, clams and escargot. This platter was $85.. kind of overpriced."

From the cocktails to an incredible desert the evening was perfect. We enjoyed their caramalizef onion and asiago cheese bread followed by the most delicious crab cake I have ever eaten. It had a touch of heat in the aioli that was to die for. Our entrees consisted of King Salmon and Swordfish. Cooked to perfection and fresh as could be. The maple cheesecake was a perfect finish for the meal! The service was incredible and went so far as to order us a cab to take us to the Ahmenson. We are very lucky to have a new Water Grill in Orange County where we live that we will be visiting soon!

A very lively place in the financial district of downtown LA.  They boast some good seafood but let&#39;s see how that hype lives up.

I was recommended to try their iced seafood platter and was not disappointed.  They have very fresh chilled seafood on display.  My friend and I got The Grand platter for two and it was pretty filling.  It was an assortment of mussels, clams, lobster, scallops, shrimps, and oysters.  Everything tasted fresh without the sour taste you get when seafood is frozen.

We also got some entrees.  I got the Cioppino and my friend got the Halibut.  He said the Halibut was dry.  My Cioppino was good.  Not the best but still tasty.  The fish in my Cioppino was dry too but the sauce made up for it.

What makes this a 4 star and not 3 star in my book is the service.  Awesome service here.  From the moment you step in, to the interactions with the bartender, to the friendly wait staff.

Next time I&#39;d probably just do a larger seafood platter and maybe one appetizer for a dinner for two.  Great atmosphere and a restaurant worth revisiting."

I ordered the clam chowder ($12), which was very good. I had the lobster roll, Connecticut style, which came with fries. The fries were very good. The lobster was okay. I ended up biting down on a large piece of shell, which was disappointing - I would expect much more care in preparations with a $28 price tag. After I finished, another patron sat next to me at the bar and was promptly delivered complimentary warm bread and butter. At no point was I offered this and began to look around at all other tables in the restaurant and noticed they all had complimentary bread and butter. Maybe it was overlooked, but again, at this price point, the service should be on point. Food was an overall 3 1/2, but the issues with some service bring it to a 2."

Stopped here for early evening (5:30pm reservation) weekday date night because we were lured in by the no corkage fee. Started getting busier in the restaurant around 6:30pm, but was very quite before then. Amazing oysters, the scallops were wonderful and the chocolate souffle was delicious!

After the slight issues with Takami, I decided to change my reservation to the Watergrill and I&#39;m so happy I did! Located next to the historic Biltmore Hotel, parking is always in lots, streets and structure. However, be prepared to pay a pretty penny for structure. 

As usual, leaving from SGV, it was about a 30 minute drive, not looking for parking or the valet. Once parked, my friends arrived several minutes before me. They had no issues getting seated before my arrival which I&#39;m happy about. 

As tonight is my first time, I let my friends suggest and choose what to order. We opted for the Deluxe Platter, and my entree I split the Wild Pacific Swordfish with my friend as I told him I had never tried it. We ordered the Clam Chowder as a starter to try amongst everyone. 

Loved everything!! Honestly, not one thing was bad. The Deluxe Platter was amazing, and the swordfish was delicious. The Clam Chowder is not as creamy say like Boudin, nonetheless still yummy. 

As I was celebrating my birthday, Watergrill gave me a lovely Pizookie which I will say maybe better than BJ&#39;s! An amazing time!! Great to celebrate a milestone! 

Tips- While they say there is Valet, I couldn&#39;t find them so I pulled into the first structure I saw. It&#39;s normal maximum is $30, I said it was my birthday and he knocked it down to $20. Oh well, at least he parked it for me. Hate dealing with parking in DTLA."

We shared the Grand Raw Shellfish platter with Oysters, Mussels, Lobster, Shrimp, Prawns and Periwinkles! Love how they bring out 7 different sauces. 

For my entree I had the sea bass and he the salmon. It was yummy! Sides were Mac N Cheese, Broccolini and Elote! Everything was excellent.

I always order some oysters.  Light and refreshing!  I try to get the fish of the day or the special.  I like to see what the chefs like to cook up.  I&#39;m not picky about random and extreme flavors so I eat everything.  I am very open minded.  I try not to change stuff.  The chef makes a dish a certain way for a reason.  The moment you take away ingredients, it is no more the chefs dish :-)

We decided to walk around town and fell upon Water Grill. We knew exactly what we wanted.. the Seafood TOWER! That is really what we ordered because we ordered the big one for about 3-4 people. I was stuffed The seafood was very fresh! The shrimp was amazing. The different oysters provided a nice variety of flavors. The lobster was my favorite! I didn&#39;t need anything with it. The meat was so fresh and tender! The ambiance was low lit and chill. I enjoyed the place very much and a must if you are going to be in downtown."

The food is always excellent, the service is great and the atmosphere is relaxing and classy. 

I&#39;ve had several of Watergrill&#39;s entrees, from steak to seafood and the one that keeps me coming back is the Halibut. This is THE best halibut that I&#39;ve ever had the pleasure of eating, they place it on top of a bed of jalapeno whole-kernel corn which adds a little kick to the meal, but not enough kick to overpower the dish.

The only problem I have with watergrill is the lack of consistency with their entrees. while I have never had an overall bad experience at this establishment, the entrees often differ from day-to-day or depending on lunch/dinner. Which is the primary reason I have to take one start away from them, if they could get some consistency in place with their main entrees then it would be a perfect dining experience.

Overall, it&#39;s an excellent place to come for lunch or dinner."

The seafood tower was okay. It had mussels, clams, lobster, scallops, shrimps, and oysters, and it came with 6 different sauces. As for the iced shellfish platter, it wasn&#39;t anything special. The shrimp was disappointing as well. I personally recommend their chilean sea bass and ceviche.  Some reviews complained that the chilean sea bass was lacking flavor, but I think it&#39;s perfect and just-right. Since the sea bass wasn&#39;t heavily seasoned, you can taste the original sweetness of the fish. Overall, I love the dining experience. The environment was classy, and service was excellent."

I met my mom and pops and we all agreed the venue was very nice. The restaurant is very comfortable. I do not think I would like a table as there are a lot of them in the center of the floor so fortunately we were able to get one of the big comfy booths on the side. The tables arent bad, I just really like booths...

I went with the Halibut and was not disappointed, It was rich and cooked to perfection. It was flakey and very buttery. I also ordered the mac n cheese was was AWESOME! I love spiral noodles so when I saw them bring them out I was already happy before I even tasted it! My fiancee got the filet mignon and hold up, it was MEGA delicious!!!! I was suprised how good this actually was. Me and my fiancee eat a lot of steaks, but this one was special! I can say enough about it! She orederd the mashed potatoes and that was really the only part of our meal that fell a little short. Mom and pops both loved their plates as well but we all agreed, the potatoes were, meh.

DRINKS
Gin Gin Mule (4 stars): Good, but I love Moscow Mules more! 

FOOD
Complimentary Sea Salt Bread: Delicious.

Oysters (5 stars): Yum! Kumamoto was one of my favs! Very fresh.

Wild Alaskan Red King Crab Legs (4 stars): Huge legs! So you get a good amount of meat. Just wasn&#39;t as flavorful as I&#39;d like.

Wild Morro Bay Black Cod &#34;MISO&#34; (5 stars): SO flavorful. Melts in your mouth, cooked so well. I&#39;d definitely recommend this.

Clam Chowder (4 stars): Smooth and creamy.

Wild Rose Chilean Sea Bass (3 stars): Not cooked as well as the cod. It was okay. I&#39;ve had better. My uncle orders Chilean Sea Bass at every restaurant that offers it and he wasn&#39;t that impressed either. 

Caramel Bread Pudding (5 stars): Rich, salty, and caramely! Love the ice cream with it! It needs a little more ice cream to keep the ratios of bread pudding to ice cream right...I love having perfect ratios for perfect bites (= but this dessert will definitely hit the spot! Especially if you love the salty sweet desserts! Share because it is heavy..but you will be tempted to just eat it all yourself..I tried.

ATMOSPHERE (5 stars)
Gorgeous inside and the building you walk through to get here...even more gorgeous! 

SERVICE (5 stars)

I have been here a few times and haven&#39;t been disappointed yet. It is in the &#34;upscale&#34; list of restaurants and the prices will scream upscale for sure too. 

The food here is usually very exquisite and well prepared and so is the presentation. Obviously they lean on seafood dishes but their meats aren&#39;t bad either. 

The interior of the restaurant is a very low lit tables and smaller tables set up. Not sure how to describe the décor, but lets say its definitely not modern. A bar sits at the center of the restaurant.

I would either way recommend this place. If at least to visit once and say you have tried it. I will also at some point be back to this place.

The biggest challenge is parking, although they have a validated parking location next door that isn&#39;t easy to get to or park your car in."

Expect to probably pay a bit over 50 bucks each and get a solid, but not spectacular meal. I am not a raw fish fan so I cannot comment on the raw seafood and oysters, but the clam chowder was a decent starter (although I have certainly had better in Seattle, the bay area and boston/maine). The table bread was also incredible and had a nice salt on it - they were nice enough to let me bring some extra home! Really a highlight for me - I would be happy just with bread and clam chowder and dessert I think.

As for the main courses, all three that I have tried were fine but nothing crazy. The chilean sea bass was decent (although the squash gnocchi it came with truly did steal the show), the orecchiette with shrimp was fine, and the whole bass loup de mer was pretty good, although I think I might prefer these fish grilled rather than their oven roasted with a white win saffron sauce. So I&#39;d recommend that given the options. None of the dishes really stood out to me, they were all just good - the kale on the side was a little bizarre too. Not a huge fan of that one. I do want to try the cioppino at some point though!

As for the desserts, the souffle was very good (but not as good as say, bottega louie&#39;s - but you can actually hear your friends talk here so thats a plus), caramel bread pudding with caramel ice cream was delicious, and the maple cheesecake was decent.

Service was kinda average, I felt like they were pushing mostly just the higher priced stuff, and our waiter awkwardly flipped my menu (which I was looking at) to show my father-in-law something on another page. Weird. BUT they were pretty attentive and prompt (not to mention very knowledgeable about the menu and seafood in general), and lots of people came by to check on us. The decor of the restaurant is nice - very classy and upscale."

The place is nice inside with a slightly dimmed light.  The service was excellent and the food was good for the most part.  We had ceviche as an appetizer which was offered off the menu by our server and a deep fried seafood platter.  Then we had Chilean Sea Bass and a Scallop entree we also order a side of fries.

-Chilean Sea Bass was excellent very tasty and juice.
-Scallop Entree was ok but i will not be ordering again.
-The Ceviche came in shape of a fish which was unique 
but the sauce was missing something.  i would not order it again. (BTW cost was 36 dollars for an appetizer??)

Overall, I would not come back to the restaurant.  I am Chinese American and I am spoiled with cheap (but good and tasty) and decently price Chinese food in our Chinese communities.  The bill came a little under 150 and left 15% tip (came to be 160s with no drinks order).  I was hoping my bill to be after tax and tip around 120 but the Ceviche jacked up the price another 40+ dollars. 

On the good side, the side fries were really good and they give you warm bread after they take your drinks for free.  So i may change my mind and come here for snack instead."

However - we were the only table without the &#39;nice, cushy&#39; chairs. Instead we had chairs that were (literally) pulled from the bar.. So it made us feel a little like outcasts. 

Our reservation had been set 3 weeks prior but they almost seemed like they weren&#39;t ready for us (with last minute chair-pulls from the bar to fill our table, and offering a larger table after we had already been seated). 

Upon ordering, I asked our server for his opinion on the lobster roll and he described it at succulent and flavorful. The lobster itself was good, but there were no other flavors to speak of.

The portions are quite small. And I get it.. It&#39;s a fancy LA seafood spot, but had it not been for the complimentary bread, we probably would&#39;ve gone out for a snack afterwards.

We were celebrating a birthday and they brought out dessert for the birthday boy, but no song. Wouldn&#39;t have been a big deal had they not JUST finished singing to the table next to us. So that was kinda weird."

A couple feet below ground level, guests enter down into the restaurant thought a small set of stairs. The ambience is fantastic if you are looking for an energetic but romantic dinner, it&#39;s unlike the average romantic spots around the area. 

To start off, I had a reservation for 2 at 7:45pm on Valentine&#39;s Day, but wasn&#39;t seated till 8:30. This was understandable since it was such a busy holiday and I didn&#39;t mind waiting since I just walked over to the bar to grab a drink. It took about 15 minutes for someone to grab my order. One of the bartenders ended up showing another customer some serious attitude... Which he and the manager later apologized for and offered that couple complementary champagne... Yikes. 

Once we were seated we ordered the Grand Platter, Chilean Sea Bass, and Octopus pasta (custom order). The Grand Platter was DELISH, all the seafood was so fresh. But the entrees we ordered were average... I personally didn&#39;t think they were worth the money as much as the Grand Platter was.  I wanted a pasta dish, so our server was kind enough to request the kitchen to whip up a special octopus pasta for me that was not on the menu. 

Overall, eating at the Water Grill was a beautiful experience. Worth a Try!"

I was recovering from some nasty food poisoning so I steered clear of any raw or seafood items.  Basically I ate like a 5 year old and ordered pasta and fries.

Our party of three waited only a few minutes, and we were seated at the tables by the bar. It was a Thursday night and the place was packed. The music inside almost rivals that of Bestia, but not quite as loud. Still, it was hard to hear the person sitting right across from me. I was excited to try this place; we came for the oysters, and ordered several other items as well.

The decor features plenty of gray, neutral and blue colors. Circular lights hanging from the ceiling resemble the steering wheel at the helm of a ship. There are lots of wine bottle displays.

We got right down to business and ordered oysters. The Thorndyke Bay oysters were described as being big, so we feared they would taste metallic. I prefer sweet oysters, and I&#39;m okay with varying levels of brininess.

There were three of us, so instead of ordering the dozen sampler, we got 18 oysters--3 each of 6 different kinds so each of us could try all of them. We also got an extra dozen Kumamotos.

Oysters:
- Stingray, Chesapeake Bay, Maryland
- Pacific Kiss, British Columbia, Canada
- Thorndyke Bay, Hood Canal, Washington
- Marin Miyagi, Puget Sound, Washington
- Shakespeare Creek, British Columbia, Canada
- Kumamoto, Humboldt Bay, California

The same oyster can taste different depending on the season. Environmental factors, such as climate and spawning, contribute to the varying tastes. The same oyster could taste salty in the fall, but buttery in the spring.

The oysters came with mignonette, lemon, horseradish, and cocktail sauce.

I usually like to try my oysters naked--without adding anything to them. Then, if necessary I can add lemon to cut the brininess, or cocktail sauce to add flavor. I don&#39;t really care for horseradish or mignonettes, but I&#39;ll dabble in them once in a while.

Most of the oysters contained a mild salt level. The textures varied between soft and slightly chewy. Only the Marin Miyagi was overly briny. They were all good, with my favorite being the Thorndyke Bay--it wasn&#39;t metallic like I feared a large oyster would be--instead it was sweet with a light, almost cucumber finish. I would order a dozen Thorndykes next time.

My least favorite were the stingray and pacific kiss. They were both standard, with the pacific kiss being more briny than the stingray.

The Marin Miyagi, Shakespeare Creek, and Kumamoto were all good. The Kumamotos were actually brinier than expected, but still sweet. 

I must have gotten lucky, because all of the oysters I ate were good and without any broken shells. My two buddies both said they got multiple broken shells throughout their oysters. Whoever shucked them needs to exercise more care in the future.

Next came the ahi tuna burger, which my buddy and I split. I was really looking forward to this burger, but it was just okay. The ahi patty was a little bit dry, and there wasn&#39;t much tuna flavor. Strangely, the fries and onion rings that came with the ahi tuna burger were stellar. This is a seafood place, but the fries and onion rings were the best part of the dish. The fries were perfectly fried, crispy, and flavorful. The onion rings were crispy and succulent.

The clam chowder was a thin, almost watery consistency, which took me by surprise. It actually almost worked, but didn&#39;t quite make the cut. The flavor was interesting; it was like wood, almost oaky. Perhaps it was smoky. The flavors tried to work together, but overall I&#39;d prefer a traditional, creamy clam chowder.

The crab cake was light, tangy, not fried too much. It used real crab and wasn&#39;t overly battered. I could actually taste the crab and it was fresh with a little kick. It was moist and meaty.

The uni toast featured small pieces uni atop crispy bread. Daikon, green onion, and fish eggs were three different toppings on each piece. I had the piece with daikon, and it was nothing special. Putting uni on top of bread is a waste, IMO.

If you&#39;re a high roller, you can get a whole sea urchin for $150.

My tastebuds returned from the ride with mixed emotions. The main attraction (oysters) were pretty good. The other items were hit or miss. The crab cake was sensational. Overall I&#39;m a fan and would come back for more oysters. The price is reasonable and comparable to the going rate for oysters that are not part of a happy hour special (roughly $3 per oyster). I&#39;ll be back for another oyster feeding frenzy!"

As a Boston native, there IS no clam chowda&#39; anywhere outside New England. None. Never. No how!

And then you walk into Water Grill, and your world, like a scene out of &#39;The Matrix&#39; shatters into digital nothingness. Simply amazing clam chowder. Yes, something to write home about. I hate that I love it.

One of the great standouts of Water Grill (and I&#39;ve eaten downtown and Santa Monica) is the impeccable service. This is one of those restaurants that goes beyond normal. You almost feel uncomfortable that the service is that good. I consider this professional on international standards, which, believe it or not, is actually rare in Los Angeles. This goes WAAAY past the superficial niceness you&#39;ll find elsewhere. Water Grill is professional.

You like Mussels? You&#39;ll never be able to eat them elsewhere after you&#39;ve had them here. Not kosher at all with the bacon, but for those of you that love bacon, this place raises the bar. It&#39;s like the most amazing bacon chocolate bar...... but mussels (ok.... I&#39;m stretching it, but think OUT of the box).

John Dory, one of my favorite fishes, is fantastic, and I feel sorry for the person trying to decide between this and their signature salmon dish. It&#39;s a Betty vs Veronica debate (I just totally dated myself with that reference). You can&#39;t lose with either choice.

Dessert? ugh........ I was supposed to be on a chubby-cheek-reduction diet. No thanks to Water Grill, my pictures still look like the Michelin man. Again, something I hate to love.

So yeah...... if you hate to love food, this is your new home."

My husband and I put in for a table reservation just a few hours before on a Friday night (bad idea) and the first available table was at 8:45 pm. We weren&#39;t in a rush so decided to jump on it. We arrived at 8:15 pm and were told the other 8:45pm reservation arrived before us so we would have a little more time to wait (huh?). 

We said we&#39;d grab a drink at the bar, which was open seating and had the full menu there. The bartender was super friendly, made a great cocktail, and had more than excellent recommendations when it came to our food/drink selections, so we decided to just order at the bar area. We like the more cause vibe of the bar versus a table, sometimes. 

I must say, our bartender never led us wrong. She recommended the clam chowder over the miso, which I&#39;m glad she did because my husband and I can hands down say that was the best clam chowder we have ever tasted. Which says a lot because my husband will order clam chowder any time he sees it on a menu. Any. Time. And of course I&#39;ll always have a bite of it. But this was exceptional, real clams, broth wasn&#39;t overly creamy or thick. Just experience for yourself, I beg of you.

Then we ordered the grilled octopus (our favorite dish in Portugal) and can&#39;t say I was too impressed. Maybe because there was too much of an Italian influence on the dish with marinara - I just didn&#39;t dig it. 

Next we shared two crudo plates: hamachi and tuna. Unbelievable. So good. The tuna had a crème fraîche and a red beet sauce that I can&#39;t describe well at all. I thought it was fine, didn&#39;t add much to the fish for me, but maybe I&#34;m just not that sophisticated. The hamachi on the other hand was right up my alley with a jalapeño cream that was to die for. 

We also got the beet salad, which my husband loved. Normally I&#39;m more on the salad appreciation team, but I wasn&#39;t that into it. My husband, on the other hand, devoured the entire thing. The salad was very lightly dressed, which I thought was well done.

I couldn&#39;t resist dessert and ordered the caramel bread pudding. As usual, the bartender was spot on in telling us to pair some whiskey with the dessert - match made in heaven. My husband says he&#39;s never been in to bread pudding, but ended up eating more than his fair share and loving it.  

Overall, we left there happy and I only left with one regret: not getting actual shellfish, I love a good oyster bar. I just got too caught up in the clam chowder and delicious cocktails. 

Service was 5 star once we sat. Bill was up there for what I listed above + my husband got 2 beers and a whisky with dessert + a couple cocktails myself = $180ish. BUT, if you want your money well spent on good food, service, and ambience, this is the right place to do it."

Oyster Sampler - we got a 1/2 dozen, 3 Eastern and 3 Pacific and they were all super fresh.. some of the best oysters I&#39;ve had in a very long time. Obviously on the pricey side but worth it!

Chilean Sea Bass - it was tender and juicy as everyone&#39;s stated.. but I thought it was still lacking a lot flavor. I had to add salt and pepper to my dish. The little gnocchi&#39;s they had on the side were good though but very strong in taste.

Orange Blossom Cake - this was surprisingly good! The cake is more like a corn bread texture, but the rose water definitely brought this dessert to another level. It&#39;s not for everyone, but if you&#39;re looking to try something different, this is it!

Honestly, not sure if I&#39;d come back any time soon."

We started off at the bar with their Gin Gin Mule, which was mainly crushed ice, and a tiny bit of gin, ginger beer, and mint. I normally opt for a great glass of wine, and I regret not doing so. :( Needless to say, we eventually ordered one of our favorite chardonnays - Mer Soleil (unoaked happiness in a bottle!).

The oyster sampler is the way to go if you haven&#39;t dined at Water Grill before and want a tasting of everything. However, we ended up getting half dozen of the Blue Pool and another half of the Rincon oysters. The Blue Pool were on the sweeter side while the Rincon were, though still sweet, a little more briney. Both were excellent!

Definitely order the uni if you&#39;re a fan. They crack open the shell, spoon the uni onto a plate, and serve it with the shell on the side. The first time I came here, I talked the guy preparing ours into cleaning the shell out and putting the uni back into it, and he did! This time, however, I refrained from asking because it was a rather busy night for them due to a nearby conference.

The Wild Spanish Octopus was probably the most tender octopus I&#39;ve ever had. Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t care too much for the flavor profile as it was lacking a little more spice in my opinion., and for $16, I expected to get a little more than three half-inch pieces. Regardless, it&#39;s still a good appetizer to get.

I&#39;ve had their Chilean seabass with gnudi and was so in love with it! I like a good, fatty, white fish. This time, I had the Alaskan Black Cod with miso and pork belly. It wasn&#39;t as amazing as the description sounded. The pork belly was lackluster in flavor, but the fish ended up pairing very well with the above mentioned Charddonay.

I&#39;m a sucker for some funky, delicious cheese. So, of course, I had to order the cheese plate. I absolutely love bleu cheeses (it&#39;s certainly not for everyone), so it&#39;s really no surprise that I found the Spanish sheep bleu to be so phenomenal. This plate also included Humboldt Fog, a popular California goat cheese. The aged Gouda paired so nicely with the walnuts, but I&#39;m also a huge fan of Gouda in general. Finally, there was also a French cow cheese (from the Epoisses Village) that&#39;s funky and stinky but has a surprisingly mild taste to it.

Overall, Water Grill is a must try if you&#39;re a seafood lover, but don&#39;t expect to walk away with your wallet still in your pocket. The bill starts to add up quickly, and I feel like the portions have gotten smaller since my first visit about two years ago."

We ordered the &#34;Blue Point&#34; and &#34;Naked Cowboy&#34; half dozen oysters. The oysters were so fresh and the presentation was amazing. 

My girlfriend is a huge fan of seafood and for her to love the food was a GREEAT accomplishment and compliment. Lol

We finished our meal with the caramel bread pudding and a few quick drinks. The valet parking is validated and the service was super quick.

It was everyones first time to the uncontested legendary seafood restaurant in Downtown LA. We were the first party there at 11:30am. It looked empty at first, but then very quickly got packed. 

We started with the New England Clam Chowder and Oyster Sampler. I personally like my clam chowder very creamy, and this dish was the exact opposite. I&#39;ve had a lot of oyster all over California and Mexico. And I never knew that they could have such magnificent different flavors. We only ordered a half dozen, and now I wish we would have order 2 dozen! Paired with a sunset mimosa, I was having a good time. 

For my entree I ordered the Wild Ross Sea Chilean Seabass. It did not disappoint. Imagine chewing on a fluffy cloud packed with bold flavor, it was like eating the most delicious air with a side of scallops. 

This place ended up being a lot cooler than I thought it would be."

We shared the oyster sampler platter and each one we tried was very tasty. Girlfriend got the clam chowder which was great and I had the salmon which was not bad either. I&#39;m not a huge salmon fan so I wasn&#39;t all over it but it was still a quality dish. For a drink I had the Grand Avenue cocktail and it was super delicious. Loved it and I wanted a second but at $13 a drink I had to stop at one. 

I will be back for sure but only on special occasions as this place can get a bit pricey."

Last minute dinner plans on a Thursday, we decided to try Water Grill. Luckily, there were spaces for us to sit by the bar area. Ambience is casual but classy.  Towards the back they have a glass wine cellar. 

::Drinks::
I was told the Grand Avenue is a very popular cocktail for the ladies so I tried it.  Would I get it again? Yeah.  It has vodka, strawberry, lemon juice, and tarragon. Dark and Stormy needed more alcohol.  This cocktail has dark rum, lime juice, and ginger beer. 

::Food::
The complimentary bread was warm and topped with sea salt.
~First Course~
I liked the New England Clam Chowder.  It has manila clams and applewood smoked bacon. The Wild Maldives Island Bigeye Tuna Crudo was bland to me.  It was topped with fennel pollen and small diced oranges; also had fennel orange puree.

~Second Course~
The portions were more than enough, I didn&#39;t finish it.  I enjoyed each dish we got, it was cooked and seasoned well! The Wild Costa Rican Mahi Mahi has celery root and sherry puree. It also came with baby beets and carrots. Farmed Loch Duart Atlantic Salmon has caramelized endive and crisp pancetta.
The Farmed Texas Silver Streak Striped Bass laid on parmesan cream.  The farro risotto was a little too al dente. 

::Dessert::
~Final Course~
We got the Caramel Bread Pudding.   It was served warm with a scoop of ice cream and sprinkled with alaea red sea salt.  

::Customer Service::
It was a little slow.  Brian was friendly and very helpful.

&#39;Twas an evening where a party of twelve was celebrating two birthdays, the host and our server, Scott, left us satisfied.

Now, we&#39;re the type of ppl that are chill and laid back so whenever we go to restaurant, whether BJ&#39;s or Mastro&#39;s, I don&#39;t think I can ever get used to servers calling my husband &#34;sir.&#34; 

Some of us started with oysters, which were fricken phenomenal, tuna poké, and complimentary bread. 

I ordered salmon as my entrée and it was cooked perfectly! The skin was crisp, just how I like it. The bed of beans were ok. I did enjoy the delicate sauce of coconut lime they were in.

Kid got their lobster roll and they did not skimp on the lobsta. She got the traditional style and it was bomb! Bread was a perfect match! In fact, she brought half home and I finished it as a midnight &#34;snack,&#34; lol. 

Hubby enjoyed their rib eye cooked medium rare to his liking, still mooin&#39; n shit. I had a piece and it was pretty darn good, but it was enough for me.

Scott was exceptional and was around whenever we needed him."

Water Grill was a true fine dining establishment that was dark, opulent, elegant with a fine service of waiters who glided through the restaurant with dignified demeanor.  The tables were set with fine linen &amp; heavy cutlery, and the place reeked of a wonderful tranquility not so known now that such screechy eateries such as Bottega Louis, Bestia, Animal and their ilk predominate where people scream at each other just to be heard.  We have turned into a society that seems to abhor silence.

Starting with the Great Recession of 2008, many restaurants went under, and it seems that Water Grill was aware that if it didn&#39;t change to a more mass appealing dining venue, it too would experience the same fate.  Now there are fishing reels &amp; poles lining the walls, white table cloths have disappeared along with the heavy cutlery.  Now there are plastic laminate tables.  The water glasses are plebian.  The elegant Water Grill is no more, but a more popularized variant is now in its place with a good attending crowd.  Times &amp; tastes change....so be it.

I shared this DineLA meal with the ever charming &amp; delightful Elite Yelper, Isobel L., where we sampled each other&#39;s dishes to  double the experience.  

1)  New England Clam Chowder had Manila Clams in its shell, bits of carrots &amp; potato, touch of applewood smoked bacon.  The ingredients were good, but it seemed to lack a good seafood fond de cuisine/broth as a basis for its marine flavoured Umami. This lack was made up by adding a large amount of cream which created a rich creaminess, but the clam flavours were lacking along with attenuated flavour of the bacon which was barely discernable. It wasn&#39;t bad, but it was a mediocre attempt by a restaurant that is supposedly known for its seafood  

2)  Wild Maldives Island Big Eye Tuna was like a Pesce Crudo/flavoured Sashimi dressed with fennel-orange puree, diced orange which had a nice agro-dolce flavour with the addition of fennel pollen that added a refreshing licorice undertone that seemed to have a mild numbing effect on the tongue.  Unusual treatment for raw fish which I appreciated for a flavour combination that I have never had except in pork style dishes influenced by Italian cuisine.  

3)  Wild Pacific Swordfish was simple: salted &amp; grilled on a bed of braised eggplant,tomato, black olives, rosemary oil.  The eggplant was not fully cooked so it was rather tough &amp; leathery &amp; not soft.  The white meat of the swordfish was cooked about right to where it was not over cooked, but the fish itself lacked &#34;IKI&#34;, a Japanese Sushi term that means vitality, vivaciousness, liveliness.  It had the light taste of swordfish, but lacked that ocean freshness and vitality.

4)  Farmed Texas Silver Streak Striped Bass as grilled on the skin side to crispness while the flesh was a bit too over done to create a semi dried out texture.  Also it was over salted which killed any subtle flavours the Striped Bass may have had.  Farro Risotto was misleading since Risotto usually implies a soft, creamy texture, and to our surprise, the farro turned out to be a very chewy, primitive, rough, rustic grain.  With all the fibre in the farro, I feel assured of complete regularity the next day.

1-4a)  Our waiter had suggested the Latour &#39;La Grande Roche&#39; Chardonnay from Burgundy which had more  minerality, acidity, austerity to act as a more neutral palate cleanser compared to the richer California style which has more oak, butteriness, vanillas, sweetness which to me does not meld well with cleaner tasting seafood.

5) Bread Pudding was bland, dense, heavy in the manner of a white dwarf star topped with a caramel inflected ice cream, caramel sauce with scattering of Alaea Red Sea salt.  There was a heavy hand involved with the salt...a bit too much for a sweet dessert.  I decided to add more  flavour by ordering Frangelico, a hazelnut infused sweet liqueur which added a mild, soft, woody nutty bouquet as well as a refined sweetness to take the edge off of the excessive salt.  It worked, but the Frangelico was an extra $11.  

Unfortunately, this DineLA meal turned out to be fair to middling. For a place that was noted in its day to be a high end piscatorial restaurant, the performance today was about 3- Yelp stars.  Our waiter whose ancestors hailed from Sicilia was the bright star at Water Grill.  He was informative, conversational, fun, &amp; playful in a good natured way to improve the meal that we had."

Service was great and the restaurant is big so there was any much of a wait.  We ordered the lobster sandwich, it was good.  We also ordered the halibut and that was very good.

The interior decor has a very romanic ambiance which makes it perfect for a date night or a special occasion. The service was great and I definitely noticed their fancy towels! 
Food:
Bread: They give you some amazing complimentary sea salt bread, you must try it!
Crab Cakes: 4.5/5 I love love love crab cakes and this is a very crabby crab cake which I appreciate but just the portion was rather small. I would recommend this as an appetizer.
Oyster: 4/5 I like the sauces that come with the oysters and for a half dozen it&#39;s about $15 which is fair. They were very fresh and juicy.
Lobster Roll: 4/5 I got the traditional lobster roll over the buttery kind. I have to say this is a must try! They use real big juicy fresh lobsters! No crawfish crap! Every bite had a huge lobster in it and I enjoyed every single moment of it. 
Shrimp and grits: 3/5 I am biased about this one because I am not too much of a fan of this dish but my bf got it and he said it was alright."

We decided to come here to celebrate our anniversary because my girlfriend absolutely loves seafood.  Anyway, I booked a reservation the week prior for Saturday at 730.  

We came in a little late thanks to LA traffic.   I know what else is new!!!  We came in at 7:45 and we&#39;re seated right away.   Our server Zahava is pretty nice as she gave us a run through of the menu.  

We ordered the following:
2 lbs Spiny lobster - char grilled to perfection.   They did not soak this in butter so it was quite flavorful.  A bit on the pricey side at $44 a pound but I highly recommend it for the experience.  

Chilean Sea Bass - Slightly grilled where the top is quite crunchy and the inside is nice and soft.  Honestly, this is probably the best sea bass I ever had. 

Oysters: ordered the Pope&#39;s Bay, Fanny Bay, and Conway Cup.   Out of the three, I prefer the Conway cup.   Also, they give you cocktail sauce, vinaigrette, and radish sauce on the side.  

Bread Pudding with red salted caramel -  this is pretty solid.  Presentation is good and probably their best dessert.

Other tips: they have free WiFi which is useful if you have crappy signals.   Also, the ice tea is $4 a pop for all the penny pinchers.  Lol.   

We also did Valet parking."

Parking is in the rear but i didn&#39;t know that till i got up to the door. My mistake. The sign says they open at 11:30 and I showed up around 12:40 and they were gated shut. I heard people inside so I waited a bit and the guy opened up the doors and apologized so no harm, no foul. 
Our waiter was very...talkative. we were seated with menus and before i could really look it over he took it from my hands and asked me to tell him about myself. I don&#39;t know about you but I&#39;ve never had to take a personality quiz to order a burger. I didn&#39;t quite know how to respond so he just started talking about what was on the menu and asked me what kind of things I liked. Spicy? Sweet? Salty? He talked to us way to long and when other customers came in he obviously knew them and was talking to them from across the restaurant about how he was on new medication. Strange service.
He came back to us and asked us about drinks.
I knew he was just trying to be friendly and helpful but I really wanted to look over the menu myself at some point. He eventually handed it back to me and though the menu was clear on description of the food i wish it had the prices of the burgers cuz as good as the burger was I might have ordered something that wasn&#39;t $23.00
It did take forever to get out of there though. Our waiter disappeared into the back leaving this older woman to man 3 tables. She had a hard time walking and obviously wasn&#39;t used to this kind of work. she brought us our check but took 20 minutes to come pick it back up again with me calling over multiple times and her not hearing me. She was very busy with the custom orders of a different table so I understand but at the same time I just wanted to leave already. 
It was also very hard for her to understand that my friend and I wanted to split the meal down the middle. She kept asking who ordered what and we repeatedly told her it didn&#39;t matter cuz we were splitting it evenly. We gave in when explaining it didn&#39;t help and just paid for it how she wanted. I asked for a box that never came so eventually just walked up and got one. 

Again the food was good but they have to get some better staff to make things less awkward and run smoother."

Yes, this place deserve it.  I found out about this restaurant when searching hamburgers on Yelp. And of course the name caught my attention.  &#34;What in the heck is a Frickadell?&#34;

Well. it turns out it&#39;s a small burger joint in east LA. As I entered the restaurant I was greeted my a lovely Latina.  Then the owner, who&#39;s funny and cool, took my order.  He asked how hungry was I?  Glad he asked that because I can&#39;t physically finish a huge burger.  So as he suggested,  I ordered two sliders and the feta garlic fries.  The wait was kind of long, but fresh food can&#39;t always be thrown together. 

I was shown my food before it was placed in a bag. I was so excited to see two hefty sliders dressed in a fluffy buns, melted cheese, pickles, a slice of tomato and red onions. And my fries, OMG!  Fresh cut wedge fries coated in roasted garlic and feta cheese crumbles.  The smell was intoxicating! I opted for my order to go. I couldn&#39;t drive fast enough back to work to dig in!

As expected, every bite was delicious!  The hamburger patty was seasoned well and I was full after eating one. I liked the fact the garlic on the fries is roasted or sautéed. Because I&#39;ve had other garlic fries and not cooking the garlic well can make eating the fries unpleasant, or worse, leaving you with a strong case of funky breath.

F&amp;F also serve cheesecake in a jar (decadence in a small jar), chicken wings and many different burgers and fries. 

I&#39;m so happy this place is near my job and I plan to return many times."

I want to start with the positives- the burger was quite good. It&#39;s a four star burger. The fries are ok but a bit greasy. I enjoyed the guac fries especially. 

As good as the burger was though, I can&#39;t give more than three stars because the service and wait time is two stars at best. 
I wouldn&#39;t mind the 30+ minute wait for the burger if the service and overall appeal of the place was good - it isn&#39;t. 

The woman who was working the register was disorganized and very VERY slow. There was a young man waiting to order when I got there and she kept saying she&#39;d be right with him while she did a myriad of seemingly unimportant tasks. She took his order after about 8 minutes of that. The kid was 90 cents short. Rather than wait any longer, I offered to cover it. 

When I ordered, it honesty took longer than it should have. She would read stuff back incorrectly. When she added up the total, it was clear that she was struggling. She then included the 90 cents in my total and charged me that plus tax. It&#39;s a dollar and some change, no big deal, but I shows me she isn&#39;t properly trained to run the register. 

While I was ordering a pair of burgers were put in the window. The lady didn&#39;t even acknowledge them for about 10 minutes. I actually considered going back to the counter to tell her. 
She didn&#39;t give us our drinks, the didn&#39;t clear ANY of the tables that were covered in the last patrons trash, I had to wipe down the table myself. 

Look, for a me to pay $25 for two burgers, fries and one soft drink, the tables should be cleaned off after a few minutes. The service really killed what would have been a good experience if the food was able to be the focus. It wasn&#39;t. 

I really hope the owner trains his staff better so that this doesn&#39;t happen again."

At first hesitant due to we have rarely gone down to east los angeles, especially just to eat.
Freeway was jammed on the way,  we were hungry,  we almost decided to eat near by.
Well.. after eating there and being more than satisfied with the food, it was worth it. 5 stars to the family for the best hamburger and fries, plus hot wings  we have ever hade.
We will be back with rest of family soon.

Thank you for this meal we have had today."

The first thing I noticed is the place was clean and had an A, so I thought &#34;lets try it!&#34; 
We ordered the following: 8 wings- half buffalo and half zesty lime. The El Chiloso burger and the Avocado salad with cilantro lime dressing. YUM!!! Everything was soooo good! The service was great! The dressing is made to order. Everything is made to order that&#39;s why there is a wait. Hey, I&#39;d rather wait for food that&#39;s being cooked rather than warmed up.

I live in Texas, so it was my first visit to the restaurant.  I ate here on August 10 &amp; 11, 2016. 

August 10--- I had the bacon burger and garlic feta fries. OMG! Before this burger, I had not had one in at least 5 years and this was the best cheat ever. The bacon is mixed into the beef and so every bite is  a bite of swiney goodness (swiney is now an official word). From the bun to the fresh lettuce, onion and tomato , everything was incredible. My cousin and I, her first visit as well, were silent through the meal except for the occasion pre-historic grunts we made.  She has the Cali burger and it disappeared right before my very eyes. 

Day 2 Aug 11----- I went back for the Wet Spicy Lime fries. With a name like that how can you resist driving from Riverside?  I got the Trio----equal portions of guacamole smothered fries, the wet spicy lime (this stuff is nirvana), and fries covered in shredded cheese. All the fries are all hand cut ( I can vouch for this because I know the owner). These fries are the best thing that has ever happened to my taste buds. The cool guac and the indescribable flavor of the lime sauce is *&amp;*&amp;&amp;^^%$%. And who doesn&#39;t like cheese? This is definitely one of the best dishes I&#39;ve ever had. Oh, and the chicken sliders? Have some. 

The atmosphere is great and EVERYTHING is made to order ( back to that knowing the owner thing). The presentation is wonderful and care is taken to make sure your order is just right. Seriously, some good eats!"

Also, I had to wait way too long after calling in my order.  I called in my order at 11:30.  They said to give them 15 mins.  I got there at 11:50 and it wasn&#39;t ready.  I had to wait another 15 mins.  This was my lunch break and this is precisely why I called it in.  I don&#39;t understand all the great reviews.  The burger was not even in my top 20.

I didn&#39;t even try the other fancy named burgers which I will by the way, but to have just a regular cheeseburger be that flavorful, you can only imagine how good the other ones are. Let&#39;s not forget the fries too, they&#39;re were seasoned just right. Also I wanted to add that the people working there were very nice and friendly.

I ordered the Joshua Tree because I was borderline hangry and it sounded like a hefty burger -- and it was! A juicy lucy (cheese inside and on top) with avocado and bacon? Color me ecstatic! The burger was made-to-order and it was executed well. Even better? The avocado and bacon were plentiful! This was a good slice of avo and some seriously thick-cut bacon -- I could hear my arteries clogging but I didn&#39;t care. The fries were tasty but a little on the  side (ok, a lot on the greasy side)...I did the napkin pat down that some do with pizza to relieve me of some of my guilt for eating them.

The place could use some non-wobbly tables and chairs, that would help a little. Also, the organization was lacking. I walked in and waited for few minutes before anyone acknowledge me (one person was serving food to another table and there was no one else in front). Eventually, when she acknowledged me she gave me a menu, told me to have a seat, asked if it was my first time, and then said she&#39;d help me in a second. She never came back (and there was only one other table of customers). Fortunately, however, another employee came and took my order. I don&#39;t know why the &#34;Is this your first time here&#34; question is asked if there&#39;s no follow up....but I digress.

Other than this disorganization, I enjoyed this place. The food is damn tasty but it is a li&#39;l pricey -- did we forget we&#39;re in East LA, Frikadelles &amp; Frites? I mean, it&#39;s good, but we ain&#39;t there yet! I wanted to excuse some of the kinks as growing pains, but according to the server, this place has been there for a year-and-a-half...so what&#39;s the excuse? :P 

I would definitely consider going back, I just hope they can work out the kinks before i return: less grease, improved customer services, and a better price point."

The restaurant is small but not cluttered, it has great music and it has a nice patio to dine on as well. If you&#39;re driving too fast down Whittier, you&#39;ll pass it right up...so slow down.
The service is friendly and it seems like the the workers are related some how. They all appear to work pretty well together.
My only negative comment is that I didn&#39;t get the correct fries with my order. I sent it back once and still didn&#39;t get what I ordered so I ate it anyway. They were goodness."

   We ordered the juicy Lucy and it is HUGE and the meat was soo juicy and flavorful! I felt super full because I actually ate the whole thing! Everything tasted fresh like a homemade burger but with gourmet ingredients.The fries are steak fries made in house I could see them peeling the potatoes and those were great also!

The person who helped my fiancé and I, I think it was the owner, talked to us about the menu and gave us his favorites. He explained how he has designed and made every burger there. We ordered and waited. 

The place does seem a bit run down and there are a few places to sit inside, but they have a little courtyard/patio with more tables. The owner checked on us periodically and brought the food out too.

I ordered the Italian burger and my fiancé ordered the chuck Norris; both of which was phenomenal. They were both juicy and delicious in their own ways. My one regret is not being able to finish all my food.

Members in attendance: Angela d., Sumana S., Trevor Y., Wayne T., Dennis K.

I. Ordering
We ordered the 12 piece wings ($11) to start. You can have multiple sauces, which is nice. We ordered half hot wings and half BBQ wings. Trevor and I ordered a Juicy Lucy ($11), which comes with four cheeses inside and on top of the patty. It also comes with frites. Wayne, Sumana, and Dennis all ordered the Joshua Tree ($15) which was the juicy lucy with avocado and bacon on a pretzel bun. 

II. The burgers
The burger patties were beautiful. They were really meaty and really well seasoned. I could really taste the pepper. They were definitely NOT loose packed because of the avalanche of cheese inside, which gave this patty a tougher texture. We had a mix of doneness in our patties. Some were cooked medium and others were well done. We were never asked how we wanted our burgers. Let&#39;s get to the cheese! It was a beautiful blend and nice and molten inside. Be careful when biting in because the cheese can burn you (one of the beautiful dangers of eating a Juicy Lucy).  Cheese can sometimes overpower the meat flavor in a burger patty, but not here. They worked perfectly together. The toppings were all pretty good. I really LOVED the sauce they had on the juicy lucy. The others really liked the avocado and mentioned it was super fresh. However, there was some complaint about the bacon. Some thought there was too much bacon. And it seemed like there was some ham that snuck onto the burgers; unless it was just really really thick cut bacon. The bacon is also not crispy, but more chewy. The buns were nice and gooey and the pretzel bun held up a little better than the bun on the Juicy lucy. One more thing, these burgers are HUGE!

III. The fries
Wayne made it a point to say these are NOT fries, they are wedges. Yes, these are thick cut. However, I think they were perfectly seasoned. I also had a quite a few thinner wedges in my basket, which were nice and crispy.

IV. Miscellaneous
This place is unassuming. You&#39;d pass right by it if you didn&#39;t know what you were looking for. There is some indoor and outdoor seating. I recommend sitting outside if you are eating there because they don&#39;t have central air conditioning yet. The owner assured us it was coming though. However, when sitting outside, you have to contend with the flies and mosquitos. A fly landed on my burger (gross) and Sumana got eaten alive by mosquitos! I highly recommend that you order to go!

The menu was a little confusing. On the inside, they have the names of all the burgers and prices, but the descriptions are all separated on the back of the menu (so I was constantly flipping back and forth). They also don&#39;t list all the prices for all the burgers. 

They also serve other things like sliders, wings, salads, and quesadillas. They also serve various toppings on the fries (ex. feta, bacon, garlic, etc). The wings we got were very good! Nice and meaty with a lot of sauce! They seemed like they were grilled instead of fried. The wings did not make it on to our check. Perhaps the owner gave it to us for free since the wait was a little on the long side (which I notice is a trend among other reviewers). Speaking of the owner, he is a little . . . quirky. He talked about the fact that he was giving us conscious water (love and gratitude). It seemed like he was trying hard to get us to have a good time, which I can appreciate, but some of the things he was talking about were a little . . . unconventional. He also gave us a free cheese cake in a jar at the end of our meal. It was pretty good!

V. Value
This was a great value since the burgers were HUGE and they come with fries. The juicy lucy especially at $11 is a steal!

VI. The verdict
Excellent Juicy Lucy! It was everything a Juicy Lucy should be! However, make sure to order to go! The ratings: 3.6, 3.8, 4.4, 4.6, 4.7.

Something about the MEAT makes this burger stand out. Not that I don&#39;t like the gourmet ones. I just haven&#39;t tried them. 4 or 4.5 stars for the burger. 

As for the fries, I felt that they were just OK. They could use more crisp. I know some chefs blanch their fries (fry them once and let the oil soak in) and throw them back into the fryer some minutes later

Aside from the food, the service good. It is definitely not bad. James is a great guy. I get a really good vibe from him and the place in general, but sometimes service from the other staff can be less than great. Maybe James just sets a high standard! 

The decor is very homey too. The place is compact but I don&#39;t mind too much.

Some people complain that the wait time is too long but it takes a THICK patty(at least thicker than the flimsy In N&#39; Out patty) at least 10 minutes to cook in general. That&#39;s without all the toppings. I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll get better at cooking faster as time goes on.

Final Verdict: 4 out of 5 stars
Expect to wait for great food!"

We drove right past this place so many times without any idea of its presence, it wasn&#39;t until YELP suggested it as a dinner recommendation that I even knew it existed! 

The place is in a strange row of smog shops and taco shops but it&#39;s a hidden gem worth stopping in at. They have a few tables inside and even a cute outside seating area. 

My boyfriend ordered the Juicy Lucy and I got the Cali burger. Both were amazing!!! The minute you get your fries you can smell the flavor. If you don&#39;t have a big appetite I suggest sharing or getting something on the lighter side because one burger is more than plenty for two. Halfway through my burger my boyfriend had to ask me if I had even taken any bites out of it because the entire top bun was still intact. I definitely was taking bites though because it was one of the best Cali burgers I have ever had. The bacon is the most delicious thick cut bacon you will ever find on a burger and I swear for a minute I was in heaven. 

It is a bit on the pricy side so that also contributes to possibly sharing if you just want to have a decent size lunch or dinner. 

We will definitely be back again to try some of the secret menu items we heard about!! (Juicy Lucy on a pretzel bun?! Yes, please!)"

I&#39;ve never seen this place before so decided to give it a shot. Best decision i ever made. They have a good selsction of burgers and sides from regular fries, garlic fries, bacon and cheddar potato wedges, wings, salads etc. I decided to order the Joshua tree which came with fries. The joshua tree burger was stuffed with 4 different cheeses, then it had more cheese on the outside of the patty(i know it sounds like a lot of cheese, but believe me it was delicious). Anyway it also had bacon, and avocado. One of the best if not the best burger ive ever had. It was delicious, really flavorful and juicy. The fries were also really good. The owner and/or cook was really nice also and a cool dude. I highly recommend this place to any burger lover out there, or to anyone thats hungry.

The reason i&#39;m giving 4 stars and not 5 is because the service could use some improvement. But over all. Loved the food. Will definitely be back."

The juicy Lucy, wrangler and Joshua tree   None disappointed.  ALL WELL ENJOYED. 
And they have these mini cheesecakes in a jar. Sweet potato, blueberry and strawberry all very good and perfectly small portioned for after a great meal.

I was a little skeptical about this place at first but decided to try it based on the great yelp reviews. Let me tell you, they totally delivered on producing a great burger and fries. I&#39;m impressed!

It turns out that they take pride in the quality of ingredients they use. Freshly ground beef from a local meat market that grinds it fresh for them. Also, buns baked fresh from Homeboy Industries.

It&#39;s apparent they go out of their way to produce a great product which is evident in the freshness and quality you taste once you bite into a hearty burger and taste their freshly cut fries.

Aside from their food product they deliver, it&#39;s still a fairly new establishment so their are a few kinks that need to be worked out. I&#39;m confident that these minor things will be addressed so that one can enjoy an overall A+ 5 star experience.

This review is based on their food product alone. I&#39;m looking forward to going back and trying something different."

Once inside I asked to sit outside because my boys had just finished a football camp and was sweaty so indoor was not a good idea. The server was very nice and patient with my boys who would not stop talking, LOL. My boys ordered chicken and burger sliders and I ordered their bacon burger. The burgers were very tasty and the fresh steak fries were a big hit. The boys were determined to bring mom to dinner here because it was awesome.

If I could go simply half, 2.5/5, I would. Okay, they&#39;re pretty disorganized when I arrived. I just wanted a to go order. They clearly don&#39;t get many of those, because they said they didn&#39;t have a to-go menu, before giving me a normal menu. 

The place itself: 1/5
Okay, my complaints. I went on a Thursday night, my food took a decent amount of time but that&#39;s fair, there were a good amount of people there. My biggest thing: there were little gnats, and small flies EVERYWHERE inside. There were hundreds of them. I do not exaggerate in any way. The table near me I couldn&#39;t even sit on because they were overrunning the surface. They leave their door open and have a large patio entrance that they also leave wide open. As a result, you couldn&#39;t walk a few feet without touching a group full of gnats. It was disgusting. They were all over the table. The staff did nothing about this. There is no doubt in my mind if a health inspector saw that he/she would lose their mind. I had serious doubts about getting my food because of the huge amount of gnats everywhere inside. I do not think those eating outside experienced this, but it was disgusting to see inside.

Thankfully.. I took my food to go, although accepting my food reluctantly.

Price: 3/5 (nearly $20 for my items).
Food itself : 4/5

I got the Joshua Tree burger and the trio fries
I wish I just got the spicy fries, these were really good! The lime is a really good touch and it&#39;s pretty spicy. The guac and cheese fries were just ok, enjoyable but just ok. The burger itself, holy moly, it&#39;s HUGE. The patty is probably like 4 normal patties thick. I could not believe it. It&#39;s filled with cheese inside the meat and on top of it. I literally knew that I could only eat half, and that would probably still be too much. But it was good burger. Tasty, the cheese was good, and everything else blended well. It was a bit much, but very tasty no doubt. 

Overall.. mixed feelings. Seeing where and how my food was made, made me doubt the quality. But the food itself, pretty good. I just hope the kitchen wasn&#39;t as gross as the dining room was.."

No one in there right mind cloud choke this stuff down and the place is dirty unkept!!)
I was looking forward to the food. The worst part of my whole experience was the food !! Salty on a whole mother level!! Sauce tasted like it expired  a month ago. Over cooked oh and did  I mention over salted. Owner came out was nice at first he asked me how I liked the food and the restaurant 
I gave him my honest and polite take on what I ate and the feel of the place. This man turned in to a woman got really sassy and mean!! Offered me a refund ( I didn&#39;t ask for one ) I then said thank you I had such a over all bad experience that I had to.
He regretted what he said and tried everything to get out of returning my $34 he said his machine want working, he didn&#39;t know how to work it, he then said ok I&#39;ll refund you half after dealing with this diva ( he&#39;s a guy) I said fine half is cool 
He then returned $15 which is not half of $34 
I politely said thank you and walked out as he smerked and gave me a death look. This place failed in every area - food, presentation, ambiance, customer service, cleanliness etc

This review has nothing to do with the quality of the food served. In fact the food was great! This review is to address the customer service or lack thereof. So, we arrived and found this place to be a little dark in the main eating area. We then chose to sit ourselves outside on a dirty table. We were then greeted about 10 minutes later and asked what we wanted to drink. 10 minutes later (still sitting on a dirty table) the &#34;waitress&#34; returns with an iceless cup of water and a can of soda missing a cup of ice (Sigh but I&#39;m over it) and says &#34;I&#39;ll be back to clean the table&#34;. She returned about 10 minutes later to take our order (still dirty table), we placed our orders and waited, waited and waited some more. I kid you NOT... 45-50 minutes later to the initial 25-30 waited and after I walked up to the unmanned front counter to ask &#34;how much longer?&#34; We were told &#34;just five more minutes, did you guys still want to wait? This kind of food still has to cook&#34; lol so our food arrives which looks amazing and as we were about to devour our long awaited epic meal, a long hair wrapped around my gf&#39;s burger. This was such a let down but ok we were over it. We send the food back and share the remaining dish. The food was excellent. It was finger licking good, no complaints here. 20 minutes later, we get the second dish. At this point we were so tired of waiting we asked for a &#34;to go&#34; box. Here&#39;s my thing, if you are waiting for so long and obvious errors were made, wouldn&#39;t you expect that the establishment be a little more courteous to its patrons? I am blessed and can afford to pay for my meals but after so many incidents I think any customer would&#39;ve left and damn near demanded their money back. I just feel that the &#34;management&#34; who ever that might be should be a little more aware and give their attention to their customers and take care of new customers as we are the ones contributing to their success. I know I am just one customer but I went to this place because of all of the past reviews. Customers are giving them 5 star reviews and I believe that the least this establishment can do is deliver their end of the bargain! Give us 5 star service if you want 5 star reviews. That&#39;s all!!"

An orgasm in the mouth.

Yeah, I&#39;ll go with that.

The restaurant has been closed for over a month because someone decided that they should throw the flower pots through the glass doors, which are expensive to replace. Real classy, folks. This is why it&#39;s so hard for us to have nice things.

The owner is friendly and takes pride in his work. The restaurant is clean and welcoming and just waiting for you to drop by.

The wingz at Juicy Wingz are about az flavorlesz and dry az using the letter &#39;z&#39; in place of the letter &#39;s&#39;; a marketing tactic created by idiotz for idiotz. 

Juicy Wingz leaves it up to you to decide if what you&#39;re eating is pure gristle, or meat that has been so thoroughly over-fried that every bite tastes like you&#39;re chewing through the sun-baked corpse of some bird that died in the Sahara weeks ago. I&#39;ve tried the mild buffalo, the garlic buffalo, the mango habanero, and the garlic parmesan (all bone-in classic style). The sauces (saucez) are so mild and indistinguishable that no matter what you choose, no amount of flavor can overpower the taste of what I can only describe as fried sand on what may or may not be a chicken bone. 

Looking past the obscene lack of flavor and stupid name, you don&#39;t even get what you pay for. This is the kind of place where you&#39;ll order 12 wings, get 8 actual chicken wings, and 4 oddly shaped pieces of...something. Slather it in blue cheese (or ranch if you&#39;re a fucking terrorist) and pray that it&#39;s over soon. 

I read some reviews saying their burgers are good...I haven&#39;t tried their burgers (burgerz) so I can&#39;t comment on this, but if it&#39;s true, why not call it Juicy Burgerz instead? That way, you can at least spare people the mouth holocaust so ironically advertised in the name."

Wings - the name was misleading. I didn&#39;t get any juicy wings and they weren&#39;t as great as expected for someone who puts Wingz in their name. 

We tried the chicken and waffles wings. Without checking Yelp, I assumed it would be chicken and waffle flavored wings or something similar haha! To my liking, it was wings with maple syrup and a waffle on the bottom with more maple syrup and butter. The wings were dry and barely had any meat on them :( the waffle was super soggy and I don&#39;t think it was from all the maple syrup. If the waffle were crunchier, it would&#39;ve made up for the wings. I think the wings were over cooked because it took more than 15 mins just for my 10 wings to come out ;(

We also ordered buffalo garlic... And I think we got just regular hot wings somehow. There were no pieces of garlic or even a hint of garlic in them :( the taste of vinegar in the hot wings is so much different than garlic. 

I would suggest getting the burgers here, they looked good, but I am very sad the wings were not juicy as their name implies!"

We ordered the  12 wings - 6 buffalo wings and 6 lemon pepper wings. Each wing was really JUICY, hence the name. They threw in an extra wing - DOUBLE POINTS!

Also, ordered maple, bacon fries. I thought the fries were going to be regular potatoes, but was disappointed when it was sweet potato. It was overall too sweet for me. I felt like it would have been so much better if they were regular potatoes.

I let them know they should kick it up a few notches. What was cool, was you can order large orders I think you can order up to 500 or so.

Sweet potato fries- have no idea if they were good or not-it had  cinnamon all over it, and I wish I knew that before, since I am allergic to it, may be it should be mentioned. Chicken wings-.... Don&#39;t order it- that&#39;s all I can say. I love spicy food, love that hot tingling felling, which you get from it. So I tried one wing 20 min ago, my face is still burning, couldn&#39;t taste any flavors and couldn&#39;t get enough of water- waste. So it is 2 dishes out of 3 went to the trust.

It was really late (all the bars had closed) and we just wanted to get some late night food to go and go home. I ordered a burger and fried pickles because they said they didn&#39;t have pickles to put on burgers, only fried ones...cool. 

I waited an insane amount of time, at least 25 minutes. My number was 33, and order numbers: 59, 37, 41, etc, ALL got called before me. Other customers around were complaining about that as well, clearly wondering where their orders were. 

When I finally got my food, I just grabbed the bag and left because it had taken so long, but when we got home my burgers bun was burnt so badly it was BLACK and they didn&#39;t even give me the fried pickles I paid $6 freaking extra dollars for. 

Absolutely ridiculous. Hands down the worst, most overpriced meal I&#39;ve ever had. I had to throw the majority of it out it was so bad (the bun crunched like a cracker when I bit into it) and I literally never do that. 

Additionally I&#39;ve been trying to call the restaurant to get a refund and I&#39;ve been told for 3 days straight that the managers are not in whenever I have called.

When we approached them about it, they made more fun of us in Spanish, except this time out of our view. The &#34;manager&#34; at the time barely apologized, gave us no refund, and left us be.

Lol! Of course it&#39;s Hollywierd so there were definitely some characters in there. 

We ordered the lemon pepper, spicy yaki, and honey BBQ. The spicy yaki and honey BBQ were very similar in taste. The lemon pepper were my favorite. They had the most flavor. 

Basically, i wouldn&#39;t rush back! If I was drunk on Hollywierd and happened to walk past it while being hungry I would think about it but depends on my other options."

Yes, the burger was good however I don&#39;t understand how or why it was good?  When I saw the kitchen and the way the place was ran I was a little skeptical.  The location for Juicy Wingz is also pretty crazy on a Friday night at 1am.  That is when I went.

Lots of crazy people around outside and wandering inside the restaurant.  I was asked for money by panhandlers a few times and, although not Juicy Wingz fault does subtract a star for the experience.

They forgot my French fries on my order too, and I had to drive back to get them.  It was an ordeal.  I would probably have liked this burger more if I didn&#39;t know where it came from."

Our wings came and numerous parts of them were naked, i.e. Not tossed in the sauce very well. They weren&#39;t crispy or particularly hot. I got a combo of sauces they were just tossed in there all together with the little sauce that was on there mixing together. 

As soon as I looks at my food I could tell it wasn&#39;t made with care. And for that i just can&#39;t continue to patronize this establishment. 

I guess to Wingstop I go."

It is open really late. Also the price was fair. We got the family pack of 30 pieces of boneless chicken, which came with 3 flavors! We got lemon pepper, I believe the sweet and spicy, and buffalo garlic. Lemon pepper and sweet and spicy were my favorites! The chicken was crisp and flavorful. I felt that the buffalo garlic was lacking in garlic, but the chicken itself was fine. The fries are really similar to wing stop in their consistency and taste. Place was pretty empty when we came in around 11pm-12am on a Friday so we got our order quickly!"

We never exchanged info so I never got a chance to thank them! 
Thank you if you are out there reading this. 
This burger was legit! Grease, cheese and meat. I was upset that they ran out of ciabatta bread, but will try next time! 
BY THE WAY, I was told NOT to order the large fries since they were too big. Did I listen? No, my stomach won. Large fries are way too big for two people to share. We had leftovers for days! Stick to the small size, don&#39;t be a glutton like me!"

Such a same that they would let him answer the phone and run the front desk they need to put him in the back where he is not interacting with customers. Or just simply let him go as I&#39;m looking at other yelpers reviews that share the same view as me. Your business is only as good as your weakest employee. Obviously he is not taking anybody&#39;s feedback or complaints and addressing them to change for the better. I order from this place like 3 times a week and have all my friends ordering since this place is open until 4am. Great food I love all the wing flavors burgers and the chicken Caesar salad. I hope they hire friendlier staff the key to running a successful business is great customer service. I don&#39;t care how good the food is bad customer service will sure ruin a appetite.

The majority of the reviews I read on Yelp are typically ridiculous and over the top full of picky  a$$ complainers. So I was turned off to comment online... I&#39;m only 29, but I&#39;m old school and all about telling the owners how AWESOME their food was...

But in this case I felt compelled to write a review. The chicken was freakin&#39; PHENOMENAL! Full of flavor, juices, fresh, hot and freakin&#39; delicious 

I had the sweet &amp; spicy chili, my girl thought it was ehhh. On the other hand I loved it, the sauce had a quick hit of sweetness &amp; then bit me in the end with some spice! KILLER!

And then I had the &#34;Chicken n&#39; Waffles&#34; WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW  

The chicken was so juicy, with the Belgian waffle and syrup. Perfect, like dirty south perfect. 407, reppin&#39; 

Overall I highly recommend this place, I can&#39;t wait to hit them up again and try some of their other flavors!"

The brioche bun is buttery and soft, while the patty is greasy, messy, and has a great beefy taste (the way I like it ;) just got the original burger for 5 bucks with fries and chipotle ketchup. don&#39;t need all those fancy toppings.

Although their customizable menu is definitely a plus, this place is merely a safe option if you happen to be on Hollywood Blvd looking for a quick bite. Juicy is really like wannabe actor cousin of 5 guys burgers.
You can choose between 2 sizes of beef patties, chicken, turkey, along with choices of bread, condiments, and extra toppings.

I remember the first time eating here many years ago when I first started coming out to the area. But now with a multitude of burger joints, Juicy burger is left behind as a choice for passersby. They&#39;re not bad at all, but there&#39;s better. However, $10 for a burger with a fried egg and fries in Hollywood is a pretty good deal."

- The first thing that threw us off was the fact that on the paper they gave us to mark off our orders they have the &#34;Blue Cheese&#34; option. When the order came out, it was Blue Cheese Dressing. They argued that it wasn&#39;t an issue because that is how it is displayed on the receipt, but what does that matter? If the option on the menu says &#34;Blue Cheese&#34; that is exactly what we are expecting. They need to change that option to &#34;Blue Cheese Dressing&#34; because it was very disappointing. 

- The other issue we had was there was an option for a salad wrap. Basically they would take the order and wrap it in lettuce rather than a bun. Unfortunately they were not able to provide that option for the night, which is fine. However, instead of letting us know they gave us a burger with onion rings sitting on top of a small amount of lettuce and mostly spinach. We had to go back and ask for a replacement bun. Would have been nice if they would have let us know beforehand and asked how we else we can modify it, rather then just taking the lazy way out and slapping whatever they had left on the tray.

- Lastly, and quite simply, the service just was not very good. It was a bit on the slow side. I had ordered a bottled water that I never got so we had to spend time ensuring that I wasn&#39;t charged for it because at that point anything could go wrong. 

I felt a bit bad for complaining about the issues we were having while we were there because I understand that there is only so much a business can do. What was uncalled for was the attitude of the cook who thought no one can see or hear him. It felt like anytime we asked for something he was being inconvenienced. 

It just seems like the great hangout we had with great service and amazing food is gone. Sure some of the menu items are still there but everything we used to love about the place is gone and has been replaced with unnecessary renovations. It makes no sense to make the place look pretty if everything else is going to be below average.

**Almost forgot to add a couple of us began to have stomach issues later that night and the morning after. Might have been the milkshakes."

I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich with swiss cheese added. Chicken was juicy, tasted very fresh, and cooked to order. It took a little longer than expected, but it was well worth the wait as fresh chicken takes time to fry. Their french fries were delicious as well! Don&#39;t know what flavor they put on them, but I loved it. The chicken and waffles boneless wings were delicious as well. Definitely go BONELESS! The boneless wings are basically chicken breast fried in crispy batter.

My review is from the perspective of someone who needs to go into a burger shop and order a lettuce wrap and only include toppings that are natural and sugar free. This means no ketchup, mustard or mayonnaise! And what this really means, is that the burger has to taste amazing because there&#39;s no condiments to hide it if it&#39;s bland. Juicy Burger delivered! Tasty meat, huge lettuce wrap...enough to turn the whole thing into a salad really. I think they gave me the whole head of lettuce. The grilled onions were also tasty and perfect and flavored the meal up. I&#39;m Paleo and sugar and processed food free.

This is a place where you can design your own burger to your choosing. 

You order at the counter using a slip and pick your protein of choice like 1/3 beef, turkey veggie, chicken breast. I went with the 1/3 lb. beef.

Next, you select your bun and decided on the ciabatta.

Pick your free toppings, special sauce for $0.50, cheese for $0.75 and premium toppings for $1 of which I choose to add a fried egg.

You can make it a combo with small fries and small soda for $3 more.

It came out well. Took a few moments cause they cooked it up fresh which is great.

Cool plus to the location is the magic Coke machine with a 100 favors.

they got burgers that they build for you or you can be a little Leonardo DaVinci and create your own burger art! I did not go the DaVinci route so I chose the Western Burger, however I threw in a fried egg for only a dollar more. first off the burger was stacked af! it was looking like a game of jenga. I didn&#39;t know how I could it the entire thing in my mouth. and when I took that bite, &#34;mmmmmmmmmmm&#34; was all I was thinking! the burger was honestly juicy. it lives up to the name. so juicy it was leaking! but not a bad leak, a good leak. the price was fantastic too. it was only 8 bucks (9 bucks because I added the egg). it is at the same level as umami I would say.

only thing I have to say though is that the environment is very bland. I think a nice artwork on the wall or some foliage would help. however, I was not paying to look at artwork and pretty flowers, I was paying to eat a delicious burger and that is exactly what I got!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

Nothing really special about it.  They do live up to their name though as when i took my first bite, the juice from the meat was just dripping out!

Fries are good and they give you quite a bit.  They do have a those Coke machines with like a billion flavor combinations so that was kinda cool.

I was in the neighborhood so i decided to give it a try.  I wouldn&#39;t drive all they way out to Hollywood to eat here again, especially since you have to pay for street parking and dodge the bums hanging out on the street."

Same owners.  Same menu - only now they&#39;ve added chicken wings to their lineup.  I loved their Santa Fe Chicken Sandwich - that would be pass tense - the new - and not improved chicken sandwich is far smaller than the original with a lot less chicken.  ALSO the old version of that restaurant had fresh lemonade.  Now it&#39;s the powdered lemonade without any lemon in it at all.  There really should be a law against that.

You can get a combo with burger and fries for about 8 bucks, but once you add on the cheese and anything extra, it can go over $10+.  Which is what mine ended up to be.  It was a lot of food.  The fries are really good.  Crispy and well seasoned.  I love their dipping sauces.  The burger itself was ok, it wasn&#39;t the juiciest and tastiest burger I&#39;ve had, so I was a bit disappointed.  The really awesome thing was the soda machine.  It&#39;s the one that has a gazillion choices so you can mix and match what kind of drink or soda you want.  :) Probably won&#39;t come back here again (no pop for the POs), since there are so many other burger places I&#39;ve yet to try! :)"

Seriously, the best burger I&#39;ve ever had. My boyfriend has been bragging to me about this place for over a year, and I was finally able to try it for myself not too long ago. I let him order for me since I trust his taste. I had a burger with bacon, cheese, mushrooms, onions and garlic mayo with a side of fries and a coke. AMAZING. 

The burger is truly juicy... not to mention flavorful. It was so finger-licking good! It looked delicious as well, so delicious I didn&#39;t stop myself from digging in to take a picture. The burger is huge and can be split between two moderately hungry people, but enough to fill one who has a big appetite. The fries were like fresh cut fries and they went very well with a side of garlic mayo. That garlic mayo is gold! They also have one of those newer coke vending machines where you can get a variety of different flavors from one spout. 

The price of the food here is surprisingly inexpensive. Compared to Slaters 50/50 where the concept is similar, Juicy Burger takes the cake on taste and price. Slaters is overpriced for what it is compared to Juicy Burger.

Service is quick and friendly. Only one restroom and a key from the front is required to enter. The whole restaurant is rather small, so seating can be scarce during busy hours. I highly HIGHLY recommend this place if you are looking to be sent to heaven via tastebuds!"

Hubby and I ate here before attending a party at The Redbury. Similar concept to The Counter where you choose your burger and toppings using a pad of paper. 

The guy taking our order was on top of it because he knew we were sharing and the burger came out cut in two and had an extra plate. Thanks!!

Burger was cooked &#34;medium&#34; and was tasty, fresh and &#34;juicy&#34;!!! The vegetables were fresh and everything just tasted so great together. A $6 burger + $3 to make it a combo is a great deal for this flavorful burger. Hubby said this is what &#34;Burger Lounge&#34; burgers used to taste like. And I agree!!!

French fries are cut fresh and they give you a choice of dipping sauces. I chose the Chipotle Mayo, it had a nice kick. 

The place was always busy, people coming in and out. But not too busy that the food wait was too long. So that&#39;s also a plus!"

Knowing myself, I am always up to taking the vision of someone else and doing it myself. With a busy day in Hollywood, why not grab a bite to eat at Juicy Burger.

Located a couple blocks west of Hollywood/Vine Red Line Station on the corner of Hollywood and Ivar, you&#39;ll find a futuristic looking burger joint. This Juicy Burger is the main location of the two. The dining area seems very intimate, but I can see this place can get very busy after a night out at the clubs. There are lounge type seating or you can sit at bar-area type counter.

I was greeted by Ricardo when I entered. For a first time, I wanted to try Juicy Burger&#39;s menu. You also have your choice of making your own burger. You can fill out a form and there is no wrong answer. Just think of it as the DMV Written Test, but you&#39;ll get a burger at the end. I ordered Juicy Burger&#39;s Western Burger with Fresh Cut Fries with a small lemonade ($11). Ricardo asked what kind of dipping sauce I would want. I wasn&#39;t sure, but I asked for his recommendation and he suggested, &#34;Chipotle Mayo&#34;. So, I went with his suggestion. It was a good suggestion.

The wait would be about 6-8 minutes since I had asked for my burger to be cook medium rare. To be honest, I haven&#39;t had a &#34;Beef&#34; Burger in a long while. Usually, its a turkey or veggie burger. I had no idea what I was going to get myself into. There is a modern soda fountain machine that serves 100 different Coca-Cola Products. I didn&#39;t get to use it besides getting ice for the lemonade. Based off of the reviews, there is a charge to refill.

My name was called and I saw my very Juicy Western Burger with the huge amount of fresh cut fries. I haven&#39;t seen this much of a burger in a long time. I saw the burger soaked in BBQ sauce and my special request of extra red onion strings. I knew then and there that I could not leave Juicy Burger without finishing it. The burger&#39;s bun is freshly made and reminds me of Carl&#39;s Jr&#39;s recent new promotion of their house made buns. The beef patty was huge. Especially when you ask for your meat to still be moving. I took a bite and it was beyond juicy. I couldn&#39;t tell if it was my saliva or the beef juices or the BBQ sauce that was making the burger savory. I knew that I had to come back to try my own burger.

In addition to the burger, the House Cut Fries were the surprise to me. I was thinking it was just plain fries, but these fries are just as good as In-N-Out. I had forgotten to use the Chipotle Mayo with my burger, but I used my french fries as the dipping sauce. The Chipotle May added some heat and I loved it. With the lemonade, it all balanced out. I was surprised to get a lot of fries. I think you can make a meal with just the fries alone.

This visit was based on suggestions from my friend and Juicy Burger&#39;s employee, Ricardo. As I mentioned, I do plan to come back and Create My Own Juicy Burger. A couple hours after my visit, my stomach decided to get upset with me. With a smaller stomach, I guess I couldn&#39;t handle the Juicy Burger. I was glad that I decided to walk to Hollywood/Highland Station versus going to next door&#39;s Hollywood/Vine Station. I do hope Juicy Burger may expand to the San Fernando Valley area. Even if its just one store.

Juicy fruit (Juicy)
Juicy.....

I know that the lyrics are old skool, but this place is a bit of a throwback.  Juicy is located on the corner of Ivar and Hollywood, around the corner from Drais, Lure and Deja Vu (not that I have been to any of those places) - LOL!!!

The place is minimalist and the staff is chill, but Juicy is open til 3 am and the drunktard food is waaaaay better than Dos Burritos up the street.  After a night of debauchery (and not that long before they closed), I ordered the bacon burger ($7.50).  I added the fries and drink combo for $3 more.

The burger came out quickly, and was pretty big.  It also had an onion ring and BBQ sauce.  However, the meat was Carl&#39;s Jr quality at twice the price.  But, I still ate the whole damn thing :X:  3 Stars.  The fries were hot and plentiful, and you can choose from a variety of sauces.  I chose the spicy ketchup and it added a little kick:  3 Stars.

I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to come here, but the burgers are OK, the service is quick and the place is clean.  I guess the prices are what you have to pay for a decent place being open for an after club (regardless of the type - LMAO!!!) snack!"

Took the drive a while back, and didn&#39;t realize it was located directly on Hollywood Blvd. as I must have passed this place a bunch of times and never seen it before. Got lucky with a meter spot near the location and walked up. The placed seemed rather clean, with a few dirty tables but clean appliances, floors, walls etc. It is a real small joint with just a few tables and a new coke machine - yes the one that has a hundred different ways, lol. 

You can pick up a check-off list and create your own burger, as we did. The cool part is that they do have a good variety of different spreads as Chipotle Mayo, Garlic Aioli, Chipotle Ketchup, etc. - but no A1 for me ... awww shucks! 

The burger was juicy, so make sure you bring extra napkins to your table! The fries were similar to in n out - just a bit bigger and you get to choose a dipping sauce for your fries as well - chipotle ketchup. Burger was good in size, had a nice fresh bun that was soft and not too blan. Compared to other &#34;make your own&#34; burgers or quick gourmet takes for burgers - I think I walked out of there under $14 for burger, fries, and a drink.

Great with the French fries. The only thing I
Could warn you about is depending on all your choices going inside be sure to get napkins. It gets messy. Almost by the end of the burger my hands are soaked in sauces and lettuce. But my mouth is full of flavor no complaints here thous far. Based on the Burger selection and fries alone I am a fan. But I have not had their fresh lemonade yet or a milk shake which they also sell. They also have this really cool new futuristic fountain machine which you can pour about any drink you can think of to accompany your meal. This is a pretty good place to grab a bite to eat if your a tourist trying to grab a bite to eat or even a local who has never tried it before.

That being said, this restaurant has completely fulfilled our needs on both occasions. It&#39;s open late and centrally located - which is huge. It is fast-food-esque, which means that you can get in and out and home quickly, and you don&#39;t have to worry about splitting a check or waiting to order. The line hasn&#39;t been bad, and it moves incredibly fast. It&#39;s also really cheap for the amount of food you get.

As for the food, it is good. I would in no way ever consider it to be the &#34;best burger&#34; in LA... but it is incredibly juicy, greasy, and alcohol-absorbant. They also give you a ton of fries. My favorite part is the number of dipping sauces you can choose from. The option of chipotle ketchup in what is essentially a fast food restaurant is pretty clutch.

Horrible! I didn&#39;t know where to park or if they had a parking lot in the back. But I drove around the corner and luckily found a spot on the street.

Not sure if he was the owner but there was an older man working the cash register and he was so nice! He took the time and went through different options to see what I wanted to put on my sandwich.

I got the avocado turkey pesto sandwich with ciabatta bread. Yummm! It was so delicious! All of their ingredients tasted fresh. I ordered my food to go and it was ready in 5 minutes! So fast! 

They had a large selection of pastries / desserts. They sell fresh squeezed OJ and alcohol as well! But I think they sell alcohol because they&#39;re right next door to a hotel. Lol"

Smells like gourmet cheese once you walk in, that gut enhancing temptress. Wouldn&#39;t have noticed it without Yelp but would&#39;ve been a real miss if I had.  The inside is cozy with sofas to lounge about and a kind of cafeteria feel. A lot going on with not much.

The sandwiches here are very generous with the greens which in my opinion is a plus. They give you three different sizes and each one feels just about right. Huge selection of breads to choose from from that makes Subway look like child&#39;s play. Food tastes fresh on top of that and doesn&#39;t leave you feeling all greasy like you&#39;re still living in the 50s. My top choice when I want to be kind to my body but still want taste. 

The folks that work here are also easygoing which just adds to the atmosphere. Large selection of desserts in case you need that fix of sweets. This place doesn&#39;t necessarily wow, but it does heck all the boxes for a place to get a sandwich."

I ordered a large $10.85 Cobb Salad and it was HUGE.  Box full of fresh lettuce, tomatoes, hardboiled egg, turkey, smoked bacon, and half of a freakin&#39; avocado.   One of the better Cobbs I&#39;ve had and I&#39;ve had a lot of Cobb salads.    I couldn&#39;t finish my salad in one sitting since it was so packed of fresh goodness.

The bacon was fresh and crumbly (easily broken apart). Plenty of egg and avocado. Generous portions of chicken and greens. Thank you to the cashier who recommended that regular is more than enough for my grumbly stomach and was priced super reasonably to boot (~$8.95). 

I stopped by here for lunch since I was on jury duty. I actually swung by the 9th floor jury cafeteria and they had a really sad unfresh Cobb priced a dollar more. The 5 minute walk to Cherry Pick Cafe from the courts is totally worth it. You save a dollar and it is guaranteed to be much tastier! 

As a bonus, I also got a fresh squeezed Strawberry Lemonade and it was the right amount of sweet and tart. 

The only thing is that I don&#39;t think they have AC so it might not be the most comfortable spot to eat in on a hot day."

I mean ... hot corned beef, Russian/thousand island dressing, Swiss cheese, sauerkraut, rye bread ... the end product is considerably tastier than the mere sum of its parts.

The Reuben sandwich made at Cherry Pick Café did not disappoint. Devouring it put a smile on my face that probably did not fade for hours.

When you order it, *make sure* you select the 5oz/large meat option. It costs a pittance more than going with the 2/3oz options, and anything less than 5oz is likely to prove underwhelming when it comes time to eat.

Also, although I ordered my sandwich with rye, I should mention that I counted *23* different options for bread offered by the café. I find that level of variety simply incredible - something for everyone.

Cherry Pick Café, you salvaged what was otherwise a horrible day for me. Thank you. 

And please, *please* extend your business hours so that those of us who are not 9-5ers can have easier access to your delicious sandwiches!

The coffee is fantastic. Wow, stepped in early after checking out from the hotel next door, there are about 50 people packed in here. Obviously, this is an LA favorite. Wow. Still reeling.

Sometimes you just need a quick sandwich for lunch- well this is the place to go to. The bread is freshly baked, the deli meats are good quality, and the prices are reasonable. I highly recommend the tuna sandwiches (yes, plural because they have a variety). Usually, I stay away from tuna at any deli, but here, it&#39;s really good. The &#34;half&#34; sandwich just means &#34;half&#34; of the meat- you still get a whole sandwich out of it. A half sandwich, chips, and drink will come out to be about $10 depending on what kind of sandwich you get. I&#39;ve never tried the other items on the menu (ie. salad, soup, pizza), but they look good. This place isn&#39;t super fancy, but if you need a quick bite to eat or want something low-key, it&#39;s a great option. I also recommend this place if you want to place a large order for an office meeting- I always see them packing up food for larger to-go orders. Plus, the guy who works the cashier is super nice and attentive. He always gets my order exactly right (even when I ask for random things on the side or ask for something to be prepared differently), and he always has a great disposition. It&#39;s conveniently located near the courthouse and the state building."

I tried to order a large but the friendly cashier guy was positive that the regular size would be big enough for me.

Holiday Turkey Sandwich: had this with whole wheat and French roll; both no mayo. They DO NOT skimp out on meat, stuffing and veggie. Super delicious!

Ruben Sandwich: gota be the best ruben in the area! Lots of corn beef packed with flavor. Comes with sauerkraut, veggie and dressing. Yummy!!!

So yelped for some salad and this place came up around where I was. Good thing I decided to stop by.

Food: Ordered the Cobb Salad, Panini, Shake. All 3 were good. The amount of salad for the Cobb was really good as well. EVerything was fresh and the chicken wasn&#39;t dry~ Had the Turkey pesto panini? Pretty good. Very flavorful. One of the better paninis I&#39;ve had. As for the shake... YUM! I had the Orange juice one.. Forgot what it was called. Definitely can taste the honey and it gives it that special flavor. Goes really well together! Would definitely go there again.

Customer Service, Atmosphere and Parking:
Always had someone pick it up for me as I waited in the car. Ordered through yelp. Parking will be a major setback for this place as there is no where to park as it&#39;s downtown.

Prices:
Prices were average. maybe a dollar or so more expensive than other places but for the food and quality, it was a great deal.

After trekking to the other cafes in the area, I decided on this one and I am so glad I did.

They have free WiFi so that&#39;s definitely a plus.  Amir, who I believe is the owner, and the other staff were so friendly and helpful!  He has a great rapport with his customers as I saw him interacting with them during my stay.

Avocado Turkey Pesto - their pesto is homemade and absolutely delicious.  It&#39;s not salt laden like many of the store-bought brands and the sandwich was great for its size.  I got a regular size for $6.75 and it was perfect. 

Cappuccino Mousse Chocolate cup - cute dessert.  The cappuccino flavour, however, wasn&#39;t as pronounced as I would have liked.  For about $3.50, I believe, you get a chocolate molded cup, cappuccino mousse layered with soft sponge, and a stabilized cream.  I can say that their focus is more their savoury than sweet pastries so it&#39;s forgivable.  I really enjoyed it, I just wish the coffee flavour was stronger and that it was whipped cream instead of a stabilized cream.

Chocolate Croissant - $2.25.  I had been here for 2 or so hours at this point and Amir noticed I didn&#39;t have change and just let me have it for $2.  Pretty cool if you think about how it&#39;s my first time here.  This thing is decadent.  It looks like it doesn&#39;t have much chocolate at first but when you tear into it, there&#39;s a nice chocolate filling that isn&#39;t overwhelming but also very satisfying.  It&#39;s got a nice crispy exterior and a relatively fluffy interior (I mean, the filling obviously messes with the texture).  Definitely a good buy.

Strawberry Lemonade - I tried both the sweetened and unsweetened, and let me say that they are both delicious.  Their sweetened version isn&#39;t overly sweet like many restaurants have it.  Their unsweetened is super tart with fresh lemons and just really refreshing.  Many people may be turned off to the tartness, but with the sugar-free you can control the sweetness yourself.


Definitely stop by this place.  It&#39;s got a great atmosphere and wonderful people and food."

The food was really great, too.  I have a pretty big appetite and I got a large Turkey Avocado Pesto in a wrap and it filled me up nicely.  The pesto adds a great flavor and I like that I can get a wrap (trying to stay away from carbs!).  The ingredients were fresh and flavorful.

Look for the tall red brick building at the corner of Hill and 2nd Street with the letters Kawada Hotel on the side. 

Ordered the regular/full size Avocado Turkey Sandwich on Rye Sesame ($8.50). Very simple yet yummy sandwich, which I really love. Avocado was creamy and they don&#39;t skimp out on that. First time trying this bread and made everything taste really clean and fresh. 

Pretty big menu selection and organized well. Own section for avocado items! Also has a Protein section, which consists mostly of shakes that sound good. A large selection of bread types ranging from Sourdough to pita and honey wheat. 

Overall, great easy healthy lunch spot in the area. I think prices are decent...only slightly more pricey. Regular sandwiches aren&#39;t hugeee or anything but I&#39;ve definitely paid the same if not less for a sandwich twice the size."

I got the Avo Turkey Pesto on a French Roll, add provolone and extra pesto, no mayo. How a simple sandwich such as this can be something special may astound you: this was HEAVEN! The french roll was soft and sweetly glazed; the turkey and cheese were quality, the pesto is homemade, and the avocado is fresh and generous. Sometimes simple can be sublime, and this was!

Their food is really really fresh, and it was obvious in every bite of my avocado roast beef sandwich (~$8).  I asked them to take out the mayonaisse from the sandwich, but overall it was just quite a boring sandwich.  I feel a great sandwich is born when all the constituents of the sandwich work with each other to make this fantastic mix, kind of like in ratatouille where all the flying colors collide into flavor orgasm.  Point is, Cherry Pick Cafe&#39;s sandwiches, while very fresh, don&#39;t do that.  I feel like if I just took each component by itself I might be more satisfied, because like i said twice already, damn their stuff is fresh.  But either way, quite a satisfactory place to just kick back during a lunch break, but don&#39;t expect any friends to be mind blown if you bring them here.

I decided to get my exercise by taking the long walk from the Historic Spring District in downtown Los Angeles to Chinatown instead.  The walk is quite pleasant.  The sidewalks are fairly empty since most people drive anyway, and besides a handful of folks heading to their jobs the only people hanging out were the usual assortment of druggies and homeless persons that seem to gather in the Seventh Street area.  

The cool thing about the walk is by staying on South Hill Street it&#39;s a straight shot into Chinatown.  The Cherry Pick Café was simply there along my route.  I was foolish not to carry bottled water in my pack, but the little restaurant has bottled water, Gatorade, juices and soda for sale.  I didn&#39;t look for the hours, but it seems to be a breakfast and lunch type of café located next door to the Kawada Hotel.  This area was very isolated on a Saturday morning as there are public offices nearby but nothing else really interesting.  

There was a small assortment of pastries, croissants and muffins inside a glass display case.  I&#39;m pretty certain the baked goods are brought in from another baker.  I had a berry danish with a cup of fresh squeezed orange juice.  The pastry was fresh but rather not too extraordinary.  I loved the juice, served very cold with lots of pulp just the way I like it.

On a back counter sits a few glass containers of breakfast cereals.  It appears to be a serve-yourself type of set up, but it also appears pretty unsanitary as none of the cereal containers are sealed or covered (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K3eWASxqM57CT-hY9UTNuA?select=7cZuGy0cKMnVcXxaIOtZkw).  The cafe isn&#39;t quite as depressing as another reviewer states; although, the lights inside are rather dim.

the BEST turkey avocado bacon sandwich ever.  
amir does not skimp on the bacon!
great service.  the owner really is a nice guy.

so far i&#39;ve had their breakfast sandwich, which was super cheap and pretty tasty. 
the chicken noodle soup was deeeelicious.
i had some kind of lemonade.  i can&#39;t remember what flavor it was, but it was half red, half yellow. it was really good. (i drank 2 in one sitting)

i didn&#39;t care for the chocolate pastry stuff, but my friend thought it was good.

the downside:
placing your order can take forever
no bathrooms and no sink to wash your hands.
a little pricey (but it&#39;s fresh!)


did i mention great service?  on our last visit, my friend was feeling under the weather.  amir brought her a cup of hot tea, just to make her feel better!

Tasted as gross as it looked. The flavors of the chocolate tres leche cake were all there, but it was evident mine had been sitting around for a while. It was mush. The topping was smeared and no longer had any texture; the center of the cake was watery, and not in a tres-leche-cake-kind-of-way.

The short rib burrito was awesome. Great bold flavors in every bite. None of those weak bites where you only get the tortilla. Tried the spicy pork and it was super juicy and tender.

However, this time I remembered to take pics.  My experience the second time around was just as good as the first.

I ordered two short rib tacos and one spicy pork taco.  The event was hosted, but I think the tacos are about $2.29 regularly.  The staff was super nice, the order came out quickly, and the tacos were excellent.

The meat was nicely seasoned, the tortillas soft and the price was very reasonable.  In addition, the kimchee added nice crunch vs the normal cabbage.  I would put these tacos up against the best that LA has to offer.

I&#39;m happy for the success of Roy Choi (BTW, he is an OC guy, having grown up in Yorba Linda).  He has a real restaurants Pot in the Line Hotel &amp; Chego in Chinatown (I believe he is also involved in Pot Lobby Bar &amp; Pot Cafe in the hotel).

I&#39;d like to start with the little things: like the fact that their tortillas are slightly fried and that they are not stingy with the protein in their tacos. These details make such a huge difference!

I ordered the Short Rib and Calamari tacos. My friend had the Blackjack Quesadilla, so I got to try that as well. I loved all three, but my favorite hands down was the calamari taco. The combination of flavors in the seasoning was absolute perfection.

We recently discovered that the Kogi truck parks near our office in El Segundo on Fridays. I am excited to try the Spicy Pork Taco and Kimchi Quesadilla next week. And, of course, I will definitely have another calamari taco...My mouth is salivating just writing about this!"

I recently went to Kogi&#39;s Saturday 12-4pm stop at The Brig in Abbot Kinney (Venice), the same location where the truck first parked when it started circa 2008. I had heard stories over the years of people waiting 90+ minutes for Kogi&#39;s Korean-Mexican fusion tacos but lucky for us that the waits are much shorter now. There is now a fleet of five trucks to satisfy diners all over LA county and even Orange County and the Kogi buzz has worn off as all sorts of food trucks have flooded the mobile lunch and dinner scene in the past few years.

There was a steady crowd but I waited probably 10-15 minutes total with standing in line and getting my food which came up hot and fast. I ordered one of their combos which saves you maybe a buck over their already low prices. 

I got the $8 combo which came with any regular $6 item (I chose the pair of short rib sliders) plus a spicy pork taco (all tacos are normally $2.29 each) and a soda can. They were a bit small and tasted sour from the housemade kimchee with not a ton of meat. Still, I would return because I enjoyed the marinades of the meat -- I just want a larger portion of it, so I would probably try the $6 burrito next time. That thing appears to be the best value on the menu because it is massively Chipotle-sized, and hopefully filled with meat. 

The short rib, easily their best selling meat, can be had in taco, burrito or Hawaiian roll slider form. The short rib sliders were once a special of the day, but they were such a hit that Kogi put them on the regular menu. The sliders had shredded cheese and mayo -- I would much prefer to get it plain with just the meat and kimchee next time so it&#39;s not as sloppy and the meat gets to stand alone.

In addition to tacos, burritos and sliders, they have random specials (such as a pizza quesadilla when I visited) and funky desserts like Sriracha tres leches.

So many food trucks are overpriced (over $10) for long waits and small portions, but I&#39;m glad Kogi&#39;s price point is just right.

TIP: The Kogi stop at The Brig shares space with a valet parking lot, so you can valet your car and then get food at the food truck. #OnlyinLA"

Went here on a Sunday afternoon for late lunch and there was no line, service was great and fast and food was GREAT. 3 tacos + 1 drink for 8 or 9 dollars so pretty decent price as well!! 

My favorites were spicy pork tacos. I personally liked these more than short rib taco because they had more flavor with a perfect amount of spiciness since it was perfectly marinated! All the meat were delicious though. 

I wasn&#39;t too impressed by kimchi (= Korean style fermented cabbage) quesadilla- the kimchi taste was way too strong for me (and as a Korean, I absolutely love kimchi usually) and lacked other flavors that I expected! I would have liked it more if there were some meat, or anything other than kimchi in addition to kimchi. 

I don&#39;t know if it is just me but I was still a little hungry after the three tacos so maybe a slightly small portion compared to what I&#39;m used to as well!

We got there at around noon on a tuesday, the line was still pretty short about 5 people but by 12.30 the line really grew to about 15-20 people, there were a lot of offices around the area for the lunch rush.

We got two combos #2 that is: Any $6 item + 1 taco + 1 drink = $9

For the $6 items : we got the Kimchi Quesadilla - which was amazing and a good portion size - it gets more and more spicy with each bite. The tortilla edges were nice and crispy and smothered with spicy sauce. Be warned though it is very very messy and your hands gets very oily. We also got the Kogi Sliders which came in 2 in a plate with short ribs bits, lettuce, cheese and their mixed lettuce. Solid and expected yumminess, but I feel like the quesadilla was more filling.

I also got the short rib taco, felt like the same meat as the sliders, came with double tortillas the way I like it, only thing I didn&#39;t like was the lettuce felt a little limp mixed with their sauce. 

We brought our food to the park across the truck and ate it on a bench. I didn&#39;t know how much I&#39;d miss it until a few days later when I was craving for more. It&#39;s one of the OG of Korean fusion and food trucks so you have to get it at least once!"

Since I&#39;m a lame eater, I found the tacos a little too spicy for me, but I don&#39;t dock them for that; I&#39;m just too mild whereas they appeal to a broader spectrum who can handle this better than I. I think it was due to the ginger-soy marinade that they&#39;re prepared with. It probably doesn&#39;t help that I&#39;m also not particularly a fan of Korean BBQ.

Also, I&#39;m such a side-bitch (translate this to a side-item fanatic, be it chips, fries, any kind of starch, etc.) that I think I was disappointed there was nothing for me to align this meal with.

However, I&#39;m glad I had the opportunity to try this place. I probably wouldn&#39;t pay for another meal here, but if they were on-site for work, I would simply bring my own chips next time and settle for one taco."

Cheap, fast and delicious food available when you need it.  The Kogi BBQ truck has been my go-to late night drunk food kryptonite after strolling out of the bars in Venice.  

Maybe I just got lucky, but I didn&#39;t have to wait in a long line and I probably spent less than $5 total for my late night snack.  And it was fresh and delicious.  

Perhaps sober, I may have a different opinion.  Not sure.

If you have the right attitude and realize how overpriced and crappy most other food trucks are in the rest of the country, you may really appreciate the Kogi truck.  

Not too picky. Just saying."

The truck opens at 10pm. We arrived at the truck at 10:05 pm. There was already a line going all the way to the other truck.  I would really suggest getting there earlier than they open, like at 9:30.  What happened with us was that the line was moving extremely slow.  Why? Because these kids would be in front of us in line and then more of their friends would keep coming in later and cutting the entire line.  Try to be one of the first people there to avoid getting cut in line.  

Once we ordered, though, we got our food pretty fast.  We ordered at 10:45, and we got our food at 10:50.  I got the #3 combo (one $8 item, one taco, and one drink for $11) with the blackjack quesadilla and a short rib taco, and my boyfriend got the #2 (one $6 item, one taco, and one drink for $9) with the short rib burrito and a spicy pork taco.  

The short rib taco was decent.  It just tastes like beef with kimchi.  I don&#39;t think it was really anything special.  I liked the spicy pork taco more.  It has more of a sweetness to it and it&#39;s not as dry.  It also has a hint of spiciness so that it&#39;s not very overpowering.  I would rather have the short rib taco than the short rib burrito, because in the burrito it was stuffed with more cheese.  I think in the taco there&#39;s a good ratio of tortilla, meat, cheese, and kimchi, but in the burrito it&#39;s just so much of the inside that it kinda unbalances it a little.  I don&#39;t know but for some reason I would just prefer to have multiple short rib tacos than one big burrito.  The blackjack quesadilla was probably my favorite out of the items we got.  It has spicy pork inside and it&#39;s topped off with their green sauce.  The green sauce paired with the spicy pork is what makes it even better.  It&#39;s just that combination of flavors that I&#39;ve never had before and it&#39;s amazing.  It&#39;s extremely greasy though, but I guess that&#39;s what makes it more delicious.  

Service is quick and they put out all the things that you need outside, such as utensils, aluminum foil, and napkins.  You do have to ask them for sauce though.  I would definitely come back here, and now I know it&#39;s for the spicy pork."

I&#39;ve had Kogi tacos before, but whenever I have visitors in town I feel the need to take them to have one because it&#39;s SO LA!!!

We came here on a Tuesday night around 8:30 and there were about 10-12 people in line ahead of us. It doesn&#39;t take too long to get to the front of the line but it does take a little time to get your food.

We had the short rib tacos and the blackjack quesadilla. They are both delicious. The tacos can get a little greasey sometimes so I wouldn&#39;t eat more than 2 at a time but that&#39;s just me. The quesadilla has a little bit of a kick (not really spicy) to it and is super yummy with the melted cheese and pork.

I&#39;ve also had the chilaquilas before and frankly that is too salty for my liking. 

Overall, it&#39;s really a great concept and executed well. I wouldn&#39;t wait too long for it though. It&#39;s tacos afterall but it&#39;s definitely worth trying and showing out of towners to."

We finally made it to the Roja truck on Sawtelle for the 1 hour it&#39;s there (10:00-11:00pm) on Thursdays. A very narrow window of time, but I&#39;m so glad we found it.

We tried the the &#34;wet burrito&#34; - a special that consisted of a pork burrito covered in their special mole sauce. Though the pork was pretty inconsistently cooked - fatty in some bites, tough in other bites - that mole made the dish! It was lightly sweet with a hint of kimchi. I could dip anything in that mole and enjoy it!

We also tried the Kogi sliders, just because they looked so darn good in the photos. The photos do it justice. The buns were buttery, crisped on the outside and fluffy on the inside. The filling was a perfect balance of spicy, savory, and ferment-y (hello kimchi!). The meat was okay - a little charred, but overall very well-balanced.

Prices were reasonable ($6 for 2 sliders, $7 wet burrito) as far as food trucks nowadays go, since they&#39;re all way overpriced. And gimmicky. And pretty poor quality. Kogi is none of these things - as one of the original food trucks, it definitely does the food truck/fusion movement proud!"

Every Saturday night Kogi brings its magic to this spot in Whittier.  My recommendations are the spicy pork burrito with extra cheese and the sliders.  You can&#39;t make a bad selection when you eat on this truck.  The only mistake you make is if you don&#39;t eat here or if you didn&#39;t order enough food.

If you get there right when it opens there is usually a long line.  Head there about 30 minutes after and you&#39;re usually good.  Beware of the guy in line ordering for 30 people while still receiving texts from people changing their orders.  It happens but just luck of the draw I suppose."

Not a big fan of the chicken taco, but the other two were great. The sliders were amazing and the perfect size. If you didn&#39;t know, the bread on the sliders is made at the same bakery that makes in n outs buns.

I tried the Koji sliders and the spicy pork wet burrito and overall both were perfectly well balanced and quite tasty, the sliders being a bit better.  The Asian-inspired sauces were the winning element, contributing spiciness, sweetness, and complexity to each bite, but those bold flavors were also not overpowering.  The lightly toasted slider buns were partly why the sliders were better than the wet burrito - varied texture is always more interesting for the palate.  Moreover, the short ribs were slightly better executed than the spicy pork.  While neither meat was particularly tender, I experienced more chunks of dry pork than beef.  Lastly, I would have liked to see a little more beef on the sliders, but whatever, clearly I still enjoyed the dish!"

Even in 2009, the hype may have been undeserved.

California is no stranger to fusion cuisine, which has long been a part of its culture. Kogi isn&#39;t quite Korean, nor is it quite Mexican either. Unfortunately, it&#39;s a mediocre in-between. The food is flavorful, but it&#39;s unbalanced. The tacos, the burritos, they taste... interesting. The short rib was dry, the cheese was unmelted in the burrito, which are incidentally filled with scrambled egg instead of rice. Weird. For the tacos, there&#39;s an overabundance of cheap toppings consisting of:
            -sesame-chili salsa roja
            -julienne romaine lettuce and cabbage tossed in Korean chili-soy vinaigrette
            -cilantro-green onion-lime relish
            -crushed sesame seeds
            -sea salt
This is probably to compensate for the fact that there&#39;s a scarcity of meat.

The price is fair, although tacos are on the pricier end at $2.29 a pop. For $9 plus tax you can get a taco, a burrito, and a drink.

Although Kogi launched Roy Choi to the forefront of LA&#39;s food scene, today it marks one his weaker ventures. There is so much better California fusion out there, and Kogi is no longer worth waiting in line for."

Food:
I ordered the spicy pork burrito and it was definitely tasty. The only problem I had with it is that it seemed as though they used too much fatty meat (but that&#39;s why it was so tasty... Mmmm). Compared to when they first came out, their burrito sizes seemed to have shrunk but it&#39;s definitely a satisfying size. 

Staff:
All the times that I&#39;ve gone here I&#39;ve had the same cashier (a dude with an accent I can&#39;t really pinpoint) and he seems like a super cool dude! The cooks seemed to always be different though but this time around they seemed okay.

Environment:
Parking is a little sketchy since the plaza closest to the truck doesn&#39;t allow kogi customers and the gas station that it&#39;s in front of doesn&#39;t have too much space. But it&#39;s a taco truck so I don&#39;t expect too much from it.

I ordered the kimchi quesadillas and the kogi sliders. I also tried the calamari taco.

Quesadillas: First of all, the primary flavor here is salt. There&#39;s a salty red sauce poured on top of really salty quesadillas. I tried the kimchi by itself and it wasn&#39;t really good. Good kimchi has a depth of savoriness, it&#39;s sour and fermented. This kimchi just tasted salty. The cheese didn&#39;t really taste like anything but a bit of milkiness. It smelled awesome but I was let down by the balance and flavor.

Kogi sliders: I think these were filled with bulgogi. These were pretty good, nice textural contrast, I could taste the beef, the cabbage slaw was good, the buns were fluffy. Not very substantial though


Calamari taco: I tried a bit of my friend&#39;s; I thought it was too sweet. I had a bite and what I remember tasting is corn tortilla, sweetness, and lime. I think the seafood was severely overpowered.

Worlds have passed, food trucks abound. One can practically procure korean taco at taco bell,  and one can&#39;t throw a rock without hitting a graphically wrapped fusion truck.

Well, to be honest with you, it was because every time I saw the truck, there was a line backed up around the corner. I hate lines. 

The other day I was walking down the street, and I saw the truck...with NO line. How could this be?! 

I rushed across the street and placed an order for three spare rib tacos, then waited. Less than 5 minutes later, a plate full of deliciousness was handed out the window. 

Let&#39;s start with the tortillas. Little round discs of heaven. There are two per taco, to give it some heft. They are nicely griddled/pan fried. 

Then the spare rib topping. So good. The spices and seasonings of everything blend together so perfectly.

I loved this so much that I came back the next day and ordered the spare rib sliders as well. They are equally delicious. I&#39;d recommend ordering two sliders and a taco...so good."

I arrived at the truck shortly after they had set up shop for the afternoon. There were about 10 parties ahead of me and a few people were waiting for their orders. When I approached the window I inquired about whether I could split the slider order to get a short rib slider and a spicy pork slider. the answer was no. So, I got the sliders and added on a spicy pork taco for good measure and I got a drink to round out the #2 combo. The price was great. $9 for two sliders, a taco and a drink? This is clearly one of the more affordable and appropriately priced food trucks.

My food appeared in the window less than 5 minutes after I ordered. But, none of it was hot. Perhaps the cold slaw cooled the meat down. The short rib was good but the flavors weren&#39;t bold enough. The additional toppings including the slaw, sesame mayo and salsa worked well together. The sprinkled, unmelted cheese on top appeared to be kind of an afterthought and although the bun was nice and soft, it fell apart from the weight of the meat and accouterments. The spicy pork wasn&#39;t spicy but the flavor was actually better than the short rib and the tortilla held up to the generous filling. 

After everything I&#39;d heard about this truck, I was really excited to try it. Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed that it didn&#39;t blow me away. But, it was still better than average. My favorite Korean bbq truck is still Korilla BBQ in NYC."

We first had it when my nephew brought it back after tracking the location and waiting In line with our son.  They brought the tacos home and they were as good but we tried again fresh and it was delicious.  

We used them for our cater event twice.  The first time was awesome.  The second time not as good as the first time.  The price also went up.  

The Korean bbq tacos was delicious. Yummy yum yum.  The quesadilla were popular but the most popular was the sliders.

This one is on the corner of 3rd and La Brea on Saturday nights from 10-11pm. I ordered 3 short ribs tacos and the blackjack quesadilla. I brought a friend with me for the first time and his mind was blown by how good everything tasted. I knew he would react that way because the taste of the food is impeccable. We actually didn&#39;t have lunch earlier today because I warned him about the heavy food load that we were getting for dinner. I frequent this taco truck every few months, so it is more of a treat each time because I don&#39;t go very often. The line was long, but it moves very fast, so don&#39;t be deterred by the long line when you drive by. It is hard to find parking, so I recommend that you briefly park at the Ralph&#39;s parking lot across the street."

I remembered my friends jumping in a long line just to try out their tacos by King Jr High (off of Fountain Blvd) years ago. 

Circa 2014...while attending my son&#39;s lesson at the Rose Bowl Aquatic Center in Pasadena, I noticed the smell and the truck parked right out front. After the swim lesson was done I was hungry (of course I was) and checked out the Kogi truck (Roja). We made it before they closed up for the day and I was able to try their short ribs and spicy pork tacos which were both tasty. I also ordered their special menu item: jalapeño, spinach and mushroom quesadilla which I thought was just okay. 

Overall I had a good experience. My son was even able to take a few bites of the short ribs and thought it was good (he&#39;s a picky eater). Keep to the regular tacos or burrito menu items and you&#39;ll be good. Thanks Kogi, another food truck checked off my list!"

Their food is simple, fusing Mexican and Asian flavors adding a bit of heat, a little acid, and a little fat into one little taco. 
Today, this concept is a bit more commonplace than it was back then, so I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to follow the truck around town to eat their food. But if it happens to be around to corner, I&#39;d definitely stop by."

I have no idea why I didn&#39;t try it sooner, but I feel like 5 years of the Kogi experience has been stripped away from me.

I was en route to my usual taco truck when I noticed Kogi.  My daughter lives on bean and cheese burritos, so if it weren&#39;t for our established Taco Tuesday pact, I would have completely missed it.  After ordering her burrito, I made a beeline and ran (yes, ran) for Kogi. The menu looked amazing. After so much pondering (should I get a short rib burrito or the pulled pork quesadilla?), I finally settled on Combination #1: one short rib taco, one chicken taco and one pork taco. All were topped with this super fresh, tangy coleslaw type deal. And let me tell you: that first bite just rendered me useless. I sat there with that bite in my mouth, just sucking the flavor over and over again until it turned to mush. 

I&#39;m glad I got there when I did because as I sat curbside savoring my tacos like a beast, the line grew. And grew and grew.  By the time I finished, the line was 20 people deep. It was no surprise. Because the way they cook their meat compliments that coleslaw perfectly.  And the price wasn&#39;t bad either. $8 for 3 tacos and a drink.

I got lucky in that I happened to run across the truck before the rush. I checked out the website and noticed they&#39;re scheduled in different locations on different days. I highly recommend looking them up and giving them a try. And if you happen to come across them, definitely make the stop.  Don&#39;t let kogi-less years haunt you like they&#39;ve haunted me!"

You are a chef and an Angelino and definitely know a key ingredient to chilaquiles is corn tortillas since they add texture and flavor. Toasted flour tortillas have no flavor and texture, and ask any Mexican, they will say that flour tortillas are for burritos.
I don&#39;t think that they serve their tacos on flour tortillas? That is the same thing with the chilaquiles. 
I will stick to the tacos."

Every time I&#39;d pass by it, I&#39;d either keep going because I was already full from having eaten something else earlier, it was too cold for me to be inclined to surrender the luxury of the car heater, and/or I would see the long-ass line of eager customers and immediately say &#34;F*** THAT!!!!&#34;.

Well, the fateful night *finally* came: I happened to drive by the truck minutes before they were closing up, and by then, there was pretty much no line at all. The weather was not excessively freezing, and since I had not eaten for hours, I finally had no excuse to *NOT* pull the car over and see what they had to offer my gullet.

I ordered a combo #1 (3 tacos + 1 drink), and selected 2 short rib tacos, 1 spicy pork taco, and a grape soda as my component options. And since I have a sweet tooth that is constantly demanding sacrifices in the name of its appeasement, I also bought a rocky road brownie. Total for everything came out to $11.99. Was the food worth stopping for? (Spoiler: Yes. Yes it was.)

Wow, just wow ... while they were not nearly as big as I had hoped for (there is an apparently an option for extra/double meat - seems like a good idea I will take 
advantage of during my next visit), they all tasted AMAZING - a wonderful explosion of meatiness and citrus flavor (among others I could not identify as readily) stroking my palate went down with every bite.

Even the tortillas were more flavorful than I have ever experienced from eating any other vendor&#39;s tacos. I am also happy to note the tacos were ready and served to me much more quickly than I had expected - I think I maybe had to wait 2-3 minutes from when I ordered to when I got my name called, tops.

My initial fears of excessive spiciness of the tacos were assuaged after the first bite. Even though I am unaccustomed to spicy foods, I felt the chili factor was EXTREMELY mild. Bottles of Sriracha are available on tap at the truck for those who want more fire.

The rocky road brownie was variously soft, creamy, and crunchy. It melts in your mouth and quickly turns into gooey goodness. I only ate half at the truck - the other half I saved to finish later at home with a complementary glass of milk, to further enhance the experience via gastronomic synergy.

I&#39;m not entirely convinced that the tacos are worth waiting for in the long-ass line, but if you happen to be hungry and see a short line at the truck when you drive by, I would say that you should definitely stop and sample what they have to offer."

No seriously that&#39;s the worst part about coming here is the hype. If I wasn&#39;t so excited to try this place then perhaps I would have enjoyed it more. Let&#39;s just say my expectations were higher than they could possible deliver. 
The wait- 
I went to the Kogi truck parked off Westwood Blvd during lunch and there was a moderate wait. It wasn&#39;t too crazy because all though there were plenty of ppl, the line was pretty fast. I would suggest getting there before 12:30 because it did seem to pick up. 

The food- 
I had the chicken burrito and the calamari taco. The calamari taco was by far the tastiest option out of the two I choose. The calamari itself is lightly charred instead of fried and it topped with a salsa naranja and onions and lime. It was a true delight being both tender and juicy. 
The burrito was ummmm weird. I got the chicken burrito which comes with hash browns, softly scrambled eggs, shredded cheddar and jack cheese, chopped onions and cilantro with a chiffonade romaine and cabbage lettuce tossed in Korean chili-soy vinaigrette. Although the flavor was really good, the texture was just off. Too many gushy, squishy components not enough crunch. The hash brown and egg were just filler creating more mush and the cheese wasn&#39;t even melted which again added to its odd texture.  Short Rib burrito would probably be a safer bet. 

Overall I wasn&#39;t thrilled about my experience here. I thought this was the less exclaimed Krazy BBQ truck where the burritos had rice and fries in it. This was just lack luster, expensive and textually frustrating."

Two days after I had Kogi for the first time, I watched the movie Chef (I love the movie!).

After all it is a &#39;Roach Coach&#39; right ?  NOPE . This is FAR from what shows up to my jobsites on a daily basis. Those typica trucks serve up a greasy , commissary faire of oil , grease and ptomaine.
     KOGI truck is exactly the opposite. The food is a cornucopia of flavors and textures. There is quite a bit of variety , and vegetarian options are available as well. The &#39;Lady&#39; had the Kimchi Quesadilla , which is her standard preference. I had a Blue Moon Mulita and a pair of sliders. All the food hit the spot perfectly with above average expectations. 
    Tres Leches cupcakes were in order for dessert. For $4 a pop are kinda pricey but definitely deliver!! As you have seen from other reviews , I&#39;ll drive to ChinaTown just to get one from Chego , because alot of the time the Kogi Trucks run out of them.

Secondly, the cheese wasn&#39;t melted or anything. It was grainy in each bite and it added negatively to the texture and taste of the burrito. Meh.

After about 10 minutes later, right when we were about to order, they taped a cardboard sign for &#34;Cash Only&#34;. So okay, we paid with cash. My friend was about to order the spicy pork burrito, but they were out of it. In the end he and I both ordered the short rib burrito. Another friend of mine also ordered the short rib taco. On top of her burrito.

The burrito is fine. Just fine. Sure, it&#39;s novel to have kimchi and sweet short ribs in my burrito, but the burrito itself wasnt bursting with fireworks. So 3 stars for novelty.

The taco was meh. Stick to the burrito y&#39;all!"

The first fusion food truck, paving the way for many imitators. We tried each of the meat tacos ($2.29 each). The spicy pork taco with a special blend of pork belly, butt and shoulder, massaged with a sweet and spicy gochujang marinade and dialed back with lusciously subtle heat. The short rib taco with double caramelized Korean barbecue short rib, a salsa roja made from Korean and Mexican chillies, cilantro-onion-lime relish and chili soy Kogi slaw. The chicken taco which is marinated in a light ginger-soy marinade before they hit the grill twice to caramelize the way all good chicken should be. All three were amazing! I think the spicy pork was the best of the three. The meat was tender, juicy, and marinated in god like spices. The chicken burrito ($6) was a pretty decent size, maybe a little small, but the flavor was anything but small, the flavor was ginormous! It was stuffed with chicken, hashbrowns, softly scrambled eggs, shredded cheddar and jack cheese, chopped onions, cilantro, chiffonade romaine and cabbage lettuce tossed in Korean chili-soy vinaigrette, a pinch of sea salt, a dash of sesame-chili salsa roja sauce and a sprinkle of toasted sesame seeds. The best part of our meal came in the form of their Blackjack Quesadilla ($8). It is loaded with caramelized onions and spicy pork married together with melting cheddar and jack cheeses. Each side of the massive flour tortilla is grilled until it gets crispy and tender, then ladled with a generous amount of citrus-jalapeño-roasted-garlic salsa verde. This thing was massive! They take credit cards. We would have been hapy paying more for the amazing food that we received. It was one of the best food trucks we have eaten at. This is a definite &#34;stop what you are doing, and go find this truck!!!&#34;. They have 4 trucks roaming the streets of La to better serve you!

We arrived shortly after the truck opened for business and there was a huge line. We decided to enjoy a flight of wine &amp; beers at barsha and wait to see if the line died down at all. No surprise, it never really got any shorter so we decide to take the plunge and finally get in line. They kept things moving pretty well, it ended up being about 20-25 minutes from when we stepped in line to when we had our food in hand. 

So many thing sounded good, it was tough to decide what to get! Since none of us had ever tried it before, and we really didn&#39;t want to get back in that huge line we decided to get a bunch of different things to share.  We ordered the kogi dog, the kimchi quesadillas, the Kogi sliders, chicken tacos, short rib tacos, spicy pork tacos and a calamari taco. Sadly they had no desserts that night, we really wanted to try the chocolate tres leches cake. 

My friend really wanted to try the kogi dog, I guess it&#39;s a very popular item on the menu but that was my least favorite thing we got. All the tacos aside from the calamari taco tasted pretty similar to me, all really good but if you wanted some variety you might want to try some other menu items in addition to the tacos. I really enjoyed the kimchi quesadillas, cheesy and spicy and delicious. My favorite, hands down were the kogi sliders. Once I had a bite of those, I didn&#39;t want any of the other items we had ordered. The sliders are so amazing! 2 come per order, I could probably eat 3 or 4 myself. I am definitely getting those again next time the truck comes around!"

I ordered the Short Ribs and Chicken tacos. Both were pretty good but not memorable. There isn&#39;t much Korean fusion to them and I probably would not have even guessed there is any Asian cuisine inspiration behind them.

Very affordable, but only a meal for a regular day. Nothing special."

I got both the beef and pork tacos. They were okay. The beef was a little burnt and dry, so I ended up eating that one without the taco wrap, haha. I also got the calamari taco bc the guy said it was popular among the customers. It was horrible... lol How is that one so popular?! The best thing I got was the dessert.

As for this particular location/stop of the Kogi truck, it&#39;s quite a long line all the time! Like damn, how many people can crowd onto this deserted lane at 10 pm?! They used to be in the Home Depot parking lot, but now they&#39;re just on the street."

So I was like &#34;what the heck.&#34; My taste buds were rooting &#34;Kogi Kogi!!&#34; So I gave in.

I forgot how tasty their food was. The spicy pork burrito was beyond amazing that my taste buds were dancing. The short rib burrito was also delicious but I liked the spicy pork the best though. The blackjack quesadilla is by far my favorite...so juicy and oooh so yummy. It is topped with this divine flavorful green sauce. Makes my mouth water every time.

Although, food was on the greasy side and may not be healthiest but it was so darn delicious I couldn&#39;t resist the temptation. This sure is not the best place to go if you are trying to watch your weight. I felt so guilty indulging this delectable food. Well I guess that&#39;s double time for me at the gym.

I started coming to the Kogi truck awhile back with a now-ex, and the fact that I&#39;m still willing to come out to eat here despite the bad memories testifies to just how good Kogi is. I&#39;ve always opted for their Pacman burger and their sliders, but their tacos are good. Make it a combo (add a drink and a taco to whatever entree you get) and it comes out to between $8-11 total for everything.

The flavors that Kogi places in their food are truly exquisite. There is a perfect blend of spiciness (hey, Sriracha!)--but not too spicy--just good enough for me to eat and I&#39;m a wuss--saltiness, and sweetness. Their portions are pretty friggin&#39; generous.

The lines can get pretty long and they&#39;re usually full of annoying high school kids, but it&#39;s worth the hassle of waiting and dealing to get your hands on Kogi.

Pez Cantina was doing a small booth at Brunch at the Races and served up the most yummy dirty Horchatas and breakfast tostadas with some awesome spicy salsas so we decided to check them out.  Definitely one we&#39;ll be coming back to.

+Nice large happy hour menu.  Lots of different food and drinks and even oysters.

+Fresh handmade tortillas.  This is their backbone for everything (Chilaquiles, tacos, toastadas, etc) and it&#39;s perfect.  The right amount of chewiness.  And the fact that they turn them into hot chips with your meal is perfection.

+Salsas.  Their salsas are quite spicy and taste like they have many different types of chilies and ingredients in it, making it taste a little more unique then your usual plain salsas.

+Drinks.  They had a ton of nice mixed drinks, beer, and wine on their happy hour menu.  The red sangria was one of my favorites (white sangria was a little too sweet)

+Ambiance.  The outside and inside area are both modern and beautiful.  I like how the outside patio has the nice bistro lights and you can look around DTLA.

+Service.  Impeccable even for happy hour."

But after we ordered (none of us 4 girls were very hungry &amp; we were eating around 3:30 as a snack, so we decided to share 1 plate and 2 happy hour items) we all felt a change in the service quality and assume it was because we didn&#39;t order as much as he expected. 

I&#39;m sad to be giving this place a low rating bc honestly the food was AMAZING.  It was pricey (average 20-30 per plate) but it was worth it.  Plating, decor, vibes were all good too so the service just killed the vibes and i personally don&#39;t think it&#39;s very professional to treat your customers like this.

I do want to say I understand something could&#39;ve happened, he could be going through personal stuff but little things like taking extra long to bring us our check and checking up on us once while he checked up on other tables 3-4 times just really disappointed me.  And it also wasn&#39;t like it was a busy time either!  There were maybe 3 other parties besides us. 

Parking: $7.50 with validation in the cbre building (under the restaurant)

Brunch details: prices reflect 2 1/2 hour time limit.

$40 - buffet, bottomless mimosas and draft beer

$50 - buffet, bottomless mimosas, draft beer and margaritas. 

I opted for the mimosa brunch sans margaritas, although I love their margaritas, and was pleasantly surprised by all the food options. Typical Mexican breakfast dishes like: chilaquiles, beans, eggs and pozole, alongside different meats, salads, grilled veggies and ceviches. There was also a dessert table with flans, tres leches, cookies and fruit. 

The service was good - they were very attentive with clearing plates and refilling beverages, and not just our waitress, but the entire service staff. 

Two points of disservice that I have to mention: 

1) I don&#39;t know who mans the shared bathroom in the building, but the whole time I was there (about three hours), there was never any soap in the men&#39;s room. This is VERY unhygienic considering the amount of men that are circulating the bathroom, including all the employees of the restaurant that I saw going in and out of there. 

2) Yes, the service was good, but nowhere did they mention that a service charge would be applied to our bill. We were only a party of 3 and were billed the 18% gratuity at the end when we received our bill. I&#39;ve said this many times - in regards to many restaurants - you CANNOT bill customers any extra fees or gratuities without prior knowledge. That is illegal! It was not mentioned to our upon arrival, not mentioned by the waitress and not displayed anywhere online. By doing this, I am left disappointed with a company (right now, this one) and if anything, they are short changing their staff on a possibly bigger tip.

The experience was bittersweet. A lot of good notes on the food and service, but the last two negative comments do affect my overall experience and the possibility to keep me as a repeat customer."

First id like to comment on how great their patio area is. Make reservations ahead of time and ask for it because you probably won&#39;t get seated there unless you do. 

Also try their speciality drinks. I had 3 types of margaritas, all of which were amazing. I think this place has the best restaurant cocktails in DTLA. 

Food wise we got a few ceviches and the molcajete. I highly recommend the molcajete as its a dish with bubbly broth and like 3 types of meat. You eat it with tortillas."

A big main dining room, a decent sized bar and outdoor patio and a private party room in the back. We were seated in a booth in the bar and lounge area, it was a little dark, but most bigger tables are for larger parties in the more open and brighter main dining room.

The menu is fairly big, it seems Mexican food focusing on seafood is a trend these days, and the reason I love Mexican food is because the seafood is awesome. Like many trendy Mexican places these days, no free chips and salsa, they have many different types of salsa, it&#39;s $2 for each additional salsa. 

Our food:
Complimentary hamachi ceviche for first time customers: very fresh and refreshing, loved it. 

Kumamoto oysters: hubby loves small oysters, I actually love medium sized ones. They were very fresh, the housemade salsa was so good, I kept it to eat with other food. 

Carne Asada tacos with side of veggies: tacos were so delicious, the meat was perfectly seasoned and so tender. I loved the veggies. 

Special of the night deep fried red snapper whole fish: this is my favorite Mexican dish next to fish tacos. It was a big fish, so flavorful and yummy, loved the crispy skin and tender fish meat. 

Drinks:
Hibiscus berry margarita, dessert cocktail, tequila flight and a Mexican beer. 

Cocktails were so tropical and beautiful, but they were so weak, I barely tasted any alcohol, but they were only $12-13 each, a bit cheaper though. Tequila flight was one of the best, the presentation was so lovely, we shared four kinds of tequila, they were SO tasty! 

We liked the food and service, prices were not bad for a restaurant in this area. Think I would skip cocktails next time cause they were basically sweet juices, not worth the empty calories. Just go for tequila flight! 

Now I know of a great place for tequila flight, would definitely be back for more! 

Ps. Parking at the underground building, don&#39;t get outside, the restaurant back entrance is on the right side of Peet&#39;s bakery. $7.5 with validation."

Unfortunately there was no manager on site at the time so we couldn&#39;t give a formal complaint. I wouldn&#39;t recommend this place to anyone that desires to be treated with respect.

It was a glorious afternoon; not too hot, not too cold. 

Service: the waiter stopped by our table took libation orders for two guests and walked away. Came back and took a few more orders and then went off to take care of another table. After waiting about 15 mins he came back and finally took all of or orders. Whew... I didn&#39;t think I was gonna eat tonight! 

It was Taco Tuesday so we couldn&#39;t pass up a great $2 taco deal! I&#39;ll have the fish taco &amp; al pastor, some guacamole for the table and we&#39;re set! The guac and chips came right out. 10-15 minutes later one by one, the tacos came out. After everyone was finished eating, 2 colleagues still did not receive their food so they ended up canceling their order which was disappointing. 

All in all, the food was meh, the service was blotchy.  I&#39;d probably try other places before deciding to come back here. Sorry guys!"

I got the taco plate &amp; it came with 2 tacos, rice &amp; beans &amp; it was $18. The chips &amp; salsa were delicious, but you do pay for it. It isn&#39;t just brought out like other Mexican restaurants. It was $3, but worth it because the seasoning on the chips was so yummy. The drinks were good too but they could go a little more heavy on the alcohol in the mixed drinks. 

The service was mediocre. My biggest peeve at restaurants is when there is food on your plate and a lot of it, the waiter comes and asks if they can take it and is already reaching for the plate. They did that plenty of times. We had a few drinks &amp; I wanted to munch on the food that we had ordered. So that got pretty annoying. 

Would I go back? Not for dinner. It wasn&#39;t worth the price. Maybe for their taco Tuesday&#39;s I definitely would.

I prefer going to a hole in the wall with you get the real Mexican food but what you will lack would be the service.  The staff here were attentive and did serve the food quick enough though we had a party of 20 ppl.

Tip:  Make sure to reservation for a large party ahead of time.   

Likes:
1.  The chips were house made and served warm with a nice crisp.   The house salsa was really flavorful.  The chipotle salsa as my favorite.

2. The house made guacamole was one of the best i have ever had.   I couldn&#39;t stop eating the chips with the guacamole.  

3.  I ordered the fried fish tacos and it nicely prepared with a good size of the fish.  Batter was light so you can taste the freshness of the fish.  It was a good portion to just order 2 tacos for lunch.

Dislikes:

1. Parking was difficult getting in and out of the garage and was pricey at $12 with validation.  I recommend finding street parking if possible."

But wow o wow - this food was phenomenal. All I had was guacamole and chips but this gourmet version really took me away. The margaritas are definitely some of the best I&#39;ve ever had. I&#39;m going back to try the whole menu. And it helped that the  waitress was super sweet.

Food was decent however, I&#39;m giving a 1 star rating because of the bus boy. We stayed a little after closing and he kept telling us &#34;are you guys done yet, everyone want to leave&#34; he said it in Spanish so I&#39;m assuming he didn&#39;t think we spoke Spanish. This person was so rude we are never going there again!!!"

The ambiance was really calm and romantic even while the live Latin group played salsa, cumbia, etc. The bistro lighting  and the Mexican picado banner decorated across the patio gave it a real Latin feel to it. The guacamole was so amazing (lemony). Shrimp  and cauliflower taquitos were delicious as well but I don&#39;t think it had that much shrimp. The rice was so delicious I couldn&#39;t complain about the $5 charge, but the beans were not worth $5. Cocktails were amazing, everyone enjoyed their cocktails. I just wish there was more liquid than ice in my cup. If you are coming with a large group, the bill will not be split and they only allow up to 7 credit cards to pay bill. Let&#39;s just say we were there for about 1hr trying to figure it out. Lol You would think it would be easy for everyone if the bill was split and I think it would allow new parties to be seated quicker and that would make more money. It would just keep it pushing. My experience was overall great. I would definitely come back but just with 1 person"

$2 tacos all day is a no brainer. Sit on the patio in the afternoon for a relaxed, shady spot in the financial district."

The salsas and food were definitely tasty.  I wasn&#39;t a fan of the chicken tinga (looked more flavorful that it actually was) and the shrimp and fish were heavily battered.  BUUUUTTTT the carne asada!!!!!!!! fantistico! The carnitas magnifique!!! They were busy on this particular night so I wasn&#39;t impressed with the service.  The menu looks delish and I definitely want to try more.  I see this place being packed for happy hour hours but after 8:30 I don&#39;t see it being crowded.

Pretty central in the Bunker Hill section of DTLA, the restaurant is very neat and clean, a nice ambiance. We had reservations so I don&#39;t know how long the wait time is without.  Service was impeccable, we never sat with an empty glass for too long, everyone was very attentive.  I think our waiter&#39;s name was John, he was our MVP.  Why 4 stars instead of 5, considering the excellent brunch experience? I would have preferred more breakfast foods in the buffet.  Im the type of brunch individual that wants breakfast, well I want breakfast all the time so there&#39;s also that.  Verdict: I will be back regardless of the minimal breakfast foods."

Yucatán pork taquitos were amazing...perfect crunchiness and the sauce was delish.  Queso fundido was a blast of different flavors...I was getting full and still couldn&#39;t stop eating it.  Ceviche tostada was very refreshing, loved that it had cucumbers in it, next time I will order two.  Ordered the Mexican Cesar too because it makes me feel good to eat a salad, good flavors but the other items were by far my favorites. Will need to come back to try other items and some of their signature cocktails because I only had a Michelada.  Only con was service was a little slow and it wasn&#39;t even packed."

Hole in the wall Mexican joints are pretty comparable to this place.  I would really advise the pushy server - wish I caught his name but didn&#39;t, to lay off on the upsell. I felt like every drink, appetizer, or entree that was ordered was followed by some upsell suggestion.  It got annoying.  Please stop."

Our waiter had an unwelcoming attitude and it felt like we were being rushed. However, I will say that the owners more than made up for it! They are a lovely couple and tried to ensure that every point of our meal was enjoyed. 

Unfortunately, the food just didn&#39;t cut it. As a table, we decided that the best thing we ordered was the chips and salsa. For the price and location, the food just didn&#39;t have the needed pizazz and memorability to vouch for a revisit."

I absent-mindedly said yes to chips and salsa, as you do at most Mexican restaurants, but when I looked at the menu, I saw them listed with a price. HA!

The chips were super oily and not great, but we ate them because we paid for them. We didn&#39;t order guac, but someone brought it straight from kitchen to our table. When we told the waiter, he took it off the bill since it was a mistake.

Waiter made a mistake with my friend&#39;s order - when asked if she wanted rice and beans, she said no. Her tacos came and there were the rice and beans! Waiter apologized and said again, they wouldn&#39;t charge for it. That clued us in that rice and beans don&#39;t come with your meal and are an extra charge. Eep.

I had ceviche which was fresh and tasty. The caesar salad was really good, but too salty. I could&#39;ve had that as my main meal, but I wanted to try more - hence the ceviche.

They were out of horchata for this one cocktail (red flag #3) so my friend made a drink up to fit what she was feeling.

I liked the atmosphere of the restaurant closer to the outside patio. The bar area is a bit awkward.

Live music was sweet."

Drinks: Mango Chile Margarita, the Hibiscus drink, and the Classico Margarita. I didn&#39;t like my mango drink Bc I couldn&#39;t taste anything. The best drink was definitely the hibiscus one. That was a great drink.

Food: We ordered the al pastor and chicken tinga tacos, and chips with guacamole and salsa. The tacos were literally two tacos for $7. And they were just regular tacos. Nothing special to say about them. The guacamole and the chips were DELICIOUS, for me at least. My friends thought the chips were too salty but I thought they were good. For sure try the guac ($9) ! 

Service: Our server was super nice and brought us 5 salsas on the house. All were very unique and different so I recommend asking your servers what he or she recommends. 

Seating: We sat in the outdoor patio area which was really nice. You can see the nearby buildings and there was a live band playing music and taking requests. Inside felt too small and crowded so I recommend patio seating. 

Overall, we were Super excited to finally get to eat here. But honestly, it&#39;s not the best Mexican food and they are not generous with the food portions. It is unfortunate but Also my opinion. Maybe the buffet is better not sure."

The co-workers and I frequent this spot on sunny summer days for a delicious array of fresh seafood with a nice Mexican twist to all the dishes. It&#39;s as if your abulita&#39;s classic home cooking underwent a make-over for Los Angeles&#39; classy Bunker Hill crowd. The dishes taste authentic and are presented well. The portions are perfect for a light lunch. 

Being seated is a breeze and the servers have always been extremely polite. I enjoy the fact that the manager comes around the tables to ensure you are having a pleasant experience. You are greeted upon arrival, checked up on, and acknowledged when you leave.

I frequent the spicy helping of aguachile which is mucho caliente. The co-workers usually like the lunch taco combinations(vegetarian included). I&#39;ve also had the ceviche which was delicious and seasoned to a perfect balance. The dishes are moderately spicy so please notify your server when you order if you need something mild. A lunch combo here will usually run you about $14, which is considerably fair for the ambiance and food presentation near Bunker.

Tips: The lunch hour can get very packed in the summer as they have a very nice outdoor seating area."

I&#39;m thankful for them for always inviting me to all the good places in LA and we always have the best time with great company and good food! My friends and I love food, no doubt about that.  But we also like a restaurant that can accommodate a big group. But on this very day, we were disappointed when food didn&#39;t come out right and food not come out at all, and the wait for our food was a little too painfully long but luckily we had each other and the tortilla chips and dips to entertain us. 

The food was good with an exception of my steak which was to be cooked medium and it came to be bloody red raw and under seasoned. 

Our waiter provided very attentive service with the exception of a few kitchen errors that made our experience a bit downfall, but that&#39;s not his fault. He did try his best.  My friend didn&#39;t get her chicken. We were almost done with our meal and still no chicken, when we were done with our meal, the chicken was arriving. Lol.  I ordered the New York Steak Medium, but it came out bloody red, raw! I only cut around the corners and a few pieces that is a bit cook through the edges.
Another friend&#39;s order came out wrong, it took a while until they brought out her correct plate.

 we ordered the dishes below and I got to try a few of them. 

 The GUACAMOLE, CHILE LIME CHIPS, AND POBLANO CREMA (Avocado sour cream) YUM!! So addicting and the very best chips I&#39;ve ever had! 

 Yucatan Pork Taquitos ($11)- It was delicious and the meat was not dry.

Pozole Verde ($9). Soup (I didn&#39;t get to try this, but my friend said it was good)

Chimichurri grilled half chicken ($19) - The chicken was very tender.

Braised Lamb Shank, ($23)- Didn&#39;t try this dish. There were 2 scrawny lambs and didn&#39;t seem it would be filling. 

 Grilled New York Steak with bacon chipotle marmalade, garlic mac &amp; cheese, spinach, and onion rings. ($24)- I ordered the steak Medium but it came bloody raw! I wan&#39;t too thrill over the bacon chipotle marmalade. 

 2 tacos with lime rice and beans ($17). Lime rice was good.

 French fries with chili powder, lime, and chives ($7)- This was good. The ingredients made the fries super Yummy!

 Corn Esquites- with chile butter, lime and parmesan cheese ($7)- The corn was very good! I love the cheese and lime that made the corn very good.

 Caramelized Plantains with crema and queso fresco ($7) 

I did not order any drinks but got a sip of my friend&#39;s Hibiscus Bry alcoholic drink. It was really good, fruity and strong. The Pez Poloma looks really good too . Such great presentation on the cocktails.

 Parking is in the Mellon Bank parking structure located on Grand Ave. (It&#39;s easily missed, so slow down as you get up the hilltop on Grand) Parking was $12 with validation. Other than this option, street parking would be possible if you CAN AND WILLING to walk a few blocks going up the hill on Grand. Usually restaurants in Downtown have valet for about that price or less.  Pez Cantina does not have Valet parking option and parking for $12 is expensive.

If you park in the structure, you will take the elevator up to the main lobby of the building greeted by security guard. He will direct you to the left and enter through a small door through the back entrance of the restaurant.

 This restaurant has potentials, and I would like to come back to try other dishes and more of that house made CHILE LIME CHIPS, AND POBLANO CREMA! 

 Overall...

Food= 3.5 stars

Service = 2.5 stars"

Thanks to Sofia V. who gathered up the crew of 12 Yelpers for a UYE at Pez Cantina, we were all able to try this place.  
The restaurant  inside is modern and has a great vibe. We were seated a long table to accommodate the party. 

Cocktails here look very good. I tried the Pez Paloma consisting of tequila blanco, grapefruit, tamarind, agave, and smoked chili arbol. Pretty solid and strong drink. If you like spicy, sweet, sour at the same time, you&#39;ll like this drink. The other drinks on the table looked pretty good too. 

The food here is definitely very good. House made chips served warm have a chili lime flavor. The delicious house made guacamole is one of the best I&#39;ve had and highly addicting.  Salsas here are good. The table ordered a few different ones. Habanero mustard salsa was good. Not too spicy for me but chokingly spicy for a few. The sides here are good from beans and rice, corn esquites which had ancho chile butter, lime and parmesan. As an appetizer, we shared the shrimp aguachile which had cucumber, serrano, avocado, green apple, cress and salsa verde fresca. Very refreshing with a great tang to this dish. My main dish was the grilled New York, bacon chipotle marinade, roasted garlic cheesy mash, sautéed spinach, topped with cornmeal onion rings. Not sure why I was craving steak which I normally don&#39;t but this dish was pretty good and tasty. I also tried the chimichurri grilled chicken which was tasty as well. 

Service here was friendly except there were a lot of basic mistakes with the orders. With a large party, you figure the staff would make sure the complete party&#39;s orders aren&#39;t switched around or forgotten which is what happened. 

Parking here is $12 even with validation. Getting out fo the garage was cumbersome as car after car had difficulty paying with credit card at the automated exit. Secuirty wasn&#39;t helpful and a bit rude.

I&#39;d like to come back again to try other items on the menu. Aside from the so so service, the food was good, the company was great."

I tried the fish tacos. They were delicious. They put really big chunks of fish that is amazingly flaky. I also got the shrimp ceviche. I&#39;m not a big fan of ceviche but theirs was better than the one I had at La Tostaderia. The tostada was really fresh. And the shrimps perfectly zesty and spicy. The prices are a bit steep here but I&#39;m glad I checked it out.

Décor: While this place was annoyingly tough to get to from our hotel (it&#39;s at an odd spot that is by where the freeway lets off/on and there is also steep elevation, etc.) it is a really cool little spot with a very solid patio with outdoor tables. We opted to sit outside because it was a nice night (albeit a bit chilly) and had almost the whole patio to ourselves. Inside there was much more lively of a crowd and the décor is like a slightly more upscale Mexican restaurant. But outside is where you want to be.
Bathroom: clean and inviting, and well lit

Staff: Our waiter was very nice but he was non-existent. I had to get up and track him down on more than one occasion (new fork, because one was dropped, more chips/salsa, etc.), the final time being to ask for, and pay, the bill!

Food: We started with chips and salsa (outstanding chips, salsa... needs a VERY spicy one, the &#34;Salsa Diabla&#34; one they brought is weak sauce - literally) and then moved onto our main meal. The quesadilla was tasty and a decent size and I had the Molcajete and it was PHENOMINALLY GOOD! First off, it is HUGE and every single bite of it is beyond tasty. Wow, my mouth is watering just thinking about it! It seemed to have a little bit of everything and plenty of it.

Value: The prices are about what you&#39;d expect but the service level needs to come up A LOT.

We enjoyed this place and, if I were again in town, I&#39;ll remember it for next time."

Pez Cantina is like an upscale Mexican restaurant specializing in seafood. So don&#39;t come expecting cheap prices.  

Their cocktail list is pretty impressive! All the drinks sound delicious with a Mexican twist to it. The presentation is also fantastic. I got the El Burro which is a mixture of dark rum, lime juice, aguapanela, and Bundaberg ginger beer. It&#39;s similar to a moscow mule which is my usual go-to drink so I got this and I was not disappointed! It was well-balanced and even came with a sugar cane stick. Fun!

For starters, our group shared the Chilaquiles and 2 of the Queso Fundidos. I really liked the Chilaquiles w/ verde (green) sauce! The chicharron chips were delightfully crunchy in that light and slightly oily way. Tasted great with the queso fresco, cilantro, onions, and black beans! I wasn&#39;t as impressed with the Queso Fundido. It was very small for $10 and it&#39;s basically a cheese dip with lamb chorizo meat and it only came with a few tiny little tortillas. They also usually charge for extra tortillas. Meh I&#39;d pass on this.

For my entree, I got 3 Tacos ($4 each): the Daily Dive (yellowtail that day), Carne Asada, and Al Pastor. The yellowtail fish taco was my least favorite because it tasted way too fishy for my liking as if it wasn&#39;t fresh. I did enjoy the Al Pastor and Carne Asada though. I asked for some hot sauce on the side and it tasted much better after adding it! I gotta have that heat with my tacos! The tacos also came with some pickled vegetables on the side which I really liked. It added a refreshingly acidic balance to the heavier meaty tacos. Overall though, I&#39;d much rather have some King Taco or El Taurino tacos! :P

They gave us a free dessert with a candle for my friend&#39;s birthday which was a nice touch. :) 

Service: our waitress was really sweet and nice! However, the manager was a little cold. No smiles. :( Either she hates her job or she was having a bad day. I sure hope it was just the latter... 

Parking: first 2 hours free with validation in the parking garage."

We had a reservation for a party of 9. Our waiter was quick to come and get our drinks, suggested food and made everyone feel welcomed. I loved the Molcajete it was tasty, the meats were tendered with hand made tortillas. I also tried the shrimp cocktail and it was okay not a fan of a smokey flavored in the end. My dad had salmon which was delicious.

Cocktail drinks were pretty good too I had &#34;como la flor&#34; &#34;La Paloma&#34; 

The restaurant is nicely decorated, clean and it&#39;s in the heart of downtown with beautiful views and perfect for pics. 

Self Parking is $7.50 with validation. The entrance is on the right side just passing the restaurant. 

Music they had a live band playing salsa. 

I would definitely be going back in a warm night to enjoy the patio seating."

Happy to say that their service was vastly improved and everyone seemed to enjoy the food. My one remaining complaint about the happy hour is that it wasn&#39;t clear there was a charge for each order of chips and salsa (which are complimentary at most Mexican restaurants I&#39;ve been to) until the bill came. But the food was tasty and their margaritas are strong, so #win."

My family and I ordered a little bit of everything, at least that&#39;s what it seems like since we wanted to try it all. Shrimp cocktail was unique, flavorful and so fun to eat. Along with an amazing veggie salad with sorbet, we tried the lamb dish, steak plate, green pozole, and scallop tostada. We ended it with the delicious churros for dessert. 
Oh yes, and margaritas! Made to perfection. We had the berry flavored and classic margarita. 
Service was awesome, and we left pretty happy!

Meeting Mohib here for lunch was a great plan but the bigger challenge was actually locating this restaurant. Sure, I know where Bunker Hill is and the Wells Fargo Tower is located. Well, someone better place that pin on the map and describe to anyone that it is in the same building as Mellon Bank on the back side facing Grand Ave and not on Hope Street. That&#39;s what I would tell anyone I&#39;m meeting up with in the future. It was not Mo&#39;s fault as I did assume it was on Hope Street but that&#39;s what I get for assuming.

I think coming here in such an odd hour for lunch should allow the chef more than enough time to prepare the dish. So I&#39;m expecting a punch and explosion of flavor. We ordered chips and salsa which is called Chips and Guac with house salsa. It was a few salsas to try but I&#39;m sure glad I&#39;m sharing this appetizer at $9 for the order. If I was here by myself, it would be the only thing I order. In addition, I ordered the Shrimp and Octopus Coctel which I further sampled the house salsas right into the coctel glass. It is $10 for the small and $15 for the large. 

When we came here, it just opened. Actually it was the very first week. They were still training wait staff and bartenders. Where they seated us is a booth but it was one of those curved booth that should have seated one person. Picture this, a table or booth no matter how you sit as the table fits the booth but two grown ass men look (at least i felt) very uncomfortable. Then you try to fit two big ass plates with an order of chips and guac. The entire time it was both of us apologizing while we sit up proper in the booth. If you slouch, BANG, knee hits the table post or the other person&#39;s knee. I did hold off from posting this review since I knew it was brand spankin&#39; new and many things to work out for service. I thought I would be back for a second visit but have not brought myself in here. That&#39;s all I have to say about it for now until I get to come back and check it out again."

It&#39;s not until you get the bill that you realize that they are not complimentary and actually costed me $12. I was a bit upset about that, but not too much because it was actually really worth it. Their chips have a nice seasoning on them that taste great on their own. But they taste even better with the mountain of guacamole that they give you, which is also delicious. I was full just from the guac &amp; chips! The only thing is that I wish they had warned me that the chips &amp; guac were extra.

For my main meal, I ordered a shrimp taco &amp; a carne asada taco. Both were a fairly good size with lots of toppings, and quite delicious.

The stuff here is a bit pricey, but the price matches the good quality in food."

They have the best and most fresh homemade tortilla chips with amazing guacamole.
If you want a refill on chips it will take a few since they make them fresh!

The queso was also good with fresh corn tortilla.

I visited here with a few girlfriends during brunch.

Located on Grand this location and reviews felt sensible. &#34;Four solid stars&#34; we though, let&#39;s do it. 

*3 stars for mediocre service (one of my restaurant pet peeves is when server does not make eye contact). First impression, our server greeted us looking at his pad (After asking our server his name he finally made eye contact). We ordered margaritas which happened to come fast but after that everything slowed down. 
We ordered food and it came in a timely manner.  However, half way our meal we wanted to order another round. This is when it became a challenge to order. I had to wave down my server (which I hate!!). Finally, I was hoping that at least the food could enliven the first time experience. 
*3 stars for comme ci comme ca food. We ordered the potato taquitos, my friend and I agreed needed flavor. Luckily, the grilled octopus (which btw I may consider again) was VERY GOOD. Lastly, dessert was disappointing. We ordered the churros which looked like little turds in a martini glass were not good not bad. 

Will I come here again? Mmm, I like to give places benefit of doubt but I rather try another restaurant. :)"

We liked the place as soon as we got in and saw the decor, live music and tasty menu options. Everything went well as our waiter was very attentive initially when taking our orders. Unfortunately after receiving our food the service from the waiter went down. He no longer came around to check up on us or ask if we needed our drinks refilled. When it came time to pay he was nowhere to be found as we had parked in the parking lot underneath the restaurant that charges $7.50 for the first 3 hrs and after that 3 hrs you start getting charged more so we wanted to leave prior to the 3 hr limit. So we tried waving our hands in the air to get his attention but the guy kept looking away or avoided making eye contact with our group and would just walk by as if we didn&#39;t exist. After like 20-30 minutes of trying to get that guys attention we get the bill. Then that when we noticed that we were getting charged for chips and salsa that we had originally thought were complimentary as they were brought to the table prior to our food and no one have ordered them either. So naturally we thought they were free ass a lot of Hispanic restaurants do this. The waiter nor the staff advised us that they weren&#39;t free. So then we look at our bill and we see that they were charging us $18 for salsa and $27 for the chips, and on top of that they had put a 20% gratuity fee which was not mention to us by anyone. So although this place has some good food it lacks very key and essential business ethics. I personally would not recommend this place as you can get equal to better quality food at other places for the same price but without the gimmicks."

The $9 chips and guac were completely forgettable. The guac tasted like the pre-packaged stuff with preservatives you buy at, like, Ralph&#39;s. Their tortilla chips weren&#39;t bad, nicely fried and tossed with spices, but you couldn&#39;t really taste the spices so what&#39;s the point? The $6 Pez fries are also just ok, pretty average fries tossed with lime, chives, chile, and cotija cheese. I like cotija but the cheese is in such tiny pieces and it doesn&#39;t stay on the fries; it all falls off onto the plate. 

I ordered the $16 crispy duck salad with apples, jicama, and cashews but instead received the $12 arugula salad with no duck, dates, and wheatberries. I noticed two bites in that it was the wrong salad but it took most of the meal for them to make my duck salad and it definitely wasn&#39;t worth the wait! The arugula salad was actually a bit better, and a huge portion size. The duck was crispy but had practically no flavor except for oil. For $16?! Woof! 

I also got the $4 daily dive taco which was yellowtail the day I went. The fish wasn&#39;t crispy and I was not a fan of the salsa negra. I tried my coworker&#39;s chipotle chorizo refried beans and, no joke, they tasted like...lentils? And you couldn&#39;t taste a lick of chorizo!

Service was inconsistent, very attentive at first, refilling our water practically every time we drank any, to being MIA the second half of service and not getting any water at all for a half hour, having to flag down our bill in a hurry, etc.

I liked the ceramic fish chandelier thingy that everyone Instagrams. But I can&#39;t really say the same for the food.

Only 2 stars because not one thing I ate was legit good and because they messed up my order. I wouldn&#39;t come back."

For Lunch I found myself continuously munching on the Queso fundido with lamb chorizo verde, goat cheese, pepper jack, spinach, fire roasted chiles. So rich in flavor. The Chilled Mexican Seafood Cocktail was fresh and refreshing though I preferred the Grilled Octopus appetizer instead with cauliflower-olive salad and pomegranate walnut sauce.

The restaurant is beautiful and the atmosphere is inviting especially on Saturday nights when they have a live band playing Cumbias and Salsas in the patio which also has a great view of downtown.

I came in on a Saturday night they had the patio closed down for a private party, ouch! Wish I would have known that since I drove all the way from Santa Monica just for the live music they have on Saturday nights.

The servers seem overwhelmed, service is slow! Both times I&#39;ve been in.

The food is not authentic and although I didn&#39;t walk in expecting authentic food, I did expect good tasting food. We got a Molcajete and it tasted plain and was missing cheese. :( If you can&#39;t make a Molcajete correctly, don&#39;t put it on the menu.

I had a Black Board Eats discount code and wanted to try out a new restaurant. Pez Cantina intrigued me with its focus on seafood and Mexican coastal cuisine. 

We ordered the Pez Paloma (spicy tequila cocktail for $13) and a michelada as well as the chips and salsa ($3) to start. Note here: you get endless chips and salsa if you stick to one type of salsa; if you want more than one kind, you have to pay an additional $2. We stuck to to the peanut salsa but our server brought us the poblano to try on the house.

We ordered several appetizers and small dishes rather than entrees and sampled the grilled octopus, esquites, queso fundido, and watermelon salad. 

Chips &amp; salsa ($3)- the chips are very good; nicely fried, not too greasy, and just enough salt. The peanut salsa seems to be a type of salsa macha but was too oily and not spicy enough. The poblano that the server brought us, however, was delicious. I loved it. It was a thick consistency and spicier than the peanut one. 

Queso fundido ($10)- this was good but I have the feeling that in the realm of queso fundido, it was just average. Plus, it was supposed to have chorizo but I didn&#39;t taste or see any. Served nice and hot with corn tortillas. 

Watermelon salad ($11)- definitely pass on this. The ingredients (jicama, watermelon, queso fresco, avocado, coulis, with amaranth crackers) sounded really good and fresh, but the execution just wasn&#39;t there. The ingredients came stacked in two tiers, I suppose to enhance the aesthetic appeal, but the slices of watermelon were very large and overwhelmed everything else. There was only a tiny little slice of jicama in each stack. The dry amaranth crackers really should have been mixed with the rest of ingredients or incorporated in a better way precisely because they were so dry.

Grilled octopus ($14)- the octopus itself was the best part of the meal. It was perfectly cooked: very tender and not rubbery at all. Delicious! Unfortunately, the tomato sofrito it was served with was  way too sugary and also tasted like canned Rotel. If I had eaten it with the octopus, it would have ruined the flavor. 

Esquites ($6)- good, but it needed way more cheese and less sauce. Unlike the street corn dishes, this one was very soupy. It also could have been spicier. I prefer the actual street corn. 

The drinks were okay; there was too much ice in cocktail but it was pleasantly spicy. 

So for the price of these dishes and drinks, I&#39;d say Pez Cantina does not fare well. 

The service was extremely chaotic. We surmised that they were thrown off by a very large party seated outdoors, but still. It started when we arrived and asked whether there was seating outdoors near a heat lamp. Just checking that took so much time that I wished we had just sat indoors. 

We were then served by someone who was trying but seemed to have little actual serving experience. It seemed like they were short-staffed and perhaps he usually functioned as the host or in some other capacity. We weren&#39;t told the specials. He took our drink orders right away, without really giving us time to look over the menu, then returned to say that the cocktail I ordered was a different flavor. I was able to change my order and my fiance ordered something as well, along with the chips. 

Our ordering continued haphazardly throughout the night. The drinks were a long time coming. When they were brought, we ordered the queso fundido and then had no chance to order the remaining items.

A woman who might have been the manager stopped by our table several times to ask how we were doing, but she was kind of awkward in manner. In fact, she stopped by while we were waiting to order the equites, salad, and octopus and I told her we were debating between the salad and the pozole. Her reponse: &#34;they are both very special dishes.&#34; Clearly she knew nothing about the menu. As soon as the waiter appeared, she handed it off to him, never bothering to tell him about the two items we ordered before he arrived. He also had forgotten about the esquites as they brought the other two dishes and then we had to remind them of the corn. There were many apologies from various people throughout the night. The server was nice enough to comp our chips and salsa though. 

I&#39;m not sure how well this place will do; it seems to be popular among the tourist crowd. The food isn&#39;t good enough for me to want to return here, especially at the price point. Pre-discount, our meal was $70 and was definitely not worth that much."

That corn was freaking amazing, had to pry the bowl out of my friend&#39;s hands or she woulda drank the salty corn liquid. The fish tacos were great, the lightly crusted fish sat in a wonderful crema and was topped with perfectly pickled cabbage. The flavors were so well balanced. The brussel sprouts had a nice char to them and were complemented by the peach and almond all brought together with a hibiscus reduction. The shrimp and octopus coctele was yummy and refreshing as well, not too salty and a good amount of lime. The sides we got were huge, we expected that they would be smaller, so we ordered a bunch, but we had way too much food..which wasn&#39;t a problem for us because us girls can eat! The fries are nothing special, so I would skip those. I had a margarita fresca with mezcal and it was so good - the smokey mezcal balanced well with the sour mix and sweetness of pineapple.

The food was great here, however, the service left something to be wanted. Not sure if the waitress was new or just didn&#39;t care, but she was not helpful at all. There is validated parking in the building  (CBRE), 2 hours before 5pm and 3 hours after 5pm."

The ambiance is really nice and the service is great. They have a lot of interesting ans tasty dishes - but their home made chips are the real start here. Be careful because you WILL fill up on them before your meal. 
Happy hour is pretty good, but I think the prices could be a little better.
The drinks are REALLY good. Lots of fresh juices and the bartenders are meticulous with their craft.
They also have a really big outdoor seating area. Great for a company event or a group dinner."

It wasn&#39;t very busy the night of my visit so getting a table wasn&#39;t a problem at all. The ambiance was great and the music was pretty chill. I had checked online prior to my visit to see their specialty was seafood and Mexican cuisine in a more culinary form. This influenced my decision to pick here for the birthday occasion, plus my mom loves Mexican cuisine. 

Our server was excellent! Stayed on top of everything while also socializing with all who had attended in our party. Food and drinks were ordered, served in a timely manner and all were awesome! I had the beef cheek and potato taquitos. I&#39;d easily take the potato taquitos over the shrimp...they were delicious!!! Quite naturally, I tried everyone&#39;s food along with our appetizers. The crispy skin chicken was the best dish of the night. Crispy, moist and flavorful!!! I&#39;d most definitely come back for that chicken and the potato taquitos.

Our server knew it was my moms birthday and without asking, he brought a tres leches flan cake for her. Tres leches and flan together makes one hell of a dessert.

It was fairly new on my visit so that would explain it not being so busy, plus it was a Monday night. It can rack up in price depending on what you order but worth it if you&#39;re visiting on any occasion. Lots of great dishes!

Sure, I said, not knowing that it was on top of a pretty steep hill from where I&#39;d parked. After schlepping my way up it took me a little while to spot it at the base of a high-rise, and then after a final flight of stairs, I was in. Whew, it was quite a workout! I was early enough that I was able to snag some seats at the bar for me and my friends, which was a stroke of luck because this place got bizzay. I liked the decor and atmosphere of the place--kind of corporate but well put together because of that, I suppose (also a bit pricey due to said corporateness). Our bartender/server was super-nice even though he was sweating up a storm furiously mixing up a variety of cocktails for the whole joint. They have a pretty good selection on their happy hour menu and we availed ourselves to a good portion of it, as that was the most economical way to go. I got an order of their fish tacos, which were weirdly overbreaded but quite tasty, nonetheless. I tried their sangria and a paloma and found them to be well-made and delicious. All in all my friends and I had a good time here but unless somebody&#39;s getting more points or whatever I don&#39;t see a need to return.

STEPH JUDGEMENT: Good place for happy hour if you happen to work nearby."

On a recommendation from the plaza security guard, we roamed towards the lights of the outside patio here.

I was initially a bit disappointed--the patio and its romantic setting was closed for a private event. However, the bustle and dimness of the interior made for a pleasant ambience as well. I do love being around people though, so take that into account.

Most everything we had here was great. The chips and guacamole, while a bit pricey at $13, were well worth it. The chips were flaky with just the right amount of crisp and the guac had every element you expect in a good guac, while being more than enough for probably six people. People drooled as they went by. I ate way too much of it. The salsa negra had amazing flavor as well.

The pork taquitos were flaky, crispy, and tasty, and among the best I&#39;ve ever had. Equally great were the mini ceviche tostadas, which came compliments of the chef. Cute in their tinyness, and outstanding in taste, I could have had several more.

Each dish&#39; presentation was pleasant as well. There was obvious attention paid to the presentation of each dish, much more so than the average Mexican restaurant. This was also evident in the drink prep--the hibiscus berry margarita was pretty and a nice balance of sweetness and alcohol. They have a varied selection of beers as well.

One note, this is likely not the best place for vegetarians. My date was a bit disappointed with the pea and garbanzo fritters, which I believe is the lone veggie entree on the menu. I tried a bite and could see why. They were a bit strange, hard to describe--a grainy texture, and not exceptionally flavorful. However, I could have only the corn esquites as my entree if needed. Even stuffed at the end of the night, I wanted to finish every bite.

Overall this is a great place for a drink and some deep fried goodness. I will thank that guard next time I see him!"

We were seated immediately and had plans to enjoy a tasty brunch. One of my friends asked to see a menu and we were told &#34;Oh, you just go to the buffet and get the food.&#34; That would&#39;ve been fine had we known that was our ONLY option. No one told us. No one provided that information to us. Service: strike one.

When my friend found this out she asked if she could just get mimosas since she just ate (but that&#39;s another story). The server&#39;s response? &#34;So you only want to drink?!?&#34; with a cara de fuchi that was completely unnecessary. Service: strike two.

My other friend and I enjoyed the brunch buffet. The choices were tasty but not plentiful -- it was literally a bar/counter top. Most of what I tried was good but nothing spectacular. My favorites were the horchata french toast and those bite size taquitos they brought to our table. Those bottomless mimosas though? Solid. They were pretty much a glassful of champagne with a tiny splash of orange juice; but that&#39;s how I like my mimosas: heavy on the booze.

Sure, this place didn&#39;t strike out entirely, but it&#39;s service could use a boost. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be back another time; I think I&#39;ll have to see how their happy hour stacks up."

The food was really good. You must try the shrimp Cocktail. The chips and guacamole are freshly made to order. Chef Brat Thompson did not disappointed me. It is very clear that the menu is well thought out and delicious. I wanted to try everything on the menu. Although the Restaurent seemed poorly managed. The service was very slow.  It took us 30 mins to be seated, another 30 mins for our drinks to arrive at our table and another 20 for food.. Oh yes.... 10 mins for the waiter to get us our silverware after being asked twice. I would go back for the food and the mariachi band! But they really need to speed up the service."

I tried four of the tacos (fish, shrimp, carne asada and chicken tinga) ... none were bad, but in all honesty the taco truck down the street serves up better tacos at a fraction of the cost.

The regular margarita was actually pretty tasty, so if you&#39;re looking to drink I&#39;d suggest that.

I will say i did enjoy the guacamole flavor, though it was slightly chunkier than i typically like.

Overall not a horrible experience,  and I wouldn&#39;t be opposed to returning, but i wouldn&#39;t necessarily make a point of going out of my way to get there.

pez-cantina-los-angeles,Mohib Q.,I2zcNlcm2YO5FuCiZbqMCQ,"Los Angeles, CA",1,1,1,139,37,WZ0Vt84VU0YgHa2ei2ixLQ,2.0,2015-02-01,"Pez Cantina has a lot to offer, in a lovely and happening part of downtown Los Angeles. For many it&#39;ll serve as a great lunch spot, and for others a happy hour (Weekdays 4:30-7p.m.) alternative on Bunker Hill. Pez Cantina is brand spankin&#39; new, and as folks will tell you on the blogs it&#39;s been a long time coming.
 
Logistics and Location:
Located on Bunker Hill in the old Mellon Bank building, next to Specialty&#39;s, and across from Blue Cow at California Plaza, you can find this unique space offering a cool twist on seafood. While I have no idea what the parking situation is like, you can imagine this place is perfect for the lawyers and finance, but not so much the counter culture world. After all, isn&#39;t everybody on that hill getting tired of their &#34;limited&#34; walk-able options? First world problems, I know.
 
Walking towards Pez, you&#39;ll note the entrance to the left from the outside and from the lobby. The host is towards the outside entrance. You&#39;ll the space is a very odd one, that Pez had made the best use of, while adding a meeting space and booths between the bar. Elevated booth spaces are a bit tight, but they offer the best people watching experience you can probably ask for. On the other hand, you can sit at the booths near the kitchen, where you can watch chefs make something out of nothing. Either way, the sound carries and it will be loud throughout the place. 
 
The food:
Crispy duck salad (lunch) with endive, jicama, green apple, cress, cashews, crispy shallots covered with a cilantro-lime dressing. Oh yeah, here&#39;s the part that I enjoyed. Delivered in an odd bowl, the mid-small size salad is filled all kinds of goodies. With the first few bites I noted that it should be mixed a bit, and then I went for it. The apple overpowered the endive, as did some of the jicama. The nice crunch was a welcomed texture, but I knew something was missing. I found the cashews to be lodged toward the bottom too easily, as the chunks were rather large. The lime dressing was also in need of being evenly distributed. Overall, this salad is refreshing and healthy, even if you don&#39;t like all these ingredients. If you&#39;re tired of caesar or cobb salads, try this one out and you&#39;ll want more just as I did. 

Chips and salsas: 
Consider the guac and chips to be a rip off at $9. Combined with the rather watery salsas, I don&#39;t know what to be impressed with here. Salsa and chips come at a price of $3. Seriously, guys? C&#39;mon. I ordered these guys with an extra salsa, which came at an additional $2. In Internet speak-I am dissapoint.

They do have, on the other hand, some impressive salsas outside of the verde and rojas such as a dry chile-peanut, habanero mustard, and pineapple-serrano pico de gallo. They also have some casual fare to accompany these items with queso fundido, experimental coulis, wings, shrimp taquitos, and chilaquiles. Perhaps that counts as a meal? Sure, sure. 
 
Overall:
I don&#39;t find Pez to be very impressive, and for several reasons. 

The space is small, and not very friendly to a mingling crowd. It&#39;s L-shape nature makes it perfect for groups of 2-4 and nothing more. Not even their back table makes it look like a fun place for a group. And if know happy hours, people will go in groups only to be displeased with the set up. 

The price for what you get is absolute rip, in my opinion. As a consumer I want the food to stand out, followed by the prices to keep me coming back. It&#39;s an incentive-based world, isn&#39;t it? 

This place bets it all on hankering a middle-class crowd because of the decor, while serving fancy beach themed cantina food. It doesn&#39;t parallel with the classy nature of surrounding businesses, and will take most out of their conditioned environments, and oddly so when they&#39;re still in their work-modes. To me, it&#39;s like putting a TGIFridays next to The House of Dior. To me, it&#39;s an odd sensibility and creation to be so bold and create Pez in this location. Sadly it doesn&#39;t have the pants to match, that is, when it comes to their food and prices."

We ordered the pork taquitos, shrimp and chicharron diablo and the corn. While the presentation was nice, I thought all of the food was pretty bland. 

Pork taquitos - crisp but oily and the accompanying guac and salsa didn&#39;t enhance the flavor 

Shrimp and chicharron diablo - this dish was tiny pieces of shrimp. If I put them all together it was probably three whole shrimp and a whole lot of garbanzo beans and chicharron. Also not at all spicy. 

Corn - this was sitting in a pool of oily chile-lime juice. I had to strain my corn on my plate. This was ok but again not the amount of flavor I was expecting from the ingredient. 

I&#39;d come back for the happy hour drinks but would not recommend for food."

Had he told me originally that they were out of ice I would have had a beer instead of my $14 mango cocktail that was just ok. Ordered the guacamole and chips, was good and it was a generous portion. Had the octopus for dinner and it was good, but not amazing. Ambience is nice, ate in the patio. There was a live Cuban band and they were awesome, just wish the service was better."

To that end, what a great place for a drink. It is located in Bunker Hill and surrounded on all sides by high rises which adds a pleasant scene when nihht washes over the city. The outdoor patio view was nice and competitive with some of the rooftop bars in the city. In a city with many options for alcohol if you&#39;re looking for a Latin experience that doesn&#39;t feel like a tourist trap go here. The music is pleasant and atmosphere welcoming. Our server was attentive but not over bearing. 

The offerings seemed great and I&#39;ll be definitely coming back to try the food and more of the cocktails. The cocktails we had were La Adelita and Margarita Classica. You could tell there was alcohol but it wasn&#39;t overwhelming; there was a full cocktail experience. Both were delicious and the presentation was great. Very Instagram worthy.

They allowed us to get a drink tab on our own, before everyone else which was nice since it was going to be a big group and they don&#39;t split the check for big groups. 

We ordered the Mexican Caesar with chicken ($15) and the calamari $15 and pez fries ($6). They charge for the chips and salsa is $3 a piece. The food was okay, not really worth the high price. I liked the idea of a Caesar made with kale, but when it came out it was drenched in dressing (ask for light dressing or on the side if you order this). The calamari was small, even though it was listed under mariscos (seafood), I think it should have been listed under appetizers so you could know that the dish was small. The fries were very good, covered in lemon.

The reason all the stars are low is because of the service. When we first arrived water was being poured continually. By the time we left our water glasses had been empty for over 40 minutes. 

I know that all of the food was ordered at different times because my family came in waves (darn traffic) but my aunt&#39;s fish tacos didn&#39;t come out until 20 minutes after everyone else. It was very difficult to have someone get my grandma a diet coke, and I had to ask for ketchup 3 times before someone came. 

I know it&#39;s a newer restaurant, and maybe they haven&#39;t worked out all the kinks of a big party. I think this place is probably a really great lunch and happy hour spot because when we were here on the Saturday, they didn&#39;t have tacos on the menu, but they looked so good on the yelp photos."

Pez Cantina is a full service restaurant specializing in Mexican seafood.  Located in Bunker Hill, it caters to the corporate crowd. 

$4-5 per taco, plus $5 to add rice &amp; beans.  $10 for a small coctel (and it&#39;s tiny!), $15 for a large.  $9 for guacamole and chips, but it doesn&#39;t include salsa ...$3 extra for salsa.  Seriously?!  I can&#39;t stand when Mexican restaurants charge for salsa.  It&#39;s pricey, however you get what you pay for.  Aside from the inflated pricing, the food itself is very good and the seafood is high quality.  Shrimp is consistently fresh and thoroughly deveined.  Homemade tortillas, tasty salsas, excellent quality seafood, and great menu selection.  The aguachile, coctel w/ shrimp &amp; octopus, and fish tacos are my favorites.

Service has been very slow, but hopefully they&#39;ll work that out as the staff settles in.  Happy hour menu looks great so I&#39;ll update soon.  :)"

Made a reservation 10 minutes before on open table and were seated right on arrival. There was a live band going, but it was incredibly loud. We had to yell at each other to speak and the waiter had to yell to speak with us - it&#39;s not fun to be yelled at while at dinner. (-.5 star) They were playing great music though!
Food - The food came out at a reasonable pace. Shrimp aguachile ceviche was FIRE. And the oysters were incredibly fresh. My friend and I split the beef cheek entree. The beef cheek was so tender and delicious, but the taquitos on the plate were inedible. We also had the chips and guac, delicious. However, I have an issue with this. Upon sitting and not glancing over the menu, the waiter arrives and asks if we&#39;d like to start off with chips and guac or chips and salsa. 

As someone who frequents Mexican restaurants, these items are generally free to $5. So it was stunningly surprising to find that we would be charged after finding out that chips and salsas aren&#39;t cheap. I&#39;m not upset that it costs money to get these items, I&#39;m upset that the waiter just went for it and made it seem like he was just bringing it to the table. (-.5 star)

Finally, at the end of dinner, we couldn&#39;t get our waiter to come to our table so that we could get the check (had to ask the busboy). But we finished and headed out. Upon entering the men&#39;s restroom, I walked over to the stall only to find the toilet covered in vomit. ALL OVER. Like on the walls and seat and it was absolutely disgusting. When I went to tell the host/manager what I had seen so they could clean it up, he just rolled his eyes at me. (-1 star). 

To be honest, I would come back because the food is mostly delicious, the ambiance is fun, and I don&#39;t think people throw up on the toilet seats regularly."

The beef in the molcajete was tender and beautifully season. The broth complimented very nicely with a hint of smokey-tartness (if u add a squirt of lime). The cactus in particular was the cherry on top. 

The campechana was amazing. They serve it with either a smokey red sauce, which is like a more traditional cóctel, or with a salsa verde. I had the red sauce and it was beautiful. I will def get the large on my next visit.

For dessert, I had the tres leches flan with berries. I was not a huge fan. It was too sweet for my taste. Plus, I bake a killer tres leches cake and none ever compare.

Lastly, to compliment the amazing meal, try the tequila flight. The extra aged añejo is so smooth with a hint of sweetness from the barrel."

Luckily, I snagged a blackboard eats deal so we decided to check this place out at a discounted price. We came on a Monday evening around 7:30pm and the place was pretty empty. I wasn&#39;t surprised as this area is deserted at night. The restaurant itself is spacious with nice big tables for larger parties as well as smaller groups. The decor is pretty casual with large windows throughout so gives the space an open feel. 

We ordered a handful of dishes to share: 
--Shrimp taquitos were a rolled taco but looked more like deep fried mini tacos. They were fairly small, 3 per dish and was OK. The shrimp filling didn&#39;t wow me. 
--Queso fundido was a melted cheese dish eaten with chips. This was good but who doesn&#39;t like melted cheese with some meat thrown on top. Chorizo had a nice smokey taste to it. 
--Scallop tacos were disappointing. I wanted bigger, non-fried scallops. I clearly did not read the menu carefully but all their tacos are fried. 
--Shrimp coctel was delicious but not enough shrimp! It really is a cocktail as there is a lot of liquid left over. I wasn&#39;t sure if we were suppose to drink this... 
--Braised beef cheeks was the best thing we ate. Oh so tender and beautifully seasoned. 

After everything was eaten, we were debating if we would come again. The seafood honestly wasn&#39;t anything special to me. Maybe I missed some star dishes on the menu. Price point is a bit high but you are getting fresh seafood in a nice downtown restaurant. Service was polite and the dishes came out fairly well timed minus the last course (beef cheeks) which took awhile. We were given complimentary chips throughout the meal with various salsas. I&#39;m not sure if this usually happens but we got free chips! 

SO Why the 3 stars? We sat in a booth by the kitchen, and it has a large viewing window which I sat directly next to. Now, if you are going to showcase your kitchen PLEASE MAKE SURE IT IS CLEAN!!!! There were dirty dishes right up against the window where I was sitting. I just couldn&#39;t help but notice the clutter and mess inside! Maybe this distracted me from the overall experience but this was a definite no no for me.

Parking: Located on the same street as MOCA and Walt Disney Concert hall, Pez Catina is hard to miss. The signage is quite large and is on the west side of Grand St in between 4th and 5th. The parking here wasn&#39;t too difficult as there are plenty of meters around here. Apparently they offer free validated parking, but I just parked right outside on the street."

It&#39;s smack dab downtown LA and so good! 

Was invited for a late lunch meeting during a short visit to LA, which meant I had to forego stopping at some of my tried and true LA faves. I am beyond glad that I did!! 

The design is fabulous. It&#39;s a beautiful space with a great bar, high ceilings, spacious dining room, and has semi-private areas for special occasions and meetings. 

Their Margs are truly Bomb.com. Like you&#39;ll easily want 10 of them so make sure you have a safe ride home. 

We had a good spread of Guacamole, Salsas, Oysters, Tacos, Ceviche, and Salads. 

The Guac is a home run. Loaded with flavor and can be made as spicy as you like. The salsas were seriously Devine. They make a habanero mustard salsa that may just be a work out culinary art!! I will be craving the salsa forever. The chips are pure yummmmm fresh, crispy, salty, and totally Delish. 

It&#39;s LA so you expect the oysters to be great-- well these were amazing!! Fresh, tender, loaded with brine flavor and shucked to perfection. We had 2 dozen and wanted more! 

As the entrees and dishes started to roll in, I wanted to stand up and applaud. Each dish is plated with intention and the food jumps of the dish with flavor, style, and lots of yummyness. 

The corn tortillas are homemade, thick, and held up perfectly with each of the tacos we ordered. The Carnitas and Asada def stood out. 

The shrimp ceviche was really really good and didn&#39;t stand a chance with us...

The Ahi salad was huge, loaded with fresh perfectly cooked rare slices of Ahi dressed exactly how you want a salad to taste-- crisp, light, refreshing, and leaving you shoveling bite after bite. 

Our service was excellent. The sweet server was friendly, prompt, and very efficient with great suggestions and always shared a warm smile. 

We devoured the house made flan and we&#39;re kicking our lips from start to finish. 

Go and check out this wonderful addition to the LA food world. You&#39;ll be really glad you did!! 

Oh-- and BTW their prices are very very reasonable. I fear they will catch on and raise their prices, but until they do take advantage of the tremendous value in food, service, and experience. 

I&#39;m a huge fan and you will be too!"

It is my go to Korean restaurant when I just want something simple and homemade. It is a small mom and pop restaurant, so they don&#39;t do anything fancy with presentation, it is just like if your mom/dad cooked you a meal. 

They serve about 8-12 side dishes, depending on what they have that day or what is left that week. The side dishes change all the time, again depending on the season and what vegetable is in season. But you could just eat the side dishes with your rice and have a satisfied meal. I usually get the mackerel stew, squid stir-fry or pork stir-fry or the sujaebi. Everything is really good here!"

It was a little pricier than similar establishments in the area but we thought it was justified by their tasty, colourful spread of banchan. 

Banchan - we were initially a little upset by the fact that we were only given 8 while all tables who were dining before and after us were given 10. I even flagged down the server and asked. She seemed so confused and defensive - but after she realised that we noticed the number difference (not sure if it was intentional or not), she hurried over and grabbed the two missing banchan. 

Dolsot Bibimbap - came with very very very tiny scoop of meat but added bonus for the purple rice! Nothing outstanding but a classic done right. I was a little irked by the fact that the server took away the bottle of bibimbap sauce 5 mins into the dish being served. There were no other tables waiting and there were 3 other bottles available! She didn&#39;t ask if I was done. She simply snatched the bottle and walked away. 

Seafood soontofu - they don&#39;t ask for your preference of spice level. Whatever they serve as the standard was just right for my husband (his spice tolerance is pretty low). A lot of chunky tofu, moderate amount of seafood. He said taste wise was comparable to bcd&#39;s. 

Overall - A lot of miscommunication or lack of. Would consider returning if in the area."

I cook Korean food and I&#39;ve lived in NY and Korea - and this place is quite legit. I love banchan more than the main dish. I like going to restaurants that have a wide variety as well as simply good banchans - maybe this is why I don&#39;t like going to sullungtang places - they only give you kkakdoogee. Anyway, this place never fails me - their banchans are GREAT! and very generous. They are fresh and they taste home-made. Not too salty with lots of flavors. 

We shared galbitang, soojaebi, and nengmyun. They are generous with their portions and their meats - the galbitang had so much meat! I did a take-out more recently and they gave us a lot of banchan. I will definitely come back for more of their &#39;home-style&#39; cookin."

All side dishes are very salty, pollack soup is salty, (pollack wasn&#39;t too stinky or bad tho, the fish was pretty good but just a small portion) bean curd soup is salty with lots of kimchi and fatty pork belly meat, Atka mackerel was only thing I liked. It wasn&#39;t too salty but fried pretty well so inside was quite juicy. 

Prices are pretty expensive for what you get in quality and portion wise. Small restaurant, cozy ambience, friendly service and restroom is pretty clean.

They give you too many banchans but since everything is salty, there&#39;s not much to enjoy. I liked the candied mini potatoes and steamed cabbage. 

Vallet parking only in the tiny shopping plaza. I should have tried Yeop Ki Ttoppoki place in the same plaza!"

If the lot is full, street parking can be a challenge.

I grew up eating Korean food and can appreciate good panchan (side dishes).
I think I enjoy the panchan more.  From the lightly seasoned vegetables to the kim-chee, they give any meal a variety of flavors.
I&#39;ve tried a few things here but I think the cod is my favorite.
I&#39;m not exactly sure how it&#39;s made but it&#39;s cooked in a sweet, spicy, soy sauce marinade that lends a rich, deep, flavor of spices to the cod.  Even the big chunks of radishes soak up the complex soy sauce marinade.  There&#39;s not a great deal of cod in there but the flavor is worth the price for me.  I know fish isn&#39;t cheap so I can respect the price.  

If you don&#39;t speak Korean, in my experience, they have always been friendly to everyone.
Oh yeah, try the pickled radish, (Kkak doo gee) since that&#39;s what this place is named after.  It&#39;s good, as good as kkak do gee can get."

It&#39;s great for traditional Korean food, and it had a homey feel. I came with my parents, brother, and grandparents and we ordered about 5 dishes. It was so much more than enough food, probably enough for 7 people. We ordered the spicy pork and kimchi stir fry, the stone pot bibimbap, the spicy tofu seafood soup, the bulgolgi, and the handpulled noodle soup. 

The spicy pork and kimchi was yummy, but it was quite oily. The flavors were good, and they had pieces of dduk (rice cake) in it which gave it a nice texture to the dish! The bibimbap was a good comfort food, but nothing too special. The spicy tofu seafood soup was actually very well flavored, which I was surprised about. The bulgolgi was okay--nothing great here as well. The handpulled noodles were great, and perfectly chewy and a pretty &#34;clean&#34; dish overall. 
In addition, banchan was also pretty good with different sides that I haven&#39;t had before.

Service was okay, could be better, but not bad. The lady that served us took quite a while to bring us our banchan even though there were only two other tables at the restaurant. 

Overall, I&#39;d go with 3.5 stars because the food was pretty good but too bad I can&#39;t mark 3.5 stars!"

Funny enough, they don&#39;t have kkak doo gee as one of their side dishes :P
Just wanted to get a nice, Korean meal and ended up getting their spicy mackarel stew and kimchi and pork stirfry.
The kimchi pork dish had pieces of dduk in it!!!
We originally ordered the spicy cod? stew but she said that they ran out and they only make a small portion for each day. When it sells out, they&#39;re done and they don&#39;t make more because the best stews need to be marinated for a certain amount of time and they weren&#39;t going to run to the back and whip up something just to sell it.

A very unassuming restaurant, but Mapo has really good comfort food!

When you walk in, it&#39;s really small-- maybe 10 tables at most. Aesthetically it&#39;s nothing great-- just your average Korean restaurant with wooden floors, tables, chairs and plain walls. A lot of reviews said this place gets pretty crowded, but since we came on a Tuesday around 8PM there were only a few other people dining. For being a small place, they have quite a few options to choose from: tofu soup, stews, galbi, fried fish, bibimbap, cold noodles. We ordered based off Yelp reviews and it did not disappoint!

SPICY BEEF &amp; LEEK SOUP $10-something
Great flavor, not salty, and generous portion. I like that it was piping hot and not deathly spicy even though it looks kind of intense. I would probably like a little more meat in it to be nitpicky, but really enjoyed this soup. I can see this being perfect when you&#39;re sick because it really clears up your sinuses. Comes with rice, too!

SOUP WITH PULLED DOUGH MORSELS $9-something
Chewy, good-sized dough pieces with a clear, flavorful broth. This dish is so simple, but done so well. Generous portion as well. The boyfriend really liked this dish and he&#39;s not the biggest fan of Korean food!

This place is authentic home style Korean cooking at its finest.  Don&#39;t come expecting vague fusion menu items-- this is the stuff your grandparents ate and loved as children.  Because I&#39;m lame and not adventurous, I got the dolsot bibimbap, which was delicious.  But the real standout was the soo jeh bi.

I normally haven&#39;t liked soo jeh bi in the past, but that was because I&#39;d never been to Mapo. The soup had great flavor and the pieces of dough had been rolled so thinly, it was almost an elegant eating experience. It also paired perfectly with the restaurant&#39;s namesake, the kkak doo gee served as a side banchan.

The banchan offerings were delicious, especially the potatoes, cucumber kimchi, and pickled seaweed.  Service was prompt (probably because I was with three adults) and the number of guests showed that this place is obviously a popular lunchtime destination."

A woman came to take our order. My co worker ordered in Korean. Thank goodness he is Korean because the Chinese family behind us was having quite a difficult time ordering with another lady who could barely speak any English at all. Anyway, We got bulgogi and japchae. The woman was thoughtful and asked if we wanted the meat in the japchae mixed with the noodles, or separate. We opted for mixed in. Before our main entrees came, they gave us a huge variety of little appetizers to snack on and they were all delicious and well portioned! Perfectly spicy too.

Can get refills for side dishes. EunDaeGoo (Anoplopomatidae) Jorim (Reduction) with Korean radish is the bomb!!! I know. Why is this English word so long? Anyways it is cheaper here than the one in Chosun Galbi. It tastes just as delicious! 

Ahjuoomma, the servers, are kind of nonchalant but just ask what you need and they will give whatever you want. 

One caveat is that the door is kept open and the flies are bothersome. There is no ac and air filter so that is the solution I guess. 

The other dishes are good as well. Try it!!!"

I&#39;ve been wanting to try this place because they served their soojebi in a stone pot.

We ordered the soojebi and jaengban noodles.

The food was okay. I mean, it was good but nothing mind blowing.

The lady suggested this place and I was skeptical b/c I&#39;ve never heard of it, but she proved me wrong again. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food prepared by the ladies in this small and cozy spot in a complex that looks like every other one in Ktown. If you&#39;re looking for some authentic Korean food, this is the spot. Great for dinner or lunch, this restaurant is a little gem that always leaves me and my stomach fully satisfied. 

The soup with pulled dough morsels (Soo Jae Bi) and Hand cut noodles (Kal Gook Soo) are the best I&#39;ve had in LA. Fresh ingredients and all of the side items (ban chan) are great! That&#39;s a rarity around here. Usually, you have 1 or 2 side dishes that you coma back to, but I was having a field day with all of it. 

The Grilled Sole is surprisingly good too. Light fish that&#39;s salted and fried, not really grilled from what I saw. Grilled, Fried - same thing right?

It&#39;s best to valet park for $2 in the lot, unless you&#39;re like me and do a loop around the block just to realize that it was a futile attempt to find parking. I still think it&#39;s worth it. ;)"

There&#39;s a small parking lot in front of the restaurant, but we decided to park on the coin lot along 6th street. 

The restaurant itself is very small with two ladies waiting and cleaning tables. The menu is very simple with photos posted on the top wall and tabletop. 

We had the grilled sole (highly recommended) Korean BBQ ribs (plentiful) and soft tofu seafood soup (spicy, but good).

Don&#39;t believe the &#34;$&#34; on yelp. It must&#39;ve been posted years ago. Expect to pay at least 
$35-50/2 people for lunch. It was a bit steep and a bit shocking. Once again, we were famished, and we ordered from the top wall, that had no prices posted. It wasn&#39;t until we saw the tabletop menu when we realized how much our lunch was going to cost. 

Service is odd and uninviting. The two ladies are very mechanical and cold. Thank goodness the food was warm and flavorful."

Food: 
Dolsot Bibimbap (4/5) I would actually give this a 3.5/5 but I rounded up because this was one of the few restaurants that allowed this dish &#34;to go&#34;. They packaged it up nicely, so that it was still piping hot when I got home. This came with a sunny side up egg, different vegetables, purple rice, and Korean chili paste. There is no meat in this dish. Would have rated it higher if there was...

Kimchi Jjiggae (1/5) This had a bitter taste to it with mushy overcooked kimchi and the 3 overcooked rice cakes that were in it. There is no meat. This only comes with kimchi, a few soggy rice cakes, and a couple cubes of small tofu.

Banchan (side dishes) (4/5) Their kkak doo gee is absolutely DELICIOUS. It reminds me of Han Bat Sur Lung Tang kkak doo gee but better! Their other pickled items and banchans are good too.

The banchan were also excellent (very important!) especially their namesake kkak-doo-gee.

A cheapish meal, even from the main menu. They also have a small lunch menu, and they seem to do take-out orders. One note: they accept credit cards only on orders $10+.

We ordered the bulgogi beef and it was very flavorful and tasty. It came on a hot plate and it was sizzling when it came out from the kitchen! It was delicious and I would order it again. We also ordered the stir fried noodles. It was yummy as well. 

If you don&#39;t know what to order, they have pictures of dishes displayed on the wall and you can just point what you think looks delicious and you can tell the waitress that. Although they didn&#39;t have the price on the dishes, it was decently priced.

Service is quick and no added frills (which I like).

You&#39;ll get 8-10 banchan, most if not all made in-house, and well outside of what you&#39;ll normally get from even semi-upscale Korean spots.  The last visit had blistered shishito peppers as one of them!  They were beautifully grilled, and it was one of many &#34;freebies&#34; you get to accompany your food here.

Stay away the usual whiteboy Korean-American fare.... skip bulgolgi, etc.

Do go for the grilled mackeral pike, doenjang jjigae, yukgaejang, dolsot bibimbap, tteokguk, kimchi jjigae, soojaebi, etc.  The mama-san clearly runs the place with sincere and abiding affection, and while her English isn&#39;t the best, she&#39;s made my wife and me feel very welcome for the several years we&#39;ve frequented the place.

It&#39;s in a small strip-mall on the corner of 6th &amp; Normandie, but parking&#39;s pretty easily found around the block if need be, usually on 6th just west of Normandie.

Every visitor we get to Los Angeles gets taken here as example of the beautiful and rich cultural diversity this city has to offer, without any pretensions or &#34;style&#34; driven ethos.

It&#39;s inexpensive, unpretentious, and still off the hipster radar.  Koreatown no doubt has many little gems like Mapo Kkak Doo Gee.  Residents here get the pleasure of discovering each of them in turn.

Korean food is one of the under-discovered cuisines in America.  When I say Korean, I mean far more than just the usual smokey grilled bulgolgi or galbi joints like Soot Bull Jeep, or the upscale Park BBQ.

Ignore the crybabies who whine about &#39;bad service&#39;, or waitstaff with weak English.  Koreatown is still a living ethnic enclave that caters more to its &#34;local&#34; people in various stages of assimilation with the United States than elsewhere.  I don&#39;t know anyone who speaks Korean, though reading it is surprisingly easy given its radically rational writing system. I&#39;ve never once had trouble making my wishes or preferences known to the waitress - very often, the owner herself.

Vegans, you&#39;ll not find anything here to eat.  Kimchi and other fermented greens are initiated with a fish paste &#34;culture&#34;, and practically everything has some form of meat or meat derivative as a seasoning, if not a main ingredient.

Move along, move along."

It can really fill you up! My gf and I were literally the only people unable to converse in Korean at this restaurant, so maybe that is a sign that this place has real good food! 

Sadly, the $5.99 lunch specials do not run on weekends.  

Dumpling soup with rice cakes: It comes with 4 large juicy dumplings and a ton of rice cakes. It wasn&#39;t bad but wasn&#39;t the most delicious thing ever. Unless you really are into rice cakes, the dish gets a bit redundant if it is the only thing you are eating. 
 
Bibimbap: A good solid dish. The waitress, possibly thinking we never had Bibimbap before, told us that we have to mix in the rice. This was funny because we already knew to do that.

Food:
-Soo Jae Bi IS good, but not as good as the reviews make it out to be. I like that it comes out in a dolsot (stone pot) because it keeps the soup piping hot throughout your entire meal. 
-The stir-fried squid (oh jing bokkeum) is pretty good! I love that it has good amounts of dduk (rice cake) in it, which is different from the other ones I had. 
-Huge array of side dishes. All of them were good &amp; fresh! They offered refills on the side dishes before we scraped them clean. Awesome!
-Big servings! My co-worker and I usually have bigger than normal girl appetites, but we both couldn&#39;t finish our meal. 

Price:
-It ranges from $9-15 which is not the cheapest option during lunch time, but I&#39;ll definitely come back. 

Parking:
-I work nearby, so I didn&#39;t utilize the parking lot but it&#39;s small. It is shared with 3 other restaurants (and a few other stores that I am unsure if it&#39;s open or not. It wasn&#39;t during lunch time), so It will definitely be a pain during peak hours of dinner."

Since the menu on the table has no pictures, you just have to look on the far wall for pictures. Luckily, we beat the lunch crowd so we didn&#39;t have to wait too long. This place is known for their banchan (side dishes) according to my friend. She was so right. The banchan tasted fresh and had a good variety such as some broccoli, some white gelatinous stuff, kim chi, radishes, etc.

I ordered the mool naeng myun (cold noodle) since it was a hot summer&#39;s day. My friend ordered some dumpling soup. We shared both dishes and were both good. I consider this to be a good mom and pop korean restaurant. Parking is scarce as it is located in a small strip mall that does not have adequate parking. They have valet for a nominal fee or you can just park on the street."

What a terrible description for this little gem that serves up top notch home cooked food at unbeatable prices, with an unpretentious ambiance.  Unlike some of the restaurants on this list that only specialize in a few items, this place has a wide variety of choices, and they are all outstanding.

Mapo Kakk Doo Gee has a beautiful assortment of fresh and tasty banchan, that rotates frequently.  They serve a few types of crispy tender grilled fish, all sorts of spicy and non-spicy soups, noodles and chapchae, a delicious bibimbap, and dare I say, a fantastic bulgogi.  This is simply home cooking at its finest.

It&#39;s definitely a hole in the wall. I definitely would have passed right by it had my friend not taken me there to check it out. 

It was my first Bibimbap experience and WOW, it was fantastic! The ladies working there were very helpful because apparently I just give off that &#34;I-don&#39;t-belong-here&#34; sort of vibe. They came over to me sensing that I had absolutely no idea what I was doing and literally stirred up my bowl of food and mixed in the hot sauce themselves. Any other circumstance I might have been weirded out, but they were right. I definitely had no idea what I was doing and probably would have just eaten the vegetables right off the top. So, I was definitely thankful for that.

Also, the banchan was so good. There were so many things to choose from and they kept refilling the bowls whenever we ran out.

I definitely wanna come back here. Such a great first bibimbap experience.

However, next time, I&#39;m going to bring someone with me who actually speaks Korean because the language barrier was definitely a struggle."

The banchan here really is da bomb! Some yelpers say they got about 10 different banchan but we got about 7 when we went. Each of the 7 banchan were fresh and homemade and they were all so tasty! My bf and I liked the radishes, green onion pancakes (so good!) and the potato salad. We asked for seconds and they were refilled without any hassle! 

Mapo Kkak Doo Gee has a real mom n&#39; pop feel. Everyone spoke Korean inside and I don&#39;t even think the sign above the restaurant has any English in it! We only found the place by following the Yelp map and then I almost went into the wrong restaurant next door, lol! My bf ordered a dumpling soup with rice cakes and I opted for the bibimpap. Both dishes were about $10 and the portions here are huge! My bibimpap came out in a huge bowl filled with fresh veggies and the bowl of purple rice came out separately. The dumpling soup was not my favorite. I found the soup lacked flavor and I wasn&#39;t a fan of the dumplings. The rice cakes were good though. I was running a half-marathon the next morning so I guess the rice cakes counted toward my carbo loading. 

Bottom line: Though great, I still don&#39;t believe this is the BEST Korean food I&#39;ve had in Ktown so it&#39;s 3 stars for me. Service was good but parking is awful. I would suggest parking on the street and then walking over."

 After years of eating Korean food all over Los Angeles and loving it I guess I was due for a bad experience.  I went for a late lunch to a half empty restaurant and ordered  bibim nengmyun from a really annoyed server.  She finally brought me four half dishes of bachan and a half glass of water which was odd because everyone else was served eight bachans and then she finally brought my entree (cold noodles take that long??) and they were positively swimming in the spicy sauce which wasn&#39;t spicy just gross. 

After less than a third of the serving I thought it just better to give up and move on.  The waitress wouldn&#39;t come to my table even though she went to tables next to and behind me.  wtf??? I know service is sometimes different in Ktown but I&#39;ve never been flat out ignored.  I went to the register and paid Miss Congeniality and for the first time in many years did not leave a tip because of her lack of service, hostility and horrible food.

The restaurant is a little on the small side and it wasn&#39;t crowded the both times I&#39;ve been here, but there&#39;s nothing wrong with that.

My friends and I were reading the menu trying to figure out what we wanted and thoroughly confused...until we looked up and saw a wall of pictures that depicted each menu choice.  Saved our day.

I come here for the hot stone bibimbap and it is mighty good!  Comes out sizzling and packed with a lot of goodies.   They also treat you like a king with the amount of banchans they give you.  Most smaller and non-kbbq Korean restaurants I&#39;ve been to do not give as many banchan as this place.  The variety of them is good and having so many plates of banchan always fills me up.

What I recommend is coming to this place in the Winter time or on a cold day when you want something warm and homey to eat.  Their soups look especially good for a cold night!

Portions are huge.  Or maybe it&#39;s because I eat so many banchans.  But really, come hungry, leave full."

I&#39;ve noticed that there&#39;s an inverse relationship between the amount of English spoken and the quality/ authenticity of food in ethnic restaurants (seems somewhat obvious, I know). This is only slightly difficult because I speak about three phrases in Korean; I know enough to say hi, order food, and say thanks. Which is all you need really! 

Anyway, I was alone, so I got my food to go. Being that I was the only non-Korean in the restaurant, I knew I was in for some tasty authentic food. I didn&#39;t order anything too outrageous since this was my first time here (actually just got bibimbap, which I hadn&#39;t had in months and was experiencing a serious craving). The food was really good, especially considering that it had to survive a car ride home before I got to taste it. I even was given a TON of sides and kimchi in a huge to go box. I was appreciative, but it was way more food than I could eat! This place seems pretty solid, even though the atmosphere isn&#39;t spectacular.

Customer service, like all Korean restaurants, is poor. Don&#39;t let that deter you from going to real authentic Korean restaurants because Korean food is an art. Most Korean food is perfected by taste, not measurements.

However, this place is perfect when you know you want to eat Korean food, but haven&#39;t decided on what to eat yet.

Service: 5 stars! The ahjoomah servers here (middle aged women) don&#39;t look like the friendliest bunch, but they remind me of my aunts back in Korea.

Need a box to take home the yummy leftovers, no problemo~!

Location: Parking might be valet (I think depends on when you go) and the actual restaurant is tiny, but with such good food &amp; service, who cares! I love this place~

Extra bonus note: I came here during lunch on both a Friday &amp; Saturday. Friday lunch was filled with people around 12:30, but not super packed--we pre-ordered before walking over there &amp; the food was all set and ready when we arrived. Saturday lunch was more packed and we had to wait, but was at most 10-15 mins &amp; we had to valet the car ($1-2). So far tried the grilled mackerel (go-doong-uh-gooey), 2 different meat soups (yuk-geh-jang &amp; oo-guh-jee-galbi-tang)--all of it delicious &amp; spot on.

If you are, it&#39;s a great hole-in-the-wall place to get gourmet, sweat memory living, home reminding place.

Service was really great (thankfully, all 5 of us that went were Korean and spoke Korean too) and the waitresses there were helping us pick the dishes, bringing more water, more banchan, and serving this soup dish into smaller bowls for individual servings. Even the table next to us gave us a great suggestion from the menu.

There&#39;s no AC at this place and it&#39;s a really small place. If someone is eating at the table behind you, their chairs will be touching and there&#39;ll be no space to maneuver.

Food was really good and the prices were amazing. Didn&#39;t realize how great the prices were until after we received the check. Granted, I didn&#39;t pay but if I had paid, it would&#39;ve turned out to around $8.50/person for a sit-down, belly filing food.

I came here with 4 other people and we all ordered something different. And all of the dishes I tried were really good. Also, to harken what everyone else has mentioned, their banchan is really good too.

we were here yesterday and i started off not having an appetite (what???).

but when they placed all 13 banchans out for us.. i could not
resist. my favorite is their chive kimchee. super good. 

we ordered the mackerel sole  ... they gave us 3!!! one freebie fish (picture only shows 2). the fish were fresh and freshly grilled too. i added some lemon for a little zing.. but honestly, the fish were already pretty perfect. i can only remember feeling that way when i was in indonesia where the fish is served only soon after it&#39;s caught. 

another must order is their dolsot bimbimap ...still my favorite of all the places

But they have fantastic Korean food.  Go eat the fish!

It&#39;s true.  Anyway, who do we report this to?

We ordered three dishes on the menu at $12.95, $12.45 and $7.21. The bill came back at $39.00.  My partner (who is math wise, likewise is Korean and speaks Korean fluently) caught the error and showed the server.  Instead of fixing it, here&#39;s what the server did...

First she said we forgot to calculate tax.  Well, we already did, and anyway, with nine percent tax it is still way below $39. The sever wouldn&#39;t listen.  So I wrote out the math on the ticket for her.  

Then the server said, oh, she made a mistake on our ticket, she forgot that the prices had increased.  So she took the menu away from our table, placed another one, and increased $7.21 dish to $8.21.  Add one dollar more.  Well guess what, California law requires her to honor the posted prices.  But, we didn&#39;t fight it.  I added a dollar to the tabulation... still way below $39.

My partner showed it to her again.  She said no, no, no, you didn&#39;t pay for rice... and grabbed our ticket and wrote in rice!!!!!!!!!  Add another dollar.  Guess what?  STILL way below $39.  I ran through it item for item plus tax on the calculator on my smart phone.  This went on, honest to God, for twenty minutes.  We were (fraudulently) up to $37.63.  The server was STILL acting like we were in the wrong for daring to call them on their (let&#39;s be charitable and assume it is a) mistake.  But you know what they say about running a successful business? -- be rude to your customers, try to wear them down if you can, and remind them that they are always wrong, especially when you&#39;re ripping them off.  That goes over particularly well in Los Angeles.

My partner handed back the credit card, we&#39;re paying by cash.  We put together $38.00 in cash (because we didn&#39;t have change for $37.63) -- now only one dollar shy of $39.  The server stopped us and started to contest again.  This is when I snapped smart phone pictures of the menu and the ticket.  She asked for our phone numbers so her boss could contact us to settle up later.  No, no, the math is all right there, graciously giving the restaurant the illegal price increases, the fraudulently added food, the remaining math error, plus 37 cents because we didn&#39;t have coins.

And then guess what she did?  I&#39;m not making this up.  She asked, &#34;What about the tip?&#34;

So in lieu of a tip I&#39;m giving them this laboriously earned gold star here on Yelp.  

I believe in good food.  So you should go and eat that good stuff at Mapo.  You should.  But afterwards check the math!  And for the sake of all that&#39;s decent and good, all creatures great and small, soft bunnies and vulnerable children, call &#39;em on their crap.  I&#39;m curious to know your experiences!

mapo-kkak-doo-gee-restaurant-los-angeles,Nancy Y.,q_jEY68DjYJfiNzZOHVdNg,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,0,885,9,4QyxLT0EyRqPrq2WF_gwSg,2.0,2011-03-22,"Here today since I was picking up my shoes from the cobbler that has his business in the small lot.  Saw the color poster outside with $5.99 lunch specials, not sure that I wasn&#39;t going to get the usual broiled fish.  I see that the prices raised, see photo.  Now $12.35 on the fried or broiled fish plates.  Cod fish price increased by $6.  I ask the waitress which are the lunch specials, I point at the window poster in case she doesn&#39;t get it. She points to item #21, spicy beef soup so I get that. Then she goes to sit down and finish making up her pile of take out plastic bags while I wait.  More than 5 minutes she does this at a table that is directly in front of me, one by one she opens a bag and scrunches it down into narrow strips. A bit annoyed, and thinking that she&#39;s pretty cocky, she brings the banchan after she finishes up her chores.

Pretty much as I expected, the spicy beef soup has some shreds of chewy and not so tasty beef in a rather spicy broth. Lots of ban chan that is quite fresh, but doesn&#39;t really stand out.  Not bad for lunch, I should cut down on saturated fats anyway. Later, she puts the bill on the table and it&#39;s for $9.50. So, I go to the cashier and ask her about, and she walks over to the front by the food pictures, where there are dining customers.  She points out the the 3 lunch special choices, and these not #21, the spicy beef soup.

She keeps telling me the lunch specials are # so and so, not #21.  I tell her several times, &#34;That&#39;s what I asked you earlier, and you pointed to the spicy beef soup.  I&#39;m guessing she thinks she&#39;s some kind of genius and had me all figured out. She said it was the beef soup special, and I ordered it.  I said No, YOU ordered it.  I asked you what the lunch specials were, I pointed at the poster, and you pointed at #21, and you ordered it. She goes to the cashier and we go over this again several times, she says her english not so good.  I say, you understood when I just asked you the question right now.

Finally, she goes ok, ok, crosses out the $9.50 and writes $6.50.  I give her a twenty, and she still thinks she&#39;s slick. - gives me back two quarters, and three bucks, then shuts the drawer.  I say, I gave you a $20, then she goes and opens the drawer and gives me a ten.  No tip for you.  Lame, not going back, maybe business is bad and then they can close for all I care.  There is now a parking guy at the mini mall lot, $1. Downgraded the most ever, 5 to 2 stars."

You really can&#39;t go wrong with anything you order here, but the ondagu chorim is the best (spicy codfish stew?). The side dishes here are probably the best I&#39;ve had in Koreatown. They give you around 9 or 10 and you really can&#39;t go wrong with any of them. When I have friends visiting me, I always bring them to Mapo. I even got all my coworkers hooked on this place. 

The restaurant is really tiny so you will probably have to wait outside for a table, but the wait time is no longer than 15 minutes even when they are super packed. If you go after 8:00, it&#39;s usually not as crazy. Again, you can&#39;t really go wrong with any of the dishes here b/c they are ALL GOOD.

Also ordered the fettuccini with shrimp and broccoli in a pink sauce. Very good as well. About 6 shrimp in the order and the pasta was nicely cooked.

Small shopping center and you wouldn&#39;t think that an amazing Italian restaurant exist here. There is a security guard and it&#39;s safe enough.  Indoors the place needs a makeover but they have only been in business for 9 months so give them time.  

Price 
The price is just ridiculous!!!  I can&#39;t believe I had a meal with my friend for less than $30 I&#39;ve been to high end Italian restaurants and spend north of $100 for two and the food was ok and I would say even crappy compared to this place.  I posted a pic of my receipt 

Food
This is what gives the place the edge.  The garlic bread is free which is nice and thin bread but sooo good!!! The pasta is amazing fettuccini gamberreto because their sauce is creamy and freshly made shrimp are yummy and broccoli is a great touch.  The chef is from a restaurant a Beverly Hills restaurant so that kinda explains the quality. The pizza with sausage and pepperoni is super good!!! The crust is perfect and the sausage is soooo good and flavorful pepperoni is crisp and not burnt.  Just trust me and order it!!!  

Service
It&#39;s a two person show and WOW!  The young lady that serves you is sweet and attentive.  There was a soccer game on and she was kind enough to lower the volume so that I could have a conversation.  I thought that was very considerate.  The chef and owner is a total rock star!  He is happy and has passion for his craft/. I watched customers come in and greet him and he builds a relationship with his customers.  I&#39;m speechless and want everyone I know to come here!   

Misc
You can&#39;t fake this type of quality.  Believe me this place will be a hit and we will look back at the days when it only had 30 reviews and 5 stars!  Let&#39;s help put it on the map Bestia and Bottega Louie watch out!!!! (Food wise)."

I also ordered the caesar salad which was really good too. I just visited Italy over the summer and my go to was always the Frutti di Mare, tastes almost identical to the dishes I had when there.

My BF and I were waiting to eat pizza all day. 
It did NOT take me long to decide &#34;Yep, we&#39;re going here, let&#39;s go, drive.&#34; (The pictures on Yelp convinced me it would be good.)

I&#39;ve eaten at many Italian places, lots of pasta/pizza in my life. 

But none as amazing as this.

First, GREAT service. 

Chef is amazing. Very passionate. When I saw him work I thought to myself &#34;he belongs in Italy.&#34; He treats the food like a work of art. You can tell because he makes the fettuccini in FRONT of you. Literally kneads the dough and cuts the pasta in front of you. Same with the pizza.

Long story short. Food comes out. After taking some pics... We devoured it and cleared the plates. My BF and I were in heaven, haha. 

Best fettuccini I&#39;ve ever had, likely, EVER. Pink sauce, phenomenal. We ordered the shrimp and broccoli fettuccini. I could have been served this pasta at a fine dining establishment and I would have been surprised STILL how good it is... 

Pizza, high-quality, colorful, and SO good!!!

Complimentary dessert too?! Tiramisu, cheesecake, and a chocolate chip cookie --- all homemade and ALL amazing. 

All under $24?!?! We had to strike up a conversation with the genius behind this food. So we did. We will save the story. But this chef has an amazing backstory. Go eat there and find out.

I&#39;m from NorCal, but I think I&#39;ll come back here again JUST for this... We didn&#39;t get to try his favorite lobster ravioli. We will next time!!!

Ask for recommendations from the chef. You can&#39;t go wrong. I saw him making to-go orders too... And he treated THAT like fine-dining cuisine.  Geez!

We told him please do not forget us when he becomes famous. LA folks... Try this place and support this restaurant. It&#39;s RARE that I offer this type of praise or even write long reviews.  This place deserves it!"

And my boyfriend costumed one of his dishes as a penne with carbonara sauce and it was so delicious . The restaurant it&#39;s very small but don&#39;t be fooled their food is GREAT !!! I would highly recommend all my pasta lover friends !"

The seafood pasta taste so good!! That&#39;s  a lot of fresh seafood for 12bucks. I don&#39;t regret ordering the chocolate chip cooks anymore either, they served as the perfect dessert, had to stop myself from eating too many.

Located on Venice and western its central to everything! I was warmly greeted by everyone there and got to watch the copa finals there as well. The food is amazing! I got the spaghetti Bolognese and it was A+. The portion was HUgE and it even came with tramisu! Best part of all this is this dinner cost me less than $13!!! I would make this my go to spot for pasta now!

Wow, we were blown away by the service and the food. I hardly write reviews, basically only to talk about the worst experience or the best; and by far this was one of the best restaurants I&#39;ve been to. Everyone was so friendly and as soon as our first dish came out, we were smitten with the food. The chef is A+ and couldn&#39;t have asked for more in terms of food. We just hope they get their liquor license so we can enjoy some wine with our meal."

However, the great food and excellent service deserve the top rating. To start, we received a complimentary basket of pizza crust. I asked for some balsamic vinegar and out came a delicious, thick balsamic with olive oil. With the crispy pizza crust, we could have made a meal of this alone. Our actual dishes, a Rustica salad and a lasagna dish, both were delicious. The lasagna came out piping out and had a rich, tasty sauce with a perfect combination of meat, pasta, and cheese. The salad was fresh and had what must have been half an avocado on top. To our surprise, the restaurant brought us a chocolate chip and a delicious, creamy strawberry panna cotta for dessert on the house! I look forward to trying the pizza the next we come here."

(I want to make sure they remember me when they read this.) The salad was the yellowest parts of the romaine- with boxed croutons. The pizza was deemed edible by my squad but i thought it tasted funny, but the pasta. Oh god. It was enough for 5 people. And it was sour. So bad. Like- baaaaad. So this wasn&#39;t the first time my food was sub-par and I&#39;m tired of paying and getting shafted. So I took back the pasta and the salad. The CHEF gave me shit about it- like it was something I did wrong. I was trying to be nice- avoiding a shitty review- by giving him a chance to say something more like- &#34; I&#39;m sorry&#34; or &#34;let&#39;s us make it up to you&#34;. After I drove all the way back there- he says- &#34; what? You want something free?&#34; Oh heeeeeeeeell no. I PAID for this food. I just expect YOU to give a damn that I wasn&#39;t happy. I&#39;m done. Never again. 1 star for the cheesecake tho. It&#39;s fire. AND you shouldn&#39;t have a bunch of little thugs hanging out in your spot. It&#39;s not a good look. Ciao, Nonna."

The plain cheese pizza was flimsy, undercooked-but-still-burnt-on-the-bottom, essentially flavorless and eating it was about as fun as getting third degree sunburn while freezing. The cheese is orange. &#34;But hey, maybe the sauce underneath the cheese just makes it APPEAR orange.&#34; No. There is no sauce. The cheese is orange. There was another pizza with sausage/peppers/onions that tasted like a 3-year-old&#39;s first attempt at making a sausage sandwich using frozen pizza as the bread. I ate this pizza and then I stubbed my toe and I&#39;m pretty sure those events were related. I ate this pizza and now I can&#39;t have children."

Super hungry, we hoped they had some good pasta.  I called in beforehand to ask if the pasta contained egg, because my fiancé and I are vegan. They remembered this when we came in, and made us a fresh batch of pasta- from scratch! THE best pasta we have had, we couldn&#39;t get over how good it was. It was just marinara and veggies on fettuccine, but the ingredients were so fresh, the pasta was chewy &amp; the sauce was amazing! We also ordered a vegetarian pizza, no cheese &amp; extra sauce...also delicious- the crust was perfect - slight crunch on the bottom. We were pretty full, but they brought us dessert, on the house!  It was a custard pie and a chocolate chip cookie....so good we got cookies to go! Highly recommend this place, the service is great &amp; the owner is very friendly. Loved everything!"

But I&#39;ll get to that later. The expression &#34;DON&#39;T JUST A BOOK BY ITS COVER&#34; best describes my opinion of this restaurant. There were so many amazing Yelp reviews so I knew I wanted to try this place. Is the location great??  No. It the parking area nice.? No!!   Is the food delicious??  YES. It the value exceptional??  YES. Does the family running this place make you feel welcomed? YES!! Will I go back again????  ABSOLUTELY!!!!!  We shared 3 dishes. First..the chopped vegetable salad. After my first bite, I knew I chose right. It was amazing!. Vegetables perfectly cooked....they weren&#39;t too soft and still had the perfect amount of firmness. The dressing on this salad was exceptional!!!!! I can&#39;t wait to go back and have it again . For entrees we shared the spaghetti and meatballs and the lemon chicken.  I wanted to lick the plate after eating the chicken. It was tender and sooooooo flavorful!!! It came with pasta or veggies..we chose the veggies. Once again...perfectly seasoned and cooked veggies. As much as we loved the spaghetti and the sauce..we both agree we would not get the meatballs again. They were a bit too firm for our liking...but the pasta and the sauce was a winner !!! For some reason I thought I read that the pasta was homemade...maybe I was wrong because when I went up to pay the bill...I saw a package of fettuccini. I can&#39;t verify if the other pasta is homemade...but it doesn&#39;t really matter because it was perfect as it was.  The homemade bread was INCREDIBLE as well!! To top of this already amazing meal...we were given a complimentary dessert....again....amazing!! The owner / chef was very warm and friendly. It&#39;s obvious he cares about what he cooks!! Give this place a try and don&#39;t be discouraged by the exterior. Once inside....you will be enjoying your food so much your forget about the outside.

 I love finding &#39;hole in the wall&#39; gems like this. I only wish a few changes were made on the inside to improve the ambience. Perhaps red and white checkered table clothes and some Italian music. That would make it perfect . I&#39;ll be back!!!"

I wish the place was bigger because man is it tiny, but it&#39;s so close to my apartment, and it serves high quality food.

Food: 4/5
I&#39;ve had the falafel plate, egg plate, and the lamb meatballs. If it&#39;s your first time, definitely try one of the plates! You&#39;ll get a bit of everything. The zatar they spread of the pita bread is delicious, and I love all the different pickled veggies they include. I actually prefer the egg or lamb meatballs to the falafel. The falafel is a little one dimensional tasting - I&#39;m comparing theirs to Falafel Drive Inn back in San Jose where I&#39;m from. So far, nothing has come close to Falafel Drive Inn. However, their egg is cooked perfectly, and the lamb meatballs are perfectly spiced. I enjoy coming here when I&#39;m trying to get something healthy and filling!"

First of all it&#39;s kind of hard to find. Theres no parking lot, but right in front there&#39;s a whole row of metered parking. If those are full then along glendale blvd. there&#39;s a lot of meters too! Dune&#39;s is the one with the white tarp/umbrella. The interior is very very small. DO NOT BRING A MASSIVE GROUP HERE. (they do have tables outside too)!

I always get the falafel plate. Their hummus is one of the best! Their falafel is very good too! The plate comes with 3 falafel. The price is around $12 and honestly it&#39;s worth the price. I love how much color and variety of veggies they give with this place. TRY IT WITH THE LOUISANA HOT SAUCE THEY HAVE THERE! It&#39;s so good! I believe extra pita bread was around $3??  The plate looks small but i&#39;m always soooo stuffed after.

They also do to go orders! I&#39;ve ordered on the phone but I had such a hard time getting through to them. I&#39;m not sure if they were busy or something but the line would just be the busy tone or would just hang up on its own. So maybe of they fixed that then it would be perfect!!

Hope you guys love this place!! One of my favorite LA spots !!!"

My boyfriend &amp; I have had Dune on our list of places to try. We&#39;ve drooled over Instagram pics of their Falafel sandwich that&#39;s topped with yummy-looking potato strings.

We ordered the Falafel sandwich which was $10. It&#39;s a pretty big sandwich. Housemade pita &amp; potato strings are good but falafel itself is just okay. (I could have used more potato strings because who doesn&#39;t like crispy potato strings, right?)

I still have yet to try a falafel that&#39;s better than Kareem&#39;s in Anaheim, CA though. All these LA spots try to bedazzle their falafels by making them all fancy with non-traditional toppings &amp; whatever it may be. They forget the important thing which is making their falafel tasty.

Dune&#39;s falafel did taste better than Falabar&#39;s falafel though. 

As for other menu items, we found them to be really pricey. $8 for hummus, really? We&#39;ll pass, thank you."

Pros:
Quality and quantity of the food. The Lamb and hummus plate could feed 2 people. 
I loved all of the different pickled items that all matched well with the super umami lamb patties. Pickled onion, turnips, cabbage, mixed greens, salt cured olives, and hummus. I ate it all with the pizza dough like grilled bread, their green chutney and some pickled chilies. 

Cons: 
Hipster apocalypse. If you don&#39;t have a beard and a sleeve tat you are out of place. 100% Bernie and Hillary supporters. 
Parking sucks balls. Enough said.
Pricey. $19 for lamb and hummus plate with a $3.50 sparkling water.

It is paired with the perfectly cooked falafel, fresh pita bread, greens and marinated cabbage. Altogether a very filling meal at $11. I will definitely be coming back soon!

Pickled veg, super smooth creamy hummus, salads, spices, pickled veg.  It&#39;s like a Mediterranean bento box with little morsels of color, flavor, texture, and good smells.

All of ur veggie friends will go freakin crazy for this place and u will leave full and happy too even if u order just the falafel plate.

I left covered in flour dust from the homemade flatbread and with leftovers for a mid afternoon snack.

Sat next to someone that had the avocado toast and the 8 min egg. It looked good but the falafel has me hooked.

Not cheap but worth it. About $10.50 for the falafel plate and $4 I think for extra falafel... And worth every penny.

Ambiance-- casual rustic? Counter seats comfy for solo diners and a few tables outside.

Parking can be difficult... Tons of metered parking but you may have to do laps. Also 1-2 hr public lots across the street. I can see why it was rated one of the 10 best falafel a in LA."

Their menu is simple and so very nutritious. I love love love my veggies and my heart goes all a flutter when I set my eyes on any of their colourful plates and sandwiches. Most recently, I had the Hummus and Falafel plate which was divine. It came with pickled beets, greens, marinated red onions, hummus, olives, hummus, etc. Their house flat bread is my favourite and it comes with any of their plates. It has garlic and herbs and it was served hot! What a perfect accompaniment to their hummus. The falafel was good. Crispy on the outside and very flavourful. 

The Pasture Raised Lamb Sandwich is also amazing. This one comes with house flat bread, toum, lemon turmeric yogurt, marinated onions, and seasonal greens. I love how they seasoned the lamb! Make sure to try their mango chutney. It is heavenly! It reminded me of this Mediterranean place I used to frequent in Germany when I lived there. 

This place is across Proof Bakery and situated right next to The Juice. Just look for the white awning. Overall great service but very small interior. There are only around 10 or so seats inside but there are tables outside as well."

The melange of different ingredients and flavors in the sandwich, some of which had a slightly unconventional twist, worked so well together!!

I also had the feta cheese side which was a good portion and was delicious!  The combination of the fixings inside the falafel were just perfect!  Such a creative combination of flavors.  And the flat bread is the best wrap bread I&#39;ve ever had!!  It&#39;s warm and soft and flavorful.  I can&#39;t say enough about this place.  My new neighborhood fave for sure!

I&#39;m kind of in love with beets, so when I found out they had a pickled beet sandwich, I knew I had to try it.

You walk into the small space but it&#39;s very cutesy. Their menu is written along a wall of mirrors and you can look straight into the kitchen and see what everyone is doing. They have a couple high top seats along the wall but that&#39;s it. there is seating outside. 

For $9 I got a hefty sized pickled beet sandwich and this is what it comes with (straight from the menu)- Bub and Grandma&#39;s ciabatta, toum, pickled beets, capers, kalamata olives, marinated onions, Bulgarian sheep feta, 8-minute egg, shoestring potatoes, season greens.

I loved the pickled beets, the Bulgarian sheep feta, and the shoestring potatoes. I wish it would have come with more! Greedy? Yes.

But seriously, everything in this sandwich was delicious. I couldn&#39;t have picked a better place to have lunch.

Will be back for the iced Morrocan mint tea!!! And to try other dishes. The flavors are on point here."

When we walked into this tiny little restaurant, we walked to the register and ordered the following (prices include tax):

Village Salad, $7 - When I ordered this, the girl at the register told me that they ran out of Bulgarian sheep feta. I asked her if I would still be charged the full price. She told me that I would and so I asked if I be able to get a protein substitute since there is no more cheese. She said I could and so I opted for falafel. Now I just want to mention that this employee didn&#39;t bother to offer me the option of getting a substitute for the lack of cheese and was still planning on charging me the full price for a salad that is missing the cheese. 

Anyways, this salad was pretty disappointed, as it wasn&#39;t a salad at all. It was basically crudite of thick slices of raw red onions (about 1/2 an onion), a few slices of sweet tomato and cucumber slices. I had asked for the dressing on the side, which I had a feeling the employees chopped this up for me as I had ordered it since it took so long to get this order. 

The dressing was just basically olive oil with some kind of seasoning on the bottom, which I did not really care for. The raw vegetables were just basic. I was really disappointed about getting a large amount of raw onions, which I didn&#39;t bother to eat (what a waste).

I had ordered this to go and unfortunately when they packed it in a brown paper bag, the styrofoam that this came in leaked all over the bag. 

Side order of Falafel, $4- Normally a side of falafel (2 pieces with hummus) would cost $4 but I was able to get this for free because they ran out of cheese for my salad. Now I have read from a few previous yelp reviews that this is one of the best falafels those particular yelpers have ever had. I thought the falafel was good/ standard but definitely not the best (I really have had better). I liked the hummus that came with the falafel (and used that with my &#34;salad&#34; instead of the olive oil that it came with).

Pasture Raised Lamb Sandwich, $10- My husband opted for this, which was a pretty big size for one person. The lamb itself was tasty (including the flat bread sandwich itself), but quite heavy in the seasonings (including garlic). My husband&#39;s breath had that seasoning breath all night (totally gross if you ask me). So in case you are here for a 1st date, don&#39;t order this or make sure you have some mouth wash (because gum and mints won&#39;t help you). 
-----------------------
(Total= $17 prior to tip, after tax)


It was really hard to understand the girl at the register taking my order. She was mumbling the entire time and so I had to ask her to repeat herself a few times. 

Seating inside this eatery is limited to about 10 ish bar stool chairs. There are a few tables and chairs outside (with umbrellas at each table). 

Overall, I am pretty disappointed with this place and honestly wouldn&#39;t come back. The food was average 

By the way, there are no public restrooms. Parking is just street parking. We were unfortunate to find any so we parked at the Starbucks parking lot down the street (the parking lot is only available for those visiting the businesses in that little lot. So we ended up getting a drink before walking down the street to Dune)."

If you&#39;ve ever had L As du Falafel, you know excellent falafel is impossible to find anywhere outside Paris. However, I think of all the falafels I have had in California, this one is the best so far. (still searching of course)

The bread was home made. Chewy, thick, warm, sturdy. Ahh, I love it when they get bread right!!! the falafels were just fried, perfectly seasoned and crunchy, with a gorgeous green inside upon biting. The wrap is difficult to eat since it is loaded with picked veggies, garlic and whatnot. Grab a couple forks.

The LAMB was excellent too. Huge lamb meatballs, not gamey at all, juicy and flavorful. The spread, the bread, the fillings. It all works!

Only meh thing were the drinks. The lemonade was too sour and the mint tea too plain. Service was excellent, I can&#39;t wait to come back again.

You can&#39;t find the name, just look for JUICE next door. Its the one with the white awning. Outside seating, inside just a few tall chairs.

Falafel + Lamb + 2 drinks + tip = $26.

I learned that the vegetables were locally sourced.  Based on the price point and flavor, it was evident that Dune was focus on providing amazing meals at great prices and not using &#34;organic and local&#34; as buzzwords to overcharge customers.  That&#39;s how it&#39;s done.  And it&#39;s a winning formula since they&#39;ve been around for more than a year.

The arugula included was different; it was peppery.  The pickled items in the jars added a kick if you&#39;re looking for it.

It was definitely busy but not packed, and probably just looked slightly chaotic inside because of the small space they have.

The menu is written on a mirror wall, which is fine and stylish, but I had no idea what I was reading. Thank god they have paper menus at the register!
I went with the falafel and hummus plate, and the falafels were fresh and crispy, and stayed warm even after the drive home. The bread was excellent, and the pickled veggies were a great addition. Everything felt really fresh. 

Make sure to grab a couple tiny plastic to-go containers of the two condiments they provide! The green one is spicy, which was a great other layer to add to my meal. The preserved lemon was great too, but since the meal already had citrus in in, I ended up not using it as much.

When I called to them, all they said was if I couldn&#39;t drive the ten miles back that next time they would make up for it.  Like I&#39;m going to go back and be like &#34;hey remember me? I ordered food and you guys didn&#39;t give me all of it and instead of offering a refund, told me to come back and ask for free food like some cheap weirdo!&#34;

Whatever, I decided to stop being a diva and try the food I did have.  I threw it away after one bite and went to get another dinner :( Obviously there won&#39;t be a next time."

Big flavor I mean. 

Falafel to me is dry but just enough tahini mixed in helps to eat and enjoy this particular food. It was a good mix, great textures thanks impart to the shoe string potatoes and pickled beets. The pita was the kicker though. Baked nice and fluffy with a char to its outer edges. Loved every bite!"

There was so much hype around Dune about a year ago when it first opened.  So, of course I was eager to try it, but now I am finally getting around to stopping by to try it.  I got the original falafel sandwich, and which it was quite good but I would not say it was amazing.  Most of the components were pretty delicious, especially those shoe-string fries!

Customers seem to be mostly locals and in the short time that I was there, I heard a lot of raving from return customers regarding the quality of the food.  It is very hidden and not labeled on the outside (I was actually confused at first because I only saw the flanking stores initially when looking for Dune).  They have good outdoor seating options that allow customers to enjoy the beautiful LA weather and scenery.

I ordered the pasture raised lamb sandwich for ~13$ and was a little disappointed in the price to food ratio since it is shown as 1 money sign on yelp -- however, it is probably reasonable for LA.  Sandwich was very fresh and flavorful  They also had different types of zesty sauces available for use.

Overall, very fresh and very delicious.  Definitely one of the best Mediterranean places I have tried."

We opted for the hummus and falafel plate and a side of their Village (Israeli-ish) salad. Easily a smart strategy if you&#39;re looking to share. Falafel was some of the best I&#39;ve had in L.A. - the first bite was enough to transport me to a small arab village in Israel that I visit each time I head out there. The hummus plate also comes with the essentials - the cabbage salad, pickled beets, olives, etc. And the flatbread isn&#39;t exactly pita but equally fresh and tasty. Strengths of this restaurant: it&#39;s able to stay &#39;authentic&#39; - especially regarding taste- while playing around a bit with a few dishes that combine traditional Middle Eastern ingredients with elements of our local (health-obsessed) diet.

The lamb was cooked correctly and very tender, and the sauce on each sandwich was very good (if a bit more sour than I might prefer, but that is nitpicking). To me the portions were a tiny bit too small, for my wife, they were a bit too large, but what are you gonna do? The meat and falafel are pretty solid but the bread is truly fantastic.

My office is in Glendale, which makes my lunch decisions incredibly repetitive all the time. (either whole foods or carousel) but after trying Dunes, I definitely think I have a new favorite! And just MINUTES away from me! 

Obsessed with their avocado toast with tomato confit. You can just taste the freshness. Yum. 

Another two favorites, the falafel wrap + beet sandwich. Amazing! Both are so rich in flavor, yet light on the stomach. Finding this combo was definitely a plus for me. I hate heavy lunches. I ordered the beet sandwich without the 8 minute egg, just because I&#39;m not such a fan of the over easy egg.

This tiny, casual, order-at-the-counter-and-find-a-seat place is easy to miss - right between Heartbeat house and Kaldi coffee. They have a menu written on a mirrored wall as well as some paper menus. I was immediately taken with all of the tempting options - many vegan, some familiar, and all affordable - but finally settled on the blood orange salad and hummus plate. The register guy was very friendly and offered helpful answers to my questions (I have a dairy allergy so always have to check ingredients) - and the total was just over $10!

My food came out about 5 minutes later and I was immediately excited by all of the color. Both dishes were generously portioned, and included many fixings. The sweet, spicy aromas alone were intoxicating, and the food was just as great. Each bite was jam-packed with bright flavors and different textures (smooth hummus; crisp fermented cabbage; warm, chewy, fresh bread). I stuffed myself silly and would have kept eating if there was more in front of me. The quality of the ingredients and cooking was apparent, and the new mixtures of flavors had me hooked.

In case it isn&#39;t obvious, I&#39;ll be back as soon as I can. Dune is one of the best hidden gems LA has to offer."

Hummus was excellent too."

As a disclaimer, I&#39;m not a huge Mediterranean food guy but I actually really enjoyed the food here.

The first thing I liked was that they use really good pita bread for their sandwiches. I&#39;m not even sure if you can call it pita--it&#39;s more like naan, or a Taco Bell chalupa shell on steroids. It&#39;s super crispy and doughy at the same time. Yum.

I tried the lamb sandwich and the falafel sandwich which were both pretty good. The lamb was so ridiculously garlicky that I was burping up vampire-slaying bullets deep into the night. I love garlic but it was maybe a tad overkill. The falafel sandwich was really flavorful and came with a really good yogurt sauce that totally brought it all together. It was a little bit salty though!

For sides, I tried the tabouleh, which was my favorite part of Dune. Their tabouleh is super good, clean, and fresh. My least favorite part was the lemonade. It was just way too acidic for my taste--I felt like I was drinking liquid Warheads.

This place is definitely a work in progress, as it doesn&#39;t have seating yet and the kitchen is slow (took quite awhile to get the food both times I came). I think it definitely has 5 star potential, as the dedication to quality and freshness is all there. You can smell and feel the love they put into the food the moment you walk in.

Just as Momed isn&#39;t your typical mediterranean recipe house, Dune has done a 1-up (+1 modifier, bonus score, whatever you&#39;d like to call it) on pretty much everything on the menu. A tweak of cardamom here, a pinch of cinnamon there, or even dill weed somewhere in the works makes these otherwise traditional middle republic favorites shine beyond their contemporary competitors (and given we&#39;re in the middle of &#34;turn and you&#39;ll find another kabob&#34; Glendale - that&#39;s a steep order of business to make happen.)
 Traceable goodness at really reasonable prices (and virtually bargain level, given even if you didn&#39;t pony up for a full sandwich or a plate, you could stuff yourself on the gorgeous side dishes at a buck or two a piece.)
 Generous portions, with no fillers - meaning, it&#39;s not iceberg or romaine, it&#39;s local baby arugula and micro greens. Every item has been thoughtfully balanced between protein, carbs and veggies in a 1:1:4 ratio.
 Every single baked good from ciabattas, to the rustic rolls, to their flatbread are tasty and delicious without anything on them.  Adding more just makes it a magical tasting meal.
 The Bocquerones toasts were a take on fresh white anchovy filets that were unexpectedly amazing - hard to describe, but kind of like there&#39;s preserved lemon in the vinaigrette, and a mint/purple onion/green peppercorn undercurrent that takes you by surprise.  No, it&#39;s not anchovies, as on a pizza.  These are like the delicate sprats or smelts we see back East (pick your continent - all 3 have them in the Eastern regions.)
 Pickled beet sandwich was everything everyone else has raved about - and incredible invention in and of itself. The pickled nomenclature shouldn&#39;t be over-emphasized; they&#39;re not like vinegary-style beets. These are much more subtle and roasted. Mix in those needle-thin shoestring potato fries, and it&#39;s something you start craving every time.
 Note to self:Toum/Toumya = Aioli = Mujdei = Skordalia (minus the potatoes) = Agliata (minus the vinegar) = Joe&#39;s Garlic Sauce (see Whole Foods) = garlicky goodness you want to shmear on everything in sight.
 Located between the fresh Juicery and the Beathouse dance studio, I guess it&#39;s a juice-up, chow-down, then work it all back off and repeat arrangement of stores.
 Indoor seating is barstool wall counter style (up to about 10) and outdoors are 6 or 7 shared patio tables.
  Parking is contemporary Atwater Village (unless you college parking pounce on the street diagonals, it&#39;s easier to find parking a block on either side of Glendale beyond the meters.)"

I was hungry... and hunger is a hunger that she could never satisfy (she&#39;s definitely tried though...................................)
2. We ran as fast as we could to my car and vroomed over to Dune. The ride was quick, but with company like Honor, it couldn&#39;t be long enough. We must&#39;ve kissed at every stop sign and red light. Maybe even a few green lights too ;-)
3. As soon as we entered we encountered a real treat: Carlos! Even though he was wearing a khaki colored hat, I knew what mane of hair was hidden beneath. I wish I could comb my fingers through his scalp and stop at a few red lights with him in tow. But that was a faint fantasy... Here I was *NOW*! With Honor in tow. What is fantasy? What is reality? &#34;What can I get you?&#34; he said, his eyelashes fluttering like two hearts in cardiac arrest. &#34;Focus on his words, not his lips,&#34; I thought to myself. Honor gave me a stare. What&#39;s real? What I have or what I could only hope for? The answer was obvious. &#34;I would like the Hummus Plate with Egg.&#34; He took my money. And I fell into it. Like a daydream. Or a fever...
4. I blinked. Carlos and Honor were still there. &#34;I&#39;m gonna get a coffee,&#34; I thought. &#34;I&#39;m gonna get a coffee,&#34; I said. So I did. I got a coffee next door from Kaldi Coffee.

5. I grabbed my fork, I grabbed my woman, and I filled my mouth with Mediterranean delights. Hummus, pita, egg, and an assortment of veggies. She smiled at me. Her enjoyment was apparent. &#34;I love.....&#34; her eyes sparkled at me, &#34;....to get lunch with you!&#34; She thought I was going to say something else. But I didn&#39;t. And who cares? Every emptiness was being filled with only the best of food for $7.50.
6. Carlos stopped by with a small plate of desserts. &#34;It&#39;s our one year anniversary. Enjoy.&#34; He smiled without ever moving his lips and left us. I was so full I couldn&#39;t imagine eating more. I looked at Honor. She felt the same way. We were closing in on our one year anniversary. I thought back to our first kiss. My first time eating at Dune with Andrew. I reached for her hand. I held her tight. Carlos was greeting a new customer.
7. I used to get the Falafel Sandwich at Dune. But now I get the Hummus Plate. I used to be single. But now I have Honor. Dune &amp; Honor. I&#39;ve never felt so complete. I&#39;ve never felt so Useful™, Funny™, and Cool™. Honor knew it. Carlos could sense it. Can you?
8. I&#39;d like to address user &#34;David S.&#34; and their &#34;review&#34; of Dune. It appears that they had a bad experience. They (supposedly) didn&#39;t get half of their order. And when they (supposedly) bit into their dinner? They (supposedly) threw it out! I don&#39;t know about you, but when I&#39;m (actually) hungry I wouldn&#39;t throw out (delicious) food, spend the time writing words on the packaging, and then take a picture of it for Yelp. User &#34;David S.&#34; should spend less time stringing words together online and instead speak directly to a human being. Maybe then &#34;David S.&#34; won&#39;t exhibit the behavior of a baby throwing a tantrum because (supposedly) things didn&#39;t go their way :-)
9. Isn&#39;t that strange though? We live in a world where people would rather passively complain about things online than speak directly to a human being and seek resolution? Maybe some people don&#39;t want resolution, but instead, actively pursue reasons to be publicly unhappy. Pretty cool that Yelp™ gives these people a forum to speak in :-)
10. &#34;Thank you,&#34; Carlos said. I looked at Honor. I looked outside. We left. Hand in hand. I looked inside. No regrets. Except for one... &#34;Honor?&#34; &#34;Yes,&#34; she said, looking into my eyes for something I had been hiding. &#34;I love..........&#34; Silence. We stood there waiting for the traffic light to change. Silence. Nearly an hour passed. She stood there patiently. &#34;..........You.&#34; She knew exactly what I meant. And in that moment.... So.......... did................ I........................... :-)"

Overall, this is a clean and cool restaurant to dine.

Pros:
- Taste: I ordered Hummus and Falafel plate, and my friend ordered beets sandwich.  They are both tasty, and I can see these foods were prepared with care.

- Visual: The food was served in very organized looking. My eyes enjoyed along with my taste buds.

- Kitchen: I was able to watch how chefs are working in kitchen when I made my order.  I thought the kitchen was well organized, and chefs were working with dedication.

Cons:
- There were limited number of chairs in the restaurant. I sit at the table outside.  The Sun light was a bit too intense.  It was nicer if there are enough shade.

- I parked in a backstreet. It takes some time to walk to the restaurant. Otherwise I needed to pay for the parking."

Pretty dissapointed. I always pass by the area on the way to the gym. So was glad to see there was a Mediterranean place nearby. And with this many reviews I took my friend after our workout for a quick lunch. It&#39;s a little hard to find as they don&#39;t really have a big sign. It&#39;s right next to the Juice store. It&#39;s real tiny inside. I would say a few seats, luckily there is more seating outside for the public. You order at the front and they bring your food out. The menu is pretty simple. They have about 3 Sandwiches, Plates (Served with a side of house flat bread, malfouf, olives, greens), Salads and sides. Price is pretty reasonable.

_Pasture Raised Lamb ($10) House flat bread, toum, lemon turmeric yogurt, marinated onions, seasonal greens. I was expecting a sandwich or some sort of sandwich wrap but instead it was the flatbread on the bottom and 3 lamb meatballs on top, along with the toppings. You can&#39;t even really pick it up to eat it so we just ate it all separate. The meatballs were good, but a bit bland. Lacked flavor and depth. I thought the lamb would be sliced but it was shaped in meatballs. The flat bread itself was good. Tasted like olive oil and garlic. I liked the pickled onions and the arugula and sauce. Somewhat light and filling. 
_Hummus &amp; Falafel ($10) Served with a side of house flat bread, malfouf, olives, greens. 3 big sized falafel. Nicely fried and soft in the inside. A little plain in flavor but goes well with all the sides on the plate. The hummus was good and smooth. I liked the flat bread, it had a nice garlic flavor to it. The pickled cabbage was tangy and paired well with the falafel, as well as the pickled bites on the side. The plate was good, healthy and hearty.

Not the best I&#39;ve had but I would come again to try their other plates and sandwiches. The food is decent and healthy, and the price is reasonable."

The guy that brought my plate brings out a humus plate with what looks like cabbage salad.  Not sure what they consider taboulee.   I thought maybe it was just a mix up on the order so I asked the guy that brought out my food if this was the humus and taboulee plate.   He was curt and said,  &#34;I didn&#39;t take your order, I just got here.&#34;  But all I asked was if this was the humus and taboulee plate.   He just walked away after his curt response.  He made no effort to resolve my question or issue.   Seemed annoyed I even asked him a question.   This was my first time here and probably will be my last.

There isn&#39;t a grilled cheese in the world that wouldn&#39;t be improved by bacon; I&#39;ve never even eaten a veggie burger. Dune is home to the best exception I&#39;ve ever run across: the amazing pickled beet sandwich. If I were a vegetarian, this place would be my lifesaver.

I came for a weekday lunch with my friend Esther A. The place was pretty calm, with just a few of the outdoor tables occupied. The set-up was casual, with counter ordering and self-seating, and I liked the clean, inviting vibe. Service was quick and friendly, and we sat on stools along a counter that ran across one side of the space.

I ordered the pickled beet sandwich because the friend who recommended Dune swore by it, and I&#39;m glad I ignored my instincts and listened to her advice. It was one of the best (and most attractive) sandwiches I&#39;ve had in recent memory--fresh, fluffy ciabatta bursting with pickled beets, Bulgarian sheep feta, 8-minute egg, shoestring potatoes, seasonal greens, capers, kalamata olives, marinated onions, and toum, a kicky garlic sauce. The beets were delicious, flavorful and tender but firm, perfect with the lush feta and the supple, bright-yolked egg. The onions, olives, and capers gave the sandwich a nice vivacious freshness, and the toum and potatoes brought extra flavor and substance. Everything just worked. The only problem was there was so much, well, meat to this sandwich that every time I took a bite, I spilled beets and cheese and greens onto my plate. (I ate every spilled bit in time.) Esther also got a vegetarian lunch, hers a plate of hummus and falafel. This was another extraordinary lunch, a colorful plate of hummus and falafel arranged with house flat bread, house pickles, marinated cabbage and onions, olives, and seasonal greens. She couldn&#39;t finish the thing, so I did my duty as a good friend and helped her out. The hummus was smooth and rich with flavor, and the falafel was among the best I&#39;ve ever had, crispy on the outside without a hint of dryness to the vibrant green insides. I also loved the accompanying pickles and cabbage. There was a lot to eat on this plate.

This was just a wonderful accidentally vegetarian meal, and I hope to repeat it as many times as possible. I&#39;m happy to have Dune a short drive from my house, and look forward to more beet sandwiches and hummus plates in my near future."

The first time I ordered it came out on a piece of pita way too small for the giant beautiful homemade mess that was atop.  The other times the ratio was a lil easier to work with.

I got the hummus &amp; lamb plate, and everything was delicious. The pickled veggies that the plate comes with paired perfectly with the hummus and the meat. However, mango chutney they have has a very strong, assertive briny flavor, so I&#39;d use only a little bit. As good as my plate was, my partner&#39;s falafel sandwich was even better. I will forever hold all other falafels I eat to Dune&#39;s falafels...so crispy and nutty and melt-in-your-mouth at the same time.

There&#39;s not a huge amount of seating--what I&#39;d call &#34;counter&#34; seating inside and then a number of outdoor tables---so it seems more like a place for a quick bite than somewhere you&#39;d linger for a long time, but that was fine for tonight.

The young woman working the counter--it&#39;s counter ordering and then they bring you your food--was very helpful. As much as I&#39;d heard about the falafel, I have a hard time passing up lamb, so after a brief consultation, we worked it out: I&#39;d order the lamb sandwich with a side order of falafel. It turned out to be plenty of food, but not so much as to be too much. It came out within about 10 minutes (everything is cooked to order). I first attacked the falafel. It was indeed very good. It&#39;s moist and comes with a tasty sauce (tahini, I believe) and a small portion of hummus surrounding it. The hummus was fine, but it wasn&#39;t quite the equal of the falafel.

The lamb sandwich was by and large a success. The lamb meatballs were fairly moist (probably a 7 or 8/10 in that department), and they came with a lemon yogurt sauce and marinated/pickled onions. The one thing that kept the lamb from being altogether successful, at least for me, was the sauce: the lemon flavor was a bit too aggressive and verged on overpowering the other ingredients.

All in all, though, this is a very good spot serving tasty food and staffed by knowledgeable friendly folks--and all at a reasonable price point. I&#39;d certainly come back."

This makes up 2/3 of their sandwich menu, so I&#39;ll have to return sometime for the beet and feta sandwich, but I was overall very impressed with what I tried.  First, the bread from each was very good, about 1/4 inch thick with some nicely browned spots, pliable but with quite a bit more chew than a pita.  

The falafel sandwich, with a smear of hummus, tahini, pickles, and a small amount of finely shredded fried potatoes, I would rate as one of the better I&#39;ve had in LA.  The one downside for me (as a personal preference) was the size of the falafel, as they&#39;re pretty big (like larger than a golf ball).  So even though they&#39;re freshly fried (a must for any falafel!) there&#39;s a lot of interior versus crispy exterior.  That aside, they are still pretty light, and are very nicely herbaceous.  

I personally enjoyed the lamb more.  Three small meatballs, essentially, of ground lamb cooked to medium with a good exterior crust but still very juicy.  They had a nice gamey note that you hope for with lamb that stood through without being overpowering amongst all the other flavors.  The yogurt sauce, a pale yellow with turmeric, provided a nice counterpoint to the salty, crispy lamb, and the seasonal greens added a nice freshness to the sandwich.  Really well composed, and something I&#39;d definitely order again.

Also, the two side sauces were excellent!  The green hot sauce (zhug?  I didn&#39;t ask specifically but similar) didn&#39;t add much heat but provided a tart counterpoint to the sandwiches.  My favorite was the second, the mango pickle that was a little like a chunky amba sauce, which provided a sweet, tart side note to the gamey lamb.  

Overall I was really impressed, and I&#39;m definitely glad this restaurant is close to where I live.  The menu is short, but they seem to do those items quite well, which is all I really hope for in a restaurant!  The space is small, with one register, so I imagine things can get quite slow when they are busy (which they probably will be very soon, all the time) but it was fast on a Thursday night.  Prices were pretty moderate - it&#39;s not exactly cheap, but a good value for the quality of ingredients and the care they put into making their food."

I also tried the gyoza. I loved it! My favorite soup base is the Miso, but I also like the shoyu. I usually add egg because I think it&#39;s a staple. 

The only thing that would make it better? Boiled egg included as standard and if they would expand! The seating area is really small. Last time I went it was raining and they couldn&#39;t utilize all of their outdoor seating.

-- Located in Weller Court with several other shops, as well as the super awesome Real Escape Room. They have a convenient parking garage, and Orochon does validate, but you may end up paying the max rate anyway if you stay a while ($9.25).
-- Lots of customization options, with a wide range of spicy levels and topping choices.
-- Each table has a cool button you can press to bring your waiter over :)
-- Portions are huge!
-- You can sit inside or outside. They were able to accommodate my party of 7 outside on a Sunday night without a wait.

The not-so-good:
-- The flavor of my soy sauce ramen was just okay. It felt simple and not as complex and hearty as I&#39;d hope. The flavor imparted by the bell peppers was interesting... not really my preference, though.
-- The egg was cooked pretty well, but it was plain and didn&#39;t seem to be marinated the way other places do. You also have to pay to add the egg.
-- They weren&#39;t able to split the check... thank goodness for Venmo."

I thought it was so cool they were featured on Man Vs. Food, they even have the host&#39;s picture on the wall when you walk in so that&#39;s neat!  It&#39;s in an upstairs corner of Little Tokyo nestled in with some other Japanese restaurants and businesses that are a little separate from the main part of Little Tokyo (make sure you check out this area, there&#39;s some cool stuff besides just Orochon!)

Despite all of the hype, I found the ramen to be pretty average.  It&#39;s not a bad thing, it just wasn&#39;t the most unique of flavors to me personally.  If you&#39;re looking for spicy ramen though, this is probably going to be a heaven for you, as they have a range of spices all the way up to a challenge level!  But for the average ramen eater looking for a classic bowl of ramen, there&#39;s nothing about this place that would make me go there first before others.  

It&#39;s small but when it comes to these kinds of places, I think that&#39;s the atmosphere I prefer.  It really gives you the sense of eating at a little local place that has something special to offer.  The view, if you sit at the tables near the window or outside, is lovely!  Eating here is a great way to get a memorable Little Tokyo experience and if you&#39;re a casual fan of ramen, I think you&#39;ll be plenty satisfied with Orochon Ramen!"

It could be that I didn&#39;t like this style of ramen but it just didn&#39;t do anything for me. I was disappointed in the cut of meat in the ramen as well- again, it could be the style but I like juicy cuts of fatty pork belly--this was dried up, questionable meat.

Service was a bit slow, had to wait for a good while just to get another plate to share some fried rice.

He loved it, as I do!  I&#39;ve been there several times before (most recently in Jan 2015 before our March 2016 visit).  

As I&#39;ve described in previous reviews, Orochan is a no-frills restaurant where you choose your ramen base (miso, soy, etc) and also the spicy level (ranges from 1-7, with 1 being most spicy and 7 being least spicy, with a Special 1 and 2 as the spiciest levels). We had plans for later that day and didn&#39;t want to risk and upset stomach, so I got a relatively mild spicy version (spicy level 4, miso broth).  My hubby cannot tolerate spicy food so be got a non-spicy (not even on the spice chart) soy version.  

I sat inside (as opposed to on their patio) for the first time ever!  Service was decent.  Seriously, this place is no frills!  Very casual.  We got there at their opening time on a Sunday so we got seated quickly, but they do tend to fill up.  Toward the end of our meal, the restaurant was already packed.  Parking is a bit tough, but there are lots nearby.

I don&#39;t know what happened, but I swear their ramen used to be much better. I started coming here because I saw it on the food network. They have a ramen challenge.

The chasu is dry, and the broth isn&#39;t anything special. It really had no flavor! We ordered some fried rice that was pretty good. It came with pickled ginger on the side, and I decided to put some in my ramen. That was a great idea, so I asked for more.
The waiter went to ask the kitchen, who told him no. I don&#39;t know if the waiter assumed I was listening, but he never came back to let me know he wasn&#39;t bringing it.

After my recent visit, I realized they put bell peppers in the ramen. I couldn&#39;t tell if this was new? 
The ramen prices start around $9.50 and each topping is about $.90 and up.
The ramen comes with 2 small slices of meat, bean sprouts and bell peppers. Orochon&#39;s special is its spicy challenge. Numbers go from 7 to special 2. People who finish the special 2 bowl in under 30 minutes get to be on their wall of fame. 
I ordered the number 3 spicy miso ramen, and by adding more toppings, the prices accumulate. 
The broth was extremely salty.. I think I literally saw salt chunks floating in my bowl...

Big portions, big taste.
I like creamy fatty broth, but I also like a spicy miso broth that isn&#39;t creamy once in a while. 


Mind you all, it&#39;s a very cramped restaurant.  As much as I love orochon, I will say, they could really work on the little stuff. The nasty napkin holders outside- those are rusting, none of the tables outside are stable, the bathrooms are nasty, servers are often tactless. The manager is awkward. He seems like a super server who doesn&#39;t interact with customers. 

Normally, I look past all of these bc my mission is to satisfy my craving for some spicy ramen. 

Most recently, I ordered take out. I got home and the lid on the ramen had shattered from being too hot. More than half the broth had spilled out into the bag and in my car and the napkins had dunked themselves into the remaining contents. I don&#39;t know who stacks a box on top of a plastic paper thin lid of an overheated to-go container. I was annoyed bc I couldn&#39;t salvage the food.

The ramen itself is great, not creamy-fatty, but it&#39;s own garlicky spicy, but please let&#39;s work on the details of making every experience a wholly good one....! =\"

And I LOVE spicy soup. If you&#39;re extremely particular about &#34;good&#34; spicy like I am, you will enjoy Orochon&#39;s level of Spiciness. 

I always get the Orochon Spicy level 2  (Hyper) Soy Sauce Base Soup with extra Bean sprouts and Bamboo Saute. The Soy Sauce base soup is much more dense and clean than the Miso. I have also tried the miso numerous times (Which is also excellent) but the miso broth is much more heavy and filling compared to the lighter soy sauce soup. Both are really good but if you have never tried the Soy, please try it once. I have never looked back at miso once I tried the soy sauce base.

The parking lot is at the Yellow Weller Court Parking. These days it is really busy so you have to valet it with the valet men but, you pay on your way out. Orochon validates a bout a hour or two, make sure to show them your parking ticket when you pay to get the validation stickers!"

I see the place was full of people dining in and outside tables.  We end up getting a table for 5 seats inside.  

The menu is simple and the ramen base is between Miso, Soy Sauce and Salt.  Off course you gotta go with the original Miso; I didn&#39;t want it to be sweet or salty.  Miso Ramen (level 6 for me for I wanted no spicy but some spice flavor to it; ranges from 1-7 with 1 being most spicy and 7 being least spicy, with a Special 1 &amp; 2 as the spiciest levels) with a egg and extra meat is what I got.  I needed that extra kick on the protein from no breakfast and coming back from rock climbing.

This place isn&#39;t authentic ramen joint as I thought even though it came with some interesting toppings in my ramen.  Each bowl came with green onions, green peppers, bamboo saute, bean sprouts, black shredded mushrooms, and cha-shu pork slices.  The noodles didn&#39;t even taste that amazing to me, not the pork slices wasn&#39;t that tender as most other ramen places are.  Overall, with so much hope, it tasted okay for us and the food with the broth wasn&#39;t that amazing that would make me want to crave for it again or soon.  

The service was also slow, for the waiter forgot our drinks (Green Tea and Coke) and had to go looked it up.  Plus parking was hard to locate as well, which never effects my rating for the restaurant business anyway"

I&#39;ve lived in Japan and eaten ramen all over Japan and here in LA. I just don&#39;t understand why this place is popular...

I came here for the first time last week. I tried to come previously, but was met with crazy long wait times, forcing me to go to other Weller Court restaurants. This time, I was offered a seat in the cold on the balcony but eventually moved inside.

I tried the miso ramen, with medium spice (#4), based on the host&#39;s recommendations. I love spicy food, but holy crap this was spicy! Other than that, the broth was tasteless: it tasted like chicken dashi that had a whole box of shichimi dumped into it! I couldn&#39;t taste the miso or umami flavor at all! 

Despite the forgettable broth, I tried to enjoy the chashu and other accoutrements to the meal. The chashu was...terrible: overcooked and tough. There were no tender pork slices. It tasted like old stew meat/shoe leather. The egg was overcooked and flavorless. The only thing good about the meal really was the generous portion overall and a lot of vegetables added.

The service was also slow, lackadaisical, and unfriendly. Even with as busy as the famous ramen shops like Daikokuya and Shinsengumi are, the service at those places are much friendlier than Orochon. For the price, the wait, not so good ramen and the lack of service, I was an unhappy camper. I couldn&#39;t even finish the meal, and ramen is one of my favorites, so I hope this says a lot.

Here&#39;s the score:
Food: 1/5
Ambience: 1/5
Service: 1/5
Price: 2.5/5

Overall: 1.375/5. No Bueno. There&#39;s so much better ramen here in LA, so skip this one."

Unfortunately, I was not as impressed. Located in Little Tokyo, there&#39;s a lot of competition and with many other ramen options around, I would not recommend this place.

First off, you are offered one of three broths: salt, miso, or soy sauce. The one unique thing about Orochon is you are given the option to choose your spice level whereas most other ramen places have theirs set already. Because I&#39;m a huge fan of spice, this was nice but unfortunately, the broth didn&#39;t have much flavor or thickness to it.

The dish also comes with very limited toppings. It comes with black mushrooms, onions, bean sprouts, bamboo shoots and bell peppers, none of them of notable taste or uniqueness. The bamboo shoots and black mushrooms were extremely bland. I usually try not to compare restaurants, but after eating at Daikokuya, the taste and richness of these toppings couldn&#39;t compare. They also gave meat, but the meat was of very low quality. It was similar to thin cut pork that you can buy at any Asian oriental market with very little taste. I actually didn&#39;t even finish my meat because of how bland and dry it was. Adding an egg costs an additional $1 as well.

Service was not great either. My friend ordered 2 orders of extra noodles and they only brought out one. Later on, they brought out our receipt, charging us for 2 extra noodles even though we had only received one. We had to ask the waiters to refill our waters as well. 

Overall, I wasn&#39;t a fan. Definitely try your luck at a different ramen place if you&#39;re around the area."

I opted for the spiciest salt broth with extra meat and ramen, but it was not that spicy. My brother couldn&#39;t even finish his miso, and his girlfriend&#39;s soy ramen tasted like dish soap for some reason.

It&#39;s like I&#39;m eating a badly seasoned noodle dish in water instead of a well-crafted ramen broth.

Makes me mad thinking about this place, let alone writing about it.

If you crave ramen, please stay away from this place. Trust me, I know what good ramen is supposed to taste like.

When they are busy, they tend to forget orders, I witnessed it three times when I went there -- table sitting next to me, one of their orders forgotten and was waiting for it, the other side of me, same deal. Ended up just canceling their last order that never came.

I went with a large group so we just split up. The last order they missed was my friends&#39;, I guess since he was the only soy broth in the group they forgot his order and it arrived late.

However, I remember the last times I have been here, the ramen was so much tastier and I ordered the same medium spicy miso broth. That was pretty disappointing, but it wasn&#39;t super bad. I don&#39;t know what happened, they either changed the recipe or got a new cook. Also, the location is in an abandoned like strip mall with the bookstore and Marukai holding the business up.

It&#39;s a little hard to find because it&#39;s on the top floor of the Weller Plaza. I didn&#39;t even know there were any places to eat up there. So when you go, just take the elevator till it won&#39;t go any higher and look to your left. There it is!

It&#39;s got that funky hole in the wall vibe to it that I love. That alone sold me on the place. Plus, there&#39;s plenty of indoor and outdoor seating.

You can get your ramen as spicy as you want. I opted for level 5 miso. Pretty tame, but hot enough for me. A couple of my friends ordered the Special 1, which is one level below the hottest. Let&#39;s just say they later regretted that decision. &#39;Nuff said. You have been warned!

If I was in the mood for noodles in Little Tokyo, I think I&#39;d go here before some of the other places that are so crowded. Definitely worth checking out if you&#39;re downtown and want a little ramen...mild or super spicy...they&#39;ve got you covered and burned."

I recently went back and tried the spicy miso and was shocked at how flavorful, thick, and delicious it was. The shoyu ramen was as good as I had remembered,and hands down I still give my highest praises for their broth, which is full of depth and layers hat I can&#39;t explain.

This used to be my go-to spot for ramen. I moved to New York in 2013, and I swore up and down that nothing could touch Orochon. I tried many ramen places in NYC, and though I was satisfied, it didn&#39;t live up to the high standard that Orochon set. I came back to visit a few years ago, and I ate at Orochon again. It was still wonderful, and everything that I remembered. 

However, my love was dashed to pieces during my most recent visit. Again, what happened? I got my usual ramen, and I expected that it would taste the same. Needless to say, it did not. The broth tasted like dishwater. I ordered super super super spicy, and it wasn&#39;t spicy at all. Not to mention, it just felt dirtier than before. Also, an employee was getting yelled at by someone I&#39;m assuming is the manager. Obviously, they have no regard for the quality of the food or the customer experience. Sadly, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be making another trip to Orochon. It&#39;s unfortunate, but I can&#39;t continue to disappoint myself over and over again."

I love how simple the menu is as well. 3 types of ramen with all the spice levels! I got the Miso level 6 and it was delicious! My boyfriend got the Miso #2 and it was even better!

I spotted a German Brown Roach run between the backboard and the wood bench my girl was sitting on as we waited for our ramen, my order a #4 and my girl&#39;s a #2. My girl tried to give the restaurant a pass on account of it being Downtown and roaches are inevitable in any downtown structure but nah, I don&#39;t buy that--never did I expect to see one in a restaurant I&#39;ve heard such positive reviews about, as well as seeing featured on television. What I got for the roaches was basically lukewarm Campbell&#39;s chicken soup with pork scrapes, some vegetables, but a good amount of spice.
They at least have the spice down right. 

If not for the cockroach I would give this place a two, maybe even a three if my ramen was hot and not lukewarm. Oh yeah, the tables with the drawers of napkins and utensils is a nice touch. Too bad you&#39;re not coming here for the tables."

There&#39;s a large outdoor seating area and it&#39;s a bit confusing who your server is because it seems to be &#34;whoever sees your first will take your request&#34;... but then sometimes they aren&#39;t on the same page because they don&#39;t know who helped you already.

Regardless, the food came out fast. No long lines like Daikokuya. 

The ramen comes in a good hearty portion but the broth could use some work. I prefer Shinsengumi or even Daikokuya. 

I ordered the miso broth. Generous with the noodles and toppings. The pork that it comes with is NOT cha shu pork, so don&#39;t get confused. Items like eggs are 99cents more and extra noodles are $1.99.

A new item I haven&#39;t had in other ramen brothers - bell peppers. Can&#39;t say it helped or detracted, but was interesting.

My friend got the teriyaki chicken, which looks to be a much better option - huge plate of chicken, salad and a side of rice. Next time, i&#39;ll have to try that.

First impression is mall food. Server is pretty nice. But what?! I can&#39;t remove bell peppers and add more black mushroom without an additional charge?

Ordered the Miso Ramen and a side of gyoza and fried rice. Impatiently waiting for my food. 

Update 1: Gyoza came out, pretty simple plate - so far pretty standard. A little charred but all good.

Update 2: Overall, Ramen looked plain but it definitely had a kick. We had medium spicy and it was there. Nothing spectacular but it got the job done. The Hero of the order was definitely the fried rice!

As for the broth, not flavorful at all. Pork was just boiled, wasn&#39;t marinated or boiled in soy sauce. 

Can portion sizes and price make up for it?

NO!

Unfortunately, we couldn&#39;t all sit together at one table but we were seated near each other.

I ordered the #6 (you choose your spiciness level 1 is the spiciest and 7 is non spicy) with miso broth.  I was surprised when the bowl came at how large it was!  You get a lot of broth, noodles, char siu, and vegetables.  Despite this, I was able to finish the whole bowl and it left me feeling satisfied.  Another thing that surprised me was that the char siu was sliced up.  At other ramen establishments, they usually give you one large piece and you have nibble off pieces.  Having it sliced up made it easier to eat.

Normally, I&#39;m not a fan of spicy.  #6 was just right and you could see the bits of red seasoning but I couldn&#39;t really taste it.  The noodles were just right, they weren&#39;t too hard nor too soft.  I like my noodles somewhere in between.

Overall, this place was ok based the quality of the ramen.  I feel like people come here for the hype (since Adam Richman was here) or for the challenge. I&#39;ve had better tasting ramen elsewhere but I do have to say you get a lot for an $8 bowl of ramen (i&#39;m used to paying $10 for a small bowl).

I wasn&#39;t too familiar with the menu so I asked what certain things were and the staff was very helpful.  Apart from soup there are sides to choose from.

Because Little Tokyo is so dense with other ramen shops this place sits below average of the other places. I&#39;m reviewing this based mostly on the ramen. The actual shop is in a nice location on the third floor of the shopping mall. You get a decent view sitting outside on the walkway. The portion size you get for ramen is more then regular sized bowls in the area but that&#39;s the only positive I find for their ramen. 

The day I went I ordered the #4 miso ramen. After seeing the long wait list and full restaurant I had somewhat high expectations. Was I saddly disappointed, the ramen itself lacked the richness I come to expect when going to other ramen shops. I didn&#39;t think the broth and other ingredients meshed well together. It was somewhat watery for me and the vegetables, such as the bell peppers, stood alone. Not marrying well with everything else.

The menu is pretty simple and easy to follow. The bowls are HUGE. I like things pretty spicy and the number 2 was prefect (Not the special #2). They have a contest where you get on the wall if you eat the special #2 in 30 minutes. I have no idea how they do it because the soup came out HOT, not spicy hot, but temperature hot.

Like a year ago a friend and I rolled in there at 3:30pm on a weekday and just barely snagged seats without waiting. 

Anyway, Orochon is fine, and good, even, if you like spicy ramen. You can get it super spicy but it will cost you extra. I normally go for a 4. As for the broth, I prefer the miso broth over the soy sauce but have never tried the salt broth. I assume it&#39;s salty? We all got spice level 3 last time and were sweating it out. It actually isn&#39;t THAT spicy when you&#39;re eating noodles and stuff but it packs a punch when you&#39;re only slurping the broth. And after you&#39;re done with the noodles, the leftover broth at the bottom is way darker and spicier. You can really taste the spice granules and the chili oil fo sho. 

As for the toppings, the chashu pork slice is pretty fatty, none of us were fans. I&#39;d skip most of the toppings because they&#39;re not that great. Depending on what extras you get your ramen will run you about $10-15."

With that said, I caught a seat at their counter in front of their window which gives you a partial view of downtown city hall. I scanned their menu and totally appreciated how they created a step by step ordering menu. So, I ordered the soy sauce ramen level 5 (which was mild spicy) with extra meat and when this ginormous bowl came out I was floored and thought they had mistaken my ordered and quickly asked the person, &#34;You sure this is mine?&#34; hahahahahaha and the person assured me that this was my order.

So I am now face to face with this bowl of ramen and I&#39;m trying to strategically plan my attack. So I decide to sip on the broth, and it was sure level 5 mild spicy. So I begin my attack by creating a little rhythm of slurping the broth with my little white spoon, and with my chop sticks chowing down on the ramen, pork and mushrooms as I admire the skyline that&#39;s in front of me.  Slowly but surely the ginormous bowl shrinks only into broth and i&#39;m bummed because it was delicious and all gone, but then realized that I have found a new soup to look forward to on a chili night.

Overtime, I think the combination of discovering better ramen places and the decline in quality here has led to this.  The broth did not taste or looked very appetizing, while the pork slices were scarce.  Noodles were ok.  I think would I have been better off eating their Fried Rice which was ok as well.

The service is very impersonal and not attentive.  My party felt like we had to flag down our waiter, or someone to order, get water, get our check, etc.  Also, the bathroom is gross and smells funky.  People say you can get an idea of how clean a restaurant&#39;s kitchen is by looking at their bathroom which scared me after I came to that realization.  I wish I took a picture of it but there&#39;s a paper taped above the urinal about their Ramen Specials for Kids.  Why of all places is that there?!

Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love ramen that grades itself on the spicy meter (because I love spicy food), but if the broth (I picked the miso based one) is like the Dead Sea, I can&#39;t really enjoy it.

I ordered the miso based, #3 spicy level with extra egg and garlic. I know that I probably could go higher (a 2 or a 1) but if the broth is that salty, it&#39;s just not fun. This is disappointing since I&#39;d love to be one of the few women to go up on that wall of bravery.

I came within an hour of opening on a weekday so there was no wait at all. The service was prompt and courteous. I like the fact that I can have a large sized Asahi with my meal. The noodles were nice and chewy. I found their choice of veggies (green pepper, bean sprouts, bamboo shoots and black mushroom) a bit odd. Spinach holds up better in ramen broth because by the time you&#39;re halfway into the meal, the green pepper soaks up all of the liquid and becomes mush. I like the choice of having bamboo shoots instead of it being a mandatory part of the soup; sometimes it can be too overpowering as a flavor.

Anyway, I&#39;m glad I gave it a try, but I think I&#39;ll pass when it comes to future cravings of ramen."

Not to confused with a great time I had here. The service is like all Japanese service excellent, friendly and professional. The location is great. I didn&#39;t know this plaza has so many restaurants. Orochon Ramen is located on top of the building and has a great view at the City Hall.

The Miso Ramen Soup I had was really something I wouldn&#39;t order again at this place. It was super average and none of the flavors stuck in my head.

I would come back for the location and the service but the ramen wasn&#39;t good enough unfortunately."

*******************************************************************************************************************
Why oh why is there no ramen house that matches Daikokuya ?!?  This place is no different than most of the other ramen I have had in Little Tokyo.  Its an uninspired flavorless broth (in this case miso) with lots of SALT and large portions.   Its apparent that very little effort goes in make this very generic tasting broth. Is there anyone tasting it or adjusting the seasonings?     I didn&#39;t even finish my bowl I was so disappointed.  I give it a 3 stars instead of 2 because there was no line and the service was decent.  I must say I am generally disappointed this far with Little Tokyo in regards to ramen.  My search continues."

Not wanting to wait for Daikokuya, since there was already a wait at 5:30pm, I headed to Orochon after hearing some of my friends mention this place. 

Located on the 3rd floor of a shopping center, there were a bunch of tables on the patio and a couple inside the restaurant. For a party of two on an early-ish Sunday evening, we waited for about 15 minutes. We were seated inside and 2 water cups were on our table. CLEARLY the wait staff didn&#39;t really bother to clean/check the table before we were seated because one of the cups was about 1/4 full of water and there was remnants of food on the exterior of the cup. I suspected the cups of water were from the previous people that ate at the table. 

After getting new cups of water, we waited for about 10 minutes before someone noticed we haven&#39;t ordered yet and we were just sitting there. I ordered the miso ramen level 3 with an egg and excluded bell peppers (I&#39;m not a fan). The Level 3 was perfect for me and I really love spicy food. I can&#39;t imagine how spicy their highest level must be. Overall, the ramen was good, but the service was terrible. Probably won&#39;t be back."

I first visited Orochon Ramen back in 2012 and ALWAYS make sure to stop in every time I&#39;m in town! Anytime I crave ramen, I think Orochon. The bowls are large and you can build it up to your liking.

The bowls already come with large portions of meat, veggies, noodles, your choice of broth (mine is usually Miso), and choice of spiciness...all for only $8. You can add extras (at extra cost) into it if you&#39;d like but I&#39;ve always found that what is originally included is enough to fill me up (yes, I&#39;ve made my past mistakes of ordering more). 



The only cons I&#39;ve found to this place is how busy it gets during lunch/dinner time and finding parking.  I avoid the long lines by coming about 2-3 hours before closing and during the weekdays. Parking can be a little difficult to find (with it being Little Tokyo and all) but there&#39;s a public parking garage underneath the plaza that gives you direct access to the restaurant (just walk up the stairs). Yes, I know, no one wants to pay for parking but you&#39;ll definitely get your money&#39;s worth if you plan on walking around and shopping before or after you eat. There&#39;s also a Japanese market in the same plaza that I like to shop at anytime I eat at Orochon... if you&#39;re already there, why not check that place out too! ;)"

My friends say that daikokuya and shinsengumi are much better than orochon, but I think that they are fairly comparable! The noodles aren&#39;t as soft but broth flavor is solid!!

The wait can be long and the seating is cramped, so in that sense, it&#39;s not the best restaurant to go to. Parking can be pretty bad too because it&#39;s $2 every 15 minute up to $9. From my experience, Orochon will validate for an hour, so if you had to wait, you might have to pay for parking."

I ended up getting the soy sauce soup. A little too much soy sauce for my tasting in such a giant bowl, however the soup was not bad. I would take a few things out of it next time and would try a different soup base. I also added egg into my dish.. that helped tie in the flavor a little more I think. 

Will be back to try other soup combinations !!!"

We stopped by for a quick bite because we had an event to attend at 7, and it was one of the worst ideas ever.  The place wasn&#39;t busy, the inside was practically empty other than two or three other tables that were waiting for their checks.  We sat and watched people who came in after us get their food before us and started to wonder what took so long.  We didn&#39;t say anything until after 30 minutes rolled by because we didn&#39;t want to be rude.  Mind you, our waiter didn&#39;t even come check on us after he brought us our water.  We asked if everything was ok with our order, and he says, &#34;yeah, of course&#34; without really even going to check first.  He goes to check on our food and then we heard him say that our order was delivered to the wrong table to another server. He didn&#39;t come tell us what was going on, he just went about his business for another 10 minutes.  We called him over again to ask him what was going on, and that was when he finally told us our order was delivered to the table behind us.  He was pretty nonchalant about the situation and walked away quickly like he didn&#39;t want to deal with us.  Our food came shorty after.  We ordered two miso broth ramens and a half order of fried rice.  The fried rice never came. Our waiter was not apologetic about the situation at all.  Worst service EVER. The ramen was a little too salty and my noodles were undercooked.  Would not recommend this place."

Very small (which is like traditional ramen places in Japan so we did not mind) and they have added seating outside on their patio which was nice. I enjoyed looking out at the shops, reminded me of Tokyo.

Nice buzzer feature to call the waiter like places in Japan too.

Other than that, not very traditional. (Think bell peppers in the ramen!)

Ramen was ok- I got the Soy-sauce base and my boyfriend got the Salt. We both ordered a 5, on a scale of 1-7 (7 being non-spicy) and were a tiny bit disappointed to find the 5 had no spice to it. I would recommend at least a 3-4 if you want to taste the spicyness! The taste of the base soup was good, noodles a bit undercooked (but probably done that way intentionally as the noodles tend to keep cooking in the hot base soup)- overall it was decent. $9.25 a bowl and they get you on the adds on- Cha shu was super tasty but $1.50 extra a slice(very fatty pieces) and adding an egg or corn and other similar add ins were around $1.00 each. 

Would go there again for a quick lunch bite but not for dinner or on a date."

I don&#39;t know if he still works here but the short Japanese guy with tattoos on his arm. This guy need to behave better!! This is the first time for me to have felt offended and uncomfortable by a Japanese person working at a restaurant, grocery store, clinic or ANY businesses establishments!!!

We asked him if we could sit outside seating with 4 chairs(we were party of 2) since it wasn&#39;t crowded and all he had to do was to separate 2 tables, but he said &#34;sorry but you can&#39;t sit there. Come inside&#34; without explaining why we can&#39;t sit there. But I really didn&#39;t have any problems with him at this point.
When we were walking into the establishment, there was a party of 3 moving to a bigger table than the ones they were seated. As soon as he saw them moved, he raised his voice and said &#34;No you can&#39;t sit there, please please!!&#34; with a very irritated and upsetting face and sighed loud!! 
I was like wtf?! seriously??? Is that how you treat your customers?! Half the tables are empty! 
I felt so sorry for the people because they looked offended as if they did something wrong...:( 

A few customers came in after us that asked him if they can take a particular table, they were told by the same way!! So rude!!!

I&#39;m always proud of politeness of Japanese but this kind of exception can ruin the good image of Japanese people and their businesses so easily! I hate it!

I mean if that&#39;s a store policy that customers can&#39;t ask for specific seats, that&#39;s fine but notify customers by posting a notice on the window or something if he doesn&#39;t want to get asked!!! And before anything...stop being rude to customers or quit PERIOD!!

Okay, so their food... Their ramen is not like popular trendy Tonkotsu ramen style, more like homemade style I would say. 
Soup is light and not as rich as Tonkotsu ramen that  spots like Tsujita, Santoka or Daikokuya....serve.
I would recommend this spot if you prefer shoyu or shio ramen which soup is lighter and simpler. 
I still like their ramen though I&#39;m a big fan of Tonkotsu ramen. Portion is big! Their fried rice is tasty too.

Overall food is pretty good, nice location and view, I&#39;m just hoping that the rude server dude will correct his attitude or quit. Other workers are nice and helpful."

They are located on the top floor of the Marukai Market. They only validate for 1 hr which is incredibly impossible to get in and out from this plaza let alone the restaurant.

We called to see how long the wait was since we were 5 min away. We were told no wait. Low and behold we come 20 min wait grr! We both ordered the &#34;Miso Ramen&#34; since the name of the other is &#34;Salt Ramen&#34; that threw us off. When we got our bowls, I find that almost instantly when looking at the bowl it lacks depth of richness in color. The broth was very weak and watered down. Didn&#39;t taste like a pork based, rich, unctuous broth. Sadly so dissapointed. The noodles were cooked perfectly they are on the thicker side and had a nice chew. We enjoyed the wood ear mushroom and fermented bamboo shoot addition. The bell peppers were not necessary at all and gave the broth and off flavor. The chashu we added extra was thin, gristle  and chewy.  Where&#39;s the thick melt in your mouth chashu? This was just a billed to death peices of opaque pork.

Again, it is just ramen so it wasn&#39;t wow-worthy but the customer service was phenomenal! The menu is pretty easy to follow as it goes by steps of building your ramen bowl. 
Moreover, they&#39;ve got quite a variety of drinks to order and challenges for their customers. If you&#39;ve got the empty stomach that can finish both the soup and ramen with everything that&#39;s included you can definitely get your picture on the wall.

The miso broth was decent. I would choose spice level higher than #5. I definitely prefer legitimate char siu over these little cut pieces of pork (reminiscent of stir fry dishes).

Came here with kind of a large party (8 of us total plus baby) and waited about 40 minutes for a table. This place is pretty damn small, so we were able to use up about 3 tables in the corner outside, but unfortunately unable to sit together.

Now the food. I got the Miso broth with the level 3 spicy( the smaller the number, the hotter). They also have a spicey ramen challenge here that was featured on the Travel Channel, but I was catching a flight back home the next day and did not want to fight it on the plane (if you know what I mean). Honestly, I was pretty disappointed with how not-so-spicy the level 3 was. It sounded a lot more spicy than it was. Though, I opted for no bell pepper, because well, bell peppers have a VERY strong taste and would overpower the taste of the broth. It&#39;s probably just there for the spicy factor. Broth was alright. Nothing really stood out to me like &#34;omg we gotta come back next vacation&#34;, but I&#39;d probably come back and try the challenge for kicks. Noodles were cooked nicely and weren&#39;t too soggy or chewy. Bowls start at around $8 for a pretty good size bowl and you can always add extras. Definitely a plus for being budget friendly

Overall, if you can make it down (and find parking) in Little Tokyo, I&#39;d recommend it if you&#39;re looking for a cheap place to eat, but if you want to be adventurous, go for maybe a level 1 or even attempt the challenge"

Previously I&#39;d tried Santouka Ramen in Biei in Hokkaido and 朝風ラーメン in Asahikawa Airport in Hokkaido.  While I am not sure if they are authentic Hokkaido styled ramen and I actually think the Santouka in Biei is not that good, I think at least 朝風ラーメン is indeed very good (not to mention their real and extremely yummy crab topping in an very interesting presentation).

It might be just my personal taste.

I came here around 6 PM on a Saturday night right before a concert with one of my friends. We were seated right away, and our server was the sweetest! He was so nice and gave us great recommendations seeing that it was our first time there. My friend got the popular indian curry bowl, and I ordered the sf mission burrito. Both good dishes, but I would highly recommend the indian curry bowl. Both my friend and I fell in love with this place (the decor, the food, &amp; the wonderful staff).

Came here on a Friday night to load up on some #nomz before going to a concert nearby. At about 7PM the place was still relatively unbusy and parking in the shared lot wasn&#39;t difficult at all. If the weather outside is nice, dining on the patio provides a lovely ambiance! Throughout our meal, service was just alright.

The first thing my friend and I tried was the brussels sprouts small plate, which was DELICIOUS. The brussels sprouts were cooked until they&#39;re soft and were covered in a delicious maple miso sauce, it was absolutely incredible. The rest of the food I tried wasn&#39;t of the same caliber, though. The Smokin&#39; chilli bowl was a bit bland and the the crumbled jalapeño muffin was dry. The Decadent shake (coconut ice cream, almond milk, almond butter, cacao nibs, vanilla) was good, but not amazing. 

I arrived to Café Gratitude very excited and loved what I ate at first, but I left feeling a bit disappointed. I&#39;d probably only come back if I&#39;m in LA with a vegan friend or if I really wanted to go to a restaurant with a fair amount of healthier options."

I was convinced so easily, thinking that In the world there&#39;s many things work together like walking Grand Ave to work and shed pounds, raising chicken and getting eggs, cleaning the room and getting jewelry like this. So I grabbed poetry from the rack and focusing on reciting poem, spending time for an hour in the bathroom and but sometimes I was tardy at school. How practical his idea was. 

Now I see some practical idea in this restaurant. We can taste raw food and raw arts together. Located in the Arts District where every art is raw, wild, untamed, without the frame, the food is also really raw. Pizza, lasagna, noodles which I ordered yesterday were very raw as if I became a cow not a human. I usually have a theory to believe myself that the cow eat veggies and human eats meats. That&#39;s why I was reluctantly dragged to this restaurant like my father gave me poetry as I visited bathroom in the morning. But food was really delicious and I couldn&#39;t believe what I saw, very creative. I usually make salad with veggies but they seems to make whatever they want with veggies: veggie meats, kelp noodles, pizza with raw toppings. 

But one thing I want to say is that this time I didn&#39;t need any book to go to bathroom because I already visited three times in the morning."

But cafe gratitude was an exception. I got this very filling bowl with great flavors and textures from kimchi, carrots, quinoa, brown rice, sprouts and avocados.

Happy, helpful staff. Clean beautiful environment. The philosophy of Gratitude infused into the core beingness of the establishment. Quick service. Beautiful food. Delicious!

What I didn&#39;t love:
A bill for 74. for lunch for two, before tip.
The usage of &#39;ingredients&#39;, agave and refined sugars. 

I had a delicious green juice, a lovely macro bowl (with the hot, sweet sauce, on the side...didn&#39;t eat) however, my fatal error was having a &#39;restore&#39; adrenal tonic. 

The menu said it had ashwaganda, cordyceps and gynostemma; which are all most excellent Ayurvedic and Chinese herbs. My server said it was whipped up like a latte. It had a sweet, cinnamon, slightly Chinese herbal taste. It was too sweet and unfortunately I drank most of it. On the way out I checked the ingredient book and found that it had almond milk and 2 paragraphs of ingredients. 

I felt really weird after leaving and a little while later I got a sugar headache like I hadn&#39;t had in decades. 18 hours later I still have one. Looking at their online menu I see almond milk and raw honey listed. These weren&#39;t on the in house menu. Almond milk is usually loaded with evaporated cane juice, which, sorry, is white sugar.

I stopped eating refined sugar in 1978. I am very carefully about my diet. I eat no processed foods because of &#39;ingredients&#39;. The adrenal tonic blew out my adrenals!

I don&#39;t understand the fascination that vegans, in particular have with sugar...? Evaporated cane juice, coconut sugar and agave are all refined sugars and not a whole, food.  Agave is particularly insidious, as it is just a bad replacement for corn syrup. One of the worst &#34;foods&#34; on the planet.

So here I am the next day, still dealing with a terrible sugar headache. It is so disappointing. 

When I go to a vegetarian/vegan restaurant. I want and expect whole fruits and vegetables, not ingredients and refined sugars. If it wasn&#39;t for this flaw the Gratitude would be one of the finest restaurants in the country and deserving of 5+stars."

I also tried the one is Costa Mesa location and it was also very good (depending on what you order). I was in the mood for vegan and wanted to try the cafe in Downtown location. Especially since the pictures looked so pretty of the layout. We found street parking, but seems there was an actual parking lot as well haha. 

The inside is very pretty. White everywhere, rustic, clean, and chic. Pretty spacious inside and they also have a nice patio outside. The menu ranges from appetizers, bowls, entrees, wraps as well as smoothies and desserts. 

_Feliz ($9) Coconut ceviche tostada, black bean purée, coleslaw, roasted tomatillo sauce, avocado, cashew queso fresco. Comes in one good sized tostada. Pretty filling as it had lots of sauce. Pretty refreshing and great crisp flavors. The tostada was nicely crunchy, good even amount of toppings. I would share this as I was pretty full after eating one. 
_Comforted ($9) Roasted garnet yams, spicy cashew aioli or coconut mint chutney sauce. I love yams and sweet potatoes so this is always a safe bet. The yams were nicely baked and warm. The skin had a nice somewhat crisp texture, which I love. The sauce was a garlic aioli that was refreshing and elevated the flavors of the yam. If your not a huge fan of garlic, skip the sauce as the garlic flavor is a bit potent. 
_Humble ($16) Indian curry bowl, red lentil dal, spinach, roasted garnet yams,
coconut mint chutney, spicy tomato jam. This is pretty filling from the yams, brown rice and sauce. Pretty carb heavy but if you want something hearty, this is for you. You get a choice of brown rice, quinoa, or mix but I opted for brown rice only. Not that spicy but had a nice soft heat in the back. The spicy tomato jam was not that spicy and paired perfectly with the bowl. It added a bit of sweetness to the bowl and it was a perfect flavor combo. Lots of great curry flavor.
_Pasta Bolognese. This was the special and was not listed on the menu. My gf got this and it was amazing. It was hearty, and filling and for those that love pasta this is a great alternative. The pasta shells were cooked great, a bit al dente. The &#34;meat&#34; sauce really tasted like bolognese, you don&#39;t get the sense that it&#39;s vegan. The cheese crumble on top, reminded me a bit of feta in texture. Served in a cast iron pan. 

My gf and I only ate some of our entrees and took the rest home as we were pretty full from out appetizers. And sadly did not have room for dessert, which is RARE! I recommend sharing one appetizer that way you can try their dessert. Service is good."

In all seriousness, Cafe Gratitude is a trendy organic, vegan restaurant in the Arts district.  The restaurant itself is sleek and modern.  Food-wise prices are between $14 - $16 for most entrees.  Portions are ample and flavors are for the most part spot on.  We split a bunch of dishes and made it family-style.  

Seasonal special Kansha 3/5: ramen noodles were just so-so, veggies were fresh and pickled Kim chee was tasty

Local Salad (seasonal:asparagus, spinach, arugula, shaved fennel. grilled peaches, vegan cheese, and toasted coconut) 5/5: best dish by far! Balanced, full of flavor, lots of good crunch

Humble bowl (lentil curry) 4/5: spicy in a good way, delicious tomato chutney, a hearty, satisfying dish

Whole bowl (macrobiotic) 2/5: my least favorite dish, not sure I liked the kelp-looking seaweed, seasoning was off, mostly bland, forgettable dish 

Giving pizza (seasonal: roasted eggplant) 4/5: delicious crust, lovely tomato sauce, and yummy roasted pizza

My only complaint pertains to just how long it took for entrees to arrive at our table.  We waited for over 30 minutes for what was supposed to take the most time but ended up being the first dish to arrive.  Nearly 40 minutes for a salad, and bowls is just way too long for a work week lunch crowd.  When we placed our order, the restaurant was mostly empty. I can only imagine how long it would take if they were filled to capacity!  Our server was very friendly but once the food arrived, it took forever for her to check in on our table.  

Parking is located in the lot out front.  Cafe Gratitude validates 2 hrs.  

All in all, I&#39;d definitely return.  The food is tasty and good for you too!"

I&#39;m not really a research person - I&#39;m more spontaneous, so I didn&#39;t realize that Cafe Gratitude had such a healthy menu!  Vegan and Vegetarian options means that there&#39;s less eating guilt and less worry about lactose intolerance!  So...it&#39;s better for us!

We had some time for a quick snack so we headed here because this restaurant was on the DineLA list. There was a special for $27 or so, but we were running out of time. We had some challenges looking for parking in the LA Arts District, so we parked farther away, down the street.  The good thing is that parking was free. The disadvantage is that the walking time takes away from dining time... 

Luckily, smoothies are easy to consume. No wasting time on chewing. We were done quickly. We even had time to use the convenient restroom while our order was prepared. When it was delivered to us, mine didn&#39;t taste right. I didn&#39;t think I ordered anything with banana. Turns out that it was Craig&#39;s smoothie and he had mine!  Hahaha!  But Craig&#39;s &#34;INCREDIBLE&#34; smoothie was quite good, even though it contains kale (Craig doesn&#39;t eat veggies)!  A quick switch solved the problem!  My &#34;GRACE&#34; smoothie ($9) consisted of coconut meat, almond butter, dates, and vanilla bean - yum!  Even Tim&#39;s &#34;THRIVE&#34; tomato based soup was good!  Alana had the same smoothie as Craig (INCREDIBLE) - it was great!

I wouldn&#39;t mind returning and exploring more of the menu.  The service was very attentive and helpful.  The environment was so bright, spacious, new, and clean - I felt like I was in an interior design magazine ad!  The positive affirmations posted along the walls helped me to center myself and encourage my sense of Gratitude!"

I&#39;m addicted to Buckwheat everything right now, and their Buckwheat pancakes &#34;OPEN-HEARTED&#34; - dare I say it, Ok - I&#39;ll say it! Are better than the ones I whip up at home. They are so delish!!!!! The LIGHT is great, since I&#39;ve been off dairy since February their almond latte does not disappoint. 

I will say - they need to serve breakfast all day! 5 stars when they make that small tweak.

Service is great. Question of the Day is always thought provoking. Staff always friendly and warm welcoming.

I was loving the DYNAMIC before, if you know me you know I love Indian and samosas are a fav of mine but since I haven&#39;t been doing the gluten thing I pass on these now.

The desserts are amaze! Get the AWAKENING you will not be disappointed I could feast on slices of this for days!

Love this spot, and everything about it and since I&#39;m not 100% vegan and have been known to dabble with a hint of dairy, animal products and gluten every now again I couldn&#39;t careless about any of the bad press they&#39;ve been receiving lately. Farms with chickens and cows don&#39;t take away from the awesome dishes they&#39;ve got going here and the warm and compassionate energy they bring to LA and their customers. 

Lately, as shallow as it sounds (again, I don&#39;t care!) I&#39;d rather dine around people who are concerned with what they are nourishing their minds and bodies with - not around a bunch of fat out of shape people who are swallowing who knows what and don&#39;t give two shits about their body.

Contemporary and positive (we found it either cheesy or annoying) but I get that it&#39;s part of their pitch.

Drinks were ok, one tasted kind of like mouthwash. The banana bread was pretty good, the cinnamon roll was a nice try but just too heavy. Breakfast main courses-- the chia seed porridge looked pretty at least, although the toast in the avocado and tomato was overly hard and neither of the veggies/fruit was anything special.

A smoothie alone will set you back almost $10, not including tip. But the days of focusing on price over health are behind us, people. At least in this part of LA. Situated in the bustling, newly revamped part of the Arts District, this is a surprisingly comfortable little oasis in an otherwise still blossoming industrial setting, surrounded by warehouses and hole-in-the-wall shops that look nothing like what you would expect them to.

But enough wordiness. On to the food! 

If you&#39;ve been to any of the other Cafe Gratitude restaurants around LA, you already know to expect super unique and powerfully-healthy menu items with ingredients so exotic, you&#39;ve probably never heard of half of them before. (Like, what the heck is mucuna? And is it actually good for you?) Each dish on the menu is labeled with an affirmation appropriate to the nutritional benefits offered by that item. So, if you&#39;re eating an &#34;I Am Amazing,&#34; chances are it&#39;s going to make you feel amazing after eating it. Even the desserts are good for you... ish, and vary from cheesecakes to truffles.

The drinks also offer a nutritional punch and actually taste pretty darn good, provided you remind yourself that you&#39;re doing something good for your body. I&#39;m not going to lie, some of these superfoods are an acquired taste. Overall, they&#39;re still pretty yummy, though. And they even sell a wide range of healthy products that don&#39;t go in your mouth, but on your body, such as organic lip balm. If you&#39;re in too much of a hurry, they also sell a few packaged items ready to take on the go, as well as bottled beverages like kombucha and cold brew coffee.

And thankfully, angels that they are, they offer free parking to customers. So, parking tickets are no longer an excuse to not eat healthy!"

Food: 
My girlfriend and I shared the Brilliant - a coconut ceviche. This dish was excellent and had a great combination of flavor. The coconut and mango pieces provided a sweet texture, while the avocado and some bacon pieces blended in nicely. The tortilla chips were baked to perfection, except I wish it came with more tortilla chips. I personally ordered the committed - bbq portobello panini. I personally did not care for this sandwich. I feel like the bbq sauce overpowered the other ingredients of the sandwich. After my first slice I felt as if I was only eating BBQ sauce and bread. However, I enjoyed the garnet yams. It had a nice crispy layer on the outside, with a sweet and soft inside. My girlfriend ordered the Humble - Indian curry bowl. I thought this bowl was a lot better than my sandwich. One aspect of the bowl that caught my attention was the spicy tomato jam. It seasoned the dish very nicely and enjoyed the combination of sweet and spicy. It also added some color to the bowl.

Atmosphere:
I enjoyed the pretty marble tables and natural lighting. The natural lighting is always helpful in food photography. Cafe Gratitude has interior and patio seating. There were plenty of other people dining with us, so the noise level is nothing to be concerned over. 

Service: 
The service was what I expect from all full service restaurants. Nothing to highlight or constructively criticized. 

Parking: Cafe Gratitude does share a parking lot with other stores/shops/cafes so it is easy accessible. There is also street parking around the area and that is where we parked. Sorry, no information on that parking lot.

Not sure if I would come back, but I&#39;m willing to try another one of their bowls."

I had the eggplant panini and it was really nice. I added a pic of it, which I didn&#39;t think to take until I had finished the salad and ate half the panini. I highly recommend and I&#39;M NOT EVEN VEGAN. They&#39;ve got a cool theme - feels very California."

The breakfast was filling but doesnt leave you feeling too heavy. I love the cleanliness and the ambience. The service is great too. Also, theres a question of the day. Today&#39;s was- what makes you feel appreciated? The place makes you feel all around great. 

We ordered from the breakfast menu (served until 11 AM) 
Trusting- scramble with tempeh, seasonal veggies (zucchini, broc, green beans, cauliflower), mushrooms, avocado and 4 slices of toast.
    The toast is alittle on the rougher/coarser side but paired with the veggies and sauce, its good! 

Nourished- this is going to be my new favorite!! Sweet and savory! 4 pieces of french toast, coconut chips (I assume?), tempeh chorizo, and sauteed kale. And a side of maple syrup! Only downside was the tempeh was on the saltier side. 10/10 would rec though."

Eating at Cafè Gratítüde made me love my body. There are actually no accent marks in the name of the restaurant... but try to pronounce that and you might have yourself a tiny bit of fun. 

The menu changes depending on what&#39;s fresh and available for the season. If that doesn&#39;t tell you how fresh and quality focused the food is, then I have several other ideas of what will. This is a 100% organic plant-based experience. Yup, I know what you&#39;re thinking. Do they have cashew cheese?! Yes! They do!!! Why are we yelling?! I know what you&#39;re wondering now... What IS a cashew? We still don&#39;t have a scientific explanation for them; but thank you Thomas Jefferson for the discovery! 

Forgive me if this is what they always do. But when I visited this beautiful establishment their menu was themed around... &#34;I am-&#34; Whatever you order! That&#39;s what you are! So much fun! So naturally I got the HONEST sandwich. My new friend was BLISSFUL (a delicious blueberry smoothie), and my other friend was SLIGHTLY PSYCHOPATHIC, it&#39;s just a plate with chipotle sauce on it that you can smear around into shapes. 

The honest sandwich was very good. Sweet natural flavors with every tangy juicy bite. It&#39;s what Remy was talking about in the film &#39;Ratatouille&#39; when he&#39;s talking about flavor combinations blowing your mind. I&#39;m talking about the rat... In that film. Not the dish, ratatouille, yuck... vegetables. 

Our service was wonderful and the restaurant was clean and cozy. Parking can be a little difficult in this area but last I checked they validate for the nearby garage. The prices are what you might expect for organic vegan friendly food. As I&#39;m not a vegan I bit my lower lip at the notion of spending over twenty dollars on lunch, but I feel all things considered the price is worth it. And for all you &#34;true vegans&#34; out there, this is certainly a spot for you. And for all you &#34;vegan fakers&#34; out there I&#39;m sure I speak for all carnivores when I say, &#34;Huh? You don&#39;t eat what? You cheated on your diet this week? Oh... I don&#39;t... Uh...... I don&#39;t care. Why are you grabbing my arm? Why are you sweating?&#34;

5 stars! You can&#39;t go wrong here. Now I&#39;m going to Taco Bell to order the &#34;SLOWLY DYING.&#34;"

The interior is very cute, servers are friendly, and they offer free validation for 2 hrs - but the pros end there.

I went with a friend, who ordered the marguerite pizza ($16). It tasted good at first bite, when it was warm. After the first slice, I didn&#39;t want any more. She also got the blueberry water ($8). It had a hint of blueberries but tasted more like carbonated water with mint floating on top. 

I ordered the Southern Soul Food Sampler ($16). There was no saving grace with this one. I love vegetables, but I don&#39;t know what they did with the ingredients. Their menu says, &#34;red beans and dirty rice, blackened jerk tempeh, smashed maple yams spiced collards, coleslaw, jalapeño and macadamia cashew cheddar biscuit.&#34; That sounds so delicious, right? 

There was nothing appetizing about the dish. The maple with the yam did not go well together. I usually LOVE squash and sweet potatoes, but this was a let-down. The gluten-free biscuit also was rock hard- and flavorless. There was nothing buttery or reminiscent of the usual biscuit. The collards were also gross in texture and in taste. 

I would have preferred if they brought me the uncooked ingredients for me in a bowl. It was all too plain and flavorless to me. I don&#39;t think that vegan food should be this way. Maybe we ordered the wrong things on the menu, I don&#39;t understand the high recie. Needless to say, we will not be returning. We left the restaurant with a lot of the food uneaten. We packed it with us, but I honestly don&#39;t think I will be getting to it any time soon."

This was our first time visiting downtown LA. First thought is that it is extremely noisy...  We visited on a Sunday early in the afternoon for a late brunch... The restaurant was less than half full... And we needed earplugs. I am all into peace, love and understanding... But this was far from a peaceful meal... It&#39;s very LOUD. I hate to think what it&#39;d be like when it&#39;s busy. Secondly, service needs improvement... Food servers threw food at us without regard for who ordered what. I am very sorry to say that because I am a huge fan of the brand. Other than that... Food was good... Consistent with other locations. I&#39;ll stick to Venice and Larchmont."

Being a meat eater, and one of two guys actually dining here, I felt kind of out of place.  By the way, the other guy was my son.  It seems the women folks have gotten a clue that eating right goes a long way to being healthy, and so I got into my feminine side of thinking, and ordered what I thought would be a Mexican-style taco.  Little did I know, the food here tastes great without meat, and is equally delicious and filling; a man-size meal at that.  The wife had a burrito, and the son a sandwich which were equally good.  The only odd thing that happened was the wife ordered a concoction of different herbs and cayenne peppers, which really kicked her up a notch; I finished the rest..."

Food is outstanding (worth the price), but if I were a vegan, and Cafe Gratitude was my only option, I&#39;d be eating meat after a month because my bank account would be empty.  But anyway, time to stop being cheap and start getting down to the nitty-gritty of things.

FOOD
1) Ecstatic - Oven roasted brussels sprouts with maple miso glaze.  Holy cow (don&#39;t eat cows)!  This was so good!  We split the bowl up between 5 people...I wish I had the entire thing to myself.  The flavor was perfection and it helps that I am also a huge brussels sprouts lover.  I think it was roasted just right so that the smokey flavor along with the sauce made this dish unforgettable.  

2) I am creative menu - I picked Spinach/Quinoa/Garbanzo Beans/Garlic Tahini/ and Shredded Beets.  The sauce made a world of a difference.  All the other items were pretty much things I could&#39;ve gotten from...Ralphs.  I didn&#39;t get extra &#34;Essentials&#34; or any of the &#34;Premiums&#34;.  That would&#39;ve made my $12 bowl of salad into like...almost $18 for salad??  My creativity would&#39;ve cost me an arm and a leg!  But this was a good salad.  The ingredients were of good quality and the dressing was actually really good!  I saved some for the next day and it was still as good (not soggy).

AMBIENCE/SERVICE
Very clean, modern, and vegan hipster!  From the moment I walked in with my dirty gym clothes, I felt like I kind of belonged...but should&#39;ve showered.  The food came out quickly after we ordered and we were able to grab a waiter really easily.  This could be due to the fact that it was about 30 min. before closing.  

FINAL VERDICT
I&#39;d come back here again...maybe once every 2-3 months?  This place is not wallet friendly, but definitely worth indulging in if you&#39;re vegan or vegetarian who wants to treat yourself out!

Question of the Day was: What do you stand for?"

So Nadine, Alana and I ordered a smoothie/shake and Tim got the tomato base soup.

The food is great, the presentation was wonderful, and the atmosphere of the restaurant is great. Very well lit place too, awesome happy hour. 
Their happy hour menu has a few different eats, and either beer, wine, or mixed drinks. Everything on their happy hour menu is $6. Can&#39;t go wrong. 
I personally got a Belgian beer, and three dishes called the Brilliant, Community, and Honoring. Bunch of different flavors going on in each dish. 
The Brilliant was more or less a coconut ceviche dish...the Community was their take on a spinach artichoke dip (with options of either regular or gluten free bread), and then the Honoring was their Mediterranean dish with hummus, tabulah, olives, etc. 
You could tell everything is made in house, as everything is super fresh. I&#39;m not even vegan and I really enjoyed it here."

Let&#39;s start with the interior architecture. You come in, and the ambiance is the first thing that&#39;ll catch your attention. It&#39;s clean, modern, and aesthetically pleasing with their choice of lighting, accessory succulents, marble tables, and everything in between.

Their service is amazing. The servers are attentive and friendly; their smiles are contagious and they&#39;ll take the time to answer any questions you&#39;ll have about the menu. Our own waiter posed a question after we ordered - &#34;What inspires you?&#34; - which definitely added to the overall positive and optimistic vibe of the restaurant.

Next, the food. People are often skeptical of vegan food, thinking that such cuisine is &#34;too healthy&#34; to be tasteful or &#34;too small the portions&#34; to be filling enough. This was not the case with this café. They were generous with my order of the &#34;I Am... Awesome&#34;, which was an eggplant parmesian panini. They also served large portions for my friends&#39; orders of the mediterranean raw wrap (&#34;Happy&#34;) and raw lasagna (&#34;Fabulous&#34;).

Their banana bread was very moist and full of flavor. It was easy to consume hehe and I also ordered one of their smoothies -very refreshing.

If you are in a sandwich mood with a bit of a spicy kick, get the &#34;Yo Soy Fuerte.&#34; It&#39;s a Mexican torta with cilantro pumpkin seed pesto, which is to die for. I substituted the ciabatta for a gluten free bun; it was soft/fluffy, and not hard like a lot of other gluten free breads.

If you want a bowl, get the &#34;I am humble,&#34; which is an indian curry bowl. Honestly, it tastes like authentic Indian food. I get it with half rice and half quinoa because I can&#39;t decide between the two.

If you&#39;re here for breakfast, try the &#34;Yo soy supremo&#34; which is the breakfast burrito, but definitely get it to share because it&#39;s HUGE. Beyond HUGE.

Their lattes are great - but since this place is vegetarian/vegan, expect almond milk - if you aren&#39;t a fan of almond milk, you should opt out.

DineLA Lunch was $15 and you got to choose 2 items each and it came with a very nice refreshing drink each that we didn&#39;t know about so that was a plus!

ECSTATIC oven-roasted brussels sprouts - roasted brussels sprouts, maple-miso glaze: Best dish of the day hands down. 
The brussels sprouts were perfectly roasted with some parts very blackened and crispy and other very soft and tender. The flavor was amazing!

CELEBRATING two collard spring rolls - daikon and wakame filling, carrots, sunflower sprouts, avocado, japanese pickled vegetables, sesame wasabi and thai almond dipping sauce. 
Meh. Definitely not my cup of tea. The collard outside was a bit tough to chew but the inside was good. I wish the sesame wasabi dipping sauce was more pungent. 

HONEST tempeh reuben - thin sliced tempeh pastrami, spicy red sauerkraut, creamy cashew russian dressing, white cashew cheddar, whole grain maple mustard, gluten-free amaranth and millet bun, side of creamy coleslaw, pickled beets and scallions
I was very surprised but this one since it was incredible! The reubne was full of body and flavor! I definitely did not miss the meat on this one!!!

ACCEPTING sushi bowl - blackened tempeh, shredded kale, wakame, avocado, cucumber, scallions, cilantro, basil, sesame wasabi dressing, gomasio, sprouted probiotic brown rice or quinoa
I think they forgot the  blackened tempeh on our dish as it was just rice, avocado, cucumber and kale...Anyway not my favorite.

This was definitely my fault but I didn&#39;t enjoy my dish at all.

(The Food)

Had the &#34;Choose 2 items for $15 Lunch Dine LA Menu&#34;: 

-Celebrating (Two Collard Spring Rolls) - The Spring Rolls were really interesting because they were wrapped in collard. To me it was a little hard to eat just because it was hard... jam packed with veggies and a little too big for my mouth. I wasn&#39;t a big fan for the almond dipping sauce personally, but instead really fell in love with the sesame wasabi sauce. Overall the &#34;Celebrating&#34; tasted OKAY... I&#39;m not sure if I would really get it again.. it was a little bland.

-Honest (Gluten-Free Tempeh Reuben Sandwich) - Loved this sandwich! The colors really made the dish beautiful to look at. Im not sure what part of the sandwich it was but there was pieces that looked a lot like chicken slices, but it was made of veggies. Which I thought was super cool. (First time trying VEGAN food.) The flavors were nicely matched from tangy sauerkraut to creamy cashew which I really really enjoyed. 

(My Experience)
The exterior, interior of the entire restaurant was light, crisp and beautiful. I loved the &#34;gratitude&#34; theme and also the quotes on the plates of your dishes. The ascetics of the restaurant was lovely, good for taking pictures, very modern contemporary. The servers were polite and very informative on helping me choose my first vegan experience and took the time to explain the food properly which made my experience there more enjoyable because of their enthusiasm in their food. Will definitely be back to try some more items on their menu!"

First of all the location is great. Right in the center of the arts district in DTLA. Free 2 hour parking with validation. The inside of this place is super modern and hip. Total hipster ambiance. 

Staff... I can only base my review on the girl who helped me at the register. She also made my coffee. I asked her if she the cinnamon roll was gluten free and she rudely said &#34;yeah all of our pastries are gluten free&#34; like I&#39;m  supposed to know that. It was my first time there. :(
She was also very snobby to my friend when she asked if there was real bacon on the non dairy donut with &#34;maple bacon&#34; on top. She said &#34;no, we are a vegan/gluten free&#34; the way she said it made my friend feel &#34;dumb&#34; in her words. 

Our pastries were great though I can&#39;t complain there. My cinnamon roll was beyond amazing.  Considering it was vegan and gluten free I still enjoyed it very much. 

I also tried the flourless, non dairy, gluten free maple bacon donut. The bacon was actually made out of coconut. Surprisingly this was also very good.

To drink I had the light which is a latte with almond milk. First time having coffee with almond milk. Definitely a taste to acquire a crave for. 

Pricing is just like any other cafe. For a latte and pastry I paid around $10. Pretty good. 

There&#39;s also a wall full of overpriced merchandise. All the merchandise of course is organic, natural and eco friendly I guess. You know &#34;hipster approved&#34; ;) 

I&#39;ll probably be back to try more gluten free pastries. Oh yeah I also love all the words of motivation on the cups and boxes to go."

My friend and I came here for lunch during L.A. Restaurant Week ($15 dollars for 2 items off the RW menu) and fell in love with the food and the atmosphere. The restaurant is so welcoming; from the staff to the decor everything made you want to be there and the delicious food will have you coming back. 

We ordered off the RW menu and had:

I am... ECSTATIC: roasted brussel sprouts 
I am... CELEBRATING: collard greens spring rolls
I am... ACCEPTING: sushi bowl with tempeh 
I am... LOVELY: peach cobbler  

My favorite items were the ACCEPTING and the LOVELY. Cafe Grattiude&#39;s plant based sushi bowl was so flavorful and filling; they definietly got the sushi taste into the dish without the fish...crazy! Also it was my first introduction to tempeh and I LOVED it. The glutten-free peach cobbler was also so good... I especially appreciated the cashew based ice-cream since I am trying to stay away from dairy.  

So glad I was introduced to Cafe Gratitude during RW and will be back to try other food items!"

It&#39;s so great that it&#39;s guilty foods with a healthy twist. I got the Awesome (eggplant panini) and it was so delicious! It came with a cashew ricotta spread and you can&#39;t even tell that it&#39;s vegan! It&#39;s also super filling, we all had leftover food on our plates and had to force ourselves to eat it instead of letting it go to waste. 

Recommend: Awesome, Whole bowl, Yo Soy Fuerte, and the Humble Bowl. I don&#39;t think our table got anything we didn&#39;t like. 

It&#39;s also great that they give you two hours of parking with validation! And there is plenty of parking in the surrounding areas."

They won me over before I even arrived by offering a private parking lot with free validated 2 hour parking. Thank you for taking the stress out of parking in LA. 

The atmosphere and service were wonderful. The interior is decorated in an earthy/nature-y touch with large windows and a brightly lit room. There&#39;s plentiful seating and great vegan/vegetarian options on their menu. Our waitress also started my group of 3 with an adorable question of the day - &#34;Who do you love?&#34;

I ordered the Awesome (eggplant parmesan panini) that comes with a side of mixed green. It absolutely hit the spot. The eggplant was coated in crispy cornmeal and was soft (but not mushy) on the inside. The marinara was a great sauce to pair, and I loved the extra nutty kick from the arugula. The amaranth and millet bun was also extraordinary. Note that a lot of Yelp pictures show that the Awesome comes with a side of sweet potato fries - they changed their menu so it now comes with mixed greens instead (also delicious). Finally to those who don&#39;t think vegetarian food is filling, I have a huge appetite and even I was stuffed. 

Highly recommended!"

Worse, when a restaurant decides it&#39;s OK to charge $2 for an extra salad dressing when the menu actually reads a $1, that smacks of both &#34;arrogance&#34; and &#34;contempt&#34;.  The manager apologized &#34;we have some of the old menu&#39;s out&#34;, interpret that attitude as you wish.  Do I care about the measly dollars.... no.  Do I care about the principle, you better believe it.  I&#39;ve been there a few times, and at an average of $40 to $55 per head it&#39;s not cheap, especially if you add the desserts (which are not so great BTW).

As I write this i realize that the waitress must have played a major part in the extra charges, and i still tipped the frigging asswipe.
 
Cafe &#34;Gratitude&#34;, methinks not.  Cafe &#34;SCAM&#34; is more appropriate.
I&#39;ll be back coz I love the food.
Best advice:
CHECK YOUR ITEMIZED BILL AGAINST THE MENU"

The food remains incredible, but the service in DTLA is shitty. The greeter seemed bored and the server with dredloc braids wasn&#39;t terrible, but sort of tense and then circled the tip suggestion on my first receipt. I guess she assumed I couldn&#39;t read.There were a lot of servers standing around chitchatting and yet service was slow. There were barely any patrons in the restaurant. It seemed like they over-scheduled people for that shift, but then requests/food coming out took forever to get. I don&#39;t mind employees socializing when traffic is slow, but maybe not in such a visible locale? No one was super rude, but I&#39;m just use to going into the original location and seeing all the attentive and pleasant staff there-it always made me leave happier than I came (along with the food, of course). I&#39;m just glad there&#39;s multiple locations, because DTLA seemed a bit tacky and I would&#39;ve had to give up my love of Gratitude and go to Crossroads or SunCafe or something. . ."

The service is wonderful, especially the bar. Perla and everyone else behind the bar take great care of you. I came here with friends a couple of times so I can say the table service is great too. As far as food goes, the salads look bomb but since I&#39;m vegan I prefer go all out at places like this. My recommendation would have to be the Mucho Bowl--it is delicious, heathy and filling. All of the bowls are great, you get your choice of either rice, quinoa or a combination of both. I avoided the sandwiches because I&#39;m not a big fan of gluten substitutes (taste-wise) but my friend had the burger on a gluten-free bun and it was pretty tasty. The prices can be off-putting but you really do pay for a great experience here--they also let you sample things like soup so you know what you&#39;re getting into. Also, pretty sure even your friend that is the #1 hater of food pictures on Instagram will be hash tagging away here. Thanks, Cafe Gratitude! Miss you!"

The collard greens were great (but let&#39;s be real, my homemade greens are JUST as good), the blackened tempeh was just okay, the BBQ sauce was really tasty, my friend said my yams were really good (I hate yams), and the red beans and rice was pretty mushy and lacked flavor.  The jalapeño biscuit was dry and hard.  The saving grace of the meal was homemade hot sauce.  The IPA was fantastic, too!  I&#39;d definitely return and give this place another try.

The second time I cam here, I had a party of 20+ people.  It was a very nice beautiful ambient space to eat lunch.   personally think it was a very nice place, there is free parking within an hour or two with validation from the restaurant, and the food is organic and fresh, and pretty tasty.  Some food items are really good like their BLT sandwich and their drinks.  Their brussel sprouts i wanted to love but i think they are a little too mushy.  I think generally they handled the big party pretty well but most of my party complained that they didn&#39;t get to order and were hungry, got skipped over, food didn&#39;t come... but i get it, its a huge party.  But a lot of people complained that when they complained, the answer was its their fault they changed seats.  Again, i get it, but still wish it was a little better so my guests didn&#39;t feel disgruntled.

They all thought the food was pretty good though and more than 80% off this group are all meat eaters.  So that&#39;s a good sign. there was a few surprised guests who didn&#39;t read the invite and was like... oh!! its a VEGAN restaurant?!  darn it.  But they enjoyed it after all."

Beautiful decor &amp; larger space than the Larchmont location. Also, since it&#39;s newer, the servers here are more diligent about the &#34;affirmations&#34; (You are Humble! If you ordered the &#34;Humble&#34; and such.) 

I usually get the following but, you really can&#39;t go wrong with ANY dish at Cafe Gratitude: 

*DYNAMIC (yam cauliflower samosa chaat -- two whole wheat samosas, roasted garnet yam and cauliflower filling, kale, chana masala, tomato, housemade bengali garam masala, coconut mint chutney, spicy tomato jam): I love Samosas and I love Cafe Gratitude&#39;s version of it. I&#39;m amazed by how &#34;buttery&#34; the crust is - tastes baked as opposed t deep-fried. The samosas sit  sit on a bed of lentils so it&#39;s super filling! It is a tad spicy but love the kick. 

*PURE (asian kale &amp; sea vegetable salad -- shaved kale, avocado, sea palm, nori, cucumber,
carrots, cilantro, basil, green onions, teriyaki almonds, sesame wasabi and garlic tahini dressing): This salad is super refreshing - a little tangy with lots of flavor! 

*HUMBLE (indian curry bowl -- curried red lentil dal, spinach, roasted garnet yams,
coconut mint chutney, spicy tomato jam, chopped scallions, sprouted probiotic brown rice or quinoa): So hearty and tasty. Love the slight sweetness from the chutney/jam. I always get half brown rice, half quinoa! 

*SWEET housemade chocolate sampler 11(choose any three of our chocolate selection) - these rotate but I LOVE the Almond Butter Cup!! I&#39;ve also had the Chocolate Pistachio &amp; Brazil Nut Ganache. If you got a piece of chocolate alone, it&#39;s $5!! So 3 for $11 is obviously a better deal!"

I&#39;ve never had vegan meals before, so I had no expectations whatsoever, besides all the good reviews about this place. My bf and I weren&#39;t too hungry, so we only ordered a couple of items. The entrees were kind of pricey for the portions given.

pad thai kelp noodles ($14) : marinated with thai almond sauce, which was good. but not flavorful enough to compensate the no meat. 
ancient grain pizza ($7): happy hour size; i need my sausages !
light cafe latte ($5): bleh, shouldnt have went light...

In my opinion, the employees religiously following and using those names was just a little too forced. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love the whole positive mentality only thing they have going on, but that was just too much for me to handle.

The food itself was okay. I felt really healthy as I took each bite. And because they gave really generous portions, I ended up leaving really satisfied. I ordered the Humble which was a Indian curry dish made with butternut squash. Tasted okay but nothing memorable. The homemade hot sauce they had was perhaps the best part of the meal. 

The seemingly forced service coupled with the really high prices just made me feel like this place was a clever play for people&#39;s money."

The place feels very chilled and serene - so relaxing! It&#39;s in the same plaza as EdiBOLS, and it has a free parking lot (or you can street park for free too).

I got the ($15) AWESOME eggplant parmesan panini, which consists of an herb-cornmeal crusted eggplant, grilled gluten-free amaranth and millet bun, marinara sauce, cashew, ricotta, tomatoes, Brazilian nut, parmesan, arugula, basil with a side of mixed greens with balsamic vinaigrette.  I love how the eggplant itself tastes like a yummy, faux hamburger patty. It was thick and tender. The bun itself was soft and chewy, thank goodness not hard! Though I will say, this Panini is a bit messy with all the marinara sauce and so you&#39;ll be wiping your mouth a lot in between bites, lol! Overall, I dig this meal - I full and alert, and stayed fulled up until my 3:15pm work break, lol

I also got the ($9) BLESSED spritzer, which is homemade green lemonade consisting of kale, cucumber, celery, lemon, agave, sparkling water and mint. It was cool and refreshing, especially for a hot day in DTLA and best of all, it&#39;s a non-alcoholic version of a mojito, yay!

Service here is sweet and attentive, and they allow you to enjoy your meal without feeling rushed. I have eaten at the Larchmont location, but I didn&#39;t like the atmosphere over there. The staff is nice over there, but you do feel rushed. Over here, it&#39;s so serene and chilled. I rather come here from now on.

The presentation for the drink and food itself is gorgeous and of course, their infamous slogan - what are you grateful for? It was delicious and fulfilling. Usually, I&#39;m not a fan of vegan joint since I&#39;m a lil worried that I&#39;ll be hungry again. However, this place left me filled and happy, yay! Would I come back? You bet!"

The hubby &amp; I were over at the Container Yard and the Co-Op when we decided to grab a quick snack. We had desserts and drinks around 4pm, service was exceptional! I really enjoyed reading their menus, they had great selections. Too bad we had just gotten lunch a couple hours before stopping in, so desserts were a perfect choice at the time. Their salads and entrees sounded amazing! Even Yelp friends recommended a few dishes after I had just checked in. 

I searched through Yelp for a cafe and this popped up. I really wanted to stop in at the American Tea Room but this was a lot closer to where we were. I didn&#39;t really have any expectations going in, but everybody was hospitable. Our lady server checked up on us often and she even asked if either of us had any food allergies they needed to know before ordering. That&#39;s a plus. It&#39;s been a while since someone had asked me that before I can even warn them myself. 

Thankfully, CG has their own parking lot. We didn&#39;t have to drive around the Arts District and go mad crazy, LOL! Y&#39;all know how it is."

Urth Caffe was too busy as usual and parking was horrible. Figured, we&#39;d try something new and different. I&#39;m usually disappointed with most vegan restaurants but gambled on Café Gratitude. 

The interior is very appealing and homely. Interior is something you&#39;d find in a Pottery Barn catalog. The hostess and waitress here are friendly with a smile and look like they came from yoga class. All dishes here are made at the restaurant. 100% organic plant based food served here.There&#39;s no processed food. 

We came for a green tea latte and ice coffee. Both were pretty good. Latte is matcha powder, almond milk and honey. Wish the latte was served hotter. The iced coffee is cold brewed. For dessert, we tried the Irresistible Coconut Cream Pie. It&#39;s made of coconut custard, dark chocolate swirl, and a date crust. This dessert is raw and agave free. Not a bad dessert, not great either. Since it&#39;s vegan, it&#39;s better than average that I&#39;ve had before.  

Not a bad place to try if you want something healthy. Otherwise, go pig out somewhere else."

Our busboy was awesome, but our waitress was a snob. She asked us if we were aware that the food was vegan, as if we havent been vegetarian for over 4 years. I didnt like how she assumed things about us and our experiences. When I asked her questions about the menu, she responded in a snarky way. I know vegans can be self-entitled douches but you probably shouldn&#39;t promote that at your restaurant. We want to attract more followers to the lifestyle, not turn them off to it.

And a huge plus is that it offers free parking in its own lot! Not having to prowl for parking in LA is a definite plus in my book. 

The first think I noticed when I noticed Café Gratitude was its very modern-looking storefront. There are a ton of open windows as well as an outdoor patio area off to the side of the restaurant. Upon walking inside, I was taken away by the brightness and airiness of the restaurant itself. Everything was very pristine and white - very clean and precise - with tasteful decorations framing the restaurant. Imagine pretty much all white table and chair furniture with plants in the alcoves and white twinkling lights overhead. I would think just sitting in this place would give you brain power or would help get your creative juices flowing if you&#39;re using the free Wi-Fi to do some work. 

So Café Gratitude is an all vegan restaurant that uses only the best and freshest ingredients. At the top of the menu, it states &#34;I AM...&#34; and the menu names that follow are positive adjectives that really make you think as you order - at least it did for me. All of the food items were so colorful and pretty that I forgot I wasn&#39;t even eating any meat! 

&#34;I AM...&#34; 

Thriving: I took a few sips of their special cooked soup of the day. It was really warm and filling, but for $8, I probably wouldn&#39;t order it again. It wasn&#39;t that special to me. 

Fortified: I was convinced because of the sautéed vegetables! This is packed with market autumn veggies and your choice of rice or quinoa with your choice of sauce. I believe I picked the garlic tahini, which was recommended by our server. I loved this bowl! It had a lot of vegetables in it, and with the graininess of the quinoa, and the zing from the sauce, I thought it was amazing! 

Humble: My friends really liked this dish, and I could see why. It&#39;s an Indian curry bowl, but had no presence of meat whatsoever. Instead, there was lentil, spinach, yams, chutney, and rice or quinoa. Again, the sauce - sweet tamarind sauce - really brought the whole bowl together. It was really good!

Extraordinary: A house BLT that includes coconut bacon, romaine, tomato, avocado, and a chipotle cashew aioli with a side of spicy coleslaw. I liked the sandwich, but wasn&#39;t a big fan of it. I think the flavors weren&#39;t as bold as the Whole or Humble. 

Grateful: A community bowl in which Café Gratitude donates $1 for every bowl sold. It contains kale, black beans, garlic tahini sauce, and your choice of probiotic brown rice or quinoa. This was pretty tasty. If you like black beans, I think you&#39;ll be okay with this bowl. However, I preferred the Fortified because it had lots more vegetables inside. 

Hearty: Raw Hawaiian pizza with fresh pineapple, sun-dried tomatoes, olives, avocado, cashew mozzarella, onion sunflower crust, and more. (There are so many ingredients for each item!) I thought this was pretty good for a vegan pizza. Taste was there and I liked the toppings on top of the pizza. However, for $15, meh, I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d order it again. 

I also have heard great things about their pressed juices - $9 each, they better be good! They have a bakery section off to the side as well. My

tl;dr - A very good experience at my first vegan café! The service was good and our servers were friendly and engaging as they patiently waited for our party to order - giving us suggestions and answering all our questions. Food is quite pricey, so I would recommend going family style and sharing so you can taste as many dishes as you possibly can. I love the concept of Café Gratitude - each bowl asks &#34;What are you grateful for?&#34; which definitely reminds you to keep a positive mindset as you leave for your day."

Parking was easy (lot our front with free 2hr w/ validation), the decor is fresh and beautiful, and the food here amazes me. The menu has so many great options it is tough to choose, but I enjoyed the Whole Bowl (macrobiotic) with added avocado and tempeh. Amazing flavor combo and presentation. The drink menu is also impressive with a variety of juices, spritzers and wines. I tried the mojito with prosecco and loved it- very fresh tasting with a cucumber flavor. The outdoor patio is a nice place to sit here, and the staff is wonderful too."

This place had been on my list of places to try for forever!! Thank you, Caroline L. for initiating and for taking me here! At first, I was hesitant to try any of the dishes because they all sounded...too healthy. However, the recipes and ingredients used in our orders were extremely delicious and surely impressed us!!! The service was awesome, the restaurant is cute and trendy, and though the parking lot fills up fast, it&#39;s not tooo difficult finding parking on the street or getting a spot in the lot.

I&#39;m officially in love with Cafe Gratitude. The vibes, the food, atmosphere, and people... all together made for a great experience while dining here. 
First I&#39;ll start with how great the arts district is looking! And a lot of that has to do with cool restaurants like Cafe Gratitude that have really given it a face lift! 
Next, the menu and food. All of the dishes are named after affirmations, so you send them into the universe as you order (again, the vibes are on point).  The food is incredible. Light yet filling. Flavorful yet not overwhelming. I was also impressed with their large menu. Everything is made in house, so my hats off to the cooks in the back! My dishes were good, but I was actually very impressed by my boyfriends raw Hawaiian pizza. It was not at all what I expected, but my meat-eating boyfriend loved every bite so I think that speaks for itself. 
The decor is on point! I liked this place mostly because it had a very earthy, vegan feel but with an upscale, modern feel (very California). 
So overall, I can&#39;t wait to go back and explore more of their menu. I definitely have a new favorite vegan spot in DTLA!"

I&#39;m not a vegan. We walked in and sat down with our menus before we realized...  Omg where is the meat?! Lol
Since we were already there &amp; tight on time we dined. 

Food- so delicious. We didn&#39;t even miss the meat. Which says a lot.  I had the &#34;awesome&#34; (crusted egg plant panini). My whole dish was yummmay!!  Left feeling satisfied &amp; full. 

Venue- I loved the feel. It was so up beat and alive.  Also had out doors dining. Very roomy. The waitress was awesome. She explained everything and compared the dishes to meat dishes for us carnivores that were trying it for the first time. 

Parking- good. Free with validation

Price- approx $10-16 per dish
Everything was fresh and can taste the quality. Worth it!"

I find it funny that so many people in this town, who should by now have at least some passing experience with vegetarian or vegan food, ask me, &#34;Did you like it? Don&#39;t your prefer the real deal!?&#34; Sometimes yea, sometimes no, but I always go after great food and you can find it at Cafe Gratitude! 

The decor is cute and consistent with the decor and feel of the Venice location and has a great series of foods to meet your needs. Feel in the mood for bowls? They got those. Feeling like you need to eat your emotions? They have have comfort foods like burgers and Mac n cheese and desserts. I ordered the raw Hawaiian pizza, which was surprisingly good, filling yet light. That&#39;s something I have a hard time getting through my fellow omnivores heads: yeah there&#39;s no meat or cheese, but I often feel more satisfied and clean without the &#34;itis&#34;  that comes with the &#34;real deal&#34;. 

The only reasons I&#39;m not giving this place a solid 4 (which I think it deserves) is the service was infrequent, leaving me wondering: in a place this small with only a handful of tables taken up, where is our server!? Also they have a raw brownie sundae, that had on point ice cream but the after taste of the brownie was sour and bitter, ruining one of my favorite eating out pastimes."

The food is highly overpriced with incredibly small portions. I got the eggplant with pasta and it was a 4-5&#34; shallow bowl for $16 dollars. I ordered a flavored drink and there was no flavor at all--basically an expensive club soda. Our server was patronizing and not sincere in her service.

The place is really nice-looking: all light, bright and modern without being sterile. Definitely puts you in a &#34;gratitude&#34; state of mind. Our group was a mix of vegans, vegetarians and omnivores but we were all excited to try the food. All of their food items have code names like &#34;serene,&#34; &#34;honoring,&#34; &#34;courageous,&#34; etc, which is actually kind of annoying, especially when the servers only refer to your dish by its code name which you&#39;ve forgotten to memorize. We were still in time for happy hour so I got one of their $5 mojitos, which was quite refreshing and good. I got their &#34;Blue Plate Special,&#34; (don&#39;t ask me what the code name was) which is like a &#34;meat&#34;loaf plate, served with mashed potatoes with rich mushroom gravy, red cabbage slaw and steamed kale. I thought it was quite good. My bf got their &#34;sushi&#34; bowl, which turned out to be very simple and rather bland. Pretty much a kale and quinoa-based bowl with some seaweed and &#34;sushi&#34; pieces constructed with some nuts and stuff--meh. Overall I think everyone enjoyed their food but it certainly wasn&#39;t the most inventive or tasty vegan food. Places like Shojin or even Veggie Grill have tastier and more interesting food. But I guess this place is healthier--they don&#39;t have any fried stuff, as I recall. I know we were a big party but man it seemed like it took forEVER for the food to come out, and then another forEVER for the check (which they very graciously did a lot of splitting for us, so bonus points there). While it was mostly positive, the food wasn&#39;t so excellent I&#39;d seek it out as a destination. 

STEPH JUDGEMENT: Cool concept and ambiance but food was just OK and the service was slow."

Cafe Gratitude is a really hipster cafe in the Arts District. The inside is really clean and modern, and there is option of outdoor seating.
The menu has a lot of interesting options, and everything is organic and made in house. I tried the chicken Caesar wrap and the portion was huge and decent. The &#39;chicken&#39; was tempeh. I found the side salad underwhelming and underdressed. 
On the menu, I found the items with meat substitute all tempeh stuff. I wish there was tofu based options (some of my favorite vegan food is the chinese Buddhist vegetarian cuisine).
Menu is also very expensive for food without animal product but you are also paying for the area. (15 for my wrap)"

I knew this place was pricy. So why did I not know that you order in a very special/pretentious type of way? You see, instead of asking for the fake chicken sandwich like most vegan joints, each item is named after an affirmation. And when you order you don&#39;t say &#34;I want&#34; you simply say &#34;I am&#34; and the name of the dish. Here, this is what I ordered: I am Awesome. Yep, just like that. I. AM. AWESOME. The server agreed and then she brought me a vegan eggplant panini. I guess that&#39;s kinda cool but had I known this before agreeing to come here, I probably would have laughed, cursed the LA transplants, and respectfully declined the offer. Thankfully, I did not know and I came here anyway. Good thing because it was definitely an experience.. a very first world type of experience. And the food is really good."

There&#39;s the one in Venice &amp; another one in Larchmont. When this one opened I had to try it since it&#39;s the closest one to me. Parking isn&#39;t street parking. There&#39;s a decent sized lot with lots of parking for Cafe Gratitude diners. I love how it&#39;s not street parking which is rare for LA. Also, it&#39;s free parking too which is another bonus :)

Going in, there&#39;s always a server that&#39;s ready to seat you whenever you want. There&#39;s outdoor seating as well as indoor. I&#39;ve been here twice and I always sat indoors. The seating is super cute and hipster. The tables, chairs, decor &amp; interior design of this place is on point. They give napkin towels, which makes it a bit more fancy. The water jug is also super cute! 

Macrobiotic Bowl - $15 
This is really really delicious. It&#39;s a big bowl filled with veggies, kimchi, black beans, sweet potatoes, sprouts, toasted almonds, quinoa/rice and your choice of dressing. It&#39;s so delicious and filling! Lots of veggies in this bowl. So healthy &amp; yummy! 

Food - I love all the options on this menu. It&#39;s a great place for vegetarians and those who are trying to eat clean (which is me). It may not be the ideal place for body builders or guys because there&#39;s no meat. It&#39;s a place for girls who like to eat brunch &amp; catch up on a nice afternoon or morning! There&#39;s also a to-go counter where you can buy pastries, donuts or other sweets to go! They all look so delicious. You might need to buy some to go if you went to take a look. 

Seating - Many tables for 2 and 4 available. There&#39;s also larger tables for groups and families. Round tables for 6-8 and long tables for 10-12 people as well. There&#39;s also a bar on the right side of the restaurant when you enter through the doors.

Ambiance/decor - all just perfect. TOO CUTE. The bowls and plates are also super cute because it says &#34;What are you grateful for?&#34; on the sides of the bottom of the plate/bowl. The windows also say things like &#34;I am grateful, I am compassionate, I am ... etc&#34;.

Price - The price might be on the higher end but the quality &amp; selection of the food proves that it&#39;s worth it!

This is my favorite brunch place in LA so far!"

First off, seriously the DineLA menu is FILLING. This is not one of those places where they give you small servings at all! My friend and I each finished one appetizer, boxed the entree, had dessert, and finished our 1 drink each and we were *stuffed to the brim* with food and lunch for tomorrow!

Since you get a choice of 2 for each set, I recommend that you bring a friend so you can order the whole DineLA menu and share! Everything was super delicious, but let me break down some of the things that I loved:

-I am confident: Loved this whole thing. The cauliflower steak was just the perfect amount of cooked, with still some crunch to it, and the sun-dried tomato and  olive tapenade was so flavorful!
-I am present: Do savor that golden balsamic reduction on the salad; it is exquisite! Just the right amount of sweet and tart!
-I am devoted: Take a good spoonful of that shiitake gravy with your lentil and butternut squash loaf because it is good.
-I am warm-hearted: The flavors in this polenta are all around yum -- all at once light and creamy. I say you don&#39;t need to order the extra basil hempseed pesto because it is so complete without it, but if you do, it&#39;s still super heavenly.
-I am sensational: This. This right here was just *bomb*. Warm and gooey on the inside and crunchy and chewy on the edges. And what is that familiar and yet elusive taste? It was like caramel-banana-coconut-cream of corn?? Just absolutely, downright delicious. That&#39;s all you need to know, just definitely order it!
-I am surrendering: *Very* decadent. So much deep chocolate/cacao, espresso taste. Good, but I do think the brownie definitely over-powered the cashew ice cream, which was oh-so-light.

This was *so* worth DineLA, and I&#39;m definitely coming back even when it&#39;s not!

Service was excellent. I&#39;ve been to the Berkeley branch (now closed--so sad!) and this is definitely more luxe than its NorCal version, but I like it! Love the vibe and how they have those thought-provoking questions of the day.

Our server never asked us the question of the day, but that&#39;s okay, I just wanted to EAT. We ordered the Whole bowl and Hearty pizza (Hawaiian style) with a side of yams. I thought it wasn&#39;t going to be enough to feed two, but boy was I stuffed! The Whole bowl is quite filling, and even though a friend and I had shared all the dishes, we were both stuffed and couldn&#39;t even order dessert.

Yes.  It&#39;s that good!  You know how you get something one time and you think, Wow!  That was great!  You go back and get the meal again and you think, I must&#39;ve been really hungry last time to think this was that good.

Well, I just went back today to Cafe Gratitude and got their I Am Magical meal for the second time, and I kid you not, it was even better than the first time I had it.  Here&#39;s what&#39;s in it:

Housemade double cheeseburger with two black bean patties, grilled gluten-free amaranth and millet bun, shredded romaine, tomato, pickles, onion, spicy cashew thousand island, cashew macadamia cheddar, chipotle ketchup and a side of roasted garnet yams. (My sandwich also had avocado.)

All kinds of yum!  The portions are generous and it is quite filling.  I only had half of my meal.  I&#39;ll have the rest later!  Something to look forward too :)  

The yams were just the right amount of sweet and soft inside and out.  I&#39;m not much on eating the skin but I&#39;ll tell you, this skin was just as good as the rest of the yam.  Some of it had a sweet caramelized crunch, the rest practically melted in my mouth.  They got this right!  

As a topper, I got the I Am Vivacious baked kale chips with garlic tahini dipping sauce.  It&#39;s so packed full of flavor, it could be a meal in itself to me.  I could only nibble on a few of these. 

I must add that the people who work there are super friendly and helpful.  I will be returning to try more items on their menu.  I highly recommend this place."

Well, if you had to ask me, I&#39;d say that the delay was in large part due to the fact that I may have been living in a state of denial, refusing to admit to the crunchy-granola-ness of my preferences. I just didn&#39;t want to be placed into the I-eat-at-Cafe-Gratitude-and-I-love-it box. I refused to fit yet another LA stereotype. With that being said, I ate at Cafe Gratitude, and unfortunately, I loved it.

I went with a dear friend for lunch on a Friday, and naturally, as hangry girls tend to do, we ordered up a storm. Though everything sounded beyond appetizing, we reassured ourselves that this would be the first of many visits, and narrowed down our choices to Pure (the Asian, kale, and sea vegetable salad), Humble (the Indian curry bowl), and celebrating (the collard spring rolls).

The collard spring rolls were the first to arrive and let me just say that these little babies were redefining what it meant to be &#34;fresh to death&#34;. The avocado, daikon, and pickled filling provided such a beautiful contrast of flavors and textures. And the dipping sauces... UMF! The almond dipping sauces was the most beautiful raw and vegan ode to Asia. YASSS! Yes my little raw vegan burrito--yes.

Next up? The kale and sea vegetable salad with the sesame wasabi and garlic tahini dressing. What an absolute treat! I consider myself a textural snob, and thanks to the assortment of sea vegetables, this salad definitely didn&#39;t disappoint. And don&#39;t you even dare think that I forgot about the teriyaki almonds.. Fantastic flavors and textures--it makes for a great accompanying dish, but as a main entree, it&#39;s a bit too light for my hangry tastes.

The Indian curry bowl was by far the heaviest and most fulfilling of the three dishes. Now, I&#39;m not usually the biggest fan of grain bowls... Only because rather than focus on each individual component of the bowl, most joints rely on the grain bowl concept as a whole to do the selling. This usually results in underwhelming components, and ultimately a satisfactory rather than stellar end product. The humble bowl was the grain bowl exception with the rather contradictory name--the bowl and its flavors were anything but humble. It was such an absolute flavor bomb with the tomato jam and mint chutney definitely stealing the show. Heavy and as hearty as plant-based vegan could and should ever get.

I&#39;ll beat you to the punch and say what you&#39;re all thinking, and I could care less. With food this fantastic, I&#39;ll own up to any and every LA stereotype in the book. I have no shame. Take note world--I eat at Cafe Gratitude (and I hope to continue to) and I love it."

After she left, I sat at the bar and both young man , not sure if they were bartenders but they greeted me and also explained the menu. Kept checking up on me constantly . I really appreciate their time and patience being a busy morning. 

Food: didn&#39;t quite had anything to eat but I did had the cholocolate mocha cheesecake and it was amazing ! 
Rich in flavor and really well structured. 

Drinks: Amazing !!!! I had the chamomile leaf tea .It was served in  a leaf detainer/drainer. Very healthy ,,perfect temperature and well blended with Agave.

The entire concept of love and sensibility really drew me in. Next to Native foods, CG has a solid place in my heart for delicious vegan food. They have this creative mantra of ordering by starting with &#34;I AM&#34;... [insert name of dish].

Today, 
I AM... Whole (bowl):  warm, nutty, and hearty braised butternut squash, seasoned sauteed greens, housemade kimchee, black sesame seed gomasio, garlic-tahini sauce, terriyaki almonds, sunflower sprouts, and quinoa. Also known as the macrobiotic bowl.

One may believe 15 is a hefty price for a bowl of veggies, and although I agree, I also relish the fact that I and my girls were completely full (spiritually and physically). Eating clean and feeling satiated is surely an enlightening and enjoyable experience. This content delightfulness may be a placebo effect, but It&#39;s one I&#39;d willingly accept. Thanks CG for making my girls&#39; day brighter, balanced, and full of gratitude!

Food for thought with Cafe Gratitude&#39;s awesome vision on clean eating:
&#34;Eating clean is easy and furthermore, is a tangible and enjoyable lifestyle that promotes one&#39;s vitality, health and well-being. It restores both the mind and body not only through what we consume, but through love, acceptance, gratitude, worth, creation, abundance and generosity.&#34;"

The sweet potato and I biscuit was so good I thought  it was desser. I&#39;ll be back

Chipotle styled bibimbap where you pick and choose 6 toppings and brown v white rice. They have an egg if you want it but I omitted it because I&#39;m vegan. Their tofu is really well marinated and I love their cucumber and bean sprouts! They add a sesame oil dressing if you ask for it and it&#39;s delicious.

My friend got their kpop bowl? It was rice, cheese and meat with kimchi and a sauce...he loved it haha

Limited seats with just a few chairs inside and a couple patio seats outside, Gogi shows it clear that it is an on-the-go dining place. The storefront features a big bold green-and-orange name, a couple of umbrellas and modern brick design. Inside, Gogi utilizes the use of glass, clear white and orange furniture to make the space look bigger than it actually is. The restaurant also displays its menu on three 32-inch screens, creating a modern and casual vibe.

Gogi&#39;s menu has been changing all the time. On our visit, we were particularly fond with the simple yet inclusive food choices. Each dish comes with 1 or 2 protein choices, such as chicken bulgogi, spicy chicken, spicy pork, organic tofu, beef bulgogi, and k.f.c (Korean fried chicken). Apart from the Pork Cutlet Curry, which has a reserved set of side dish, dinners can choose up to 6 side dish for all other dishes. Side dishes include kimchi, sweet corn, carrot, edamame, broccoli, bean sprout, kale salad, cole slaw, spicy cucumber, and macaroni salad

Stacked Bowl: is excellent for the portion. It comes with two choices of protein. Having an adventurous mind, we set for beef bulgogi and chicken bulgogi. The chicken tastes just average while the beef is pretty good. One downside is they were a bit overcooked. However, other ingredients seem to compensate for the meats. We loved the chapchae; it is tasty and well-balanced sweet and savory. The dish will taste a lot better with the Gogi hot sauce

Bibimbap: runs for $7.20 for one choice of protein and a sunny side up egg. Our spicy pork Bibimbap was really delicious. The well-marinated pork is a little spicy, sweet and has the fragrance of grilled meat. The dish came with edamame, bean sprout, kale salad, kimchi, cole slaw, carrot, which in my opinion is fantastic. It&#39;s a flavor bomb: the saltiness of kimchi, the crispiness of carrot and edamame, and an authentic taste of Korean bean sprout. In addition, mixing a little of Korean chili paste to enhance the flavor is unquestionable if spiciness is your thing.

Pork Cutlet Curry: appears to be a seasonal dish that happens to be available when we were stopping by earlier in May. Since it&#39;s not an original Korean dish we don&#39;t expect much at all. However, the pork cutlet turns out to be really crispy. The curry sauce is good but not outstanding. They bring the color game up a notch with beautiful sprinkle of corn, edamame and pickled ginger. The shredded cheese melting on top reminds us of the infamous Korean dish - Chicken Buldak.

Drinks aren&#39;t what we&#39;d like to recommend. My matcha slush with boba tasted plain as if they only blended me ice and a few spoons of premade matcha milk powder. The boba is nowhere close to chewy. It was instead dense.

The ice-cream macaron, on the other hand, is very impressive. This bite-sized almond-meringue cookie is delicate on the outside, while the ice-cream filling is sweet, creamy and chilly. It&#39;s amazing how the macaron is stored at a low degree to keep the ice-cream cold enough, but at the same time the crust is not frozen. Once you start your first bite, you can&#39;t resist but ask for just one. More. Bite.

I ordered the Stacked Bowl with Beef Bulgogi, barbecue pork, brown rice, and 2x kimchi, macaroni salad, 2x bean sprouts and sweet corn as the sides. The sides looked really unappealing. I was really excited for the bean sprouts because normally I love bean sprouts, but I was so disappointed because they tasted like sanitizer or Sharpie markers. There was a chemical odor to the bean sprouts that made me wonder how long they had been left to sit. The kimchi was like a 3/5 and the rest of the sides were like eh. 

The beef was pretty good. I like the sweet/salty bulgogi taste. I was really disappointed with the pork, which seemed to be spicy just for the sake of being spicy. It was also really dry. I normally just tolerate bad food, but I didn&#39;t want to eat it.

Food aside, the service at this place was sad. The girls behind the counter had no livelihood in them. Though they greeted me with a very indifferent &#34;Hi, welcome&#34; I felt like I wasn&#39;t really welcome, but more than that, like they really did not want to be there, which I can understand, but it makes for awkward, negatively-impactful service. 

tl;dr -- disappointing food, disappointing service."

Well that&#39;s embarrassing, although I&#39;ve lived above it&#39;s establishment for 2 years. So in 20 some months I&#39;ve only come here 14 times, that&#39;s not bad, yeah? 

Park in the Tuscany guest parking (45 min free w/validation) if you&#39;re coming here specifically for food, or if you&#39;re here for the day park in one of the parking structures and walk on over! Otherwise attempt street parking on Flower or Fig, but good luck...

The place is small, but they share a lot of outdoor space with Chipotle, so you can sit there or go over to Coffee Bean and eat outside in their area as well. 

I mix it up between the stacked bowl and getting a burrito. Both are filling in my opinion, and they&#39;ve somewhat recently changed the recipe! They&#39;ve added japchae instead of having a more mexican mix with cilantro/lettuce/tomatoes. So in love with the new change. It&#39;s definitely got a more korean feel now.

Beef bulgogi is an additional 50 cents and has been for awhile. Unfortunate, but I shell it out because I&#39;m a beef person more than chicken for korean food. 

Boba is adequate, certainly better than Cup o&#39; Joy down near 28th area on Fig. It&#39;s not the best, but for me it&#39;s a big cup with a lot of liquid in it, so if I&#39;m feeling really deserving I dish out for a boba. 

Entrees: about 8-9 dollars 
Boba: 3.50 

It&#39;s not the cheapest lunch, hence me not coming here often but it does hit the spot when you want some quick korean food in the area! 14 dollars is a bit pricey for me, but I fork it over because that&#39;s two entrees for me. So technically I&#39;m paying 7 bucks a meal! That&#39;s more acceptable. 

Try to avoid lunch rushes, when this place gets busy it&#39;s difficult to move around inside because it is SO small. Summer isn&#39;t so bad, but normal school year--Yikes!"

For about 8-9 dollars, you get rice, meat (2 choices) and 6 sides. It ultimately fulfilled my needs that I dont really want to eat vegetables but I kinda have to for good.

Today I had a stacked bowl of brown rice and glass noodle, with spicy pork and beef, with sides of corn, broccoli, kimchi,  cole slaw, potato salad and sprout. To be honestly, the taste is not at all near 5-star Korean food. However, they had their own advantages:
1, Multiple choices. they had 5 main dish choices such as stacked bowl and wrap, 5 meat choices and 10+ sides. Therefore, people wont get tired of what they are getting. 
2, Fair price and great portion. Compared to on-campus dining, 8-9 might be a little much. The taste is definitely better so that I think all the baller businees students would not mind this price for a quick lunch. Additionally, you get a huge bowl with a tray of 6 sides, which is definitely enough for a normal adult.

I hope that Berkeley will eventually have something similar near campus for students to grab a good/quick/easy lunch!"

I was lucky enough to beat the lunch rush &amp; walked right up to the front to order. I got the Beef Bulgogi Bibimbop with Brown Rice, Kimchi, Spicy Cucumber, Fried Egg, etc. They had some of the traditional Korean side items, but also some Americanized options like Macaroni Salad. They have a few sauce options, but I didn&#39;t really like any of them as much. I also ordered a Boba drink, but it wasn&#39;t that great. I will say it is a bit pricey, but decent portion size. They have some indoor seating &amp; also outdoor seating. Parking can be tough, but you can be lucky &amp; find metered parking in front or the side streets. 

I just really enjoyed this spot because it&#39;s quick &amp; easy without having to go to a sit-down Korean restaurant or waiting for long to-go orders. I would definitely recommend this place to Korean food newbies &amp; people who enjoy basic traditional/non-traditional Korean food."

The biggest one being that they&#39;ve gotten much much smaller portions for their bibimbap (mix). Instead of the big bowl they used to serve the bibimbap in, the bibimbap now arrives in a shallow plastic dish. They used to give you a heaping scoop of each of the 6 sides you choose for the mixed bowl, but now it&#39;s barely a scoop. Instead of fluffy rice, my brown rice was hard and crunchy (like the kind that you scrape from the bottom of a rice pot or hot stone bowl). 

The only positive change that I can give is that they give egg on top of the bowl now. (And I am a supporter of fried eggs on EVERYTHING) However, the egg was pretty overcooked, with basically no runny yolk left. So sad. 

Sad to say, but Gogi has downgraded in both their size and quality of food, and would not be my go-to spot for Korean food anymore."

If you&#39;re hungry- you&#39;ve come to right place. The portions are big- especially for the stacked bowl. It comes with jap chae noodles, rice (brown rice is an option too) and your choice of meat- Korean Fried Chicken (KFC), chicken bulgogi, spicy pork bulgogi, and beef bulgogi. The stacked bowl allows you to pick five different add ons from a large bar of different items like bean sprouts, broccoli, potato salad, and carrots. Comes with different sauces as well- I like the spicy sauce and the aioli the most. The best thing is I don&#39;t feel so bad after eating this- the nice balance of veggies and healthy options like brown rice allows for this.

Their boba is good- its better than what you can get in the area. had to knock off a star for- raw boba that I got once. I&#39;ve never had that happen ever before... I give the benefit of the doubt- but they should do some more research in their boba making- they&#39;re a bit plan. The milk tea is good though.

There&#39;s guest parking, but its only free for the first 45 minutes. Get in and get out, otherwise you&#39;re going to be paying some big bucks. There is street parking, but you&#39;re almost never going to find any spots. 

The restaurant itself is more of a pick up and go type of place even though there are some seats inside and outside.

This is one of the better options around the area- will be coming back again haha."

It&#39;s a subway style Korean bowl. You pick a style whether it&#39;s stacked or just regular. Stacked comes with 6 Korean side dishes of your choice on the top deck of your bowl, and the bottom deck contains two meats of your choice (beef bulgogi extra $1), my favorite Korean vermicelli (jap chae) and rice or fresh greens (see photo).
It&#39;s tons of food for $9.50 seriously!!!

Must try side dishes:
Potato salad - creamy and savory, slightly sweet
Kimchi - perfect! Not too sour or spicy or salty
Spicy cucumbers - full of flavor and crunchy!
Bean sprouts - fresh and flavorful
Mac salad - love the bit of heat and flavor, macaroni could be more al dents

Good choices of meat:
Chicken bulgogi 

Their jap chae is really good so I recommend the stacked bowl because the other style doesn&#39;t come with the noodles. If that&#39;s too much carbs for you, like for me, you can choose fresh greens instead of rice :-)

The beef bulgogi wasn&#39;t that flavorful and beefy, although the marinade was good. Korean Fried Chicken (KFC they call, funny) had too much batter and not crunchy enough. Nah. 

Food was excellent for the price and the portions. Definitely not the best Korean food if that&#39;s what you&#39;re looking for, but it&#39;s pretty decent! For that, I give them 5 stars!"

It&#39;s pretty cramped due to the small size. Sometimes waiting for your order is awkward because you bump into so many people lol.

I got the bibimbap with brown rice. It came with 6 sides that you get to choose. I actually thought the bibimbap came with the regular vegetable toppings that you see in a typical bibimbap like carrots, radish, etc. but you literally pick your toppings as your sides. Kinda weird to have your potato salad in your bibimbap in my opinion.

Overall, the food was kinda bland. The kimchi wasn&#39;t that great and eventually the spice overpowered everything."

I thought the side banchan options could be better and was disappointed that they didn&#39;t have my beloved bean sprouts that almost every Korean restaurant has. They were very &#34;Americanized&#34; which I guess it the point. 

They asked me if I wanted sauce, and I said a little. They then proceeded to drown my plate in sauce. That sauce is too sweet and a little goes a long way, so in effect for me personally who doesn&#39;t like too much sweet on my dinner, it kind of ruined it for me."

I may need to rethink how I order moving forward.  I&#39;ve made bad decisions in my life this could be one.  Just like in Beauty and The Beast when Maurice is going to the invention fair and he&#39;s at a fork in the road, one leading to a dark forest and the other to daylight and he decides to take the dark forest.  Crazy old Maurice.  The menu essentially offers 5 different dishes, Stacked bowl (bowl with assorted sides, toppings and base of rice), Mix (Bibimbap style), Pork Cutlet Curry (on a bed of rice), a Gogi Wrap, or a &#34;K-Pop&#34;.  K-Pop allows you to have your dish on a bed of french fries.  French fries I tell you! What guy in their right mind is saying no to this?! I would marry French Fries if the law allowed it!

The second menu allows you to choose your base of salad or rice and your choice of protein (chicken bulgogi, spicy chicken, spicy pork, organic tofu, beef bulgogi and K.F.C. (korean fried chicken).  Of course thinking like a typical guy I already went heavy on the main bowl with french fries topped with kim chi and oozing melted cheese, so I continued the theme and went with the Korean fried chicken! Fried chicken on a bed of french fries tied together using melted cheese, kim chi and a korean sweet and spicy sauce.  You&#39;re not young anymore with these youngbuck USC kids Alex, you could hurt yourself.

All sound amazing, the outcome...disappointing.  Fried chicken was more like over fried batter, almost broke one of my teeth eating it! Fries...shamefully overrated.  So much potential with a wah-wah let down.

You then select your protein, base, sides and sauces-I&#39;m a fan of this concept! I&#39;ve tried the bulgogi and spicy pork and liked both. I&#39;ve tried the mixed and stacked bowl, and recommend the stacked bowl-it&#39;s about 50 cents more but you get more meat, glass noodles and your sides won&#39;t get all mixed up!

When I came here yesterday, it looks like they changed up their menu a bit, and have new items like the cutlet curry bowl, korean fried chicken, and even fries! 

They also have boba drinks and ice cream macaron sandwiches.

The sweet mustard is surprisingly almost tasteless. The taro slush ($3.85)is okay-a bit watered down tasting, but the boba is only a little bit too hard. The cup is quite tall. So it was okay!

However, I noticed that as time went by, the quality of their food significantly decreased...the meats became dry and the glass noodles (jap chae) became salty, so I stopped coming. Now that &#34;The Cup&#34; is opened a few stores down, I much prefer going there instead because they have a wider menu option and the food taste a lot better. Even so, I do think California Gogi Grill deserves a solid three stars because of its fast and friendly service, and the food is still OK."

It is a great lunch option and because portions are huge, it will probably keep you full until dinner. 

Food: I got the stacked box with salad, bulgogi and chicken. You also get to pick 6 sides so I picked 2 of the following: potato salad, cucumber, and bean sprouts. It was really delicious considering I was craving for some Korean food. To me, it seems like it is a bit Americanized but hey, its the closest Korean food I can get on foot near USC. Can&#39;t complain about it. The boba milk tea was decent. However I come from the 626 with many boba shops so to me, it was nothing special. Wouldn&#39;t get the boba milk tea again but I would come here to get my Korean food craving if I am around campus! 

Service: The servers are very delightful and are very kind. It was my first time there and they suggested half chicken and half bulgogi. I really appreciate that from them. Also the order process is very fast.

I know that this place literally means California meat, but their non-meat options are terrible. The tofu is fried weirdly in that the outside layer is semi deep fried and the inside is bland in taste. I asked them if I could get salad instead of meat, and they said no but I could choose to get it without any meat. Don&#39;t get me wrong, the food still tastes good but it&#39;s no longer worth the price that I am paying. 

Also, the service has gone down over the past few months. They no longer ask you what sauce you want, so you have to ask for it yourself. Lastly, the portion sizes of the toppings have decreased too. They only fill each section to 85% full. If you get lettuce, they only give you about ten strips.

Overall, this is still a good place to go to to satisfy a craving for Korean meats. This place used to be my favorite around USC, but my past few visits have been disappointing in terms of both their service and options."

-Beef Bulgogi/Spicy Pork Stacked Bowl: Was a little confused with this order because I got beef and chapchae in my bowl and no pork at all. Still was good but wondering what went wrong there...perhaps they mix the meats and the pork is not spicy? Do not know.

-Boba Milk Tea: Not amazing. Very average tasting when you compare it with other bobas around campus. I will try the slushes next time if I stop by again :)

-Sides I recommend: pickled radish, mashed potato, macaroni salad

I came here after a USC football, hungry for some Asian food.  This location is located right by Chipotle and few other restaurants.  There is a VERY small amount of seats inside and a few patio seats outside.  When I walked in, I was not sure if I was inside California Gogi Grill or Yogurtland as the decor was very similar.  It was super bright and cheery inside.  

The lady took our order very quickly.  I decided on the bowl, which came with 2 types of meat and jap chae (glass noodles).  I decided on the chicken bulgogi and spicy pork.  While I was waiting for my bowl, I wandered over to the next station, which gave me 6 types of ban chan (side dishes), which they put into a small plate with different compartments.  They had typical ban chan like pickles, radish, kimchi and a little less typical ban chan like corn, edamame, onion, etc.  The ban chan plate is places directly on top of the bowl.  They also provided 2 types of sauce.  The food came out pretty quickly and i have to say as a Korean who eats all types of homemade Korean food, I thought it was pretty decent for fast food.  The meats were pretty decent and the banchan tasted pretty fresh.  I mean it definitely wasn&#39;t the BEST Korean food I ever had, but it definitely was above average. I also like the fact that they gave a good amount for a relatively good price.  My bowl was about $8 and I still had plenty of leftover to take home. 

This is definitely a good option if you are craving fast food Korean food for a decent price.  I am not sure what the parking situation is like since I walked over after the USC game, but I think this would be a good place to eat if you are already on campus."

I love Korean food and I love chipotle, so I was eager to try this &#34;make-your-own Korean bowl place&#34;. Unfortunately, it doesn&#39;t quite live up to the Yelp hype.

They offer a healthy spin on the traditional Korean bibimbap (and some other things). You can pick your sides, which include some traditional items like kimchi and some non-traditional like kale salad. I do like that you can get brown rice without paying anything extra, so you&#39;re not paying a premium for your health. It&#39;s just that the sides are just...eh. Some are under seasoned and kinda flavorless.

They offer a few starter options (bowl, burrito, salad, fries etc). It&#39;s build-your-own from there. I ordered the stacked bowl because it included two meat options, glass noodles + white or brown rice and six mini banchan. 

I choose the chicken bulgogi &amp; spicy pork (kinda like al pastor) with white rice &amp; the banchan. Everything was delicious! The meats were seasoned well. The combination of the rice and glass noodles hit the spot. The banchan was decent &amp; definitely sample sizes portions.

I had the Bibimbap again. The good news they no longer fry their tofu so I tried that instead of the chicken that seems to not taste like any chicken I have ever had. If I had to eat rodent that would seem more like the consistency. With the tofu you get three very tiny super thin slices. Not to mention it is in a tiny little bowl. The lady told me you actually get more. First it is much lighter in weight so that is not possible. Also I was finished and I starving! I went to another place got a Mexican combination plate.

Being Korean, I&#39;m always skeptical of how each place marinates and flavors their meats, but the spicy pork is spot on!! It is so delicious. The sides aren&#39;t the best, but I haven&#39;t tried a bad one. The potato salad seems to be the fan fave. I personally love spicy things, so I always go for kimchi, spicy pickled radish, spicy pickled cucumbers, etc. For the best bang for you buck, go for the stacked bowl.

Location: Literally a hop and a skip from the USC campus. Very convenient to get to.

Parking: Way easier to park in the structure they are located in and get validated it. Finding street parking is just a hassle so just take advantage of the 45 mins free.

Prices: A little pricy compared to joints like Chipotle, Togo&#39;s, and Chick-Fil-A nearby.

Food/Portions: At first glance, it doesn&#39;t look like alot considering they DO seem to skimp on the sides, but one bowl can easily make 2 meals. I usually order the mix bowl, basically their take on bimbimbap. In the mix bowl you get one pretty big scoop of rice, salad, and then chosen meat/tofu.  If you&#39;re feeling very carnivorous, I would suggest getting the DOSIRAK option, which separates the sides from the bowl itself. 

Final thoughts: Depending on the day I go I feel like they skimp on the sides for the bowls, but at the end of the day this isn&#39;t too big an issue because I&#39;m usuallly stuffed when I finish."

I&#39;ll keep this review quick and efficient, which is a lot like how I think California Gogi has earned a five star rating so far on Yelp. They are like the Chipotle of Korean fast food and that means a clean operation that gets you in and out as quickly as possible so you can fill up and still feel good about eating fast food. (unsurprisingly, they are located right next door to a Chipotle)

They also sell bobas in addition to a menu of Asian fusion type items such as tacos, wraps, and sandwiches. All are customizable by meat/rice/banchan and sauces.

Bibimbap ($6.80) - (choice of bulgogi chicken/beef/pork/spicy pork or even tofu)

PROS: 
- price
- choice of fresh sides (6) - anything from spicy kimchee to potato salad - this place has most of the standard banchan you&#39;d find at an AYCE KBBQ place
- portion size (the bowl is big and they generally fill it up to more than 1/2 so that means quite a bit of food

CONS:
- I wish they had more meat. There were only a few pieces of Beef Bulgogi
- the meat quality could be better

Conclusion: I like California Gogi. It actually is my friend Brian&#39;s new favorite casual spot to get some very cheap and filling food. It is almost like going to a KBBQ place but without all the hassle."

I should rate this place as if I was a college student, but I&#39;m not, so I&#39;ll talk about it from both sides of the coin. Gogi is located in a row of fast food restaurants and is part of the Tuscany (SUPER luxury) apartments across the street from USC&#39;s main campus. Went here for lunch with the gf not knowing what to expect, as I elected not to read the reviews before coming here. It has a 5-star rating with 73 reviews, so I decided to go in semi-blind. Upon walking in it feels like a Yogurtland: walls are VERY white and makes the place seem very sterile, and there were ZERO Korean people working the day we went, so I didn&#39;t expect authenticity. 

Parking 4/5
There is limited parking in the Tuscany parking lot, so it really depends on the time of day you show up. Parking is free for the first 45 minutes, I believe.

Ambience 3/5
White walls, with staff rocking bright orange uniforms. Banchan is laid out next to the register in Chipotle fashion. Enough counter seating for about 7 people with outdoor tables that are shared by Chipotle, Chik-Fil-A, Quizno&#39;s, etc.

Service 4/5
Staff were very knowledgable and courteous, and walked us through our orders. No complaints here.

Food 3.5/5
Food quality/taste: 3 stars, portion size: 4 stars

Do-si-rak (Mixed bowl) - B+
You choose how you want your food, so we elected for the bowl. Then you choose your base (brown/white rice). After that you choose 5-6 Banchan (sides to mix in). They had a lot of traditional banchan like kimchi and spicy radish, but unfortunately no fried egg. Egg looked &#34;crumbled&#34;, but I went with that anyway. The bowl itself was alright, but the fact that I could only get through half of it was great because I could eat the rest as a snack later that afternoon, which is exactly what I would&#39;ve done as a college student as well.

Overall 4/5
The food is OK, but the portion size of the bowls adds to the value for college students here. In a way I don&#39;t like the Chipotle-style options, and would have loved to see the food prepared in a more authentic fashion, but I live in Koreatown and I&#39;m biased. For college students from out of state who have never tried Korean food, this is a great way to warm up to it. I suppose with a name like California Gogi Korean Grill, one should not expect the traditional cuisine. I suppose a suitable upgrade to this place could be Hodori, and then on to the more traditional places like Hodong Baekjong."

My experience, another one of the assembly line establishments.  This is the Chipotle of Korean Food haha

I ordered a BimBimBap bowl with spicy pork.  So you wait for them to call your name and you get to pick 6 different types of ban chans, not bad.  It was a bit pricey but I was hungry.

Overall, the bowl was tasty and the ban chan items I chose such as kim chi, spicy cucumber, potato, cabbage etc was tasty."

The concept is similar to chipotle where you choose from several different foods and can add your own toppings/options.  It gives you the convenience of fast food, but gives with the more healthy options of Korean food. Unfortunately, you trade off quality and taste in return for the convenience with the meat being quite bland and food not being the most fresh. This is still a decent place to stop by if you just want a quick but healthy meal."

It&#39;s perfect for a quick to-go Korean bbq fix. For the stacked bowl it&#39;s a generous portion and pretty inexpensive. You get rice(brown rice for no additional cost), glass noodles, 2 meats, and 6 sides for just over $8 after tax. The beef was okay but I loved the spicy pork! Will probably get all spicy pork next time. The sides were good also. I got double bean sprouts, carrots, corn, edamame, and spicy cucumber. The carrots were in a yummy marinade and spicy cucumbers were good. Didn&#39;t really care for the cold edamame. 
We also tried the gobi fries with beef, which I wasn&#39;t so impressed with. Probably won&#39;t order those again. 

Awesome service! From the moment we walked in the cashier was super helpful in guiding us with the menu and telling her favorites.

Here, the meat as well as the veggies are all the same serving size - basically one tablespoon or a small ice cream scoop of each. Give me more meat! Rice must be expensive because even that portion decreased and they make it up with salad. If I wanted a salad, I could&#39;ve gotten one elsewhere or made one at home. It wasn&#39;t like this previous times I&#39;ve visited so this must be a recent change and a change that I am not too fond of.

There are so many banchan options, ranging from kimchi to egg to pickled cucumbers and they really help to top the meal off well! I don&#39;t know if this is how youre supposed to eat it but I usually just dump all the banchan into the bowl and mix it together. The variety of flavors makes it taste amazing.

There are also a lot of options in terms of sauces. I personally cannot handle spice (practically AT ALL) but the Sriracha Aioli sauce is the perfect sweetness to add great flavor to the bowl."

It is basically a make-your-own Bibimbap (Korean mixed bowl) fast food joint.

Step 1: Select your style - Stacked bowl, taco, sandwich, wrap, or mixed bowl
Step 2: Select your rice - white or brown
Step 3: Select your meat - bulgogi, spicy pork, chicken, tofu, etc.
Step 4: Select your panchan (sides)
Step 5: Select your sauce

At first I wasn&#39;t sure what the difference between the stacked bowl or mixed bowl was except the price, but the difference is that with the stacked bowl you get your sides separately, and with the mixed bowl it&#39;s all mixed into one bowl.

I decided to get the stacked bowl - it came with rice, japchae, lettuce, and bulgogi.  Then I got to choose 6 sides that were &#34;stacked&#34; on top in a separate platter.  For the sauce, I went with the mixed sauce, which tasted like the traditional bibimbap red sweet and spicy sauce.

All in all I thought it was a pretty filling and delicious meal.  I&#39;d definitely get the bulgogi over the spicy pork (husband got that and instantly regretted it - it tasted chewy and dry).  

Would recommend, but not wow-ed or blown away by it."

I actually found California Gogi Korean Grill through Yelp since it was trending. It is a very good concept and it includes a lot of variety. You can choose between 5 different dishes and 6 different meats! The possibilities are endless.!

I ordered the tacos and of course tried 3 different meats. The meal of course would have cost me $12-$20 had I gone to a trendy food truck. However, this meal only cost $6.50 plus the cost of a boba milk tea.

I do not recommend the boba drinks mainly because I am from the San Gabriel Valley and I am a bit of a boba connoisseur (or boba-seur if you will, lol). Still, when you&#39;re craving boba it still hits the spot.

This is a fun convenient way of getting a decent Korean food fix without having to hunt down a food truck or head into an area where the menu is in a different language. It is fast and the staff was very friendly.

I will come back to try the rice bowls!

Eat up!"

The stacked bowls are the best thing to get here because you get the biggest meal and the most meat. You choose white rice, brown rice, or salad (but the bowl already comes with some salad greens no matter what you choose, so get rice!). Then you choose a meat from spicy chicken, chicken, beef bulgogi, pork bulgogi, and spicy pork. The beef bulgogi has a yummy flavor, but is kind of chewy. The spicy chicken is very delicious.

Then, when your order is ready, you get to choose 6 toppings + 2 sauces! The potato salad is yummy to eat on the side, but it&#39;s great to mix in spicy cucumbers, corn, bean sprouts, carrots, and spicy radish into your rice bowl. The sauces are better mixed together. The &#34;hot sauce&#34; is actually REALLY sweet. It&#39;s tasty, but you need to mix it with something else. The &#34;mix&#34; sauce tastes very strongly of gojuchang (Korean bean paste) but it&#39;s good. The best sauce in my opinion is the Korean chili paste because it has a very pure, clean, spicy flavor.

No bathroom, but there&#39;s a chipotle next door, so help yourself haha. Overall, a nice place to grab a quick lunch while you&#39;re in the area, but no need to make the drive especially for this."

I was skeptical. Probably wouldn&#39;t have tried the place if it weren&#39;t just so convenient to walk to from work. Turns out I&#39;m down for Chipotle-style bibimbap.

The stacked bowl was tempting, but I went for #5 mix (bibimbap) with beef bulgogi. Sticking to the classics. You choose the meat/tofu, white or brown rice, and 6 add-ins. I got egg, carrot, and everything else preceded by the word &#34;spicy,&#34; trying to ensure that true Korean level of heat in my meal. AND I WASN&#39;T DISAPPOINTED. They have quite a few sauce options, including a sriracha aioli. Interesting, but also the mildest of the choices. Of course, I went with the spiciest, Korean chili paste. I expected gochujang, but what I got was waterier... no less spicy though. APPROVED.

They offer sesame oil and seaweed to add on after you&#39;ve chosen your six sides. The seaweed was flaked, and I would have liked a little more in mine. Still, the oil and seaweed made it smell so delicious and familiar.

It turned out to be a little sweeter than I would have liked, but the spiciness was on point. The mix was flavorful, and I had no trouble finishing mine. 

The price is excellent for the portion size! I took one look and thought, &#34;I&#39;m definitely saving some of this for later...&#34; and proceeded to finish it off in about 15 minutes. I guess it was good. 

I&#39;d definitely go back if I&#39;m hungry and within walking distance! I&#39;d love to see this place in the Pasadena area. The bibimbap glory of K-town is just a little too close to justify going here too often. :P"

The bowl comes with a supposedly larger portion and a separate tray for the banchan and is $0.50 more than the bibimbap which has everything in the bowl. Portions looks relatively similar to me so you may just be paying for the tray.

I usually get the bibimbap, since I get full easily and the amount of food more than fills me up.  However, if you are a more hearty eater, the stacked bowl might be more worth your money because you get significantly more rice and meat with that combination.

Sometimes one of the owners will be serving you!  She was extremely knowledgable, and was really nice when giving me recommendations for which banchan (side dishes) or sauces went best with my beef bulgogi bibimbap.  (I can&#39;t say the same for the other workers, though.)

My only gripes are that they are a big stingy when it comes to the sides, and that the line can be pretty long at times (+ very limited seating)... but for the general deliciousness, quality, price (+ health!

Korean food has generally remained pretty authentic and not &#34;Americanized&#34; like lots of Chinese food, but recently Roy Choi has changed a lot of that. Gogi takes it another step further by having a customizable fast casual ordering style in the vein of Chipotle and tastes reminiscent of Flame Broiler, but Korean fusion. 

You pick your &#34;style&#34; (bowl, wrap, taco, sandwich), rice, meat, banchan (side dishes), and sauce, so there is a lot of selection here. You can go healthy or low-carb with the brown rice or salad option, and all the meats I tried (spicy pork, beef bulgogi, and chicken) were all delicious. 

There are two types of rice bowls: the stacked bowl and the bibimbap. The stacked bowl is slightly more expensive but has way more rice, whereas the bibimbap has more salad than rice. With the tacos, you&#39;re getting much less food overall, but the nice thing is you can get different types of meat for each taco. It wasn&#39;t bad, kind of a more bland, more healthy version of Kogi.

As for the banchan, you can pick up to six types, and the kimchi was surprisingly good.The rice was a bit soggy though, and the sauces are kind of small, so I&#39;d grab a couple of those, also because they&#39;re kind of mild.

The ice cream macarons weren&#39;t that good and pretty expensive at $3.50 a pop.

The entrees range from $6-7.50 so it&#39;s very affordable and they give you large portions.

California Gogi is really good for what it is: fast Korean food. They even give you a decent variety of ban chans/sides. 

Service is surprisingly fast for how chaotic the lines look. Price is about 7-8 dollars, and although you&#39;re not going to get Chipotle size portions (which I don&#39;t think is a fair comparison for any restaurant), I do get full after. Either that, or I can&#39;t handle the burn of the spicy pork and must save it for another meal."

The difference between the lunch and regular dishes are that the lunch dishes are slightly smaller.  They all cost around $10.  I got the pad see you here and it was a little sweeter than I usually like it but still pretty tasty.  My friends all finished their food too.

My Pad See Ew was excellent. Perfectly cooked noodles in a delicious dark soy sauce with fresh American broccoli. The tofu chunks were flavorful and had great texture.

If you know anything about me, you should know that green curry is my favorite non-dessert food. I could eat green curry every day of my life and would be perfectly happy (I&#39;ve actually done this before). So, Summer Buffalo passed my Green Curry test. The flavor was delicate and delicious, and the brown rice that came with the meal was the Thai-style almost seed like brown rice which has a very earthy flavor and soothing chewy texture. I wish that they wouldn&#39;t have put it directly in the curry, as I don&#39;t usually eat all of the curry, but next time I would be sure to specify.

The ambiance is very fun and very Los Angeles. It&#39;s also conveniently located near The Groundlings theatre and many cool and trendy bars in case you want to have some more fun after dinner. Just make sure to get there a bit early because parking really sucks on Melrose."

The noodles were really chewy and had awesome texture going on (even after a couple days as leftovers haha) and flavored just right! Not too salty or bland.

Also had the burmese tea salad. Wow! Never had anything like it! There&#39;s so many things going on in the salad.

We ordered crispy fried egg rolls, dumplings in green curry, summer rolls, pad thai, gapow gai with fried egg, pad kee mau and mango sticky rice. All the food was very clean and health feeling. The eggrolls were rolled up like a pencil and stuck inside a carryout box, thought it was a cute way to package it. The sauce is under the wax paper. 

I liked the flavorful gapow gai with the perfectly cooked gooey egg. I liked the thai peppers that gave an instant kick. The pad thai had no color which was weird but the flavors were all there, I liked how the peanuts were in a separate container. The pad kee mau could use a little more flavor and sauces to give that &#34;drunken&#34; texture and taste. I LOVED the sticky rice, it was really really chewy and sticky, worked perfectly with their coconut sauce and mangos! 

There was no heavy sauces on any of the plates and there wasn&#39;t any eater&#39;s remorse because it felt healthy. I think it&#39;s low in calories too."

I like the shards of ice they used, and how the color and texture when you mixed it with your straw; the taste just right including the after-taste feeling, not too sweet and not too strong but refreshment. 

Chicken dumplings as my starting-appetizer, which had a nice green spicy (mild) curry over it (in a soup-form).  Color isn&#39;t green but never had that curry taste before; not sure how to describe it but taste and feels good with it.  Comes with a spoon, so be sure to drink the sauce afterwards.

Pad Thai was my main dish, not greasy, taste healthy and fill up my stomach well with the right portion of noodles, veggies and meat.  Usually I don&#39;t like chicken with my Pad Thai, but comes with chicken along with shrimp.  Chicken isn&#39;t fried, dry or rough, but taste light and was well made (marinated).

1. Shrimp summer rolls with rice paper- fresh and cool cut up so beautifully and the rice paper has the perfect texture. No often find it too chewy at some places but it&#39;s perfect here. The peanut sauce and the spicy chili sauce are both wonderful 

2. Spicy coconut curry chicken bowl ( substitute the shrimp for chicken)
HUGE portion with stringy thick perfectly Al dente egg noddles in a delightful creamy sweet and spicy coconut sauce. This was my favorite dish 

3. Steamed curry Chicken dumplings - perfectly steamed. Love the texture and flavors especially of the curry. If ya can&#39;t stand the heat get outta the kitchen 

4. Garlic edamame - probably one of my favorite dishes here. Edemame is steamed to perfection and the sauce is not too overwhelming. Sweet and salty in perfect balance

5. 3.4/5 Green curry tofu and veggies with brown rice: so I love the brown rice it&#39;s very organic and tasty. I LOVE the curry sauce it&#39;s creamy and has the perfect amount of heat and saltiness. The veggies were deliciously crunchy just how I love them.

Thus, we selected Summer Buffalo out of the three choices.  As a thai fusion restaurant, I had some hesitations about the food.  Normally if a place has &#34;fusion&#34; to describe the food, it could a skeet shot.  I mean, there&#39;s places that serve doughnuts and Chinese food!  How&#39;s that combination?  I know, right?

Anyway, I placed my assumptions to the side and met my friends there.  Summer Buffaloo&#39;s space is rather large.  I would call the decor industrial.  It fit the Melrose trendiness if that is still a description.  

I ordered the grilled pork butt to share with my friends and the braised lamb shank in massaman curry as my entree.  As mentioned in my other reviews, I am a sucker or duck, pork or lamb.

The pork butt was tender and meaty.  I was surprised that my friend that is usually on a diet ate most of it.  Damn him.  It was really good.  As for the braised lamb shank in curry, this dish is large.  I mean large enough that I couldn&#39;t finish eating it.  The shank was tender and the curry helped add flavor to the juicy shank.   It comes with a heaping portion of rice.  So, if you are on a low carb diet, you may want to see if you can substitute.  If not, give the rice to a hungry friend who claims to be on a diet too.  (I&#39;m not judging....).

The service here was rather fast on a Saturday night.  Our dishes came out in a good time that we were able to eat and enjoy them over a good conversation.

Perfect spot to feel &#34;very L.A&#34; if you also happen to love Thai food. The food here all tastes very clean and includes fresh vegetables and meats. Really fresh eating experience, similar to what one experiences eating good Vietnamese spring rolls. 

The Thai Tea (one of my most favorite beverages ever) is delicious and comes in fun glasses and jars. 

The peanut sauce/salad dressing literally changed my life. I&#39;m not kidding on this one. Make SURE you get a salad or a side salad if you go to this place (provided you&#39;re not allergic to nuts) because the sauce/dressing they use is absolutely incredible. Totally turns a salad from a sad pile of garden items to a savory, lip-licking experience. I looked up peanut sauce recipes when I got home- that&#39;s how good it was!"

With LA traffic and during lunch time, 45 mins is actually really good. The food was warm/hot, delicious and NOT greasy. I really enjoyed it. 
Giving 4 starts because I ordered shrimp and chicken pad tai and I got only 2 shrimp, but it was a good size meal. I&#39;ll probably eat it for lunch, dinner and breakfast tomorrow :)
The coconut ice cream was bomb! And whoever put it on ice so it doesn&#39;t melt till I get it, is very smart person! 
I&#39;ll order again, as long as I get more than 2 shrimp ;)

P.S. People complaining that Thai people answer the phone... Well, order at Dennis and You can speak English. It&#39;s a Thai place, of course people will have accent on the other side of the phone. At least you know it&#39;s authentic Thai food."

The rundown:
I scored parking in front(lucky me on busy Melrose)
The place was clean
The server was on the ball
The food was very good (I had the Chicken Curry Noodles)

My niece ordered the salmon curry noodles which she liked very much.

Overall, the food seemed like it was made with healthier ingredients than you sometimes get when you have Thai food.

This spot reminds me a lot of Summer Canteen on Lankershim in NoHo or The Rustic Spoon close by.

I would give this place 5 stars but parking is a mofo. If you don&#39;t mind spending time looking for parking, this place would be 5 stars in MY opinion.

I&#39;m going back this Friday with some minions from work. I hope the food was as good as the first time."

It&#39;s a cute, little place on the corner of Melrose Ave and Poinsettia Pl with a contemporary yet cozy atmosphere.

My friend and I stopped by for dinner on a Saturday night. The set-up included a party of about 10 people in the center, with smaller tables for 2 throughout the rest of the dining room area. One or two of these smaller tables seemed a little &#34;removed,&#34; but otherwise there was enough space for everyone. 

The din of the party was only slightly overpowering, but only because the place is open concept and on the smaller side. While it wasn&#39;t a problem for us, it does change the mood a little bit. As such, I would say that this place is best for a 1:1 with a friend - maybe a small group of friends. I wouldn&#39;t recommend it for a large party, and hesitate to say that it would be a good place to have a more intimate date or first date.

The service was decent, but started to slack a little closer to closing time. It wasn&#39;t a huge issue.

Food wise - this place was GREAT!
We started with the Steamed Dumplings in Curry Sauce appetizer, which was probably the best dish I&#39;ve had at a Thai restaurant. I highly recommend it. The flavors were a perfect balance of lite, fresh, and savory. While it seems a little pricey at $8, we got 6 medium-sized dumplings, which was perfect for sharing. I think it could also easily satisfy on its own, as a snack or small meal for one...one small person.

For my entree, I ordered the Pad Kee Mau (Drunken Noodles). I ask asked for a little extra spice, and the result was PERFECTION - great flavors and a good portion. Pair that with a Thai iced tea and I&#39;m was a happy man.

I also noticed that they also offer a bunch of unique drinks/infusions that I haven&#39;t seen before. I&#39;ll have to try them. Next time.

Overall, I&#39;d definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a good Thai restaurant in the area."

Their service is very subpar. I walked in with my boyfriend and our dog. We asked if we could eat at their outdoor table. They said yes. Our waitress came to our table about 15 minutes after we sat down and then took our order.  

Then we were told that despite their table being outside, they were not licensed to serve people outside. Since our dog was with us, they told us that we could take the food we had ordered to go. They then took another 30 minutes and the waitress arrived not with our food but with our bill. We paid and 15 minutes more went by. My boyfriend went back in and asked if our food was coming. The waitress told him it was first come first serve and there was nothing they could do. He then asked for a refund. The waitress then brought out the manager. The manager said either you get the food or your money back. He said that we had been waiting for a very long time and this was unacceptable. The manager gave us our order ticket and told us that our order had been in their queue for only a few minutes and we would have to continue to wait. I have never been treated this poorly in my life.

Every dish I&#39;ve had has been super tasty. I really enjoy their tangy/sweet buffalo wings, all the curry&#39;s are good (I really like the panang w/ beef), the summer fried rice is really good too.

We order a lot on Eat24. This place was new on the list, so decided to give it a try, since we love Thai food. I didn&#39;t quite get the name, but hey, who cares. From the name I would have expected a bbq place. 

Fist and foremost, the delivery was there 20 minutes before the promised time. Everything was very hot. 

The Tom Kah Gai soup. It was one of the best I&#39;ve had. 

The Chicken Satay was also the best I&#39;ve had. 4, nice big pieces, the peanut sauce was thick and tasted better than any other I&#39;ve had. And the side cucumber salad was also amazing; better than any.

The Pad Thai (I always order a pad Thai first from a Thai restaurant to see if I will like it. If they can&#39;t make a decent Pad Thai, I won&#39;t order again.) was probably the least amazing, but it was very good, but nothing extraordinary (well, Pad Thai really isn&#39;t too amazing). It was a bit more on the savory side (which I liked) and it was FULL of chicken (probably twice as much than from any other Thai place). There were only two pieces of shrimp, but at least the shell was removed from the tail (I hate dealing with the shell on the tail), so that was a big plus. It could have had a bit more crushed peanuts on the side, but that wasn&#39;t a deal-breaker. I can definitely order from them again.

My hubby had the Not So Ordinary Orange Chicken and indeed it wasn&#39;t ordinary. He thought it was amazing and he loved it. He didn&#39;t even leave me any to try.

We also had the Sticky Rice with Mango for dessert and that&#39;s something that&#39;s hard to screw up.

They don&#39;t charge for delivery, so that&#39;s fantastic and it didn&#39;t hurt either that the delivery boy was beautiful. Just because of him I want to order every day hoping that he would be the one to deliver again. :-)

They&#39;re definitely our new Thai delivery place."

The garlic pepper chicken wings are awesome! The pad thai is good and not too greasy. I&#39;m a fan of the egg rolls, but my husband doesn&#39;t eat mushrooms.

I was surprised to get some authentic flavors in a modern, cute ambiance - I did catch the waitress and one of the chefs speaking in Thai, so it&#39;s nice to see some actual Thai people influencing the scene.

My group of 4 came in at 6pm on a Sunday, and I think it&#39;s a good thing we made a reservation - the restaurant isn&#39;t that big. Service was prompt and friendly, though perhaps a check-in to see how our meal was going would have been nice.

-- Frog legs: one of my favorite items! I&#39;d never tried frog legs before, and truly, they were pretty much like skinny chicken wings. They were nicely fried but not overly breaded, and the legs and the sauce were both seasoned excellently.
-- Dumplings with green curry: kind of weird. Not bad, but they were like boiled Chinese dumplings with Thai green curry, which was just an odd combination; the flavors were kind of separate and didn&#39;t marry well.
-- Summer rolls: good sauce but I didn&#39;t love the rolls, probably because they were chock full of bean sprouts, of which I am not a fan.
-- Grilled pork butt: had the flavor profile of moo ping (Thai grilled pork on skewers, usually found at street vendor carts in Thailand and eaten with sticky rice). The marinade and the char from the grill was great, but the cut of meat was a little on the fatty side; it was tender and well-cooked, but I think I prefer my meat less fatty.
-- Pad kee mau: WHOA. Their default medium is truly a &#34;Thai medium&#34;, which agrees with the statement on their menu that their spice is authentic =p My mouth was slightly aflame but it was so worth it. Very tasty, as good as the better pad kee mau&#39;s I&#39;ve had at mom &amp; pop Thai restaurants.
-- Sweet sassy sole: the fish was perfectly flaky with a thin crispy fried coating, and it went very well with the sweet and sour sauce - nicely balanced. I really enjoyed this dish.

Although I liked some items more than others, they were all well-made and there were certainly some stars that I&#39;ll go back for. It&#39;s too bad I don&#39;t live closer - I will try to make the &#34;trek&#34; from Palms again soon!"

I ordered for pickup the Pad See Ew and the Tom Kha (vegetarian) soup. The Pad See Ew was standard but thankfully not greasy like a lot of the thai places like to make it. The Tom Kha was a bit disappointing, it was watered down and didn&#39;t have almost any vegetables at all, and absolutely no spice or flavor like I could&#39;ve just been eating a creamy lemon soup. I haven&#39;t tried any of their other dishes, but it felt like just another hipster joint on Melrose.  

I am merely basing my review on the Pad See Ew which was pretty decent, and the fact that my order was ready to go when I came to pick it up at the time they indicated. However, parking around this area can be difficult so I recommend using their pickup or delivery system since there&#39;s only street parking available on Melrose. The prices here are not too expensive but definitely higher than a lot of the more traditional Thai places such as the ones on Thai Town. I believe I payed $16 for both items which I felt was a little steep for a small soup and one entree in comparison to other Thai restaurants I&#39;ve been to outside the mid city area.

Thai food in LA. Not much GREAT Thai food (that i know of, but i hold out hope!) But this is not even mediocre.

This food is touted like a great experiment in food thought and execution but i hate to say it, it tastes like weak Thai food in a mall food court. 

Okay enough rant. We got delivery
Tom Kah: strangely too sweet
Tea leaf salad: actually inedible totally lacking in strong fermented flavors just strange

They have lunch specials, running about $9, but we opted for the regular options.  We shared a chicken satay and then I got the pad Thai, which came with chicken, shrimp and tofu, a Thai iced tea, and a coconut water (which came in a huge coconut).  I wonder if it was actually straight from the coconut or if they just cut the coconut and poured canned coconut water in.

Pro&#39;s: Seems a bit healthier than your usual thai joint. Presentation was nice, I also like that they give you some greens with the rice.

Con&#39;s: Delivery took over an hour on a monday night at 8pm. My husband got orange chicken, it smelled like the oil was dirty and he said it wasn&#39;t very good. I got green curry medium spicy and there was no spice to speak of, the curry was super watery and could have used more veggies. Mango sticky rice wasn&#39;t the best and it was $8. Mango was tangy not sweet, the white sauce was the traditional kind but very watered down and it was served with white sticky rice, which is fine but If you have black rice why not do black sticky rice?

The only downside was that because we sat next to the kitchen, we had a vent or fan wafting hot chili fumes over our table. There were a few minutes there when we found our eyes tearing and it hard to breathe, but luckily it soon passed.

There&#39;s a parking lot behind the restaurant that is free if you ask Summer Buffalo to validate the ticket. Remember to bring a cash tip for the parking lot attendant - he is super nice and will take good care of your car!"

Having that said, the deco was nice and the food was delicious. Maybe next time when the service improves."

The food arrived within 5 minutes of the estimated delivery time, everything was hot, and the food itself was delicious. 

I ordered the Pad See You and the Tom Kah soup. Both were fantastic quality, fairly inexpensive, and the portion sizes were generous. 

Also, no delivery fee? Don&#39;t hate that at all.

Their brown rice isn&#39;t usual brown rice but it had more texture and made my meal extremely good and on top of that, it has eggplant in it. Normally, there&#39;s no eggplant in Grapow, so it was so new to me and amazingly good with it.

While the Thai food here is pretty good (I&#39;ve had better Pad Thai, to be honest), Summer Buffalo has not failed in the flavor department. They have even gone so far as to have one of my favorite dishes of all time on their menu: Salmon Curry Noodle. 

I have had this dish three times on three separate visits to this restaurant and have been blown away each time. The curry is light and flavorful, the noodles are perfectly chewy and the addition of a no-nonsense sized piece of salmon filet brings this dish to another level.

A few more suggestions would include the curry dumplings and the chicken wings. Make sure you check this spot out."

While the atmosphere was nice and the service was super friendly we were both disappointed by the food. The egg rolls were solid but not noteworthy; the lemongrass mussels were quite disappointing as they had very little taste and were kind of dry. The green veggie curry was ok - the ingredients seemed really fresh and the brown rice was great but it seemed like something you could cook better at home (more seasoning). The lamb massaman curry had too thick of a consistency and was quite underwhelming. All in all I may go back for a little snack if I&#39;m in the area and am hungry but not something would seek out that soon again. 3 stars because the ingredients seemed like good quality and it&#39;s a nice spot with friendly waiters but I wouldn&#39;t agree with the 5 stars people seem to be giving.

The food was OK--had the pad kee mao (which is a lot spicier than I was expecting) and the summer fried rice. Both were standard take-out fare; nothing that got my loins excited.

When I go back I&#39;m going to be sure to ask them to actually make it authentic spicy. We also got the mango and sticky rice cause my friend hadn&#39;t tried it before and the mango was so fresh and tasty and the rice was nice and sticky and not too sweet, though I&#39;d like a little less condensed milk on it and just more roasted black sesame seed.

I&#39;m a vegetarian who occasionally eat fish so I&#39;ve tried their fish taco &amp; mixed veggies burritos. They do have plenty of options of vegetarians &amp; vegan choices so that&#39;s a good note for vegetarians! 

First, when you order any type of burritos, you have choice of salas which they offer 4-5 different kinds from green to red, mild, hot etc. They will mixed with choice of your salsa into your burritos. But check this... I found this is very odd... So they don&#39;t give you an extra salsa with your orders, either tacos or burritos. And each time when I asked for an extra salsa, either they hesitate or they would say. &#34;Oh salsa is inside of your burritos&#34;.  Not sure what&#39;s the reason for them to cheap out on salsa? I mean, I&#39;m eating Mexican food &amp; most people enjoy salsa over their tacos or burritos. Or most people don&#39;t care about salsa in Silverlake? In any event, when you order your dish, you do need ask for an extra salsa!  Especially, when you make your order to go, you ended up getting home and eating your tacos with no freaking salsa! So good luck with that....

Second, choice of their ingredients on mixed veggies burritos are pretty interesting but some of ingredient ended up over powering others, such as green chilly is way too much VS mushrooms. I hardly taste mushrooms &amp; I ended up opening the damn burritos to see if they missed out the mushrooms. I guess you can try different type of veggie burritos and choose the one you like!  

Last, fish tacos are super smelly! Oh man, I ended up giving half of my fish to my dog. Couldn&#39;t stand it... And again, I had to asked for salsa with my tacos... Seriously Dude, just give me that damn salsa!!!"

A little funky, not in a bad way. Real good food. I had the Chicken Burrito. In a word Very, Very Good. OK three words. There were 7 of us, not one complaint, only good things were said about Mixto Comida Latina&#39;s food. We all had different thing, my one daughter had the fish tacos, the other had a bowl meal, which one...I don&#39;t know. Everyone left Mixto Comida Latina happy and satisfied.

The one complaint I have, and it&#39;s not specific to Mixto Comida Latina, is they don&#39;t allow BYOB. As I understand it, and I checked on the web, NOBODY, but nobody has a firm understanding on BYOB laws, rules and regulations in California. You&#39;ll read some very well written positions on both sides of the issue on the web. One insisting that NO, you can&#39;t bring a bottle to any place that doesn&#39;t have an alcohol license, and yet others that will quote you laws that support BYOB - Anywhere!

Hell, I just wanted a beer or 2 with my dinner!

Someone, somewhere needs to get this shit straightened out, and inform ALL dining establishments of the Official stand on this.

And...if California DOESN&#39;T allow you to BYOB to any non-alcohol licensed establishment,
well, that really needs to be changed_Now!

It&#39;s perfectly fine to BYOB on the East coast, at least in New Jersey and Pennsylvania."

Tacos
Burritos
Tortas
Quesadillas
And then there&#39;s 
Bowls
Salads

They also offer up fresh juices aside from the usual horchata, jamaica, and tamarindo.

They have an almond milk horchata which is delicious btw, basil watermelon, cucumber mint, and others.

Back to the food, I&#39;ve tried the bowls, burritos, and kale salad.

Carne asada is good. Carnitas = yum. 
Chile relleno burrito is all kinds of comfort 
Bowls get the job done and for me are the most filling. The only thing I don&#39;t like is the fact that there is too much bean juice in the bowl and everything gets very soggy, almost soupy.

They have four different kinds of salsas to choose from... Mild avocado crema, green tomatillo, red, and habanero green.

Last but not least, guacamole and chips are a must!!!! Super fresh and lemony :)

I mean, I&#39;m here like every week! This used to be Burrito King (RIP) and though I was sad to see that place go, I love Mixto&#39;s burritos and tacos made with organic humane meats like chicken, pork and beef. Plus, with all the lovely fixins, customers can select a salsa to be added to their meal. Very fresh! Dee-lishhhhh!!! Plus, it&#39;s organic!

Besides their tacos and burritos, they also have bowls, which is not something we Latinos are accustomed to. But, we like it anyway. ;) Still great flavors with cilantro, onions, salsa, queso y todo! That&#39;s right, vatos locos!  

Another special item that can be found here are their fried plantains, also known as maduros in the Cuban world, cooked to perfection, along with a dollop of crema mexicana! So delicate and delicious! I could seriously eat these all the time! (Why does it seem like I&#39;m yelling while  writing this review?) 

In addition to the things mentioned above, they have specials like almond horchata. If you haven&#39;t tried it yet, you must! It&#39;s delicately sweet with a touch of cinnamon and a lovely texture. It&#39;s delightful, really.

Plus, they sometimes have great desserts like their key lime pie. Once again, delicately sweet. 

In addition to their great food, these folks are doing their part in being eco-friendly, like having different portals for recycling and composting. And if you know me, this brings a smile to this earth-loving gal! 

And, the people that work here are awesome! They are so refreshingly nice. So chill and willing to engage in conversation. :) 

The prices for the food here are decently priced, especially for what you get! (Burrito King prices?)

The only problem about Mixto is the location. Why? It&#39;s located in one of the busiest sections of Silver Lake--right across from the insane Trader Joe&#39;s parking lot and near the intersection of Hyperion and Rowena. (If you have driven around this area, you know exactly what I&#39;m talking about!!!). Plus, they have a somewhat smallish parking lot, though I never encountered issues with finding a spot. But, other than this, Mixto is great! 

Oh! I forgot to mention that they have a handicapped parking space where a person with a disability can order their meal without ever having to leaving their vehicle. (It&#39;s like one of those ordering things found at a drive-thru). So convenient. :)

I love this place!"

Mixto is a mixed bag. It certainly seems healthier than other taco stands (my assumption based on the premium protein options: grass-fed carne asada, free-range chicken, premium pork (whatever that is: Wilbur?)). 

Yesterday we ordered a carne asada burrito, the premium pork bowl and a couple of tacos: fish and carne asada. We were all hungry, and while filling, all items were across-the-board underwhelming: just bland. Even with salsa (so weird). The fish taco: fishy smelly and bland. The asada: tender but bland. The pork: bland bland. We don&#39;t cook with a lot of salt, and eat healthy 90% of the time. Something seemed like it was seriously missing from all our selections. I guess it was just flavor. Except the guacamole - too too much citrus. I was excited for that first bite (as all guacamole eaters typically are) - but the citrus killed the avocado flavor completely. I actually scraped off the rest (when does anyone remove guacamole from anything??) It wasn&#39;t all bad, the chips were really good. The aqua frescas were unique - my family liked them - but too artisanal for my taste."

It is a cool little place and it does have parking up behind the building but it&#39;s only a couple of spots. The guy who took my order was nice and very helpful. I beat the lunch rush so my food came out in no time at all. But the tacos were just ok. I know what you may be thinking, &#34;it&#39;s just a taco&#34;. But now having been in LA for 10 years and having tried more taco trucks and stands than I thought possible I know the difference. Oddly enough everything was really fresh. After much thought I think I nailed it down to the tortilla. I just didn&#39;t like the taste. So I m going to give it another try I will be ordering something else next time. I will let you know how it goes."

The kale salad is fresh and delicious and so is the guac!  The fish taco is grilled on a delicious tortilla and is around $3.25 which I think is reasonable!

there are a lot of mixed reviews about this place which surprises me since my experiences have been all good.  there are plenty more things on the menu I&#39;d like to try so I&#39;ll definitely be back"

The Carne Asada bowl is delicious and you can taste the quality of the ingredients. It has mixed greens, caramelized onions, avocado, a little cream, and it works very well together. 
I feel shorted with the meat when ordering a quesadilla, sometimes it&#39;s only been 3 or 4 strips of small beef. Other times it has been average. The Chicken Torta is also unsatisfying as they are only putting 4 or 5 microscopic pieces of their &#34;pickled onion&#34; on the bread which is not satisfying in its own. 
Stick with the bowls and you&#39;ll be fine. If Mixto was priced lower I&#39;d be here a lot more, as I am often still hungry after the meal."

Wacala!- Soyrizo was absolute excrement, or in this case Mexcrement. I think on a good day, this place would be better. I think whomever said this was &#34;Chipotle for Hipsters&#34; nailed it.

I got the mild salsa but it still got dry around the half way mark. You can ask for extra salsa but they will remind you only one per order. Why so stingy? They give away water in the seating area which is a scarce resource why horde the salsa? #MakesNoSense.

The chicken bowl suffered from the same lack of salsa. When I picked up the guy said it was already added. Last time I had to ask for salsa and was given it in a container, so who knows what&#39;s going on here. Is it in the bowl or is it not?!

Kale Caesar with added chicken has been my &#34;usual&#34; for years. However if I was feeling really hungry, I&#39;d order an asada torta and a Kale Caesar to go and pick it at all day. Something about the torta was just so fresh and when smothered with citrus habanero..oh man!!! I was heartbroken to find out it&#39;s no longer a menu item :( I&#39;ll miss you, torta.

The chips were really fresh - nice and crispy but not overly greasy. Also, just the right amount of salt. Since my boyfriend makes tortilla chips at home, I have a pretty high standard now but Mixto passes with flying colors! 

The salsa, on the other hand, is NO laughing matter. I can handle heat and this baby had all my sinuses arunnin&#39;! SO good. It was kind of like their tomatillo salsa + little flecks of Habanero pepper. FUEGO!"

I would never ever drive out of the way to come here, but if you live in the area I think it&#39;s a good spot to satisfy your Mexican fusion craving. The portions are average sized, and the taste is also pretty average. I got one of their chicken bowls and felt that it needed a LOT of sauce/salsa to improve its flavor. Otherwise a bit bland to me. 

I think they could do a better marinade for the meats and give a little more umph to their bowls in terms of flavor. It wasn&#39;t memorable and it wasn&#39;t awful. Just OK, but worth trying at least once to see if it suits your appetite. 

We live in the area so maybe we&#39;ll be back. It&#39;s just not a 4-Yelp star worthy joint in my opinion, though we appreciate that this restaurant exists among the other overpriced hipster ones..."

As other reviewers mentioned, the prices went up which is disappointing but also predictable over the course of business. However, the price should never go up right at the same time that the quality of the food drops. My boyfriend and I live on the block, and have eaten here at least twice a week on average over the course of the last three years. 9 times out of 10, we order the chicken. (Sometimes, I ordered just a side of chicken - it was that good.) Unfortunately, they just changed their chicken recipe, and what used to be really delicious and tender stewed, shredded organic chicken now is the most boring, bland cubed chicken you can get almost anywhere else. No more juicy chicken bowl to eat while I watch X-Files. No more tasty chicken burrito to dream about all night. No more perfect chicken tacos to share with my cats.

If you have a new cook, Mixto, they are failing you. And yes, the crabby new cashier guy sucks, too. :&#39;("

As many other recent reviewers have said, Mixto is messing with what was a fantastic thing and have now lost us as customers. This pains me so much to say, but as we painstakingly tried two different versions of this chicken salad, we came to the conclusion that it will never be the same. 

Hopefully, Mixto is reading these reviews and considering going back to what won them all of their business in the first place. When we asked why the changes to the menu have been made we were told it was the owners choice. BAD MOVE.

The food here is organic, and the flavor definitely shows. The prices are a little higher than most other taco places, but the quality is well-worth the price.
Parking is at the back of the building, or you can find parking along Hyperion. They have one restroom, which is well stocked and clean. 
They have all sorts of Mexican food here, of which I picked the carne asada tacos and the chicken tacos. I also ordered a water, which came is a box. The wait was not too long, less than 5 minutes to get my food. The food was delicious, and their habanero sauce is pretty spicy. I think the boxed water was intriguing, especially the slogan on it, &#34;boxed water is better.&#34;

When I pick it up, its ready on time and they help with to my car. 

The parking is a little weird (behind the building) but usually not full. 

I highly recommend it for large lunch ordering!"

I&#39;ve made some rather complicated online orders...remove this and this, add this and this and this. They&#39;ve yet to make a mistake. Delivery times can differ drastically depending on the day/time. Busy nights it&#39;s taken over an hour, other times super fast, like 10-15 minutes! Regardless, the food has always still been hot. If they anticipate delivery to take over an hour, they call and give you a head&#39;s up.

I&#39;m vegan so I go with the soy chorizo burrito (already vegan) or the soy chorizo taco (omit the cream and cheese). The burrito is huge and the tacos are pretty big, too. I&#39;m not super into carmelized onion so I get diced red onion instead. I like to add double avocado, like a boss. Yum! The plantains are delish! The horchata is vegan and delightful!

The habanero salsa ain&#39;t messin&#39; around! Personally I recommend the habanero salsa for adding to your taco/burrito (if you like spicy), and the mild salsas for chip dipping (if you don&#39;t want tears running down your face). The guacamole tends to be on the limey side but is fresh and creamy. Love that this food gets delivered to my doorstep when I&#39;m lazy!!! And it&#39;s open late!"

I placed an order online here for our office: a good six orders. After 20 minutes I came to pickup. And after another 10 minutes of searching for parking I managed to snag a spot on Monon St. Parking here is particularly atrocious. Between the trader joe&#39;s, and gelson&#39;s this is a heavy trafficked area and Hyperion is a busy street. In short: get delivery of you can. 

The pickup itself was fairly straightforward: I bypassed the line and went right to the pickup window. All of our items were labeled, and I had prepared so I was able to grab out burritos then journey back to my car. 

The chile relleno burrito will no doubt lure me back here as it is the perfect mix of spiciness, and cheesiness. Plus it is quite filling. I highly recommend giving it a try! You won&#39;t regret it!"

mixto is rad because it&#39;s another neighborhood convenience for me.  They do have delivery for those sad hangover days though.  
I generally get the chicken bowl or veggie, easy on the rice though.  Then i realized the steak bowl has zero rice so I stepped my game up.
This is a rare place where I may actually order a beverage other than water.  They have a tasty almond horchata. mmmm. I want one right now.  They also have bombastic looking zerts on display..I caved once when I was having a mad key lime pie craving.  Luckily the display is where you pick up your food and not order it, otherwise the temptation would be too much for my weak soul to handle.

I have been coming here for years and the food and service are good. There is usually a line later in the day, but don&#39;t expect to wait for more than five minutes. My main gripe with Mixto is one of my favorite items to get; the carne asada burrito has gone down hill over this past year. It originally had brown rice and now has yellow rice, which tastes bland. I enjoy the whole wheat tortilla and quality grass fed beef that is used in their burrito but the yellow rice (turmeric I believe) ruins this burrito. Everything else on the menu is great. I recommend the chicken tacos and kale salad. Overall a great healthy alternative to a city that is inundated with taco stands."

A simple mixed green salad with optional Carne Asada- this was my favorite thing. It&#39;s so simple to make and delicious, how can they not offer it, even on the downlow? what&#39;s up with that guys- did you forget how to make it?

I will never understand why you&#39;d want to mess with a perfectly good menu, but they did. Maybe others will brave the tricky rear parking lot for the current cuisine, but I will definitely be cutting back now that they took my favorite meat salad away... otherwise 4-5 stars."

Ordered online and had my hubby pick it up on way home. He cannot handle greasy, or fried foods, so I found this place one Yelp as an alternative to my love for Mexican lol. 

His chicken bowl ( $8) was small but extremely filling. Was filled with delicious chicken, lettuce, rice, beans etc. He said it only lacked spicyness but Tapatio saved the day lol. Also ordered him 2 homemade wheat tortillas ($.50 each) which he used to make little burritos lol. 

I ordered everything else haha. Wanted to try the tacos so got a Carne Asada ($3+) (good meat not at all greash but lacking in spice) one. A Soy Chorizo  (my fav but super spicy) and a fish taco (not my favorite but very light but lacked flavor to me) and Plata nod Maduros. Loved the plantains w/sour cream (a heavy, thick, creamy kind not at all store kind) which I had for breakfast today. Yum! And loved my soy chorizo taco but I had to use some of my sour cream to calm it down for me. Will order again.

Not that I didn&#39;t enjoy the Watermelon Basil Agua Fresca. It was very tasty and refreshing. But I couldn&#39;t really taste the watermelon unlike the Watermelon Fresca served at Native Foods which I love. This one reminded me more like lemonade. Still good though :) http://bit.ly/1gJUnzH

This was the perfect spot for post-hike eats. It accommodated four meateaters and vegan me. Finding it was easy and we lucked out with spots for our three cars in the tiny parking lot behind the building. This place is basically a food stand with a charming indoor-ish yet outdoor-ish dining area.

The meateaters in our group had their free-range chicken or grass-fed carne asada in taco, burrito, or bowl form. But I was happy that this place had stuff for me too :)

I had a Soy Chorizo Taco with sautéed onion and yellow pepper (sans cheese and cream). This had some kick to it. I&#39;m not sure if it was the soy chorizo or the salsa but I liked the spicy. http://bit.ly/Pd3dv2

I also had the Mixed Vegetable Taco with black beans, caramelized onions, chiles and mushrooms. (Again, no cheese and cream for me.) Yum! http://bit.ly/1lkgAoa

Great food for foodies. If you&#39;re expecting greasy spoon family style Mexican,  this isn&#39;t that place. Fresh organic ingredients with a modern twist have kept me coming back at least three times a week since they opened. Yum yum yum. The salads are delicious. The bowls are the bomb. The tacos never disappoint. And they have zero calorie Virgil&#39;s soda!

Minus one star because they say add-on chicken is 6oz but twice I&#39;ve measured on my food scale and it only came out to 2.5 to 3 ounces cooked which means it&#39;s only about 4-4.5 ounces raw. Still fills you up, but if you&#39;re counting your macros, you need to know this for accuracy ."

Parking is never a problem in the back. 

Tacos were good the first time- the premium pork, second time-it was dry...so maybe there&#39;s a little inconsistency there?

I got the Carne Asada bowl which was tasty but the portions were on the small side.  Meaning you&#39;ll need to order something else if this is a meal.

Kale Caesar...ok I understand this is a very popular item and people love this.  Probably because the portion is so overly generous that people assume it&#39;s a deal.  But let&#39;s not forget that this is not a Caesar salad.  It&#39;s Kale with lemon vinaigrette.  There was no parmesan either and I didn&#39;t taste anchovies or garlic in the dressing.  So if you want Kale with tart lemon dressing, do it.
Guacamole was meh...average but I didn&#39;t see or taste any cilantro.  C&#39;mon, TJ&#39;s is right across the street, don&#39;t cheat!"

I&#39;ve been driving past this place for years, on the way to TJs or passing through Silverlake. 

I got there a little after 1:30pm and it was pretty busy- you order from the side of their building and pick up the food on the other side which is covered and has a few tables and counter height seating area. It was bright and clean which I liked, I wish they had more 2 person tables because all single people who were dropping by for lunch took the 4 seat tables each...leaving the rest of us stranded.

I ordered 2 tacos- the carnitas and the chicken- I got the medium spicy sauce on both (forgot what it&#39;s called, it started with an m and it was like a pico de gallo). I thought the pork taco was great, the carnitas were a little salty, but I loved the pickled onions and avocado- anything with avocado is a love situation. It was slightly greasy as most pork dishes are, I had grease dripping down into my little tray as I was eating...bliss. The chicken taco was not as good as the pork but only because I think the pork had more flavor. The tortillas were great, they tasted fresh and not just out of a bag.

I was also excited about the dairy free horchata since I love horchata and I&#39;m lactose intolerant! That made my day :)

I will definitely be back to try the kale salad everyone keeps raving about and the torta sounds pretty damn good too."

We ordered 2 of the mixto breakfast burritos with carne and 2 drinks (horchata &amp; watermelon Aqua Fresca).  It came out to about $27.  It was good but very plain healthy tasting.  And they forgot to put the salsa in the bag (we got it to go) so maybe it would have tasted better with that on it. It&#39;s also suppose to come with cheese inside and I didn&#39;t taste any at all.  I didn&#39;t like the horchata it was very chalky I like mine smooth.  The watermelon Aqua Fresca wasn&#39;t bad but very small for almost $4.  The place is literally just a little shack.  We went on a Friday night and there was a line.  Everyone was ordering tacos maybe their tacos are better than their breakfast burrito.

I ordered the carne asada burrito and my table split a kale salad and a horchata. The kale salad was extremely tasty and a really large portion and it had a really nice dressing. I would definitely recommend getting it. The burrito was a little bit smaller than I expected and I didn&#39;t realize that it didn&#39;t come with cheese which surprised me. The steak was really well cooked and not fatty pieces like other burrito locations. The burrito was alright, the salad was incredible and the horchata added the final touches to a nice place.

The food is always very good and the employees are great also. The food can be a little bit pricey, but I always come back because it&#39;s convenient and healthier than your normal Mexican food. 

The last time I ate there will be my last. Unfortunately, we found a rubber band in one of the chicken tacos we ordered. Although the food was delicious as always, I was very concerned finding a rubber band in my food. When I brought it to an employees attention, he just said, &#34;I&#39;m not trying to make an excuse, but that rubber band comes from our produce.&#34; Thank you, I feel so much better now knowing it was only from the produce! He did not offer me a reimbursement or another taco, he just left it at that. I was pretty disappointed after my last experience."

Ok, the super long line here doesn&#39;t help. Or the fact that it&#39;s cash only. But some out-of-town friends wanted some good food in DTLA and I only knew of one place that could fit the bill!

So of course, having never been to this location before but knowing that it&#39;s delicious, I ordered the standard Daikoku Ramen to see how it stacks up against its Sawtelle location. Well, it is just as good and exactly what I expected out of Daikokuya. The noodles, broth, and pork are all top-notch, you will not find much better out there. If you want some super bomb tonkotsu ramen, this ramen bowl will certainly make you satisfied.

Normally there&#39;s a pretty large amount of people outside, offputting enough to make me not want to come here. Oddly for us though, there was not much of a line on the Friday that I came here. Either way, I wasn&#39;t complaining. I&#39;d definitely come back more often if I could avoid the long wait times.

Overall, the Little Tokyo location is on par with the Sawtelle location. I only give the edge to Sawtelle simply because they take cards while Little Tokyo is cash only. Aside from that, they are both equally as good in my book for all intents and purposes."

Don&#39;t forget to put your name on the sign-in sheet upon arrival! We ordered a Spicy Miso, a Daikoku (w/ kotteri flavor), and the Tsukemono (pickled veggies). The tsukemono was pretty great, interesting vegetables and the sesame seeds sprinkled on top were a nice touch. The Spicy Miso was likely the best spicy broth I&#39;ve ever had. Great body and not overly spicy. The pork in mine had a strong pork aftertaste which was a little jarring, but I&#39;ll chalk it up to that particular slice as the pork in the Daikoku was just fine. The Daikoku broth with kotteri flavor was out of this world. So much complexity in the broth. Noodles in both were great and the soft-boiled eggs were wonderfully gooey. I&#39;d be interested to try other ramen places in Little Tokyo for comparison, but the broth here is what really stood out to me."

Usually when we walk past, there is a line out the door and down the sidewalk and we just don&#39;t have time to wait. Awesomely enough, this time there was ZERO line and we were able to be seated immediately if we sat at the counter. We took the hostess up on that offer, not wanting to wait around for a table. 

This turned out to be a mistake. The corner I stupidly chose to sit in was very warm, my stool was wobbly, and there was a cloudy glass panel right in front of my face. The counter did not have much space for food which I should have considered before we sat down. 

Our waitress was very nice (and spoke Japanese, which was nice!) but seemed to be in quite a hurry, presumably to get everyone out the door before the dinner rush came. In turn, we felt a bit rushed. It was also VERY difficult to get our server&#39;s attention for anything. For instance, my BF ordered extra bean sprouts but they brought bamboo instead and it took quite awhile to get someone&#39;s attention so that we could get the correct vegetable. 

The food was pretty decent! I will admit that it is not the best ramen I have ever had, though. The gyoza was very strange. They were all cooked together into something that resembled a patty or omelette and were topped with green onions. They were pretty tasty but the presentation was odd and some of them ripped open as we tried to tear them apart. 

If I had to rate the ramen on a scale of 1-5, I would give it a 3. I do like that you can order a half portion because I can never finish a full size bowl of ramen. The broth a noodles were decent. I loved the sweet corn that came in it and even asked for extra. The egg (a miso egg, I believe) had to be my favorite part, though. I was a bit skeptical because when I first went to bite into it, I noticed that it was cold. I let it sit in the broth for a bit and it was good to go. The yolk was gooey and absolutely delicious. 

Overall, we had an okay experience. I wasn&#39;t blown away but it wasn&#39;t terrible either. We may be back or we may not."

I was in town for a convention, and I wanted to try Ramen down here, so my sister and I decided to check this out. Every time I&#39;ve passed by there&#39;s always a line. When we visited, we only had to wait about 30 minutes. Located across the main shopping center in Little Tokyo, you&#39;ll find this restaurant. It&#39;s not too big, a bar on one side, a couple booths on the other. Once we were in, we were greeted by one of the nicest waiters I&#39;ve seen in a while. I forgot his name, but he seemed very enthusiastic about his work.

Today, I ordered the Daikoku Ramen, Gyoza, and a beer. It didn&#39;t take much time for everything to roll out. The Gyoza was delicious. First time where I&#39;ve seen it fried in whatever that was, cheese? Probably not, but they were unique. Make sure you have it with the sauce they provide! 

The Daikoku Ramen was very rich and filling. I&#39;m a big fan of tonkatsu flavored broths and this was exceptional. The broth was &#39;thicker&#39; than what I was accustomed to, but it was unique and welcomed. The noodles were firm. Porkbelly was delicious. And the rest all formed a good dish.

Whenever I&#39;m in the mood for Ramen when I&#39;m in town, I will definitely come back."

This restaurant isn&#39;t meant for big parties, so seating can be a little cramped and the restaurant itself is rather small as well.

I recommend the Shoyu and the Spicy Miso ramen. Both are delicious! Spicy Miso&#39;s broth was savory and you can ask for it to be thick and fatty as well. The Shoyu was a little bit salty for me, but it was still good. You can do a half order for that if you feel that the regular size bowl is too big. The bowls are huge, and definitely worth the money!"

We were starving. We put our names down on the waitlist around 12:30am and they said they would still seat us! We ended up being seated a little after 1am. They close at 1am.

I ordered the Daikoku Ramen and thought it was delicoius! The broth is pretty heavy, but the flavor is not too salty. The noodles were cooked perfectly. It comes with a whole egg and bamboo! Two things I love in my ramen. The meat was so tender and flavorful. I loved it.

Service was good even though we were seated so late.

They have small mugs of Sapporo for $2.50! I think it was Sapporo, I might be mistaken."

Two names popped up repeatedly while doing some cursory research on ramen, especially since I was staying in Little Tokyo: Daikokuya and Shinsengumi.  While walking around, it was decided to judge books by their covers, and Shinsengumi&#39;s modernized facade shared with a Quiznos and a Starbucks wasn&#39;t as charming or promising looking as Daikokuya&#39;s hole-in-the-wall appearance, not to mention the huge group of people all waiting to get in.  So we decided to put our name on the list and wait out Daikokuya, which was fine by me since I&#39;d been drinking and a little time to sober up and play Pokemon Go sounded appealing.

You learn a lot about human behavior when waiting in a long line; for starters, if you think anyone is going to put your name down on the list for you, you&#39;re in for disappointment; thankfully I noticed only one person write their name down after me before I realized that I have to do it myself.  The way it works is that after you put your name down, you simply wait and hope to have Beethoven&#39;s hearing aid when a server will eventually softly call for your name, and quickly respond before you are deemed as &#34;called&#34; and passed over.  But, if you hear your name and respond, it&#39;s cool, otherwise, you can be a salty patron and let a hostess know &#34;we&#39;ve been here the whole time.&#34;

Anyway, after around a 40 minute wait, my name was called, and the gf and I were seated in a cozy booth.  Once seated, service is prompt, efficient, and moves like a well-oiled machine; after all, with 40 minute waits, it&#39;s definitely in their best interest to get you in, get you fed and get you out as efficiently as possible.

We both ordered the Daikoku ramen, since it&#39;s the headline item, and what looks like the iconic item of the restaurant. To no real surprise, it came pretty quickly, as I have to imagine that with the sheer volume of ramen that gets ordered, there&#39;s probably a massive amount in ready for orders.

The broth is savory and meaty in flavor, and I appreciate that they don&#39;t skimp on choshu.  The portion is pretty generous in size, as well as how much stuff like bamboo shoots and the volume of noodles you get inside of it.

Overall, I have to say that I can&#39;t say that I was super impressed with the ramen, though.  For as long as I waited, I would have hoped to have gotten something a little more memorable, but in all honesty, it wasn&#39;t mind-blowing or differing to separate itself from the pack.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, it&#39;s still hearty and good quality ramen, but I waited like 45 minutes and hoped for something along the lines of Ippudo and very much didn&#39;t.

The location is charming and pleasant and the service is fast, polite and efficient.  I wouldn&#39;t say the food is worth waiting 45+ minutes for, but if by chance you go there and there&#39;s not a long wait, then it&#39;s probably an experience better than 3 stars waiting for you than it was for me."

Food
-tonkatsu ramen- yum, standard ramen but the broth is really rich and delicious. The meat is tender and I was really full by the end of it. 
-Oyako Don- delicious! Love how they have ramen and rice bowl combinations. Destroyed this rice bowl right away. 

Service
-so apparently they have a policy where you need everyone to be seated. Someone in our party was running late and this fobby looking female waiter was making a big deal out of it. Luckily, this other guy who was a lot more chill let us stay and took our orders. Besides that, service is fine. 

Environment- super crowded and there&#39;s not much seating. Not the best place for large parties and expect to wait during busy times.

Got here around 3pm, and even so, there was a 30 minute wait for my boyfriend and I. I was glad to be able to sit down in that timeframe as we had our flight to catch that evening and I wanted to eat here from all the raves i heard.

The dishes come out so quickly which is really nice! I ordered the spicy miso ramen and my boyfriend ordered the traditional tonkotsu. Both were so delicious and rich in flavor. I wish the pork belly slice was a bit thicker, but still tasted great. I love the ajitsuki eggs.

It&#39;s really a dine in, and get out type of restaurant as it&#39;s a really popular place and they want to serve as many people as possible. Definitely one of my favorites"

We came in around 2:30 on a Sunday and there were 12 parties ahead of us.. I knew there would probably be a wait but hollyyy. The inside seemed pretty small at first, but they could actually fit a decent amount of people in there (avoid coming in big groups though, all they have is booths and bar seating). Also, I don&#39;t think there was working AC, just fans. However, it still felt better instead than it did outside for sure. After some debating on whether we should wait or go some place else, we decided to just wait it out. It only took about 20-30 minutes, since their service was on top of it and really great at getting people in and out.

I ordered the Daikoku ramen with the kotteri flavor and my bf got the spicy miso. The food came out pretty fast and I was really pleased with both flavors. Mine was a little greasy, probably due to the kotteri, but nothing unbearable. The flavor was amazing, I love creamy broths in my ramen and this one hit the mark for me completely. Also loved how the chashu wasn&#39;t super fatty like how it usually is. I&#39;m not really a fan of fatty meats so I was super pleased with that as well. The spicy miso was pretty different from any other spicy miso I&#39;ve tried, but in a good way. It had a really unique flavor, less creamy than the Daikoku, but still really wonderful. 

Overall, I&#39;m really glad we decided to stay and wait. It actually didn&#39;t even seem that long because during that time, I noticed one of the CASH ONLY signs and we decided to go the Nijiya market in the Japanese Village to get cash back after finding out there was no atm. SUPER SMART IDEA if you don&#39;t want to pay the fee they&#39;ll charge you if you use their atm in the back of the store (since there&#39;s no other atms around besides citi bank). But yes, very important that it&#39;s cash only so come prepared people!! Anyways, really great food and really great service, I&#39;ll definitely be checking out the Monterey Park location soon since it&#39;s way closer for me.

Also side note, the parking sucks but surprise surprise that&#39;s LA for you. I ended up parking in the Japanese Village parking structure for $10. But then again, I&#39;m pretty unfamiliar with the area so maybe there are better options available for parking. If you know of any, please let me know!"

On a Sunday night at 8:30 it was only a 20 minute wait for four people. 

I got the spicy miso ramen combo with ikura bowl. I devoured everything because it was so good! The only thing is I wish the noodles were more firm but other than that there was nothing to complain about. Everything came out pretty fast too. 

Overall would definitely come back if I was in the area and craving ramen if the wait wasn&#39;t too long!"

The spicy miso ramen WAS good, but I&#39;ve definitely had better. I was expecting more, especially after having to wait 2.5 hours on an empty stomach.

I suggest you put your name down and walk around Little Tokyo if it&#39;s a late night; just standing there out front can make the wait seem like forever and a day."

It was the first and only ramen shop I visited when i stopped in LA. There was a wait and we signed in. We waited about an hour. I always think lines are indicative of how the food will taste. People don&#39;t stand in line for mediocre food. While waiting, I noticed the interior looked old, but it had a traditional japanese feel to it.

SPICY TUNA ROLL- avocado and tuna
This roll was very fresh and had a nice creamy texture. There was a nice hint of spice to the tuna. It was a very simple roll, but it was packed with fresh flavors.

SALMON SASHIMI- raw salmon and radish shavings
The salmon was very fresh and had a nice smooth buttery consistency. The pieces were cut very thick, which is always a plus.

GYOZA- pan-fried dumplings with a mix of pork and vegetables
The gyozas were very crispy. Just one bite into it I could tell that it was freshly made. There was an even portion and ratio of pork to vegetables. Even though it tasted homemade it lacked flavor. There was nothing special about this dish. It was just a typical dish of gyozas. It failed to wow me. Overall this dish was bland and could&#39;ve used more seasoning.

SLICED ROAST PORK- seared kurobuta pork belly chashu with sweet glaze and green onions
The roast pork was very meaty and had a sweetness to it due to the glaze. I only wish that it had more fatness to it. The green onions were a nice addition because it added a little bit of a crisp and texture difference. This dish was okay. It was really heavy and the flavors were more sweet than anything.

DAIKOKU RAMEN- boiled chijire style egg noodles, kurobuta pork belly chashu, marinated boiled egg, bean sprouts, green onions, and a sprinkle of sesame seeds infused with blended soy sauce
The ramen itself was a disappointment. I didn&#39;t like it too much. The broth was simple. I was expecting to get hit with flavor, but it was so basic. The broth was neither sweet nor savory, the cuts of chashu was very meaty and tough, and the egg was marinated nicely, but I&#39;ve had better eggs elsewhere. 

Overall, I don&#39;t understand the hype. I give a solid 2.5 rating. The service was okay, the wait would&#39;ve been worth it if the food was up to par, the establishment is a bit rundown and the food could&#39;ve been better. I&#39;ll stick to Houston with this one."

Best Ramen spot i&#39;ve been to in LA/OC area. This place was packed for a Tuesday lunch. We waited about 20-30 minutes or so. The place is pretty small with limited group seating and then theres a bar for singles or doubles or any group that doesn&#39;t mind not facing each other.

After we were finally seated, the server quickly took our orders. Service wasn&#39;t very phenomenal but the standard. Can&#39;t really complain.

I ended up getting the Spicy Miso Ramen with extra bamboo shoot. The broth was very rich in flavor. The ramen was cooked to perfection (not soggy, not hard, just perfect al dente - is this the correct term for ramen noodle?). I asked for a side of hot chili oil so I can make my ramen spicier. It was definitely needed since spicy didn&#39;t really mean spicy in my opinion.

If you happen to find yourself in Little Tokyo and want noodles, definitely check this spot out!"

We took a late morning jaunt to Little Tokyo on the advice and suggestion of our hotel concierge and found Daikokuya on Yelp and decidedly headed towards it with high hopes. As soon as we rolled up onto it we saw the massive crowd and had second thoughts. But, when ramen is on the brain there&#39;s not much you can do! 

This place is downright old school. There is nostalgic memorabilia on the walls and vintage Japanese music squawking through the speakers. Upon walking in I was reminded of the ramen establishments that I frequent in NYC. Tight and narrow quarters with the kitchen located all the way in the back near the restrooms. There are only a handful of booths and a bar-style section with over a dozen stools. 

You simply write your name down on a pad and you&#39;d better be standing nearby or risk missing your spot. I witnessed twice when the hostess called names and the diners were nowhere to be found. You snooze? You lose! We waited over an hour and I was told by a random passerby that this was *the* place for ramen on the block. We patiently waited while dreaming of ramen noodles swimming in rich broth amongst pork and other accoutrements. 

We were served:

- Gyoza
- Octupus Balls
- Eel
- Bento box
- Spicy Ramen
- Mison Ramen
- Mison Ramen Combo

Two things I look for in ramen are chewiness of the noodles and of course, the broth. The broth was not bold and overpowering, but clearly flavorful. On the other hand, I would&#39;ve given 5 stars if the noodles were not cooked as long. The noodles should have some &#34;spring&#34;, but also have a slightly chewy nature to them. The pork was tender and had just the right amount of fatty factor for a nice complement. Where&#39;s the egg? Oh, there it is!

My wife and son commented that they were pleased with their ramen as well. My daughter had the bento box and it was impressive in terms of portion. She couldn&#39;t finish it all, so her old man partook in the leftovers. Oh, did I forget to comment on the apps? Not a big fan of eel or octupus balls, so can&#39;t comment there. However, the gyoza was par with my expectations and I enjoyed it. All the servings came out within 10 minutes of ordering.

Is it worth the wait? I most certainly think so. Downsides? As I mentioned before it&#39;s not a large establishment, so waiting for your table can be a bit inconvenient. Overall, the service was good and during my visit there were only two servers who covered the entire restaurant. Have I had better ramen? Probably, but in NYC. But, to each his | her own. Let&#39;s all eat more ramen!"

If you come here, get the Daikoku Ramen AND get the kotteri (extra fat from the back). I tasted both the regular broth and the kotteri and the latter is so much more rich and hearty. It makes you go aahhhhh.

I like that I&#39;m paying $9.95 for a solid bowl of ramen. Every bit of it is was quality. Even the cha shu (which doesn&#39;t get a chance to warm up) was tender and noodles were bouncy. The egg was cooked slightly over soft-boiled which I actually appreciated. Sometimes I don&#39;t like the goo running into my broth.

The waitlist can look daunting but the actual wait itself isn&#39;t too bad. People eat ramen pretty quickly. If you&#39;re dying, there&#39;s a Family Mart a few stores down for you to replenish your body with (drinks, food, a/c)."

The place is just way too small and the wait in line is just going to forever be there since it&#39;s popular and well-known.  You must put in your name and number of people in your groupie.  A party of 4 would be your biggest groupie you could dine with.  Our groupie waited for about 45 minutes.  I guess it feels like Japan - super crowded and a lot of hustling and bustling going on.  You just have to eat and jet and no time to jibber jabber about your yacht life.  A few tables and booths and a tiny bar fill up some square footage.  Be careful walking to the restroom because you can easily slip on that slippery tile.  

The Daikoku ramen is a tonkatsu soup base (what they are known for) filled with bean sprouts, bamboo shoots, green onions, a soft boiled egg, and 2 slices of kurobuta pork belly.  The soup base was good, but not the best I&#39;ve ever had.  The egg white texture was too soft for my liking.  The pork belly felt like it was way too crumbly versus tender for a pork belly.  It lost some of that rich flavor and texture because it was sitting too long in water kind of feeling.  The same feeling like your skin turning wrinkly from sitting in the pool for too long. However, the egg noodles were cooked to a perfect firmness.  

My expectations were too high, but I&#39;m glad I was able to try it at least once.  It wasn&#39;t too bad, but not the best.  Check please.  Going to yacht it up."

And unfortunately, this is one of those rare occasions where I&#39;m disappointed (although somewhat glad) to say that Toronto does it better. 

Yes the noodles are good, they have a superb bounce, giving it a firm, satisfying bite. 
The char su is amazing. Melt in your mouth, filled with delicious pork flavour. 
These were the two things that impressed me. 
After this, while the broth is flavourful, it is hardly as rich as some of the broths up in Toronto, it&#39;s a little bit too watery so it does not cling to the noodles well, leaving the noodles with a bland taste. You get around this by drinking some with each bite of noodle, but it&#39;s not the same. 
The other disappointment was the egg, unfortunately I usually expect a gooey, semi liquid yolk with my ramen eggs, this was was just a little shy of hard boiled where the yolk started to get opaque. 

Overall this is a good ramen shop, Toronto does it better. I personally would not wait over 15mins for this again."

The Bento box is huge and our waitress did an amazing job packaging up my leftovers in tiny little styrofoam containers so when I opened it up it looked so beautiful you couldn&#39;t tell it was left overs. 

The Ramen really is good here and so plentiful and filling.   The miso just makes me sigh, it&#39;s just right. This place has that home cooked taste and feeling.

After eating I was waiting out front and a little Japanese man was excitedly running around trying to get a picture in front of the restaurant by a passerbyer.  He was so excited that he was finally here he ran up to me to show the picture of him standing in front of the restaurant. I asked him where he was from and he said, &#34;here!&#34; He reminded me of those Japanese cartoon characters that are jumping up and down and he had come to life right in front of me then he disappeared just as quickly and excitedly as he ran into the restaurant.

It was past 10 p.m. on a week night. Would I wait for 45 minutes or longer for it again? No. It was good but not outstanding, but it was very comparable to Shinshengumi.

I found this place through several reviews on LA&#39;s best ramen and Japanese food. The line up they had was also very noticeable!

Ramen is indeed very good. Noodles are bouncy and the broth is very rich and hearty. I tried the Daikoku vs Kotteri flavour (added soup extracted from back fat, AKA fattier broth) and I HIGHLY recommend asking for Kotteri! There really is a difference between the two broths. Kotteri, the fattier broth, is creamier, richer, and has more depth to it. There&#39;s much more flavour packed into it and it&#39;s so much more satisfying! The broth here is actually less salty than other places as well (it still is salty but slightly less!) which was a nice surprise. I often find many places having way too much salt that it makes the ramen sickening to eat. Ramen noodles are thick and bouncy which I absolutely love. Toppings on the ramen are also great, very loaded! Egg was also well marinated with an oozing yolk.

Takoyaki was fantastic, perfectly crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Cold Ramen was quite good too, although it&#39;s not for everyone as the broth is different. The broth is a little sour and spicy, and very cold as there are ice cubes in it. Some might not like the flavour or style of it, but the noodles are still good! It&#39;s a very refreshing alternative to those who don&#39;t want a hearty bowl of ramen. 

Great place to eat and definitely a place to get your ramen fix. Left full and satisfied and they have quality ramen.

The ramen&#39;s broth is so rich and delicious.  And their pork belly is melt in your mouth.  Note: our friend ordered an extra side of pork belly, it comes to the table cold - so be sure to throw it into you broth asap to warm it.

So we tried again... we got lucky that the line wasn&#39;t that bad. We read a few manga while waiting inside.

Then came our order. I think it was a bad day at the kitchen. The fried rice was too salty and the ramen was, to be totally honest, was horrible. The broth was oily, the noodles were gummy and stuck together, and there was no taste. I was blown away at how bad it was.

Decided to try the spicy miso ramen. It&#39;s a great combo with the spicy tuna. I was surprised at how good the spicy tuna roll was! Also had their cold sake (forgot the name) but it was dry and smooth. I think the bottle label was in blue ... lol hope that helps!"

There was a salad that came along with it and was the perfect amount of dressing and was very light (which was great) 

I got the shredded pork bowl which was delicious and had plenty of pork, saucy, green onions. Be I kinda which the combination had this as the large and the ramen was smaller.   Also got the tuna tartare bowl - good - can&#39;t go wrong if you have good ingredients.

The tsukemen was pretty satisfying; the noodles were great. The egg was just right with the yolk still soft. The pork slices broke apart easily, perhaps a bit too tender. The broth was good, but it did leave me with a bit of a lingering salty aftertaste. Fortunately, not one of those dreaded MSG hangovers, just slightly unpleasant feeling for a couple hours.

The price is very affordable under 10$ for a meal is always a great deal. The ramen is amazing. I can&#39;t describe it but just think thick salty soup which is not a great description but it is really good. 

Service is on the rush side but understandably so. They are always packed with a line out the door. 

Decor is set up like a traditional Japanese ramen shop like those you would see in anime or Japanese tv dramas. It&#39;s small and bustling. 

Try many of the side dishes. The main thing is of course the ramen but the sides are fairly cheap and usually can discover something new you like.

Things started off bad instantly, when the waitress put the miso soup on our table, which is so broken it&#39;s rocking around like a rocking chair, and then proceeds to spill half of the miso without given a single crap, and walks away. No attempt to clean it or fix the unbearably broken taken.

The ramen broth itself was nothing out of the ordinary. Basically run of the mill for me. The pork was cold, which I couldn&#39;t believe. The egg was cooked through and had zero ooze. The overall dish was just very very ordinary, nothing I would expect from a place with such a reputation, but more like a food court. 

The tuna bowl was a total disgrace. The sushi quality was very low, think Ralph&#39;s grocery store. Then to top it off we swapped the rice for vegetables and that just ended up being old shredded flavorless cabbage. 

I&#39;ve learned one thing about the LA food scene is people flock in masses to hyped restaurants. Maybe they pay off the right people to get that initial success and publicity, then just ride the hype wave to the bank. This is one of those places."

Plus, it&#39;s been years that I had real ramen. The wait was an hour wait and it was no biggie since this is a very popular restaurant in Little Tokyo. 

My friend and I ordered the daikoku ramen and it was delicious and the food came by pretty fast. The broth was flavorful, meat was tender and the portion was worth it for the price. We also ordered it in a combo plate w/ a side of one of their specialty friend rice and salad. After eating the salad and the ramen, I did not knew that it filled me up pretty fast. I only ate a couple of bites of my fried rice and didn&#39;t knew it was a huge side portion that I expected to be so I took it to go. If your appetite is average to mild, I&#39;d recommend to just order the ramen but if you&#39;re very hungry, you can just go for the combination.

If you&#39;re craving for food around Little Tokyo and willing to wait for an hour, check this place out. I&#39;ll consider this place one of the best ramen I had so far."

And there are not too many Japanese owned ramen places nowadays! 

Their broth is pretty good, noodles cooked al dente and their chasu is perfectly fatty and tender. I love their rice bowls especially the fried rice and the shredded pork bowl. The fried rice is cooked in some sort of lard - fatty but delicious. The shredded pork bowl has a nice char on the outside, marinated well (some sort of teriyaki marinade) and topped off with ginger and onions. 

Order a combo (ramen + rice bowl) so you can try the best of both worlds."

Of course when you&#39;re hungry, what do you do, you order too much. Our table for 4 ordered 4 ramen, one tempura, beef bowl, 2 sushi rolls, one gyoza, and one sashimi set..... waaaay too much food. 

I only tried the gyoza, tempura, and ramen. I was very full, but the ramen wasn&#39;t as tasty as I was hoping it would be. It comes in a large bowl that is half filled, loaded with green onions (yum). There is garlic you can add on the side which I love, I put two heaping spoonfuls in there after I drank half the broth.

As we stared inside longingly, stomachs growling, hunger turned into resentment for all the other people who were eating like snails. 

One hour later, we finally got seated and admittedly order.

She got: Daikokuya Ramen

I got: the pork cutlet bowl. 

Our food came out quickly. After the obligatory pictures we jumped right into it. I really enjoyed the pork cutlet. The pork is quite large and the egg on top adds a nice texture to it. The soy sauce marinade just adds to the flavoring and my resentment transformed to happiness. The ramen had a nice flavor, but maybe it was mixture of both of our meals, but I was so thirsty. Beware that there is a lot of salt so bring some extra water.

Be sure you come here with someone who&#39;s presence you enjoy or you&#39;re in for a long, wait time filled with awkward silences, and desperate glances on your phone hoping something interesting shows up on the screen.

Such a teeny, tiny place which is reminiscent of Shin Sen Gumi in Monterey Park.  The space is so small my legs felt awkward while we ate.  BUT!  But at least the food was good.

Daikokuya Ramen
- Broth was very full of flavor and creamy.  And this is without the added pork back fat.  The pork slices were very tender and I was even impressed by the boiled egg they have in there.  Of course, I think quality wise its not any different from a lot of ramen places all over Los Angeles but I&#39;m just glad I wasn&#39;t disappointed after our long wait.

Takoyaki
-  Octopus balls?  Why, of course, dear sir.  How can I say no to those golden brown balls with creamy goodness inside?  In all honesty, I&#39;ve hated every single takoyaki I&#39;ve tried but that hasn&#39;t stopped me from ordering each time I see it on the menu.  And finally.  FINALLY.  I found the one place with great takoyakis.  Soft, creamy and with bits of octopus meat inside, these little ones (or big ones - it&#39;s a matter of perspective) are worth their price.

Don&#39;t get me wrong - it&#39;s very good - but not really worth the wait, which is inevitable.  The broth is on the thicker side and the spicy wasn&#39;t really very spicy.

I was so starving by the team that we were seated that I ordered the combo with the eel rice bowl and didn&#39;t even touch the eel since the ramen was so filling.

She only lives a couple of blocks from here, so we always pass by it. However, there&#39;s always a bunch of people waiting outside. 

On this visit, my 4th one within the past year, we finally got to have ramen here! Hallelujah! My need for a good ramen fix has finally come to fruition. We only had to wait 15 minutes tops to get seated at the bar/counter. It&#39;s such a tiny place that we would have had to wait longer if we wanted a booth. Bar seating was fine, though it got to be quite warm where we were which was next to the kitchen. 

We ordered the Gyoza for an appetizer and I have to say that it&#39;s the best Gyoza I&#39;ve had in a long long time! We enjoyed it so much we ordered another one after finishing it. The super crispy top of the gyoza adds so much flavor to the whole thing. So freaking good!!! Thrillist calls it a &#34;masterpiece&#34; and who am I to argue with that! 

We both ordered the Daikoku Ramen which is their Tonkotsu based ramen. We didn&#39;t ask for any additions and we didn&#39;t really need any. Great ramen! Loved the broth! Definitely better than the ramen we had at Mr. Ramen which is a few doors down a few months ago. 

If you sit by the bar, you&#39;ll soon have rivulets of sweat rolling down your temples as you&#39;re eating your ramen. As soon as we finished our ramen and Gyoza, we paid up (cash only!!!) and went outside to cool down! Ahh, fresh air...

A few pieces of pork served alongside is amazing as well, you know, typical melt in your mouth pork goodness.  

the reason for 4 star is this. 

i got a combo with ramen and a katsudon bowl.  katsudon served along was smaller portion than their full portion but still enough; the problem is its flavor.  it has your typical dark soy, mirin onion and Katsuobushi flavor, except for it is LOADED with sugar. i do like some sweetness to my katsudon, but they did really overdo it. granted, this was my first visit so it could&#39;ve been cook&#39;s oopsie sugar dump but still, serving that mistake is giving -1 star.

another problem is ambiance and environment.  this place is pretty small and packed with folks but the way they have seating japanese-style is WAY too small even for small guys like me.  and lastly, it is hot as !@#$ hell in here. winter time, it may be good to have a bowl of ramen noodles to warm my stomach and all, but summer time, you may die from potential heat stroke.

The place was pretty small and crowded. We got the famous daikoku ramen combo, that came out about 10 minutes after we placed our order. The salad that came with the combo was tasty. The size of the bowl was huge. I thought the noodles itself was really good and had great texture. The broth was creamy and wasn&#39;t too salty.

I&#39;ve tried this place before and it didn&#39;t leave me with much thought.  I&#39;ve tried this place three times and still couldn&#39;t figure out why people hyped it so much.  As much review as this place have and the rating they received, I couldn&#39;t wrapped my head around the buzz that people been clamoring about.  I think its a bit overrated.  My two stars for them isn&#39;t to designate their quality of ramen being poor.  Its decent.  Its just I&#39;ve had better.

This ramen place, figuring as famous as they are, should yield a few more selections for their patrons then their choice of two. House special and Spicy.  But hey, there are restaurants out there that have limited items on the menu and done well.  Well.... their ramen is plainly underwhelming.  Broth was on the light side.  I had to douse my bowl with their table spice and garlic paste to enrich the flavor.  A regular bowl can feed two by the way.  I had so much noodles where it became monotonous to finish.  Ratio of ingredients were a off.  Luckily, I ordered extra bean sprouts to have more texture than of the noodle.  The redundant noodle and lackluster of a broth set me back a bit.  Again, I might concluded that its in Japan town, small joint, two choice of ramen, late hours, interior decor and long wait gave it its hype.  

Truly, I&#39;ve had better before from San Francisco, New York, and even Austin.  If you never been here, I encourage you to try and see for yourself.  Again, I&#39;ve tried this place multiple times and results are the same.  Just to name a few places for bases of comparison, SF: Ramen Dojo. New York: Ippudo.  Austin: Ramen Tatsuya.

To my immense surprise and pleasure, it was completely do-able to powerwalk here from the Courthouse, enjoy a leisurely lunch, and powerwalk back within 1.5 hours. Around 12 on a weekday, there was very little wait! This is a far cry from the last time I tried to eat dinner here on a weekend and the wait was probably 1.5 hours in itself. Don&#39;t forget about the CASH ONLY! But even if you do, there are a few major banks located within a mile. 

The really nice thing is that once you sit your cheeks down at a table, you place your order and receive it within minutes. They are all about efficiency, it&#39;s just that they don&#39;t have the physical room to accommodate the demand. 

* DAIKOKU RAMEN ($9.95): Ordered it =kotteri= style so the broth was richer. This is like...my golden standard for ramen broth. I could not get enough of it and drank every drop, which is probably really unhealthy. Chashu is melt-in-your-mouth tender. Noodles are the perfect firmness for me the way they are, but you can always ask for different firmness. Every element here meshes together perfectly. ~ 5/5

* SPICY MISO RAMEN ($10.95): The spicy is a bit of a misnomer, because it is not very spicy by itself. However, you can ask for chili oil to add on. The broth in this one is creamy and rich, but it does not compare to the Daikoku broth (for me). Still very good though, and the toppings are consistently perfect. ~ 4.5/5

Atmosphere:
This location is teeny tiny! So yes, you&#39;re gonna wait for a seat. How long determines on what time you get there to put your name on the list. There is a host that greets you at the front, not the friendliest by the way, and asks how many in your party. I was in a group of three and we waited about an hour and half (also factor in the wait will always be longer on the weekends). When you proceed to the entrance there is a huge drape you swing back before entering through the door. Extremely tight quarters to the right and the left of you with an isle down the middle. It&#39;s simple, cozy and quaint. 

Food:
The order consisted of Spicy Miso Ramen bowl, The Classic Daikoku Ramen 2 bowls and small Teriyaki eel bowl (Unagi-Don). My favorite by far was the Spicy Miso, it had a punch of flavor and spice. The noodles were perfect with a nice consistency, not soggy and not too crunchy. The meat was tender and seasoned well, the egg was excellent, poached just to soft stage. I was also pleased with the other two dishes as well, nicely seasoned and prepared to all our liking. 

Service:
Our waitress was such a cutie. She was helpful, friendly, patient and offered good suggestions. She didn&#39;t rush us to order and the wait time to receive our food was minimal. I also appreciated the fact she kept our water glasses full the entire time, checked on us regularly, didn&#39;t hover or act anticipatory. The epitome of an excellent waitress, too bad I can&#39;t remember her name.

Parking:
There are parking garages located all around in this area (Little Tokyo) your best bet is to go with these. Metered parking is also available, if you can find it. The traffic here can tend to get a little overwhelming so plan accordingly.

Overall experience was enjoyable. I had good company along with good food, which together makes for a marvelous time. The wait and cramped quarters unfortunately lowers the score a little however the food keeps it at a 4 star experience.

I get their house speciality, Daikoku Ramen and it never disappoints.

A few things, as others have probably mentioned, this location only takes cash so do bring bills with you before you come in. Also, they don&#39;t do reservations, as far as I understand. You arrive and sign in and based on available seating and time, you and your party will be seated accordingly.

Wait times for dinner can be up to an hour or two so do prepare to wait. I&#39;ve mostly gone here during dinner but last time I was here I came right when it opened (11AM) and did not have trouble getting a seat.

Optimal seating is or parties 1-4 people; and larger and you&#39;ll probably be waiting a long time.  It took about 30 minutes for my group of 4 to get seats along the kitchen wall.

I ordered the combination Daikoku ramen bowl plus a small teriyaki eel bowl, which together cost $20.50.  It&#39;s a great deal because it&#39;s a lot of food, and I got to try different things on the menu.

The ramen was flavorful and filling.  The boiled egg was my favorite part, and it had a lot of broth, which I prefer when eating ramen.  I asked for the kotteri flavor, which adds a more fatty flavor to the broth.  Bowls are made to order, so if you want to customize your ramen, just tell the server.

The eel bowl was absolutely my favorite dish.  The eel was sweet and moist, and I chewed without catching any bones.  I would&#39;ve been happy eating just the rice bowl, definitely order it if you are an eel fan!!

Daikokuya isn&#39;t a place to linger, so once you&#39;re done eating, pay your bill and go because there is surely a line of other people waiting for their turn to eat this yummy food!"

On the real yer boy wasn&#39;t scared this mug was gonna be way over hyped. But when that first spoonful hit my mouth I felt like my boy Andrew Wiles seeing Fermat&#39;s Last Theorem for the first time, I knew this bowl of next level sh*t was gonna change my life. 

If you ain&#39;t knowing by my name, I loves to grub and I been grubbin on nothin by dope food. I got the gut to prove it, but I never had soup makin me feel some type of way. This spot tho, I don&#39;t know that words can describe it, the favors they gettin from that broth, the tenderness of the meat. Woo, finna go wait in line right now to grab me another bowl."

My boyfriend and I were quite disappointed with the broth and the cha siew - we had the heavy broth, which was simply fatty and didn&#39;t have a wow factor like some of the spots in NY (like Minca and Totto). Normally I&#39;d drink the soup to the bottom of the bowl; however I left with the entire soup as was. The cha siew was plain average as it isn&#39;t the type to melt in your mouth and wasn&#39;t well seasoned. 

We also tried the seasonal cold ramen; as it was one of our first times having this, we weren&#39;t huge fans of cold broth that had ice in it so it&#39;s hard for us to fairly criticize.

We waited approximately 30 mins. on a weekday during lunch so it wasn&#39;t too terrible. However, this would probably not be something I&#39;d come back to again if I revisit LA and would not wait for."

After reading the reviews I got my ramen with the kotteri broth and it was great! You get your food pretty fast once you get seated and it comes out piping hot. The broth was rich and fatty. The egg was cooked perfectly. The meat was really soft and fell apart as I tried to pick it up. I usually prefer thicker ramen noodles but these thin ones were surprisingly good. 

If you like your ramen spicy ask for the chili oil. It adds spice to the broth without altering the flavor too much. I also ended up adding some of the grated garlic that was available at the table. 

I think I came during one of the hottest days this summer so it was a struggle for me to fully enjoy my meal in there. I don&#39;t think they have AC. My god it was so freaking hot in there...

This place is kind of hard to spot but you&#39;ll know because of the people waiting outside.

Ever wondered what heaven on Earth looked (or tasted) like? Well, if you want to find out, just come to Daikokuya.

Expect a wait! This place is very small and incredibly popular. My friends and I as a group of around 4-5 put our name on the guest list on a Saturday night and it took us a little over an hour for us to get seated.

For appetizers, we decided on the Takoyaki and the Sliced Roast Pork. I&#39;ve tried Takoyaki at a couple of places in San Diego and they were always overly doughy. The Takoyaki here was very flavorful and had a way better meat to dough ratio. The Sliced Roast Pork was amazing though and had our group dying for more. Seriously the most tender, flavorful, delicious slab of perfectly fatty meat I have ever experienced at a Japanese restaurant. We loved that so much we ordered another one immediately after without hesitation. For our main meal, we all actually unanimously decided on the Daikoku Ramen, but opted for the Kotteri flavor, which uses added soup extracted from the back fat. Oh my goodness gracious, this ramen came descending from the heavens for sure. Best ramen I have ever had and we all agreed to this. The soup broth was amazing and had a perfect thick consistency, they give you a ton of noodles, the meat and eggs were just cooked perfectly... the whole dish itself was perfection. The bowl is pretty large and will certainly get you full, especially if you were like us and indulged on appetizers! 

Although very crowded and popular, the service here was great too. Our server and the other workers were very kind, patient, and didn&#39;t look stressed out. Their patience and kindness definitely contributed to the overall good experience.

Out of all the ramen places I&#39;ve tried in San Diego as well as Los Angeles, I would have to say that this is my overall favorite ramen I&#39;ve tried."

Parking in the area is not too bad - typical LA area with meters. You can also park a little farther, like in the Art District, and take a stroll through the area. 

Beware, the line does get long though, especially during prime meal times but even during off times! It&#39;s a very popular ramen joint but you can put your name down then cross the street and check out the beautiful area of Little Tokyo (be sure to check and get there before your name is up though!). 

They are known for their ramen and I must say that it is pretty good! I have also tried their small sushi bowls and appetizers but was not really a fan of either. The ramen however is well made and proportions are not bad! I wouldn&#39;t say it was the best ramen I&#39;ve ever had but I do always come back. I would give it 3.5 if I could but rounded up to a 4 because I usually go back to let new friends try it."

Depth of flavour, slightly creamy, nice noodles. I will say their chasu is the best I&#39;ve had in LA so far. Definitely worth trying but keep in mind this place runs a wait list non stop. I subtracted one star because their floor staff seemed to generally hate life. I realise their busy but the girl working the wait list first just tossed a clipboard at me and said nothing. Do I write my name down or do you? Pretty basic. Then she called names and their number once, marked that she called them, and maybe repeated once if at all. You should definitely take note of what number you are on the list and make sure you listen for your number coming up. Lots of people come and take off and then miss their number and its sort of a circus. Once seated the girl who took our order was good but she disappeared and getting a check was a major effort with another waitress who refused to look up until we all just stood up. 

Definitely give it a try. Don&#39;t wait a long time and don&#39;t try and bring a group."

The ramen was absolutely solid delicious ramen, no complaints about the quality at all. But I can&#39;t say it was better than other places that I enjoy. And to make it extra annoying, it&#39;s cash only.

Look, good ramen, totally worth eating, but the lower score is because the wait is silly when you can go other places for just as good of ramen elsewhere and you can use your credit card."

From the headlines of Thrillist, Daikokuya makes &#34;The Best Ramen in 15 LA Neighborhoods,&#34; list. With ramen joints popping&#39; up all over the place how the list could be so short, I needed to know. Relatively central meeting point for me and a couple girlfriends to chow, chat, and chuckle we met up here one evening. Knowing the line to get seated was always horrid, &#34;40 minute wait at 10 o&#39;clock at night,&#34; I read in an article, we were all prepared to suck it up and wait. We got lucky, we didn&#39;t wait much more than 15 minutes before our party was called.

Small and cramped, a narrow walkway from the front of the restaurant to the back, separates patrons sitting elbow to elbow at the counter slurpin&#39; their bowls of ramen and the booths for four people that runs along the wall. Follow the narrow path filled with supplies and whatnot on both sides, pass the kitchen and you&#39;ll find the restroom. Ummm... I&#39;ve seen better restrooms at gas stations. Truly needs a lot of TLC, both indoors and out. In fact, the interior of this whole establishment could use some fixin&#39; up. With over 6k Yelp reviews and still holding 4-stars, this must be the bomb of all ramen joints. 

ORDERED:
 1/2 order of Daikoku Ramen, which is infused with a blended soy sauce, boiled chijire style egg noodles, kurobuta pork belly chashu, marinated boiled egg, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, green onions and a sprinkle of sesame seeds.

As modest as this place is, it was hoppin&#39;, mostly the staff hoppin&#39; from one table to the next, taking orders from patrons, picking up and delivering hot bowls of soup, as well as a plethora of appetizers. No sooner than we placed our order was it brought to our table all hot and steamy. The service was definitely not as slow as a tortoise moving backward. 

Good ramen portion with several pieces of pork belly chashu lays under a mound of green onion and a sprinkle of sesame seeds. The broth was think, if there was any garlic, I didn&#39;t taste it, nor did I find it anywhere on the table for that added BAM!!  

JUST A SQUEEZE:
If you have ever been to Little Tokyo, you know, parking is a bear. While there are parking structures nearby, they can be pricey, and metered parking is next to impossible to score. Daikokuya does not have their own parking, nor do they validate, or take reservations, so if you choose to slurp it up here, be prepared to pay the max. On this flip side, better to park in a structure than a meter where meter maids are waiting to slap a ticket on your car as your time ticks away. 

While they don&#39;t ADD MSG, some of their manufacturers do. This small, cramped, cluttered eatery does not take reservations Togo orders are not an option, lines are always long, and it&#39;s cash only. If you&#39;re ok with all that, and the lack of garlic, well then, have at it. Lastly, service is quick, we felt a bit rushed once we got our bowls, and it seems they are more about turnover than actual good customer service. 

Would this be in my top 15, as it is with Thrillist? Perhaps. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve been to 15 ramen places as of yet. Will I come back here? Eh, maybe if I&#39;ve got a semi to full tummy and time to kill, other than that, there are plenty of other ramen joints around."

I got the Daikokuya ramen with a small bowl of fried rice. The broth of the ramen was awesome. It was very rich that gets you full pretty quickly but not rich in a sense that it&#39;s fatty and greasy. Also, they give you a whole egg as opposed to half which was a big plus for egg-lover like me. Another thing to note about is their chashu. It&#39;s very fatty and tender and is probably the MVP of the bowl. The fried rice was also the star of the night. Usually it&#39;s hard to make such a simple dish into something really good but Daikokuya did not fail to do so. Not sure what they did but the fried rice here is extra aromatic and instantly boosts your appetite.

This place is so good that I believe is worth an hour wait. However, I&#39;m not really sure if it&#39;s amazing enough for a two hour wait. Service wasn&#39;t the greatest but they are fast and efficient in order to accommodate the crazy amounts of customers they have waiting in front of the store.

First off, their signature ramen. It had a nice light broth, good noodles cooked al dente, whole egg which was delicious - wish they had cut it in half though, and amazing pork. Honestly I think the pork was the best part. However, I was not a fan of bean sprouts and bamboo in my ramen. I think it kinda flavored the broth too much and i just didn&#39;t like it. I prefer my ramen with seaweed and maybe mushroom slivers, but not bean sprouts. Also, they were a little heavy handed on the green onions. 

Secondly, I came here on a wed night at 5pm. They already had a few people waiting. The waiting list just sits on a table, and even if you&#39;re a single person that just wants to sit at the bar, they don&#39;t really notice you. I put my name on the list and politely waited only to notice that another guest was immediately escorted to the bar since she was by herself. I got up and had to grab a waiter who talked to the hostess (in the back of the restaurant) to come seat me at the open bar. A bit of a hassle for just one person. I would expect such a busy place to have the waiting process down like a science. 

The rest of my meal was fine. Do bring cash as they have like 10 signs around the restaurant reminding you that they only take cash. 

Also they do have about 10 seats on either side of the entrance for waiting. The whole dining room area has about 8 booths of 4 ppl and a bar that can seat about 10 people."

At the time of my review, this first and original location of Daikokuya has 6317 reviews, and I have to wonder when this place is going to hit 10,000, just like all the Y2K predictions said the Dow would hit 10,000 when the millennium arrived.

Word of mouth says this is the best ramen spot in LA, and being new to the city, I got to try it twice in the last week. I tried both versions of their standard daikoku ramen: kotteri style (with extra pork back fat) and regular.

Here&#39;s the low down:

1) Find this place by spotting its bright yellow awning and the crowd of people waiting outside. When I arrived on a Friday at 615PM, I was seated within 20 minutes, surprisingly, although I was alone. My second time, my friend and I went on a Monday at 7:30PM -- we thought we would be doomed with a long wait, but we were seated in under 10 minutes! There&#39;s an app called Bounce that tells you what the current wait time is at the Little Tokyo (and Sawtelle) locations of Daikokuya, but it&#39;s not really reliable. Just show up and I promise it&#39;s worth the wait!

2) Parking: the street meters right in front surprisingly open up around 7:30PM and there is no charge after 8PM. Otherwise it was like $3 an hour. Your best bet is to park in the Japan Village mall parking structure directly across the street, where the charge is $3 for up to 2 hours and you&#39;ll be able to easily find a spot.

3) Write your name down as you arrive and listen for them to call your number. There are probably ten seats inside for waiting, but expect to stand outside and don&#39;t go too far.

4) If you don&#39;t want to bother, directly next door there is another ramen place that doesn&#39;t have a wait (heard good things but haven&#39;t tried it) and a well-regarded udon place that makes its own noodles fresh.

5) Friendly service, especially from that one hip waiter!

6) Extremely quick to get your food after you order, probably about 10 minutes
7) Huge portion with lots of perfectly al dente chewy curly noodles, a FULL soft-boiled egg (not half), plenty of bean sprouts, scallions and a little bit of bamboo shoots for only $10. Add-ons such as corn, butter, more sprouts are 50 cents to $1 and if you want either extra broth or noodles the charge is $2.50. I did feel I would have like a bit more broth but it was just about right.

8) Not only delicious but probably one of the better $ values in town. Many LA ramen places only give you soup and noodles to start and you have to add the egg and toppings and you could end up paying $15 easily for a bowl of ramen whereas Daikokuya gives you everything you want for $10. Many other places only give you half an egg if they do at all. Also I want to note that while the broth is salty, I don&#39;t think they use MSG because I&#39;m very sensitive to it.

9) The handmade gyoza was amazing! Nice brown crust on the bottom that connected the chive and pork dumplings, all served bottom side up. I&#39;ve had this a lot at Japanese and Chinese restaurants but this was probably one of the best I&#39;ve had outside of an exclusive dumpling joint. It is best when it arrives and still is hot enough to nearly burn the roof of your mouth.

10) I much preferred the standard daikoku pork broth without the extra fat in the kotteri style as the kotteri style is definitely more oily although more flavorful. 

11) Cash only and there are signs everywhere to remind you. There&#39;s an ATM inside or go next door to the little gift shop and make a small debit card purchase with cash back.

12) There are now 4 locations so if you&#39;re not near downtown LA you can check out the newest one on the Westside in the Sawtelle district, or hit up the locations in the more Chinese-leaning neighborhoods of Arcadia and Monterey Park.

By the time I finish writing this review, I&#39;ll bet the number will be up to 6320."

I love that this place feels divey and is definitely a hot spot downtown for ramen so that I appreciate. The portions are large and the ramen was tasty but not my favorite. There was something lacking to make it really &#34;wow&#34;. The service was scant and just ok actually a little below average expectations. No one introduces themselves at the table. The guy approached us immediately after sitting down and said &#34;want are you ordering?&#34; I said we needed some time to look at the menu and he walked away without saying anything. Seemed a bit rude to me. Also took forever to get someone to pick up the bill so we sat around waiting to pay for quite some time.

It seems fitting to have ramen/noodles to ring in the new year and that&#39;s exactly what I did on January 1st of this year. After a slow and semi-rough start due to the previous night&#39;s festivities, I hauled my ass down to Little Tokyo to participate in the blessing and tieing of fortunes at the local temple. 

Parking this day was horrendous. With lots gauging their prices at $20 and beyond, I luckily found street parking but a considerable distance away. Our first stop was Daikokuya to put our name down because from the look of the growing crowd outside, we had quite awhile to wait. 

One temple, a few blessings and 1.5 hours later, we made it back just in time for our name to be called! Now, I&#39;ve been here many times in my undergrad days and this visit did not disappoint. My favorite on the menu is their ramen combos with donburi. I chose a tonkatsu/pork cutlet and was very impressed with the taste and flavor of the donburi.

Overall, there is little that can be said about this joint that already hasn&#39;t been said. It&#39;s amazing and will always remain one of my favorite ramen stops in LA!"

So we did the following week wait and wait and wait till we finally got our number called. 

The ramen is seductive.  It&#39;s amazing, but it&#39;s very salty and you&#39;ll be wanting to drink gallons of water later, but heck I didn&#39;t mind and I&#39;ll be stoppin by again and again."

Food
-The ramen is very flavorful and the meat is very tasty as well. The broth is jam packed with flavor. I do not usually finish the soup of most noodle soup dishes but i always try my hardest to finish the broth because it is so flavorful. I also go a rice bowl that was just as good as the ramen

Price
- The price is about average for most ramen places

Parking
- Parking sucks here because its in little Tokyo which means you have to fight for parking spots or just use the structure but i always try to find parking on the streets because its cheaper

Service
-The workers are very friendly and helpful when you ask questions about the menu and they give out excellent recommendations to new customers

Wait
- Always expect to wait a long time! Every time i came here i have always had to wait over 30 minutes to almost 2 hours

Recommendation
- Even with the bad parking and the super long wait, i still give it 5 stars which means it must be that good! I 100% RECOMMEND THIS PLACE! especially for people who do not like ramen ! This place has changed my girlfriends perception on ramen and now she loves it!"

Another highlight of our dinner was the tofu nugget. They are deep fried tofu with vegetables (edamame and carrots), served alongside a sweet chilli sauce. The tenderness of the tofu won everyone&#39;s heart!

Waited about an hour or so before we got seated for group of 4 but then again which popular place in socal doesn&#39;t make you wait. Food came out pretty fast as well. Definitely was worth the wait. They gave us salad and rice for the items we ordered but not sure if there was something wrong with the salad because it had a bitter taste to it. But other than that the ramen and eel with rice were really good. Definitely a come back again spot for the future.

On to the food, this is by far one of the best Japanese ramen I&#39;ve had in a very long time. If you&#39;re looking for a place to have a 30min sit and dine meal, a quick in and out, come here.

If you&#39;re looking for ramen that&#39;ll fill you up, Daikokuya will do it! The broth is really rich and flavorful, but it gets to the point where it&#39;s so rich that it&#39;ll fill you up pretty quickly! My favorite part about Daikokuya is the combo plate! You can get a bowl of ramen and a bowl of rice for ~$15, depending on which rice bowl you order! I always to-go my rice bowl to eat for later nom nom ~ As for the ramen texture, the noodles are definitely softer than Shin Sen Gumi&#39;s noodles, so it just depends on your own preference

I think this is place is definitely worth a visit if you&#39;ve never tried it, just cause the quality of the ramen is so good, but besides that.. I wouldn&#39;t wait more than 30 min for this place LOL I&#39;m just not that big a fan of super rich broths"

The food is alright but the portions are on the smaller side. The problem with that is their prices are 1 to 2 dollars more than most other Thai restaurants. They have all the common Thai dishes and a few other intriguing Thai street food type dishes.

The restaurant itself is a more clean and modern type of place though the TVs play Thai music videos so you do get some of that authentic vibe. 

Nothing really stood out to me from our pad see ew and pad thai order. The pad thai tended to be mushier than I wanted. I will give them credit that they definitely bring the spice and that made for flavorful dishes.

I still can&#39;t get behind how much more they charge for essentially the same Thai food in smaller portions. For example, mango sticky rice is $7.50 which is higher than most places I&#39;ve been.

I normally eat curry with standard jasmine rice, so I was taken aback that I enjoyed the curry with sticky rice.

Papaya Salad &#39;som tum Thai&#39; &amp; Drunken noodles &#39;pad kee mao&#39;

I love my Thai food (being Thai and all), so I thought they have to be good at Som Tum... and they were. I believe they cater to Thai people regarding their Northeast meals - the papaya salad was spicy - I requested Medium, but it was a good spicy. A THAI spicy. It was really good and had a great kick to it. The flavors were great too and not too wet, which is good because most Som Tums have too much sauce and smells too fishy.

Although they did a great job with the Isaan food... they disappointed me in the regular Thai food in the form of Pad Kee Mao. It was spicy, which was great, but it lacked a lot of flavors that pad kee mao is known for. It was really disappointing. I order Pad Kee Mao at almost every Thai place because it&#39;s one of my favorites, but this place was bad. They seemed to have used the wrong herbs. Instead of basil, they used sage, which made the taste a bit bitter and bland. I actually couldn&#39;t find any traces of basil. The noodles felt a bit dry too when it should have moist, but not drenched, with sauce. 

So my take on this place is that they did do a good job on the Isaan portion of food, but when it came to the standard dishes, it was not as good. Hence, the name Isaan Station. 

This was a DELIVERY order."

I drive by this place ALL the time, but never have tried it until recently.  This place is a hidden gem within koreatown.

BUT- I was so very wrong (and happy to be wrong)

Keep in mind the portions ARE a bit smaller compared to other thai spots, but still will fill you up :) 

Service was okay, but the food was 5 stars.
 My boyfriend and I ordered:

Crying tiger: I asked them to cook it medium rare and this was really good. I&#39;ve tried this dish at other thai spots but this place is one of the best I&#39;ve had. The sauce is amazing. For those unfamiliar it is a sliced beef plate with a special tangy/spicy sauce to dip on the side. 5/5 

Tom yum soup (spicy): SOOO GOOOOOD, we ordered it spicy and man that spice carried down all the way as you drink it- but we love spicy so it was delicious. Tom
Yum is a common soup dish with veggies &amp; mushrooms and usually seafood, but here its an additional charge for the seafood. I was sooo very happy with this soup here it. It had the perfect mix of spicy and tangy zest and would def come back for this soup alone. 5/5

Pad see ew: classic thai dish- I ordered it with beef and it was good. 3.5/5 just because it didn&#39;t stand out &amp; the portions are a bit smaller BUT its still good if thats what you&#39;re craving.

The seasoning was on point and I loved how aesthetically pleasing the food looked. The food was delivered in these really nice black containers so that was an A+. The steak was super tender and well seasoned. The only downside to the steak was that there was a bit too much fat but it was really good overall. Since the Pad Thai was delivered, the noodles were all stuck together but that&#39;s not the restaurants fault (Just a heads up if you&#39;re taking it to go). The Pad Thai was really sweet so if you like sweet food go for the Pad Thai. I liked how they put the nuts of the Pad Thai in this tiny container so that it isn&#39;t splattered everywhere in the noodles. (Plus some people are allergic to nuts so I thought that was very thoughtful of them A++). The fried rice was pretty good but the tomato tasted a bit odd.

I recommend branching out if you come here.

I like my food spicy and find that most places can&#39;t meet my spice expectations. That was not the case at Isaan.  They are not messing around with the spice here.  Get ready to sweat and have your nose run, folks.  I find it to be comparable to Night + Market but at about half (or less) the price.

We tried the:

Nahm Dtok Mhu (Spicy charcoal grilled pork with red onion, mint leaves, lime, rice powder, cilantro, coriander and green onion)

Tom Saab Kra Dhook Mhoo (Hot and sour soup of braised pork ribs, broth Thai herbs, lemongrass, galangal, kiffir lime leaves, chili and lime juice)

Sticky Rice - a small order probably just sufficient for one - unless you are watching your carbs, I&#39;d recommend getting one per person.

Both dishes were spicy, flavorful, and authentic. Because both were pork, next time I&#39;d love to try some chicken or seafood.

A quaint spot, they are going for the whole &#34;street food&#34; vibe. Although completely casual, it&#39;s a bit more upscale than that (not difficult). Cash only, but there is an ATM (there are two sides to the restaurant, it is on the left hand side)."

The combo of sticky rice/steak/dipping sauce was heaven. My friend ordered the pad thai and it was good as well. Would love to come back to try other items on the menu. Nice escape from the packed restaurants in Thai Town. 

There is valet parking, although the lot itself is small and may be busy during peak hours. The service was friendly and welcoming."

Thai food that I typically eat are the usual Pad Thai or Pad See-ew so we let our friend order and we decided to eat everything family style which was perfect since all the dishes come out in pretty generous proportions!

I can&#39;t remember every single dish we ordered but the ones I do remember are the Pad Thai, pork neck, papaya salad, and the tom yum soup. Everything was soo good. Best Pad Thai I&#39;ve ever had in my life. The noodles were a little bit different than what I&#39;ve had at other Thai places but nonetheless, it was great. The pork neck was super tender and flavorful. The papaya salad was so refreshing and tasty but warning - the mild is prettyyy spicy. I thought I could handle the spice (being Korean and all) but the spice lingered on my lips for a while so beware!"

Larb was spicy and tasty. Issan sausage was authentic with a wonderful flavor. Our favorite was the pork jerky. It comes with an incredibly tasty sauce.

We arrived about 30 minutes before midday closing and they were so friendly. They let us order and eat without rushing us, even after they closed. Very Thai!"

One of the few Thai restaurants located in K-Twon area..I decided to check it out for a quick lunch. We were seated quickly and I ordered what I usually get (Pad Thai).  Food came out quickly, and it was really good! Large portions and I had left overs to take home.

Price is pretty average to me. Not too cheap and not more expensive than other places.

They have a very small private lot.  If you can&#39;t find parking there, then you might have to find street parking in the neighborhood area."

I got there right after it opened so I was the only one there with loud Asian pop music playing on the big screen.

The problem with Thai food is you need 4 people to really get a good amount of dishes and enjoy your meal. It was just me so I order the main dishes I wanted to try, som tum and the grilled pork neck. 

I asked the spicy level and I chose Thai medium. Now I like spicy but she told me Thai medium was hot and at Lotus of Siam (best Thai restaurant in America) the medium is friggen hot. Well the Thai lady in the open kitchen saw a white boy in business clothes and made it mild so the som tum was really weak. She brought me out more chills to add and saved the dish. A little fishier than I like but good flavor all around.

The pork neck was insane! Best pork dish ever. Fatty, but not mushy, charcoal grilled so the smokiness was prevailing, and the dipping sauce was soooo good. I think tamarind chili sauce. Really a dish meant to be shared but I couldn&#39;t help myself and killed the whole thing. All eaten with the ubiquitous sticky rice, a match made in heaven. 

I would def return.

P.S great service"

Everything was very good, the chicken curry soup was delicious, the beef dish with a weird name but  I can&#39;t remember, was super tender and yummy. And the pad Thai was good too! The papaya salad was way to spicy but the waitress did warn us it may have been. If you love hot you would have been in heaven!

It&#39;s located in a small shopping center and they have a big sign so it&#39;s not hard to miss. $2 for valet in the small lot but if you&#39;re lucky you can find some parking around the neighborhood. 

The restaurant itself is nice and colorful. I loved the decorations of sunflowers, colorful chairs, and hanging lights. The service was good too in that they were very attentive. We were a party of four and ordered at the same time. My food and my friend&#39;s Tina and Mary came quick but my friend TK, who ordered the Crying Tiger, got his food a bit later than ours. I ordered the Nahm Dtok Mhu, medium level spicy (spicy grilled pork with red onion, cilantro, green onion) with a side of sticky rice. The Nahm Dtok Mhu itself was full of flavor and tasty. I can usually handle spicy dishes but this was a bit more than I expected and it was just at a medium level! The food was still tasty though and I liked pairing it with the sticky rice. I would get this dish again. I got a taste of the Crying Tiger and it was okay. The meat was cooked well but the flavor wasn&#39;t amazing or anything. I liked the sauce that came with the dish though, I can eat that stuff all day.

It&#39;s nice to find another Thai restaurant that isn&#39;t clustered in the Hollywood area. Sometimes it&#39;s such a hassle driving to Thai town and parking is difficult there almost all the time so I&#39;m glad that I found one closer to home that&#39;s authentic too. I find that the portions here are smaller than other Thai restaurants so I was still a little hungry afterwards.

They are cash only but luckily they have an ATM machine in the restaurant. It&#39;s an extra $2.00 fee to withdraw but I didn&#39;t mind withdrawing from this machine. I&#39;ve been to restaurants that had ATM&#39;s inside of their establishment and the machine looked shady but this one didn&#39;t give me problems at all.

4 stars for this restaurant and I will be coming back to try the other dishes and desserts on their menu."

I recommend ordering mild spicy because even that is almost too much to handle. WOW, WOW, WOW that&#39;s all I have to say about the food.  I will be back for the grilled chicken and tom yum!

We like the Pad See Ew here. It&#39;s always perfect. The Crying Tiger is awesome too! The Papaya Salad is OK. The portions are good and the prices are great! The service is really good here too! Can&#39;t say I really like their decor though.

The only drawbacks are the fact they are cash only and that they play Thai pop which sounds like they are playing the same song over and over. Well, there&#39;s also the fact they have a small lot which is usually full. That doesn&#39;t really matter though since they are very close to my apartment."

I came here not expecting Thai food so good.  There were couple of missteps, but overall the food here was phenomenal.

I&#39;ll start with the good.  Their green curry is probably THE tastiest curry I have ever had.  It was full of flavor and delicious veggies and meat.  But it wasn&#39;t too greasy, heavy or too much coconut milk which happens way too often.  I can&#39;t wait to go back for that.  Same goes for Pad Thai which is an ubiquitous dish, but really stood out here.  It was fresh and delicious.  The crying tiger was delicious as well.

The areas for improvement.  Their shrimp fried was a bit overcooked and needed some shrimp paste or some veggies to make it better.  The soup was great as well, but we should have ordered the regular Thom Yum, because the seafood one was a little too fishy.  Finally the larb with glass noodles had all the great flavor you want, but the noodles took the bite out of the dish and made it too mushy.  It was just a texture thing, and there are regular larb on the menu that&#39;s probably great.

I can&#39;t wait to go back to get my favorites and try some new items."

The high cost to small portions and smell of the restaurant, not to mention inconvenient location knocked it down a star. 

This restaurant smack in the middle of K-town on Western off 1st. There&#39;s a busy parking lot with free valet but I hate having people drive my car and really, is it free if you&#39;re obligated to tip? I opted to-go so I parked in 1 of their 2 ten minute parking spaces. (p.s. some douche stayed in the other space before i got there and continued to stay after i left) The outside of the restaurant is very modern, reminiscent of a seafood or bakery in SF wharf. I think it&#39;s the light fixtures they have outside their sign. It&#39;s kind of weird. The signage doesn&#39;t really reflect the restaurant but whatever.

What hits you first when you walk in is the smell. Smells like someone took a fresh dump then left the bathroom door open. It&#39;s not good. I&#39;m not sure if I would be able to sit down and eat at this place comfortably. I&#39;ve eaten in outdoor markets in Thailand, the ground fresh with fish guts, during a torrential downpour with cat-sized rats running around our feet. Not sure if I could stomach this. The smell was just too strong.

The food is good but the portions are soooo tiny! I ordered a side of sticky rice. I got a handful, not even a quarter of a container of rice, wrapped in a plastic bag for 1.50. Papaya salad was good but I didn&#39;t get much. The balance was really tasty I just wish there was more. Grilled beef lap was good. Oddly, it tastes a little like carne asada in salsa. Chicken lap was alright. It was really spicy but that was my fault asking for a 6. I didn&#39;t like how the chicken lap wasn&#39;t finely minced. It had huge wayward chunks that didn&#39;t make for a good bite. All in all about $30 for 3 dishes and a measly handful of rice. I feel like this place is overpriced for what you&#39;re getting. Value is just not there.

I&#39;m not sure if people realize there ARE lao options at most thai restaurants. Just don&#39;t order that stir fry fusion crap you&#39;re expecting at american-chinese restaurants. Sapp Coffee is cheaper and their lap is good. E-Rod San Sapp has great papaya salad, khao piak, lap, grilled pork and is cheaper and you get more food. Ontario has a few good thai/lao food as well as Norwalk and Artesia. I&#39;m disappointed. I was scouting restaurants to show my mom and dad (born in Sayaboury and Vientiane) when they fly into town. They would be like, wtf why are we paying for this.

Side note: I saw a guy come back into the restaurant with a half drank thai tea asking for a refund because it tasted &#34;chalky&#34; and &#34;sour&#34;. Seriously guy? You drank half of it. Also, if it&#39;s brewed fresh it will be slightly sour, that is the nature of Oliang tea. Reminder that being a good customer is just as important as getting good service. Btw, the service here is fabulous."

The restaurant was empty so we sat in one of the large orange booths and ordered Thai teas, a Tom Yum soup (good size for two), pad thai with chicken and the honey toast for the end. We requested the Tom Yum mildly spicy and it had a kick to it but it was the right amount. The pad thai was delicious. If you are hungry order two plates (one for yourself and the other for your food date). The honey toast was so darn good! It was a sugar overload for sure but still! So damn good!

I mean drinks spill, but just putting it out there that that&#39;s how it was delivered to me. I also  ordered Pad Thai and the Chicken, Khai Yang Ob Oong (Leg Quarter). Both dishes were mediocre. The chicken was super oily. The chicken itself was very oily and there was a thick layer of oil on the bottom of the container as well. The Pad Thai was okay, nothing spectacular. The Pad Thai noodles were clumped together.

It was expensive for what it was. I&#39;ve had $6 Pad Thais that tasted better. The Pad Thai here was $9.95. Not worth it and Portions were small too. Maybe it&#39;ll be better if you dine in, but I definitely do not recommend you order delivery from here."

Perfect for me since I&#39;m careful of how things are served. You won&#39;t see me eat off of street vendors. I&#39;ve heard too many stories of getting sick. 

Located on Western Blvd in Koreatown, Isaan serves street food in a brick and mortar.  This restaurant is my ideal way to have street food prepared.

This place is known for their Thai bbq chicken. I chose to skip that since I could get that anywhere.  I wanted to try something different.

So we tried Pad Kra Prao Ta-Lay which is stir fried seafood mixed with chili and basil which was delicious. We ordered all dishes medium spicy since we didn&#39;t want to scream the next morning. The Nahm Si-Krong is fried marinated pork rib. This was just okay. A bit sour since it&#39;s fermented. We also ordered Goong Chae Nam Pla Salad which is sashimi shrimps in spicy seafood sauce. This was very good, fresh and flavorful. Along with these dishes, you&#39;ll need some sticky rice to go with this.

Overall, the food was good and different. Not sure if I&#39;d go back but it was worth the adventure. Service here is decent. I needed tons of water to cool down the spice and they were prompt. Pricing reasonable. The only thing I noticed that I didn&#39;t like was the smell here. It may be from the fermented dishes. So be aware if your nose is sensitive and bothered by smells."

Highlight is the papaya salad. I&#39;ve always used it as an anchor for Thai food, have to say they made it well. Papaya was fresh and juicy, with some tomatoes adding to the sourness. Pretty good for an appetizer!

If you eat healthy, still want tasty, and need to gorge, this is the Thai place to go. It had good atmosphere with modern Thai music and not that boring dull-you-to-sleep stuff that some places put on.

Pad Thai is not terribly favorable and I felt the noodles were overcooked and seriously stuck together. So it turned into a big Pad Thai noodle ball.
The interior is a bit odd and the customer service isn&#39;t the best. Friendly, just not attentive or all that quick.

We went here based on the Yelp reviews and I was really disappointed. For starters, I guess we should&#39;ve been tipped off that it was pretty dead on a Saturday night. We ordered the Tom Yum soup. The girl said they have spicy level 1-10. My bf can handle some serious spice. I told her he can handle Ghost pepper No problem so what should we get. She said their food is really spicy so we should stick to just a spice level 7 max. Ok so the soup comes out. Um...I thought they made a mistake. It was not spicy at all.  I even let my mom try it, who cannot handle an ounce of spicy at all. Even she said it didn&#39;t taste so it at all and this was supposed to be a 7??? I told the server, she took it back and brought the soup back out with more spice. It made no difference.  We also got the pad Thai, shrimp fried rice. Both were pretty bad. It had a odd taste. Definitely didn&#39;t taste like Thai pad Thai or shrimp fried rice. Then there was the papaya salad.  That was ok.  Oh, and they take cash only. Who does that?? Who has cash nowadays???? 

And lastly, the parking attendants say they do valet only.  I say with all the options in LA, this is not one I would seek out."

Wow if you like minced pork (no fat on it) you MUST get the pork larb (with glass noodles).  Dear God that dish was out of this world amazing.  Would not change a thing about it.  It was like a 4th of July firework show in my mouth.  
Also, pad thai and pad kee mao were also quite tasty. 

As the staff is required to do (and wow were the girls cute, wait that doesn&#39;t affect the food, no comment)...if you get medium or spicy level with the dishes....they will warn they are not responsible.  If you can handle your spicy food..... get medium because its still quite spicy without taking away flavor.  I have yet to try spicy because I can tell most flavor will be lost with the absurd heat.  Medium is plenty hot for those of you who can handle the heat.  For those of you who don&#39;t like spicy, mild will still be a little spicy but worth the minor discomfort.

I went to the bathroom while leaving my parents at the table and that&#39;s a big mistake! When I came back out, mom was like &#34;I already ordered things you like hun.&#34; I didn&#39;t even bother to ask what did she order. I just kept on yelping. It&#39;s my new addiction now. :)

isaan-station-thai-street-food-los-angeles-2,Felix L.,YHr-ijGyWQg3hsP-sEEl4A,"Irvine, CA",1,1,1,912,74,HGEm8ysX8IzqcrT6shWuTQ,5.0,2014-04-20,"Thai food is much more than &#34;pad see ew&#34; and &#34;pad thai&#34;.

Just like different dialects and customs exist in each country in the world, there are distinct regional specialties in Thailand that arises from climate differences. Isaan is a Northeast region of Thailand that borders Laos to the north and Cambodia to the southeast. A significant amount of its population is involved in rice farming. Unfortunately, due to Isaan&#39;s distance from the sea, the climate is dry, leading to prolonged droughts and due to the poor soil, there may only be two harvests for rice per year.

Sticky rice is a staple of the Isan-Thai diet. This rice is clumped together unlike the soft grains in Jasmine rice. It is understood that Isan-Thai natives use their hands to eat the sticky rice with papaya salad or grilled meats. 

I learned about Issan Station from reading an article that lists the top 10 restaurants in LA that a Thai-native would visit. Issan Station in LA&#39;s Koreatown proudly serves very authentic Isaan food, and it would be a shame to come and not order dishes unique to the region. Put down your pad thai or pad see ew, because they are not specialties at this restaurant, and instead order:

- som dtum thai (very spicy and slightly sweet green papaya salad),
- tom saep kra dhook mhoo (hot and sour braised pork rib soup)
- khai yang ob oong (Thai charcoal grilled chicken marinated in turmeric)

Isan-Thai food can be a delight for people with sensitive taste buds. For example, the papaya salad appetizer tasted extremely spicy, sour, and sublime sweet, with heat lingering on the tongue. It was the first time I experienced this complex combination. The papaya and peanuts were crunchy and since they were served cold, it was refreshing at first, but the heat was a bit overwhelming for me. I&#39;m sure the mild version is even fiery for Western palates. Good thing the servers were attentive in refilling my water cup before I became a human flamethrower. If the flavors of the original papaya salad is not enough, there are even more variations on the menu. For example, the &#34;som dtum bhu pla rha&#34; is a variation loaded with fish sauce for enhanced flavors.

Next dish that arrived was an Isaan-style soup. The sourness and spiciness did not stop at the appetizer. In fact, the tom saep kra dhook mhoo elevated sourness to a new level, attributed to the heavy doses of lemongrass, Thai herbs, and lime leaves in the soup. Hot and sour soup is not foreign to me, but the Isaan version featured a huge explosion of tart flavor, tanginess, and richness that I had never tasted before. Very unique experience to eat the pork rib stock in a sour and deeply spiced Thai broth.

Finally, our Isaan meal closed with the Thai BBQ chicken. Grilled meats is a popular and simple street fare in northeast Thailand, with the &#34;crying tiger&#34; and &#34;khai yang&#34; being must-orders at this restaurant. The BBQ chicken at Isaan Station is extremely juicy and tender. It is lightly marinated before being delicately grilled, so dip it the honey and pungent chili dipping sauce. It goes well with the sticky rice.

Eating at Isaan Station allowed me to appreciate the cooking of northern-eastern Thai cuisine that contrasts the noodles, curries, and milder soups of central Thailand and the seafood of the southern Thai cooking. The Isaan recipes yield complex flavors despite being much more simplistic than recipes of other Thai regions. The heat level can be insane and beyond comparison. I am humbled and impressed at the level of spiciness that Thai natives can tolerate."

It&#39;s cash-only with less than ten tables total so you know it&#39;s gotta be legit.

Isaan Station is know for its papaya salads, no surprise.  The green papaya is a synergy of spicy and sweet.
The Nahm Dtok Mhu is a decent spicy grilled pork in a grainy-textured, slightly under-seasoned signature sour-sauce of fermented rice. It&#39;s better at Ruen Pair but no real complaints here either.

Sorry South Bay, but I can eat just about anything here except the Thai. Whenever that craving hits, I&#39;ll be driving all the way up to Thai Town and it&#39;ll be worth the drive every time."

Finally!  One of the most Authentic Thai Isaan (NE Thailand) street food restaurants in Los Angeles!

While technically still in part of Koreatown, it was totally by accident that I happened upon this little gem.

The menu is only a two-sided long sheet of paper with many of my favorite Northeast Thailand cuisine.

I ordered the green papaya salad Thai style (Som Tom tahm Thai), Crying Tiger of beef (Sua longhi), sticky rice and Thai Iced tea.

I cannot express enough how important it is for Thai food to be done correctly to properly enjoy the true flavors, health benefits, and enjoyment of all that Thai cuisine has to offer, which are many.

Isaan Station/ Thai Street Food Restaurant DID NOT disappoint! 

The Crying Tiger of beef I ordered rare came out perfect! tender, flavorful and cooked perfectly,  which other than my own restaurant and Pok Pok in Portland Oregon this is the only Thai restaurant i have been to that came even remotely close. ..and they nailed it.

The SomTom was one of the best and sticky rice cooked perfect.

Try this place and compare everywhere else to them.
You won&#39;t be disappointed!

I met a friend here for lunch and we split the LARB WOON SEN, a spicy glass noodle dish with minced pork, red onion, mint leaves, lime, rice powder, cilantro, coriander and green onion, and the CRYING TIGER, slices of charcoal grilled beef tenderloin.  Both were great, especially the larb woon sen.  The crying tiger was a bit fatty, but you might like that.  We added some STICKY RICE (comes in an individual bamboo basket) to balance out the meal and I had a THAI ICED TEA to curb some of the spiciness of the larb woon sen.

The mild for Kaeng Khew was pretty..weak but the Tom Saab Kra Dhook Mhoo had a pretty good kick. But regardless, live a little and get Medium! Portions felt a little small too.

Food was pretty delicious - was not a fan of the sticky rice because I had a hard time grabbing a bite with my wooden chopsticks (maybe I&#39;m just a horrible chopstick user).

It&#39;s LA, and it&#39;s vegetarian. So the plates were smaller than what I&#39;m used to, but not terribly small like a certain tapas place I went to in Pasadena that left me wanting.

Crispy Haloumi- I didn&#39;t know what this was when I ordered it. But it ended up to be fried cheese, so basically a fancier mozzarella stick. It was okay.

Oyster mushroom- the mushroom was cooked so that texturally it was kind of flat. The Chinese vegetarian places in the SGV area make fried oyster mushrooms way tastier. But I liked the harissa sauce they used.

Mushroom risotto- they used maitake mushrooms, one of my favorites. It was quite fragrant, otherwise decent risotto.

Moroccan Tagine- I ordered this also and it turned out to be my favorite! Was kind of like a vegetable stew, but usually I hate it because of the tomatoey taste. This one I LOVED. There were raisins apparently and I also dislike raisins but it was stewed and the raisiney taste and texture were undetectable.

Fattayer- it&#39;s kind of like a giant samosa, the kind they had on that day. I judge samosas on how dry they are, but the fattayer was not dry at all. The filling was like a potato pie. Tasty.

Saffron Pudding- I couldn&#39;t really detect much saffron taste. But I liked the pudding and they had some sort of fragrant syrup and mint leaves.

Overall I thought the food was quite tasty, Despite the &#34;American (New)&#34; tag, there was a lot of North African/Mediterranean incorporation. I discovered North African/Mediterranean (not the Mediterranean you find often like falafels, gyros, etc) not too long ago at Bowery Bungalow and The Briks and it&#39;s turning out to be one of my favorite kinds of food."

Highly highly recommend this place. 
The vegan butternut squash daily soup was so creamy comes with vegan yogurt tips on the top. Awesome! Eggplant croquets was amazing. You can taste the chickpea in it and the dressing added more flavor to it. Great job! The house risotto. Oh my goodness! The BEST risotto that I have ever had. It was so flavorful that I could fast the different ingredients in my mouth the second I put it into my mouth. Although I&#39;m not a huge fan of rice/carb, this is a must!

Really appreciate the craft and effort that goes into each dish. Had a dill and lentil salad that came with a very awesome and fresh (like out of the garden fresh) vinaigrette.  The portion was well enough to keep me full after a work out/long drive. The only reason why I did not give this place a perfect score is because the hipster vibe was a little too much. Hipsters will kind of stare at you (or you&#39;ll get different service then others) if you seem to be from out of the area. But, I guess that may be true for a lot of places in general."

We started our meal with a bottle of red wine which was a mix of Cabernet/Merlot/Syrah which was delicious! 

For appetizers we ordered the Batatas which was sweet potato topped with the most flavorful sauces. We also ordered the avocado purée which was a personal favorite! I want to recreate this dish at home! It was made with tahini, lemon, cumin &amp; other spices I could not figure out! 

We ordered the kale sale next which was okay, not much flavor &amp; tasted a little dry for my preference. 

For the main dish we got the mushroom risotto and socca. The socca was way too bland &amp; lacked spices...also a little bitter! However the risotto definitely made up for it! So flavorful &amp; creamy!! 

Service was slightly slow &amp; it took way to long for each dish to come out, however they offered us complimentary chips &amp; dip for the delay. Staff is friendly &amp; the place itself is clean. Ambience is definitely intimate with its dim lighting!"

We ordered the Moussaka and the Mushroom Risotto and had nothing negative to say about the food. My favorite was the potatoes that came with the moussaka. Their wine selection was great too. Really enjoyed the bottle we had.

Ambiance
Tables are small and a bit cramped together but still cozy &amp; romantic.

Service
Our server, the lady with the funky hair (forgot her name) gave us a dirty look when we told her we&#39;re skipping dessert. WHAT&#39;S UP WITH THE ATTITUDE? We figured she probably had a bad night. But rolling her eyes and treating us like we&#39;re no longer welcomed just because we decide to skip dessert?? This clearly wasn&#39;t a pleasant way to end dinner and we left with a bad taste.. 

Would I be back?
Probably not. I have nothing against the food, but no one wants to dine at a restaurant and leave feeling crappy.. A big chunk of a dining experience is the service. 

And frankly, there are enough other options in LA.
I hope the owner of this restaurant addresses this."

This place is awesome, but it&#39;s kind of small, so be sure not to miss it. It is run by former rock band mates, and serves dinner only. It is a vegetarian restaurant, but a good portion of menu options are vegan and/or gluten free. 

Since the room is small, it gets packed quickly... but it is very cozy. Not sure if I was ever disappointed with anything on the menu, but my particular favorites are the olive and dates appetizer, the lebne plate; the vegetarian fondu and the baked sheep feta served inside roast tomato. 

The great thing is you can bring your bottle of wine with you if it adds to a better dining experience. I usually never have room for desert, but I have tried one of their tarts and it was delicious!"

Besides just genuinely loving this place and their food, I also happen to be a vegetarian and this place hits the spot! I&#39;ve also taken meat eaters here and they&#39;re soo impressed!  Most veggie places don&#39;t hit that savory pallet that I hope they will. As someone who cooks a lot , I really enjoy the FRESH Simplicity this restaurant has consistently.

Spices are on point. 

Butter lettuce and Moroccan carrot salad is something I&#39;d never tried until tonight. Was super good. 
(Menu does change as they use the freshest ingredients and use seasonal veggies.)

Cute chefs. Cute servers. Friendly service. 

Really love this place and i cannot believe it took me so long to review it.

Ok, so party of four and we sat by the door on a slightly chilly LA night, so that blew because servers and folks going in and out, not much you can do but deal with it, it&#39;s a small place. 

So the big issues outside of you need to be a wealthy Vegan and I&#39;m not wealthy or a vegan was the Salt in all the dishes, I had to send back the soup because it was crazy salty, they were cool about that and took it off the bill. So we got 3 Risottos, two came, one for my friends to share and one for me. My wife risotto came 10 min later, kinda sucked to not eat together and time it properly, but shit happens. In general the food came out very slowly, but it was a busy Sat night. Overall it can get pricey, it can be salty and slow. Bummer, not the worst experience but no need to go back. Sorry Elf"

I have been a vegetarian for 12 years and eaten at many, many vegetarian restaurants. What I really love about this place is how unique their dishes are. Everything we had was inventive, interesting, and seemed made with love. The staff was really friendly- the whole place had an upscale hippie vibe and I loved it. 

One thing that my date was worried about was that we got there for dinner a bit before sunset and this spot is not as romantic with the lights up. Once the sun sets, the vibe is much more romantic because of the candles/lanterns/etc. That didn&#39;t bother me at all but I thought I&#39;d give my fellow yelpers a heads up: if you want maximum romance, make sure to schedule your reservation after sunset."

We had a nice time. The food was interesting and very well made. Simply looking at it as a place to get some veggie delights, I&#39;d say it&#39;s almost a 5 star. Funny enough I have more complaints than I do compliments, but it still has 4 stars because my expectations were super high. 

This place wasn&#39;t as fancy as I was hoping. It&#39;s all a bit TOO earthy. Meaning the floor looked dirty and the walls looked old. Also there was a plant in my face. I had to switch seats with my date because I&#39;m too tall apparently to sit without being harassed by a vine. As soon as the sun went down though, and we got to see those pretty lights lining the outside of the place, it wasn&#39;t so bad. So I guess I&#39;m saying if you&#39;re going for the romance, it&#39;s more of a 3 star. We both agreed we had good food and a good time, but neither of us plan on going back on a date... At least I hope she isn&#39;t... You know... Like... Without me.

The service was just alright. The waiters seemed preoccupied with their thoughts and they got a couple of my drink orders wrong. But they were knowledgable at least. And polite on the outside. What made me wanna give this 3 stars was the fact our waitress set the bill down so my date could see... Not cool. 

The food was a lot of fun. Everything we got tasted great and had a nice presentation. I thought it was a bit too pricey. Sure for a date I was glad to look good spending a bit of gold coin from my magic pouch, but for what I spent we were both left hungry, and we didn&#39;t want to do dessert there. 

So... 4 stars for a vegetarian&#39;s delight! I&#39;d say 3 stars for a date night! And 1 star if it was my dad. My dad is not a restaurant. Or a phone."

The guy I placed my order with was very patient in explaining the dishes, so 5 stars for over-the-phone service.  I decided to order the kofta with saffron cous cous, which had king oyster mushrooms, yogurt, and my favorite, the crispy chickpeas.  This dish was very flavorful and tasty - a little bit of tartness with the richness of the mushrooms, with a hint of freshness from the cilantro.  I don&#39;t even like chickpeas but the way they put the dish together just worked very well.  The only thing I did not like was the amount of food I received for $21.  I had a good number of sliced king mushrooms, probably 8 slices-ish (which was probably like, 2 mushrooms), but everything else, including the cous cous, was just foofy fillers.  I literally had less than 3 spoonfuls of granular cous cous, and I was left seriously hungry.  I had been a vegetarian for 10 years, so I&#39;m used to vegetarian/vegan foods, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever been charged 21 bucks for a dish with such an insufficient amount of cous cous!  

I am still rating it 4 stars because I think the concept of the restaurant is wonderful, and am always a supporter of tasty and creative vegan/vegetarian food.  But please don&#39;t skimp on the cous cous!"

Ordered two mains and dessert from warm, quirky staff. Great, quiet, beautiful but non-foofy environment.

Kurlu kurlu (I think) ($19)
Described as &#39;stew&#39;. Tasted like tagine. I&#39;m not a fan of sauces usually - it can be devilishly used to disguise bad produce - but this tasted like meticulous care and spice precision. Beans and tomatoes in the stew was wonderfully charred. The &#39;meatballs&#39; were so soft, &#39;real&#39; tasting. On the salty side but I like my salt so it was perfect. 

Mushroom and walnut &#39;bread&#39; main ($19)
I&#39;m OCD with texture and this hit the spot. A mouthful of walnut &#39;bread&#39;, mushroom and soft egg = textural orgasm. The bread was surprisingly sweet but I am also into sweet...and nuts...need I say more.

Citrus curd ($10)
If you are a textural and tang fan this is again a must. Perfect curd (sticks to spoon when you turn the spoon upside down) with fresh mint leaf (a garnish, but I eat it with a mouthful of curd) and a crunchy walnut crumble.

The above make me seem easily pleased but when it comes to food I am most definitely discriminatingly judgemental so seriously, do yourself a favour and come here quick and even if you eat meat, my sources say you will be pleased."

Most of the entrées were around $20, and my friend and I left the restaurant still feeling like we could&#39;ve eaten twice as much food. The food was very pretty and tasty, although I personally felt like the menu relied too heavily on potato as filler. The best part about the restaurant was the atmosphere - - small, quiet, perfect for a date or an evening out with friends.  The servers did a great job, and I left satisfied, although I would probably not go back, as I prefer to get more bang for my buck--if I&#39;m going to spend over $50 for a glass of wine and an entrée (I also shared an appetizer), I want to leave feeling full."

They have forgotten that they are in the hospitality industry and instead decide they think it would be a really big power move to treat people like they are of little value and should be so lucky to come spend money in their business. Due to poor communication we decided to take a reservation at a different restaurant. I replied &#34;no thank you&#34; to a presumptuous email sent by the reservationist confirming a reservation that I did not make but had only inquired about. The manger I guess he was then felt the need to call and harass me about my email &#34;what does np thank you mean?!&#34; he asked me and proceeded to bully me into an argument after I had asked to call back at a later time to explain my decision, which I didn&#39;t even need to do because ...oh wait... I AM THE GUEST. 
When he called I was in a car with my boyfriends family during our first meeting and had to have this conversation in front of them because he would not let me off the phone for the sake of his pride. He argued with me until I told him I wouldn&#39;t be coming back to which he sharply said &#34;that was great with them&#34; and hung up on me. Not only did he bully me in an uncomfortable situation after I had asked him not too, but he felt the need to insult someone he never met and didn&#39;t even try to understand. The truly sad part is that I have been a consultant in several amazing restaurants in Los Angeles and worked at some of the finest establishments in New Orleans, NYC and around the country. I love making people happy, and diffusing bad situations so that people can enjoy THEIR special night and not get caught up in petty unpleasantness. I am writing this so hopefully he can learn from his mistake and become better at his job which is to make his business money by taking care of people not alienating them. I have recommended this restaurant to quite a few friends and guests in the past but I will no longer do so because of this interaction. My advice would be to remember what your position is and if you aren&#39;t happy with that then go work somewhere that makes you happy man."

Also, how did it take me over a year after stumbling upon their first Tuesday night tapas night to return?!  Probably because shortly after my first visit, I moved from Downtown to Brentwood.  Ugh.

Ok, Elf is this super cute little space full of energy and deliciousness next to Mohawk Bend.  About a year ago my friend and I were planning to go to Mohawk Bend for dinner and drinks, as we were walking past Elf we saw it was open and decided to take a peek.  My friend knew I was veg and thought I might like it, but didn&#39;t think they were open on Tuesdays (they usually aren&#39;t) So we stepped in a didn&#39;t step out for a few hours.  They were doing REAL tapas.  Yeassss, real tapas in Spain are where as long as you buy drinks, you keep getting food.  Now, I don&#39;t know if they still do this ever or not, but I will now be following them on Instagram to find out. 

They have only natural and organic wines and beers, all of which are delicious.  Last night I went for dinner and it was a little pricey for the starters, though all were really tasty. The main course was really really great and I didn&#39;t feel it was overpriced by much. 

I love the vibe of this place and the food and the wine.  I will return sooner than a year from now, I promise!"

When I order something with vegetables, I assume they&#39;ll be a medley but it was only potatoes and one piece of broccoli, that bite was great, the others not so much. Also way too expensive.

I have learned to ask more questions at restaurants, if the descriptions are vague. I am looking forward to going back again.

The menu is well curated for vegetarian and vegan dishes. We had vegan Parisienne Galette and vegetarian Grilled Breakfast Sandwich. Parisienne Galette was heavenlicious, and here are the ingredients I had to look up again after the meal: 

*Parisienne Galette - chickpea crepe, turmeric and curry cauliflower scramble, petite smoky mushrooms, leek, epinards (vegan, add egg $2)     12-

The chickpea crepe was nice and crunchy that hugged a generous portions of potatoes curry cauliflower and other yummy goodness. We also enjoyed a side of avocado, pita and gurchens as an appetizer along with a refreshingly tasty and gorgeously presented Bloody Mary and mimosa. The servers and hostess alike were friendly and laid-back. 

We have been at Elf Cafe for dinner more than a year ago, when they used to accept cash only, and didn&#39;t serve brunch. Now they accept credit card too (no more extra stop for ATM)! Also, reservation is not required for brunch, although it&#39;s always nice for them to prepare a table before your arrival if you make a reservation in advance (via email). 

The only suggestion I have for Elf is I don&#39;t need my Bloody Mary to be stiff but it was more on the weaker side; would have liked my Bloody Mary with a bit more vodka. Next time I&#39;ll ask for more vodka and less ice cubes. Other than that, it was a superb Sunday brunch experience. Thank you, Elf."

Today I got a chance to come back to try their new brunch offerings..and yep, still just as delicious as I remembered, except now I don&#39;t have to wait until night time to enjoy it. They just recently started serving brunch (in fact I think today was the first day) so it wasn&#39;t crowded at all. I suspect that won&#39;t last long as word starts to spread. 

Again, everything we ordered was fabulous. The star of the show was definitely the gorgeous pizzetta - crispy buttery pastry with some sort of berry compote and goat cheese, topped with an egg. The only complaint was that there wasn&#39;t more ;) 

Elf Cafe continues to be one of those places I will never get sick of going back to (especially now that I&#39;ve moved away). Their food is consistently interesting, DELICIOUS, and affordable while the service is always warm and kind. Winner winner veggie dinner!"

I can&#39;t really recall what I had, but I can surely said that is was impressive and very tasty !

Don&#39;t mind that all the men working here, not to mention most males that dine here, have most of their face covered by hair; it&#39;s just part of the whole organic vegetarian Echo Park crowd. 

I came here on a Thursday night with two girlfriends around 6pm, and the restaurant was pretty empty. By the time we left, a queue had formed outside the door. The food is very flavorful and extremely well-made. I opted for the tart with blue cheese, caramelized onion, and seasonal mushrooms. I soon realized that the blue cheese was unnecessary because it made the tart a bit too rich and heavy. The tart crust was so buttery and flakey, I was trying to savor every bite. 

They serve complimentary pita chips with a red pepper hummus dip. The restaurant is very dimly lit, so it&#39;s also perfect for a date night. Now I just need to convince the boyfriend to go to a vegetarian restaurant with me..."

Elf Cafe is Moroccan inspired vegetarian food for herbivores who want an upscale dining experience catered to their tastes.

Pita chips with muhammarah -- I was happy to see this spicy North African red dip of walnut and pimento brought to the table immediately.
Spring salad -- Frisee with a FEW olives, roasted black mission figs
Butter lettuce -- This is the salad to get with shaved carrots and microgreens. All salads came with serving spoons to share with the table, though the portions are not huge, so get a few to do this.
Vol au Vent -- I didn&#39;t order these, but a couple friends did, and the &#34;vent&#34; had the wind knocked out of it. These were rather flat puff pastries looking more like biscuits.
Risotto of the day -- This had maitake mushrooms, but the risotto is always a popular dish according to the server, who put on a French accent a few times that night, throwing us for a loop. We were like, &#34;That&#39;s the same guy, right? Did you notice he was French?&#34;
Kofta -- Everyone oohed and aahed when my dish came out, and it was beautifully plated. There were a couple tablespoons of red couscous beneath what was not kofta by any definition. Maybe Moroccans play fast and loose with what they call kofta, but these were mushrooms. That&#39;s it. Kofta is usually meat, but Hindus make it with fish or vegetables. It literally means meatball. There are 291 kinds in Turkey alone, so it varies widely by region. But I&#39;ve never had someone serve me a mushroom and call it a kofta. It was good, but I wished I had ordered the bisteeya, Morocco&#39;s national dish, which the server said veers toward the sweet and savory.
Rice pudding -- Classically prepared with rose water and cardamon.

My only complaint is a $16 glass of pinot noir on the menu seems a bit steep. I got a cabernet franc blend for half that, and it was perfect with my meal. You can find a drinkable pinot noir to put on the menu that would be priced more reasonably. Maybe BYOB since you can."

We ordered a delicious salad with loads of fresh herbs, spices, and lemon juice. It was probably the most flavorful salad that I&#39;ve ever eaten! Along with the salad we had an avocado hummus appetizer with warm pita which was lovely. We also shared a kafta entree, which was my personal favorite dish of the evening. The fresh vegetables were amazing and the mushrooms were the best I&#39;ve ever had. My friend thought Elf was one of the best restaurants that she had ever been to and I strongly agree.

The appetizer we got was the oyster mushrooms which were delicious but overly salty. We didn&#39;t think it was a big deal.. Until we got our entrees.The pasta was very oily we had difficulty getting the pasta with our forks, the crepe we ordered was mediocre, and the pot pie was the only thing we we liked. Everything else was very salty even the salad that came with the pot pie. Maybe I ordered the wrong things.

If it wasn&#39;t so oily, salty, and pricey I think this would&#39;ve been a good restaurant. I loved the idea of all these dishes and the plating was beautiful but I was very upset with how the dishes tasted.

I&#39;d heard great things, though.

My sister and I were lucky enough to score two seats on short notice since the priors didn&#39;t make it to their reservation. We were over the moon. 

The staff is extremely sweet, refreshing, and very accommodating, so I wish we had a better experience with the food. My sister, being a hardcore vegan of four years, found herself very limited by the menu here, which was odd to me since it&#39;s a vegetarian restaurant.
We ordered the $10 almond hummus and cilantro hummus appetizer with gluten free crackers. It was small in size, tasty, but nothing memorable. We also ordered a kale salad, but it was beyond salty and unpalatable, so we had them take it back. Our experience thus far was so underwhelming, we found ourselves lacking appetites, so we just took our checks and left (did leave a hefty tip for their troubles).

I&#39;m a vegetarian so it&#39;s good to have soooo many choices to choose from :) me and my boyfriend came here on a Thursday night! We had reservations which I suggest you make because the place is supper tiny, small and compact! Honestly the place isn&#39;t comfortable to sit in, but their food is bomb! Everyone who works here are super hippie and everyone who eats here are super hipster lol the kitchen is basically in the dining room so at least you have something to look at if you&#39;re bored. 

We got their baked tart and it was the BEST thing on their menu! I got it with mozzarella cheese, broccoli and mushrooms ! Omgggg it was amazing ! The crust was light crispy and flaky, the cheese was ooey and gooeyyyyy, and the salad on the side had a nice lemon kick to it ! Definitely must get this dish if you come ! 
We got this other dish which I really don&#39;t know what it is, but I know it was made out of rice with cream in it! It has crispy onions on top and a yummy vinaigrette! 
For appetizer we got the oyster mushrooms with celery! It had a really good flavor and the celery was refreshing! I don&#39;t really like blue cheese but good thing it was completely separated from the mushrooms and not mixed in! 

Service was great, of course super nice ! Parking is a beezy, impossible to get street parking so we just paid $8 for valet ! this place is pretty pricey, but that&#39;s like all vegetarian/vegan restaurants so you just gotta deal with it !! Expect to pay more than $14 for one dish."

My dear Oscar, I love food! And I have my own business. I know how tough it gets to please a customer. I REALLY am on your side. But I get to state the facts so that your business can strive towards excellence. Aren&#39;t you trying to accomplish that always?

So, this is the menu I was given on the day I came. http://elfcafe.com/dinner_menu

There are total 19 dishes including salads and appetizers. I hope you DO get that appetizers or salad, might not be the BEST idea for a DINNER. That being said, incl. salads and appetizers, there are ONYL  1 APPETIZER OUT OF 5, ONLY 1 SALAD OUT OF 6 SALADS, AND ONLY 1 VEGAN ENTREE OUT OF 9. And I&#39;m sorry, but take this off and it&#39;ll be vegan, is not my idea of vegan food, when you advertise your food like that. You don&#39;t go to a steakhouse and the chef says, Well, there&#39;s the sauce, the gravy, the rice and etc. Just add the steak and it&#39;ll be a meat dish! 

Your restaurant may be good for meat eaters, granted and based on results, you guys must be doing good. I just have a problem with the kind of comments you make, justify the facts that are not authentic and make your customer wrong. 


I was very excited to go to this place after reading all the reviews and finding out vegetarians go nuts for this spot. We went there on Saturday night with reservations and they didn&#39;t have a table reserved for us. Fine. It wasn&#39;t busy, we got the last table that was right next to the kitchen. The tables are too cramped next to each other. We sat down. No one came to ask about water or anything for next 5-7 mins. We looked through the menu. There was NOT A SINGLE VEGAN dish, purely. Out of 15 or 17 dishes, there were only two vegetarian dishes. The portion seemed to be too small for the price of the food. We didn&#39;t even feel like trying. And left without having any food. 

Parking can be really tough. I Don&#39;t think they have valet but the guys next door Mohawk restaruant can offer valet parking."

He had been telling me how wonderful this restaurant was, so I had a pretty high expectation for this place. It did not disappoint me!

The restaurant was packed, but we were seated right away (thanks to the reservation). I got a glass of cava; he got a glass of red wine. We started with Spicy Moroccan Kale Salad, which was amazing and had a great kick to it. I loved the intricate combination of fresh kale with spicy harissa, sweet and mild avocado, and salty feta. I so have to make that salad at home. We also received complimentary house hummus and crunchy flat bread crackers with some lovely spices.

For the entree, I ordered Sfiha pot pie, and my boyfriend got the house risotto. We both love mushrooms, so the risotto with lobster and crimini mushrooms (I think) was a great choice for us. However, the pot pie was even better! The house-made puffed pastry was flaky, buttery, and golden brown on the outside; it was then perfectly chewy on the inside. I could eat that part every day! On top of that perfect puff pastry, if you throw plenty of meaty mushrooms and Greek yogurt sauce into the mix, you would die and then go to the pot pie heaven!! Oh, it was SO good!! Even long after my brain told me to stop stuffing my face, I had a hard time putting my fork down. What is in the pot pie may change daily, but whatever it is, you should get it anyway.

I was too stuffed to even consider looking at the dessert menu, but I would love to go back there and check out other items on the menu."

Sunday dinner special was comforting and so good my friend claimed it was the most memorable meal she&#39;s ever had. Granted, she said that mere moments after inhaling it. But it was gloriously tasty.

Elf Cafe has strange operating hours and it&#39;s closed on Monday and Tuesday. Elf Cafe is NOT on Open Table, but I highly recommend you to call in and make a reservation. I came in here one random Saturday night at 6PM and we were lucky that someone canceled their reservation. The small restaurant was  packed! Elf Cafe is a cute cozy restaurant. They made us sit at the bar, which ended up being a good experience. They have an open kitchen, and you can see the chef preparing food if you sit at the bar seats. The ambient of the cafe is a dark, candlelight, cozy place, yet it&#39;s pretty unique. It&#39;s most likely that you will be pretty close to another party, but it won&#39;t be a big issue.

They served us complementary  pita chips w/ some delicious sweet red dipping sauce (If we knew about this, we probably wouldn&#39;t  have ordered an appetizer because we were STUFFED) Elf Cafe also has fresh rosewater lemonade available! The lemonade had a very faint rosewater taste, but it was quite refreshing. Their vegan mushroom risotto came in a generous portion, but it was extremely filling and flavorful. 


They take a bit long preparing the food, but it is sure worth the wait. I would definitely come here again and try out other things on their menu... JUST DONT FORGET TO CALL IN AND MAKE A RESERVATION! You can also bring your own wine!"

The food is of course vegetarian as noted.  It is hearty, delicious, BIG flavors, explosive and deep.  Big use of mushrooms, kale, tahini, dates, fresh veggies grilled to perfection, great array of well used resonant spices and everything is warm, yummy and well thought out.   The platings are non-pretentious and of appropriate portions.  Very filling.  

I had the mushroom kofta, my wife had the pot pie, we had a few delicious appetizers and their beer and wine menu is solid and paired nicely with their fare.  The waitstaff is way down to earth, polite, attentive, professional and give off a great vibe.  My dish was amazing.  Complex flavors and perfectly prepared.  

Atmosphere is compact, but groovy, warm, intimate and might I say, small.  They&#39;ve added a side room since we were there which opens things up a bit more.  As far as parking, its in the Mohawk Bend section of Sunset, so I would highly recommend parking a little farther west down Sunset and then walk up.  Or - utilize the valet for Mohawk Bend, the restaurant.  I think that&#39;s acceptable.  

Another thing that might be offputting for some is the reservation process.  It&#39;s a little unorthodox for some (send an email, ask for a time, get a reply back, etc.).   If after 5pm, you can call.  That&#39;s what we did this evening and it worked out beautifully. 

Dessert list is usually one dessert that is hand made there.  Tonight, we had a saffron pudding that was KILLER.  Layers of flavor, complex and a lovely end to our meal.  It had salted pistachios, orange blossom syrup, cardamom, rice flour and organic milk.  It rocked my world.  

Anyway, highly recommend this spot.  And its a groovy part of town."

I&#39;m pretty darn impressed with this place; everything was on point. I&#39;ve been wanting to try this place for the longest and finally decided to go for my friend&#39;s birthday. Although we made reservations for Sunday night dinner, the place wasn&#39;t packed at all. The service was great and everyone was really friendly. As for the food: excellent! We started off with a Caesar Chavez salad. It was a great start to our meal; the salad was perfectly dressed and had a bit of spice to it. My friend even commented that for a non-salad eater, he really enjoyed the salad; he actually finished it off when I switched to entrees as they came out. For entrees, my friend ordered the Steak and Potatoes and I had the North African Glazed Chicken. The steak had a peppered crust which after awhile felt too peppery, but the potatoes it was paired with was delicious! It had the perfect texture and wasn&#39;t covered with salt or cheese. Yum! The North African Chicken sat on a bed of Spanish Israeli Couscous. The chicken was tender and moist; the glaze on it was awesome. I was worried that it would be too sweet, but it wasn&#39;t. The couscous was exceptional! As we got full we couldn&#39;t help but shove more couscous in our mouths! Lmao. After dinner we were so full, but I really wanted to try a dessert considering the salad entrees were ALL delicious. We decided on the Midnight Munchies for dessert. It&#39;s a &#34;Brik&#34; w/ strawberries, banana and Nutella inside and ice cream on top. So glad we got this!! Mmm. 

Total for two was about $85 (before tip). Could have been less, but we seemed to pick out the expensive stuff on the menu. I would definitely go again! Although the steak was decent, I wouldn&#39;t get it again. It&#39;s a little pricey ($32) for what you actually get; I would get the potatoes again though. Everything else, I definitely would do again!

Service is very friendly, and the waiter was very helpful when I asked him for direction to an obscure location.

The North African food is definitely memorable, with an egg and runny yolk inside a crispy exterior.  The Spanish choices are more similar to American cuisine, but it&#39;s still well prepared.  The bread pudding is just the icing on the whole dining experience."

We were intrigued by what African/Spanish/French cuisine was so decided to take my brother from out of town here. The restaurant decor was really unmemorable, and the ambiance is just really casual and laid back.  We sat on the patio since the weather was nice.

We tried a number of dishes on the menu: The Guru, The Cholo, Chorizo con Papas Coca, The Shank, &amp; the North African Roasted Chicken. Everything was good, but not really mind-blowing. The Coca was the biggest disappointment. I would definitely pass on this next time since it was pretty bland and unimpressive. The toppings were very ordinary, and so were the flavors. The briks that we ordered were good, but nothing impressive. I enjoyed the crispy texture and the yolky egg at the center, but at the end of the day, it was just an expensive pastry. I definitely prefered The Cholo over The Guru though. Much more flavorful and interesting. The roasted chicken was decent, but nothing I haven&#39;t had before. And the cous cous that came with the dish was soooo greasy. The Shank was definitely the star of the show. Spectacular fall-off-the-bone meat that was tender and flavorful with great vegetable accompaniments. Overall, a tasty meal that was slightly overpriced for such a forgettable dining experience.

Our server for the night was phenomenal though. Charming, informative, and helpful. He gave such a great description of everything, and really sold us on dishes! It was his recommendation to order The Shank and The Cholo, and both were our favorite. He didn&#39;t let us down!"

African, Spanish, and French?? If you have any hesitation about the combination - rest assure they make it work and it&#39;s TASTY!!! 

[Appetizers]
We got the Cholo Brik. We HAD to get one of the Briks, because it really would have been treason to not get the restaurant&#39;s namesake. Kinda bummed to say that I wasn&#39;t too impressed by the Cholo. I expected buttery flaky crusty goodness wrapped around meat. The staff described it akin to an empanada... But the Brik was more akin to a big fried wonton. The meat was a little on the skimpy side, but what left me really sad was that the outside layer was super fried and broke off really easily. It left my plate lightly coated in oil. 

[Medium sized bites]
BRUSSELS SPROUTS WERE my fave!! Surprisingly they were the highlight of the meal for me. It came with nice fatty bacon chunks. The dish had a natural sweetness to it from the juicy meat - yummmm! Definitely recommend!! 

We also got the Pork Belly Flatbread. A pretty mediocre dish. Nothing to really sing about or to complain about. I guess the appropriate word would be underwhelming.

[Entree]
The Shank was hearty and superrrrr filling! I&#39;ve had really bad lamb shanks before and really mindblowingly amazing ones - and I would say this fell somewhere in between. It deserves a solid B for meatiness, bold red wine reduction flavor, and roasted potatoes to soak up the intense sauciness. I don&#39;t think it deserves A-status because not all the meat was tender. The outside chunks were occasionally hard and overly chewy. But once you get closer to the bone, it becomes the dreamy, fall-off-the-bone-melt-in-your-mouth-kinda texture. Overall, it lacked the consistency of soft lamb-y goodness. 

[Overall]
A tasty and different meal from the usual New American restaurants in DTLA. Do come by to give your tastebuds a fun adventure - and GET THE BRUSSELS SPROUTS!! YESS!!"

There were only a few people there when I went in and the patio was completely open.  That&#39;s what I opted for being a beautiful early evening in DTLA.  

After looking over the menu, I ordered the chermoulazino--citrus fennel and onion relish stuffed whole Branzino, baby heirloom tomatoes, chermoula, preserved lemon--(description from their menu).  

The fish was very good and the citrus fennel and onion relish was tangy and gave the fish some flavor.  The only thing that got me about the dish was that it was a whole branzino and not a filet.  I did make it through by partially deboning the fish but there were still a number of times I had to pull small bones from my mouth.  Chemoula is a North African marinade and it was good to try something new and different.

For dessert, I needed to try a brik, one of the reasons I went there.  I got their Midnight Munchies, a brik filled with strawberries, banana, and Nutella with ice cream on top.

Service was excellent.  My iced tea was refilled often and I never had to wait for anything.  I recommend the patio.  It was very pleasant sitting along Hope Street in a quieter neighborhood and enjoying some North African cuisine.  A-OK!"

When we walked to the front door they had this propane powered contraption cooking a specialty African rice.

Updated review:

I ate at Briks again last Thursday September 15th.  I was part of a party of 5 but my party showed up late. The staff were very understanding and still offer to seat me. Granted, the outdoor patio was mostly empty and there was probably only one or two parties inside. But still, any other place would probably insist on waiting for entire group before seating. 

I chose the patio because they have heaters. It was cold outside but I didn&#39;t want our bookclub to be disruptive to the indoor patrons if our discussion became passionate and excited. 

Our table ended up not having a heat lamp pointed towards it. It was on the corner near the front entrance. I&#39;ll remember to bring a heavier coat or just indoors next times. Turns out the people who ended up filling up the place aren&#39;t using their library voices either. lol 

Our server was FANTASTIC! I&#39;m sorry I don&#39;t recall his name. But he&#39;s an African American young man. Tall? I was sitting couldn&#39;t tell. He was very patient, funny, well, well, well-versed on the menu. He made wonderful suggestions for our group. 

I ended up ordering a chicken salad. Quite possibly the best chicken salad my taste buds have ever had the pleasure of experiencing. 

Overall: Love this place. Making it into my regular rotation."

African, Spanish, and French?!?! We didn&#39;t really know what to expect when we walked in Friday into a semi full restaurant. There are both patio and indoor seating with dim lighting and a cozy atmosphere. There is no valet, but that&#39;s typical in DTLA. There are a few lots surrounding the restaurant that are about a two minute walk and average at about $8-20 depending on the day and your luck. Our waiter (can&#39;t remember his name) was super laid back and sat with us while explaining the menu. He made a few suggestions and even stopped us from over-ordering (what I&#39;m pretty much known for). We went with &#34;The Cholo&#34; brik, spicy potatoes, discada fries, the famous shank, and North African roasted chicken.

A brik is a little empenada style appetizer filled with different savory goodies. The Cholo had beef chorizo, potatoes, ranchera salsa, pico de gallo, queso fresco, and egg. It was served with a side of house salad. There was a ton of flavor in this little pocket like appetizer. The meaty chorizo and starchy potatoes with the fresh pico and creamy egg did wonders in my mouth. The crisp lettuce compliments the flavors of the brik. Although I didn&#39;t try any other briks on the menu, I might be stuck on this one already.

The spicy potatoes were just that. Spicy potatoes. They were little pieces of potatoes topped with herbs and red pepper flakes served with a chipotle mayo type sauce. This isn&#39;t an item that blew me away, they were not super spicy or super memorable. But you can&#39;t really go wrong with potatoes, right?

The discada fries. AMAZING. I didn&#39;t even get a chance to get a photo because the second I took a bite I could not stop. These fries top my list of best fries and I&#39;m a girl that loves fries. Five different meats, twenty different spices, cheese and a lot of love topped these crispy fries. They were similar to chili cheese fries but way better. Do not leave here unless you try these fries. 

The shank was recommended to us not only by YELPERS but by our waiter. It was a huge braised lamb shank (cooked for 8 hours!), veggies, roasted potatoes, figs, lavender and red wine reduction. The lamb melted right into my mouth and off the bone. The sauce was tart and sweet at the same time and meshed very well with the meat and veggies. The meat was super tender and the sweet figs and savory veggies were such an awesome combination. 

The African roasted chicken was definitely different from anything I&#39;d ever had. There were four big pieces of roasted free range chicken served on top of Spanish style Israeli couscous,
topped with gremolata. The chicken had a nice crispy exterior and a tender, juicy, meaty interior. It was very flavorful and paired perfectly with the spicy couscous. The fresh gremolata added that much needed freshness to the otherwise heavy, but tasty dish. 

If you haven&#39;t yet been here and are looking for something new and innovative, The Briks is the place to be. I have yet to find a restaurant that is close to having the same versatility of food and flavor as this one. I truly enjoyed the food, the atmosphere, and the service. Not to mention, they have some awesome hand crafted cocktails to go along with the killer flavors they present in the dishes. There are definitely some more items on the menu that stuck with me that I must try on my next visit!"

Not only is that the name of this place but it is also a name of these awesome empanada type of pastries that are super fun to eat.  They are sort of like an empanada but how it was described to us is that they cook it with an egg on the inside.  I could not do the mental jump rope to figure out how that must work, but when you cut into it, out pours yolk and other awesome ingredients.

The cocoas were equally distracting, the best one we had was probably the Pork Belly, so if you like pork, absolutely try this.

We went for happy hour and on the night we went they had a drink called &#34;Poblador&#34; which was a vodka and chai type of mule basically.  It was fantastic and only 8 bucks.

Needless to say between these snacks, the drinks, and the infamous Discada Fries, we didn&#39;t really have room for an entree, which was sort of an amateur mistake.  Fortunately now I have the perfect excuse to go back."

I was initially irritated after looking at pictures of the menus online to see that I missed the $24 price by a couple of months (it went up to $29); however, I still ordered one and it was HUGE. OMG, GIGANTIC. What was delivered to be was the biggest freaking lamb shank I&#39;ve seen in my life. The meat was fall off the bone tender and there was a sprig of lavender nestled in with the broccolini and the sauce was full of lavender. For people who do not like lavender, it probably would have been overwhelming. Good thing I love lavender. Even better, there was plenty of marrow in the big gigantic bone from the honking ginormous shank to suck out.

Oh yeah, I also got a Duck Confit Briks. This came out first, but I mentioned it second because  I still can&#39;t get my mind off of that Shank thing. But, this was also very very good. The shell was crispy and light and savory, and the confit and egg were creamy and thick also savory. I recommend this, but it&#39;s not a requirement. But the Shank is. 

The only thing I wish would have been different is that I wish they would have had stronger beers on tap. Everything that night was like 5.x% or less. Seriously, they needed to pair some 8-9+% beers so it all that Shank meat would be wasted with not enough ABV to sop up! 

Service was good. It was Easter Sunday night and it was pretty empty. Love the comics/posters/graphics under each table."

And looking up yelp reviews led us to this restaurant which boasted of &#34;african,Spanish and french&#34; cuisines! Hard to ignore, my husband and I reached the restaurant and were greeted by a waft of rich and intense gravy-smell... Mmm so promising. 
On inquiring about it, the kind waiter explained to us that it s a thick meat gravy that&#39;s been bubbling away for hours and one can have it served over fries (forgot the name of the dish) , and I will not lie when I say that getting this dish is maybe our best decision in the trip so far! Crispy fries complimented the rich gravy very well. Sadly, from there our meal went downhill. We got the chicken &#34;brik&#34; which tasted too bland, especially after the meat with fries, and we got the lamb shank, which was not bad and not great. Honestly, I expected better after reading the reviews but may be it&#39;s my taste buds or maybe it&#39;s the place, but the food fell short of my expectations.

We started with an African appetizer, the Bougie Brik. It&#39;s like if a spring roll and an empanada got together and had the perfect baby! Hardy savory filling like an empanada, with super crispy skin like a spring roll! I love duck, but the balsamic truffle glaze is the real flavor kicker!

Then we had the Harissa Mac &amp; Cheese with chorizo. OMG Mac &amp; Cheese should ALWAYS come with CHORIZO! What a genius yet simple idea, rich decadent cheese with spicy meat! Mac &amp; Cheese with bacon is good, but with chorizo is superb!

I was already full by the time we got to Entrees. I had the recommended lamb shank (I guess this is the French part of the meal?) and it was fall off the bone goodness! The server even gave me a straw to suck out the bone marrow! Love it! My boyfriend got the Pork Belly Tanjine, super tender melt in your mouth awesomeness.

The service, cocktails, and food here are all spectacular and tapas style dishes here are perfect for sharing~ 

We were seated right away on a Monday night and our server gave us all the information about the restaurant, drink specials, and a breakdown of the menu. 

We started off with a cocktail from their specials, the pistol lemonade. It was FANTASTIC! One of the best cocktails I&#39;ve had in my life. While the lemonade is super refreshing, there is an interesting mix of spices that gave it a fun and interesting kick. Loved it so much we ordered another! 

We ordered the lamb shank entree ($28) to share. It was my first time trying lamb it was so good! The meat slid off the bones effortlessly and it was just this soft, beautiful, juicy goodness in my mouth. It was literally so tender that we didn&#39;t even need a knife to cut pieces off the bone. A little poke with my fork and the meat just slid off! We both came in super hungry and this entree did a good job of filling us up. 

We also ordered two of their briks, which is what they&#39;re known for. They&#39;re basically fried savory pastries with meat and a poached egg inside. We got two of them--the Guru (curry chicken &amp; mashed potatoes) and the Bougie (duck, cauliflower puree, and balsamic glaze). Both were delicious, but the Bougie was definitely the winner. The Guru is drizzled with a sweet tamarind sauce, and it&#39;s a safe but still delicious choice for those who don&#39;t eat duck. The Bougie was just out of this world....blew my mind. 

The outer part of the briks is a light, crispy layer of puff pastry. You cut it open and the egg yolk pours out, and when you take a bite along with the meat, it makes for an interesting mix of textures. If you come here, definitely order one of these! 

We finished off with their homemade banana bread that came out piping hot on a sizzling plate and a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. I ran out of every bit of space left in my belly, but the few bites I took of this were ~magical~. 

Easily one of my favorite restaurants in DTLA and looking forward to come back to try happy hour!"

Considering, it was lunch time and it was pretty packed he always came by making sure everything was good. 
On the con side, another server did keep asking if we were done with our food. I get it, it&#39;s busy. But I like to enjoy my food and the fact that we were continued to be asked if we were done with our food felt rushed and uncomfortable."

Came here for dine la and I was very pleasantly surprised. The only downside was that our food literally took an hour to come out. I should technically knock a star for this but I&#39;ll be nice.
We ordered their roasted chicken with cous cous and lambshank. For appetizer we also had the briks which is an African fried pastry with tasty fillings inside. 

The food here was to my liking because they use a lot of spices and curry flavorings to their dishes. The food is definitely not bland here... that&#39;s for sure! Every bite is just bursting with flavor. I only ordered the chicken/cous cous dish because my hubby wanted the lamb shank but the chicken became the highlight of our meal.

Tasting interesting blend.
 Also got the bacon Brussels sprouts, just amazing! Was not too heavy. 
 The Lamb Shank! Meet just feel off the bone! Tender, cooked to perfection while sitting on top of potatoes, carrots, broccolini, and mushrooms. It was a bit on the slaty side for Me, but I cook my food no seasoning or salt.

We selected Briks based on the eclectic menu posted online in addition to the close proximity to the LA Convention center. We were looking forward to trying some of the savory North African pastries described in the lunch menu posted online. To our dismay we find out that the online menu lunch offerings are not served during lunch?  No savory North African pastries!!! So much for truth in advertising. It really felt like a bait and switch to me.

We were already there and had paid for parking so we make the best of it and order from the almost completely different lunch menu. I get shrimp tacos and a salad instead of fries for $13. What I get is a handful of lightly dressed field greens and two modestly sized tacos. A salad to me includes additional vegetables other that just lettuce. The tacos were fine, but lukewarm. My friend sitting next to me got the Cubano sandwich and fries - both lukewarm. 

The place was not crowded at lunch, so that&#39;s not the excuse for lukewarm food. Much like the incorrect lunch menu posted on their website, it seems like lack of attention to detail to me. The service was pretty good........

So that&#39;s it for me and Briks as I won&#39;t be coming back to see if things are different at dinner as the whole experience left and bad (and lukewarm) taste in my mouth."

Until the check comes. And all of a sudden someone doesn&#39;t have enough cash, or any cash for that matter, and the bill can&#39;t be split because there&#39;s a billion of you guys and the restaurant only allows a max of two credit cards per table. You know what I&#39;m talking about. I&#39;m sure this has happened to all of us. 

So when our meal was coming to an end on Saturday evening, we were pleasantly surprised when our server had no problem splitting the bill among the 20+ of us. And get this! The restaurant did not add a mandatory gratuity for our large party. This has never happened to me in all the times I&#39;ve dined out with a large group. For this I give The Briks an extra star!

Between my husband and I, we ordered 3 appetizers and it was plenty!

The Jefe: This salad was my favorite dish. The carne asada was tender. You can see the corn was roasted and cut from the cob. It had a very light dressing to it. Usually people use the salad dressing to make the salad taste good. But the ingredients in this salad was what gave the salad its depth of flavor.

Disacada Fries: These fries reminded me of the chili cheese fries I would get from The Hat. However, there are a few differences. The restaurant uses shoestring french fries. The &#34;chili&#34; is more meaty. And of course the portion is smaller. Great for sharing between you and your plus one.

Pork Belly Cocas: This was the only thing I did not enjoy. The  dish was bland. I could not taste the pork belly. I understand it&#39;s on a flatbread so it&#39;s not a pizza. But it did not have the correct topping/paste/sauce to flatbread ratio. Skip this."

Originally had reservations at Bottega Louie (which I&#39;ve frequented several times)  but after reading their menu I realized they didn&#39;t offer much for my newly vegan lifestyle. Actually found this place on an ad playing Words with friends lol. Turns out it across the street from my Gf&#39;s loft. And I&#39;ve passed it a 100 times. Butvlast night after reading the reviews we took a chance and LOVED it. 

We were about 20 minutes late to our reservation as the poetry reading we attended let out late. They were very accomodating and seated us immediately.   

I&#39;m vegan and my two friends weren&#39;t but we all had AMAZING meals. I had the African pastry with Soyrizo minus the egg. Can you say bomb.com! Then we tried their cucumber and heirloom salad. Not sure if I was super hungry because I ate every piece of lettuce. And then for my entree Tempeh Cazulea. OMG the flavors were ridiculously good. I&#39;ve never had a meal with so much flavor. My non vegan friend even loved my food. My bff had the Lamb and she said it was INCREDIBLE, must be as a lot of guests had that as well as I looked around to see what others were having. Needless to say I ate every single ounce of my meal . And will definitely be going back. Had the Frenchie something Martini that was super yummy and perfect for my meal along with the Papaya infused water. Darryl was our waiter and he was excellent. Made some good recommendations that were perfect for our girls night out.

We had the house wine, &#34;the shank&#34; lamb shank $24, and the duck confit $14. They were both delicious. I really recommend the lamb shank. My other girl friend and I shared these two plates along with a salad and we were pretty full. I don&#39;t think we even finished the lamb shank. The flavors are hearty and fresh. I really loved all the tastes of the different ingredients merged into such a beautiful blend of flavors that consisted evenly in all the items we ordered. The flavors were so balanced and delicious.

ATMOSPHERE was not pretentious and still of high quality. I invited my boyfriend&#39;s family for his birthday. We enjoyed the intimate setting.

FOOD: If it&#39;s your first time, try the Briks. The Cocas are tasty but not the go to if it&#39;s your first time (unless you&#39;re hungry then order both). The main entrees have premium quality meats/cuts with original tastes - some which need to be acquired. I would recommend going in on The Briks. My boyfriend Jonhatan was all about his lamb.

DRINKS: Jonhatan says to try the seasonal drink: grapefruit with cinnamon! An acquired taste as well, but quickly acquired nonetheless.

DESSERTS: We decided on the Midnight Munchies. In the voice of Jim Carrey, my babe liked it A LOT."

I usually get their briks and the copas when I get here. I&#39;ve never had any other briks before, but I really really like the ones here. The outer dough layer is nice and crispy, not too thick or heavy and it&#39;s balanced very well with the amount of filling inside. I usually at least order the bougie which has duck, cauliflower puree, and balsamic glaze. I&#39;ve also tried several other ones but I can&#39;t really remember them because I&#39;m too in love with the bougie.

I also tried one of their ginger cocktails, the Poblador, which is EXTREMELY strong in ginger. So if you don&#39;t like it, I highly wouldn&#39;t recommend it. Thankfully, I LOOOOOOOVE ginger so it was a wonderful drink for me :)

The ambiance is relaxing and the service was very prompt and polite. The menu has great items to be either shared or just for one. Their Cocas are very tasteful (its a flatbread). The food is well seasoned and te flavors are clean and on spot. Portion sizes is well balanced with their price. 

I must say it was a very pleasant experience and the food was very good"

Surprisingly only 1/3 of the seats were filled. I hope this restaurant does well because me and my husband (and my 17 months old) loved it!

We ordered 2 appetizers: the duck confit and the Tony Montana brik. They were both &#34;briks&#34; -- wrapped in filo pastry sheets is the meat and runny egg that oozes out when you cut into the brik. They were so delicious! I think my favorite was the Tony Montana Brik.

For the main dishes we ordered the lamb shank and the pork belly. Both SO good~ and the meat just fell off the bone...

Service was great, the ambience is hip, but I was able to take my 1 year old (luckily she is VERY well behaved when we take her to dinners) and enjoy a family dinner time with my husband :)"

On our visit, there was one dominant flavor: fat. Everything was oily and fatty. And with that a distinct lack of flavor. even little dabs of sauce here and there tasted like... nothing.  Just imagine! You too can have blandness and fattiness in the same bite!

Now I&#39;ve had brik. and I in no way expected this to be like traditional brik, but, again the flavors were so dominated by oil and little else. The frying was amateurish and heavy. Please, go to kfc and take a lesson. 

We had two of the briks, a pork belly &#34;coca&#34; (that&#39;s some language for tiny pizza I think), and the chicken salad. No flavors anywhere. The flatbread tasted like bread and fat. 

Chevy Chase&#39;s line in Fletch was charmingly ridiculous: &#34;Never mind. Just get me a glass of hot fat.&#34;  That was the only thing missing from our meal on this particular evening."

Kinda confused on the high Yelp rating.

Street metered parking.
Plenty of spaces for the patient folks.

Nice patio area for warm evenings.

Chorizo filling with an egg.
Tasty and freshly fried.

-parking: no valet parking from this restaurant, so you have to look for your own. 
-environment: the light was kinda dim, you can see they decorate their restaurant with some old post. It was surprising that they were not busy on a Friday night. 
-service: it was ok. There were plenty of empty table, I don&#39;t understand why the receptionist put us to seat on the table facing the hallway and the door. I don&#39;t appreciate that. 
-food: it was heavy. We had the pork belly plate as a appetizer, it turned out really heavy for me. The pork belly just some simple fat pork belly without any creation. It made me feel very heavy after that. I was almost throw out after that. The main entree was pork too. It was the pork belly also, but on the menu they didn&#39;t mention which park of the pork. Omg, I was so sick after all those fattening pork belly. I don&#39;t recommend those dishes at all."

The Brik came up as a fairly high rated resto, so I thought I&#39;d try it out. Initially it looked pretty cool. A guy outside the front door cooking up some beef mixture which smelt good. The space inside was open and bright. The server was fast and attentive.

The place did have a strong odor of Pine-sol or some cleaning product. Guess it&#39;s better than not smelling good, but was a little overwhelming. Not knocking it for that, but what I was disappointed in was the food. It wasn&#39;t all bad, but not really all that good. The waiter recommended The Shank, which is a lamb shank. Since I really like lamb I thought I&#39;d try it out. The lamb wasn&#39;t very flavorful, and was way to salty for my liking. I actually ended up only eating 1/4 of it. 

I also decided to try one of the Briks (an North African savoury pastry, which is somewhat like a stuffed crepe), given that it was the name of the restaurant.  I choose the Cholo, which had chorizo in it. This was ok, but nothing too special. The waiter also recommended the brussels sprouts. These too were just ok. They were a little on the soggy side and lacking much flavor.

So as you can tell, the place really didn&#39;t cut  it for me."

We started with the Cajeta Brulee (I always start dessert first.) I must admit, the cajeta is hardly noticeable, but overall it is a delicious Brulee, one of the best I&#39;ve had.  Sweet, but not overwhelming, creamy, and the sugar topping was caramelized to perfection.
 
Second, we ordered two Briks, my partner ordered the Tony Montana &amp; I ordered The Bougie. We sampled each other&#39;s Briks. He liked the fusion of flavors, per his personal opinion; the poached egg married everything together.  I, personally LOVED the Bougie. The meat was tender, flavorful, and perfectly seasoned. Although the poached egg was good, personally, I could do without the egg. In my opinion, the dressing on the side salad was too overwhelming. In the end, we preferred our respective item.
 
Lastly, we ordered two entrees, my partner ordered &#34;The Shank&#34; and I ordered the Chermoulazino (European Sea Bass.) Again, we sampled each other&#39;s entrees. My partner stated that he liked the Chermoulazino a lot more, for the complexity of flavors. For me, the Chermoulazino was overwhelming and not all the ingredients fuse together.  I favored the Shank more, the meat was tender and the overall dish was flavorful; however, it was a bit too gamey. I&#39;ve had plenty of lamb dishes, but this by far was the one that tasted the most gamey.
 
To be honest, we did order way too much food, which made it a bit more difficult to fully enjoy everything completely. I recommend to try this place, at least once, but pace yourself and do expect to pay significantly for the experience. 
 
In summary, we would return. The food is good and the service is excellent. Why excellent? Because the staff are very attentive and friendly, there is always more than one server checking in on patrons, refreshing drinks, taking orders, and clearing tables."

Us two women got the lamb shank which was just as good as other reviewers said!!!  The men got Steak and they loved theirs too.  Then we got 2 desserts which were both awesome, but I did prefer the crème brulee. Our server was top notch!! He was very attentive, made us a new pot of coffee when we asked for regular and decaf.  The place got very busy after 6pm and I understand why.  We also like the cool décor - walls with urban dictionary, bathrooms with fun pics.  GREAT food, service and ambience!!!"

It&#39;s quite close to LA Live and the Staples Center and is definitely one of the good options when you&#39;re close to these venues for a nice, filling, flavorful dinner.  We came for dineLA and got the 3 course meal.

Here are the food highlights:
- The Briks (The Classic and Tony Montana) - The classic has a bit of kick to it which I enjoyed.  The TM has a good meaty flavor.  It&#39;s really nice to see the runny yolk when opening up these savory pastries
- North African Roasted Chicken - One of the best roast chickens I&#39;ve had.  Juicy, flavorful.  The couscous compimented the chicken really well with a spicy, sweet, oily texture.  Delicious!
- Midnight Munchies - A sweet brik without the egg.  Nice crispy pastry with nutella and strawberries.

The pictures of the steak look terrific and I almost got that instead of the prix-fixe.  With the quality that I had at my dineLA meal, that rib-eye is more than likely in my future."

We had reservations for a Friday night and at 8 PM, the place wasn&#39;t that busy even their out door seating was fairly prompt.  Our servers were all friendly and very helpful; I liked how they gave off that laid back yet very competent vibe.

The Briks 
North African appetizers with a Mediterranean influence, these are medium sized stuffed fried pastries.  The outside is so thin and flaky; it reminds me of the guava pastry from Porto&#39;s or Tropicana except they&#39;re savory.  

1. The Bougie - Was too gamey for me so I&#39;m not a big fan.  I did like the egg inside, with the yolk adding creaminess to the whole mess.  It had duck confit, cauliflower puree, duck egg and truffle glaze

2.  Tony Montana - Now this, you gotta try.  It had pork lechon, black beans, mojo and sautéed onion.  Very flavorful, not overpowering in any way, just perfect in its savory goodness.

Entree
North African Roasted Chicken
Funny how this reminded me of chinese roasted chicken.  One thing for sure, this was REALLY GOOD!  The skin was golden and crispy, with the meat moist inside.  I would definitely order this again if I were to find myself there in the future.  I especially loved the couscous pairing.  It was creamy, a tad more on the oily side, but still really good.  

Overall, an interesting find in DTLA."

I&#39;ve never had any type of African cuisine - fusion or not! Simply for its uniqueness, The Briks is a must try in DTLA. I came here for a week night dinner with a large party. I had the: 

*Bougie Brik (Duck Confit, Cauliflower Puree, Duck Egg, Balsamic Truffle Glaze) - It was almost a little too gamey/rich BUT the balsamic really saved it for me. I liked the flakey Phyllo-y exterior. Perfect for sharing between 2 people as an appetizer. 
*North African Roasted Chicken (Brine-roasted Half Chicken served over Spanish style Israeli Cous Cous with North African Gremolata) - DELICIOUS. It really reminded me of the Canto Chicken (Baccali Cafe in SGV)! The skin was nice and crispy. I loved the bed of Cous Cous +Gremonata. Only complaint was that the Cous Cous was a little too oily for my tastes. But, all in all, it was a stellar dish! HUGE portion too. Definitely worth the price - I&#39;d highly recommend sharing this. 

Boyfriend and the MASSIVE lamb shank. I&#39;m not a big Lamb fan so it was pretty gamey to me but flavors were great. Boyfriend devoured the whole thing. 

I also fell in love with the PB Milk Stout at The Briks! Yum.

Too many places opening up downtown and I forget how great some of the places I already visited are. Our visit this time was excellent. It was quite busy, because there were several events at LA Live that night. We were able to find some seats at the bar.

The top reason for the updated five star review was the service. The bartender was genuinely friendly and helpful. She was on top of things. Somehow the chef managed to remember us. I was amazed. I can barely remember what I did yesterday and he remembers people with specific details from many months ago. He came by a few times to make sure everything was great. After dinner he even brought by these amazing fries for us to try. They were covered in all sorts of amazing things. I wish I remembered all of the details, but since they are not on the regular menu I cannot even look them up.

For my meal I ordered the Chorizo Mac &amp; Cheese and we split a side of the Spicy Potatoes. The mac &amp; cheese was fantastic. The portion was good sized, but not overwhelming like other places. The mac &amp; cheese was great on its own, but amazing with the chorizo on top. The spicy potatoes were also very good. The dipping sauce that comes on the side has a unique flavor that makes them even better.

We will have to make it a point to come by more often in the future. The food is too good to miss, especially with such great service."

Came with one brik, entree, dessert and glass of wine for $39. I did take the liberty of adding up the cost of the individual items and was assured it was a good deal. :P

The ambiance of the restaurant was casual and relaxed. I got the cholo brik which was delicious. I will say my rating teetered to three stars due to the fact that the poached egg inside had a portion of raw egg white (major personal pet peeve!). For entree I had the chicken which came with a few different bone in chicken pieces over a couscous. The couscous was something I am hoping to recreate at home...raisins, olives, toasted almonds yum! My friend got the infamous lamb shank...decent had a pot roast vibe with the accompaniments. The dessert was awful ended up going elsewhere after trying a bite of both options. The bread pudding was dense and dry and the dessert brik was greasy and hard to eat. I am glad I was able to try this place out but I probably will not return due to execution."

The bartender was a very cool woman named Melissa. She gave me all three menus (food, cocktail and happy hour) so sad I could only look at the food menu.

Looked it over asked her about an item or two she helped me decide on the pork belly flatbread. Picture to be posted. It seemed like I ordered we talked for a minute about LA&#39;s ridiculous ticket enforcement and here was my food coming out. Mind you it wasn&#39;t busy but you know how restaurants like to take forever just because they can. The meal was good. Something I have never had before but I would recommend. There are a few other things I saw on the menu that I want to try so I will be going back. If you get a chance to go by sit at the bar cause Melissa was a rockstar!!

The thing about this restaurant is parking around it is pretty difficult. This place sill doesn&#39;t get as busy as you would expect it to, so I like to think of it as a hidden gem.

Trust me on this get the lamb shank and share it. It&#39;s a great portion and it&#39;s the best I&#39;ve had. The cous cous that came with the chicken was also really tasty.

I did not need a reservation on a Friday night, which was great since my bf and I decided last minute to stop by. 

The food was delish!! We tried the spicy potatoes, citrus sumac &amp; fennel salad, the tree hugger and the bougie! I have never had anything like this! The potatoes are delicious with a hint of lemon juice. The salad had a the perfect ratio of salad and dressing and the fennel was not overpowering--which is often the case. The tree hugger and bougie are &#34;bricks&#34; which the waiter explained are African sandwiches in a puff-pasty covering. Very delicious! 

If the delicious food was not enough, the decor was super cool, featuring 80s-90s pee-chee folder life images for the menus. There was a pee-wee Herman movie playing in the background.

We sat outside on the covered patio for a nice mixed view of the restaurant interior, sturdy plants on the patio, and part of the downtown LA skyline.

I can&#39;t remember our server&#39;s name - she is shorter with short dark hair, luscious lashes, and way cool/friendly personality. She was helpful in deciding what to eat and drink and I was very happy when she said I could order my brik without egg - I&#39;m not an egg fan. I still don&#39;t know what &#34;shwarma&#34; is but I enjoyed The Dictator. My friend enjoyed her Guru brik, though she said the egg was a little runnier than she prefers.

My favorite dish there was the roasted artichoke coca - all veggies, beautifully blended flavors, nice consistency of the flatbread!

I like how the menus are housed in peechee folders - it took me back to childhood!

I will definitely visit again."

First of all, the booth we were originally seated at smelled strongly of pee... like a homeless person.

Second, they messed up a simple kale salad... how is that even possible you ask? By dumping a handful of salt all over it. Everyone at my table agreed that it was BEYOND salty.

Third, they forgot to bring out my mom&#39;s lamb shank--they brought it out 30 minutes after the other ones. By that time, everyone was done eat.

Forth, they asked me if I wanted a replacement for my cottonmouth inducing salad, I said no, they insisted I try the mushroom &#34;ragu&#34;, I obliged, and proceeded to charge me for it. It wasn&#39;t even ragu, it was sautéed mushrooms.

Fifth, the Brik we ordered from the beginning when we ordered all of our food came out AFTER my mom&#39;s lamb shank, which was like an hour after we had been sitting there. Their excuse was that they had a large order and they wanted to put them all in together... what?

Sixth, it was my dad&#39;s birthday (which we told them) and they brought out a bread pudding and charged us for it.

Seventh, They charged us for the salad we sent back after having 3 bites

Granted, they did take off the mushroom ragu, the dessert, and the salad, but only after we asked. If we hadn&#39;t they would have gotten away with it. It&#39;s shady shit like that I can&#39;t stand.

Oh, and the egg inside my curry Brik was RAW like runny egg white all over the place. If it takes 1 hour to make, I&#39;d rather it be overcooked and burned than raw... it makes more sense at least.

I honestly can&#39;t begin to understand the high rating for this place. UGH"

The Briks has been bookmarked for a long time for me so I was super excited to finally try it out! 

The restaurant isn&#39;t very big but it is spacious. They have a nice patio outside, too. The decor is unique; very &#34;hip&#34; and casual, but the whole restaurant still gives a higher-scale vibe. 

The service throughout our whole meal was amazing. Our server was friendly, attentive and knowledgable. I love when the employees have a lot of pride in the restaurant and its food! She helped us a lot with our choices. 

The food though, was easily forgettable. 
We ordered the kale salad and two of their briks as appetizers.
I liked the salad but it wasn&#39;t anything special.
I enjoyed the briks! Very unique and flavorful. I love runny yolk so kudos to that. A little oily but I tolerated it. 

For entrees, we ordered the lamb shank, the pork pibil and a side of fries. Honestly, we liked the fries the best. Actually, no. The pork came with a spicy corn on the cob (mexican elote style) which was bomb. None of us enjoyed the pork or lamb very much. Nothing was inedible but it wasn&#39;t great. 

Sorry to say, but I probably won&#39;t be coming back!"

We ordered one thing from each section of the menu. For the brik, we had the boogie which is a North African pastry (crispy!) filled with duck confit, a duck egg (which typically comes with a runny yolk) and other goodies with a drizzle of balsamic vinegar. It smelled so good that I dove right in and forgot to take a picture. The taste of it is very familiar and comforting. I can&#39;t wait to eat this again. 

We also got the kale salad which is HUGE. It is good but nothing too special. I&#39;ve had better salads generally. It has quinoa, strawberries, avocado, champagne grapes, etc. It finishes on the sweet side. 

The beef chorizo (no pork) coca was just OK. It is a flatbread dish topped with various tasting items. This one we ordered has an Hispanic flavor profile. I would skip the coca next time and get an extra brik or entree instead. 

For our entree, we ordered the roasted chicken. This was by far my favorite dish. The chicken was brined for 18 hours so it is very juicy. You get half a chicken (4 big pieces) on top of really, really delicious Israeli couscous cooked with grapes, etc. I couldn&#39;t stop eating the couscous. 

For dessert, we shared a brik-like dessert called midnight munchies. It was very good but I was so full I only got in a courtesy one-bite. The pastry crust was very crispy. The vanilla ice cream was melting away on top and the filling of Nutella and bananas was satisfying. 

We had quite a bit of leftovers. The service was very good. They even gave us sample tastings of their homemade horchata and grapefruit with cinnamon al fresca. The neighborhood is cute (lots of people walking their dogs) so we sat outdoors but beware of the fruit flies. Next time, I&#39;ll sit inside. It was also a strangely chilly summer night so if you plan to dine outdoors, bring something to cover up. 

Can&#39;t wait to go back and try more stuff!"

Holy Aioli- this place makes their discada outdoors to attract passerbys. It&#39;s the smartest marketing promo ever since this smells absolutely bomb! Warning: Dish not safe for vegetarians! 

As much as I loved the discada fries and brussel sprouts side. I didnt find the other main dishes quite as amazing as I was promised by my waiter. 

Bougie- The puff pastry was a little too oily for my liking. 

North African Roast Chicken- simply amazing! Between this and the discada, i&#39;m not really sure you need to order anything else. 

Steak &amp; Potatoes- This eluded me. The coffee rub took too much away from the classic juiciness of a medium rare steak. On the note of juiciness, it also was served more medium than rare. 

Brussel Sprouts- decent. A little sweet paired with the smokey savory bacon.

We had a party of four and decided to family style. It adds up so make sure you&#39;ve got a chubby wallet before dining here. I ended up shelling out $50 and the servings are more-so light than heavy."

It is N African cuisine meets modern cuisine with a twist. The spices Chef Mario throws together for his food is so unfamiliar, amazing, and delicious  on your palate. 

Favorite Food @ The Briks: 
The bougie is a stuffed brick filled with duck confit and poached egg with a runny yolk. Need I say anymore? 
The Lamb Shank is delicious (potatoes and carrots included). This dish offers a very generous portion. I have had my fair share of LS in LA but I think The Briks has the best in Los Angeles. Again, I am going back to the flavors Chef Mario infuses in all his dishes that make it THE BEST in LA. 
The Steak and Potatoes is another favorite dish of mine. It&#39;s coffee crusted Ribeye steak with peppercorn on top. I have it medium rare, cooked to perfection flavors on steroids type dish. This dish comes with a side of potatoes on a mini cast iron plate also delicious btw. The sauce on the Ribeye is just so flavorful. 

The staff @ The Briks are so attentive and nothing but good people. Great food and amazing staff here. What more can you ask for?

The ambiance here is unique and nice. Everything at the Briks is like an art gallery. From the brick walls to the 1 of a kind tables with Chef Mario&#39;s clipped art to Norma Jean&#39;s bar is all made by an artist. Our very own artist, and passionate chef, Chef Mario. 

I highly recommend The Briks. You will have an amazing all around experience. I would rate this place 10 stars if I could."

Located in the mostly new South Park district of DTLA, it&#39;s a bright, light-filled, open floor plan eatery with sidewalk dining as well.  It offers creative and delicious North African cuisine, mostly via small plates, but mixed with other influences, including Latin flavors.  We had tender and tasty Braised Lamb Shanks, perfectly-prepared Cast Iron Skillet Vegetables, and an amazing Chorizo con Papas Flatbread (like a rectangular pizza).  Very friendly and attentive service also make for a completely satisfying experience."

Steak (brother thought it was tough)

I considered making an OpenTable reservation on my phone right then so we could get out of the cold and be back with civilization, but my husband was too grumpy with the awful hostess and just wanted to stay away from her, so we stayed. We got the berbere and curry briks and the pork belly tajine, which is such a misnomer and bears nothing in common with a tajine but was still ok. Their take on a moscow mule had wayyyyyyyyyyy too much fresh ginger in it, and was pretty undrinkable. The hibiscus agua fresca was very good. All in all, $80 later, this was a thoroughly forgettable experience."
the-briks-los-angeles-2,Joanna H.,0RmgSJgWsCOufPdp1lWLVQ,"Newport Beach, CA",1,1,1,913,53,alQYWI4YkQQjLwb8ByBQ1g,4.0,2015-12-23,"DTLA has an abundance of hip, new eateries that boasts their own niche; the Briks is among them, having African, Spanish and French fusion fare. My first impression was way off from what was delivered, and in a good way! 

The interior of the restaurant is all about alternative culture, from the cool kung fu/ action movies they play, to the grungey pictures that are plastered all over the table tops - the low lighting makes you feel like you&#39;re entering the underground. From the ambiance alone, I&#39;d say it&#39;s perfect for an intimate date to a big dinner with a rowdy group of friends.

Our party came in during their happy hour, which ended at 8PM on Sunday; they have a good selection of drinks on the menu, but no food. I went with the Estrella while my bf got a Modelo. His sister tried out the Poblador, which was full of ginger and will remind you of a moscow mule. Good choices!

What makes this place ideal for big groups is the share-ability factor. The menu has two sections for appetizers: the briks, which are deliciously deep-fried filled pastries, and the cocas, flatbreads. All of these are perfect for passing around, but they are extremely filling so don&#39;t order too much or else you won&#39;t make it to the entree round. 

My favorite brik was the guru, which reminded me of a samosa with all the curry flavor, potatoes and green peas. The runny egg yolk added a nice touch. The cholo was also bomb - the chorizo wasn&#39;t spicy enough, but it was awesome. Egg yolk really does make everything a bit better! We also tried the Bougie, which has duck confit filling. I wasn&#39;t a fan because the duck was really gamey, and smelled a little too strong... I would pass on this unless you love everything about duck meat&#39;s curves and all its edges. 

The pork belly coca was pretty good. The fat was melting off the meat, the brussell sprout leaves were a nice touch to balance out the fattiness; except, it was extremely oily. It left a nice puddle on the plate after we polished it off... It tasted great, but may look slightly unattractive on the plate. I&#39;d get it again anyway! 

For entrees, I was able to try a bit of everything. My boyfriend has a fairly large family so I was fortunate enough to try almost the entire menu! 

Everything we ordered was to share:
Appetizers:
brussell sprouts (sans bacon) - very oily, but good. It was slightly sweeter than I&#39;m used to, but flavors are just bursting.
mac and cheese - with lots of harissa on top. Nice smokiness, and the cheese pulled apart well. Well-made cheese sauce! 
mussels - I don&#39;t know what broth they cooked these in, but it was so good. The mussels weren&#39;t tough, but they were a little small in the shell. 
spicy potatoes - these have a kick, but still doable. They weren&#39;t soft enough for my taste, but they were seasoned well.

Entrees:
branzino - lots of bones, but cooked perfectly and topped with tomatoes and caramelized onions! Delicious.
half rotisserie chicken - this was amazing. Juicy chicken plated on top of couscous that reminded me of Spanish tomato rice. Well-balanced entree!
lamb shank - i&#39;m not a fan of lamb, but the wine sauce on the bottom was punch-in-your-face delicious. The lamb itself was a bit too lean for my taste, but everyone enjoyed it.
pork belly - ratio of fat to meat was overwhelming, but it was cooked very well. The fat melted right off and caramelized just right. Pretty good dish if you&#39;re a belly lover!
steak and potates - the steak was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The side of potatoes au gratin was delicious too. Creamy, cheesy and soft. 
Dessert:
chocolate cupcake - it was hard, like cupcakes that you leave out for a day or two. We had a bite and left the rest, unfortunately.
bread pudding - I prefer my bread pudding softer and soaked, but it was still really delicious. The vanilla ice cream was a nice touch. The warmness from the vanilla rounded out our savory, fatty dinner well. 

All in all, great spot. They &#34;recently&#34; opened about a year ago, and seem to be doing just fine. The food is fun, unique, but not so out there that even the least cuisine-adventurous person can appreciate it. It&#39;s comfort food from different cultures - good eats!"

Parking:  Took an Uber here because I heard parking was crap.  And you should be Uber&#39;ing too if you&#39;re day drinking!

Food:  If you come here for brunch, they only have brunch food.  We were a bit disappointed we didn&#39;t get to try a brik, but the brunch menu was pretty legit.  I know I said &#34;brunch&#34; too many times.

Drinks:  For $20, there&#39;s no time limit and you can freely interchange between mimosas (girly), bellinis (girlier), and brass monkeys (you might have a problem).  

Service:  Excellent.  They aren&#39;t the type to duck away and hope you don&#39;t keep the booze flowing.  It&#39;s almost a &#34;challenge accepted&#34; attitude.

Three and a half stars.

First off.. Not a typical place I would go to.  It&#39;s a mix of cuisines I am not a big fan of.  The dining area isn&#39;t really trendy but casual... It was playing a team the entire time we were there and the tables are fun with garbage pail kids and other retro pics...

Pleasantly surprised.  We ordered a wide number of things.. Some recommended by the waitress.  Funniest thing we saw that night.. Somebody walked into the glass thinking it was a door.  Oops... That window must have looked too squeaky clean!

The chicken was the best surprise of all... The cous cous was so good (probably not good for you) and the chicken wasn&#39;t dry.
Brussels sprouts were okay... Seemed healthier than the really tasting ones which are deep fried
Roasted vegetables were yum!  If you like vegetables
Wild mushroom ragu...  Delicious if you like mushrooms which I do!
Tree hugger.. Ehhhh... I guess if you&#39;re vegetarian that&#39;s the closest you&#39;ll get
The bougie... Delicious.  Fatty.  We got two... Must like duck.

I recommend that if you are looking for something a little unique in DTLA, you visit this place."

Concept is great 
Execution is divine

Music is excellent - Cymande &#34;Bra,&#34; Air &#34;Moon Safari,&#34; Zapp &#34;More Bounce to the Ounce?&#34;...the soundtrack didn&#39;t quit over two enjoyable, leisurely visits. 

Decor is mega. &#34;The Answer Is Love,&#34; in the chef&#39;s own graf penmanship?  Tables each painstakingly detailed with long-collected pop imagery?  An homage to Marilyn in the bar, and to LA itself in the adjoining private dining area?

Friendly vibe from each and every professional, helpful member of staff?  Capable and enthusiastic service you rejoin with your own &#34;hell yes&#34; attitude?

Food at lunch that refreshes, fills, and invigorates?  Beverages of the day that raise an eyebrow (like spinach-pineapple agua fresca) and whet a whistle?  Dinners that showcase cooking talent, world cuisine, and local sensibility at once?  Desserts you have to strive to try because you were greedy for creative and tempting appetizers?

An owner with a from-there-to-here story of personal triumph, and infectious ebullience you can&#39;t help but catch?

All of the yes - and all of the stars. Like a boss, Mario!  Keep shining."

We ordered 2 briks as appetizers and the duck confit flatbread. The briks reminded me of samosas except that samosas are generally much cheaper and more flavorful.  The duck confit was appalling. I&#39;ve had duck confit. I&#39;ve had other types duck a million times. This did not taste like duck. It tasted like pork. Not good pork. It was like rotten pork. If I was at home, I would have spit it out. It left a bad lingering smell.  Had I been motivated enough, I should have kept a sample for testing. 

For the main course, I had a steak salad that tasted like it was made at a Mexican fast food chain. It&#39;s not bad, just not worth the price. My companion had the lamb shank.  I don&#39;t understand the hype for this. The depth of flavor was severely lacking.   Overall, I&#39;m disappointed by Los Angeles yelpers. They too often fall for the hip and trendy hype rather than judging the food by its merit.   

Honestly, the two stars is for the briks being edible. If you must come here, I suggest you come for happy hour and stick only with the samosas, er, I mean overpriced briks. Enjoy the ambience. And you can say that you&#39;ve tried this place without wasting too much money."

The space itself is gorgeous- open, airy and just the right amount of intimate.  It&#39;s got an urban, soulful vibe with just the right balance of upscale...yet still casual. You have to experience it for yourself. 

You can feel that a lot of love has gone into the place. The owner handmade all the tables which have cool throwback images that will make 80&#39;s babies go: Omg I remember that!

The tables are a great conversation starter if you are on an awkward first date.... girl better make it work though if he brought you here instead of Starbucks. Just sayin&#39;.  He&#39;s a keeper....

...I digress...

THE FOOD. Amaaazzing! We had a ton of Briks: The Guru, The Cholo and The Dictator. We also had the brussels sprouts with bacon...the flatbread...I think it was chorizo. And the highlight.....THE LAMB. OMG that lamb was so so soooooo good! tender, flavorful, heaven. Thank you God for the lamb. As always we were stuffed but had to try dessert...we went with Norma Jean&#39;s bread pudding. It was good. It was good. But I am very particular about my bread pudding. Not hating on Chef&#39;s mama but my family makes it better. OH!

Came here on a Saturday night with reservations and got seated right away. They have HH from 5-7pm even on Saturdays - get $2 off all alcohol!

Peanut Butter Stout Time

Try the Peanut Butter Stout even if you&#39;re not a peanut butter fan! It&#39;s super fragrant and the peanut butter flavor is not too strong.  Great beer.

Spectacular Service 

Our waitress was super thorough with the menu, going through every type of food and describing what it was as well as the options she&#39;d recommend.  Usually they just go over the specials but she took extra care in helping us understand the menu and what to get.

The owner/head chef (I think) came out and chatted with us throughout the night.  He walked around to every table and did that several times, just checking on our food, describing what everything was, making small talk - it was so pleasant!

I Love Lamb

Lamb Shank - best entree of the night. Huge portion of 8 hour braised lamb shank that was perfectly seasoned and tender. 

3 Briks - can&#39;t remember which ones but they were ALL good.  A Brik is an African savory pastry that has a flaky outer crust similar to an egg roll wrapper.  There&#39;s sauteed meats on the inside with a poached egg in the middle, so you have to cut it right in the center to get the delicious yolk evenly distributed.

Truffle Mushrooms - good sauteed mushrooms. Not special, but a good side dish.

Batata Harra Tots - fried wedge potatoes with a dipping sauce. Delish.

Thyme for Takeoff - very juicy on-the-bone chicken served with potato croquettes. Usually don&#39;t order chicken at restaurant because the preparation varies too much, but this one was perfectly juicy and seasoned well.

Chorizo con Papas Coca - this is like a flatbread pizza without the sauce and cheese.  It wasn&#39;t bad, but not a favorite at the table.  Wouldn&#39;t recommend this specific one.

There was a group of 8 of us and we paid about 30 each with tax and tip for dinner and drinks.  Not bad - highly recommend this spot! Get in before the hype catches on and they fill up!"

They keep taking my favorite things off the menu.  First it was a cheese-less flatbread full of artichokes and other veggies. Then it was the merguez flat-bread. And now they&#39;ve taken the veggie pasta off of the lunch menu.  I think it may still be available for dinner, but that doesn&#39;t help me.  

That said, I really enjoy the merguez sando. Nice merguez and also have had the lamb dip, which was very nice, I really like the sauce that comes with the lamb dip.  The seasoning on the fries is great.  They got rid of the merquez sando, but they&#39;ve got a merquez flat bread now.

Also, recently tried the pasta with some spinach, brussel sprouts, broccolini and some other greens. Nice flavorful pesto sauce. I really like having all those veggies in a pasta.  

The hamburger was suprisingly good too. So far, everything has been tasty. 

Service is usually very good."

Went with cheeseburger and fries because I was having a craving and let&#39;s be honest, K-town has no non-McDonald places to satisfy that craving but I&#39;m still exploring the area. 

Burger: Thin patty, packed with shredded lettuce, tomato, pickles, raw onions, thousand island. (Wish I went for the double +$1.50) 

Fries: crinkle cut. Freshly cooked but under seasoned. 

($6.80 total) 

I usually prefer to go to mom and pop shops for food and this was walking distance for me, and for some reason rated very highly. 4 stars? Cmon guys. 

I&#39;d say this is a 2.5 star burger. It gives you that dingy diner style burger, y&#39;all know what I&#39;m talking about, I would have to say it&#39;s over priced and over hyped. Looking at these other reviews I see people getting the plates and burritos, I&#39;ll give it another shot...maybe."

They don&#39;t give you any chili, just a few drops of the juice to make it smell like it. Interesting technique.

Patty was ok if not anemic. I will come back only if I&#39;m dying for a burger and all other joints on earth are closed. Sorry Olympic Burger but you the tightest burger joint that makes you 3rd world class."

That being said, there food is still great! Portions are hugeeeeee and the prices are more than fair.  They still seem to have the same basic layout of the place (with a few tweaks) that takes me back to the days where I used to play on the arcade machines with my brothers. 

I love their burgers, but their plates are really good too! This time I got their beef plate and I loved it.  To those who complain about the food- Try to keep in mind it is a fast food joint so you have to be fair when rating.

We were both starving and looking to save some money before heading off the EDC in Las Vegas this weekend to have a little extra gambling money.

Olympic Burger is a small hole in the wall type place (on Olympic) obviously, and looks like a place that has been in the same location since the 1980s. It has a couple arcade games for a quarter, and the food there is very cheap.

I think a double chili cheese burger or something like that is the most expensive option at around $4.75, and so none of the main meals tend to go over $5.00. To put it into perspective, I got a double cheeseburger, a large drink, and a chili cheese fries for about $8.50. It&#39;s very filling. The portions that the woman gives you are very big, and the burger is very tasty as well because it&#39;s made right there on the grill when you order.

The place itself isn&#39;t the most sanitary place, but I think it&#39;s just some normal wear and tear as time passes. It&#39;s not that bad though. You get a tray, and you can just sit down at the table, eat some greasy and fattening food for cheap. The burgers are pretty filling, and the lady stacks the chili cheese fries to the tippy top of the to-go box. Plus, the largest drink is huge and it&#39;s only about a $1.50.

Take a look at the menu on Yelp before heading over and decide what you want. You can also call ahead and order so that you can just pick up your order as soon as you get there.

Overall, a great place to eat if you&#39;re just looking for large portions for cheap (we all have those days).

Also no cards. Just cash. I think I wrote that in the tip section as well, just in case."

The ownership has def changed for the better. The owner is English fluent. She actually smiles to greet you. 

I loved their ghetto menus, old ass arcades and the faded picture menus. It brings back memories when I first started coming. Nothing has changed!

I&#39;ve only tried 3 things here... the beef/chicken combo plate, fried chicken, and galbi plate (I think it&#39;s referred to as teriyaki beef combo or something like that)

the fried rice is supppperrrr yummy but also supppperrrr buttery, which is prob why it&#39;s good.  my kid can inhale the whole galbi plate by himself, so def kid approved ^^. I always get an orange bang, cuz ordering food from place like this doesn&#39;t feel complete w/o an orange bang :). wish they wouldn&#39;t serve the side salad... do ppl really eat it??  I remember b4 (w previous original owners) they&#39;d upgrade salad w fries for dollar or two more, but not anymore.  good to call in and place order for pick up and if you need to wait, they got some old school video games to pass the time.  son loves this as well.  parking kinda sucks, recommend doing take out."

I&#39;ve been coming to Olympic Hamburger since I was a kid in the 80&#39;s.. known really to local Ktowners only.. the best thing on the menu isn&#39;t teh burgers or burritos, it&#39;s the combination BBQ teriyaki bulgogi beef and chicken plate IMHO. Portions are huge and enough to send anyone into a blissful state of stuffed food coma. What makes a big difference here than any other ordinary mom and pop burger shop is the way they cook the food with a little authentic Korean twist and sensibility. This was fusion cooking way before there was such a thing as fusion foods. 

For instance, there&#39;s butter in the rice and be sure to stock up on the gochujang spicy soybean pepper paste condiment that adds a little fire to the overall deliciousness of the teriyaki plate.. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any MSG but dizzamn it is the opposite of Waba Grill and Flamebroiler so don&#39;t expect healthy, but I wouldn&#39;t surprised if it&#39;s where they stole their recipes from, they still didn&#39;t get the sauces right though.. often imitated but never duplicated.. I often feeen for a plate whenever I&#39;m back on my old stomping grounds.. 

If you don&#39;t call ahead there is about a 15 minute wait for the food to get cooked up, theres old school arcade games while you wait though.. if it&#39;s still the same older Korean couple that run this joint they are pretty nice people.. and I&#39;m not sure if they still do but they did offer a very limited local delivery service for orders over 20 bucks.. Thanks for the years of grub and I&#39;ll be sure to be back to Olympic Hamburger when I&#39;m back in the town.."

It brings back high school memories.

I remember the old grandma and grandpa that would pack our food and then cringe when we asked for more red pepper paste. I went back recently only to find out that the old couple no longer ran the place. You would think that after all the nasty looks I&#39;ve endured trying to get that extra paste I would&#39;ve been delighted to see them gone but in fact I was slightly disappointed. Haha

Nonetheless, despite the change in ownership, the food stayed the same....portions might very gotten slightly smaller BUT I shouldnt be complaining when I never finish it anyways. Love this place. It&#39;s kind of one of those places you should definitely know about when you live in ktown, kind of like your El taurino,  king taco equivalent."

My dad told me that he will bring chicken teriyaki home . 

When my dad brought this home, I immediately knew that this was that &#34;Famous chicken and rice plate from Olympic Burgers&#34;. I remember stumbling across this yelp page when I was hungry one night a few months ago..

The  take out box was double the size of regular take out boxes you see in Chinese fast food places. On one side is a large layer of rice that has some chopped carrots and peas. On top is the chicken teriyaki that was sauteed with some onions and cabbage. On the opposite side of the box were some iceburg lettuce, some yellow jalapeno peppers, and a slice carrot.  They also provide a small container of soy sauce, thousand island dressing for the salad, and gochujang (red pepper paste).

The chicken was kind of dry and overall, the food was kind of flavorless. Portions are extremely generous and can feed 2 people easily. I personally dont like putting soy sauce into my rice (unless it already came out prepared like that), but my dad enjoyed it with some soy sauce and gochujang mixed into the rice."

Yeah, that&#39;s how run down the place feels, almost like a typical south central burger shack.  The food was decent, though not something to clamor or have urges for. My wife had the hamburger combo plate, and they do give you ALOT of food for the buck (her&#39;s was less than 6 bucks). 

I ordered a teriyaki chicken burrito, and the combo seemed a bit odd, but ok.  They just packed ALOT of cabbage in it.  Keep in mind people, restaurants, ANY you go to, the cheapest ingredients they tend to use and over pack are onions and cabbage.  And that&#39;s what the burrito had ALOT of.  Wish it came with more, but you can&#39;t beat it for 3 bucks. 

All in all, i wouldn&#39;t mind trying this place one more time just to try how their version of korean or asian food in mexican pans out, but don&#39;t hold your breath.  I honestly want to just come back because they have some old ass arcade machines that really bring back my video arcade childhood experience (and they street fighter!)"

Very cheap prices. Amazing. Quick Service. Even better. Where else can you get a patrami burger in ktown? Only down side is that it leaves my hands smelling for hours no matter how hard i try to wash my hands, but still delicious. 

Other down side is that they close so early :( I don&#39;t know the reason, but keep that in mind! They close at 8:30pm! However, what makes me love this place even more is when i walked into this place five minutes before they were closing, all the chairs were up and the floor was mopped (I didn&#39;t know they were about to close), and I had come in from a long, traffic jammed drive from school, and all I wanted was the pastrami burger.

The burger wasn&#39;t by any means a gourmet fancy burger, but that isn&#39;t what this place is about. If you want comfort food this burger will fulfill that need just fine. The patty was not dry it wasn&#39;t covered in a bunch of sauce. There were a little too many onions for my taste, but then you just take them off.

The chili cheese fries were good as well. Basic old fashioned ground beef chili, that reminded me of the chili I used to get as a kid from the original Hamburger Habit in SB. A little on the saltier side which didn&#39;t bother me too much.

All I can say is I will definitely be back again especially for a burger, but also to try their platters as well."

I haven&#39;t been to Olympic Burger since they&#39;ve changed ownership, but I was kind of sad to hear about the older couple selling the place.  From personal knowledge, I&#39;m well aware that the food service industry is demanding, and hamburger shops are particularly draining...  but it was oddly satisfying to come in, order and watch the grandmother/grandfather couple constantly bickering at each other.  As if their marital strife were an extra condiment that gave their food such a toothsome quality.

A cheeseburger, side salad, drink and a basket of friend shrimps used to run just under $5.  The portions were always generous and the burgers and shrimp paired together were fantastic.  With new ownership, I have a sinking feeling that prices have been adjusted for CPI (although it&#39;s currently negative) but I just think to myself that it&#39;ll never be the same.

Think Tommy&#39;s style burger.  It&#39;s good.  Their beef tacos are my favorite.  They are $2 each but they aren&#39;t your typical taco truck tacos.  The tortillas are a bit bigger and there&#39;s american cheese bits in it.  What I like most about these tacos is that there&#39;s a lot of beef in it and it tastes good.  The sauce is good, lots of meat, and with some pepperoncinis, mmm..  Very satisfying comfort food.

The girl that works there is pretty/cute/sorta-hot/nice too which is a bonus.  Their teriyaki combination plate is pretty good too.  I always dine in because I like my food fresh, and I wish there were more seating, but usually you can eat with a group of 4 friends since most of the traffic takes their food to go.  If you&#39;re eating alone, there are tables with stools to sit on.  You can have a view of the parking lot, or a view of the wall.  It&#39;s one of my favorite hole-in-the-walls in ktown.

I got the Bulgogi burger. It was different than I expected. I thought it was going to be ground sirloin or beef with the bulgogi seasoning. The texture was like actual bulgogi sirloin strips but still together in some sort of cohesive patty. The meat is well seasoned and delicious. It was chewier and tougher than I expected. Once I  realized what I was working with, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I thought the traditional burger toppings: thousand island dressing, lettuce, tomato, pickle, onion, may not go with the seasoning of the meat. I took off the raw onion, but everything else blended well with the seasoned meat. The fries are frozen and just okay. Please keep in mind this place is cash only."

They were surprisingly not crowded for lunch.  We waited less than 10 minutes for the burger.  The patty is actually shaped from bulgogi marinated meat and not ground beef, pretty cool.  It tastes pretty good too without needing any kind of sauce.  I took out the onion but left the tomato and lettuce in and that was all it needed.  The patty is a little small but the burger&#39;s not expensive at all, I forgot, either $3.50 or $3.  Boss told us we have to try their short rib plate.

Sure, when I went, it was about 90 degrees in there (but 80 degrees RIGHT outside the door). Sure I waited 15 minutes for a burger. But it was so very, very worth it when I bit into it.

When we walked in, I thought it was your typical, little independent burger joint that you find throughout the L.A. area, which are great by the way, and WAY better than places like In N Out!!!   In many ways it is, and the menu has some great things other than burgers, such as teriyaki plates, teriyaki burgers, bulgogi burgers, etc.  And as stated, the portions are pretty big on most things.  We got the combo plate of teriyaki chicken and beef and it was probably big enough for 2 or 3 people!   Pretty good!  Also got a bulgogi burger, which was great!!  

But unlike most of the little burger joints, the burgers here are just OK.  The taste is just as great as most places, but it&#39;s probably one of the few things on the menu that isn&#39;t big as far as the portions.  But I guess that&#39;s why it&#39;s so cheap for only $2.50.  Maybe I have to get the double burger next time!

I will definitely will be back again!  But probably only if I&#39;m in the area.  It&#39;s located at a pretty congested part of K-Town, which I try to avoid.  It&#39;s in a fairly big strip mall, but with all the other businesses there as well, parking can be pretty horrible!

- cheeseburger - a little cold, ok size, flavor was average. Nothing I would rave or recommend, sadly I was looking forward to a much bigger burger.
- fish sandwich - quite good! Tender, good flavor, not dry, good size, just what I was looking for.
- beef teriyaki sandwich - good size, meat was tender, not chewy nor fatty, teriyaki sauce was not overwhelming at all, not sweet just a. Hint of that flavor which was perfect, a bit on the dry side but nothing a drink of water won&#39;t help.
- fries- magnificent! Very large portion, not salty, not oily, crispy and delicious.

For only $11 bucks you get like 6 pieces of kabli, salad, rice, and the bimbibab red, spicy sauce.  While a lot of you might think $11 bucks is expensive - trust me its worth it just not to eat McDonalds or other fast food or on campus where a salad is going to run you $6.  And really, they do cook the kabli really well, no different than at a good Korean BBQ.

It may sound questionable but Koreans and Mexicans know how to eat.  I&#39;m not going to detail this burrito because words cannot describe the explosion of all things wrong tasting oh so right on the unsuspecting palate.  
Serious yelpers need show up only.  Try to go with two people so someone can sit in the car while the other person runs in to order/get the food.

My brother used to walk miles from church to pick up these HUGE yakirritos. hahahaha

Remember to take cash and to go hungry.  The one suggestion I would have is to ask them to go light on the cheese.

I ordered a teriyaki burger and onion rings for a little less than $7.00, which is a pretty good deal in my book.

The teriyaki burger was decent.  It came with shredded lettuce, which I absolutely loved.  They added a little too much mayo for my taste.  The burger patty wasn&#39;t the best quality meat, but it was thick and flavorful.  I wouldn&#39;t hesitate ordering the burger again.

As for the onion rings, they were mediocre at best.  They tasted very similar, although a little better, than Burger King onion rings, which doesn&#39;t say much.

The BBQ chicken and BBQ beef plates were prepared in a unique fashion.  First, they cooked the meat on an electric grill.  Second,  they mixed together on the grill the grilled meat, some vegetables, and rice, while drizzling soy sauce over the mixture while cooking it.  This created really flavorful rice.  The portions were really large as well.

It also came with a little cup of salsa, which was okay. I thought the potatoes were undercooked as well. Overall, the burrito was okay and only reminded me why I didn&#39;t like burritos in the first place. I only ate half of it though and was stuffed. The good thing was that they cut the burrito in half for you already, so that made it a little less messy. Overall, nice little spot with filling food.

The biggest plus is that there&#39;s free parking in the back, which is very rare to find in this neighborhood."

This will definitely be a staple in our HLP lives going forward.

My boyfriend got the breakfast burrito and I opted for the bacon breakfast panini (swapped ciabatta for a bagel, A+ choice would recommend). We both got iced coffees (which were quite large, yay for caffeine!). After ordering we grabbed a table outside (warm if it&#39;s extra sunny; perfect if you&#39;re working on your tan) and our food was delivered just a few minutes later. The staff was very attentive and speedy the whole time with any of our requests.

Both of our meals were soooo delicious. The breakfast burrito is sizeable and could definitely be split between two people. Our server said the chorizo is their best seller, so that&#39;s what we got, and it did not disappoint. The burrito comes with a tasty side of salsa that, when dumped all over the cheesy potato-y burrito is divine. The panini was also a relatively large portion (we ate around 10:30 and both of us skipped lunch that day because we were still so full!) and stuffed with fresh veggies (spinach, tomatoes, roasted red peppers), egg, cheese, and bacon. I couldn&#39;t stop &#34;yummmmmmm&#34;-ing the entire time I was eating.

The restaurant itself is very clean, and although the inside offers up pretty close quarters, the outside dining option is also very lovely. I did lots of spying on fellow diners while we ate, and I can&#39;t wait to come back and try the chicken and waffles, french toast, and more!"

The food was absolutely delicious! I really enjoyed the lettuce taco&#39;s, and my friend&#39;s flatbread was really tasty. Customer service was great, they seem to value every customer and cared if we were enjoying their experience. The only downside: wait time. We waited close to 30min. for our food. That&#39;s really unacceptable to me. I think they knew they were running slow in the kitchen, and were pretty apologetic about it. Overall, good area, great food, easy seating, long wait for food. 4/5"

The Wombo Combo ($10 something with tax) is essentially a thick, cinnamon waffle topped with fruit, whipped cream and chicken tenders with a churro exterior. Syrup comes on the side. This plate is more on the sweeter side (the chicken was covered in cinnamon sugar!) and the portions are huge. Such an interesting meal to try.

Service was great. The chef in the back came out to check on me frequently, which was sweet of him. (Although I was eating alone inside the restaurant, so maybe he just felt bad for me lol)

The place is a little small, but there is outdoor seating available. The decorations inside are so cute and homey.

There is free parking behind the building!"

The food on the menu are relatively cheap and most of the items are $10 or less! I ordered the breakfast bacon panini. It was pretty good, and they gave me a lot of bacon. I only got through half of my panini because I was full on just half of it. The Wombo Combo seem pretty good, since I tried a little of it off of my friend, but it was too sweet for my liking. I still recommend their more savory breakfast paninis. There&#39;s also limited seating inside, and more outdoors, but it does get pretty hot outdoors."

We were checking out open houses in the area, and needed to find a brunch spot. Carlie&#39;s is also dog friendly, so it was perfect for our little furbaby. The patio was nice and spacious. Only complaint is, they don&#39;t have trash cans outside. There were tons of little napkins blowing all over the floor.

I ordered the fish tacos and the fiance got the tuna sandwich. We shared an aqua fresca, but I wish I had my own. It was SO good! But then again, what&#39;s there not to like about aqua fresca?! The fish tacos were presented so pretty (see pic). I loved all the vibrant colors. But most importantly, it tasted just as good! The tuna sandwich was a little too mayo-y for the fiance, but perfect for me because I love mayo!

They offer both Tapatio as well as Cholula hot sauces and do not offer tobasco sauce. I&#39;m not a fan of tobasco sauce so no love loss there. The food was a descent quality. They could expand their menu a bit. I was satisfied with what I ordered. It wasn&#39;t the best breakfast burrito I have ever had but it was enjoyable. This is a moderately priced, descent quality, cooked to order restaurant. I recommend it if your in the area and want some breakfast. Coffee was good but just average.

I was having my car worked on at uneek down the street and I walked to Arco iris but it was closed.  So I walking back towards the auto shop I saw a man under an umbrella stuffing down some tasty looking waffles colorful fruit topped waffles. I had to give it a try because the guy was killing his plate with authority.
   
I walked in for breakfast and ordered the chicken and waffle. But check this out &#34; Churro chicken, topped with fruit, fresh whipped cream, and pecans. Broooooo!!! Lol. The total came to $14 because I ordered a extra large Jamaica.
 
 I sat outside and the food came out 5-10 mins later. The waitress/cashier brought me this big a** bohemoth of a chicken and waffle plate. I didn&#39;t know where to star, so I just decided to get a little of everything with one bite. This thing was so f**king good I had to stop and do a snap chat review half way through. The combination of the brown sugar from the Churro chicken, syrup, fruit, and Chulola hot sauce sounds sketchy but turned out to be fire. 

  Jesus Christ good job!! Only think that I was mad about was not being able to leave a tip due to not having cash. I will be back to try the brioche waffles!!"

It is a really small cozy restaurant with exterior seating, and it is really easy to miss the place when you are zipping down the street to miss the little sign that says Carlies!  I was able to locate street parking in the front and they also have a parking lot to the side.  It was not that busy when I got here, but there was enough people outside enjoying the various breakfast entrees and coffee, so I was really excited to try out their special Wombo Combo, which featured waffles, fruits, and churro styled chicken on the top.  

People really enjoy the food here because as I was about to order, a patron who was leaving actually walked in to tell the server how much they enjoyed the food!  They had a decent sized menu here but only serve breakfast/brunch until 12pm and then it is their lunch menu.  I quickly ordered the Wombo Combo and Lemon Ricotta Poppyseed Pancakes.  After finding a table outside, both entrees were brought to us within 15 minutes and they were really bigger then I thought!  The Wombo Combo was huge and can probably be shared between people.  The server also dropped off a container of syrup and off we went into the food!

The Lemon Ricotta Poppysee Pancakes was very tasty and each bite had the savory crunch of poopyseeds.  Although, the pancakes were a lttle on the soft side for me, it was delicious nonetheless, and definitely an entree I would recommend to try at least once.  The best part of the meal was the Wombo Combo.  Pouring a little drizzle of syrup on a piece of cut waffle with pieces of fruits and the churro chicken created an explosive mixture of flavors in your mouth that somehow oddly worked well together.  The waffle was light, fluffy and the churro chicken was unique because the interior tasted like chicken while the exterior tasted like a churro.  Combine eveything together, and you get an absolute golden combination of flavors.  

I will probably come back in the future for the Wombo Combo, give it a try and you will not reget it!"

Carlie&#39;s is definitely on its way to being a well-known restaurant in the Highland Park area. The decor is cute and modern, with some finishing touches still yet to occur (i.e., getting rid of graffiti, larger menu, etc.) It has both indoor and outdoor seating and a parking lot out back. The guy who took our order, who I&#39;m assuming is the owner, was really friendly and he let us sample the Agua frescas. Today they had cucumber, and pineapple/spinach - both were super refreshing but the pineapple spinach won :) I literally want to drink that now every day haha.

As for food.....epic drool factor. My bf had the wombo combo which is a churro fried chicken on top of a waffle with fruit. LIFE. CHANGING. I know Roscoe&#39;s is the king of chicken and waffles but Carlie&#39;s might be the queen ;) it was so decadent and fresh.... i had the breakfast burrito with sausage that came with a really great homemade salsa. It could have used an avocado maybe but it was still really flavorful and filling.

They have a brunch menu and lunch menu. The guy at the counter was very friendly. You can tell that they are still trying to work out their flow since they only opened 5 weeks ago.

Wombo Combo - Churro chicken on top of a house waffle! Yes, churro chicken. They seasoned their chicken tenders in cinnamon and sugar. They still have a slight savory taste and the cinnamon flavor was subtle. The tenders were crispy and juicy, fortunately not dry. The waffle was good but seemed a little bit thick for my taste. I liked the fruit toppings which gave it a touch of sweetness. Definitely a big portion that could be shared!

So, listen, America. I get it. This is breakfast. We don&#39;t have the fast and loose zaniness that accompanies an impromptu beach picnic at dusk, or a meandering afternoon stroll whilst sipping an almond milk horchata latte.

Carlie&#39;s Cafe just opened in February and business is good! They are soon to be one of the leading brunch destinations in HLp. 

The owners (Carlos + Leslie = Carlie) are the sweetest people. They offer such a variety of dishes to try and their open every day from 7:30-4:30 pm. Carlie&#39;s Cafe has a cute little front patio for outdoor seating. Although, indoor seating is small; the place is cool in temperature and comfortable. 

While I was there I had my heart set on the Wombo Combo which is churro coated chicken on a waffle topped with fresh fruit :::drool::: However, if the owners fave dish is the Brioche French Toast; then that&#39;s what you try, first! What can I say? It was delicious and cooked perfectly! 

The Brioche French Toast is filling and shareable! It&#39;s 4 pieces of French toast topped with peach brandy seasonal fruit compote. The bread wasn&#39;t soggy, and edges were still firm. The dish is topped with nuts, powdered sugar, and served with syrup. The peach brandy seasonal fruit compote was on the sweet side and syrup wasn&#39;t/isn&#39;t necessary. 

Aside from breakfast, the next popular item on the menu was Carlie&#39;s fish tacos! The fish was tempura style batter fried and delicious. The fish they use for their tacos is tilapia. The tacos are dressed with aioli sauce and citrus jicama slaw mix. I spy slivers of mango. Don&#39;t ask! But it works! The combination was refreshing, filling, and their green sauce was perfection.

Small place with few tables inside and some patio seating. There&#39;s no public restroom though.  Little bit of a wait though for our food to come out. 

Wombo Combo (churro styled fried chicken and waffles)-
Delicious and filling, however my strips of chicken were nothing compared to the other pics, as there were 4 small strips. So I wish those were bigger.  But I would get it again since I live closer to here than to Roscoe&#39;s. 

Machaca breakfast burrito- so so, nothing to rave about, but nothing to complain about either. 

Agua frescas- spinach and pineapple or cucumber...both were good and refreshing!"

If not for Yelp, I would&#39;ve kept driving past.   I probably shouldn&#39;t write this review because though well-populated, I don&#39;t want it to get too crowded but I want to be a good Yelper.

I had the Wombo Combo (churro chicken with waffles topped with fruit) and the lemon poppyseed pancake.  Not a huge fan of churros mixed with chicken and next time I&#39;ll ask for it without the sugar and cinnamon, but the chicken itself was delicious and so was the waffle - crispy and thick.  The pancakes could use a bit more air but the flavors were there.  

Service was friendly and attentive.  A couple of small helpful hints for the owners is to make sure the tables are wiped down after the guests leave and to always have someone at the counter to take orders.

That said, I love the ease of parking with the lot in the back, the elevated patio seating, the reasonable prices - it came out under 20 bucks, I&#39;m a fan!"

I placed my order at the counter: an iced coffee and the lemon poppyseed pancakes. I took a seat outside under an umbrella.

The iced coffee was damn good. I take my coffee black because Im a bit of a coffee snob. I tried my friends hot coffee and it tasted too &#34;bright&#34; for my liking, AKA it was a very acidic and lemony blend. I would not recommend the hot coffee, but the iced coffee was MONEY!

The food arrived fairly quickly, maybe about 10 minutes.  My pancakes were good, a tad bit floppy and soft, so if you&#39;re into textures, you&#39;d be a bit disappointed. I didn&#39;t mind, though, and the lemon poppy flavor was nice. The pancakes had a candied lemon zest topping with sliced bananas. Pretty nice, but I wish there were more lemon zest. I think the ingredients were not as fresh as they could be, but it was still a nice dish with a fresh concept.

My friend had the churro chicken and waffle. It was a nice sweet chicken flavor (tasted like a churro!) and a semi-crispy waffle underneath and topped with (definitely not fresh) strawberries. It was okay. I think it was a bit too sweet for my liking since I like the savory chicken and sweet waffle combo.

The service was excellent, since the worker checked up on us constantly to make sure everything was good. 

I would come back here for the iced coffee and the pancakes.

I noticed that the cafe got really crowded towards the end of my meal around 10:30 so I would recommend coming early if you want a nice shaded seat!"

It&#39;s easy, many of the main food items aren&#39;t prohibitively expensive and the customer service is great. The interior is nice but it feels personal and not out of place in HP. 

The bacon breakfast panini was insanely delicious! Well constructed, they used a thick ciabatta which made me wary at first, but after taking a bite I understood why. The eggs, roasted tomatoes, bacon aioli and swiss cheese and greens melted into the bread. No mess for such a thick sandwich, and consistent perfect bites. You get all this for 5 dollars and change. 

They clearly care about what they put out. Be ready to wait for just a moment, and you won&#39;t regret it."

So far I&#39;ve tried their breakfast burrito, Greek and quinoa salad, and churro chicken n&#39; waffles. They were all GOOD but in the beginning, I found it interesting to see the churro chicken and waffles on the menu. My roommate ordered it and I had to be freeloader judging from the look of my face hawk eyeing her food. So she asked me if I would like a bite from her plate. To describe my eating experience of this item, the chicken was perfectly seasoned with sugar and cinnamon that is surprisingly juicy and tender. So tender that when I took that first bite, I thought I was taking a bite out of heaven. In addition, It is a perfect match with the buttery waffle and maple syrup. 


         Now this is just my opinion and so far people are loving what this cafe has to offer. It just might be all about the hype but I&#39;m just telling the truth. I highly recommend this place."

Yes we&#39;ve tried a few! 

Their menu has a nice range, not overwhelming, REASONABLY priced= made fresh!! We are always willing to wait that extra bit of time knowing its being cooked from fresh ingredients. It&#39;s nice knowing it&#39;s family owned, you can tell they put a lot of care with their guests &amp; plates"

By boyfriend got a breakfast burrito, which was not so good. It was actually watery (eggs looked undercooked) and looked gross. I didn&#39;t even want to try it. Poor guy lol. I think this was because they messed up and gave our order to someone else who got there after us. We waited a looooooong time for our food. When my boyfriend asked for our order they freaked out and we&#39;re super apologetic, and then they rushed to make it, which is probably why his burrito sucked and was undercooked. Not sure if we&#39;ll go back, the french toast looked good so maybe we&#39;ll give it a 2nd chance one day for that."

But it was THAT delicious that I forgot to snap it. Relatable right? ANYWHO, I don&#39;t want to over-hype it &#39;cause I know how everyone has their own set of taste-budded opinion(s). But what I will say is that you will get what you paid for. Everything is under $9! Can it get any better? Why YES, it does! Let me tell you that my fav absolute FAV are the fish tacos! I fuckin&#39; hate fish dude! But are you kidding me?! After my friend gave me a taste I HAD to buy them. They are tempura-style fried fish topped off with jicama- mango slaw mix and drizzled Aioli sauce. I don&#39;t even know what the hell Ailoi was, but it tasted gooood man! They were like $6.99 for 3 pretty big tacos. (NOT the small frilly ones.) This is a NEW gem in Highland Park that not a lot of people have been too, but once you go there, you&#39;ll want to go there often. If you&#39;re a local like me, then it&#39;ll be your usual meet up place for lunch with some friends haha. Only down-side is that they close at 4pm :( Another up-side is that everything is made to order, so please have patience when you order something cause it&#39;s being made FRESH. The cook and cashier came to make sure everything came out to my needs and were like internally and externally happy when i complimented them on their delicious food and customer service. They are super nice!! OH and try their spinach w/ pineapple Agua Fresca! Its delicious as hell and super popular! Dass it! *Drops the mic*"

Upon arrival I realized I had been here before when this place used to be mariscos  sinaloa,which was pretty terrible. I&#39;m glad it&#39;s something new! I love their outdoor terrace seating above the street.
The menu here is RIDICULOUS, I love it so much....you can get peach brioche French toast, fish tacos,pastas, paninis, machaca burritos,creative salads,etc. I ordered the lemon poppyseed pancakes and something so complicated that they didn&#39;t even know what they made and I didn&#39;t even know what I ordered lol I basically told them that I wanted the garlic olive oil pasta with pesto, the guy was like which pasta do you want and I said something along the lines of make the 2 pastas into one dish and with a big smile he was confused but went to the cook and conjured up some amazing concoction lol he was so super cool and easy going.
My bf got the text mex salad with some dressing or salsa that was super bombezzy and a bacon panini. Before you say &#34;oh damn portions must be small....&#34; they&#39;re decent sized, we&#39;re just the most starvingest couple you&#39;ve ever met. I&#39;m so glad he stopped me from ordering the fish tacos haha I&#39;ll save those for next time. The blonde lady here is also way cool, she might be THE carlie? I loved that I didn&#39;t ask for anything here, all hot sauces and chili flakes were all brought out autonomously. I was so stoked about this place I took a menu and ended up gushing about it to the front desk at the doctor, they seemed excited to have a new place for lunch!"

In the sea of AYCE Korean BBQ available in Ktown, you tend to stick to the couple that you know. But our usual spots were overflowing, so we gave this unassuming spot spot a chance. And I am so glad we did.

Hands down, the best service I&#39;ve had! Our server was super friendly, and was coming by at least every 10-15 minutes to check on us. 

We stuck with the lowest tiered menu, but still had about 20 menu items to choose from. DEFINITELY get the red wine pork belly. It was delicious. The color is a little...off. And the cook won&#39;t be as obvious, so leave it on a couple of mins more just to be safe. The cripsy rice cakes were okay; too much sauce though.

Our visit fell during the week of Thanksgiving, so the usual dinner rush that I feel like I would normally see around 7:30 wasn&#39;t too bad. We only waiting about 25 minutes or so. But after we had finished our meal, the wait had at least doubled by around 9:30 so this might be more of a late evening spot."

Not only that, the way they marinated their meat is really a joke. Their house signature bulgogi tastes so bland and fake I was blown away by how bad it is. It&#39;s a disgrace that a place called Bulgogi Hut can&#39;t even make a legit bulgogi....sigh.

They also have very bad customer service. Their main goal is for you to eat as fast as you can so they can kick you out and bring in next customers. 

They also make it seem like there is a long line but when you actually go inside there are so many empty tables....it&#39;s just a scheme to make it seem like it&#39;s a bumping place when in fact that is clearly not the case.

If you want real, authentic Korean BBQ experience, I recommend you avoid this place at all cost."

Came here again, this past Thursday, decided to give this place a try again. Another epic failure! We sat down ordered everything we wanted and they only allow three meats to be served at a time. Wow. Then we ordered rice for the whole table, and never got it. We kept reminding the waitress and asked another 15 times for it and didn&#39;t get until the we were practically finished eating. Thanks for your service. We spent more time waiting for our stuff to be brought than eating. And then we get told that our two hour limit was up and we needed to leave. We weren&#39;t even full yet. If I was allowed to say inappropriate things in this review, there would be a better review. Will not ever come here again and will tell everyone I know that asks me about a place to go for Korean BBQ, this place will never come up. And if someone asks me if this place is good, I will direct them to a better place with better service. Red castle in Rowland heights is so much better and better pricing too. And they don&#39;t kick you out after a time limit. 







Never coming here again! The service is horrible, and when they say they close at midnight, they really close at midnight. They do all they can to make sure you leave before then. While we were eating, it was 40 mins before closing and this lady comes by to give validation and tell us how to validate our parking, if you parked in the structure. She came back 20 mins later to say that the validation expires at 11:59pm and that after midnight the parking garage will charge you $16. She couldn&#39;t have said that the first time she came by to talk about the validation?! They sure want you out by midnight. The food was good which is why I will give them one star, but I won&#39;t come back here for the service. I have been to so many Korean BBQ places and I will definitely stick to those, and will not recommend anyone here ever."

At around 5pm on a Saturday, a crowd was already beginning to form.  Luckily, the restaurant is a lot bigger than it looks from the outside.  We only waited 5-10 minutes for a table for 2.  Inside, it&#39;s as smokey as expected and they play a funny mix of Korean pop and hip hop. 

The great thing about this Korean BBQ is that they have 3 menu options, so it&#39;s up to you how much you want to spend.  I just wanted to try the basics, so we went with option A ($15.99/ 20 items).  But they also have option B ($17.99/ 30 items) and option C ($24.99/ 42 items).

Of the side dishes, my favorites were the pickled cucumbers, macaroni potato salad and glass noodles.   The salad was good too, but we had to ask for it which was weird.  For the meats, we got the Signature Bulgogi, Brisket, Pork Belly, Marinated Chicken and Beef Belly.  The chicken was tasty and the beef belly was fatty but good.  Everything else was okay, but could&#39;ve used more flavor.

They give you a two hour time limit, but the service is pretty quick.  If I&#39;m ever in the area, I would come back again to try a higher tier menu and to give corn cheese a try even though it sounds gross."

I&#39;ve gone twice now and I will become a regular. The quality of their brisket is A+ and they have 3 different flavors of pork belly (unmarinated, red wine, and garlic)  on the cheap menu!!!! Their house marinade is also pretty good (love the squid). 

Service here is great for a cheap kbbq place (and i&#39;ve come with non-koreans everytime!) They will come over and help cook and flip the meat. They also check on you a decent amount so you can get refills on drinks and side dishes. We came right at closing once and our server checked in several times to make sure that we got enough food before the kitchen closed. 

Something that I really like about this place is that they have plenty of options other than meat. They have fresh seasonal vegetables (pineapple, onion, bell pepper, mushroom, &amp; zucchini when I went), marinated veggies, corn cheese, rice cakes, and a vegetarian bibimbap. This way you can go even if you have vegetarians in your group!"

One of the top places I have tried! There is such a large variety of meats that are available. The classic brisket and bulgogi meats were good! They also have cheese and corn cheese on the AYCE menu! The cheese was so good to eat alone or to dip with the meats! It tasted like nacho cheese. I got the marinated squid as well and that was tasty! Not all place can do squid right. I got to try some meats I haven&#39;t seen at other KBBQ places like marinated rib finger! It was one of my groups top choices. They also have a little beer tower, which was nice!

Their $19 2nd to cheapest option also included amazing meat selections, different marinations, steamed egg and yummy cheesy corn.

Will definitely be recommending this spot to others that haven&#39;t found their go to Kbbq spot.

Came here my second time with a group of 10 of us which is definitely a test for customer services, they were spot on. The waiter consistently stopped by to help out, give suggestions. They also switched out grilling pans plenty of times as to not be cooking in burns meat crumbs which was awesome.

The location is large and has plenty of seating, the staff is really nice and we got seated in a section perfect for our large group.

When seated, our tables had water pitchers, but no cups, and we had to ask for the cups instead of them bringing them to us.

The quality is pretty good and it has a very affordable price. Granted it&#39;s quality won&#39;t be like a kang ho dong, but you&#39;re getting what you pay for, and for 20 something, you&#39;re getting some pretty decent meat. On a Friday night around 730, we had about a twenty minute wait for a party of 3. The place was packed, but the service was still good. I guess the only issue with this place is that there is a time limit and each additional time over the 2 hour limit results in an additional charge. 

Overall, the meat is pretty good for an ayce and the price also is pretty good, major downside is the wait time."

This is not one of the best restaurants for AYCE, but for the price its good. I love the beef belly, i&#39;ve never had it before but since there was no option for Beef tongue for this set, this is a good alternative, so highly recommend! I tried all the other stuff that I normally get and I kept getting more beef belly. The waitress was soooo nice and adorable. She was super helpful and honestly.. she has a lot of patience for working at an AYCE which is good and had the nicest service at any AYCE i&#39;ve ever been to. I&#39;m lowkey upset that they make us make our own cheese corn, but its cool, not a big deal. I didn&#39;t like it as much as I normally do just because we mightve cooked it for too long. 

Overall pretty good for the price,  it&#39;s not top quality so come here if you want something cheaper.  What&#39;s good is that they are open later than a few other alternatives, so depending on the time I might be back!"

If you like Korean BBQ you&#39;ll love it here. This place is hidden pretty deep in Korea town. Being Located next two bank is a big positive, there is always parking. 

If you go for dinner, the wait can be anywhere from twenty minutes to two hours. Depending on what day and time of day you go.

So like many other Korean BBQ restaurants it&#39;s all you can eat. There are two different options for food a 17.99 option, and 24.99 option. Both options are amazing. Each option comes with a wide range of different meats(beef, pork, chicken, fish). And it comes with different condiments, and sauces. And there is a large got plate in the middle of the table where you cook the food.

If you&#39;ve never had Korean BBQ then it&#39;s deffently worth a try"

The sides here are plentiful, offering your typical kbbq banchan. Their sauces are standard and im glad they carry sesame oil and salt.

We got the 2nd tier menu just to get shortrib on there, so we tried most of the typical meats on there. The brisket is fine, the shortrib was good, their bulgogi ironically wasnt that good. They serve steamed egg and corn cheese here so thats a plus. 

The place had greasy floors (we were fore warned), and the service was pretty good and quick. All in all a okay kbbq spot but if youre in ktown, spend the extra money and go to another kbbq spot (my recommendation, Road to Seoul)"

Their bulgogi, chicken, steak, &amp; all the sides were really delicious. Huge fan of steamed egg and was quite surprised they put cheese on theirs. I thought it was kind of unnecessary. Our group got the $17.99/person deal for 30 items to choose from! Pretty good price!

They have macaron ice creams for $3.99 that you can purchase for dessert. Looks like they also have a deal going on where if you write a yelp review you get a free macaron ice cream. Mon-Thurs only though - bummer!

Overall we had a good experience. If you love kpop this place is for you because they blast kpop music videos throughout the restaurant. Me, i&#39;m not a huge fan, but it was rather entertaining."

We ended up getting the B option from the Menu. It is 32 items to choose from for only $17.99 per person (such a great option). The one before that is 21 items for $14.99 so I definitely recommend paying the extra bucks and getting more meats.

The service was awesome!! Our waitress was so on top and every time we needed something she would come quickly and get us refills on our banchans. 

Meats are pretty good and can I just say that place is HUGE. There is soooo much seating space it&#39;s ridiculous! I loved it! It doesn&#39;t feel like you&#39;re so close to others. Favorite meats were the black angus beef brisket, marinated flat iron steak, and their bulgogi."

I came here years ago when it was Castle 2 and had super fond memories - prob because it was my second time ever having ayce kbbq and it was only $10 so it just blew my mind. Today its $15 for the cheapest menu and, maybe its because I&#39;ve had some good shit nowadays, that I feel like the quality here wasn&#39;t that great. Granted, I know its only $15 so, you get what you pay for.

Thought the sides were okay. They have really thick radish wraps, which is pretty cool. Sauces on the table are a chili sauce and a savory sauce. You have to ask for the sesame and salt. 

Didn&#39;t like the garlic pork belly...it wasn&#39;t a good cut and also didn&#39;t have that much garlic flavor in the end. Bulgogi was only okay (a bit chewy) for being named bulgogi hut. Brisket was the best thing to order here IMO. No short ribs on the first 2 tiers of the menu at least.

No yogurt drink or anything after your meal, so you&#39;re stuck with a bloated tummy and no digestive assistance *cry*

Getting a table was very easy as it was a Sunday late lunch.  We opted for their C menu, $21.99 /person.  We wanted the steaks and special seafood and let&#39;s just say we broke even easily! The meats were very fresh and the service was excellent!  The grill change happened often enough that it didn&#39;t get too smokey.

Where to start... Service was fine. Our server checked to see if we needed meat on a regular basis. Weird thing is she kept changing our neighbor&#39;s grill, but since our table was a little harder to get to, it would only be changed when we asked. I thought that was very strange. 

CONS: The meat lacked flavor, even the marinated ones. It really didn&#39;t matter if you ordered garlic pork belly or regular pork belly since it tasted exactly the same. Thank goodness for them giving us a pile of salt to help flavor the meat. The beef belly was nicely marbled, but for some reason, just was not good. I love beef belly and theirs was just different tasting that we only had one serving of it as opposed to the several servings we usually get. You get a good number of choices if you pick the top or second tier. I can&#39;t really say which meat I liked the best since they basically all tasted the same... Bland. 

I specifically asked to come here because of their cheese corn. I was so disappointed even if I asked for it twice. The corn was from a can and they just threw some cheese on top. Even when I asked for extra cheese for the second round, the flavor was still lacking. The cheese corn from manna is much better.

There are way too many AYCE Korean bbq&#39;s in k-town. I suggest that you try somewhere else. Hey, if all else fails... BCD is across the street and I do LOVE my BCD on Wilshire!"

I usually recommend all my friends to go here. I go here quite often. I came here after they changed owners and names about a few times in the but the menu selections kept getting better but prices went up of course - current menu goes from $16 - $25 (20 - 42 items). I usually go for Menu A (20 items for $16) depending on what everyone in the group wants. 

***This place allows solo customers before 5pm at regular price which is superb! Most other KBBQ require 2 person minimum, but very few places allow one person and if they do, they charges higher about $20+. I have a passion for AYCE KBBQ and sometimes I can&#39;t find someone to go with me in the spur of the moment - when I found out this place allows one person to eat - I was ecstatic &amp; came here right away***

Service is usually quite good depending on the day and time. All the workers speak English thankfully since many other kbbq it&#39;s difficult to order when they don&#39;t speak English proficiently from what I have experienced.

They have decent banchans (side dishes) - I usually go for the fish cakes, rice paper, mac salad, noodles, &amp; steam rice. 

The meat quality is usually above average. I love to mix the brisket and beef belly together for flavor as well as mixing the dipping sauces: soy sauce and chili sauce. Bulgogi is sweet and flavorful and the garlic pork belly is quite tasty, but sometimes they put too much garlic. I&#39;m a fan of intestines, marinated squid, &amp; corn cheese. Most of the others items on menu A was so and so).

Menu B &amp; C are quite good since they have higher quality meats: marinated rib finger meat, bacon wrapped rice cake, cinnamon sugar pineapple, steamed egg (gotten smaller over the years), sesame marinated beef, butcher cut rib eye steak, sliced beef tongue, marinated jumbo shrimp, &amp; all the short ribs (usually marinated is better in my opinion)"

Who can resist the urge to eat unlimited amounts of meat cooked to your oily perfection while sipping on a nice cold glass of Sapporo.  I&#39;ve been going to KBBQ since I can remember and the first place that I ever went to was Sanyas, but this place definintely blows that place out of the water in terms of meat quality and service.  

Although there was a wait time of 45+ minutes when I got here, the servers for the most part were attentative in calling out names and going through the list as quick as they could.  Parking is free with validation in the lot right next to it, so no trouble there, just do not forget the blue ticket as you walk out!  

Like most KBBQ, you can not go wrong ordering the brisket, and it was flavorful and the meal quality was outstanding.  I am a big fan of the mashed potatoes sides, but unfortunately they did not have that here but no problem!  The various seasoned pork belly here was delicious, such as the red wine and garlic, but towards the end the pork became difficult to go down the stomach.  The bulgogi was straightforward, but the meat was too chewy for my taste.  Maybe I am too simple, but I really enjoyed the brisket here, and it really hit home for me to the point we were thinking about calling this place Brisket Hut instead.

The best part of the night included a $13 pitcher of ice cold Sapporo that was enough for four guys to chow down on some fresh oily meat.  Unlike other KBBQ&#39;&#39;s I have been to in the past, the server we had was very attentative and would always come back to our table for the next round of meat.  There was no need to flag anyone down, and our needs were well met during this night. 

In all, come with an empty stomach and expect to walk out a few pounds heavier.  Expect to fall asleep in the car ride back home due to food coma and buttons possibly flying off your shirts and pants.  I&#39;ll be back soon enough!"

Despite the name and management change, we were looking forward to enjoying our AYCE Korean BBQ meal. 

My cousin, brother, and I parked at the parking lot at the back (free validation for 2 hours during lunch and 4 hours during dinner) and upon entering the place, we were greeted and got seated right away.  The place got really cold whenever somebody opened the door to get in or out since we were closely seated towards the door, but despite the inconvenience it did not stop us from ordering our meat so we can freely cook them.  For the three of us, we each ordered the AYCE for $15, which gave us 21 delicious items to choose and cook.  Some of our meaty favorites included the bulgogi, garlic pork belly, and beef brisket.  However, my most interesting one to cook and taste was the corn cheese.  I highly recommend that one whenever you come to this place!  

As with any Korean BBQ establishment, Bulgogi Hut came with side dishes such as kimchi, salad, and fish cake, which were all decent.  However, I have noticed that all of the side dishes were given as if they were half full.  Also, you have to ask for sesame oil with salt as a dipping sauce because they won&#39;t automatically offer it when you get seated right away. 

Unfortunately, the service was a bit slow during our meal.  When we ran out of some side dishes and meat, we wanted to order another round but had to wait at least 5 minutes to finally get the waiter&#39;s attention and order our food.  At moments like this, I wished we had the button to press on our table so they will know we are ready for the next round right away. 

I found it interesting that in Bulgogi Hut, all of the waiters, waitresses, and hostess are not Korean and can speak English, so for those who want to give KBBQ a try, check Bulgogi Hut out."

Meat are premium and the options -- even for the cheapest package -- is great. Wine pork belly, bulgolgi, brisket, beef belly, hot &amp; spicy squid. They chant my name everyday at dinnertime.. 

And dude, DUDE. Parking is free. In Koreatown, how is that possible? Just get your ticket validated and you won&#39;t have to pay if your stay is under 4 hours during dinner. Honestly worth 5 stars alone for that. The wait is never longer than an hour, usually around 30 mins or less if you come at the right time during dinner.

I&#39;ve been to this place before but it has been about 3 years since then. We were asked to wait until the whole party was there before seated because there cannot be anyone added after wards. We sat a medium sized table for a party of six...It was pretty hot with the stove in the middle..we wished that they could have turned down the AC a little lower lol.

Anyways there were 3 types of meals...a 14.99, 17.99, and 24.99 depending on the amount of choices you want (more expensive = more choices)...we went for the middle ground of 17.99... We ended up ordering 6 plates of meat..pretty weak , in my opinion, considering we were with 4 boys and 2 girls...them boys...tsk..lol...

BH bulgogi
Brisket
garlic pork belly
marinated chicken
marinated flank steak
marinated rib fingerlings(is that what they are called?)

The bulgogi was good, and the pork belly, and the marinated ribs...the others were alright...pretty typical..kinda bland...considering they were supposed to be marinated...but they did have a vinegar dip which def made up for it...let your cooked meats sit in the vinegar and it is bomb!

I was so full but like only 85% satisfied...idk why...

They did have small macaron ice cream yum!!

Bulgolgi Hut is the place to go 
they offer 4 hours of free parking during dinner time - but there&#39;s a 2 hour dining limit 

blasting kpop when you walk in - youre warned by staff to watch the floor because it might be wet - as many times as ive been here i dont understand what causes the floor to be wet 
nonetheless it doesnt stop me from coming back 

upon being seated your table has complementary side dishes, kimchi, hot pickled cucumbers, bean sprouts, glass noodles and seaweed, fish cakes, and macaroni salad - which happens to be a favorite amongst a lot of my friends 

ask for a side of salad and youre served within a timely manner 

menu A give you multiple and basic choices of AYCE for only 15.99$ 
quality meat for the low price is one of the main reasons why i keep coming back to bh 

cant go wrong with getting brisket, bulgolgi, spicy squid, and garlic pork belly 
other items include pork chops, multiple types of squid, multiple types of pork belly, chicken, corn cheese, miso soup, spicy rice cakes, etc. and even a small vegetarian menu - when i came here for my 22nd birthday in may my vegan and vegetarian friends didnt have trouble finding sufficient amount of food to eat off their A menu

highly recommend their pomegranate soju - super good - doesnt even taste like alcohol but pink sweet soda

The food is quite tasty and they give you a wide variety of side dishes. The meat is good quality and they help you portion it out to eliminate food waste. $15.99 per person for AYCE, the cheapest option, was plenty of food for me. Our server, Miyuki, was super sweet, too.

However, I was super turned off by the tacky sales pitch: Write a review for a free macaron ice cream sandwich. Oh but it has to be a 5 star review. WTF?!? That defeats the purpose of Yelp reviews! For someone who takes the act of writing reviews seriously, I am really offended they would resort to such tacky antics to try to raise their Yelp rating. Like Yelp is supposed to be a resource for the undecided consumer to help him or her make a decision about dining options. What&#39;s the point if the reviews are all inflated and don&#39;t reflect customers&#39; true opinions? I get that there is a lot of competition for KBBQ in Ktown. But if you&#39;re worried about the competition, then do better! Improving your daily operations will generate good word of mouth and that&#39;s how you&#39;ll win out - not by deceiving customers!

I would&#39;ve probably given them 4 stars but I am just so disgusted by the tackiness of their promotion.

Our server is super friendly and the meat is really good quality! We did menu a - $15.99 per person for dinner AYCE. I thought it was worth it! You can park at the structure next door and get it validated! We had to wait ~25 minutes on a Thursday night though :("

This place has been through quite a few name changes over the past few years. From Goong to Bulgogi House to Castle 2 to Bulgogi Hut, this place never fails to satisfy my cravings for KBBQ. 

The wait was extremely long for a Monday night, and my table for 2 was seated in 30 minutes. The banchan selection seemed smaller than before, but everything was delicious. 

In terms of meat, there was a good variety that we weren&#39;t able to try all of the choices. I recommend anything beef or chicken. The beef brisket and Bulgogi were tender and so so good. I normally don&#39;t order chicken at KBBQ but I made an exception that night. It was not a mistake! It was seasoned perfectly and cooked well on the grill. A huge miss ended up being the garlic pork belly; they ended up being 2 giant slabs of frozen pork that ended up being very dry and gross. I don&#39;t suggest ordering any of their pork. I also don&#39;t suggest the Miso Soup; it was way too bland. 

My only other gripe with this place was their slow service. It seemed like we had one waiter who was also in charge of 6-7 other tables. We weren&#39;t able to order more food as quickly as we liked. Normally the waiter would be there as soon as we finished a round of food, but this time we had to wait 5-10 minutes to order more. He also forgot our rice a few times. 

Make sure you get your parking validated! It can cost you $10-15 if you park in that lot without validation. 

Overall, the service and some of the food was meh, but it doesn&#39;t stop me from coming back again for more beef and brisket every time I&#39;m in LA!"

We thought it was pretty cool. 

Moving on. We had Lex as our server and he was beyond amazing. Not only did he frequently check up on us and got the food out for us fast, but he is very friendly and we were able to have a few side conversations here and there. He was inviting and created a social environment for my boyfriend and I. We felt welcomed and we hope he did too. Plus, he was wearing a bunny costume and mask and kept his smile on. 

Nonetheless, our first experience was great. If we are ever in the area again, we will be back. Meat selections aren&#39;t too bad. You get what you pay for. Option C ($17.99) is pretty great if it&#39;s for a party of two. My boyfriend and I were stuffed by the end. 

Oh, and the Poison Apple soju? Bomb. 
Would recommend coming here, even just once. Ask for Lex; he&#39;s wonderful."

One of Bulgogi Hut&#39;s main pros is that it&#39;s fairly big so it usually means less of a wait compared to some of the other smaller places. Unfortunately, since Ktown is Ktown, just expect a wait if you come at peak hours (6-8pm). We came here two hours before closing and got seated in 20 min. They validate parking at the structure next to them- but be warned you got to get out of there before midnight or else you&#39;ll pay over 20 bucks to park (same price as a meal for one here)!

The only side at Bulgogi Hut that I&#39;ve always noticed is a big hit with my friends is the macaroni salad. They also started putting rice in a huge communal bowl if you&#39;re a group bigger than four. Additionally, some items have moved around on their menu tiers. We opted for the B menu so we could have more options- sad my beloved beef tongue was another tier higher. :(

Service is on the slower side- could be due to us coming at the end of the night where they don&#39;t really want to rush us. My main issue with Bulgogi Hut is the grill! The grill at some tables can be awful, with only the right side cooking your meat and the left side failing to heat up anything. I would love if Bulgogi Hut could redo the grills or whatever needs to be done."

Menu selection was pretty nice; corn cheese was a pleasant surprise. The brisket was really flavorful and the bulgogi was great as well.

My friend and I came on a Tuesday night and the wait was still about a half hour. The place seemed empty so I guess it was a shortage of staff that caused the wait. The servers were very pleasant and prompt with requests.

Overall a good place to go!"

It feels like you are eating in the middle of big loud party. It is filled with college kids - and the decor is all about graduation - so even someone who is 35 may feel out-numbered (let alone me - who is in my 50s).

There are three large rooms and on my Tuesday night there were well over 125 people (we counted) the entire time we were there, with a line out the door waiting for tables after 10pm when we left.

Large screens everywhere show loud music videos (really loud) which keeps the place hopping with energy. Most places play loud music to get you out - but here - It Works to Keep you there!

So if you want a nice quiet place to eat - this ain&#39;t it!

But if you are young and you like to eat in the middle of a rock-concert - this is the place for you.--  I loved it.

The menu offers three levels of &#34;All You Can Eat&#34; Korean BBQ, cooked at the table (by the server or by you): -

- a $14.99 basic menu (meant for students I&#39;m guessing) - this a big list of items including individually, beef, pork, chicken, and squid, all soaked in the same Bulgogi marinade -- plus the most delicious garlic pork belly --- thin slice brisket --- spicy cuttlefish --- and even some beef stomach and intestines for the true Korean pallets. Along side this is offered Japanese style miso soup (rare at KBBQ), fried gummy noodle logs (good), vegie Bi bim bop (okay), and lettuce with bean paste for wraps. There are a few other items, but no Galbi, or egg custard at this level, or Korean fermented bean/miso with tofu. But for the price - it was fine. 

- one step up is the $17.99 menu, which offers a few more items including beef fingers and pork jowls - and a few more items, plus an egg custard.

- the highest end deal is $21.99 -  which offers everything that they have in the kitchen including rib eye steak, Galbi, beef Bi Bim Bop, and fermented bean soup. However, the choices are almost too numerous (2 full pages of choices), and most of the good stuff, except Galibi, is offered on the cheaper deals. If I got this deal with a group I think that we would spend the entire meal making sure that we only ordered the things that were offered solely on the more expensive menu just to make sure we were getting our money&#39;s worth. That would be too distracting. And we&#39;d end up with a lot of exotic food but not any basic items. So I opt for the cheaper one.

They offer half orders - which I found helpful because we could try more things without leaving leftovers (the Hut charges $9.45 for a substantial amount of left over meat - odd number - 9.45).

The server was attentive and nice but sometimes forgetful of our requests. We had to ask a few times for more than one thing.

Pitchers of beer are a good deal for groups.

They use a lot of the same &#34;sweet-ish&#34; marinade on a lot of their meats.Redundant. 

They have a good kimchee and a few decent Banchan ( on my night it was spicy cucumber, fried fish cake, bean spouts, glass noodles, and the obligatory potato salad) but they only offer those few, plus a tasty salad.

There is 2 hours validated parking in the lot 1 blk south.

Most of all - this place is fun. It is a real celebration of life here - and well worth the 30 bucks for two - even if you feel like a grandpa."

This place have a cheap option for $14.99 with all the kbbq basics like brisket, bulgogi, and pork belly. The amount of banchan they serve is decent, just the right  amount like macaroni, kimchi, cucumbers, fish cake and japchae plus salad. 

What i hate the most when I came here was the service! If i rate them on service alone, I&#39;d give them 1 star. Our seat placement was also horrible...they sat us at the very back corner when there was a bunch of seats at the front. Then our server was always gone and we always have to hunt her down. Service was very slowwwww too...we ask for bibimbap at the beginning but we did not get it until the end when we are finishing our last meat. Plus, the meat tales foreeever to get!! The thing is, our server never juts down our order so i feel like sometimes she forgets. Also, their meat are decent quality but it&#39;s definitely not comparable to other more expensive kbbq places i love. 

There&#39;s alot of good kbbq places out there nowadays, so for me good service is a really big deal to be able to compete with other kbbq restaurants."

Menu A
We ordered:
BH signature bulgogi- standard taste
Black Angus beef brisket - normal it&#39;s usually my fav so I always get this. 
Butcher cut pork steak - not sure I&#39;d order it again was just normal pork
Garlic pork belly - actually tasted some garlic this time
Marinated skinless chicken - takes forever to cook but when you eat it you forget that it took so long
Sliced beef belly - 


Spicy rice cake
Corn cheese - surprisingly good

We usually order Menu A which is $14.99 but you get 21 items. SCORE! Better to come here on an empty stomach because you will be leaving here full. 

Service is quick and friendly. The meats arrive fresh and ready to cook. My favorite is the bulgogi and the beef brisket. Yummy for my tummy! It&#39;s so mouth watering good. Oh and they have a huge selection of sides that they keep refilling it on request. Don&#39;t forget to order the corn cheese. Definitely a must try.

Parking is located in the back and is 2 hours free with validation. Place can get crowded but can&#39;t blame them because of their terrific AYCE deals.

They weren&#39;t stingy with their banchan at all.

...but I have to deduct 1 because I had to remind our server last Sunday (6/12/2016) about 3-4 times about the miso soup, and Cheese Corn that I requested along with the first batch of orders just a few minutes after we sat down. 

Our server and an assistant was attentive in bringing us meat, but our miso soup and cheese corn never came. We did however receive crispy/spicy rice cake that we did not order. 

After we were done eating, the server asked me if we wanted anything else, and I said &#34;my miso soup and cheese corn&#34;. He responded, &#34;Oh! Did you still want those?&#34; I wanted to respond this way so badly, &#34;WELL WHAT DO YOU THINK? THAT&#39;S THE VERY FIRST THING I ORDERED WHEN I SAT DOWN, AND YOU NEVER GAVE IT TO ME. NO SH*T SHERLOCK. OF COURSE I STILL WANT IT.&#34;   but I didn&#39;t. As well mannered as my my parents had taught me to be, I just politely said, &#34;Yes!&#34; with a big smile to sarcastically convey a faux facade of excitement in finally what I&#39;ve been waiting for throughout my entire meal. 

Selection is good even with just the basic $14.99 per person menu, although it&#39;s mostly pork. If you want more beef, you need to order at least one level higher.

I was not thrilled, since I am vegetarian, but figured meat eating hubby would be happier in the hotel room. But I was completely surprised, there were lots of yummy things for both of us. 

We walked in not realizing it was &#34;all you can eat&#34;, so ordering went something like this:
Waitress: What meats would you like sir?
Hub: I&#39;ll take bacon, brisket and tri-tip.
Waitress: Is that it?
Hub: How many choices do I get?
Waitress: As many as you want.
Hub: Honey call me a cab, I&#39;ll be back to the hotel in a few hours.

- The waiters/waitresses are really attentive so I&#39;d like to give a shout-out to their staff. They&#39;re less intimidating than your average AYCE workers, and they&#39;re pretty good with remembering your orders and changing your grill, refilling water, etc. They work really hard, so thank you! 
- Free parking in Koreatown?! Almost a whole star for this. 

And unfortunately, the cons: 
- Bulgogi Hut&#39;s downfall is its management. On more than one occasion they&#39;ve stopped serving garlic or potato salad, two essential side dishes that kind of make or break a meal for me. What&#39;s worse, they started charging some insane price for garlic (like $3) when garlic cloves are dirt cheap (literally, I&#39;m growing my own and bringing them next time). 
- In my most recent visit, we went as a group of 7 people and were seated around a single, round grill. When we asked if we could sit at a table with two grills, or at least with a bigger rectangular grill, we were told that our small table was the &#34;recommended seating for seven people.&#34; 

Now I would normally understand, but it was the middle of the day and the restaurant was half-empty. To add insult to injury, they told us we had a 2-hour maximum as if we could cook more than one plate at a time on that small grill. So just imagine seven (quite hungry) people huddling over a single grill...cue the cornucopia scene from The Hunger Games except over brisket, and awkward lulls while watching our pork belly cook.

Bulgogi Hut--I love you, but I know you can do better."

The waiter was slow and hardly came to the table. 

The bus boy was changing the pan and spilled hot grease on my hand and had the nerve to tell me to be careful. I yelled back and told him to be careful. 

My friend made a complaint to the manager Julian Lee and it was useless. He said he was going to make the bus boy apologize and of course he did not. Not only did my had start to burn he started to get a bubble. The manager seem to not care at all. One thing is for sure they lost mine and my friends business. They did not care that they hurt a customer they did not even apologize. My hand is now marked."

1. Parking: There is, thankfully, free parking behind the restaurant. Make sure to keep the white ticket since you need it to leave. The lot is large so there shouldn&#39;t be any trouble finding a parking space.

2: Wait: Both times I&#39;ve gone, my &#34;party&#34; was only 2 people. Each wait time was only about 20 minutes. 

3. Interior:  I actually really like the layout of the restaurant. It seems really big! Tables are placed next to each other, however it doesn&#39;t feel like you&#39;re eating with the people next to you. There are tvs placed throughout the restaurant that play mostly Kpop, with some American songs here and there. There also seems to be 2 types of grills. The first time I came here I had a rectangular grill, while my most recent trip was a circle grill.

4. Service: AMAZING!!! Both visits the waiters were amazing. They were so nice and patient! No matter how many times we asked for things, they always smiled and never showed frustration/anger/laziness/etc.

5. Price: I&#39;m pretty impressed with the pricing. Both trips we chose the $14.99 meal, which includes 21 options of meats and side dishes.

6. Meat: My favorites are the BH signature bulgogi, sliced beef belly, and the brisket. The sliced beef belly and the brisket are really similar. The brisket is thinner and smaller, while the sliced beef belly is thicker and has more fat. The other meats are really good too! I like the garlic pork belly. I sugggest grilling that before you&#39;re about to change your grill that way the meat you eat after won&#39;t taste like garlic.

Overall, I really enjoy this place. I&#39;m definitely going to make it a must go for my LA visits!"

I had spent the day in downtown LA with a few friends, and later, two of us were looking for a place to eat dinner. We were looking up places on Yelp, and decided on Korean BBQ.  Ultimately, we settled on this place.  I am really glad we did!

We parked in the lot behind the building, although the restaurant address is on Wilshire Blvd, the entrance is on S. Kinglsey Drive.  Take a ticket, they will  validate it for 2 Hrs during lunch &amp; 4 Hrs during dinner.  Good deal!!

Don&#39;t let the name fool you,  it certainly isn&#39;t a HUT, as is indicated in the name!  The interior is really spacious &amp; well laid out as well as WELL-VENTILATED!  The last one being the most important feature!  We barely even smelled like we had eaten at a KBBQ place when we were done!

The waitress was super busy, but she was doing her best to get us everything we wanted!  She had a few tables to wait on and she was doing everything from memory.  Honestly, I don&#39;t know how she does it!  With that being said, yes, we had to ask for things since they didn&#39;t make it to the table.  I&#39;ve had worse service with people using pen &amp; paper!!  

My friend and I opted for the B Menu which includes 32 items for $17.99.  I surprised myself by eating a bit of everything we ordered!  I really enjoyed my dinner &amp; grilling our meats!   All the meats we had were really tender and tasted great!  The dipping sauce was perfect, too!  I must admit, I ate more than I usually do.  We didn&#39;t leave any meats behind!  haha  Since I don&#39;t really know what meats we ordered, I&#39;ll just classify them as meats!  We did get various  cuts of beef and pork.

The only minor issues I had, were with the grill itself &amp; the heat setting.  I was trying to grill my garlic, but I lost a few because they were the right size to fall into the slits of the grill, which happened as I was ready to eat them!  We had a rectangular grill.  When we were seated at our table, our grill was lit, but we didn&#39;t realize that it wasn&#39;t turned up high enough &amp; took a long time to cook our food.  Near the end, we realized we could turn it up ourselves, so my friend took care of that and what a difference that made!!  Since our heat was not very high,our grill didn&#39;t get very &#34;dirty&#34; and we didn&#39;t even get it changed once!

All in all, the experience was great &amp; I hope to make it back soon!  Craving it again!!  If you are in the area, give them a try!!"

The best time to come is around lunch time on a weekday. Service is 100x better, which allows you to eat fast and leave fast.  You come at night, it will be a guaranteed 1 hr wait...too crowded.  Also servers can&#39;t handle the load, so you get neglected more times than you would like.  

I always order brisket,  marinated squid and pork belly.  It&#39;s delicious, consistent and never disappoints. Brisket is not too fatty, squid is pleasantly sweet and savory. There is endless dipping sauce,  which is nice.  Only downside is you have to   for sesame oil and salt if you want it.  The banchan here isn&#39;t really good except for the macaroni salad and the rice sheets.  The rice sheets are a hit or miss,  if you&#39;re lucky they can be soft and yummy.  Or it can be stale and hard."

I&#39;m a regular here, even when they change name/management. Food is awesome &amp; so is their customer service. But last night we had the honor to get served by Hannah. After bringing in meat twice, she didn&#39;t come back at all. She walked past us multiple times without even asking us how we&#39;re doing or if we want anything. I don&#39;t think the management told her to ignore once the guest is seated &amp; ordered something. It&#39;s all you can eat place &amp; it&#39;s not her restaurant that she&#39;d care so much if we&#39;re eating a lot. It&#39;s just she doesn&#39;t care about the customers.

I love this Korean bbq place. Meats are flavorful, not too expensive, big parking lot, usually great customer service. I hope management will at least ask few of the servers there to be more friendly."

We drove past and missed it as it&#39;s pretty nondescript and questioned whether we wanted to eat there, but I hate being pressured to internet search in the car so I decided we should definitely eat here.

I ordered the enchiladas michoacanas with potato and carrots. They did not have cecina, so I went for ranchera. I received a plate with three tortillas dipped in salsa, With crumbs of cheese and chopped potatoes and carrots with un finely chopped cabbage. It was so messy and did not taste like anything.

Our usual weekend spot closes early during the week so we decided to try our luck, to our surprise the food was great &amp; the price was right.

Location: Busy Cesar E Chavez Avenue (formerly Brooklyn) between Breed St &amp; Cornwell St. Right next door the to a nail salon on the corner of Breed St. 

Parking: Street and city public parking lot one block east behind Cesar Chavez businesses.

Environment: Customer areas are clean, main room is colorful, has plastic papel picado banners as well as a a large LCD screen. An annoying juke box turns on every once in a while but has been turned down on occasion. Staff has always been pleasant, the lady cooks are a bit curt but seem like they are doing the brunt of the work so I let them be. lol

Food: Portions are inline wth the price. Everything so far tastes home made. Favorites include:
-Complimentary chips/salsa
-Homemade aguas frescas. The Jamaica is awesome (I request they add half water), my bud loves the horchata.
-Handmade tortillas
-Nopales/cactus on their breakfast (Breakfast menu items $1 extra for lunch or dinner)
-Nopales/cactus burrito (off the menu)
-Chile verde (pork)
-Menudo

WC: Newly renovated, clean &amp; spacious."

Their mole is pretty tasty - not extremely sweet, a hint of spicy and quite rich in flavor. I would recommend it! I just recently visited on a very hot afternoon (3pm-ish) and the interior was pretty pretty &#34;warm&#34;, so be advised (they did have their AC on - or I wish to believe so from the swaying of the decorations - but it didn&#39;t help much)!

Went to lunch with my coworkers and we spent more time waiting and eating greasy stale chips with weak salsa than eating the food we ordered (2 chip baskets and about 20 minutes after until the food came out). 
We ordered a carne asada burrito, a carne asada quesadilla, carne asada gordita and a tinga de pollo quesadilla....sounds simple right? Wrong...took forever to arrive. Poor service, not what we expected (very oily and very dry) and not worth a second chance. Don&#39;t believe me? Bring a bottle of alka seltzer and tums and a snack while you wait.

Parking is availalble on the street, mostly meters so bring enough quarters ($1 per hour).  Cash only establishment.

The restaurant is on the smaller side, at first the place feels very warm when you enter because that is where the kitchen is but as you go toward the seating area on the right, the temperature is acceptable.  This is a very modest place, standard tables and chairs over concrete slab - don&#39;t expect comfy booths and AC.

This is definately a family run business, our menus were handed to us by a beautiful little girl, she looked about 7 years old.  The chips and salsa were standard and soda is by can - no fountain drinks ($1.25).  Our nice waiter appeared to be the son of the cook, he suggested Chile Colorado and Chicken Mole.  Both dishes come with hand made corn tortillas.

Chicken Mole:  My wife is from Mexico and she not only told me but the waiter and his mom/cook that this was the best mole she has ever had!  The mom was very appreciative of my wife&#39;s compliment and they had a long conversation in Spanish.  In a nutshell, everything is made there from scratch and it included bananas in the recipe and some other ingredients that went above my head.  I did try the mole sauce and it was very good, lots of flavor but the chicken meat itself was standard.  We were told that the same sauce is used in their enchiladas, I would suggest this over chicken if calories is not your concern.

Chile Colorado: This was my plate and it was excellent!  The quality is in the sauce, deep rich red color and they hit this one right on as well.  The beef itself appears to be chuck steak, tender enough but as you can expect, you get chunks of fat every once in a while but hey, it&#39;s beef!  The pototoes that comes with the dish in the sauce was also good, not too overcooked but overall it was a bit on the salty side.  I would order this again.

Corn tortillas:  I love this place just for the tortillas!  They also ask if you want more, I consider this very generous since most places limit the servings of hand made corn tortillas , just make sure you have enough water or soda to wash it down because I nearly choked as my throat went dry and had to grab my wife&#39;s drink.  I&#39;m tortilla feind and with no manners, I know.

My son ordered a plain carne asada taco with rice and beans - he has not developed his palate yet for some other other interesting Mexican food dishes.  The taco is a good size and they use the same hand made corn tortilla.

Their rice and refried beans are okay but they appear to have some kind of meat in the beans, I&#39;m not sure why they did that since I find it unecessary, perhaps this is a Mexican regional cooking style, I did not care enought to ask or make an issue out of it.  

The service at this restaurant is friendly and cordial, since there is only the one waiter he can get ovewhelmed when it gets busy so you have to waive him down if you need anything.  So why not a 5-star rating?  The food is very good and place is humble, the places that get 5-stars in my rating system are those that provide all around food quality, value, service, convenience, and atmosphere; this place is not in that league but acceptable as long as you adjust your expectations for a new dining experience.  

We would definately come back to this restaurant and reccomend the mole sauce to our friends and family."

The homemade tortillas totally made this place for me along with the spicy slighty smoky salsa.  I had their chicaronnes quesadilla (couldn&#39;t decide between that and the tikka spicy chicken tostada) and it was such an interesting textural experience - the chicaronnes were soft and gelatinous swimming in sauce inside a very soft fluffy and hearty homemade tortilla, a little melted cheese inside, alot of chopped lettuce and small dollop of sour crema and sprinkled crumbly cheese ontop and served piping hot.  Very simply presented but interesting and even tho I only ordered ala carte, my portion size was filling.  If you&#39;re really hungry, get their lunch plates.

My boss let me try some of her mole which came out thick and rich and dark chocolatey atop chicken and served with rice, beans, and screaming hot homemade tortillas.  The mole had a nice rich flavor to it and I imagine must be wonderful to eat on a cold or rainy day.

Parking is difficult because there&#39;s no lot - all street parking, but I think making a trek out to La Chispas De Oro is worth it.   The sign is tiny and you might miss it, but if you&#39;re near Chicago Street on Cesar Chavez, you&#39;re close by.  The restaurant is located next to a corner nail salon at the intersection of (Cornworth? Cornwallis?) and Cesar Chavez."

I love their: 
-caldo de pollo (cilantro, onion and lemons to make your own mix, like Mexican pho. served with rice and tortillas made in house) 

-the chiles rellenos (I ask them to put their mole on the chile relleno instead of the usual sauce, its a good chocolate based mole so with the egg, chile and chesse, wow)

-the pozole is very good on the weekends.

-the chilaquiles are good, not great. 

-chorizo plates are good (with egg, with papas, with eggs and papas mixed, nopales,.. ask them and know how to explain and they will do it. Be nice)

-the table salsa has a good kick (no gentrified non picoso chile here, baby)

The staff is very nice. Been coming here for years. 

One morning a group of WW2 veteranos came in and sat at table next to me. They were telling war stories in Calo (spanglish littered by pochismos). I remember one story by a man who had half an index finger. He said, &#34;We were all in the belly of a boat. I was up towards the back and could see pura Raza all the way as far as I could see. When they opened up the door, we were the first ones to hit the beach.&#34; A silence between them and nods of heads.

If you&#39;re not familiar with sulungtang, it&#39;s a beef broth soup. Be sure to add salt or it will taste plain.

It did taste delicious and we felt satisfied and happy....but then.... we got home and my belly became severely bloated and painful. For the rest of the night, I was writhing in pain trying to get rid of the knot in my belly. The next day, my friend also reported a lot of pain in her stomach. 

That little white seasoning was probably MSG. My friend did not put any white seasoning into her stew, but also had stomach pain! It tells me that their stews weren&#39;t natural and likely flavored with artificial chemicals.

There is a small private lot in the back that&#39;s free, but it looked like they also had some valet parking halfway into the lot. It&#39;s located on the corner, and it&#39;s 24/7!

Upon entering we were seated right next to the A/C so that was great. There&#39;s a few TVs inside playing Korean shows to keep guests entertained. The service was pretty prompt and served us pretty quickly, though it wasn&#39;t particularly busy for a Saturday afternoon. She handed us the paper mat menus, and came back promptly to take our orders.

I opted for the Special which included all things like flank and intestines. I forget how much I don&#39;t really like intestines at Korean places, they don&#39;t always clean the insides. It&#39;s cooked, but it gets that grainy texture which I am not terribly fond of. Other than that the soup was perfect for the hangover, so milky and rich. I kind of wish the bowls were a little bit bigger in quantity like east of Los Angeles, but it&#39;s alright. It was still quite good for the price/area.

I&#39;ll keep this place in mind next time I need a 24/7 joint for soup."

We got here at 3AM and I&#39;m so happy this place is opened 24 hours because they truly deserve it. They have a parking lot in the back too so that helps from a drunk night or a long one too. 

I got a soybean tofu soup and their seafood pancake, which was amazing with the soup was flavorful in spices and soft and not too salty, enough for my rice on the side. The rice on the side also comes in a stonepot as well! 

The seafood pancake was perfectly cooked and crispy, and their dipping sauce had plenty of flavor! But the seafood pancake did lack seafood. *check in on yelp, you can get a free soda or seafood pancake, the lady said the seafood pancake is only for dinner but she was sweet enough to ask the chef if he can still make it for us and he did! thank you.*

My friends got the spicy tofu soup and a mixed bibimbap. They&#39;re actually pretty picky on what they like to eat too so surprisngly they said they will be back. 

Can&#39;t wait to come back to Ktown *hearts forever*"

Open 24 hours and the selection is huge! The seafood pancake is pretty bomb--looks like a deep dish pizza and is crunchy on outside, soft and fluffy on inside. It could use a bit more seafood in my opinion, but definitely delicious! Kalbi tang is also pretty tasty and light, which is great if you want just a little something for food. The bf and I are complete piggies though and couldn&#39;t help but order more....Squid and pork bokkeum (stir fry?) is really good as well, though you must mix it with the purple rice or the flavor may be a bit overwhelming. Do note this dish is also pretty darn oily. The last thing would be the bibim cold noodles, which for me was a miss. The cold noodles got un-chewy pretty quickly, which was a big bummer for me, as I like traditional extra chewy noodles, but it was cheap?

Don&#39;t expect a whole lot banchan-wise, I think you only get two or three sides...the radish is way too salty, but I do like the kimchi a lot!

Anyway, I want to come back and try the bossam, along with all the other goodies. The employees there are quite nice, though they refused to believe that I speak Korean and kept talking to me in English (I guess I don&#39;t look very Korean, afterall). One of my current fave spots in Ktown for accessibility (free parking in the back yaaaaas), availability, quantity, AND quality! Great balance...be back soon!"

I went with the Galbi Tang.  It came with few side dishes and rice in a stone bowl - which was added plus.  

The soup was over flavored with Beef Flavoring and some of the galbi meat was hard to chew.  Galbi in the soup should been soft and easily fall of the bone using a chopsticks; one should NOT have to fight to enjoy the soup.

One good thing about this place, it&#39;s open 24 hours.... but unless they cook the galbi longer, it&#39;s not worth getting the Galbi Kuk... maybe it only happened on the day I visited... but first visit left me with bad taste... probably will not be back since there are other kuk (soup) places in the area."

The restaurant specializes in soups, so definitely stick to the soupy things.  Those who ordered non-soupy things were overall less satisfied with their food and didn&#39;t finish.  I&#39;ve only had variations of the gamjatang (kimchi vs. regular) here.  While I&#39;ve been satisfied with both, I much preferred the non-kimchi version, as the preponderance of pickled veggies added bitterness to the soup.  Nonetheless, I appreciate the amount of pork that comes in each bowl, though sometimes the pieces are more bony than meaty.  My friends ordered the sulungtang, and were moderately satisfied with their food.  That being said, I think you can probably find better gamjatang and sulungtang at more specialized restaurants in the area.  The banchan here is limited; I believe you only get two types of kimchi (radish and cabbage) but is fairly decent.

Service here can be decent, but the lone waitress at night was clearly overworked and underpaid. She barked at some of us for not speaking Korean, even as others tried to explain to her that we weren&#39;t all ethnically Korean.  And, she grabbed the chopstick/spoon box from us when we were trying to distribute them amongst our group.  (When I&#39;ve come during regular dinner hours, the staff has been very accommodating, so I&#39;m assuming this is a byproduct of Keungama being open 24 hours a day / 365 days.)  I&#39;m also thankful that the restaurant had a security guard at night since there was a random weirdo who was taunting diners with terrible dance moves outside the front window.  For the record, he fled when the security guard approached him.  This was just a very bizarre night...

The interior of the restaurant is pretty standard for restaurants in K-Town; plain, but functional.  Valet parking is available in the lot behind the restaurant, but I&#39;d recommend circling the neighborhood for free street parking.  Metered parking is available on the street in front of the restaurant.

I&#39;d recommend Keungama if you&#39;re looking for something convenient and filling after a night of singing at Rosen, especially if you&#39;ve already paid for valet parking..  Otherwise, it&#39;s probably not worth seeking out Keungama solely for their food."

The restaurant is decently sized and there were around maybe 10 other customers dining in. But I was sat in the separate &#34;room area&#34; of the restaurant from everyone else. My guess is because I wasn&#39;t Korean. 

And because I was basically hidden from everyone else, it was hard to flag down any of the waitresses. It took 15 minutes for one of the waitresses to finally give me my water and menu. And another 15-20 minutes for them to take my order. Customers (who were Koreans) who came in after me got faster service and got their food before me. And even when I did receive my food, they did not check up on me once. It was like they were trying to avoid my gaze. Maybe it&#39;s because they couldn&#39;t speak English and didn&#39;t want to deal with me. I had ordered a beef soup based dish and it was delicious.

Atmosphere: wide open with plenty of seating. TVs. Self help utensils. 

Service: The night we went it was not busy at all. We were the only ones in the restaurant. 24/7. Accepts credit cards.

Food: It was the first time I experienced for myself what fake soup tasted like. I ordered the sullungtang which had very thin soup with the color of a long stewed broth. I have heard rumors of some restaurants adding creamer to their soups but this is the first time I&#39;ve suspected this happening. Sad. The kimchee was good but too sweet, they must have added a lot of sugar.

Intangibles: go elsewhere for sullungtang, unless you want some coffee with your cream. ;)"

I&#39;ve been here so many times, that has been satisfying.  I always bring my new friends here because they&#39;re open 24 hours.
My favorite part of the meal is gamjatang, the pork neck, potatoes, perilla seeds, perilla leaves with spicy broth. The meat is super tender and absolutely delicious. 
I also tried galbitang and spicy galbi jim (steamed beef short ribs).
Both were very good and rich with deep in flave.  You do not disappoint!! 
We got our rice in dolsot, which is a Korean stone pot that makes the rice crispier with multi grain rice. Its way better than regular rice bowl so I recommended its worth. 
The service was also excellent. Servers, great Korean aunties worked quickly and very attentive even though it was quite busy. 
Definitely a recommend and love this place!!"

This is so cool. If you&#39;ve had a long day at work and haven&#39;t gotten a chance to eat dinner and it&#39;s 11 at night - this place is open! If you&#39;re jetlagged and are still awake at 330 in the morning and you&#39;re hungry - this place is open! If you&#39;re...ok, you get the idea. 

This place has got all kinds of Korean soups on the menu, including my favorite, galbi tang!!! They also have sul-lung tang, gom tang, gamja tang, budae jjigae, all kinds of yummy korean food. And instead of a whole bunch of banchan, you get cabbage kimchi and radish kimchi, which is all you need while slurping delicious hot soup. 

The soups come with rice in the stone pots, so you can have the burnt rice at the bottom later. The food is good here and I am just astonished that this place is open 24 hours."

I walked in on a Friday night with my Korean friend who suggested the place and other than a table of 3 Chinese girl, we were the youngest people in the room. I would go to say that at least 70% of the patrons are currently receiving social security checks and the rest are mostly getting there. To top it off, a Korean funeral party came in a little after we sat down and took up over half of the restaurant. They were all eating and watching the Dodgers game but the atmosphere was still fairly grim.

Keungama is known for their soups and stews. If you walk through the back area to the parking lot or the bathroom, you can see the humongous vats that they cook the soups in. Most people either order the Gamjatang, kalbitang, selleongtang, or the jungol.

My friend and I ended up ordering a combo for 2 that&#39;s written in Korean. It&#39;s actually an amazing deal at $26.99. For that price, we get a big plate of Bossam (lettuce wrap with pork belly and radish kimchi), Gamjatang (spicy pork bone and potato stew), one hot stone rice per person and your choice of either a bottle of soju or makgeolli.

The bossam was pretty good but I didn&#39;t like that the pork belly had cartilage left in. It was a pain to pick it out but I guess some people enjoy chewing on the cartilage so they just eat it like that. The soup was also very disappointing. The flavor wasn&#39;t very strong and I didn&#39;t think that it was spicy enough. The meat was tender but most of the pot is mostly the neck bone.

The service is fairly good. They have a call button, which I love. They also have many large flat screen showing the game."

The meat is so soft--it just falls off. The only one complaint about eating this is that the bowl that they serve the food on is too small to fit all the massive bones from the meat so it gets a little hard to stick your spoon in for the soup. Ya know what I mean?

We also ordered the bulgogi. The bulgogi was not good at all. There was a strong taste to it that almost tasted like alcohol. I have a feeling this was just a bad thing to order because this place is known more for their soups. 

Service is pretty good for a Korean restaurant and the restaurant is very spacious. One thing that wasn&#39;t good about this place though is they didn&#39;t have a variety of ban-chan like most Korean restaurants but the kkakddogee was money. They have valet parking in the back.

The quality is the lowest of all food I ever tasted in K-town. The beef stock in the soup lacked a deep note, which you can taste in any cheap restaurant if you actually go to Korea. The meat is the kind of meat that should not be put into the soup. It was the wrong kind and had the flavor of McDonald&#39;s sausage muffin. The rice was dry and burned. I think the rice was prepared hours ago and only heated up before it got served.

Was feeling a bit blue last week and body just gave up. To soothe the cold, I was crazy for something warm and soul nurturing. Since I already had plans for dinner, my friend and I ditched our sushi idea out the window and went searching through my bookmarked list on yelp for &#34;korean soup&#34;

Well, we were in ktown and Keungama popped up.

First impressions:
-Typically ktown restaurant, nothing super fancy, huge dinning room, lots of space.
-Loved that they had the metal utensils here.
-menu laid in front of you and is EXTENSIVE! so many SOUP options.

If you&#39;re a big soup lover, then this is the place for you. All the portions are pretty huge and good to share too.

Personally, to help me recover I ordered the chicken ginseng soup. Here, I would say that the broth is less flavorful than at some other joints that I&#39;ve tried. Personally it doesn&#39;t bother me too much.. although I wish the ginseng flavor stood out a bit more. It was a little too subtle for my taste.

My friend order the Gamjatang and that was delicious. The personal portion was even a bit too much for him to finish. And although he&#39;s not normally a big soup/broth kinda guy, he really enjoyed the dish.

They serve everything with the purple rice here. yum!

So final thoughts?

-you can&#39;t go wrong with the Gamjatang as everyone suggest
-service can be a bit on the slower side since there&#39;s only one waitress :(
-prices are reasonable
-probably would only come back for cheap late night eats."

After having ox tail soup at several restaurants, I finally realized this was the place and it was actually galbi tang and not goligom? (Ox tail) tang. Hehe 

The galbi tang is perfect. So far, any sul lung tang that I&#39;ve tried outside of han bat had been super meh. Needless to say, do not betray han bat if you want SLT or you will regret it.

After trying bossam at soon dae, I was on a hunt for cheap bossam. I to-goed my first order at keugama and arrived at home only to realize it was the beef version and not PHAT belly. I just wanted to kick and scream and roll around on the floor. So second time I sat down at this place and properly ordered the correct dish. Welp, I wanted cheap bossam so I got cheap bossam. Even the beef version was better than the pork belly. The pork belly simply isn&#39;t phat enough. It doesnt have flavor like the soon dae one does so they give you the salty shrimp sauce to help the blandess. It&#39;s not bad but it&#39;s also not satisfying so what&#39;s the point..

I think kamja tang here was pretty good too. But I would only come to this place for galbi tang!

PROS: 
- Open 24 Hours 
- Accepts Credit Card 
- Restaurant is big and clean, and they have a big parking lot in the back 
- Great tasting soups 

CONS: 
- They only give you 2 side dishes: Kimchi and Radish 
- Waitress seem to be very forgetful. You have to ask them several times to get something (Perhaps it&#39;s because we were sitting at the corner of the store?) 
- Soup is expensive ($11.50 for a soup?) 

There was a long list of soups available on the left side of the menu. I had a hard time debating if I wanted Sul Lung Tang, The Ginseng Chicken Soup, The Ox Tail Soup, or other available soups. My friend highly recommended their KIMCHI GAMJATANG and said that&#39;s the best thing they serve here. Since he&#39;s Korean and know his Korean food, I trusted him and ordered the KIMCHI GAMJATANG also. 

KIMCHI GAMJATANG (also known as the &#34;Kimchi Potato Soup&#34;) was served with aged kimchi, lots of pork neck bones (with meat if you are lucky) and potato. Soup was served bubbling hot, and initially I was worried that it might be too spicy for me, but the flavors was just perfect for my taste buds and I licked every drop out of the stone pot after the pot cooled. They also give you a big serving of purple rice. 

Even though the service was mediocre and price is a little on the high end for &#34;soup&#34;, I think this place is definitely worth coming back to."

Honestly, I have tried  other and better tasting sullungtangs elsewhere. Ive tried theirs and it was very weird in taste. I dont know how to explain it but it was just weird and I was not used to that flavor. I cant say its not good because its not about whether it tastes good or not. I dont know. It just tastes different.

I also tried this one dish, intestine stew. That was pretty good and fulfilling for a hearty meal. However, I was informed that they no longer have that on their menu.

I always place an order by phone for pickup and whoever answers my calls, they are ALL SUPER NICE. Very kind and patient. I really like their customer service.

For banchan, they are pretty stingy. They gave cubed daikon in spicy sauce, and some uncut, homemade kimchi. They provide a scissor and tongs at every table, so you cut the kimchi yourself. 

If you order the soup, they provide purple rice in a stone pot, complimentary. The ginseng chicken was a tad overcooked (first time, it was just right, and meat was so tender). The sullongtang was ok. Portions were fair.

Their mung bean pancake is good, but $8? Seriously? 

It&#39;s a decent Korean soup place, and I&#39;ll go if I&#39;m in the area.

They take credit cards, even though there&#39;s no sign."

You know you can expect great food when the kimchi and other side dishes are good. I was extremely satisfied with the spicy kalbi jjim and the sulungtang was pretty good as well.

I came here with some acquaintances for dinner and ordered their spicy pork and potato soup ($10.99). The portion is huge! I ended up packing the remainder and enjoying it again for lunch the next day, so totally worth the cost. This order comes with a serving of rice (not enough if you&#39;re sharing).  I can&#39;t remember if you can specify the level of spiciness for your soup but mine was just right; just enough to clear my sinuses. Ahhhh. The pork was soooo tender, you can tell they&#39;ve been stewing it for a while. Absolutely delicious. 

Parking may be a little difficult since it&#39;s street parking but there&#39;s also the option of valet as well. 

Take my opinion with a grain of salt though because I&#39;m a noob to Korean food. I would definitely recommend the spicy pork and potato soup to fellow newbies."

The city is arguably a poster-child for gentrification&#39;s Jeckyl and Hyde, but one thing remains a constant through the tug-of-war of the two-sided struggle:  food.  

Keungama is comfort food to the area as Krystal&#39;s is to the South.  Open 24 hours a day, a Hamilton brings you side dishes and soup reminiscent of a wayfarer&#39;s meal found by traversing the old Korean countryside.  One that is uncovered in a small tavern owned by a modest family of three making ends meet with great home-cooking.  A smorgasbord of pickled cabbage and radish accompany your meal as an eager accompaniment to your dish of choice.

I recommend the spicy Kalbi Chim.  It boasts of fatty, slow-cooked beefy and spicy goodness, garnished with shreds of the egg, noticeably standing out among the fiery red and outgoing guests as a modest garnish, likened to the shy, but lovable, wallflower at your high-school prom.  He adds nothing to the party, yet completeness is absent without him.  A large amount of meat hangs eagerly fork tender on the bone in fervent anticipation in marrying your rice.  This daughter does not require a shotgun wedding because everybody here is in love.

I feel sick trying to attempt an Anthony Bourdain-type review.  Did I do ok?  This place is good and 24 hours a day.  That&#39;s all I have to say, all day err-day."

It surprised me to find that it is located in the same building complex as Cafe Village (a favorite I should write a yelp review for soon)! Parking was easy, no valet around 3-4 pm. 

We went in through the back entrance, saw a bunch of cooking bowls (they were so humungo and made the place seem legit..hence, I expected a lot), greeted by some friendly ahjumas (Korean for Older Ladies), and served right away. 

Of the many options on their soup based menu, we ended up ordering a $6.99 kimchee jigae (kimchee stew) and their $5.99 meat sullungtang (none of us were brave enough to try the &#34;gut&#34; or &#34;mixed&#34;). It was a little bland even when adding half a spoonful of salt. I like mixing in kimchee when eating sullungtang so it was pretty exciting when tasting the kimchee made my mouth water.  The salted shrimp was a good addition for my meat. And they have chopped green onions to add for flavor as well. 

The rice comes in hot rock made bowl, allowing the rice pieces to harden, allowing for one to add hot water at the end to enjoy a refreshing round of what we like to call &#34;nooroong jee&#34; (hardened rice with hot water, sort of like a tea?)

Overall, the service was friendly (the lady at the counter especially had a smile that was super contagious), the place was clean (except the restroom area), and parking was easy. I&#39;ve had better sullungtang but the rice sort of made up for it. In the end, it&#39;s a restaurant worth going back to.

Oh and for those late night-ers. This place is also 24 hours!"

I&#39;ve been coming here with my parents and family for the last 5-8 years.  If you want flavorful sulungtang (beef broth with beef slices and guts) and their delicious rice in a stone pot this is the place to go.

My mom mentioned this place to me the other night and with this sudden cold weather in Southern California I couldn&#39;t help but crave a nice hot bowl of sulungtang.  It was really crowded when we got there because it was lunch time and I think everyone in k-town was pretty much on the same page as me about eating hot soup.  We were basically self-seated towards the back which unfortunately also contributed to lack of waiter service (another reason for 4 stars instead of 5).  

The waitress brought us the kaktugee (pickled radish kimchi) and kimchi in the stone pots-yum! The idea is to use the scissors given in the metal tin on the table to cut the kimchis so they&#39;re bite size instead of enormous chunks.  

I have to say I was a little disappointed because my sulungtang (mixed) wasn&#39;t as hot as I wanted it to be- slightly lukewarm.  I was going to send it back to get it heated more but I was too hungry and it would&#39;ve probably taken forever for them to get it back to me since there were only 2 servers for the entire restaurant. But I was glad that they were generous with the meats and guts (I love dipping it in the soy sauce with wasabi)- at least they&#39;re more generous than they are in Korea where they barely give any meat. 

Anyways, I love the purple rice in the stone pot, it tastes amazing and it is one of the main reasons I come here.  At the end of the meal they bring hot barley tea and pour it into the rice pot with the remaining layer of rice that&#39;s crispy and you eat the it with the remaining kimchi. So delish! This is apparently my mom&#39;s favorite part of the meal because she ate mine, my sister&#39;s and hers!

My mom also ordered kamjatang which is a pork and potato soup that is slightly spicy.  The broth for her soup was delicious but for some reason i didn&#39;t really enjoy the pork as much- it wasn&#39;t very tender and the flavor was a little off.  I mean I guess I shouldn&#39;t expect much because they really specialize in beef soups here not pork.  There are other restaurants in k-town that specialize in kamjatang and they are amazing. 

Overall, I enjoy coming here to grab a delicious bowl of sulungtang- so filling and tasty.  The price is pretty great as well too, my soup was only $6.50 or so and with tax it comes out to about $7 or so!  Also on your way out the exit in the back, you can watch through the glass the huge cauldrons of soup being made (it takes several hours for the broth to be made). My sister and I just stood there and watched the men stirring the meat into the water...awesome."

IMHO, the best thing here is the bi-mool naengmyun special, best for those who are wishywashy, indecisive...  like me.

They give you a bowl with 2 parts.  One is for the mool (beef broth) naengmyun and the other is for the bibim (spicy) naengmyun..

There&#39;s definitely better naengmyun in this world but for $6 this can hold it&#39;s own.

Perfect for the crazy hot days lately!"

Well, that is all I had left..bones. The Kalbi tang was perfect. I sucked the meat off right down to the bone. It was not a hard task. The meat was as tender as imaginable and fell right off the bone. Meat? Yup, lots of it!  While I was disappointed that only two banchan items were provided, I was impressed with the quality and taste of the broth. The abundance of meat and quality of the broth have me loving this soup.

Also on the menu...Oxtail soup! That will be a very special moment when I try that.. Just can&#39;t wait.

A place dedicated to soup..yummy soup.  By trick, scheme, and device, I was able to get my coworkers to come here..all of whom loved it. 

~Parking
It was easy at the time, but can be difficult. There is meter parking in front. There is also a plaza on the next block that does valet. You can probably just drop by one of those stores. It&#39;s free for two hours.

Anyways, I go on to the Yelp app and see pictures of huge burgers and marvelous looking food. We were sold and ended up here. It was on a weekday so I wasn&#39;t expecting it to be too busy. Not in the greatest area, in fact it got to a point where we were uncomfortable to walk to the bar from our car. Luckily, there was a parking lot for us to park so we felt a little safer. 

The atmosphere of the place was chill, had live music playing that night. However the service was not that great. I am not expecting a hug at the door, but some type of acknowledgement &amp; sense of urgency would be nice. Needless to say, I was disappointed in the slow service. 

I remember the burger being okay, it did not strike me as a superb burger at all... Very greasy but it balanced out with the alcohol. The fries were tasty though, thicker cut than usual fries.

Fried pickles - as an appetizer we had their fried pickles. I would not recommend these because they were not that tasty. Overly battered pickle where it was all bread no pickle. Came with a sweet dipping sauce. I actually would remove one side of the breeding to be able to taste the pickle. 

The Godzilla - 6oz NY strip steak, provolone, grilled onions, and mushrooms. I have to say this sandwich was very good. Meat cooked perfectly with some pink and very tender. The fries were very good. Nice and seasoned, crunchy and hot. Who doesn&#39;t like hot fries. 

Build Your Own Burger - Includes any three ingredients listed on our burger menu. Additional items have an additional charge. My wife enjoyed building her burger and thought it was. Rey good and cooked perfectly.

In terms of service, the bartenders were fast and on point but they only had 1 server for the entire bar. She tried her best but they really needed more servers on the floor. 

The food itself was very good for bar food. We had fried pickles which from other reviews I was expecting to be overly breaded but they were perfect. We also had French fries and wings.

What I don&#39;t come here for is confrontation. The manager and another employee are sitting at the table next to us and obviously trying to call the guy/get his attention/satiate him.

What kind of manager lets drunk patrons yell at a table of people minding their own business, then sits next to them silent? Super fail on her part.

My only complaint is that they market themselves as a Chicago sports bar but the TV&#39;s are not very big and they could use a few more of them. At least one big tv in the center of the bar or something.This place gets really crowded during Chicago playoffs events but it&#39;s sometimes tough to see the TV when it&#39;s so deep with patrons.

The Captain Kangaroo Burger is where it&#39;s at.  

6 oz beef patty - medium plus
Fried Egg
I subbed the Canadian Bacon for regular Bacon...because DUH
Hashbrown Patty
Cheddar Cheese
Gravy
Cholula

On a super soft bun.  

And since you are what you eat, apparently I was a BEAST that night.  A mini beast, cause while it sounds massive, it all fits beautifully on a not-so-large bun.  It was perfect.  The beef was flavored well and all the flavors went deliciously well together.  It came with either a side salad or fries... and since I was going big that night, i went with fries.  They were just okay... they could have been cooked a little crispier, but you could tell they were fresh cut.  

We also shared the buffalo mushrooms... it was a bit over drenched in buffalo sauce, but we still inhaled them nicely.  It comes with a side of either blue cheese or ranch dressing.  We chose the latter and it was quite tasty!  

And while I live on and love the Westside, I dislike Westside whiskey prices.  So when they say they have your favorite whiskey, Red Breast, for $10.09 (yes, $10.09), you say, &#34;yes, please, I&#39;ll have 2 on ice, thank you.&#34;  

Service was on point all night even though we started out as a two-some and slowly grew into a 10+-some and even ended up moving tables.  They were able to divvy up bills and didn&#39;t even screw it up.  

I can&#39;t wait to go back.

My coworker and I decided to come here for lunch so it was quiet with very few people.  I liked it because we were seated quickly and our orders were taken right away.  

While I was waiting for our food to come out, I noticed my surroundings and there&#39;s really a lot to look at.  Flags from all around the world hang from the ceilings above the bar to represent all the different teams. I like this so that people who want to watch their team will feel welcome to watch there.  I think a soccer game was on when we went. 

The location of this place can easily be missed and I think they have a parking lot in the back area, too, but I ended finding street parking right in front. 

Food was amazing! Got the Kangaroo burger with chili fries.  So tasty~  The only thing is I had a simple request not to add the hot sauce, however, they still added it :(   I didn&#39;t die, and I dealt with it.  

Price-wise, it&#39;s worth it. A bit pricey, but not food is so good and they have a whole bunch of beers to choose from that goes great with a good burger!

I&#39;ll try a different burger next time I come! One that already comes without hot sauce :P"

We got the mushrooms, grilled cheese and Mac and cheese to share. 
Let me tell you, everything was so good. The Mac and cheese had bacon in it and every bite I sure got a piece of bacon, grilled cheese had a small tomato soup to dip and their tomato soup was so amazing, grilled cheese was made perfect. And the mushrooms, they were battered and tossed in buffalo sauce. I could eat that al the time. I would choose that over boneless wings any day.

Totally decked out in Christmas decor and lights. Service was great, had a really cute brunette bar tender I think her name was Hilary. 

They have happy hour til 8pm! $5 craft beers, wells, house wine. Ask which beers are on HH! The higher alcohol content ones usually are NOT. 

They also have specials throughout the week... We happened to go on whiskey Wednesday. Starting at 9, some whiskeys such as Jameson, bulleit, jack, buffalo trace and others are $5!!! 

Cousin got a cucumber mint cocktail which was refreshing. We also ordered cheese fries with gravy on the side. The cheese was ooey gooey mozzarella and the gravy was thick and savory. Would definitely try more food items next time.

we brought two dogs and sat on their enclosed patio which has 2 TVs and a decent view of the LA skyline. They also have board games, your party can check out one at a time. Jenga, apples to apples... Etc.

Would love to come back again anytime to listen to their live music with the pups!! Dog loving alcoholics rejoice :)"

Get there early for a table. Service is great-- attentive and not pushy. We were there one Sunday night with a revolving group of friends-- and bills. No complaints at all...Not very one ordered either!

This bar is a little rough around the edges: the bands play hard and loud Americana punk, the drinks are simple and cheap and the food is greasy and sticks to your ribs.  However, the staff and patrons are surprisingly super caring and friendly.

While my friend and I were watching the band perform, a guy fell on me (yes, he LITERALLY fell on top of me!) and ripped my diamond earring stud off my ear. I pulled out my cell phone flashlight and started looking around for the missing earring. At least 4-5 other people stopped what they were doing to look around too, but we couldn&#39;t find it. 

I asked the bartender if I could leave my contact info in case they found my earring the next day. She was suuuppppper nice and really went above and beyond to help me. She gave me her name and told me to call the next day to see if they found it. She was empathetic and reassured me their clean up staff was very thorough and honest. She even went and helped me search for the earring too.  I was really blown away by how helpful everyone was about it considering how drunk they all seemed. Unfortunately we didn&#39;t find the earring and I was really sad because there was a lot of sentimental value in those earrings.

Fast forward to me arriving home at the end of the night. I walk over to the bathroom and look at myself in the mirror hoping to see if by freak chance my earring was stuck onto the fabric of my dress...and it WAS!! My earring stud fell off my ear and somehow got caught between the layers of my dress and managed to stay there the whole night!!

So I&#39;m writing this review to (1) rave about how awesome this place is and (2) let Victoria the bartender know that I found my earring and thanks for being so sweet!!"

Outdoor seating, but expect to wait, you got to go inside sometimes to get a waitress to come to you, even when it&#39;s not busy. I sometimes just order at the bar for this reason and eat outside. Slow service.

I decided to take her to the border line of Skid Row and Little Tokyo known as Skidrokio.  To find this restaurant called  Escondite it is well hidden in Skidrokyo.   When I saw the episode of Man find food Adam Richman went the Escondite and saw a off the menu item that&#39;s never shown on the menu it&#39;s true. 

The off the menu is called Godzilla destroy Skidrokyo that&#39;s the sandwich my wife and I will share to conquer Godzilla no matter what the cost.  The Escondite is one unique little restaurant, full of color and a little bit of a dark side. I meant it&#39;s dark little light almost a romantic hideaway.    This is a Chicago Blackhawks fan bar also King&#39;s any one who&#39;s a sport fan including hockey need to come to the Escondite. 

The menu is off the charts it&#39;s an 80&#39;s sitcom favorite characters theme. This brings good memories some of the characters my wife and I remember from the 80&#39;s.These were the best years.  The waitress came to the table , asked what we wanted to drink snd if we were ready  to order.We said yes.  I told her right away we want the off the menu item Godzilla destroy Skidrokyo then she gave us a big smile.  She told us it come with fresh made fries from real potatoes but not frozen...

My wife and I love our new hideaway it&#39;s cozy with a western theme/Chicago Blackhawks/ L.A.Kings sport bar.   Our waitress brought us Godzilla destroy Skidrokyo on a basket with his thermal flames aka home made fries. My wife and I couldn&#39;t wait we were two classic monster my is Godzilla and myself King something I can&#39;t His name he have another name Monster Zero.. Any who is Godzilla monsters fan. 

We took a bite at the same wow amazing flavors in the Godzilla destroy Skidrokyo.  We felt we were Godzilla destroy Skidrokyo it was so good we were eating through the sandwich in minutes like Godzilla would do.  The egg, hash brown, the steak, cheese especially the bread came from Chicago combine together the ultimate Godzilla fan dream sandwich.   The home made fries were really good not frozen my wife and I enjoy the fries.

Overall Escondite is the ultimate restaurant/bar for a drink and great food and enjoying the decor plus Blackhawks and King&#39;s fan pad.. I recommend Escondite to my family and friends and including my Yelp friends."

I would say this is more of a spot to catch live music or a sports game (if you are not interested in those, be sure to check sports schedules before you come because it&#39;s really loud inside if there is a game or band on). The food is alright: sandwiches, salads and a kind of interesting selection of quirky burgers (think doughnut buns and mashed potatoes, etc). I find the buns they use to be dry and old tasting and the meat itself is really meh, at $12 for a  burger and some mediocre fries, I would much rather go to The Counter. 

The service is okay, but the happy hour is so misleading. They advertise $5 craft beers - do NOT assume that is every beer. I asked for &#34;any IPA,&#34; my friend asked for any stout and we find out when the bill comes that neither beer was on happy hour. I realize it&#39;s whiney, but they are not explicit in their happy hour price advertising and I can go to almost any place that serves beer in DTLA and get a $5 beer weekdays between 5 and 7pm without having to ask which beer is on happy hour. I have been here about 5 times and this most recent time, they bring out these tiny little 10 oz glasses (every other time I went I got a happy hour price and a full pint). I realize sometimes bars serve IPAs in smaller tulip glasses but that was not the case, because my friend got the baby-sized (yet full priced) glass, too for her stout. I asked the server why the beers were $8 each and she told me anything over 8% alcohol content is not on happy hour. Is that the most bizarre price-determining factor you ever heard? So I have to drink Bud Light if I want a $5 happy beer at this spot, or what?

There are so many great places to get a beer downtown, but the mediocre food, loud vibe that makes conversation near impossible, shady happy hour pricing and tiny beer sizes at the Escondite make it not one I would suggest for your beer n burger rotation."

Their beer is good, they have a cute &#34;outdoor&#34; seating area with a great view of DTLA, and there&#39;s a parking lot (which was free on a Thursday evening, so maybe it&#39;s a weekday thing they offer).

The first time I was here, I was with a group and the server was attentive. For a Friday evening, it was a very chill spot to hang out at. Thank goodness I was in a group though...we walked from J-town and it&#39;s very, very close to skid-row. I&#39;d hate to walk to this place alone at night.

I came here a second time for happy hour and the service wasn&#39;t great. Although we were helped when we first got there, we needed some time to look at the menu to order food...but it took our server a really long time to get back to us. We actually had to get up and find her because we were getting hungry...

Anyways, we got our food pretty fast, but then we asked for napkins and we never got them. Again, we had to get up and go get them from the bar. Also, it wasn&#39;t very busy, but maybe they are short handed?

I won&#39;t give up on this place yet though because I love happy hour and free parking. Plus it&#39;s close to where I work."

First of all, what does Escondite even mean?!  It translates into a some sort of game of &#34;hide and seek.&#34;  Perhaps this is because the place is well hidden between Skid Row and Little Tokyo.

It definitely took me a moment to find this place, but once found, you&#39;ll see that it has a majestic view of DTLA.

For something that&#39;s so deep in LA, it&#39;s a total Chicago bar!  I walked in to find the BlackHawks and Chicago city flag hanging from the ceiling, along with some of Chicago&#39;s favorite foods on the menu:

The Escondite (sandwich):  As Chicago as it gets.  It&#39;s an Italian beef sandwich, with an au jus dip and giardinera peppers.  *My special recommendation, order more giardinera peppers on the side, that&#39;s what makes this awesome*

The Captain Kangaroo:  I tried this the second time I came, I think it&#39;s a good sandwich, but it&#39;s a bit on the savory side.  If I could make an adjustment, I&#39;d add something sweet to it.

The Tacos:  Really enjoyable!

The Drink Deals:  great happy hour!

Overall, I think this place is worth a try. I really enjoy the Chicago pub feel along with the Italian beef sandwich. While the food isn&#39;t 5 star, it definitely meets 4 star needs."

The only possible caveat is the proximity to Skid Row (half-block), but so far as I could tell it wasn&#39;t an issue.

The place is a typical dive bar (probably actually more upscale to be considered a dive bar legitimately). But I think what stood out to me is the skill of the bartenders. They seemed well trained, knew how to mix drinks, tasted their work with a straw to make sure it was right, were cool doing special customer requests and making suggestions to fit each person. . .it just seemed really professional, kind of like how Bar Rescue tells bartenders they should behave.

We walked in around midnight and it was dimly lit with a bar and a bare bones Mumford &amp; Sons sounding band on a teeny-tiny stage in the corner. I had one of those, &#34;This is so L.A.&#34; moments. The Asian female bartender with the purple hair (so L.A.) said we could seat ourselves so we sat outside under the awning?The view of the beautiful downtown L.A. sky scrapers is amazing (and so L.A.) and to know you&#39;re surrounded by skid row is, well...so L.A.

        I would&#39;ve given it 4 stars but the burgers were sub par. I ordered the Don Ho burger and thought the bun was dry and it was ok. I tried my boyfriends slim pikins burger and thought it  was ok as well and would&#39;ve rather had a Red Robin burger. The buffalo deep fried mushrooms were on point.

But once inside, rest assured it&#39;s a nice bar and burger place that makes you feel like your neighborhood bar.  

Service is really good, we had a large group with us and they accommodated a whole section for us.  In the main area is a small stage where they host live local music.  The beer list is very impressive, with an assortment of bottles and beer on tap including some exotic brands.  

The menu is pretty much gourmet burgers and sandwiches, with clever names like the Captain Kangaroo (with breakfast gravy and eggs) Don Ho (pineapple ring) and the Trainwreck to name a few.  I got the boneless chicken wings and fries with chili, which suited me fine.  My table got mostly burgers and they all seemed to really like it.  They also have a really good happy hour, which is $5 beers, $4 cocktails and $3-$5 appetizers T-F 5-8pm, but all night on Mondays which is good esp for basketball.

The Escondite is a Spanish word that means &#34;Hideout&#34;, and honestly, it is well-hidden because I must have driven by the place a million times to hurry on passed Skid Row to get to Little Tokyo.

Located in No-Man&#39;s land, kind of like an unofficial DMZ between Skid Row and Little Tokyo, the only thing that tells you there is a bar here is a blue neon arrow. Once you enter, you will encounter a dimly lit Cowboys-and-Indians-themed place decorated with steer skulls, an Indian statue, and Western posters. 

There is a full bar and a nice beer selection. Perhaps if they stuck to just beer... You see, the food here is pretty bad. For starters, the boneless Buffalo wings had an overpowering sauce and the breading literally fell apart. And they were über stingy with the celery and carrot sticks.

The fried pickles were even worse. The breading was so thick and flavorless it felt like biting into cardboard. Moreover, despite the place being really dark, I could tell that the pickles were inconsistently cooked. Some were burnt while others were undercooked. And that sweet and spicy sauce that you dip the pickles in? It&#39;s standard Mae Ploy spring roll dipping sauce.

The Captain Kangaroo Burger that everyone raves about was an utter disappointment. No idea why it&#39;s called that because there is no kangaroo meat. Instead it&#39;s basically a breakfast burger consisting of a beef patty topped with an egg, hashbrowns, cheese, ham, and gravy. 

The problem with this burger is that for a breakfast-style burger it was bland.  You see, when I think breakfast I think salty-greasy-mess. No amount of Cholula could save this burger from &#34;mundaneness&#34;... wished this burger had just hopped on away. BTW don&#39;t bother upgrading the fries to bacon cheese fries unless you want to pay $17 for a disappointment. 

I guess if I were to come back here it would be strictly for the beer. On second thought, like Custer&#39;s last stand, there won&#39;t be a sequel."

This place has been on my list for a long time, so was super excited coming in. Did not expect it to be a dive bar, but dive bars are great, so yay! The bar was fully decked out in holiday decorations including santa suit chairs, a bell dangling from the wall, santa drinking, and various holiday decorations throughout. 

Since it was happy hour, we happily indulged in a few drinks as well as appetizers- mozzerella sticks and buffalo mushrooms. The mozzerella sticks were perfect, and the buffalo mushrooms were interesting. It was smeared in buffalo sauce and lightly fried. It also came with carrots and celery which was great with ranch. As for burgers, the best part...

Fat Albert, $11- I decided on this because of the glazed doughnut buns with applewood smoked bacon, medium rare patty, provolone, and maple syrup. Pure. heaven. I did not expect everything to go so well together, but it was absolutely amazing. I thought the burger would be heavy but it wasn&#39;t at all; it was the perfect amount. They also flip the doughnut buns inside out so you won&#39;t get glaze all over your fingers. 

Captain Kangaroo, $13- egg over easy, hash brown, cheddar, canadian bacon, breakfast gravy and cholula. Although this burger was messier than the fat albert (surprisingly), it was also just as delicious in an entirely different way. While Fat Albert was sweet and savory, this was more of a breakfast burger with the egg and the hash brown. 

Both burgers were of a good size and definitely finishable. We also got the bourbon pecan pie; it came out nice and hot, and the pie was full of flavor. Everything we had was yummy, and the burgers was what sealed the deal. The bill was around $65/70 (including drinks) so it was very decently priced for the amount of food we received.

As was the case with this place. I am sure you get an entirely different vibe if you Uber or drive directly to their parking lot, but I walked from the metro station on a Sunday around 12 in the afternoon and the closer I got to this place, the more I questioned if I took a wrong turn somewhere. 

After passing a couple desolated streets and some homeless people I came to The Escondite located on Boyd St, where the stretch of road between San Pedro and Omar was rather lively (again, if you Uber or drive directly to this point, the surrounding area doesn&#39;t really become a factor). 

To its credit, The Escondite is a mans bar where sports and beer is the primary reason to visit; not for arcade games (82) or a game of bean bag toss (Angel City), however, I never understood sports bars that cater to a single city of teams. So, unless your team is the Bears, or are playing against the Bears, will you get to watch another group of teams play if it&#39;s going on simultaneously as the Bears game?  

Not a big fan of cementing a Yelp review based off of one visit, so I&#39;ll head back and check it out again to get a better feel for the place."

I just moved into the neighboorhood and decided to tryout this place to watch some sports today. I wanted to watch the Spanish La Liga title race and there were a couple of good games on. The bartender told me that they can put it, but at noon, the blackhawks were playing so they would have to switch to that. I said no problem the games end before noon. I proceeded to order the &#34;Christopher Walken&#34; from the brunch menu and a side of fries. 

Everything was fine until one of the staff came over and switch the tv to cycling. My cries of &#34;oooh we are watching that&#34; went unanswered. The bartender came by and apologized and meekly try to give &#34;this is the channel the blackhawks game is on and the preview should start soon&#34;. I pointed out that its 20 min to noon and no previews of the blackhawk game is on. She said let me see what i can do. The same staff member came by with this annoyed look and changed the channel..... to the wrong soccer game. I pointed it out and he just walked away. Then he came back and stood behind me to check at what time this game ended and walked away again.

At that point i decided ok im not welcomed here. I asked for the check and left. No tip. Its a shame cause the food was tasty but when you feel unwelcomed everything tastes sour and you just want to get out of there.

The outdoor space offers a much more contemporary (and quiet) environment, with one of the better views of Dtown, looking west into the sunset. 

Food is good for a country-style bar, and prices are reasonable all around.  The service is marginal, as many have noted (not including management, apparently).  Looks understaffed on the floor....I saw only two servers covering a house that was packed, both inside and out.  One was on top of her game; one was indifferent.  Fix this = 5 stars.

Huge bonus is the spacious parking lot, which appears to be free every night.  Escondite means &#34;hideout,&#34; a perfect name as the joint is hard to spot...until you know to look for the blue neon arrow, which is easy to see from San Pedro St.  The bar&#39;s on the edge of &#34;The Nickel,&#34; or Skid Row, but if you want to walk from Little Tokyo, no big deal.  Boyd St. is a safe 1 1/2 blocks from 2nd St."

Places like umami, the counter and so many more have filled the streets of downtown LA making the choices a bit difficult. Let me make your life a bit easier, go ahead and add The Escondite to your bookmarks.

Parking shouldn&#39;t be an issue here since the place has it&#39;s own parking lot. The entrance is through the parking lot and next to the exterior patio area which provides a nice view of the skyscrapers of DTLA. The interior is dark and moody, with pops of orange and red lighting providing a mellow ambience. Everything looks to be reminiscent of a time that has past on and it all works together.

I ordered the hip hop sandwich which is a roast beef sandwich with pickles BBQ sauce and bell peppers and it came with fries. My co workers each ordered something different with an assortment of beers. The wait wasn&#39;t to long since it was around 12 when we arrived and there were only about 4 other customers inside and we were the only customers outside in the patio area. 

The food was brought out and I kid you not my mouth watered, it all looked delish! I snapped a few pics and dug in. The fries are large cut and fried to a golden color and sprinkled with chives. They were bomb! The sandwich was amazing, roast beef was tender and slathered with a perfect amount of BBQ sauce. The veggies inside all worked in harmony with the meat and the bread was soft without to much crunch to the outside.

The place is cool, the food is great the service is on point, what more could you ask for? I will most definitely be back."

Gezellig, something hard to find in DTLA. They have very tasty cocktails and pretty typical bar food. I like that it&#39;s not trying to be some pretentious place like every other new bar in the area. Kind of wish the bartenders were nicer and that one in particular would put back on her pants.

Luckily for us they had a small parking lot (sometimes costing $6) or street parking meters. We were seated in their patio area which had huge tables to accommodate large groups or bar like seating to enjoy the beautiful city skyline.

We were quickly seated and introduced to their happy hour (their house wines are delicious). I ordered buffalo mushrooms as my appetizer with my entree being the Trainwreck sandwich and upgraded gravy fries. The Trainwreck was a mild heart attack with greasy meats including pepperoni. To make sure I left feeling as terrible as possible, I enjoyed my gravy fries with cheese. Overall the meal was probably a little salty since I found myself drinking a lot of water/wine but it wasn&#39;t overly salty that I noticed in any other way. I actually didn&#39;t finish my entire sandwich here even though the portions were good -- just wasn&#39;t hitting the spot for me. The fries were almost cleaned out but of course, due to the steak-like size of them, I hadn&#39;t finished. Almost did though.

The patio is dog friendly, as we saw some dogs around, but it wasn&#39;t near to any vagrants or anything like that, so that was pleasant. Overall the area was pretty safe even though it was dark. The bathrooms included two stalls and the inside was pretty much a bar setting and open kitchen. I would say this place really excelled at the bar food or gastropub, but the sandwiches were lacking. No one from our party ordered a burger, so I wouldn&#39;t be able to tell you about it, but seeing as most people around us ordered sandwiches, I&#39;m led to believe it was a smart choice. But, who knows. Yelp seems to like their burgers.

Anyway, I will definitely be back. Their appetizers and fries have won me over, as well as their happy hour deals. In terms of actually eating though, this might just be a bar hopping stop for me."

Admittedly I&#39;m not that into hockey, but it&#39;s hard not to get into it here.  The crowd here is live and raucous.  It is infectious and even if you know nothing about the Blackhawks, you may find yourself screaming when they score a touchdown...jk...just seeing if you&#39;re still reading....

Went here with the guys for a Guys night and we were not disappointed.  It was crowded and loud due to the Blackhawks game that was playing...(yes, this review is a tad bit late).  But it was great.  

Food:  I got fries (see how I put that first..ha ha...good fries), the Dr. Joyce Brothers burger...with the Special Crunch of the Slim Pickens....wanna know what it is...wait for it...Funyans....so damn good....

Price: $$....It&#39;s not McDonalds after all...Worth it.  Don&#39;t be a cheapo.....

Parking:  If there was a weak point, it&#39;s the parking.  There is a small lot on site but metered street parking is your best bet when it&#39;s crowded. There are nearby lots as well that offer parking.  

Service:  Great.  Our waitress was friendly, happy, and easy on the eyes ( Yes she was attractive...all right....).  

Verdict:  It&#39;s a great spot to hit up for food and drinks....I would def repeat if I can get a guys night again.  Good food, good drinks...good times...Little Tokyo is nearby too if you need someplace to go...Karaoke, sake, knock yourself out."
the-escondite-los-angeles,Tai T.,tJFsL7d-lJ1Ksv_sqViXcQ,"Lincoln Heights, Los Angeles, CA",0,1,0,15,23,8_yNNaqKyh_gYFC4y4vzug,4.0,2015-11-19,"I came here alone on a Friday night (11/13/15) just to check out the spot. I&#39;ve been meaning to get around to this particular bar since my favorite bar in Little Tokyo (RIP Oiwake) went out of business and closed its doors at the end of September and I was looking for a bar that would take its place. 

To start things off, this place has their own dedicated FREE parking lot. Yes, you read that right. FREE parking lot. (That&#39;s like unheard of in DTLA). And it&#39;s spacious, might I add. Apparently, they share one half of their space with the Mumford Brewery next door but it&#39;s still a lot of parking spaces. So far as I can tell, the lot hardly ever gets filled. It certainly wasn&#39;t packed to capacity last Friday night but there were definitely a lot of cars parked there that night. 

Once inside the spot, I kind of felt lost. Namely, I didn&#39;t know if I could just pick a table and sit down, wait and let the waiter/waitress show me to a table, or just go up to the front of the bar and start ordering. (Every bar has their own rules. Far Bar, for instance, won&#39;t let you order booze at the bar if you&#39;re planning to sit at one of the tables but instead require a waiter or waitress to take your order and then they would run over to the bar, get your drinks, and then hand them to your table). The bartenders at this spot were just running left and right not paying the least bit of attention that a tall ass Asian guy just stepped foot into their establishment. After 5 minutes of just standing there without getting any kind of acknowledgment from anyone, not even the barback, I just decided to stop one of the fast moving bartenders and asked whether I can just pick a table and sit down or pick a spot at a bar. She, the Black female bartender (I think?), said that I could pick a table or the bar. Doesn&#39;t matter. But she said that there was a reservation for the entire table area at 8pm or so. (That would be the area immediately to your right once you enter through their doors, by the way). Right when you enter the bar, there&#39;s like a reception-like area right in front of you but no one was really standing there, which made it a bit confusing. The bar area is to your left and on the far end of that side is a stage where presumably a live band would be able to perform. There&#39;s also a few small booths on the &#34;bar side&#34; as well. Restrooms are to your right from the entrance, down the hall past the kitchen area, and to the left. (Restrooms were clean and sanitary, if that&#39;s a concern. Also some neat stuff on the walls to look at while you&#39;re taking a piss).  

Ambiance. It&#39;s loud. Like unbelievably loud. Background music is constantly playing some kind of country rock music but would cycle through, apparently, lounge/downtempo music, to heavy metal and back to something more like American pop. The crowd seems to be predominantly white people.

Food. I ordered the Fat Albert (I&#39;ve heard a lot good things about this burger), Boneless Chicken strips with BBQ sauce and ranch for dipping. Plus, I ordered a beer off of their chalkboard. I asked for the darkest beer that they have on draft. I think it was Saison something or other. Good beer though. Had a nutty, chocolate-like texture. Really smooth. Totally recommend this beer. The Fat Albert definitely surpassed my expectations. It&#39;s two donuts, grilled, for burger buns, a slab of burger meat, bacon, cheese, and onions. (I think?) It was sweet, salty, and savory. Interesting combination but it went really well with each other flavor wise. I would recommend this burger, if you&#39;re curious. Fries and chicken? Nothing special. They tasted as they should. No complaints there. 

Service. The White female bartender at the bar was really nice, friendly, and attentive. She got me what I wanted fairly quickly. She checked up on me every so while to see if I needed anything else. Cool gal. Can&#39;t really complain about her. There was also another female bartender, an Asian one who looks like the smurf (not sure why that popped into my head but when I saw her with her blue hair, the first word that popped into my mind was &#34;Man, she looks like a smurf!&#34;) She was nice too. She also checked up on me every so while making everything was alright and if I needed anything. No complaints about these two. 

Overall, I&#39;m dinging this spot one star because it&#39;s really hard to talk to anyone since it&#39;s so loud with the music blaring in the background. I had to speak pretty loudly to the bartender and she had to lean in to hear what I wanted to order. Other than that, this place looks like a neat spot for live music, for some food and beers, and to watch ESPN. There were two TV&#39;s situated at the front of the bar, if you&#39;re wondering. I&#39;d probably be back to see what it&#39;s like when live bands are playing.

All in all, you should definitely check out this spot. It seems like a pretty solid bar albeit with loud music constantly playing. Nevertheless, I&#39;d say give it a shot."

Let&#39;s start with the positives:  I loved the &#39;70s and &#39;80s pop culture references on the menu.  Don&#39;t believe me?  Then check the menu out for yourself, where you&#39;ll find selections like, Mr. Miyagi, Boss Hogg, Gavin MacLeod, Mr. Furley, the Re-Run, the Elvis and the Louie DePalma.  Don&#39;t worry if you&#39;re too young to get all those references...luckily for you, The Escondite&#39;s burgers by any other name, would still taste as sweet. 

As a breakfast fan, I had to order the Captain Kangaroo, which was a burger topped with an egg over easy, hash browns, cheddar cheese, Canadian Bacon, breakfast gravy and Cholula.  As you can imagine, it was messy AND delicious! If there really is a Heaven, I hope I can eat like this every day with no health consequences.

The service?  Ever have one of those dining experiences where from the moment you walk in, you can tell the server is NOT happy you&#39;re there?  In this case, I was forced to do the unthinkable and leave a tip way under the 20% threshold.  I felt terrible doing that, but I felt worse sitting there feeling like my order was an imposition on my server.  

At least she was pretty...on the outside."

BUT, great, rotating beer selection (do wish they offered some Chicago/Midwest brews).  Overall, our favorite lunch spot on Sundays especially during football season.

Their attempt at quirky comes off as lame.  Naming menu items after 70s B-celebrities is something my mom might think is &#34;cute&#34; but she also thought dressing me for my first day of school in lederhosen would be cute as well, and look how fucked up I am because of it.  Oh look!  A hamburger named after Herve Villechaize!  How droll.  And the whole &#34;hootenanny&#34; style decor (with live Bluegrass!&#34;) was fun five years ago, but now every hipster hole in the wall has played out that twangy tune.  So over it.

The food is just okay.  Their huevos rancheros (i.e. the Freddie Prinze) were decent as was their vegetarian sandwich (they call their sandwiches &#34;Sandos&#34; which I suppose is only slightly less annoying than &#34;Sammiches.&#34;), as is the pricing.  

The &#34;signature&#34; cocktails are more like the illiterate scrawl of an X.  I&#39;ve tried three different drinks, and two out of the three were god-awful.  I would have dumped them into the planter boxes, but I was afraid they would kill the plants.  So instead I just left them sitting out on the picnic benches outside.   No wonder the patio is swarming with flies.

The only reason this place gets two stars is because they have an excellent beer menu.  So, in other words, the only thing extraordinary about the place is the stuff they don&#39;t make themselves.

But the worst offense is their customer service.  I thought I might have left my wallet here (turns out I left it in a cab), and I called THREE times about it.  The first time I left a message on an answering machine (even though it was business hours) and no one called me back.  The second time, I was told that only the manager had the key to the safe and she was gone on an errand and would be &#34;back in 20 minutes&#34; and would call me back.  No such luck.  Finally, on the third time, I was told that they didn&#39;t think they had it, but they weren&#39;t actually sure, and that they would call me back when they were sure.  No call back.  

Guess who else won&#39;t be calling back?"

We were lucky enough to get a parking spot in their mini lot but I could see how finding parking otherwise would be difficult. 

We ordered four carne asada tacos, two beef tongue tacos, and nachos. The total came to almost $20. It took about twenty minutes to receive our food dining in. When we received our food there was so much meat! More than your average taco truck gives I think.

My sister loved Happy Taco&#39;s nachos the first time they ate here, so I was totally game for having dinner here.

There was one spot left in their small parking lot, so we got lucky.  Otherwise, you&#39;d have to do street parking on their super busy street. Order at the window, and find a seat at their outdoor dining area.  

I did a quick survey and it looked like everyone had an order of Super Nachos on his/her table. We had two orders, one for me and the hubby, and one for my sister and her family.  If you don&#39;t like Velveeta cheese, don&#39;t order the nachos, as that&#39;s the kind of cheese they pour on the chips.  I don&#39;t mind eating Velveeta cheese once in a while, so it was fine with me.  They poured just enough cheese on top to &#34;flavor&#34; the chips without getting them soggy. There was also a nice amount of steak (which was not gristly thank God), chunky guacamole, sour cream and salsa on top.  One of the best nachos I&#39;ve had in a while!

My husband ordered Super Tacos with Steak, and my sister&#39;s husband ordered a Quesadilla, which was quite cheesy. I loved their chips so much, I ordered a bag of chips with salsa to go, so I can munch on them by the pool the next day.  Thankfully the chips were still nice and crunchy when we snacked on them the next day.  

Definitely coming back here. The food was really good and it was by far our least expensive meal when we were in LA!"

I wonder if they deliver or something because there was almost no one else there for that to happen. The woman taking the orders was odd and very much deer in headlights when I was talking to her and when I was following up on my food. I ended up with a shrimp burrito supreme which was just ok.

And I say this solely on the mere fact that they add a bit of pineapple in almost every dish. An experiment? Maybe, successful? Heck yes! 

I was so excited by the menu I decided to try 5 dishes between 2 people. Starting with the al pastor tostada. I can&#39;t say it&#39;s better than el taurino&#39;s in terms of flavor, but it&#39;s a close second and much more fresh going at a cheaper price for $2.95. Second are the tacos. I&#39;m not usually a big fan of Mole (sweet black sauce), but the meat in the mole taco just melts in your mouth. The al pastor is a must for the taco, and I&#39;ll recommend trying the pork chorizo tacos as well. Thirdly, the super nachos are absolutely delicious and garnished to perfection with pineapple, avocado, onions, etc. all for $6.88. We also decided to go with the special chefs torta which comprised of  milanesa, grilled ham, and pineapple. This was the most expensive at $9. To finish it off I had to order myself the famous La Gringa Torta. Absolutely mind blown by how well Pastor mixes with pineapple and the layer of chipotle aoli they put in there. 

The parking lot in the back is small, and so is the outside seating area. But when you&#39;re dishing out superb quality dishes with an awesome staff, a mediocre setting becomes a non-factor."

They use good quality asada meat and dress it up the way I like it - lots of sour cream and jalapeños. Rather than using shredded cheese like most places, they use melted nacho cheese. The fries are of the fat variety which can sustain the douse of heavy melted cheese. The fries are topped with fresh salsa. Oh so good.

It&#39;s pricey - my order 8 bucks or so. Definitely a nice addition to the area."

Driving by this place all the time since it opened, I&#39;ve always been amazed at how incredibly cute and happy this place looks. Animated lighted signs, mural, red umbrellas, and a sign with a very cute and happy taco graphic... So happy. Finally decided to give this place a try after I had seen that it had great reviews on yelp! 
First off, the small small parking lot: it appears that it only had about 5 spaces max. If there isn&#39;t a spot, street parking is a possibility. However, it&#39;s a little hard to come by. 

The food: 
1) Chicken Mole taco, Chorizo Taco &amp; Rice and Beans: (Combo - $~5.45) Guisados downtown has some competition. Both tacos weren&#39;t greasy, were generously filled with meat, and had lots of flavor! The chicken mole was soft and had the right amount of filling--wasn&#39;t sloppy or overflowing. The chorizo taco was crunchy, with a good amount of onion and cilantro. Standard rice and beans. 

2) Chicken Quesadilla with chips and salsa: ($~6.45) Pretty great! The chicken and cheese were good quality. The salsas that came with the quesadilla, as well as the chips and salsa, weren&#39;t too spicy, and had perfect amounts for the meal. 

Overall, a really great spot for tacos, nachos, burritos, and (apparently) carne asada fries. Great prices, great vibes, and a very cute spot. 4 stars because it didn&#39;t blow me away. (But that might change, since it looks like the carne asada fries are great!) Definitely will be coming back to try more of the menu."

I sure was happy after eating the tacos de tinga and mole; however the boyfriend was not pleased with their wet burrito. In his words the meat was dry, and that to me is a deal breaker in any plate that involves meat.

Pricing for most things seems average, although the tacos de tinga and mole will run you a little but more. They&#39;re worth it though, in my opinion. They accept credit cards. 

I was quoted a 15-20 minute wait on a pick-up order but ended up waiting 35 minutes. I was a little hangry by the time I got my food. The wait seems to be pretty long when they&#39;re busy, so plan accordingly. 

Parking is a pain in the ass since they&#39;re right on the corner, but if you&#39;re lucky enough to score a spot either on the street or in their tiny lot, then definitely give them a try. I&#39;ll be back to try more of their food."

Swung by here before a Dodgers&#39; game with my brother to grab some tacos and enjoy them during the game.  For those of you that don&#39;t know, Dodgers stadium allows outside food and some beverages.* 

As it wasn&#39;t &#34;cheat day&#34;, I couldn&#39;t bring myself to order the carne asada fries, so I tried their tacos instead.  One each of:

Tinga de pollo - shredded chicken breast in chipotle sauce
Cabeza - beef cheek
Carne asada - grilled beef

The carne asada was delicious (as others have noted), but I really felt the tinga de pollo was a stand-out.  The cabeza was good too, but paled in comparison to the carne asda and tinga de pollo.  This means the next time I swing by it will be:

1. Cheat day!
2. Carne asada fries.
3. Tinga de pollo tacos.

Oh yeah, Dodgers beat the Giants, 3-2.  Go Dodgers!

I know what you&#39;re thinking, this review has three stars why would I go here? To that I say it&#39;s about pricing, parking and  seating. The food is average, but the pricing makes it good, the seating outside in the world makes it even better, and there large drinks are huge! I brought my girlfriend here (as every foodie couple should) she ordered their nacho&#39;s along with some tacos while I order their torta cubana. First thing off the bat is the naco&#39;s have the least amount of ingredients and it&#39;s all placed at the top of the meal so it&#39;s not even distributed.  Which makes it hard to eat around, you don&#39;t want to take from the top since there so little, and when you do get a chip it&#39;s dry and alone. Secondly their torta cubana is smaller then others (either way it gets the job done), you&#39;ll be full by the end. Like I said before though the ambient of this place is what I liked a lot. So enjoy &amp; thank you to the cooks for good service!"

I&#39;ve ordered the Carne Asada Tacos &amp; the Carne Asada Nachos &amp; they are the bomb! The Carne Asada is so flavorful &amp; delicious, not like other restaurants that seem to use cheaper meat. The Tacos are super small so you will definitely need to order more than one or two if you&#39;re hungry but at $1.38 it&#39;s a good deal! The Carne Asada Nachos are salivating, they load on Carne Asada bits &amp; use melted nacho cheese. Omg, I could eat it everyday.. The Chicken Quesadilla is also a winner!

You just walk up to the window &amp; order from the menu which is posted on the window. There are so many options but I&#39;m sure anything you order will be great!

I knew I ate way too much food because 5 minutes after leaving, I felt my eyelids getting very heavy = I was in a deep food coma and ended up taking a 2 hour nap afterwards.  However, there was a reason I ate too much..the food here is good.  

We ended up getting the carnitas combo plate, carne asada fries, and the la gringa torta.  The food is really solid and delicious.  The carnitas was tender, just like how it looked in the pictures.  It wasn&#39;t half fat like at some other places.  The rice and beans were perfect.  

The carne asada fries, although not the best I&#39;ve had, are up there with some of the best.  There is a generous amount of carne asada and I liked the use of the nacho cheese.  This itself could probably feed 1-2 people.  

The la gringa torta was good.  At first, I thought it was kind of pricey for a torta; however, it is 2 tortas that come out. I&#39;ve never had a combination like that before in a torta and with the thick slices of ham and pineapple, it had a lot of flavor.  However, I couldn&#39;t taste the al pastor and I could&#39;ve done without the lettuce and tomatoes.  

I&#39;m bumping them up to a 5 star because of the friendly atmosphere. The guy that took the order came out to see how we were doing.  Small things like that are well appreciated.  

Will be back but definitely going to rein it in a little with the amount of food next time."

Nevertheless I gave it shot and ate the carne Asada fries. Didn&#39;t disappoint ;the carne was good, good flavor, good texture and tasted good. Missed the good ol&#39; days of meat eating. But for now I will try only the chicken dishes and or items they sell at Happy Taco which is my choice because I don&#39;t eat red meat.

Only downside is they charge something really pricey like $1.50 or something to add cheese or avocado. For avocado, okay fine, but $1.50 for cheese?! It&#39;s a little much in my opinion. But I just go home and put my own cheese on my food, so it isn&#39;t really an issue."

This time I used Eat24 to order take-out ahead of time. Got there a few minutes early and food was ready already, which was great. Same quality as last time, though I tried their chicken mole taco&#39;s and there was a weird flavor that I didn&#39;t really like, but overall, the food was good. 

While it was great that the food was ready early, I&#39;d prefer they make it on time instead, because if I had been late the food would have been sitting around getting cold for 4+ minutes.

4 stars is really solid in my book. I will be going back!"

After months of waiting for this place to open, it finally has!! As a vegetarian Latina, there is no greater feeling than a vegetarian menu or vegetarian options. For my first trip there I ordered some nachos. I figured it was some regular nachos with some avocado. What I got was way better! The nachos included grilled onions, grilled bell peppers, grilled mushrooms and even grilled squash (most commonly known as Mexican squash or calabacitas, similar to zucchini) plus jalapeños, nacho cheese, sour cream, pico de gallo and avocado. I can&#39;t be sure but I believe the nachos tasted home made, like they were made there and not just any store bought nachos. But don&#39;t take my word for it! Go check them out, I&#39;m sure the non-vegetarian options are just as great!

A cheese burger with lettuce,tomato,pickle, and onion. A big portion of fries and a juice box. They also gave him a little coloring book with crayons and stickers.

My girlfriend and I ordered 1 &#34;La Gringa&#34;, which is a &#34;Torta w/ Queso, Ham, Pineapple, and Al Pastor Meat&#34;. We also added 2 carne asada tacos and 2 (some kind of shredded chicken) tacos. The La Gringa was extremely filling and all the food was well-seasoned. The cashier was very friendly and upbeat, and the chef/cook/owner(?) came out to the patio to greet us. He even brought with him 2 small cups of horchata free for us to sample. 

There&#39;s a small parking lot behind the shop - a few reserved parking spots, but if you drive a little further there are more spots with no &#34;No Parking&#34; signs; there are also a few metered parking spots on the street. Plenty of seats and tables in their patio!

Happy Taco does make nachos and they&#39;re great!!! My favorite thing here is the carne asada nachos. Their menu ventures into the slightly experimental with stuff like the Torta Cubana, which has Milanesa, lomo adobado, ham and a sausage and their Hawaiin Torta. Definitely a great change of pace from a regular torta. My favorite meat so far has been the carne asada. Their pastor isn&#39;t the best, but it&#39;s decent."

My new favorite Mexican food restaurant. I had a California burrito, which was a real treat. The burrito was perfect in terms of consistency and the fries inside the burrito were delicious.

In terms of location and getting there it is just a quick drive from USC and downtown and there was a parking lot (which we used, although I think it&#39;s for the tenants living in the apartments connected and next to Happy Taco).

The outdoor seating was perfect for a sunny day, so I would recommend stopping by while it is nice out. They have glass walls separating the seating from Vermont so it feels like you are isolated from all the traffic.

The only two negatives were that it is cash only and they do not have horchata."

Got busy over the course of time that we arrived and only had 1 server. She did her best to offer reccomendations and did not dissapoint. 

Interior: ample space and clean

Food: sampled chilaquilles served all day and were amazing! Had the deluxe burger and was not in the mood for carb overload so was thinking on ditching bun but it comes with super thin sliced bread. Tempeh was tasty.

Will definitely be back to try more of their menu."

Best chilaquiles, this side of LA. Pretty darn close to the chilaquiles from Follow your heart in Canoga Park. 

Their vegan crepes are amazing. I had the savory crepes (the Pollo and the Bon Apetit) and the sweet crepes and they&#39;re all divine. 

The cakes in their glass cake look amazing! I&#39;ve had a few of them (chocolate, green tea) and they are slightly on the dry side, so needs some work there."

Even my boyfriend likes it and he&#39;s generally not a big fan of vegan places! 

I usually get either the falafel wrap or the deluxe burger. The deluxe burger is my favorite because the patty both tastes good and is a good texture, and I love the tempeh &#34;bacon&#34; and the avocado. With both these options you can get either potatoes or a side salad. The side salad has quinoa, tomatoes, and mixed greens, which is nice; it&#39;s not just a lettuce afterthought like many side salads at other places can be. The roasted potatoes are good too, although I wish the dipping sauce was a little more interesting than plain ketchup. 

The coffee here is decent but not amazing, and one time I got a mint mocha but it was WAY too minty. They offer both almond and soy milk for coffee. 

There&#39;s a parking lot, but be warned - it is SUPER tiny. A few times I&#39;ve had to park on the street because the lot was full. Also, this place is not fast, so I highly recommend ordering online or by phone beforehand if you&#39;re getting food to go."

I ordered the veggie burger which was fantastic. I also had the Greek plate, the lettuce was brown and it was pretty much inedible, but I called them to see if they would make me a new plate fresh without the brown lettuce. They happily said yes. I will be in this week to grab it hopefully. 

But they have really looking nice cakes and desserts. 

I would say if you are in the Pico Union area this is a good stop for some pretty decent Vegan food!"

They offer a vegan milkshake: ice blended maca, cacao, coconut milk, and vanilla coconut ice cream. (Can&#39;t wait to try this!). 

They also offer a list of healthy vegan smoothies including a Sun Butter smoothie: Sun Butter, banana, cacao nibs, raw maca, dates, and almond milk. (Can&#39;t wait to try this too!). 

The vegan desserts look so good! I bought a slice of the Green Tea cake. It didn&#39;t taste like green tea, but it was freaking GOOD! I also ordered the Deluxe  Burger with a  side green salad...looking at it, I wasn&#39;t too sure how it would taste, but it was bomb! 

Overall, I really like this place and I&#39;m giving it 5 stars as a Kudos for being a Vegan cafe that&#39;s not on the Westside, which gives people who might not be hip to healthy eating a chance to experience something nutritionally Awesome!

The sauce brings everything together into a cohesive unit.

For dessert, I had the chocolate chip cookie which was delicious! Now I love chocolate chip cookies with eggs and flour. But this vegan chocolate chip cookie was bomb! 

I also had the bread pudding which was delicious. It&#39;s made of cashews, raisins and spelt flour and spices including cinnamon and nutmeg. It also has a caramel sauce and soy whipped cream. It&#39;s delicious! I would ask for extra soy whipped cream if I were you.

I came here with a friend in hopes of getting a light meal while we worked on some stuff. We were quickly disappointed. From the lack of attention by the wait staff, to the mediocre dishes, this place is nothing to rave about. 

Our waitress, who was friendly nonetheless, took forever to serve us. Keep in mind, this was a Sunday afternoon and it was not busy. Before we ordered, we were asked to move tables to accommodate for a bigger party (that could have easily sat elsewhere seeing that the place was NOT packed) which was annoying since we had been waiting for about 15 minutes to even order in the first place. The coffee I ordered  took forever to arrive and wasn&#39;t hot upon arrival. Once the food arrived, my friends order was incorrect and the staff insinuated we had ordered something different. We waited for his food to arrive, once again incorrect (he asked for no onions, behold, this new plate had onions) but were too frustrated to even bother saying anything at that point. 

The quality of the food was subpar, salsa from a can, no flavor, just not worth the money. Honestly just seemed like a place that offers vegetarian options to hype up the prices on their blah dishes.

Oh and we never got the wifi code so no work was accomplished here since our waitress went missing for the rest of our bland and sad meal and there seemed to be no one else that worked here in sight.

My friend ended up getting his meal free after pointing out that the order had been brought out wrong twice and was, a nice gesture that still won&#39;t be enough to ever bring us back."

My ONLY critique is that I wish the staff was better trained. I&#39;ve had them forget or mess up my order a handful of times.. I would like to think that it&#39;s because this place gets so busy. It might also be because I usually come here alone so the server sees no need to write down my order as I am only one person. Regardless, I&#39;m sure everyone is doing their best.

May order gluten free vegan dessert too!

Ok so the Raw Vegan Cheesecake (non-dairy of course) is very tasty; not light &amp; fluffy but dense with a rather dense crust. I take it as is, with no expectations of what &#34;real cheesecake&#34; is like. That helps! May be too heavy after all that food!

My first visit there, I ordered a Build Your Own macrobiotic plate, with &#34;Garlicky Greens&#34;, Black Beans and I chose Marinara for my sauce. It was excellent, and basic. Nothing needed salt, it was hot, and clean.

For a drink, the Ice Blended Maca is great, almost as decadent as a milkshake but the Maca gives it an earthy, &#34;healthy&#34; taste. Surprisingly sweet, and a good replacement for a Frappucino or anything similar. 

The hot Moringa tea is also delicious, with a light Matcha taste and a deep, rich milky coating on the end. A light aftertaste.

Chicken Tacos and Chorizo and Eggs are fresh options for the more advanced Vegan eater, as they employ things like Tempeh and Tofu and Seitan...for the whole &#34;fake meat&#34; texture thing. But as a carnivore, you can&#39;t fool me. 

Chips that don&#39;t come from a bag alongside fresh guacamole is a plus.

Lots of people come here just for dessert and a drink, which is also a good choice. The desserts are bomb, for lack of better words. You can&#39;t tell the difference between their cakes and other non-vegan bakery items. They are just as sweet and decadent, as are the selections on their extensive drink menu. Hot Maca doesn&#39;t taste like replacement Hot Chocolate (sorry), but Ice Blended is definitely along those lines. The Mango smoothie with Goji Berries on top is delicious and is a wonderful option to-go on a Hot L.A. Day.

I had the &#34;make your own&#34; plate and did 4 item choices with daily veggie, veggie mix, tofu marinated and Mexican Rice with house special sauce. Everything was really just OK. Tofu was extremely salty to me. Veggie mix is steamed squash and carrot. Mexican rice was half raw and grainy, again salty. 

Pretty expensive for the small portion you get.

Charger smoothie was okay but at almost $10, I felt was not worth it.

There is many other options for organic vegan food in the area."

Don&#39;t let the fact that Grain Cafe is in a nondescript strip mall fool you -- the food is high quality and tasty! I generally order the chicken club sandwich (add avocado) or one of the Mexican dishes (e.g., street tacos, wet burrito, etc.). They also have a bunch of amazing desserts and juices. Definitely worth the trip from any part of LA for vegans and non-vegans alike."

Firstly, the server kept ignoring my table until long after I finished eating. I had to approach her at the bar and ask to close out. Secondly, the bill was over stated by $2 because they charged for gluten free bread - a few that is NOT DISCLOSED on the menu. I pointed this out to the waitress and she simply stated &#34;oh, I&#39;ll tell the manager, we always charge for gluten free bread&#34;. She did not offer a refund. Annoying."

Yelp says they&#39;re a good vegan option, but carnivores, and sugar-aholics, will also find something that suits their fancy on the menu. Upon entrance you&#39;re met with a pastry bar to the left. Red velvet cupcakes, cheesecake and carrot cake beckoned me at first glance. The back wall is lit up in colored lights displaying a tiled water feature. You can sit in a booth right by the fountain if you care to. They have wifi, and I saw a few customers on their laptops while they had lunch.

I ordered the falafel wrap and the chicken curry wrap. I can&#39;t decide which one I like better. The falafel was moist but not gooey, a perfect texture inside the spinach wrap. The chicken curry was a little sweet rather than spicy, almost like chicken salad but with a dressing that was a little more runny than mayo. I want to try some of the desserts and the chicken club sandwich. This is a great healthy option near my new digs. I&#39;m excited to return!"

I wasn&#39;t that hungry when I came in so I ordered a cheese quesadilla. My friend ordered the grilled veggie wrap with roasted potatoes as well as a Mandingo(?) Latte. My quesadilla and guac was really good. My friend said her wrap was good. I tried the roasted potato-- too dry for my taste. The latte was good.

We then ordered dessert- she got a coconut truffle and I got the coconut cake. I&#39;ve had flourless cake before which was fine-- I was not a fan of the coconut cake here - it was a little too and the texture was a little off. My friend said the truffle was really good- she practically licked the chocolate sauce off her plate. 

My only issue with this place was how long it took to get the food when it wasn&#39;t that busy inside the restaurant. However, this could&#39;ve been because there was a steady stream of people picking up food to go. 

The cafe was certainly what I expected. It wasn&#39;t terrible, but it wasn&#39;t spectacular."

Now the parking lot is VERY small so it took us a while to find parking but then again that is not the restaurants fault. Just giving you a little warning. We ordered the ham and pineapple pizza, a sandwich, Guac and chips and some drinks. My mother was very impressed with the taste of my horchata. Honestly everything seems to just be delicious here. When we were leaving they even gave my mom a rose! Thought that was super sweet and it made her day. Thank you~ :)"

The decor is unique and tasteful, great ambiance in wood and tile.  Parking situation is pretty good but I didn&#39;t go at peak hours.

I ordered the Reuben with a salad and the pumkin spice latte from the special menu.  I don&#39;t usually get froofroo coffee drinks but it&#39;s rare to see such a thing in Vegan and it was Chicago today so I went for it.

It was delicious, though if you usually go for black coffee like me it will seem a little under-caffeinated.

The REUBEN was AWESOME.  I have been on a Holy Quest for a good Reuben since I saw the green light of Vegan Jesus and today I found it.  This VReuben stomps on its lesser brethren from Floré and other high-end places I have been.  STOMPS.

Tempeh was chewy and flavorful, sauerkraut brisk but not overpowering, sauce subtle and delicious, bread crispy soft and supportive and not too greasy.  No fingerprints on my phone right now!

It was the kind of sandwich where you dive right in and then all of a sudden it&#39;s gone and you&#39;re like NOOOO WHAT HAPPENED!?

And you console yourself that at least you still have the mixed green and quinoa side salad with the lil tomatoes so you sadly dig into it and OMG IT&#39;S AMAZING TOO WHAT IS THIS ZESTY DRESSING?

And then you finish your latte and wonder if you can stall the check long enough to be able to eat dessert too.

A new Star on my map of LA.

EDIT: I just had the Pollo Crepe it is very good too but not as good as the reuben.  Super stretchy awesome crepe though!"

I have been going here for the past 6 months at the least and needless to say this vegan food is the best i&#39;ve had so far in LA.  

I love the variety of food they have to offer from the delicious breakfast burrito to the undeniably amazing deluxe burger. (both are must tries) 

Also, they have organic coffee which is exceptional. I love the caramel latte, just saying.

There&#39;s wraps, burgers, sandwiches, rolls, savory crepes, sweet crepes, breakfast items, pastas, bowls, to all kinds of Mexican dishes (burritos, tacos, quesadilla, enchiladas, mole stuff, relleno, and more).  

I&#39;ve previously tried the Pesto Chickin Pasta and I remember it being very delicious, satisfying minus the heavy factor. The pasta was generously packed with different green veggies. 

I&#39;ve also tried one of their Taco Specials, the Chorizo Tacos (two tacos for $9.95, add beans and rice for $3 extra) and they were excellent. Everything about the taco was delicious. The fresh soft corn tortilla, salsa, pico de gallo, guacamole and the very flavorful chorizo... loved it! The only downside is the dish is rather pricey. For 2 smaller-than-hand-size tacos, and I have small hands, and a little bit of chips it&#39;s $10. To really make it a satisfying meal, one should add the rice and beans for $3 and that&#39;s $13 for a plate of two tacos with two sides... muy pricey!

They also have a ton of vegan desserts: cakes, truffles, cheesecakes... so many options. 

I really hope the owner Oscar opens a second location soon in the South Bay area like he has previously mentioned. The drive out to this part of LA is such a pain that it really prevents me from enjoying The Grain Cafe as often as I&#39;d like."

Waitress was patient with our order and helped us with the menu. 

Our food took AN HOUR to get to us, and it was barely warm. It wasn&#39;t frozen or cold, but you&#39;d think our food would at least be hot if it took an hour to make.

They accommodated us with guac &amp; chips, 5 minutes before our order came out. We were the only 3 in the whole restaurant...

The food tastes a bit like you would make at home,  but you didn&#39;t have to make it. That&#39;s sort of the whole point,  right? I would eat here more often and give more stars if they had reasonable prices. They have a kids menu with 2 offerings,  a grilled cheese for 8 bucks or a tofu sausage sandwich for 9 bucks.  My kid was in the mood for beans and rice with a little guac. Her meal, beans and rice that fit on a saucer-sized plate and a half cup of guacamole with chips was 15 bucks. I don&#39;t mind paying 12 bucks for my chicken curry wrap, even if it seemed to have barely any chicken salad.  It was probably healthier that way and that&#39;s the price that was listed,  that i consciously decided to pay.

I got the nachos. It wasn&#39;t that great. I&#39;ve had better vegan nachos. They need to put more sauce and the daiya cheese overpowers it tremendously. I don&#39;t know.. Maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;m from Portland and the vegan food there is like spot on. Lol

I having been frequenting Veggie Grill alot, but then i rediscovered this place again. The best  part is that I think most of their ingredients are organic, which Veggie Grill cannot say. I just wish that they might use a service like Grub Hub. They deliver, but the minimum is $20 which is a bit high.

I tried his quesadilla too, and while it was impressive compared to other vegan approximations I&#39;ve had, it still fell short of true cheesiness--tasted and felt a little bit like EZ cheese.  But that&#39;s not enough to ding a full star--I would recommend this even to people who have no interest in veganism, but just want delicious food.  The coffee is good too."

It was around 3pm and my niece and I had just left the LA fitness expo at the convention center so we were opting for something healthy but delicious; wow did this place deliver! The place itself isn&#39;t intimidating at all, I know most people feel that way about vegan restaurants but this one is very welcoming. The parking lot is a bit limited but not to small. We went on a Sunday so the lot was full but someone was leaving as soon as we arrived so parking wasn&#39;t difficult. We walked in and we weren&#39;t sure if to seat ourselves or wait for the waiter so I just grabbed the menus myself and sat on a booth. We were attended right away by our waitress, and she brought out water without us even asking! awesome! I wish I would have gotten her name she was really nice. The menu is not at all confusing to look at, it is very expansive and direct without being a whole chapter book long. I ordered the reuben sandwich with potatoes, and my niece got the club sandwich.

The Reuben: OHHH MAA GODDD. delicious! best sandwich I&#39;ve ever had no doubt. The bread was perfect and the &#34;meat&#34; was cooked perfectly. (I think it was tempeh but I&#39;m not to sure) The potatoes need some work but I was to the point were I didn&#39;t mind because the reuben was so good! 

The Club: awesome as well! It had a very picnic fresh like taste to it. 

Overall just a really gorgeous place, the staff wasn&#39;t rude or to annoying, the food was amazing, and the menu makes you want to order more than one item. I didn&#39;t order dessert but the next time I will! the cakes look very fresh!"

I got the chilaquiles, the waffle, and an order of potatoes. The minimum is 25 so hard for a single person to make but just two people could easily order from here and make the minimum.
The chilaquiles are great! I love the addition of veggies to the dish. It doesn&#39;t deliver as well as when you get it in person, but chilaquiles never do. Not the shop&#39;s fault, just what happens when you put chips with hot and wet sauce in a to go box. It loses crispness, but even then is still super tasty!
The waffle delivers well and has a nice whole grain nutty flavor to it. I like it a lot.
The serving sizes are fair, taste is good, delivery is fast, and it&#39;s nice to have a vegan shop in the area that delivers. It&#39;s also nice to have a breakfast shop that delivers! I&#39;m not a vegan but I&#39;m allergic to eggs so it makes me happy to enjoy breakfast for once!

Boyfriend ordered the waffles plate. They  were delicious, the best thing we ordered.

We shared a tropical crepe which was also very disappointing. Thick, tasteless crepe that arrived to our table soggy. Fruit inside was not fresh and tasted like it had been heated too long, losing its flavor and color. Didn&#39;t finish it.

Parking can be a bit of a pain but they do have valet if you need it. The service here is always a hit or miss and expect to wait awhile if you don&#39;t have a reservation. Time to get down to the food.

Spicy garlic edamame: for a lot of Japanese restaurants this is the best part of the meal because I mean edamame is always good and impossible to mess up. Here the edamame is great but it&#39;s just the beginning. This gets 4 stars.

Corn skewer: OMG OMG OMG this is a solid 5! I always tell people that this is one of my favorite parts of the meal and they never understand until they take the first bite. So buttery! A must get!

Shiitake mushroom skewer: this is also amazing, it&#39;s 5 stars. This is also a must get!

Avocado roll: this gets 4 stars. The taste of this varies on the day I go because it depends on the freshness of the avocado.

Spicy Miso Vegan ramen: this is hands down the best part of the meal!!!! So good! Definitely 5 stars. The texture of the noodles is so good. Soft on the outside but firmer on the inside.

Some of the best ramen and sushi in town. Unfortunately, their customer service is very subpar. If you&#39;re not waiting 20 minutes for your reservation because they over booked,  than you&#39;re getting home only to realize they shorted your take out order. Today, for instance, we called their phones for almost an hour with no response. We had to come into the restaurant to put our &#34;pick up&#34; order in.

This review would be 5 stars, if it wasn&#39;t for the sad birthday dinner experience I had tonight.  After picking up my Mom and boyfriend at LAX Friday night, who were flying in from the bay area after delayed flights, I was nervous about not being able to get to the restaurant in time to celebrate with them.  It was such a special occasion getting to be with them and be able to share my favorite Japanese robata restaurant with them! But we arrived and Parked, with an hour to spare hooray! We told the Hostess that night who was working the front door (Asian but don&#39;t know her name) that we were celebrating my bday and I was super excited about the sparkler bday platter that comes out for the bday person! 

So you can imagine my surprise when after feasting on all the yakitori,  Gindara  (which they messed up my order of), shrimp toast,  rolls, and all this deliciousness - that our server (who was AWESOME btw, Bobby) informed my boyfriend after he inquired..that the Hostess NEVER mentioned to him anything about my birthday and that the kitchen was closed! the server seemed genuinely apologetic but WTH kind of Hostess is that?? how can you forget to mention someone&#39;s birthday?!?? She was busy taking pictures of herself and the staff dressed up in cute halloween constumes that she didn&#39;t even apologize for her epic mistake. It was the day of my actual bday too and I waited an entire yr for that special bday moment... that didn&#39;t happen.  And especially after  enjoying a $200 yakitori meal and the anticipation of the sparkler bday item..it was an epic fail. I tried to shrug it off but somehow I can&#39;t. Overall just sad and the worst birthday dinner experience I&#39;ve had. If you&#39;re going to dine there for a special occasion, make sure to also tell your server, or else it&#39;ll become a clusterf*ck of an experience."

The food, the food were just delicious and unique. These are what we got in the order of what we liked best to the least fave:

Foie gras tacos - Omg! I&#39;ve never had anything like it! The combo of the crispiness of the taco shell and the tenderness of the foie gras plus the sauce is just a winner 
Chicken thigh oyters - have enough crispiness and taste so heavenly
Tonkatsu ramen - so good! the meat is so tender, I&#39;ll be dreaming of this during the winter
Chicken meatballs - sweet &amp; savory and just delish
Shrimp toast - a miniature shrimp sandwich that comes with a mayo-butter dip. we weren&#39;t a big fan. 
Homemade tofu - comes with green onions and bonito flakes for garnish and oyster sauce for taste. we won&#39;t order this again, reminds me of baby food
Chocolate fondant - skip, just so dry and tasteless. maybe the pastry chef was having a terrible day

The dessert let down obviously didn&#39;t affect my rating because our tummies were already happily singing. The service was 4-star, our male server was excellent but we just didn&#39;t like how the other staff would clear our table so fast, they came too often and it&#39;s so interruptive.

Woah. I am not a fan of LA&#39;s ramen but that&#39;s probably because I recently came back from Japan, but this place totally hit the spot. The caramelized onions give it a twist that makes it part Japanese and part Angelian. It works. The broth was so tasty and the noodles were cooked perfectly. The egg was also perfectly cooked. One of my friends detests pork and he loved this place.

N O I S E

The noise level here is extreme even when we were sitting in the outside patio. Noise just carries through here. Everyone was yelling or in loud voices so everyone could hear. It could be due to the fact we were so close to each other. They wouldn&#39;t let us split up a 6 people group so we were squashed at a four person table."

Tip
I recommend calling in and making reservations. The wait time for walk-ins may take up to an hour plus. The restaurant is on the smaller size but everything was well decorated. There&#39;s seating inside with a sushi bar and outdoor patio. 

Food 5/5
I got half bowl spicy vegan ramen and it was AMAZING! I&#39;m in love with the texture of their noodles. I&#39;m definitely coming back for the ramen! Their garlic edamame was mediocre. I wish it had more garlic mixed in. Don&#39;t forget to try their side corn and shiitake mushroom skewers!"

In this huge bowl they pour the liquid tofu in it so that in 5 minutes or so it thickens into silky soft tofu. Magical.
It came with small sides of 4 flavorings which made it really interesting. And the portion is HUGE like I think I ate 4 cups of tofu... it&#39;s healthy, super filling, but I&#39;m surprised I pretty much ate the whole thing but wasn&#39;t bored by it because of the different flavorings.
Also I got egg that you can add to the ramen (about $1) on the side, and the yolk was absolutely gold. So good. Flavored perfectly well with the egg cooked just right. Just as it should be.  

Second timing coming in, had the bento lunch special which is actually a ton of food and a great way to try several of their popular yakis. I really liked the sunomono (seaweed crabmeat salad), chicken thigh oysters, and the grilled okras. But with the yaki and the tempura... it gets pretty heavy. 

Shrimp toast was good too! Perfectly crispy on the outside. 

Minus points for the service--our server who took the order and checked up on us was really attentive and professional, but serviced lacking from some other servers who served us the food who mistakenly gave us the wrong orders. Because the person who took the order and who is serving the food were different... it got pretty complicated. And also even as we came as a group and sat at the sushi bar, the check was a group check and not individually, which could have saved some headaches.

But I mean, other than that I had such a unique, fresh, healthy, super-filling tofu meal, and a bento lunch! Deserves 5 stars."

Now the half bowls of ramen are $7.20 from $6.50. Their bento box went from $11 to now $13. Regardless of all of that, it is STILL worth the price hike.

Along with the prices, the quality went up for me.

Consider this: you can go to Whole Foods and get one of their specialty rolls for $12-$15 or you can go to Robata Jinya&#39;s lunch and have their sushi combo for $15 or their lunch bento for $13. They give you a lot of food and if you are still hungry, well they specialize in Japanese tapas so order a la cart until you are satisfied."

They put some kind of smoky caramelized onion on top that adds an amazing depth of flavor to the soup. The noodles are thin, and have a great texture. The whole affair is fabulous. As a self-professed ramen elitist (not sorry), I loved this version and keep coming back for it.

Oh yeah...and you can get other things:

Shrimp toast: exactly what I would have wanted to eat when I was five years old (partly because it&#39;s deliciously simple, partly because they cut the crusts off the bread, as they should.)

House made tofu: a soft dream. Add all the toppings. Even if you don&#39;t like brick-style tofu, of any kind of tofu, get it. Different and delicious.

Yakitori: My favorites are the eel, the chicken thigh oyster, and the asparagus, but I think that pretty much everything you get will be good.

We didn&#39;t make a reservation and the restaurant got fully-booked until 8:30PM on Wednesday night, so I got seated at the sushi bar which was pretty nice too as you&#39;d get to see the chefs prepare sushi and their robatayaki dishes. They have happy hours from 5:30PM-7:00PM on weekdays and 5:00PM-6:30PM on weekends and it&#39;s for selected items from their regular food menu. The handrolls are delicious and it&#39;s sold at 2 for $5 during the happy hours. Definitely worth every single dollar I spent."

If you are not familiar with 3rd St., it is a foodie mecca that literally, has the best of the best places to dine in!  JINYA lives up to this rows of foodie in the area, where they provide great service, awesome brunch specials especially ramen and even their sushi rolls were quite delicious.  We dined outside their front patio overlooking the street view and it was fantastic.  Their ramens for sure are quite flavorful and I highly suggest you give them a try!!

Until then, Cheers! ~ :p"

I&#39;m a bit of a snob when it comes to tuna done right sushi-wise and this place never disappoints. The servers all work as a team to get you your food out as fast as possible; that&#39;s always a treat to watch in action. It&#39;s a bit pricey and I&#39;d stick with the flagship dishes if you&#39;re a new comer. Tiradito. Shrimp Toast. Home made tofu. Their ramen is pretty good too. I always snag a Vegan-half-bowl before I take off. It does me right. Also, pop off on a little Tuna Avocado for your boy while your there too. It&#39;s delicious. 

Vivian, the host, is an absolute charmer and makes you feel welcome as soon as you enter. I&#39;d make reservations Wed-Sun. It&#39;s hard to get in without one for dinner if you don&#39;t. 

Only problem? It&#39;s a bit too loud. They could turn down the music just a touch.

Other than that, I&#39;d totally recommend this place. Do it."

Your orders are put in as they&#39;re taking it so your food come out fast! I asked for a sauce on the side and it took them forever to bring it, I waited 10 mins for chilly oil and they gave it to the table next to me instead, and I had to ask again by the time it got to me I was done eating. 

I recommend:
Shishito peppers sautéed no flakes! 
LaBrea Roll
Angelic Roll
Black Cod

My biggest issue with this place is the consistency with their service. It&#39;s never consistent. One day it&#39;s super fast and great the next it&#39;s so slow. They have great food though always so fresh and so clean.

Parking is a bit annoying so I recommend you just valet your car. The desert here is good they have a great selection. Food is good ambiance is great prices are fair."

Like other restaurants on Third, both indoor and outdoor seating available as well as valet. There is also a sushi bar inside.

MENU
Large selection of skewers, sushi, tapas and ramen. 

Also, great happy hour menu selection 

SKEWERS -- Comes with three sauces
Okra -- good and sweet

Brussels Sprouts -- my favorite of the three. I love charred. 

Chicken -- good. 

Shrimp Toast -- this is a must try. It&#39;s so F&#39;ing good that I could eat it all day long. A definitely new vice that I will specifically come here for.

Spicy Tonkotsu - Not unbearably spicy, but does the job."

I&#39;ve had this place bookmarked forever. We were nearby at the Grove and it was late on a weekend. The time when you either go straight to the bar to make it for last call or you say fudge and just skip right to the late night eats. When I saw this was still open for just enough time to grab a bowl of ramen, I had to choose this one.

Late night vibes there is awesome music (they played Cicada and Biggie while I was there) and candles on every table. Just my kind of place! Service was good too, but I always expect that of Japanese restaurants.

The menu was huge. It took awhile to order because I wanted half the menu. I could&#39;ve gone with all the veggie skewers but the server recommends the miso cod so we got that, in addition to the small sized ramens. She recommended the black ramen but there were a few good options, including a vegan one. 

The only thing lacking was the drink menu. Would&#39;ve liked a proper sake list but I suppose any place that carries one of my guilty pleasures is good. I&#39;m a sucker for lychee martinis, haha. I&#39;m looking forward to going back soon. Like next week, real soon."

Service was very friendly and prompt; I didn&#39;t have any of the issues that other reviewers did. My server was helpful in suggesting the appropriate amount of food, and he frequently came by to check on us and refill our water. Dishes came out very quickly - I feel like we never had more than a few minutes between dishes.

We got the first omakase option (byakko) as well as a smattering of happy hour dishes (happy hour on Saturday?!?! awesome!!). Surprisingly, we got to try lots of items between the two of us, which I enjoyed.

SO GOOD I&#39;LL GET IT AGAIN NEXT TIME:
-- Spicy tonkotsu ramen (medium spicy level): so flavorful, hearty, and complex. The spiciness made me raise my eyebrows, but it wasn&#39;t overwhelming at all. Noodles were perfectly al dente, and the tender melt-in-your-mouth chashu was excellent.
-- Shrimp bacon skewer: really well-seasoned, and the shrimp was perfectly cooked.

HAPPILY RECOMMEND:
-- Chicken thigh oyster: mm, moist.
-- Tsukune: I liked dipping it in the cilantro sauce for a bit of acidity.
-- Crispy rice with fois gras: smooth and creamy topping, slightly tangy sauce, and crunch from the rice.
-- Shishito peppers: nice char from the grill. Flavorful sauce.
-- Nasu miso (eggplant): eggplant&#39;s texture still weirds me out a little, but I still enjoyed this dish because the sweet and savory miso sauce was so tasty.
-- Scottish salmon truffle: above average fish quality, and I liked the light hint of truffle.
-- White chocolate terrine: the dessert that came with the omakase. Sooo yummy. The only reason I wouldn&#39;t *definitely* order this next time is because I should watch my waistline...

COULD SKIP, BUT STILL GOOD:
-- Shrimp toast: didn&#39;t blow my mind as I expected from the reviews. The toast was really crispy, so that was nice. Flavor was pretty mild.
-- Lycheetini: only $5 at happy hour. Decent amount of booze. Very sweet, but that&#39;s just because lychees are super sweet! True to the flavor of the fruit.
-- Prime beef skewer: if you like beef in all its glory, you might like this. It was a little boring for me - I wanted more flavors added.
-- Edamame: very good but you can get this anywhere.

The place was really busy on Saturday night, so I&#39;m glad we made reservations - I even heard the hostess turn someone away because it was fully booked. I&#39;ll definitely be coming back for more - there are lots of items on the happy hour and regular menus that I am still dying to try! Good thing the 1/2 order of spicy tonkotsu ramen and shrimp bacon aren&#39;t too big - I&#39;ll have lots of room for more =D"

Got lucky and was in time for happy hour and I loved the menu.  I could solely eat off of that and be happy with the selections.  We ordered a couple of things that were NOT on the HH menu, and still our final tab came out pretty cheap for the amount of food we got, how delish it was, and selection.  I would come back here and hopefully for HH again.  The food came out at a nice pace and they came around a couple of times to refill our water/free green tea.  However, since my friend and I drink a lot/fast, towards the end when we had no more food coming out, they didn&#39;t really come back so we had to flag them down.  They do play music on the slightly loud side, tables are a bit close together so you can hear next table&#39;s convo and when you get up to leave, you have to squish thru.  They keep it pretty darkly lit inside.  Patio has heaters and clear plastic curtains/cover but if they had twice as many heaters it would have been warm enough for me to sit out there.  Valet is $8.  We got the below (also see receipt photo)...

HH:

chilean sea bass roll - 4 sushi pieces, with a little salad on top, good dressing and whatever leaves they were, also yum.  the fish is tempura style.  love the salad too, cause it&#39;s healthy and tastes great.

3 skewers for $5 - they have 6 flavors you can choose from - tebasaki (wings), brussell sprouts, tomato?, chicken tenderloins (breast meat?), another veggie, and something else - i took photos of the HH menu so look at it.  :)  i got 1 wing order which comes with 3 wings - no salt or sauce comes with it, and 2 tenderloins - which for some WEIRD @ss reason come with wasabi dotted on it and seaweed.  ???  All the chefs and the GM seemed to be Japanese so not sure where they got that from.  I&#39;m Japanese, FROM Japan, and I&#39;ve never seen or heard of that.  I was fine with seaweed, but scraped off the wasabi cause I only like it on sushi.  Also the breast meat was dry, I should have just ordered all wings.  They gave you dipping sauce for the skewers, but again I had never heard of this and whatever 3 flavors they gave were not very Japanese-y.  So I only ended up using one.  Not sure why this place isn&#39;t like a traditional yakitori place where they ask if you want salt or tare (sauce).  

2 hand rolls for $5 - we got one yellowtail and one spicy tuna.  good!  very traditional/spot on.  

salmon truffle oil sashimi - LOVED THIS.  it came with 4 radish slices and some sprout leaves or something that looked like 4 leaf clovers, but not sure what they are called.  loved the &#34;salad&#34; again cause it made the dish healthier.    

NOT HH menu:

shrimp toast - 8 pieces, good even without the semi sweet/semi spicy mayo type sauce

organic tofu - i love home made tofu, Jonathan Gold recommends it, and I really enjoyed it.  You MUST let it sit for 5 min to form.  Not sure what they are doing/adding to make it table side, which is really them just pouring it out into a bowl.  Gelatin???  I should have asked.

grilled rice ball - anytime I see this on a menu I have to get it cause making it at home takes forever and who has the equipment to make this at home?  soy sauce flavored, crispy on outside, soft on the inside.  yum!  usually takes 15-20 min (it didn&#39;t say that on the menu, but every other place I&#39;ve ordered it from will usually state so)

chicken oyster skewer - which is just chicken thigh, slightly fatty which I LOVE, good size pieces on stick, i think there were 4, no salt or sauce, just grilled, really enjoyed this.  I put sauce on it."

Robata JINYA has been busy every time I&#39;ve gone, but I&#39;ve always had a place to sit without delay. I&#39;d suggest sitting outside if you want to have a conversation with your company, but keep in mind that it&#39;s on a fairly busy street.

Reservations is highly recommended and parking is such a pain - valet is an option! Once seated and fed you&#39;ll forget the traffic and the hassle. But the most important part: excellent service and the food is outstanding!!! It&#39;s a tapa style place, good for small parties and sharing.  

TAPAS PICKS: 
SHRIMP TOAST - best seller item on their menu!!! I can see why. Something so simple yet amazing at the same time. Buttery toast with chopped pieces of buttery shrimp in the middle with their special dipping sauce. The presentation is so cute, they cut the pieces to little blocks and stack them in the serving plate. 

SEAWEED SALAD - typical seaweed salad. 

AGEDASHI - fried shrimp stuffed eggplant and Tofu. This was not a small serving, it came in a large bowl. I didn&#39;t know what to expect but after a few bites i was sold. The infused flavored in the broth and the eggplant, shrimp, and tofu all came well together. It did not have that overly shrimpy flavor I was expecting, everything was subtle and combined well. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. 

CRISPY KALE LOLLIPOP - nothing too exciting about this. Fried kale with a crispy crunch, a sprinkle of salt and splash of lemon. I don&#39;t know what was &#34;lollipop&#34; about it and it was hard to eat since it was so big. Do we eat it with or hands or try to break it down with out utensils (aka chopsticks). It&#39;s good but nothing to rave about since it was just deep fried. RECOMMEND.

SASHIMI/SUSHI PICKS:
YELLOW TAIL TIRADITO - with white ponzu &amp; diced jalapeño. Anything sashimi is practically good. I admit they do drench the sashimi in white ponzu to make it extra delicious but you can still taste the creaminess of the sashimi. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. 

B.S.C. ROLL - backed scallop california roll. Warning, warning... This is very filling. Imagine a crab roll covered with small scallops and a sweet and savory sauce roofing the rolls. They serve came with the plate on fire as part of the presentation (see video). RECOMMEND. 

ROBATA-YAKI PICKS: 
TEBASAKI - chicken wings. Do not expect regular bar like chicken wings. The chicken wing is on. Stick and there are two sticks. The taste of the chicken wing reminds me of a soy marinated bbq&#39;d chicken wing. RECOMMEND.

CHICKEN THIGH OYSTER - comes with three pieces on a stick. They say this is the fattest part of the chicken. Juiciest piece of chicken with a nice crunchy skin layer with a grilled flavor. So bad yet so good. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.

CHASU PORK - comes with two pieces on a stick. Imagine a BBQ pork belly because that&#39;s what it is. 

SHISHITO PEPPER - comes with five skinny pieces on a stick. Eating these vegetables are always risky, it&#39;s like playing Russian Roulette not knowing which ones hot.

JABA APPROVED. Until the next review..."

While ordering a la carte is fine, you&#39;re better off getting one of the omakase selections to get a real spread of what they have to offer.  

They also have a fantastic selection of (slightly overpriced) sake.

robata-jinya-los-angeles,Christine S.,F8BaOhKC-50SB2PcL4Dqnw,"West Hollywood, CA",0,1,1,81,35,j-Q_ZTlkU59swsoiNLCHog,5.0,2016-01-09,"My first experience with Jinya was at their sister Studio City location, where lines were out the door and the wait, at or around 8:30 pm on a Sunday, was roughly 45 minutes, give or take. We didn&#39;t wait but any establishment with such a sight naturally attracts attention. 

Although I&#39;ve tried many places on 3rd street, and I&#39;ve walked past Jinya numerous times, it never clicked until one day, my friend and I entered because she wanted ramen. I then realized this restaurant was associated with the one in Studio City. Moreover, I learned that this location is the only one which takes reservations. So I made reservations through OpenTable. 

Upon entrance, at first, it&#39;s a lot to take in, especially if you observe the various options and dishes on people&#39;s tables. From ramen, to sushi, to barbecued skewers...you name it, they have it. 

After looking through their expansive menu, I was overwhelmed with options, which can&#39;t really be a bad thing. Kind of. In any case, determined to try their ramen, I ordered the small size ($6.80) and then proceeded to order two sushi rolls (albacore with truffle oil and the La Brea roll) with one salmon skewer. 

The sushi came quickly. Both rolls were about $10 with six pieces each. Very tasty with good quality fish. I would not say this lightly or generously! My friend had the beef skewer with Asian sauce and she said it was extremely flavorful - both in the sauce it was dressed in and in the meat. &#34;Explosion of flavor.&#34; I&#39;m down. My salmon skewer was beneath a thick and creamy mushroom sauce. It was good but not something I&#39;d enthusiastically order again, as compared to the other dishes. The vegan ramen was also delicious and extremely rich in onion and garlic flavors. I&#39;m super down with such flavors but be cautious if you&#39;re not! 

Since then, I&#39;ve returned twice for lunch. One time, I ordered a full size of the vegan ramen. The other, I ordered one of their lunch specials (amazing deals!) which was a chirashu bowl, miso soup, and a salad all for $20. The chirashu bowl (see my pictures) featured about ten different kinds of fish, including but not limited to halibut, scallop, uni, salmon, tuna, albacore, and some others I can&#39;t remember. 

Loved my experiences here and appreciate the diversity and versatility of options. See you soon, Jinya!"

The chicken meatballs with the cilantro sauce is a must. The homemade tofu, made at the table is fantastic. Like a savory custard... It&#39;s better than it sounds. You add scallions and other condiments to garnish. It&#39;s really great. The yellowtail sashimi was perfect. 
The fried truffle brussel sprouts might be the greatest thing ever. It&#39;s fried in a light tempura. It&#39;s really, really, really good. 
This place is fantastic. Its cozy, the ambiance is comfortable with beautiful lighting. I&#39;d eat here weekly  if I lived closer. It&#39;s genuinely good."

It has an unassuming front for something that my friend described as &#34;the best lunch in LA,&#34; but after a great meal in their dimly-lit, but friendly restaurant, I could not agree more. We sat at a small table in the corner, and our drink orders were immediately taken. I got a hot green tea, and my friends got iced teas, which they loved. We ordered a bunch of dishes to share as well as a small ramen each. I&#39;m usually a little hesitant to get ramen - it&#39;s pretty savory, lots of food, pretty difficult to eat, and so salty that I usually get dehydrated and a headache afterwards (clearly I&#39;m pickier than most). However, I was SO content with my ramen dish - the small is the perfect amount of food when you&#39;re also getting appetizers, and I honestly consider it better than any of the big-name places, including Silverlake Ramen (don&#39;t sue me). 
For appetizers, we shared the shrimp toast, which are these little shrimp sandwiches that are different than anything I&#39;ve ever ordered at a Asian restaurant, and are absolutely divine. We also ordered the Scottish Salmon Truffle and the Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalepeno. I usually don&#39;t order spicy things (I actually pretty much stay away from them as much as possible), but these were some of the best fish dishes I&#39;ve ever had. I highly recommend Robata JINYA if you&#39;re in the area."

My friends and I love coming to Jinya, and probably dine here about once a week. The staff is friendly and the environment is very nice. The food is absolutely amazing. They make the best vegan ramen out of all the ramen places I&#39;ve been to by far. I also love the lycheetini and the plum wine. I have brought so many people here and they love it too.

This afternoon dined on the following yummies 

Homemade Tofu, $5.80
Scottish Salmon Truffle, $12 
Kubota Sausage
Asparagus, $2.80
Salmon with minced mushroom &amp; truffle oil

The homemade tofu was by far my all time favorite I can eat that every day!

The asparagus was cooked perfect a dash more lemon and sea salt would had been nice. Wish they had the Uni Risotto and Waygu Tartare. Everything was great only thing we didn&#39;t like as much was the Scottish Salmon was served on a ice cold plate was odd and the Salmon skewer could have been cooked less a bit on the dry side. 

The staff was super friendly even for a busy Saturday afternoon. Parking is a challenge be very careful to NOT park on the side streets use valet if you can."

The quick summary to this is: Great place, a bit expensive for me. but a workaround might be their Omakase option for money value! 

Let me start and say that I am the type of guy who wants to leave a restaurant feeling super full. And I cannot do that without spending more than $40 here which is a little bit too much for me considering my mind was not blown (too hard) with the food that I ate. 

THE BEST thing however in my opinion is their sukiyaki skewer. I think its a great rendition of something that i LOVE and grew up eating. The aftertaste is the same!

The hand roll is great. I had the scallops! You can taste a difference in quality and it leaves a great lasting impression.

The shrimp toast is a little overrated. No need to spend $13 on that. I did not enjoy that mostly cause i thought it was too expensive for what I was eating. 

The La Brea Roll is good. I was happy i ordered it but Im not gonna toss and turn at night looking for it you know? 

The Ramen is gonna be a crowd favorite. I think their spicy umami miso is the best in town. Also take note that all the JINYA ramen bars are associated with this restaurant so if you love those, its the same exact ramen! and i love those! 

Staff is nice! really helpful and share good rapport with their customers!"

Robata JINYA is a typical &#34;Monet&#34;...you know: Good from far...but far from good. Here&#39;s the breakdown:

MENU ITEMS
Average to low quality food.  If you are in college, you won&#39;t mind the quality but once you&#39;ve had delicious food, this place won&#39;t be able to compete.  When you grab your table and review the items, everything sounds delicious however tasting the actual food items will leave you disappointed.  I&#39;ve been there more than 10 times and I cannot recommend one dish.  Not one item I crave after sampling the entire menu.  That&#39;s a problem. 

PRICING
Quickly looking at the menu, the items look affordable however once you get your bill, you will be shocked. Those &#34;little&#34; items add up real quick. We ordered a few sushi rolls, a few tapas items, and some appetizers with no alcohol and thought this shouldn&#39;t be more than $40.  Upon reviewing the bill, I was shocked to see it around $70! What a burn!  This place gets expensive real quick.

AMBIANCE
The ambiance is terrific. Very cool looking, on the romantic side and appears to be upscale.  It&#39;s a super casual place where you can roll in with jeans and sneakers or your most fitted European sweater, slacks, and Italian shoes.  Either way you want to dress up, you will feel very comfortable in this restaurant. 

OVERALL 
Do yourself a favor and avoid this place.  It&#39;s not the fun, tasty, affordable neighborhood sushi gem where you can have a few glasses of beer, sake, and good quality sushi.  Unfortunately the search continues to find that perfect destination in this neck of the woods."

I come here all the time and always love it. The robata yaki is great, my favorites are:
- Chicken Meatballs 
- Prime Beef
- Miso Cod
- Okra
- Mushrooms
- Asparagus

Their sushi is also good and I you can&#39;t go wrong with their tapas, I always get the eggplant. The ramen is amazing!! 

The decor is warm and welcoming. The staff is very friendly.  Service can sometimes be slow. 

I will definitely be back!"

Just because they got busy and making $. The food is still pretty solid but you can go to other spots with better service for the quality of food. The wait can get super long so I don&#39;t even bother. This is more of a reservation type restaurant and not a walk in which confuses me because it&#39;s in a area commonly visited by tourist

THE RAMEN IS THE BEST HERE, even though it&#39;s not advertised as their main dish. I honestly think that it is better than Daikokuya, Silverlake Ramen, Santouka, and Orenchi Ramen in Norcal. I always order the Spicy Tonkotsu. I love that they use spicy bean sprouts and the soft-boiled egg is perfect! I also like the fact that they offer a half portion option. I recently tried their skewers, and those were delicious as well! I recommend the Chicken Thigh Oyster and Chilean Sea Bass. 

I won&#39;t stop raving about this restaurant but at the same time I secretly hope that it stays low-key to prevent long lines lol. It truly is a hidden gem. I will definitely stop by Robata JINYA every time I&#39;m in Socal."

Little by little my bias went away and the impactful glaciers greatly affected me in a positive way. 

One of the greatest things they do is a house spice. Some other local ramen spots will use fire oil and while the noodles are good with it I feel it destroys the broth. With the house spice the broth is pushed into greatness and I love this place now. 

The staff here are all amazing as well. Very attentive and polite."

Reservations recommended unless you&#39;re going at weird times like early dinner or late dinner time.

I&#39;m in love with shrimp toast, okra, and ramen

Came here for Valentine&#39;s Day and the service we had in the beginning was a complete !@#$ show. 
Strike #1: My date had made a reservation here over a week in advance but they lost our reservation - boo. We ended up getting placed in the back end of the bar. 
Strike #2: On top of that, we were ignored multiple times trying to get a server&#39;s attention. 

Luckily, the manager took notice of our concerns and quickly stepped in to move us to a better spot at the bar and we were taken care of after that. 

HOWEVER, no tears were shed because the food was redeeming. We ordered...

+  SIgnature Shrimp Toast: GET THIS!! This one was definitely a winner. Supposedly their most popular item and definitely my favorite one too. Buttery/crispy exterior with a nice bed of shrimp inside. It&#39;s stacked up like Jenga pieces and you dip it in their dipping sauce on the side. Yummy.

+ Chicken Thigh Oysters: Also a must-try. My date and I ended up ordering 4 of these (@ $2.80ea!) and they were sooo tender and juicy. 

+ Mixed Sashimi Ceviche: Good flavors and nice presentation, but the food itself was sub-par. I wish it had more fish and also meh-quality sashimi. They threw in a lot of avocado and tomatoes to add more volume to the dish.

+ Homemade Organic Tofu: Very bougie and unique. The server took out a large bowl of steaming liquid tofu for us and poured it into a separate bowl in which it solidifies in. Really cool experience watching it solidify and taste-wise it was very pure and light. 

+ Agedashi Tofu w/ Eggplant: I normally don&#39;t like eggplant but I really liked this! The tofu was very soft and delicate and the sauce was very tasty. Also really nice presentation.

+ Cow Tongue: I&#39;m usually a huge fan of beef tongue (one of my fav kbbq foods) but the way they made this was very different. Beef tongue is supposed to be flavorful and chewy, but the texture tasted more like tripe. Also tasted like it was dipped in soy sauce. Meh--skip.

+ Sea Bass Roll: A-okay. A little bland tasting and wasn&#39;t the sea bass I was expecting. Felt more like a crunch roll. Skip.

They gave us a molten chocolate cake w/ vanilla ice cream on the house at the end. Beautifully presented and a perfect way to cap off a delicious meal. 

The only redeeming factors were the food and the complimentary dessert they gave us at the end to make up for the horrible service in the beginning. Overall I was pretty impressed with many of the food items, but don&#39;t count on this place to keep your reservation for any special occasion."

Went to dinner with my boyfriend on 2/1/2016 we ordered jinya ramen, oyster shooter, sushi salmon, 3 kinds of mushrooms, salmon with mushroom truffle oil, chicken thigh oyster, and bacon wrapped sausage.
The food was tasty and great service. However we both got food poisoning the entire night and day after so we cant go to work!! He had wendy&#39;s for lunch and i had just some cereal and apple at home so it is impossible to get a food poisoning from others elsewhere but here!! I dont know if it happened to anyone and i&#39;m not sure if it because of the salmon or oyster but this is gonna be my first and last time at jinya bye!!"

Some of the dishes were really good, others...not so much. I most definitely want to give Robata JINYA another shot because they have soo many interesting sounding items on their menu, but for now my rating stands at 3-stars. 

Will C. and I decided to split:
- JINYA Tonkotsu Black Ramen (1/2 portion): I like that the broth wasn&#39;t too salty and the soft-boiled egg was excellent, but I wasn&#39;t impressed with the broth&#39;s lack of complexity/depth
- Homemade Organic Tofu: Definitely one of my favorites, it&#39;s the freshest tofu I have ever had and it&#39;s cool to watch the tofu harden
- Shrimp Toast: I was pretty indifferent about this dish. Just tasted like soft Shrimps Chips that you can get from Asian grocery stores
- Sukiyaki Steak: Delicious, the egg on top makes everything taste 10x more luxurious and the meat is beyond tender.

As you can see, it was pretty hit or miss for us, but I really do feel that a second visit will be more promising. Until then!"

The skewers were delicious and so were the accompanying sauces (I liked the green one the best). I wasn&#39;t a big fan of my nigiri sushi being seasoned though. I thought it was too salty and overpowered the fish. Service was great and everything on the menu sounded amazing. I&#39;d like to come back again. 

Random tidbit: I went on a Sunday night at 6 and there were a shitload of kids there. The place isn&#39;t that big so it can get pretty loud. But by the time we left at around 8, it went from like 12 kids to 1."

They have an extensive menu with robata, tapas, noodles, sushi, so you can mix and match. I really wanted to try their combinations, but my friend was not hungry, so we decided to order a la carte. Very glad I did. The place is beautiful, albeit small. In the back, there is an open grill where you can see them prepare tons of their little dishes. It&#39;s kind of like a classy hibachi experience. I sat at the bar in the back, next to the grill. They also have an outdoor space in the front.

1. Fried brussel sprouts: Yummy! Perfectly crispy on the outside. Very flavorful.

2. Ramen Assari: I got the half portion, which is perfect if you&#39;re having many other small dishes. It was very simple, but the ramen had the perfect consistency. The egg and pork in it were delicious. Broth is not too salty or heavy (although it IS tonkotsu, so it&#39;s not a clear broth). 

3. Chicken thigh oyster: Juicy chicken thigh pieces on a skewer, wrapped in bacon I believe. Loved this dish too.

4. Enoki mushrooms: One large bundle of these delicious mushrooms for around $2.50. I love the crunchy texture. 

5. Agedashi tofu with fried eggplant and shrimp: This was an absolutely delightful dish, beautifully presented. The tofu was soft, partially submerged in a sweet soy sauced. The fried eggplant with shrimp was delicious and complemented the tofu well.

6. Sukiyaki beef: With raw egg over this and a side of mild wasabi, I loved this dish. The only thing I would have changed is make the beef hotter to balance out the cold of the egg.

7. Caramel nut ice cream and green tea mochi ice cream: Homemade ice cream was delicious! Perfect way to cap off this meal. 

I really enjoyed everything I have. Of note, this place is BUSY. I highly recommend you make a reservation before you come."

The environment is casual and friendly, yet trendy enough for the location. Their menu has the same kind of balance as well. There is a range of fancier, reasonably pricier options, and then they have a happy hour and ramen menu. We ordered the shrimp toast, their most popular item. The wagyu beef skewer, also on their top ten list, melted in my mouth! It was so good! We also ordered the lamb chop with truffle mushroom sauce, and the truffle albacore cut roll which were delicious. My favorite was the scallop, uni, caviar. It was amazing; I&#39;m still thinking about it! From the happy hour menu we got spicy yellow tail rolls and creamy salmon rolls which were fresh, however, my one tiny complaint was that the seaweed paper was poor quality which made eating the rolls difficult. The shishito peppers with bonito flakes are away a good addition to a meal.
I&#39;d go back to this place and try their ramen and fresh tofu. And I&#39;ll take another order of the scallop, uni, caviar please!

Its a very hip vibe and the food is amazing. Everything that we had just melted in your mouth and was of the highest quality.  Our only beef was that the food came out too fast. Yes, too fast, that it didn&#39;t let us enjoy the dish before the next one came out.  We tried a bunch of things on the menu and really over-ate.. Spicy creamy shrimp tempora was the perfect balance of taste and crispy.  Our favorite was the Seared albacore sashimi but everything was amazing.  Can&#39;t wait to go back.. great experience!"

Originally came here years ago when they first opened with Japanese foodie friends and have been coming since. They&#39;re known for their homemade soft tofu which is made to order table-side. 

Everything is pretty great but what I typically stick to is:
Jinya Tonkotsu Black - rich pork broth, chashu, kikurage, fried onions, seasoned egg, garlic oil. Japanese Style Crispy Fried Chicken &#34;KARAAGE&#34;. Sashimi/Sushi. Done.

They&#39;ve also got a sweet Omakase deal where you get:
6 Skewers + 1/2 portion Ramen for $30 plus...
* Oyster Shooter  * Edamame  * Nasumiso (Miso-Glazed Eggplant)
* An-Nin Tofu (a soft, jellied dessert made of apricot kernel, agar, and sugar)."

The toro sushi was also excellent (but pricey). The rice was slightly warm like sugarfish. 

I recommend sitting at the sushi bar, instant service, get the meats straight off the grill. 

Also, fantastic service."

This place has so much potential because their food is so good! But the service just ruins it both times I came. I came back here for my birthday dinner because the last time I ate here I loved it. 

The server was nice and took our order right when we sat down. We ordered the Waygu tataki, scallops with caviar, couple skewers, shrimp dynamite, chicken karragge, and ramen. 

Everything was good of course but was all courses wrong. They served us the Waygu and scallops first? When I think it&#39;s supposed to be served last since it&#39;s so expensive and cold. My boyfriend asked what&#39;s in the sauce of the scallops and the food runner didn&#39;t even know. So we ate the scallops and asked them to take back the Waygu and save it for last. 

They finally brought out the Waygu tataki and it was so cold and hard. I think the fat hardened and ruined the whole dish because it was in the fridge for so long. We pretty much just sucked it up and ate it.

We even just decided to cancel the ramen and just grab the check. Aw then they brought out a fire thing with a chocolate cake me."

We only ordered the different type of yakitoris that included duck and green onion, chicken tsukune (which are the chicken meatballs), and prime rib &amp; garlic. For appetizer we ordered the shrimp toast and they were all great! 

We got like 2-3 of some of the above because we weren&#39;t full with just eating one of each.  Try to make reservations so that you can sit outdoors instead of inside. Both are great but they have a really nice outdoor patio."

This delicious Japanese skewer restaurant had so much promise, especially given it was recommended to be the next TykeLykes review.  Things were definitely amiss when only one of three appetizers were delivered (after a 20 minutes wait) and it was incorrect.  And our waiter even repeated our order back to us.  Red flag number one.  Then the main dishes were delivered sporadically with one person in our party not getting his until at least 30 minutes after the rest of the table got ours.  His wasn&#39;t even from the kitchen!  That first appetizer hadn&#39;t arrived even then and when we inquired about it, we were asked if we even wanted it anymore.  A good hour+ later and I had to find out what was going on.  Something had to be up.

We swung by anyway, and ended up being seated with little, or in my case, no, wait.

There were 5 people in our party, so we got to try a variety of dishes. Most were decent to good, but not something I&#39;d come out of my way for (it&#39;s a 1 hour drive, and the parking situation here sucks). One standout that might bring me back occasionally is the foie gras on crispy rice. It tastes exactly like you would expect, but it doesn&#39;t stop it from being good. The truffle ramen was also satisfying, but kind of tastes like grown-up mac and cheese with vegetables.

Many of the dishes were small, even by yakitori standards. Other yakitori places I&#39;ve been to will, say, give 4 skewers, while this place gives 2, so you may need to order multiples.

Regarding the sucky parking, after making a couple rounds of the area (lots of signs saying permits required, and the metered parking available at the time was kind of far from the restaurant), I ended up shelling out for $8 valet. The restaurant does validate, which I believe brings it down to $6. However, as I left before the rest of my party, I wasn&#39;t around when the waiter mentioned it."

The sushi was not all that great and seemed too pricy for the quality/quantity. Perhaps the ramen is better? I would suggest making the sushi rolls bigger and tastier/jucier if at all possible.

I had the spicy tonkotsu ramen with the seasoned egg and it was so freaken good! The atmosphere was great, although the place is small, I didn&#39;t feel crowded. The staff was friendly and accommodated our party of 14 perfectly. 

So aside from the delicious ramen, they also have great sushi and lots of other tasty tapas. Definite try one of the their appetizer platters. 

Will come back for more ramen FOR SURE."

This establishment  has the worst management that I&#39;ve experienced in a while. I came here with a few friends for dinner a few nights ago. There were at least 3 empty tables . The hostess insisted the tables were reserved for reservations only and wanted us to sit at the bar. I went on open table and made a reservation that they refused to honor. In this city there are many choices, my recommendation is to go to an establishment that accommodates customers and doesn&#39;t treat you like you are in a Third World Asian country."

This is as good as it gets when it comes to true jap + fusion. The service is fun and upbeat- FAST. The food is always a surprise. This is a great date night. The crowd is yippy for the most part.

I&#39;ve been here now countless times, and I&#39;ve never been disappointed, not a single time! The owners are married and they are just an amazing, good energy people! Which just make the atmosphere even better. The music is fun very loungy/funky. The prices here are perfect and the size of food is always filling. I would seriously recommend almost anything on their menu. By faves for drinks are the lycheetini and the fun hot or cold sake given in a wooden cup-holder they fill it up so u drink from the wooden piece after your sake. Foods - starters; the best is crispy rice with spicy tuna and Brussels sprouts tempura w/ truffle oil. Entrees; THE SKEWERS, everything from chicken to lamb. And the price wow so affordable! Today I&#39;m trying their happy hour crispy fried rice topped with foie gras. I&#39;m super exited to try, as I mentioned above the crispy rice w spicy tuna is my favorite.
Service is excellent, today we were running late and they kept our table even tho it was packed, I love this kind of service! One last thing either sit on the beautiful outside patio or in the sushi bar. Don&#39;t forgot to make reservations as they get very busy, but usually we are lucky to find a table at the sushi bar as its first come first serve. Enjoy"
