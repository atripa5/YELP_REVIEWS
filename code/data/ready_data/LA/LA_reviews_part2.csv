And the prices are stellar!  There&#39;s also a big parking lot that&#39;s easy to navigate, and outdoor covered seating.

The bad: I&#39;m pretty sure the employee working the register tried to steal $10 from me.  The prices weren&#39;t clearly listed on the menu, and my items weren&#39;t entered into a register when I ordered a tostada and a taco or two  at the counter.  I&#39;m white, and it was clear from fact that I was talking to my partner in English that I&#39;m an English speaker. The guy behind the register told me the price in Spanish (&#34;ocho&#34;, or $8.)

I handed him a $20 bill.  He handed me back two dollars.  I got his attention, said &#34;doce, por favor&#34; (12, please), and held up the $2.  He quickly got $10 and gave it to me, without saying anything. 

Perhaps it was an honest mistake; maybe he thought I had given him a $10 instead of a $20. And maybe he didn&#39;t say anything because he didn&#39;t speak English, and didn&#39;t think I would understand him if he spoke Spanish.  Or perhaps the guy was trying to trick a gringa out of $10.  So, be warned: count your change!

That being said: the food was good enough (and for such an awesome value) that I would happily return, in spite of the mix up/attempted petty theft.  But beware of the prices, especially if you don&#39;t speak any Spanish."

He along with his family have been customers since they had their food truck. We ordered our food to go and everything was packaged great. Our order for 5 people was made perfectly and on this rainy Sunday it hit the spot for us all. Next time we go I&#39;m going to try the robalo, which is grilled to perfection ~ it&#39;s only sold on Saturday and Sunday. I highly recommend this restaurant!

Aguachiles are traditionally very spicy and I didn&#39;t even flinch with these. It was like eating raw shrimp with lime juice. My jamaica was perfect and so was my friend&#39;s horchata. The fish and shrimp ceviche was amazing. A jamaica and the aguachiles came out to $17 so that&#39;s kind of pricey and not worth it considering I didn&#39;t get anywhere near full. This morning I noticed I got charged twice so I would probably never go again.  The reason for the four stars is the kind service, the jamaica and the ceviche."

I cant get enough of this spot been a  loyal costumer for years (10yrs to be exact) from its early stages of business (vending truck) to its current location the freshness and taste of seafood is the same.

The shrimp and fish tacos are also really good. Still hungry? I suggest you get an order of shrimp empanadas..

There was no flavor in the water that they mixed the seafood with, the portion was really skimpy for the price they charge, typical cilantro, tomatoes and onions was added. I can do a lot better at home. They should put more effort and love in their food. If you&#39;re going to be in the restaurant business and want to share your favorite recipes with the public you have to have passion for food not just be in the business for the money.

Dudes!!
Omg....
My husband just brought me here for the first time.  He&#39;s been wanting to come for a long time to this location. He frequents the Santa Monica one when he&#39;s in the area. He&#39;s a hardcore foodie... and I.... his apprentice.

This Pizza is so so so FRESH and delicious.
I loved the sausage, and pepperoni. 
Basil was super fresh. Treat yourself.  This is feelgood Pizza.  Thin crust,  so as you comp down, it&#39;s a little less guilty than its thicker crusted doughy kin. 

I dig the vibe.  It&#39;s industrial meets chic meets pizzeria.

10 points for Griffindor."

Chairs at the high top tables were uncomfortable and we asked for a low top table. 
The waiters don`t wear uniform. 8-O So, if you need something and you want to call the waiter you won`t know how the waiters look like. 
Then my friend saw one of the waiters touching the pizza pieces on a plate with his hands. My friend was disgusted because he saw the same guy a minute ago counting money and then he went straight to the station where they receive the food.... and where he touched those pieces. :-[ 
We asked our waiter who that guy is, and the waiter told us he is their manager. Hmm... If the manager doesn`t know that he must wash his hands before touching the food, I have nothing else to say... just leave... 
Then I went to the restroom and noticed that a kitchen worker left the stall and went out of the restroom without washing his hands. I don`t know... he might have gone home or somewhere else, but I hope it wasn`t kitchen."

I always blame myself when my expectations are set too high because of a hype but when they are based on empirical evidence I expect the place to leave up to my expectations. This is a long winded way to arrive at the point of my contention with Pizza Barra. I had a pizza here a few times on occasion and I thought that they were okay, certainly not excitement building. Then, we came for a brunch and it turned out to be really nice even if we had to build our pizza ourselves. The main ingredient that made us fall in love with our brunch dish was the tomato jam on the pizza. It was thick, semi-tangy as tomato sauce ought to be and semi-sweet as a caramelized tomato sauce ought to be. In other words, it was perfect. I was filled with excitement to have my mouth with this deliciousness when we popped in for lunch but lo and behold the tomato jam appeared not as thick bright cherry colored thick paste as before but in onion-laden lumpy mass reminiscent of Trader Joe&#39;s marinara sauce and in taste didn&#39;t seem any different either. So, yah. 
There were other grievances: why a place like this that makes fresh cocktails can squeeze their own orange juice? Why bring 5 slices of bread when offering to bring 1 slice to scoop up the last bit of sauce (yes, my boyfriend is not as picky as me.) if I were the manager of this place I wouldn&#39;t be happy. What restaurants do not understand is that the devil is indeed hides in the details, every little thing counts if you want to have repeat customers."

It&#39;s located next to the arc light, so you can park in the structure and get parties validation at the restaurant. What was great was even though it was a Saturday night, the staff let us really enjoy our meal without interruption and let us chat in between without rushing us for our table.

We started with the chips and house dip, which were delightful and crispy with the right balance of salt. We then moved on to the baked goat cheer with marinara and bread. YUM! The bread was flakey and paired perfect with the herbs and sauce. I could have eaten it all night!  Next we got half avocado pesto and prosciutto and egg. This was the only thing we had that I wasn&#39;t super impressed with. It was good, but a bit dry, and I felt the avocado wasn&#39;t ripe. I didn&#39;t try the other half, but the rest of the table wasn&#39;t super impressed either.

On the way out we grabbed their cookies. They are the size of your face...massive. For $3.95 it was worth it. I got the chocolate chip rice crispy...it was delicious and took me two days to finish.  I would go back here again and get a different pizza choice. But the service was great, and even though with validation I still paid $9 to park, I would give it another shot!"

Very spacious restaurant with a bar area in the middle along with regular dining. There is also a small spot near the entrance that sells baked goods as well as hot drinks. They are know for their pizza which come with normal tomato sauce or white sauce as well as super thin crust or hand-tossed crust. 

I opted for an organic sausage and shaved fennel pizza as well as adding pepperoni and an egg on top for a small extra charge. The pizza came out rather quickly and had a nice crunchy, well baked crust. There was an abundance of toppings and the pizza was definitely more than enough for one person. The flavor was great with a little of spice from the sausage and pepperoni. Really enjoyed this pizza but a little on the pricey end as each pizza is about $15 or more."

Pizza is my favorite food so I was so excited when I moved close to Stella Barra, as I&#39;ve heard good things since moving to LA. 

My boyfriend and I came here for date night. My eyes went right to the mushroom pizza. I wanted to change things up but the server highly recommended it so I went with my usual, mushroom pizza. My boyfriend ordered the cheese. The mushroom was AMAZING and pretty big. You definitely get a good amount of food. The cheese was really good as well. They mention the crust on their menu multiple times and we didn&#39;t really know why. But it&#39;s the most unique pizza crust ever! Crispy on the outside and doughy on the inside. Incredible! 

The pinot grigio was really good and I got a hefty pour. 

The atmosphere is one of my favorite parts. There were so many people hanging out at the bar having a good time. The high top tables aren&#39;t the most comfortable but they didn&#39;t really bother me. My bf just thought the stools were quite small. 

My favorite part about this place could be the bakery. They have so many baked good available for purchase. It&#39;s a counter right by the door and it looks like you can get sandwiches to go as well. How cool! I got the chocolate chip Rice Krispie cookie and it was unreal. 

The reason I took a star off was because of the service. Our server barely said two words to us and took forever to come back to give us the check. I don&#39;t think he was rude, it just seemed like his personality. VERY laid  back."

We started with the burratta and bread with house made tomato jelly. The Brad is baked in house, it&#39;s so good, burratta is cheese ice-cream right, so creamy and delicious. What topped this dish off was the tomato jam, it&#39;s a fine dice of onions and tomatoes which have been caramelized and seasoned with thyme and rosemary and a pepper, not too spicy hough. Great dish. 

The wings were next and these were unlike any other wing dish I have had, I am an avid wing fan and these surprised me in a positive way. They are tossed in a her bed sauce, so good, had to add some salt though. I enjoyed these wings and they took 4 minutes to fry, how crazy, I think they pre-cooked them and store very cold . 

The potato chips were very salty and cold, they were a turn off.. 

The sausage pizza was next and it was phenomenal, the crust was amazing, best pizza I have had in a while. Good flavor, hot, crispy and thin like crust, just awesome. I had most of that, 5 of the 8 slices.

They have great happy hour here! Great pizzas and they don&#39;t skim on their wine pours! 

However, the one thing that really puts Stella Barra on the map is their little unassuming bakery in the front! The apple oatmeal cookie is my absolute favorite cookie. Ever. All cookies are gigantic... Some barely fit in the bag they provide you.  Cookies are baked perfectly.  Crispy on the outside with a soft center.  The apple oatmeal though... I can&#39;t even.  

For all you chocolate lovers out there:  My hubs likes their extremely chocolate cookie. 

We buy extra cookies so we can eat them the next day! Yes! We are obsessed!!

We came here on a Wednesday evening before catching a show at the Pantages a few short blocks away. Even though we sat down at 5:45pm, nearly half the restaurant was full! That&#39;s got to be a good sign - and it was!

Between 4 of us, we shared two salads and two pizzas (though I only tried 1 of each). The spinach and kale salad was pretty delicious. I loved the shaved cheese on it which gave this simple salad a nice salty accent. We also had the Italian chopped salad which I didn&#39;t try because it had pepperoni. It looked good though (eat your colors!) and everyone else seemed to really like it. We had the shaved mushroom pizza and the organic sausage and fennel pizza, the latter of which I also didn&#39;t try since I didn&#39;t know the content of the sausage. The mushroom pizza though...soooo tasty. The crust is thin and really delicious. I think there was a hit of truffle oil in it. 

On our way out, we picked up some cookies from the bakery section near the entrance. I had the chocolate chip with sea salt cookie which wasn&#39;t great at all. The cookies are cold and hard. I would skip these nearly $4 cookies next time. 

This is totally going to be my pre-theater and post-gym destination from now on. There&#39;s a lot more on the menu I want to try!"

Parking can be found around the area, but the best place would be the parking lot near the ArcLight theater. With validation, it costs $3.

Moving onto the food, we came around 11:30am on a Sunday. The weekend brunch menu was out with their drink specials. My coworkers ordered the Bloody Mary and Michaelada. I tried some of the Blood Mary and it was pretty decent! I don&#39;t really like tomato juice, so it wasn&#39;t my favorite. When it came to ordering the food, we just couldn&#39;t decide! There was brunch and then the fresh pizza to choose from, so we decided to do family style and order a lot of items. We tried their brioche french toast and their pepperoni pizza. I literally fell in love with their french toast, it was unlike any other french toast I&#39;ve ever had! So if you do come here for brunch, you have to order the BRIOCHE FRENCH TOAST. It was so soft and sweet, almost melt in your mouth french toast. I didn&#39;t even have to add any syrup because it was so yummy.

Their pizzas were also really amazing, it was awesome seeing the open kitchen with the freshly made dough in jars and the oven. The ingredients tasted so fresh and the crust was perfectly baked. I can&#39;t wait to come back here to try some more of their breakfast items!"

Of the Pizza&#39;s I&#39;ve had here, the Mushroom reigns Iron Chef Supreme. But, even the Rosa and Margherita are solid options too. Get it and you won&#39;t be disappointed as the flavors blend perfectly with the crust. They take so much pride in their crust, that they even give you proper re-heat instructions on their boxes.

This restaurant is literally right next to Arclight, so we parked at the theater parking and walked over to Stella Barra Pizzeria. FYI: Our total stay was a little over 4 hours, and with movie validation, our parking fee total was around $5.00. 

This restaurant has a very open space, and a cozy ambiance. They have bar seating, lounge seating and table seating. We sat at a table and our server was very prompt to assist us with our orders. 

We ordered a bottle of Pinot Grigio (sorry forgot the name!) between the two of us. It was a perfect complimentary wine to go with what we ordered. The wine had a nice, crisp touch, and we didn&#39;t get too sick of it by the bottom of the bottle. 4/5

For starters, we ordered the meatballs. omg possibly the best meatballs I&#39;ve had in a while. They are so soft, it cuts right through with your fork. And the marinara sauce and cheese ratio is NOM. They give you 3 meatballs in one order. 5/5

Since we weren&#39;t that hungry, we ordered 1 pizza and shared. We got the Margherita pizza, which is pretty basic and added the sunny-side up egg for 2.50 extra. We got this in their roman-style extra thin pizza. The pizza wasn&#39;t too big, but it was very yummy. 5/5

Their pizza is definitely on the pricey side, but I would definitely return to try their other items. I would recommend this restaurant to a friend."

I was attending a special screening of  movie next door so I had done my research before leaving home. I had such high expectations of everything on the menu based on prior reviews and photos.  I don&#39;t know what happened because I didn&#39;t love it. My mouth mush be broken.

The baked goods are what you first see as you come in. I totally wanted to just eat a chocolate chip and bacon cookie for dinner. It looked so good. Well, I didn&#39;t do that, but I did take a regular chocolate chip to go as was suggested by our waiter. It was so weird because the cookie didn&#39;t taste like anything. It was seriously like a yummy looking sugary disc. There was no distinct chocolate taste or even vanilla. I made my husband tasty and he thought it tasted like molasses. Well even if that was the flavor it&#39;s not the best. I ate half of it only because I really wanted it to taste like something. The dark chocolate chips didn&#39;t taste any different than the cookie dough. Such a disappointment. 

My pizza was okay. I certainly wouldn&#39;t run here to try it again. My husband liked his but he has ordered a half sausage, half pepperoni so that probably was yummy. I wi say that I enjoyed my crust but it wasn&#39;t the best I&#39;ve ever had. I had a half bacon and goat cheese and a half some other meat. It wasn&#39;t prosciutto. I don&#39;t know. It was a special. The bacon was sweet or maybe it was the red sauce. I didn&#39;t hate it, but it wasn&#39;t what my mouth was expecting. The other pizza had three cheeses that were overpowering to the meat topping. They were funky, stinky cheeses. 

I also was excited about the chips with blue cheese dip. Once again. Not fantastic. The dip once again had no flavor. I scooped the blue cheese pieces out with my fork trying to get some flavor. It didn&#39;t work."

The service is a hit or miss - I&#39;ve been here many times and sometimes we feel like we&#39;re being ignored and sometimes my water glass gets filled every time I take a sip.  Oh yeah... some of the hostesses at the front also seem annoyed when we check in... but keep making the pizza delicious and leave it at my table and I won&#39;t care!

So, like Titus Andromedon recommends, grab a glass of pinot noir and share a couple of yummy slices with friends.  PS.  sit in the front section with the couches/arm chairs if you can

ENJOY!"

I honestly think the pizza is over-rated, I wasn&#39;t impressed with the soggy pizza dough in the middle of the pie. It was slimy, and as soon as I picked up a piece, it fell apart."

First off, when you step into the restaurant, the room is very spacious -- open space, with plenty of seating. We were seated and proceeded to order:

(1) Pancetta &amp; three cheeses pizza (to share) - thin pizza, with great flavoring but very oily. I had to blot out the oil from the top of the pizza because the pancetta was oozing out grease. It was very good though, especially when you sprinkle pepper flakes on it. This was shared between my husband and me.
(2) Adobi chicken wings with blue cheese dip - mild chili oil was used, there were 3 drumsticks and 3 wings. the dipping sauce was the highlight - a variation on the blue cheese dip.

Overall, we thought this place offered some great tasting pizza. We wouldn&#39;t mind coming back again in the future to try another pizza style or variation.

Parking on the streets for $1 per hour, or $3 for 2 hours in the parking structure next to the restaurant."

Pizza was good, as always. Chewy crust, crispy on the bottom. I want to get the Margherita or Rossa next time. My stomach could not handle our Cheese pizza with the fresh mozzarella and Parmesan, as good as it was.

Service was good at the bar, from the cute husband and wife team. We ended up there after a not so welcoming reception from the hostess. Which is fine because sometimes I prefer eating at the bar. Makes for a more intimate experience with the restaurant staff.

This will definitely be a regular spot and I&#39;ll continue to recommend this place."

I work in the service industry so I know what can be done. We always have to ask for waters. Food is seldom served as asked for. We stopped asking for appetizer first and then entrees because they never come out that way and it&#39;s always blamed on the kitchen. Sorry chefs. But it&#39;s&#34; never&#34; the servers fault apparently. Lol. Now we ask for one item at a time so we can finish and then Start our entree. Food is delicious and the only reason we come back. Burrata and tomato jam is a must try. Along with pizza and chips.

I need to come back here more often. Every time I&#39;ve been here, typically before movie, I think &#34;this place is cool&#34;. It&#39;s cozy, it looks cool, and the pizzas are great. I get the pepperoni hold the pepperoni. I know, sounds like a cheese pizza but it&#39;s not.

The only thing that might improve is maybe the young bartender&#39;s personal skills. She was very nice but I think she would do the restaurant a service if she was more focused on listening to her customers then just talking to them. when it&#39;s a slow night, that&#39;s how you make your money. I get it, it&#39;s Los Angeles and everyone wants to talk about their career but as a customer, I guess I want to do more of the talking.

Finally came here for dinner, got the cookie, and it was everything I imagined and more. Gooey, soft, chocolatey and larger than life. 

We also ordered the Margarita pizza, which usually comes fresh mozzarella and fresh basil.  This one was just cheese pizza.  While, based on the ingredients is very similar; in reality they are pretty different.  Here, it was just a cheese pizza.  So they either brought us the wrong pizza or they don&#39;t know how to make Margarita pizza.  Still, the pizza had delicious thin crust, fresh ingredients, and was very tasty.

Tried Stella Barra after driving pass so many times and smelling the scent of the pizza&#39;s in the air. Checked out the menu and saw a goat cheese and bacon pizza that peaked my curiosity but the ending result was well...just ok. I could barely taste the bacon. However the goat cheese was their and was a bit overpowering. Had both the bacon and goat cheese balanced, it might have been better.

The service is decent enough and the beer selection is good as well. I&#39;d pay another visit but to try other items on the menu besides pizza. Not going to knock all of their pizza&#39;s but the one I chose wasn&#39;t too impressive. The pork sausage a friend ordered was decent which proves a regular classic is sometimes the best choice.

Got a margarita pizza with prosciutto, and not only was there almost no cheese, but there was barely any sauce... And the crust is HUGE so you&#39;re basically eating bread and prosciutto. 

When I asked for a side of sauce they said its extra because they &#34;make it in-house.&#34; -- Oh really? A f*****g pizza place makes their own sauce and that&#39;s why it should be extra for more? 

Also got a kale salad with dates - it looked like the chef took a fist-full of kale, threw it in a bowl, and tossed it over the counter to the waitress. Also barely any dressing so it tasted like I was just eating raw kale. 

Service: We ordered the pizza, salad, and an iced tea. The waitress repeated everything incorrectly, dropped off the iced tea without a little sugar box so I had to get up and grab it myself. Same with extra plates, the sauce, and check (the place was half full, this was not due to a packed house). 

Bottom line: I&#39;m VERY forgiving when it comes to service if it&#39;s a full house OR if the food is GOOD. Neither of these were the case.

Good atmosphere.  Not inexpensive.    

Moscow Mule = yum!

Margherita pizza = pretty yummy... good crust.  8 slices, big enough to share.  Kinda wimpy though... very thin bread and not much cheese/sauce on top.  Wimpy limpy pizza but the taste is there.  Also they stuck big basil leaves on only every other slice... not a fan of that.

Caesar salad = different than your usual caesar salad since it has arugula and brussel sprouts but that&#39;s why I chose it.  I wanted a different take.  I enjoyed it.

Chicken Wings = meh... the herbs were a bit overpowering.  I could do without these again.  My friend really liked them though so... ?!!?

Husband&#39;s go to place when we see a movie at arclight. 

The awesome:

***The thin crust prosciutto and egg pizza is so SOOOOO GOOD. Ugh I&#39;m not even hungry right now but I want that in my mouth. I will say it is SPICY. I love a little red pepper, but people with sensitive palates should ask for it without. 

***The garlic bread. A little oily sometimes, but usually pretty delicious.

***burrata appetizer. If your not a cheese person, this might turn you.

***Their cocktail with Jameson and Goose IPA, when done right, is delicious. The first time I had this, I couldn&#39;t imagine my life without beer cocktails. I had it a second time, and the bartender put way too much syrup.

***the decor!! So modern and sleek, I love it.

***gingersnap cookie. DO IT.

The &#34;Meh&#34;:

***don&#39;t sit at the bar if you can avoid it. We got stuck here, and the bartenders were of course super busy, and we&#39;re doing everything they could to avoid the extra task of ordering food for us. And we definitely got splash-back haha.

***reservations and time to wait for a table! Here&#39;s a secret: when they say it will take 45 minutes for a table...just go on open table and reserve one. We did that and reserved one easily for ten minutes after the time we were told we had to wait 45. So weird. I can&#39;t explain why, so just take my advice!

Brussels Sprouts which were amazing!  Crispy yet tender and so flavorful! 
Special pizza - Apple Pistachio Pizza with Gorgonzola  - sweet, salty, creamy and just plain decadent!  It&#39;s a good thing the slices are small and thin so it doesn&#39;t feel as sinful.
Rossa Pizza - it comes with arugula which pairs so well with the sweet basil and cherry tomatoes

As a crust eater, this is the most important to me and Stella Barra has it on lock! They tout a &#34;handcrafted dough using locally milled flour, filtered water, sea salt and fresh yeast that creates a crisp crust, chewy center and unique artisan flavor&#34; Yes. Yes and more Yes! 

I&#39;ve been to this location various times - from pre-Palladium gaming or date night. Their menu has most recently pivoted a little bit to feature more veggies &amp; small bites but WINNERS are consistently: 
*Local Burrata - Tomato Jam/House Bread/ Olive oil - while the Santa Monica location has roasted grapes...this tomato jam is an amazing sweet &amp; savory combo of rich tomato-y goodness
*Heirloom Spinach &amp; Purple Kale (w/ Radish &amp; Dates) - this is where I first discovered purple kale. A visually beautiful dish but perfecting pairing of textures as well as balance with the tangy vinaigrette w the sweet dates. This is really one of my favorite salads EVER. 

PIZZAS: The Prosciutto &amp; Egg is my favorite of all time BUT I can&#39;t resist the aroma of truffle from the Shaved Mushroom Pizza (gruyere, melted onion &amp; truffle). So, why choose? If they&#39;re from the same section (White or Red), you can get half &amp; half! 

My friends swear by the Butternut Squash Pizza (taleggio, candied bacon, chilies). This one is good but it errs more on the sweet side for me and I prefer more savory. 

Most recently, I tried the house made organic poor sausage (mozzarella/fennel pollen) and it packed just as much deliciousness as the other pizzas. 

They validate for the structure."

I went here for dinner with a group of friends on Thursday night and we ordered the following:

- Fresh Burratta (3.5 stars): burratta and bread were good; tomato jam was a different and interesting addition

- Cauliflower Hummus (2 stars): overall everyone felt the hummus was pretty tasteless as there wasn&#39;t much seasoning in it; passable when you added pesto to the mix, which they did not give you nearly enough of!

- Italian Chopped Salad (3 stars): good but not so good that I would come back just for this 

- Rossa Pizza -- w/cheese added and thin crust (4 stars): very tasty but super thin, so not enough to fill you up

- Shaved Mushroom &amp; Margherita Pizza -- half &amp; half w/regular crust (4): we couldn&#39;t decide which pizza to choose as our final item, so we went half and half at the waiter&#39;s suggestion; both were delicious!

We were thrilled with everything we ordered: moscow mules, mushroom pizza, brussel sprouts, wings (extra well done), cookie &amp; ice cream. The warm cookie was AMAZING. Really though, everything was fantastic! I will definitely be back."

Made reservations same day through open table, got to the restaurant, and was seated immediately. Stella was a full house, but was well staffed with enough people to accommodate the large crowd. Our waitress was sweet and made a bunch of great suggestions that we loved. Ordered a few of their specialty cocktails which were delicious, refreshing, and well presented. Also ordered an Italian chopped salad, dressed in a light shallot vinaigrette and the Hobbs pepperoni with sausage and arugula added on. The salad was simple, yet so tasty; the garbanzo beans and salami were just a delicious flavor combo. The pizza was superb. I am not one to enjoy pizza crust, but the crust was crisp, flavorful, and simply amazing. The arugula added a perfect kick with the saltiness of the meats.

The ambience in the restaurant was trendy yet very comfy. The open kitchen was fantastic because you can see and smell all the yummy pizzas cooking away. There were both table and couch seating as well as bar area seating right in the center of the restaurant. The crowd was very versatile and the vibe was a perfect mix of la trend and homey. I will absolutely be back again for another slice! Great spot for date night or a casual outing."

Good things first: the spinach and kale salad was fresh and perfectly seasoned. Loved the shaved pecorino and radish, as well as the date pieces (although there may have been a few too many of those). The pizza size was just right. The pizza crust was delicious, the perfect balance between thin, tasty and crunchy. I chose the cheese pizza (mozzarella and parmesan) and it was very flavorful, topped with fragrant basil leaves and chili flakes. My only regret is that the cheese part was a tiny bit dry. Next time I&#39;d try the plain margarita to see if it was juicier.
Finally I really liked the venue - high ceilings, high tables, good lighting, warmth despite the room&#39;s size - and ambiance. It was vibrant even at 10pm on a Sunday night.

Caveats: service although friendly and well-intentioned was a bit haphazard. The waitress forgot our starter (the salad) but had a quick recovery when she offered to bring it with the mains, on the house. Very cool but a shame because we would have preferred to enjoy the salad separately from the pizzas. Also, one pizza arrived a good 5min before the other - it&#39;s always nicer to start eating together. Finally when she asked whether I&#39;d like another round of my cocktail and I asked for a glass of Pinot Grigio, said glass never materialized (mercifully not on the bill either). All those little things downgraded our meal from perfect to good only. But I&#39;d definitely return!"

I&#39;m not a big pizza fan but this place has really good pizza. The squash pizza was my favorites.  Salads are good, and the service is excellent...cannot get better.

First, if you are walking to the movie from either the street or the parking lot there&#39;s N abundance of signage advertising delicious looking food right in front of the theatre. No where is It explained where the restaurant is. We walked around lost and confused for several minutes before some theatre employee took pity on us and sent us in the right direction. 

One safely ensconced in our seats we were greeted by our, mostly, apathetic waiter. I don&#39;t blame him, this is right in the heart of tourist land. He was adequate, but despite asking for it we never received water. Boo. 

Onto te most important part! The food!
We stated with the meatballs. They were, fine. Should have been priced at like $8 not $12. There were three big ones, with plants of fennel and a little fresh basil. The texture was a little... Off? Like I kept expecting to have a bit or grit or cartilage interrupt my chew. 

For our salad we had the kale and spinach salad with pecorino and dates. First there was barely any pecorino but the dates were delicious. My main complaint was the whole thing was bland. It needed an acid to brighten and contrast the flavours of the other ingredients. Overall the salad was bland and muddled. 

Finally, the pizza. We had the most bizarre experience with this. We ordered the rosa with cheese and prosciutto. Let&#39;s start with the good news. 

The crust was the best texture we have experienced since moving to LA. Crunchy, yet chewy. A little bready like a baguette but not too much. Favorite part of the pizza by far, even if it was under seasoned. 

Sauce. Was it canned? I don&#39;t know but there was something.... Weird, off putting and just not right. 

Toppings. First. That was not prosciutto. Not by a long shot. Maybe it was spec? Or bologna? Or mortadella? Wrong texture, wrong thickness, wrong taste. All wrong. And for $5 extra. NOPE. all the other toppings were delicious compared to this. 

Finally, the first bite of pizza was always waaaaaay too salty. Like all the salt that should have been in the crust was in the middle. Not good. 

Overall is a convenient (once you find it) location to the movies that&#39;s overpriced for subpar quality."

Overall the vibe inside is trendy - has a hipster vibe, cushy couches to sit and chat or nice tables for the actual sit down meal. They usually don&#39;t have too crazy of a wait, but the restaurant is always busy. Usually walk here, since I park around the area, but I do believe they validate for parking at the lot closest to them. 

I recommend the brussel sprouts appetizer - super crunchy and flavorful and a decent sized portion to share for two or three. Their chopped salad is also a favorite of mine. 

Not a huge fan of their mushroom white pizza, which was which was extremely heavy for someone who really does love mushrooms and truffle flavors. I think it was the combination of parmesan sauce, mushrooms, AND truffle oils which made this pizza just a little too much for me. However, they do have plenty of other options which are great, I recommend the red sauce sausage pizza. Pizzas (good to share for two) are anywhere from $11-15.

In total for one appetizer, one salad, one pizza and a drink, it only came out to about $45. Great price for the flavor and experience."

Given its location, it could find itself far-more pretentious, but it&#39;s not.  My friend and I sat at a high-top table, enjoyed some cocktails and appetizers, and split a pizza.  The food was great.  Their featured cocktails aren&#39;t the cheapest, but they&#39;ve got some interesting creations, so at least one is worth a try.  Pretty extensive beer and wine options, many of which are truly reasonably-priced.  

The second time, I was meeting a friend at the ArcLight, and decided to avoid rush hour.  So I came in for visit #2.  I was a lone diner with a stack of comics (yes, I am one of /those/ people).  I ordered a drink and appetizer, and the server could not have been nicer.  She even asked me if the table I was seated at had sufficient light for me to read.  

I highly suggest Stella Barra for pre- or post-movie eats and drinks."

I asked the girl behind that counter if we should seat ourselves and she replied that a host would be up soon to help us. The host came quickly and asked us if we had reservations. We said no and he took us to a table all the way In the back next to a hallway. My bf didn&#39;t want to sit there and asked if we could change tables. We had passed at least 15 open tables and multiple spots at the bar get to our original table. The host replied that we couldn&#39;t change tables since we didn&#39;t have a reservation.

Italian chopped salad is one of the best chopped salads I&#39;ve ever had and it pairs so well with their pizzas.

The atmosphere is super chill too. Open kitchens are my absolute favorite. With large lounge sofas to relax and have drinks while you wait for your food.

Their cocktails at the bar never disappoint.

Gorgeous, intimate environment in the evening with a fun yet eclectic soundtrack (props for playing The Knife).

Worthwhile to order a hand-crafted cocktail. I chose The Roots (bulleit rye, hibiscus, sweet vermouth), which came with an orange floating in the glass and tasted delicious.

We shared the House-Cured Pancetta (Red Pizza) and Prosciutto &amp; Egg (White Pizza), both delicious! I&#39;ve never had egg on pizza, so my mind was blown eating it as well as cutting a slice for myself only to find the perfect amount of run. Keep in mind, this one&#39;s spicy! I would not recommend eating leftovers of the egg pizza cold, however, although the pancetta was amazing in the morning!

Size (for those wondering how much to order): 12-inch pizzas, of which I personally ate 5/8 in the restaurant. Being so teeny, I was surprised I was able to eat more than half at once! The crust is relatively thin. Order a pie per person, unless you plan to have starters and salads as well. (I didn&#39;t have one, but the cookies are way more gigantic than they seem in the pictures!)

The only downside: The crust was sort of hard to chew and a little burnt, unfortunately, although I&#39;m sure it varies night-to-night and chef-to-chef."

The service was quick and friendly and knowledgeable. The beers were cold. We ordered the following pizzas:

Prosciutto and egg pizza- I love prosciutto and I love eggs, so it made sense to order this pizza. It did not disappoint. It was my favorite of all the pizzas that we ordered. 

Shaved mushroom- Don&#39;t be surprised about how strong the mushroom smell and flavor is of this pizza. If you are a mushroom lover, which I am, this pizza is on point.

I love the atmosphere of this restaurant! Giving off an industrial-hipster vibe, this place has everything from light bulbs sporadically hung from the ceiling to giant windows lined with herbs growing in mason jars. Seating ranges from individual bar tables, regular tables, couches, or communal seating. The bakery area is also really cute! They even draw on the windows, so that passersby on the sidewalk can get a glimpse of featured items for the day!

Service:  
From the hostess to our server, everyone was really warm and welcoming. Since it was our first time there, our server was more than happy to break down the menu for us and provide some great recommendations. He gave us plenty of time to look over the menu (we&#39;re an indecisive bunch), and we never felt rushed. The staff here really takes care of you.

Food:
- Italian Chopped Salad - Iceberg and romaine with radicchio, tomatoes, chickpeas, salumi, basil, mozzarella, tossed in an Italian vinaigrette...was not impressed with this.
- Shaved Mushroom White Pizza - Gruyere, onions, black truffle, parsley, rosemary, thyme. Yum! This pizza definitely made up for the disappointing salad! The crust was soft and not too chewy. Pizza toppings were delicious, and let&#39;s be honest, truffle oil makes everything taste amazing.
- Chocolate Chip Rice Krispie Cookie - Perfect way to end a delicious meal. Our server even asked if we wanted it warmed, and of course, we said yes!  Warm, chocolately, gooey goodness.

Overall, I liked this restaurant a lot! Definitely come here for the pizza and bakery items!...the salads, not so much. I think next time I&#39;ll opt for an appetizer like the burrata that many Yelpers seem to be raving about!"
stella-barra-pizzeria-los-angeles,Mark V.,Hv3vaKQGK71sLei7hQs9og,"Los Angeles, CA",1,1,1,284,21,zLiowgGDhZZYWzv3Qze_JQ,5.0,2014-06-14,"As I&#39;m sure their &#34;stellar&#34; Yelp average suggests (sorry, I couldn&#39;t resist) Stella Barra elevates the game when it comes to artisanal &#34;grown-up&#34; pizzas. 

After catching a movie at the nearby Cinerama Dome, the GF and I dropped in at Stella and were immediately impressed by the trendy, yet laid-back environment; dim lighting and trendy music (house remixes to Passion Pit, some Friendly Fires, etc.) helped set the mood - one that&#39;s driven home by the restaurant&#39;s contemporary, inviting look. 

Upon being seated - we didn&#39;t have to wait for a table at all! - we helped ourselves to some of Stella&#39;s drink offerings. The restaurant&#39;s draft beer selections consist of much more than the standard Coors and Bud Light found at more traditional pizza joints (although you probably expected that!) Being more partial to lighter beers myself, I went with an Allagash White, which went well with the variety of dishes that my girlfriend and I decided on. 

Speaking of which..

Priced at between $14-17 each, and boasting a number of gourmet topping combinations, the pizzas at Stella Barra are organized under the dual categories of &#34;Red&#34; and &#34;White&#34; according to their respective sauces. Being that we wanted to sample a little bit of both worlds, the lady and I ultimately decided on two whole pizzas:

First up was the Applewood Smoked Bacon &amp; Goat Cheese: 

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/stella-barra-pizzeria-los-angeles?select=Dyx5z45MWIfHrWH11pjDaA#L6B6Ox9t3jnwNYbzk5oYfA

In addition to living up to the hyped up airy-yet-chewy crust that Stella Barra takes such great pride in, the pizza&#39;s ingredients had much to offer, as well. The creamy, locally-sourced goat cheese and crisp bacon melded well with the pizza&#39;s delectable crust, and the charred tomato oil drizzled on top gave the overall pizza a distinct flavor. 

The second pizza that was brought out to us was the Prosciutto &amp; Farm Egg, which in my opinion was the absolute star of the show:

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/stella-barra-pizzeria-los-angeles?select=Dyx5z45MWIfHrWH11pjDaA#OGSlyzWkPJ1lw2_m4FtsFg

Amid layers of chewy mozzarella &amp; gruyere and thin slices of prosciutto was a single sunny-side up egg, served slightly runny (so as to be used as a sort of dipping sauce for the individual pizza slices). All my fellow Filipinos out there can relate to the simple joy of dipping bits of food into runny egg yolk - but for those not accustomed to the idea, I promise that the mildness of the egg and the salty (though not overwhelmingly so!) prosciutto go hand-in-hand with one another.

On other visits to Stella, my girlfriend and I have indulged in some of the pizzeria&#39;s other selections, including the fantastic Burrata appetizer:

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/stella-barra-pizzeria-los-angeles?select=Dyx5z45MWIfHrWH11pjDaA#wICAVe46ZiaXxXI09u5BLw

Accompanied by a side of tomato jam, the creamy burrata is served alongside slides of rustic-style homemade bread; it&#39;s important to note that additional bread can be asked for - as one serving generally isn&#39;t enough to accompany a lone order of this delicious side dish.

Also worthy of mention is the Butternut Squash Gnocchi:

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/stella-barra-pizzeria-los-angeles?select=Dyx5z45MWIfHrWH11pjDaA#bxaAZQ3bECtRSJRIqdYKAQ

Although somewhat lacking in portion size, the gnocchi has a wonderful contrast of crispy and creamy textures (it has a bit of a char to it) that goes well with the savory butternut squash puree with which the dish is served. Again, one order probably won&#39;t be enough to make two people happy. 

Food aside, Stella Barra really distinguishes itself from the pack (in my book) thanks to the employees&#39; shared emphasis on going the extra mile for diners. During our first visit (when I suppose the restaurant was still working out some kinks), my girlfriend and I ordered two pizzas and some side dishes - yet were only delivered a single pizza and the sides within the span of a half hour (and the restaurant wasn&#39;t particularly busy/filled). After expressing our concern to the waitstaff, we were given an order of the house Chopped Salad, free of charge. Even better, our original order of the Prosciutto &amp; Farm Egg Pizza was boxed up for us to-go, also completely for free. 

After picking my jaw up off of the floor, I knew that we had hit the jackpot on a dinner destination that night. As I&#39;m sure you can tell, I will most definitely be frequenting this wonderful pizza spot well into the future."

We were on a time constant and the server was SUPER helpful in getting our food and drinks to us in a speedy fashion. I highly recommend the baked goat cheese appetizer... It was soooo good!! And the bread was so warm and soft and delicious! The pizza crust was incredible as were all of the toppings we got. And you have to take advantage of their desserts at Sella Barra too! They have tons of HUGE cookies as well as rice crispie bars. Big enough to share for sure. Great vibe and great food!

I have come here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and all three all great here. The blueberry muffin is the best blueberry muffin I&#39;ve tasted. So good. The applewood bacon and goat cheese pizza is my favorite pizza that they have, and their meatballs are delicious and something to eat when you aren&#39;t too hungry. And I think everyone knows how amazing their desserts are. The apple oatmeal cookie and the fleur de sel chocolate chip cookie are my favorite. If they&#39;re busy, they will run out of cookies  before the end of the night so grab one while you can. Plus the service is always great.

If you are looking for something quick, don&#39;t come here. Their food takes some time, but it&#39;s worth it. If you get a pizza, it will take at least 20 minutes. So order some drinks and hang out."

We had the burrata and ended up ordering two of them because we liked it so much. We also had the meatballs and prociutto and egg pizza. The pizza was actually a bit disappointing. We were hoping for more than one egg and that it would be runny but it was soft boiled, nearing a hard boil in some areas of the egg.

We finished the night off with their brown butter rice krispy treat and a salted chocolate chip cookie. Both of which were excellent! I would go here again, but I would definitely get a different pizza next time."

They also give warm pita bread and a plate of various fresh items (shredded carrots, beets, red cabbage salad, chick peas). I usually get the plate with grilled veggies (grilled onion, two grilled tomato slices, two grilled red pepper slices).

I tried their baklava, but it was a little on the very sweet side for my liking.

It&#39;s a bit on the pricer side, but they have great quality meats and produce. They have a nice dining area. Street parking or lot parking close by. I recommend this place!"

I strongly recommend the pargiot . they are soft and perfectly cooked. the sawarma can be better both in flavor and not to be over cooked. the lafa bread seems home made so you can&#39;t go wrong with that.

Then you will love Shefa on Melrose. You have great selections from vegetarian dishes to meat dishes. 

If you love Falafel to chicken schnitzel you are in for a real treat. The shawarma is a must if you love shawarma. You have numerous great salads to select from. The minute you walk you order from the cashier.

After you are seated a complimentary vegetarian dish comes to your table with your drink order. The portions are very large size. I highly recommend the chicken schnitzel that was outstanding. The hummus is excellent with tahini. If you are craving lava bread or pita you will love every bite.

The customer service from the minute you arrive to the minute you leave. No questions the food is done with excellent seasoning. If you eat kosher or not kosher you will enjoy your meal.

You have meter parking and side street parking. Make sure you read the signs. As some streets have have parking permit requirements."

It&#39;s like being in a small caf√© in Haifa yet your on Melrose in LA. It&#39;s a little family owned and operated Mediterranean place serving up some legit Kosher goodies.

I love my Hummus and Laffa Shefa does them right. The Hummus was velvety and smooth with a great depth of flavor and bountiful. The Laffa is addicting fresh made dough slammed into the walls of the tandoori oven and cooked in about (30) seconds is nirvana. 

The Shawarma was moist and bursting with flavor. They serve all the meals with a boatload of condiments and little goodies to play the mad scientist of flavor profiles with have fun and experiment. A nice touch and welcomed addition. The food is fresh and made with a deft touch not to mention big portions. 

The space is small with some tables to eat in but mostly a grab and go spot. Service is friendly and straightforward the food isn&#39;t. It&#39;s dialed up and a very good option for Mediterranean especially kosher if that&#39;s how you roll. Shefa means get your kosher on in Hebrew actually abundant but it&#39;s my review so there. Lol

All in all a really nice find on Melrose not a destination but very good. Shalom baby and Mazel Tov enjoy Shefa."

INSIDE! Sold. I didn&#39;t even know what a laffa was yet, but I was jazzed that French fries was one of the four fillers you can add to your sandwich. Yep, four of these to choose from: schug amba, pickles, fries, hummus, tahini, babaganoush, red cabbage, white cabbage, Israeli salad. 

I was a little overwhelmed at first, and thought these were sides, but once I sat down (after I ordered and paid for said chicken laffa I was still a little unsure about), I was presented with this beautiful plate of Mediterranean accoutrements...their version of banchan, chips and salsa, bread basket, what have you. I could have just eaten this medley of &#34;meze salads&#34; that included beets, carrots, garbonzo beans, corn, cabbage, and a handful of some slaw-esque type substance. It was seriously a meal on its own, not to mention super beautiful! 

Then came a gargantuan chicken wrap in the laffa. I finally understood that laffa is the pillowy, chewy flatbread holding the moist grilled chicken, French fries, hummus, tahini, and Israeli salad. It was a two-hand holding kind of wrap. The laffa was superb. I want all my meat wrapped in it from now on. A really stand out meal on Melrose for under $15 with tax and tip.

A pretty sizable space, where you order and pay, then get a number, but with staff that still walks around to check on you/pick up empty plates."

I had high hopes, THANKS TO ALL THE REVIEWS... But was insanely disappointed and left with an extremely full stomach.

Since coming back from Scotland (and eating the most amazing Middle Eastern bread EVER), my fianc√© has been on the hunt to find said bread again. One of the reviews on Yelp proclaimed that the bread here was OUT OF THIS WORLD... But my fianc√© begs to differ. Sure, he&#39;s picky, but I can attest that the bread didn&#39;t seem all that great, minus it being nice and warm, and doughy. 

I&#39;m thrilled my fianc√© is on the hunt for this bread though because I&#39;m OBSESSED with chicken shawarma, and while I&#39;ve found some tasty places here in LA... I&#39;m still on the HUNT for THE BSST in ALL OF LOS ANGELES. Well, I can cross this place off the list of places in the running because it was no good. 

I got the chicken shawarma... And after I ordered it and it was plated and served to me, I was informed it was mixed with lamb. While I do eat red meat, I don&#39;t typically eat it at restaurants (I&#39;m insanely picky) and I am really not a lamb fan so I was really turned off. That being said, I dug in because I was so hungry I could have eaten 3 whole lamb right then and there. The shawarma was fatty and oily, and I knew it was going to linger in my stomach ALL DAY LONG and even maybe cause me to take a nap later, alas, I continued to eat. Some people have no will power when it comes to sweets, for me... It&#39;s meat and fish! Ha! The only thing I &#34;liked&#34; about this shawarma was the hunt of cinnamon I tasted post swallowing. 

The cucumber salad that came along side was good, but I mean, it was cucumbers and tomatoes, can&#39;t really give this place credit for that. That being said the hummus was tasty! 

My fianc√© I KNEW didn&#39;t really like it, but he&#39;s a trooper and was hungry as well, so gobbled most of it up. He proceeded to ask for a to-go box (cause he&#39;s a puss and can&#39;t finish his plate, lol, or maybe he&#39;s smart?) and packed the rest of his meal up to go. I mean, that could be a good sign but let&#39;s see how long it stays in the fridge UNTOUCHED... Ha Ha Ha!

I&#39;m disappointed that this place wasn&#39;t good in my opinion, maybe their salmon is better? Well, that will be an unsolved quandary because I never plan on going back here again."

Generous portions and well balanced flavors. It is not just an onslaught of grease and sauces masking the food. The lafa  genuinely had  delicious meat and toppings. 

 staff was excellent and funny, Especially the waiters. They are  funny and pleasant. When my friend jokingly  asked about  sending his almost finished order back for a full refund they played  a long in a funny  way and we had a good laugh.

Ana literally came to our table 10 times to ask if we needed anything else. 
Now on to the food. We ordered family style so we could try everything on the menu. The make or break dish of any restaurant like this is the shawarma. We got the laffa wrap and it was amazing. Enough to fill any hunger. Comes with bunch of sides included in the sand which. I got salad, fries and cabbage. Again amazing. The plates are pretty big so it&#39;s easy to share.

Their portions are priced well and the food itself is flavorful. If you are looking for a place with great service or to host a small party please stay away. For a couple of weeks I had been planning a dinner for 9 people. It was a special occasion and I had called several times before even being able to talk to someone about setting up a reservation. Finally I got to talk to David the owner who promised me that everything will be set up and that I will just pay a per person set amount and the food and soft drinks will be taken care of. When we got there NOTHING was set up. The restaurant was empty so being busy was not an excuse. David tells me that it would be easier if we just order off the regular menu and to forget about the preplanned deal we made. It was nothing short of a cluster fuck. I ended up just going to the counter and ordering a bunch of their plates. The food was just brought out and there was no effort made to make sure we were taken care of or comfortable. Again, the entire restaurant was EMPTY this entire time. The owners and the wait staff were just sitting chilling in the front of the restaurant. Other than coming by to try to clear our plates, clearly eager to get us out of there, no other effort was made to make us comfortable. I was embarrassed and ashamed since I was the one who organized it as it seemed like I put ZERO effort into organizing the dinner. 

There is a reason the kosher restaurant a block away does so much better than this place and always will. The service here is HORRIBLE. These people are learning a valuable lesson that just because you have a couple of recipes and the money to open up a place across the way from a very successful kosher establishment, it does not mean you will do well. It is a shame as in the right hands this place has potential. Unfortunately the right hands are not the current owners&#39;."

I&#39;m keeping my review 5 stars because the food was so fresh tasting and flavorful, the staff are absolutely lovely.

I had the chicken kabob (white meat), and he had the spiced ground chicken skewer.  The food was fine, but we felt it was pretty overpriced *for what it is* (each of our meals cost around $18).  Frankly, there are other less expensive places to get Mediterranean food that tastes just as good, if not better.  

The portions were generous, however, and came with 4 small side salad-type things (some sort of chickpea salad, something with beets, a shredded carrot salad thing, and a corn salad thing).  We didn&#39;t get the typical Mediterranean accoutrements of hummus and/or garlic sauce, which was a bit of a surprise/disappointment.  They do have hummus on the menu, but evidently, it does not come with their entrees.  

The choices of sides for their entrees is also strangely limited, and not terribly appealing.  For example, you can&#39;t get a basic green salad as an entree side (even though, again, there is one elsewhere on the menu).  The sides choices were fries, green beans, rice or grilled onions/tomatoes/peppers.  I opted for the green beans, which sort of tasted like they were from a can, and the grilled onions etc., which were decent.

This place just opened, so they also seem to be sorting out their systems, and it was a bit of a wait before we were able to put in our orders.  Not a big deal, since we were in no rush, and the staff was very nice; but, I&#39;d definitely recommend calling ahead for takeout orders.

It&#39;s a shame that this place simply doesn&#39;t live up to their prices, or else we would be back.  We live just a few blocks away, and love Mediterranean food.  Sadly, it just isn&#39;t worth it."

I order kufte kabob (ground beef delicately spiced and grilled) served over a bed of aromatic rice with a side of Israeli chopped salad (tomatoes, cukes). The service was quick, the tables were clean, the price was fair and no repercussions, LOL! Oftentimes, after a Mediterranean dinner, it&#39;s tough to sleep - with excessive spices coming up...ya, know...but this did not occur after a hearty meal at Shefa.

I had to try those two staples of Israeli cuisine; if you mess those up, there isn&#39;t much else to do there. But they were great!

Everything about it was just amazing. First you get pita and like a bunch of side salad plates. Those and the flavors of the chicken and the shawarma and even the veggies and sides were not only authentic but you can tell it had to be carefully perfected.

The restaurant is cosy and you can choose to either sit at the bar or at one of the little tables- I love the one in the far corner right by the wall (which you can graffiti to your heart&#39;s content!). The staff are very friendly and always willing to talk you through the menu should you have questions and the service is pretty quick.

My go to is usually the Steamed Pork Gyoza for a Starter and then either the Pesto Ramen or the Tonkatsu Ramen with extra Pork Belly. Both are super, super tasty and will definitely hit the spot!

My friends and I stopped by around 12 am and there was no wait. The menu is different from most ramen places I&#39;ve been to. The extra toppings are a little confusing. Free topping with check in though. 

I ordered the spicy ramen with chicken broth. I was skeptical because I&#39;m not usually a fan of chicken broth but after trying it at this place I order it all the time now! It was quite delicious. The spice level was subtle but builds up while you keep eating. I added a seasoned egg as my topping with check in. 

Gyoza and karaage are not bad either. Pretty standard. The environment is a little run down. Writing on the wall. Storage areas visible. A little bit small. 

The bright side is : OPEN LATE AND PRIVATE PARKING LOT! Do I have to say more?"

Us visiting L.A from Denver know that there is no good ramen here. I love Japanese food and when we travel to Cali we have to have it as much as possible! 

My husband and I loved it! My ramen was mouthwatering delicious!!! All the food we ordered was fresh and the spicy miso broth was heaven!! Yummy!!! 

Be aware, this place is super tiny, so if you&#39;re planning on coming here with a large group I&#39;d recommend calling in for reservations.

Atmosphere: really causal, and laid back, with lots of drawings on the walls.
Food: a little disappointed after reading the other reviews. We got two ramen bowls and an appetizer. Both broths seemed to have something missing.. The shio broth was not very salty. Everything we ordered was a little bit oilier than in a typical ramen joint which affected the flavor. The egg was still cold. The ramen noodles themselves were good. Presentation is very nice.
Service: the waitress was very prompt when we called out to her, but was otherwise on her phone at the counter or in the corner. Maybe I didn&#39;t communicate the Yelp check in enough because I was charged for the extra toppings.

Overall, not a bad place for late night nibblies but we might have gone somewhere else under other circumstances"

This place is more than Just OK, which is a 3 star review, but there were a couple of issues with the Shin Ramen I ordered, so it&#39;s not quite a 4 start Yay I&#39;m a Fan place.  The broth was good but I wished there was more.  The ramen was cooked well, al dente.  I&#39;m just not a fan with the chef&#39;s method of cooking thin slices of chasu with a cooking torch.  It comes out a bit like over-cooked thin slices of deli ham, hardened and a bit rubbery.

I ordered the appetizer of karaage (boneless fried chicken).  Shin Ramen&#39;s version are brined pieces of chicken meat lightly dusted with (rice?) flour and deep fried to give the exterior a nice crisp.  Love the different take on karaage, and it was very good.

I do want to come back and try their vegan ramen, though."

Location isn&#39;t too big but it wouldn&#39;t hurt them if they had one more waiter. The plain ramen with pork is about $12 and the pork lacks flavor and the ramen is average, the great thing really is the broth which I enjoyed but it needed more stuff without being priced!"

We got pork shoyu ramen, which the staff recommended. When we received our bowls and stuck our spoons in, there was a gelatinous layer of fat that stuck  to the spoon and pulled
the whole layer off the top. You know? I know ramen is supposed to be fatty and salty, but surely not this fatty and this salty. We left with sodium-burned tounges and a layer of fat that re-formed as we finished our bowls. Gnarly. 

That being said, it wasn&#39;t the worst ramen, the service was nice, and ordering fresh garlic meant a pot of cloves and a garlic masher (thingy?) delivered to your table which was great.

It&#39;s really small, only like 5 tables plus the bar seats and patio. 

We sat at the bar. Servers kept asking cooks when certain orders will be ready Bc things were taking a long time. The ramen dishes seem too labor intensive and require too many ingredients for 1 person to be making it all. Some menu items have bizarre names with no explanations of what&#39;s in the dish. The place was loud and energy was chaotic. 

Appetizers (veggie gyoza and pesto edamame) were relatively quick but ramen took forever. I had the veggie one. It was kind of bland and lacking excitement but presentation was pretty. Gyoza and edamame were good.

My family and I took a road trip to LA from the BAY just to eat per youj and was in the area because we hiked at Runyon. My niece wanted ramen and saw this place on the way, I checked the reviews &amp; the place seemed legit so we went for it. 

THE FOOD: 
1. Chicken Karaage: the chicken was pretty soggy and was not crispy at all. It was also lacking flavor. The sauces that came with it was basic ranch and sweet chili sauce, nothing special. 
2. Fire ramen with chicken: I added sweet corn, egg, and the zebra garlic sauce. My biggest complaint is the fact that my soup wasn&#39;t served hot. It almost seemed like it was sitting out for hella long before it was given to me. On top of that, it lacked flavor I don&#39;t know if it is because I chose chicken instead of pork but it definitely wasn&#39;t special or hitting the spot. Usually I feel like ramen is too salty, this was the first time I felt like it lacked salt. The spice was probably a 2/10 for me. The chicken was also hella dry. 
3. Zebra sauce: I didn&#39;t get what was so good about this. I didn&#39;t know what to expect but what I got seemed to be or taste like the oil from burnt garlic. 
4. Pesto edamame: hella interesting... we kept trying to figure out if we really liked it or if it was just hella weird lol. 
5. Chicken miso ramen: I just tried the broth and I do think it was better than the fire ramen I ordered BUT it was also COLD! 
6. They fo sho serve tap water OR whatever is in their water is nasty. 

Overall, I didn&#39;t think there was anything special about this place. I do not plan on coming back. Maybe it was what I ordered but I do know my food was served cold and it ruined the whole experience for me."

I was meeting a girlfriend in LA for lunch and when we were deciding on a place she said if I had not yet gone to Shin Ramen we simply MUST GO .... Boy was she right! I wish I had more days in LA to go back as I would have... again and again.

I had the Ghost dip, and i would seriously go back to LA for it... it was so so SO GOOD!!. The torched the marshmallow tableside and dunked it into the broth and swirled it around.... mmmmmmmm i am salivating just thinking about it.... so tempted to book a flight...
The edamame was unlike any I have ever had before with the pesto coating, but I really liked it. They are able to make most dishes vegetarian or vegan so that nice too - I think that may eb partly why she likes the place so much, and shes big into magic like myself.

The owner saw my purse and came right over to introduce himself, as he KNEW I must be associated with magic. 

if you want to write on the wall ask for the bowl of markers, they will happily give it to you.

It&#39;s a smaller venue, and parking seems like it would have been a pain... I was luckily not driving... but the friend I was meeting was and she said its not a great parking lot. It is tucked into a corner complex with several other businesses, so don&#39;t blink or you might miss it. But it is right on Hollywood BLVD, so if you are walking the strip why not stop in for a snack??

BONUS - there seems to be a GOOD CHANCE you will run into some magicians here!

We started with the vegetable gyoza ($5) and these were pretty good---savory and nicely done.

The veggie miso ramen ($8) is vegan by default, but you have to get the extra-wide noodles (+$1), as opposed to the default noodles, so make sure to specify. Each extra topping adds $1, so things add up pretty quickly.

I thought the ramen was decent, but not great. The broth is mild and you don&#39;t get much by way of vegetables. If you add tofu, the tofu is just dumped into the bowl, raw; I wish they fried it, the way Tatsu and Chibiscus do.

The service was friendly, attentive and knowledgeable. 

All told, Shin isn&#39;t bad, but isn&#39;t great. If you&#39;re looking for more flavorful vegan ramen, I&#39;d suggest Chibiscus or Tatsu."

i decided to order the pesto ramen because i&#39;m a huge fan of pesto! but this combination made me very skeptical. i asked the waiter if he&#39;s ever tried it and he said he really likes the pesto ramen. i figured that since i&#39;m in LA, i should give this a try. i ordered the pesto ramen with pork, but they ran out of pork so they gave me chicken and a discount off my meal!

pesto ramen with chicken: (5/5 stars) i loved this ramen! it&#39;s thick ramen marinated in pesto without soup. it&#39;s topped with some cheese and comes with a side of salad. i was very satisfied with my meal. pesto really does make food taste so much better!

notes: the interior is really interesting; there&#39;s graffiti all over the walls. the restaurant is really small and cozy, not recommended for large groups. the service is wonderful! our waiter was super friendly and gave us a discount on our meals because two of us ordered chicken but they didn&#39;t have chicken so they gave us pork inside. the ramen here is good, all my friends enjoyed their meals. i would definitely come back here again, if i&#39;m ever around that area!"

We ordered online through Eat24 but they had just confirmed the order when we walked in, so it took another 25-30 minutes before it was ready. They were very sweet and apologetic about it, offering us a drink on the house to make up for the long wait. 

The place is small and I thought the location was unfortunate, but maybe everything just looked sketchy and eerily quiet at 2am. I really liked my chicken curry: chicken katsu with white meat chicken slathered in curry sauce, on a bed of fluffy white rice. The portion is smaller than I expected and the curry sauce is not the best I&#39;ve had, but it was still very good. The potstickers were freshly made and the dipping sauce had a hint of citrus to it. The eel roll was good and so was the chashu don, although they were a bit stingy with the chashu pieces. 

Probably not worth driving out of the way but great late-night option, friendly folks, and good choices. James wanted sushi and I wanted Japanese comfort food, and we got both and more at Shin Ramen."

The actual food was just okay. My friend&#39;s chicken ramen was pretty bland, and I got their tonkatsu shoyu ramen which I was told by our waiter is the most popular item here. The broth was excellent, but I wasn&#39;t thrilled about the pork in it. There were a few legit slices of chasyu pork, but mostly shabu shabu style pork slices, which I&#39;ve never seen in ramen.

Also, you have to add the egg, and they give you two choices of egg: soft boiled or the more traditional ajitsuke tamago (marinated soft boiled egg). I ordered the regular soft boiled and it was barely boiled! I like my yolk gelatinous but the outside egg whites were barely holding it in so it was like eating a raw egg in my ramen. At least, with the Yelp check-in, the egg was free as you can get any any of their added toppings free (up to $2)."

I would rate them a two but I gave it a three because they have some nice add ons that I&#39;ve never seen at other places before like fire ball, thick noodles, and katsuobushi (dried fish skin) . Still not enough for me to want to return.

Unable to catch my Uber/Lyft following a show at the Hollywood Bowl, I decided it would be best to walk and seek my dining choice once past the tourist hell of Hollywood Boulevard. Restaurants are usually limited to fast food during the early morning hours, and I appreciated the Yelp &#34;open now&#34; button.

The energetic, smiley server, helped me decide on my spicy dish and additions. I had the Fire Ramen with chicken and added garlic. Excellent choice for the chilly hour of midnight. My mouth was numb from the spice and I kept going... breaking a sweat. 

I would rather dine in a small space w late-nite character than a large sterile space, laden with prissy millenial lumberjack look-alikes. I&#39;ve had my best meals at closet-size places across the globe. Shin is perfect for hole-in-the-wall dining.

I came here cause I am always on a ramen hunt and my friends highly recommended it. This was extremely, extremely disappointing. OVERPRICED as hell too. Maybe the location causes for them to hike up their ramen bowls but I mean... they&#39;re sitting there charging $3 for keurig coffee --- it&#39;s a REALLY bad sign.

Look. The service here is good, I see that they are trying to build their clientele and the waiter is very helpful but I&#39;m not gonna lie - my HONEST opnion of this place is that they are making a MOCKERY of what REAL ramen should be and expect ignorant hipsters and such to fall for it.

The ramen i went with was the shin ramen and although I went with 3 toppings that were 99 I ordered some extra noodles which came on the side and were way too much food but of course I had to eat them. 

One of the best bowls of Ramen I have ever had but be careful about extra noodles cause they put plenty in the bowl as it is.

Parking lot is super tiny and when i was ready to leave, it took a while for the Pizza guy next door to move his car.  He moved like molasses and seemed annoyed that we asked him to move his car.

It&#39;s a small restaurant and the tables are close together.  So close that you can listen to the person&#39;s full conversation next to you which is kind of annoying.  I did enjoy people&#39;s drawings on the walls.

Staff was kinda slow for an empty restaurant.  They weren&#39;t welcoming when we walked in and lazily got up to walk us to the table.  We were at a table before them.  Hostess was a bit snobby.  So if you need to eat and go, this is the place.  If you want to eat, relax and enjoy the ambiance, this is definitely not a place to go.  Definitely not a good place for groups more than 4 people.  If there&#39;s 4 of you, I hope you&#39;re okay being all cozy together. 

Soup was hot. Tasty (but not as tasty as my other place) and didn&#39;t have any other flavor bombs that other Ramen places offer. 

Overall, okay if I don&#39;t feel like driving too far to another ramen restaurant."

We had chicken ramen, soba ramen without meat, and the cucumber salad. The salad was pretty good, but not not very flavorful. 

The chicken in the chicken ramen was dry and without a lot of flavor. Like all the meat it was pre-cooked and then put in a pan that they used to hold it while they used a blow torch to sear it a bit, but with the chicken at least, all it did was make it dryer. 

The soba wasn&#39;t made from buckwheat they were just a thicker ramen noodle. And the sauce was just ok. 

They apparently get their noodles shipped in from overseas, which kind of went with the whole vibe of the place - like it wasn&#39;t so much a kitchen as it was a place where they heat up food. While we were sitting at the counter the cook was putting cardboard boxes of packaged individual servings of noodles from on the counter where they prepped the food, and he used one of the knives from the kitchen to cut open the boxes. It made me a little nervous, although I didn&#39;t see anything else like that - they otherwise seemed pretty clean. But I&#39;m definitely not going back.

However, they are more expensive than your typical Ramen place.  It is Hollywood so what do you expect.  

I am a little disappointed with the confusing pricing on the menu.  They charge for every topping!  I got the Tonkotsu Shoyu which comes with mushroom, tamago, and corn as the default toppings.  I thought they would be included in the price but no!  I was charged a couple dollars for each of those &#34;default&#34; toppings.  

Overall the Ramen soup had great flavor and the noodles were perfect.  However, I would not come to this place purposely as there are better and more reasonably priced Ramen shops in LA. 

Don&#39;t get the fireball topping - it&#39;s not what you think.  I was expecting a beef meatball but it&#39;s actually a ball of spicy peppers with beef flavoring. 

For appetizers, I got the dragon balls - deep fried octopus balls (takoyaki basically except these were deep fried) topped with Bonito flakes.  They were delish!

SERIOUSLY though, our waiter, Anthony, was so great. He was so happy and had such a great attitude, he welcomed us and explained the menu to us in detail which was super helpful because we can be very indecisive. We ended up getting the pesto ramen and the shin dip.

It was nice to have follow up with the owner... To clarify things... Server was nice but the food was just eh.

I just wanted to write a review sharing my experience, but I&#39;ve been convinced that things have changed since.

WAIT. My family walked over from Madam Tusseaud&#39;s, and there was no wait thankfully. Especially since it&#39;s a small place.

SERVICE. Server was super helpful and friendly. He even told us about the fish shavings that only their restaurant had.

FOOD. I really hate to give low ratings, but I just was not feeling it. Hopefully my review helps!
I wished the broth was hotter, so the noodles can cook fully.
Stick to chashu. Don&#39;t even bother with their chicken. Our server was kind enough to tell us that pork was a preference, but it would be good to try chicken as well--I could lived without knowing how it tastes.
The broth. Some bowls were significantly saltier than others. I&#39;d make sure to tell the server your preference before ordering.
Don&#39;t go crazy on the toppings either. If I had been a frequent ramen eater before this, I would have known which ingredients I can do without to avoid paying so much.

PRICE. Expected high price being in Hollywood. I came here new to the idea of ramen toppings, so I went with their suggested toppings. Each bowl came out to be $20 real quick even with the Yelp deal. It was a new experience so spending that much wasn&#39;t bad hoping it&#39;d be spectacular. I just didn&#39;t think it was worth that much unfortunately. 

I&#39;m not from the area, so I really wanted to try something authentic I don&#39;t have at home. There&#39;s ramen, but not this hole in the wall. Unfortunately, my family was not satisfied with our food. I really hope other long distant visitors have a better experience though.

The food is simply DELICIOUS! The both ramens were very good and the taste is so flavorful. I want to give this place 5 stars &amp; will be going back, &amp; if better service is given of course will up the stars. 

So the bad...

Basically it was really crowded, which is fine, it means it must be tasty. So we sat outside &amp; our waiter came to greet us &amp; explained the menu. When he came back to take our order, in the middle of speaking with him about our order, he walks off to another nearby table (I think he must have known the other customers). After we wanted more tea, &amp; had to ask a different waiter, it was difficult to get anyone&#39;s attention. The wait for the food was so long (other table got theirs before us even though we were there prior to them ). We had told the waiter we were on a way to a show &amp; just wanted the food &amp; the check together (that is how long it took). He was very apologetic, &amp; the food was so good, but the service..ehh..

Decor

The inside seems nice, the high tables &amp; chairs, but it is so packed prepare to sit outside - which is okay !

Parking

It is a small parking lot, we actually got blocked in &amp; had to go to the other small shops &amp; for them to move their car. Nothing to do with this place, but expect to maybe be blocked in or find parking nearby."

The ramen was good not great. I ordered the fire ramen and was expecting, well some kind of heat. That said, it wasn&#39;t very spicy and the soft boiled egg was already starting to break open before I got to eat it. It was still good, but I wasn&#39;t blown away.

PARKING: Sucks, it&#39;s a really small lot but even on a Saturday night we were able to park in a pretty tight space near the restaurant.  The entire plaza is one of those small LA plazas that are hard to get in and out of.  

ATMOSPHERE: The place is TINY, it has bar seating and 2 large tables with 2 tables for 2.  I actually made reservations online and when we got there the big table just got filled so the hostess offered us the bar seating (for 5 of us) but I said we would rather wait.  I&#39;m not sure if they never got our reservation (perhaps they thought we weren&#39;t coming because we were 5 min late).  Regardless, the other group left so we squeezed into the other table.  This is definitely not conducive to large groups.

There is an open kitchen though so if you sit at the bar you can see the chefs cooking the ramen.  One of the chefs does the signature ramen noodle shake.  There is writing all over the wall from people signing it and it kind of has that hollywood old hip vibe.

FOOD: The reason I wanted to try this place was because they get their noodles from the SUN NOODLE brand.  I&#39;ve talked about them before but they make the noodles for a lot of Japanese ramen shops around the US, Tsujita being one them so I always know they&#39;ll have good quality noodles.

PORK SOUP WITH ZEBRA DIP - I decided to go with the traditional pork and was slightly disappointed.  I was hoping for a slightly creamy, thick, fatty soup but it was almost like a shoyu broth.  It was flavorful but not what I was expecting.  I did get the Zebra dip which was the garlic black sauce and that added an extra depth of flavor which was really good - highly recommended!  OPT for the THICK NOODLES because by default they give you thin.  Thin, straight noodles (which I don&#39;t like).  Their thick noodles remind me of ben ten ramen or tsujita.  Not quite as chewy as tsujita but pretty darn close.  So GOOD!!! Definitely what made me want to give it a 4 star rating.

The Onsen Tamago  or soft boiled egg is NOT the one you are thinking of.  It&#39;s a poached egg.  The Ajitsuke Tamago is the one that looks like a hard boiled egg but is soft on the inside and salted.  I was sad I got the poached one, it was still good again, not what I was expecting.

Pork was thin and lean. Not much fat and not that tasty.

KARAAGE - The downside was that it was all white meat and came out more like chicken strips than round pieces of karaage.  It had a more fried texture than crispy, almost like a tempura that is a shell and not flaky and crumbly and light.  The dipping sauces seemed to be a hit though.

Overall - great if you love thick noodles.  Just need to know how to order next time."

We started with the pesto edamame. Wow! Why have I never thought of this before. I&#39;m officially obsessed. 

My husband got the zebra garlic dip, I got a chicken ramen with custom toppings. Both were amazing. The dips have fatter noodles and a more concentrated broth. The ramen has thin noodles and a regular broth with your topping. Both were delicious. The zebra garlic is pretty strong, so if you get it as a topping use it sparingly. I also got a butter topping - I don&#39;t feel like it did much.

The hostess was busy talking to a boy at the register and had to be flagged down for attention more than once. I ordered the dip tonkatsu. The broth was not very rich, the noodles were cold, the pork tasted like charred pieces of thin ham, and the soft-boiled egg I ordered as an extra came out freezing cold, as if it had been sitting in ice water before it was served. Once the cold egg + noodles were dipped into the broth, that just made the broth cold too. But I just thought &#34;meh, ok&#34; and went home. 

Later that night, I awoke at 2am feeling queasy and then ran to the toilet to puke my guts out. The next day, my stomach was not happy.

I always go for the Zebra Dip because it&#39;s one of the most flavorful broths I&#39;ve had. Share a Fireball with a friend because they give you too much for 1 meal. Also go with the egg because who doesn&#39;t have eggs with ramen?!

I love ramen and have tried tons of different places so I like to think I know a good ramen when I have it. I can say with absolute confidence that this was by far the worst ramen I&#39;ve ever had. The only reason I didn&#39;t go to my usual spots is because I like trying new places and they had 4 stars on Yelp. Now I can only assume most of the reviews are fake or friends of the business... I was going to give them 2 stars since the service was decent but the more I think about the more I feel it&#39;s my duty to inform people. First off, I should have known better after hearing they don&#39;t even make their own noodles. From the pictures I saw, they use Sun noodles, which are at least the best pre-packaged noodles you can get (in my opinion). 
We sat down outside and strike 2 was their menu: confusing and wayyy overpriced. They list their standard bowls but then under each one have extra add ons (most included sauteed mushrooms) which add about $3 on top of the already overpriced bowl which they have priced around $13. I got the shoyu and gf ordered what I think was the shio. They weren&#39;t even that big. We both had a soft boiled egg and it was premade. How do I know? Because it was cold when broken in the soup which tells me it was sitting in a fridge. Also, it was way too soft and runny. Like I previously stated, nothing special about the noodles. The broth didn&#39;t have much flavor. Now, the pork may have been what bothered me the most.. Tough, chewy, super thin slices that seemed to me like they were quick grilled weird cuts. If it was pork belly, it was cooked terribly wrong. Reminded me of European style bacon. 
If I hear anyone say this place has good traditional ramen, they will automatically lose all food credibility with me. I hate to be so cruel and I don&#39;t usually leave such negative reviews but it is what it is. I make better instant ramen at home.."

Some of my favorites such as Zebra dip and Johnny dip were still on the menu.  I looked for my first choice for all the time, Spider Men, and I think now they call it Fire Ramen.  

Only disappointment was that ramen was served lukewarm.  I like my noodles, especially ramen noodle, served piping hot, so I was bummed out over this slightly heated soup.

A good helping of freshly made ramen noodles, and a light, airy and flavorful broth, with some tender pieces of meat/protein. By those standards, a bowl of ramen from Shin Ramen is pure perfection! 

I ordered the chicken miso ramen bowl, and I&#39;m the kind of person who orders ramen for it&#39;s broth, and that broth was absolutely divine. The chicken broth was subtle and clean tasting, and that punch of miso broth added to the mix made the combination absolutely irresistible. The noodles were obviously fresh and absolutely perfect, and the portion was huge. The chicken was grilled to perfection, and tender and succulent. It was all topped with fresh scallions, fresh garlic, and corn (a personal addition). I added a good helping of chili oil and chili flakes, but that is because I love it hot - it would be just as sublime without it. In addition to the ramen being great, their Japanese green tea was so absolutely comforting, I can&#39;t even begin to describe it! 

The ambience is spot on, and the staff along with the chefs are really friendly, making the dining experience extra special. If nothing else, go for the fun walls that are covered in fun messages from diners just like you and I. All in all, Shin Ramen were an absolute delight for this couple visiting from Chicago!"

Like, completely, totally, absolutely, unquestionably obsessed. Like, three times a week obsessed. Ugh! I want some NOW! (There&#39;s only one thing I get this way about, and let me tell ya, it ain&#39;t food!)

It&#39;s a blessing and a curse that Shin is literally half a block from my house, about 5 minutes walking distance. Considering delivery is $5 and the parking lot is like a live game of vehicular tetris wherein you&#39;re battling for a spot against the aggressive taxi drivers who frequent Ruobo&#39;s and the delivery drivers from Raffalo&#39;s, walking is truly the best option. But man, is it worth it. 

The place itself is nondescript at best. Open kitchen, bar-style, with three tables inside and a few out on the sidewalk inside the plaza (it can barely be called a patio). The walls are covered in the colorful marker scribbles of patrons past and present. Upon entering, the waiters and chefs alike bark out a hello in Japanese (at least I think it&#39;s a hello - they could very well be yelling &#34;beware!&#34; or &#34;fuck off!&#34;). When they&#39;re not crazy busy, you get to choose the bar, inside or outside seating. Before, they used to have canned drinks, which sucked because you had to pay for every can, but now they have a soda machine. Much better! 

The waiters and chefs are all super friendly, and they all remember my order down to the little specifics (no greens, extra sauce!), probably because I&#39;m there several times a week. The food is always excellent. My favorites are definitely the karage chicken appetizer, chasu-dan rice bowl (pork) and chicken ghost dip (with burned marshmallow!) If you&#39;re eating there, one of the waiters comes out with a fire-breathing extinguisher and burns the marshmallow right into your ghost dip. It&#39;s awesome! 

It&#39;s a ton of food for the price, and I can&#39;t say enough about how damned delicious it is. Hands down my favorite spot for a quick lunch/dinner in LA. For a while they went through some difficulties with consistent operating times and constant name/ownership changes, but it seems that the latest ownership has gotten it right and now Shin is open on Mondays, and late at night, and doesn&#39;t close several hours a day between lunch and dinner. A true gem hidden in a little corner plaza on the corner of Hollywood and La Brea."

Finally had a finishing touch which is a scoop of ice cream. Seseame is inside and it&#39;s not sweet which meets my needs. The whip cream is just as soft like marshmellow.

If there&#39;s an oil crisis in this country, there wasn&#39;t one at shin ya - i ordered the soy sauce pork ramen (tonkatsu shoryu) + egg and friend ordered the shinya dip pork.

So the broth had the promising black garlic oil flavoring that i love but failed in its layers of oil. So oily my ramen and my pork were shiny like chrome. So oily my cholesterol went up just from the smell. So oily I instantly broke out with acne. The dip also had this issue.

We both filtered the oil out with spoons and poured it into another bowl. By then the experience was tainted and our joy vanished.

The egg was not worth the $1. It&#39;s not the hard boiled kind. They cracked open an egg and dropped it in the broth. The egg whites dissipated and the yolk melted into the broth. I&#39;m pretty okay with it not being hard boiled but I lose the egg as a topping because I end up not being able to taste it.

I&#39;ve been informed in the past that its wasn&#39;t this bad before. I&#39;m willing to try it again but for now, 2 stars because 1 additional star for benefit of the doubt until next attempt."

I complain and complain about everything being too salty when I go out, especially when it comes to soups, so it actually blows my mind that their broth isn&#39;t salty enough for me.

Went with a friend on a Friday night. It wasn&#39;t too crowded, a mix of couples and families with kids. Since I didn&#39;t have a chance to do the typical research I normally would before trying a new restaurant, I found the menu to be pretty overwhelming and it took me a while to settle on something. I went with the Bonito Dashi Ramen, which is supposed to come with chicken or pork, leafy greens and extra noodles. I was thrown again when our server asked me what I wanted on it...I thought the point of having detailed dishes on a menu was that you get what they describe? I ended up getting chicken, leafy greens, and cherry tomatoes for the sake of trying something new.

We threw on an order of gyoza to start. Despite being super charred to the point where all you could taste was the char at first, I did find that the inside was delicious and would order this again, but maybe ask for them not to be burnt to a crisp. 

Despite being warned by one of the staff members that the chili oil could potentially melt my face off if not used sparingly, I found that it and the red pepper seasoning they brought me didn&#39;t do much to enhance the flavor or heat of the broth. Still, they were comforting additions. The noodles were cooked well - just slightly al dente and never got soggy. My friend opted for the thick noodles, which were also good. For a local place that prevents me from having to drive downtown, Shin Ramen is just fine. Not the best, but satisfying just the same."

I remembered eating here a few years back and it was AMAZING hot soup with rich flavors just the perfect combination of thick broth and crisp/soft noodles.  You could clearly tell it was heavily worked on with mature nuanced flavors. 

I&#39;m sad to say that this is not the soup I had last night.  It was a bland liquid and wasn&#39;t even hot!  The chicken tasted like it was cooked in an electric toaster from frozen without any added steps, chasu pork was rubbery and had the look and texture of a lunchables.  I&#39;m embarrassed to have recommended and convinced my friend to eat here. 

I only found out later that they have changed ownership, which I can only assume is the reason for the massive change in one of my once favorite ramen places.

Anthony went over the lunch specials, different ramen styles and followed up with me thru out my meal. Nice guy and so friendly.
Ordered a small portion $6 Kara-Age Chicken. The batter was light and flavorful. The chicken was cooked to a crispy texture, and tender meat. It came with a side of ranch and side of nuoc cham (vietnamese sweet &amp; sour sauce) for dipping. This was an odd pairing and the only reason for the 4-star rating. A side of Kewpie mayo would better compliment this dish.
I went with the $12 Shin Ramen, which I was told was made with both pork and chicken broth. I opted for the $2 upgrade with pork belly.  Then added the following for $1 each: $3 Chasha pork shoulder, $1 Onsen Tamago and $2 sauteed mushrooms. (*Must order a minimum of 3 toppings get them at a $1 each. Otherwise, you pay the listed prices for each)
Great ramen! The broth was super good and the noodles were yummy. Writing about it makes me hungry again. Going forward, I would pass on the sides as the pork belly portion was very generous for me.

I was worried that they&#39;d mess with the perfect recipe (because there was no way it could be improved) but can happily report that Shin Ya is essentially the same.

My usual:
Steamed Gyoza
Chicken Ramen with thin noodles, mushrooms, and greens + a fireball

I can&#39;t speak to anything else on the menu, or even any other type of ramen... but I can say that my usual is good enough that I get it at least once a month.

It&#39;s a very small/awkward space with limited seating (just like Ikemen) and the parking lot is equally small and can be a challenge, but it&#39;s worth the hassle because it&#39;s the best ramen around (albeit not the cheapest, around $20 after tip).

Tasty + 1 = 4
Open Late (2am)+ 1 = 5
Pricy - 1 = 4
Cold Egg - 1 = 3

Pretty sure I could have gotten Salmonella poisoning. I had added a soft boiled egg (+1 dollar) and it was ICE COLD. (fun fact, in Japan the quality of the eggs are to the point where they guarantee you can eat it raw)

The Chashu Pork is DELICIOUS, it was also lHUGE. From the cut it looks like its either Shoulder Meat or Butt Meat. 

Bowls start at around 9 dollars for just Ramen and the broth... 2 dollars to add pork or chicken, and every additional topping is 1-3 dollars... 

Thats where it gets expensive. They have presets combos for you to, like one of the Ramen I believe was Koiterri? was 17.25 or somehting like that after you add veggies. 13 for just the pork + ramen. 

The manager had no idea what&#39;s good on the menu. She &#34;new&#34;

The chef is really nice, after i told him about the cold egg who just said sorry its because FDA requires the eggs to be cold when being stored. What they can do is leave out the egg for 10-15 minutes so it can cool to room temperature. before they put it in to boil. 

Lesson Learn? Get a Medium Boiled EGG!

TL;DR Skip the Veggies, EGG was cold so get it medium boiled. CHASHU AND BROTH WAS DELICIOUS!!! Add-Ons are too pricy."

Out of disclosure and the place has no indoor dining area, only stone outdoor tables and most of their menu items or $10 or more, BUT I had one of their unbelievable specials which was $4 bbq shredded pork sandwich on a whole wheat bun then I added a small half-cup side order of their recommended macaroni salad. The barbecue pork was cooked perfectly and they gave a humongous meat serving for the price so my small side dish choice turned out to be perfect without much added guilt. The only reason why I did not give it a four star rating is because their mixed sauce (a blend of their regular and spicy could&#39;ve been a bit tangier--and though it was not horrible, it almost had a hint of mediciney taste. It did not ruin my meal, it just brought the taste down a notch. But the overall value was pretty amazing. The macaroni salad was perfect not too sweet, not too soggy and had a great flavor.

They have an extremely limited selection of fountain drinks and only offer sweet tea, so actually skipped having a beverage (since I recently had a chilled Yebermate tea a bit earlier. Phillips also offers a $ 6 barbecue chicken breast sandwich on a French roll that looked good and much cheaper than their regular menu. Their specials include a barbecue tri-tip salad for only $5.50.

I got the combo dinner with pork ribs and chicken with two sides (baked beans &amp; macaroni salad). Everything was finger licking good! Oh and the portions are big. I still got some leftover meat.

Okay seriously this is the best bbq in the world. I heard there is a popular/ similar place in San Diego but this is the OG. It is soo delicious we do not care to cook for dinner on Thanksgiving or Christmas because this food will have our back and bellys. The line is a hit n miss but it&#39;s worth it. If you will be making a large order feel free to call it in or vice versa I think you can order small orders as well. But I vaguely LOVE making that line and waiting for my Hot, Juicy, Tender BEEF LINKS to come out. 

There is no formal seating inside but one can sit outside, which I do because my house is too far. 

I need to say though, the amount of respect I have for this place because for, the what? ten years (I think) I have gotten their food from either this location or the other one, they haven&#39;t remodeled or &#34;sold out&#34;, they still provide the same Superb quality of food."

I struggle...while I agree the rib tips were absolutely delicious, I felt that Sweet Baby Rays would have served as a better sauce than what they put on their meat. I was also disappointed in a menu without fries, but the mac-n-cheese was a moderate substitute. 

Service was friendly and fast enough. Although this was a small establishment with no indoor seating, the outdoor bar seats and table rounds were inviting. Parking is likewise minimal, but we circled once and snagged a spot directly in front of the entrance."

Fell in love with the baby backs on the 4th of July and couldn&#39;t resist going back for more! So good. Really tender and smokey considering they had a line 20- deep outside the door. Paid extra for sauce on the side to really taste the flavor of the meat and check out them smoke rings. 

To my great disappointment they were closed on 7/5. On 7/6, I was back to try the sliced beef, beef links and rib tips. Basically, just ate the rib tips. The sliced beef was a bit dry and the sausage was way too mushy for my likings. As for the sides, I ordered potato salad and beans but when I got home I had macaroni salad (ughh...miracle whip) and beans! Still gave them 4 stars because I go for the ribs, not the sides. Just order ribs (a la carte)---beef, pork, baby back, rib tip or small ends---and you&#39;ll be doing the happy dance! 

Lots of people complain about the service but these folks were professional and very patient dealing with so many customers! These  are hardworking black folks and they were on top of their shit during my visits! BBQ takes time to prepare properly.

It had a little too much sauce for my liking (it was too wet if you no what I mean) and the flavoring was a little too sweet.  The sandwich I got was packed full of meet which was a plus.

The ribs would be awesome if Phillips sold them as beef jerky.  Obviously over-cooked, cooked too fast, or boiled and then cooked on a grill over high heat.  Whatever the cause, it was like chewing leather.  Equally bad, several pieces had that refrigerator/freezer burn taste.

The coleslaw was either made in a commissary kitchen or purchased from Smart &amp; Final because it is a plain vanilla, overly dressed slaw - and like the ribs it appeared to be several days old.


The baked beans must be the red-headed sister of the coleslaw because they also appeared to be either purchased somewhere else or made in a Phillips commissary.  Nothing tasted homemade.

The space now occupied by Phillips used to be Leo&#39;s BBQ.  Phillips has invested exactly ZERO after acquiring Leo&#39;s.  And certainly hasn&#39;t improved the BBQ.  This area of LA really deserves a place and an owner that understand BBQ ribs, brisket, and sausage -- my lesson cost me $23 bucks and change.  If I was eating the same amount in real beef jerky it would have cost $40 so there&#39;s that."

Usually it is the one near Leimert Park but that area&#39;s all tore up right now... and we just happened to be on the corner of Adams and Crenshaw.

This Phillips is a bit more &#34;approachable&#34; for non-residents than the Leimert Park one. The lobby is a bit bigger and parking is a bit easier. The staff is friendly and rather patient when taking orders. Despite the sign on the wall preparing customers on how to order fast, there is always the inevitable indecision that slows things down.

We bought a bunch of food this time: like two meals and three sandwiches. The orders seemed to be recorded correctly but unfortunately what we took home was only mostly correct. On one order we got a meat we can&#39;t remember ordering (maybe we did and forgot) but we also got a sauce (hot) we know we didn&#39;t order. Unfortunately that made it inedible.

There are only two sauces offered: regular, which I don&#39;t really care for too much, and hot, which is really hot. Only by reading YELP did I realize that the correct sauce to request is &#34;mixed&#34;. I don&#39;t know if that option is mentioned on the menu or not but it is certainly something to remember for the future.

The rib ends were really good. One needs to bit around the bone (yes!!!) but also be careful of bone fragments and small pieces of cartilage (part of the fun). The sliced beef is great. The beef links are not really hot links (a misconception quickly corrected by the gent taking our order). They are tasty but rather dry. Not my favorite but better than no sausage at all.

Side orders... great potato salad and cole slaw.  Really great. I have no idea if it is made in house or comes from a factory but I really like them.  Same with the beans. I can&#39;t comment on the greens since they were eaten by someone else before I could get my fork on them. The must have been good, though.

Like others have mentioned, it would be really nice if there was a bit more flexibility on the sides that accompany the meals. Being limited to beans, potato salad, cole slaw, and macaroni salad... but having to buy greens or pay extra for double beans seems a bit chintzy to me.  And why I&#39;m in the mood to offer suggestions -- why only a 3-meat combo; why not a 2-meat combo dinner? Maybe we just didn&#39;t see it on the menu when we were ordering??

Maybe the other secret I need to remember for next time is the Soul Special, a combination plate that seems to offer that flexibility with the sides. It may not look like it, but I got soul too!

The best part -- and maybe a good justification for a 5-star rating no matter what the food and service is like -- is the constant smell of hickory wood smoke that Phillips perfumes the neighborhood with.  Makes my mouth water every time."

First off, the service is so slow. It took over 25 minutes to get in and out. The guys working there were pretty cool but there was only one guy taking orders, one prepping the food, and one packing it up for you. Might want to double up on the prep and packing people to move the line faster. 

They have a combo order of 3 meats but you can&#39;t have baby backs or small tips with it. Even if you want to pay more they won&#39;t let you combo up both. It even says so on their menu...which tells me that people ask for it. So why don&#39;t they just price it accordingly and allow their customers to order what they want!?!?!? I think that&#39;s pretty ridiculous to tell people no they can&#39;t have something their willing to pay for. 

The food was ok at best. I got the chicken links, small ends, baked beans, potato salad and I ordered a 1/2 pint of collard greens which are my usual fav! The sausage tasted funny. Hard to put my finger on it but I was expecting some hot links flavor. But nope. The small ends were good. Tender, smokey, juicy...yum! Baked beans &amp; potato salad were ok. The collards were really bad. Super flat and no flavor. Where&#39;s the smokey goodness? I will say that the mixed BBQ sauce was very tasty, too. Deep, rich, sweet and a little spicy. Just like it should be.

Although I wasn&#39;t overly impressed, I&#39;ll go back to give it another try. Next time I&#39;m gonna just order the baby backs and the chicken. I think they&#39;re the best measure of a BBQ joint. Hopefully the next review will be glowing praise for the food. And I&#39;ll be sure to call in my order ahead next time!"

She was extremely angry and annoyed for absolutely no reason. My fianc√© and I looked this place up and it has pretty good reviews so we decided to try it. It was obviously our first time there and I&#39;m not sure what her problem was. While taking our order, after I asked for what I wanted, she barked for me to repeat it by saying, and I quote: &#34;what is it that you want?!!&#34; She didn&#39;t ask if there was anything else we wanted and didn&#39;t ask us what kind of sauce we wanted on our ribs. At pickup we found out the sauce we got is regular and it is already on the meat. Oh and they had a very large sign saying we should limit conversations and listen to the person taking our order..ARE YOU F@&amp;KING KIDDING ME! 

The food: not bad but nothing special either! Definitely not worth the drive with the lack of customer service skills behind the counter.  We got the soul special, which really just means more sides.. We also got a beef rib sandwich which is just 2 ribs and two slices of regular grocery store bought sandwich bread. The sauce taste like ketchup with spices.. Meat was tough, sides are meh, corn bread is barely edible, and the corn is not sweet at all.

Meal options are Dinners and Sandwiches, one thing notable is that the sandwiches come separated, you get the meat in a container and the white bread in a bag. The bread is normal sandwich bread, like WONDER bread or something. Not the best for eating sloppy BBQ meat, honestly I&#39;ve never attempted to make my &#34;sandwich&#34; into a actual sandwich, it would be much too messy.

Meats:

Brisket: This is where the money is, their sliced brisket is to die for, super tender and flavorful, drenched in BBQ sauce. Very consistent, every time I order this I am blown away.

Beef Ribs: Eh, good, to say the most. Very tasty but, not too tender or plentiful when it comes to the edible parts. 

Beef Hot Links: NO. simply put, they are very mushy, not link like at all. Personally I like a Hot Link with a little crunch. They remind me of sausage patties especially because they come sliced. (when sandwich is ordered at least)

Small Ends were pretty good too.

Sides:

BBQ Beans: Okay, very small amount they give you. Definitely have had better beans elsewhere, but they are not unenjoyable

Mac &amp; Cheese: Kinda gross tbh. Very heavy, which in most cases  is good but literally I put them on my plate at home and they stayed a solid &#34;loaf&#34;.

Greens: Greens are my expertise, I am sad to say, they aren&#39;t the best, somewhat greasy and dry. Another con is that you can&#39;t select them as a side to you meal!!! 8( you have to order them on the side and they don&#39;t sell greens in the smallest container. Only get if you want to pay $4.something for a side dish. Boooooooo

Mac Salad: Okay, not my type of dish regardless. but was forced to try because of limited sides to select with meals.

Parking, Payment, Patrons, Personnel etc:
-Parking is great, they have a private lot
-Accepts cards! and also cash of course
-Patrons are diverse as this place is well known outside of it&#39;s community, at night it can get kinda seedy along Crenshaw.
-Personnel never seems to be happy to be there, wait time is average.
-Convenient that they are open late, most BBQ joints close somewhat early.
-Have a small seating area outside, not the best atmosphere though"

I requested mild sauce on the side. The tender meat just slid off the bones, add a little sauce or pour it on if you like. It tastes good with or without the sauce. The greens were tender and perfectly complimented the juicy ribs.  The pecan pies finished off the meal well with a swig of Chardonney. What a meal."

Seriously though, Phillip&#39;s BBQ is probably the best BBQ in LA. it might even be the best BBQ I&#39;ve ever had anywhere. Unfortunately, Phillip&#39;s is unable to open a location on the westside. Something about the excessive amounts of sweet smoke that pours out of their vents 24/7. Enough about the pity that they can&#39;t open a Phillip&#39;s on the westside...

The links, the links are my favorite. I get em spicy and devour them like a famished beast. The beef ribs are quite fantastic, as long as you don&#39;t mind getting your face dirty (your hands get dirty no matter what, c&#39;mon folks it&#39;s real BBQ.) The tri-tip is also killer! 

I discovered Phillip&#39;s about 10 years ago. It&#39;s still a treat to go out there and indulge in some of the best, most tasty food that LA has to offer. All the Lamborghinis and Ferraris that you see at Mastro&#39;s...... They&#39;re only there because they would get shot at Phillip&#39;s. 

Seriously though Mastro&#39;s is way overrated. For the cost of two people there you could cater a whole feast from Phillip&#39;s and you could make errebody happy!"

Came in and ordered a &#34;soul special&#34;, that might not be the exact name, but it&#39;s close enough. I chose sliced beef as my entree; and mac n&#39; cheese and baked beans as the sides...for the most part, the food was excellent. Baked beans were good...not all that, though (I&#39;ll get yams next time). But that mac n&#39; cheese, though...the bomb!

They had a variety tray which included BBQ Chicken, Ribs, Rib Tips and Sausage (which was the obvious winner out of all the meats). We also enjoyed their potato salad, corn bread, and baked beans.

I know LA isn&#39;t famous for great BBQ, but it exists if you look for it  and Phillip&#39;s on Crenshaw turns out to be one of the city&#39;s gems. Less saucy than other BBQ joints, the meats are slathered in dry-rub style sauce that makes it a bit less goopy. And it&#39;s delicious. A must-eat place if you like BBQed meats... and do make sure you try the sausage if you have to choose just one of their offerings (but why choose just one when you can enjoy a wide variety?)."

The people working inside are on it. Getting orders out quick and making sure everything is in order. The lady taking the orders is extremely nice!  I enjoyed her pleasant attitude. The food though I have mixed reviews on. The BBQ was good. A hit of smokey wood chip taste and I chose the mild sauce. The chicken and beef slices were amazing. The baby back ribs I was a bit disappointed. Hardly any meat on them which for the price I was expecting a bit more of a meaty selection. Everything is covered in sauce and I mean COVERED in sauce so if you&#39;re not a big sauce person you won&#39;t like that.

Well..... at least I made it here. The question is when or if I will make it back. 

The food is ok. I&#39;m gonna leave it at ok because if I do decide to patron the place in the future, maybe the ok will go to good. Maybe! I just wasn&#39;t satisfied on the level I planned on being after reading and hearing all the hype.

First off the restaurant is going to lure you in because it smells so good. Then you may draw back at little once your inside due to the long lines. But If you just troop it out you will be fine. Made it to the counter to place the order. I decided to order the beef rib dinner. The sides I chose were BBQ beans and potato salad. Oh and a side of corn on the cob. The sides were good. Corn on the cob was the highlight of my plate. The ribs were a bit tuff and dry. The sauce was minimal and didn&#39;t have too much taste at all. Pretty bland. 

Now I&#39;m not gonna shut them down completely and not recommend this place. Because what might be &#34;ok&#34; BBQ may be &#34;epic&#34; BBQ to others. I will probably go back but after trying out some of the other places. So I will see you in the future Phillips on Crenshaw."

I really wanted to like this BBQ spot. It had all the makings of a legit BBQ spot... it&#39;s a small shack spewing smoke, centrally located in the heart of the hood, right off the 10 freeway and Crenshaw. They were playing some dope soulful music when we drove up.

Maybe I&#39;m just too much of a BBQ connoisseur - I travel a lot, and I&#39;ve had some pretty amazing BBQ in hole in the wall spots in Texas, different parts of the south, and even in Detroit. Maybe I expect too much... but hell, I know two places in the San Fernando Valley and one place run by a Chinese dude in Glendora that schools Phillips. Such a disappointment.

The pulled pork sandwich was good. Super soft, flavorful and chewy. 4 stars for that.

Their BBQ chicken was dry like old white people humor. The meat itself was essentially flavorless, and just doused in bbq sauce. This is NOT how good bbq spots do it. The meat itself should have mad flavor, and the sauce should complement the smoky, spicy meat. So bummed. Gotta subtract points for that. Let&#39;s move on. 

The collard greens were chopped super small. It made me wonder if they used frozen greens from Costco. I&#39;m used to super meaty flavored greens, with some kind of meat tossed in the pot of greens as it simmers slowly, creating a meaty, flavorful broth. The greens I had last night were nothing like that. Sad. 

The mac and cheese was aiiight. Not anything to write home about. It wasn&#39;t bad.

The sweet potato pie and peach cobbler looked like they were mass produced and purchased from a grocery store, wrapped in plastic. Again, not a good look. My friend ordered both anyway, just to try them. I didn&#39;t want to waste my time or money.

I still think Roger&#39;s BBQ and Hardy&#39;s Meat Market/Texas Best BBQ in the San Fernando Valley are better than this spot. Mom&#39;s BBQ in Van Nuys is pretty decent too. Country BBQ Chicken &amp; Ribs in Glendora do chicken &amp; beef ribs well too... cooked by a Chinese guy that looks like Mr Ferley from Three&#39;s Company.

I&#39;m down to come back to Phillips sometime to give them another try. Next time I&#39;ll try the tri tip and beef ribs. I wouldn&#39;t waste time on the chicken again."

The only thing is, It only had two pieces of Ribs, One chicken thigh and a couple of sliced hot links AND WE PAID $18.00 FOR THAT!!! The sides are in very small bowls too!! How do they expect a whole family to share on that??? It looks like it&#39;s worth $10. Good for two people probably if those two people are not big eater. I am disappointed."

She had us cracking up, was super helpful, and downright a pleasure. 

The food however, was another story all together. we ordered the baby backs, mixed sauce, macaroni and cheese, greens and corn on the Cobb. The meat actually might have been good either without the sauce or with a better sauce all together. My advice, is for you to order your sauce on the side. Macaroni and cheese had too much garlic powder (wasn&#39;t real garlic), not that if put garlic of any sort in my macaroni and cheese. The greens could damn near embalm a person with the amount of vinegar it had going on. 

I didn&#39;t personally try the corn on the cobb but my wife did and she spit it out. She said it was nasty and tasteless. So it was a miss for us. Though if we are ever in town and craving bbq we may go for the meat alone without the sauce."

To date, this is the rocking-est BBQ I have had in LA, ever. Every time I&#39;m back after a long stint away, Phillips is a must. I don&#39;t even make it home...I just eat it in my parked car.

You see all manner of people roll through--from khakis to full suits, this place attracts a devoted and wide following, and it&#39;s because they consistently serve up awesome food with all the fixins.

It&#39;s not fancy. It&#39;s not complicated. But it&#39;s real good.

Anyone who thinks that Wonderbread and BBQ aren&#39;t soulmates has obviously been brainwashed by the overly health-conscious. Anyone who hasn&#39;t crunched on the delectable rib tips and coated themselves in the sauce is seriously missing out. And anyone who hasn&#39;t smelled that sweet smoker smell a block away and felt their food-senses tingle needs to head to Phillips right away."

This is as good as it gets!  So far I have been here three times and I will continue to come back for my pork BBQ rib tip cravings.  Phillips believes in giving quality over quantity.  What this means is you will get 1 pound of rib tips, but it will be quality rib tips with meat and cut in small manageable portions.  Unlike MOST other BBQ&#39;s places where you order rib tips and you get these monster size tips with 90% bone/gristle and 10% meat.  Really?  And that is exactly what happens at most other places, but thank God Phillips does not believe in that terrible practice.  

TIP: If you&#39;re originally from the Midwest like me, do not go in there looking for french fries with your BBQ.  I didn&#39;t know until I moved to Los Angeles that fries and BBQ are a Midwest thing.  Good thing is, I ordered a pound of rib tips and I got exactly one pound of tips.  The mild sauce is good but the mixed should be bottled and sold in stores, I love it...All credit/debt cards accepted......good.. I don&#39;t carry cash."

The sauce isn&#39;t that sweet but the meat is perfectly smoked and seasoned. The portions are huge. The macaroni salad is very, very good and so is the corn. I still don&#39;t care for the beans, and the peach cobbler is terrible. I wish they would add lunch, especially for the rib tips. I&#39;ve been here several times and have not been disappointed by the bbq. The rib tips are on point, not too fatty or bony. I&#39;ve tried other places and I really like this one!

 We came all the way from North Hollywood in hopes to find a good BBQ spot. The line was long, and nothing but 2 fans blowing above you just to keep the flies buzzing around your head and legs. After a long wait, we made our order with an EXTREMELY RUDE LADY in the window. She was impatient and mean! No customer service skills what so ever. ( I thought it was just us, until I saw she TREATED everyone like that.)  After about 45 mins, my fiancee and I received our food from another rude person, this time a guy, who snatches your ticket and then calls the next number. ( A simple thank you goes a long way) 

OK to the food: We had the &#34;Soul Special&#34; with Pork ribs, mac and cheese, baked beans, corn and cornbread. The BBQ sauce had no flavor, and the ribs were mediocre at best! The sauce tasted like fancy ketchup. The baked beans tasted like they were drowned in tomato sauce and sugar, the corn had clearly been frozen, and the cornbread was the most stale cornbread I have ever had in my life!

Save your time, don&#39;t buy their overpriced BBQ. You can find better BBQ in a middle school at lunch time, and at least the lunch ladies would be nice!"

They really do a fine preparation of a selections of meats: beef, pork or baby back ribs, chicken, links, sliced beef and rib tips which are so good they&#39;re often sold out of them. 

You get a choice of hot or mixed sauce (mild + hot) which allows you to customize your heat preference. The hot is actually pretty hot so beware.

The sides are good, maybe not great, I like the slaw and beans, I was not a fan of the mac and cheese however which seems to be made with Miracle Whip. Your meal comes with 2 slices of white Wonder Bread which is kinda funny but traditional for this kind of food.

The food isn&#39;t terribly cheap, it&#39;s about $15 for your choice of BBQ meat, 2 sides and bread. It IS a lot of food and will most likely provide a second meal later.

When you call in an order, it&#39;s always waiting when you arrive. The people who work there are really nice. They see all the Hipsters moving into their neighborhood and seem more than happy to accommodate them. 

Phillips is almost always quite busy with patrons waiting, but this is a good thing right? That means their food is a hit."

I felt like I was back in Italy.  When my food arrived through Postmates delivery, I immediately tasted the focaccia with onions. Wow!! It is exactly like my local bakery in Perugia, Italy would make. I am in love with this place. 

The mushroom ravioli with walnut sauce is spectacular as well as the Caprese panini. If you&#39;ve never tried the Galvanina Organic Fruit Sparkling Lemon beverage from Italy that they sell, you&#39;re missing out. 

Now let&#39;s talk about desserts. Their Torta Della Nonna is literally the most perfect cake. It&#39;s not too sweet and full of Lemon custard. It&#39;s to die for. The Apple tart is yet another winner. Once again, just enough sugar. Add that buttery dough and fresh apples and you get a mouth full of heaven. I also found the mini cannolis, puff pastry, and plain biscotti spot on. 

The owners Mickey and Ambra are clearly masters at Italian baking as well as panini and pasta making. They also embody warm, friendly Italian hospitality. They import their flour from Italy, along with other key ingredients. If you&#39;ve ever been to Italy and eaten there, you&#39;ll understand why this is necessary. The ingredients we have here just don&#39;t compare because Italians have a reverence and respect for food and tradition that is unparalleled.

I don&#39;t even like coffee; I chugged that mocha. It&#39;s foamy, light, nutty and yummmy! So easy to drink. Not too sweet, not bitter, smooooooooth. SO GOOD!!

The cappuccino was the best I&#39;ve ever tasted! It was strong, not acidic, not burnt, not milky. PERFECT. SO GOOD!!

Ever been to Sullivans in New York? The pizza and bread is comparable to, if not better than Sullivans. The focaccia definitely rivals the bianca. Rosemary chewy potato-ey goodness. As soon as it gets near your face you&#39;re hit with a wave a rosemary. A bite...then brick wall to your face of rosemary and olive oil. The rosemary is not just sprinkled on it, it&#39;s infused. It&#39;s all flavor! There&#39;s definitely potato in that focaccia, as it should be. It&#39;s fluffy, chewy, crisp on the edges...dimpled with wet pockets of olive oil. SO GOOD!!!

The margarita was good but the cheese gets hard and unappetizing quickly. It&#39;s good if you&#39;re a cheese pizza lover. I like prefer mine without cheese so the sardinia is perfect for me. It&#39;s the same crisp thin crust but with tomato, herbs and black olives. I rate this pizza a 4.5/5 only because the focaccia is so damn amazing.

All the flatbreads are 5 a piece but they&#39;re huge slices and he cuts them in half. Basically you&#39;re getting 2 pizzas so it&#39;s worth it. Plus they are delicious. If you don&#39;t eat much bread, you can definitely share 1 serving. You don&#39;t want to share the focaccia tho, trust me.

They have bomboloni here! It&#39;s basically brioche speckled with lemon zest, traditionally filled with custard and fried like a doughnut. Then it&#39;s dusted with powdered sugar. It&#39;s an italian doughnut. But lighter and more refined than the american doughnut. This was ok. Maybe the oil wasn&#39;t hot enough, it was a little greasy and heavy. I prefer it to be lighter. But a good representation of bomboloni. I&#39;m just happy I found it in LA. 

I did the 3 dessert check in on yelp. It&#39;s 3 tiny cookies. Goes good with coffee. I believe these are homemade as well. They were excellent. My fave was the chocolate sandwich one. Whoever is baking here is very, very good.

Must try everything on the menu. Definitely order a coffee, definitely get the focaccia. I can&#39;t wait to come back for dessert. I saw tiramisu, a berry pie, a lemon pie, TIRAMISU!!, assorted cookies, cannoli with candied fruit (which looked scrumptious), tiramisu and tiramisu. I might try the tiramisu next time, not sure.

Off street metered parking, otherwise free parking in the back off Grammercy. Tiny place inside, a few outdoor seats. Maybe my most favorite unexpected find in Thai Town. Get here.

Service was good. The guy, who might be the owner and baker, was too busy to chat but he was alone. Love the small business model. This guy knows what he&#39;s doing."

I&#39;ve actually only had a special Wild Berry Tart once when I had stopped in and chatted with the owner Mickey, but I was informed by them recently that they no longer are going to serve this anymore which is too bad because it was pretty tasty. I had a cup of espresso once too and it was smooth, very authentic.

Do you like cheese sandwiches???

If yes, you are going to love this place! Just think, a toasty panini in your hand with thinly sliced meats and the softest cheeses ever!

They have like 20+ panini sandwiches to choose from and they even have a board on the wall that lists the TOP FIVE SANDWICHES ordered. This includes...

1)Parma ham and mozzarella 
2)caprese- tomato and mozzarella 
3)roast beef, provolone 
4)turkey, provolone 
5) salame sopressata, smoked provolone 

I ordered the Parma ham and mozzarella. The ham was super thinly sliced, which I absolutely love, and the mozzarella was so fresh and soft. I also ordered a side salad with balm aspic vinaigrette and everything was just delicious!!!

Ahhh so good. Can I really try them all???

Smart community loving Italian owners break away from the crowd with their warmth and love for traditional food. They&#39;re humble space lends it&#39;s self to the busy streets of Hollywood. Don&#39;t be fooled, be wowed by their instant &#34;at home&#34; feel... And the food!!!

The owners take pride in their culture. All flour is shipped from Italy making each bite more authentic. Their coffee&#39;s, latte&#39;s, cappuccino&#39;s... is by far superior than the norm and what you would expect from a 5 Star Place. It&#39;s definitely worth a few visits!

We were eating inside the bistro, so we WERE clients! Then we were told &#34;the restroom is too close to the oven, we cannot let you use it&#34;

Hi Ambra.  Thank you for your reply.  I really appreciate you trying to make this right. 

I want to be clear that I was not looking to write a bad review for your place. It was my first time there, and I saw all of the wonderful reviews you had on Yelp and was quite excited.  

Also, I did not write my review until I left your restaurant.  I did photograph the sandwich so I could add it to my review. 

You are correct. I should have said something to your worker. I don&#39;t know who your husband is or if he is an owner.  I should have spoken up but I was honestly so upset and felt ripped off.  

Again, thank you so much for writing back. It shows you really do care and I would love to come back soon and give it another chance.  Thank you!"

The restaurant is small, humble yet loud and confident in what they do. You walk in and see Italian flag in various places, pictures of famous Italians, and THE GIANT MENU. You&#39;re greeted by the friendly owners who are proud of their food and being Italian! This place reminds me of Little Italy in San Diego. 

My turkey provolone pesto panini was only $7.95 with a side salad for $0.75. The best part about this whole experience is the flavor in the panini is subtle yet hearty enough for it to be a satisfying meal that you WOULD go out of your way to get and it is NOT greasy. The salad is a simple greens with balsamic vinegrette - can&#39;t go wrong with it to complement your panini.

If you want good authentic italian style pizza, there&#39;s no better place than I Panini Di Ambra. Seriously. One bite and it literally took me back to the days of roaming the streets of Rome with a slice of pizza in hand soaking in the italian experience.

It was a few hours before the show at the Pantages was to start so we decided to grab a quick bit to eat in Hollywood. We came by 30 mins before they were about to close shop so a few items on their menu were sold out. So we ended up getting a slice of sausage pizza and a slice of parma ham. The pizza came with a side of greens dressed in this light vinaigrette and served on a cutting board and silverware. Yup, you read that right, fork and knives for pizza.  Blasphemy, right??

The owner was gracious and friendly and since we were the only ones in the restaurant, we struck up a short conversation with him. As we finished the meal and I make my way to pay, I saw some chocolate covered cream puffs and ordered 4 to go. I commented how good the pizza was and how it reminded me of the pizza I had in Rome. The owner smiled and replied &#39;That&#39;s how he hoped people would respond to his food&#39;. Not only that, he gave me 2 extra cream puffs and told us to enjoy &#39;The Book of Mormon&#39; and with that, we left the restaurant with a greater appreciation for this wonderful restaurant with impeccable service and good ol&#39; authentic Italian food."

This is probably the first truly authentic Italian eatery I have found so far in Los Angeles. Ambra, the owner, is from Milan, and she brought quite a bit of her culture with her. He paninis are absolutely delicious. They&#39;re as fresh as can be. She also serves gelato!!! It&#39;s fucking great. She&#39;s also really sweet and nice. 

The shop is small and quaint. About four tables inside, but she keeps two outside with umbrellas. 

Cheapest panini is going to cost you $6.50, up to $10 or $11 depending on what you add. She also does side salads with almost everything, which are good too!

Well worth a trip from your neighborhood. Always puts a smile on my face.

Oh PS--no bathroom."

The owner here is just oozing Sicilian and is extremely amiable. He invited us to have a seat and grab whatever drinks we wanted. However, note that you do have to pay for the drinks. My crony and I grabbed some paninis. They came with a small salad which featured a simply scrumptious vinegar-based dressing that sent a wonderful sensation throughout my digestive tract. So I&#39;ve eaten at several panini places before... And as delicious as paninis are, they never have me feeling stuffed. This was the only panini place where my $11 meal made me feel absolutely full. I love it."

The ambiance is truthfully ghetto but authentic. A genuine Italian experience. 

The owner is personable and extremely hospitable. Asked for his recommendations, and he deemed the mozzarella as &#34;exquisite.&#34; So I went for the caprese panini (mozzarella, tomato, basil, and oregano), which was MONEY. I have never in my life thoroughly enjoyed a vegetarian meal. This one was a party in my mouth and the mozzarella truly is divine! The parma ham &amp; mozzarella (with tomato and rucola) panini is spot on as well. Nomz.

I have also tried the pizza margarita, which was incredibly flavorful, chewy with a hint of crispy. It came with a side salad. Loved the balsamic vinaigrette and the freshness of my leafy greens. Everything about this place is fantastic. Thank God for delicious food!!"

This is family owned and operated bakery not fast food. So relax, take your time and enjoy the food.  The pizza is amazing.  The  namesake panini are great. the salads are a great complement to any of the bready lunch things. The sweet croissants go great with with the cappuccino which is as good as any in Milan.  They use lots of organic and local foods alongside things they import from Italy; not because its trendy, just because that is how food is done in Italy.

Hot wings may be my favorite bad decision food (any vehicle for bleu cheese dressing, really) so this place intrigued me. Putting a healthy spin on a classic bar food seemed to legitimize my completely sober decision to eat hot wings for dinner. And they were delicious! I opted for carrot fries over potato wedges because I was feeling adventurous (and the cashier recommended them to me). I dislike carrots and I consider French fries sacred, so I was skeptical.

I used the online ordering system for pickup, took about 30 mins from time of order to ready time. I ordered:

-12 pc chickpea wings (5/5)
I actually requested for these to be plain, with buffalo sauce on the side, and extra crispy but got none of that. They had the sauce on them and they were not crispy at all, so it was too spicy which is why I wrote in for the sauce to be on the side. It&#39;s all good though because it was still really really good. They don&#39;t taste like chicken so don&#39;t expect them to, they just taste good. Worth a try. 

-potato wedges (4/5)
These were slightly stale but had really good flavor, I enjoyed them a lot. 

-agave vanilla cream soda (5/5) 
I don&#39;t ever drink soda, only soda I&#39;ll ever drink is Vanilla Coke or a good cream soda. And this... is an amazing cream soda. Seriously amazing, took this meal over the top for me.

The seasonings and dipping sauces are endless...if only I could get over my obsession for the Sesame Ginger, I could explore the other flavors. I&#39;m sure they&#39;re just as bomb!

*Note: If you check in, you can sample their signature LBW, the seasoning on this one is kickin&#39; good. If you like spicy wings, try the LBW. 

The guys working here are super cool. Always nice, always smiles, always ready to help you with selections...and, they call you by name, a real acknowledgment. Excellent customer service. 

I love the overall vibe, always good music and very interesting people coming through here. My first visit was for their Yelp Gets Baked event on National 420 day, and that&#39;s pretty much the kind of vibe here all the time. Very chill, and at times funny. 

If you haven&#39;t been here yet, take the drive...you won&#39;t be disappointed. Lastly, don&#39;t come through here expecting to share, because one taste of these wings, and you&#39;re sure to get crazy greedy. GET YOUR OWN! :-)"

Their options are pretty straight forward. Hubbs and I ordered 10 wings for $13. We got the garlic Parmesan &amp; Rosemary. They were supposed to be mild but i did not taste any kick to it.

We also ordered the kale salad which was pretty good. Oh yeah if you check in you get a free drumstick."

Packers played at 530 today so we stopped in to grab some wings &#34;quick&#34; before we went home. there was no one less in line at all so we thought we would give it a whirl.

We stood outside at the window for avout 5 minutes and no one acknowldeged us. So we wrnt inside. We werent greeted inside either and after waiting a few minutes we were helped. I agree with a earlier post that I too told the cashier we had never been here and he offered no suggestions or tried to explain anything. 

We struggled through the order and finally paid. We waited for about 20 minutes for our order to be ready. 

When we got the food home we popped it in the oven to keep it warm. Everything was yummy. We got the Ranch rub and their famous LBW rub. Delish!!!! The baked wedges left a little to be desired but were good. all the sauces claim to be homemade and were all good; ranch, blue cheese, and sour cream. 

we would go back again especially since these are a &#34;healthy&#34; alternative to fried wings. I think I might try them xcrispy next time and hope for better service."

Super random but the food is really good and filling. It&#39;s also a little pricey for what you get. 
I paid around $11 for 4 strips and wedges. It was amazing with the Parmesan garlic sauce, but not worth $11. 
The guy at the register on 9/15/2016 didn&#39;t provide the best service. While I waited for my friend, the music on the stereo mysteriously got louder and louder. When we were about to order, we told him it was our first time and did he offer any suggestions or tips? Nope. You could just tell he didn&#39;t really care. He barely spoke to us at all and when the food came out, my friends fries were burnt smh
So, overall, I would give this place 3 stars. Pretty good food, but not good enough for the price and service you get. Just being honest."

I am a huge fan of baked things instead of fried foods, so when I heard that this place did everything baked, even the FRIES? I was all in! 

I was still impressed that everything here was not fried and the food was pretty decent. The arugula salad was something that I wasn&#39;t expecting from a wings place, but it was actually great quality and fresh tasting! 

Now let&#39;s talk about the boneless wings- I loved these bad boys, because they still had a nice crunch to it and it was just delicious. You can taste that they are not fried, because they weren&#39;t as greasy. 

The wings with the bones were also just as delicious - you get a nice crunch and flavor without all the oil. Impeccable I must say!

Excellent customer service. Literally every staff member with the Baked shirt had a smile and was ready to help. 

The food is delicious and high quality. I tried the drumsticks, wings, potato wedges, and even the juice selection. All great! I wanted something flavorful but not spicy making the parmesan garlic perfect for me.

I especially love their tables outside and how it is dog-friendly. I was expecting a longer wait given the event but was pleasantly surprised. They also have iPads to expedite orders.

Parking can be hard since its tandem but I do appreciate them having a free lot. If someone&#39;s blocking you or there&#39;s any kind of issue, just talk to the staff and they will gladly help.

Expensive like a rifle though but worth it. You can convince bill gates to give you a million dollars if you hand him a dozen of these wings. These guys need to take over all the wing spots so everyone can move away from the nasty wings out there and have real wings instead. That will save millions of chickens as well.

Inside, it smelled really nice - and not like fryers or grease. And, the place is clean and bright (being that it&#39;s on the corner of the street - it&#39;s a great locale). 

Patrick was at the register and told me the spiel about their baking everything and making it fresh. Tried the boneless tenders and 3 different sauces. Yum-a-rooo. So damn tasty. 

This is NOT fried crispy crunchy chicken that has that crackling breading. Instead, it&#39;s baked so the breading is crispy and tasty, but it&#39;s missing that super crispiness factor that you can only get when deep frying. And, that&#39;s OK, because these wings are still delicious and a really really good alternative. You can taste the freshness of the chicken - tender and moist. Yep, I said moist, deal with it. And the breading is really tasty and crunchy - it does actually stick to the chicken. Sauces are awesome - I prefer dipping rather than drenching. But you can have it any way. 

Definitely try this place when you want something delicious and crispy, but not as heavy and guilt-ridden as Popeyes."

I love anything with rosemary so I had to try the rosemary and Parmesan wings. He had lemon pepper. 
The customer service was excellent. Very attentive and polite. The wings were nice and hot when they first came to us!! It was hard resisting the temptation of taking the first bite but I had to wait for them to cool down a little. The Rosemary ones were nice and cheesy with lots of flavor! The lemon pepper was very lemony, but not too lemony  with peppery hints! I loved them both! Interested in trying their other flavors! They&#39;re nice and crispy too. They also have the option to make your wings extra crispy for 5 mins longer!!!!

Nothing is fried, hence the name and the food is muy delicioso. Everything is fresh, not frozen. I ordered the spicy BBQ boneless strips and the potato wedges with a side of BBQ sauce. I am a BBQ sauce lover and it most definitely met my standards, not to mention their sauces are made in house.

-lemon pepper was very flavorful and good
-didn&#39;t actually like the LBW infamous ones.. Couldn&#39;t really figure out what I should be tasting
-Loved their sesame ginger &amp; naked wings.
-Buffalo was too soggy for me

If you&#39;re a true wing fan (and why shouldn&#39;t you be?), you&#39;ll go broke trying to fill up here.  As for the baked thing; they do taste about as good as fried.  But maybe that&#39;s because they&#39;re finished on the stove in oil and sauce.  So what&#39;s your point?

The &#39;salads&#39; seem like someone opened up a bag of greens from Trader Joe&#39;s, poured a quarter of it into a cardboard bowl, and gave you dressing on the side.  Not impressive.

It falls into that category of specialty, boutique restaurants that take traditional American dishes to the next level. If you consider yourself a fan of chicken wings, this place is a must-have; the meat, sauces, and ingredients are all extraordinarily high quality, and it shows.

The chicken wings are tender, white meat that virtually fall off the bone; no gristle, &amp; no gross charred crispy bits or excessive amounts of grease. All of their sauces are seemingly made in house (I have no proof of this--but they are DEFINITELY not &#34;stock&#34; sauces purchased in bulk from a manufacturer), and have unique flavors that compliment the meat &amp; the fries--that&#39;s right, they provide (free of charge) their own unique dipping sauce for the fries, and I haven&#39;t quite pinpointed what it is yet, but it&#39;s kick-you-in-the-teeth delicious. The blue cheese (my personal preference over ranch, I have not tried their ranch) is creamy and smooth, and they provide you with plenty of it to coat your wings with. 

The venue itself is small and charming, and has the atmosphere of a 70&#39;s diner-meets-modern tattoo parlor. There is also outside seating. The service is quick and simple--you get your food in about 5 minutes."

Whether these are actually healthy I&#39;m not so sure about, but they are certainly healthier than other wings out there as they are baked, not fried and made with high quality ingredients (free range chicken, organic produce).  

We ordered from the Eat24 app while watching football, then completely devoured everything when it arrived (which is why I have no photos).

For 2 people:
1 pound of chicken wings, LBW Infamous recipe (Medium)
1/2 pound boneless chicken strips, Burning Jerk 
LBW Pickled Cucumbers 
LBW Potato Wedges
Arugula Side Salad
2 Organic Oogave Fountain Sodas
Total: $32 before delivery charge and tip

It was a lot of food, so I thought pretty reasonable for $32. Everything was very good, but note that your sauce/recipe selection is critical, as it&#39;s not just a dipping sauce for the side, but what the wings will actually be marinated in.  I liked the burning jerk, but it was a bit hot even for me to enjoy eating a large amount of.  On the other hand, the LBW Infamous Medium could have been spicier, so we should have opted for Hot on that one. It&#39;s all a matter of personal preference, but do take some time to think about what flavor you want your wings to be.  The sides were all great. I loved the potato wedges - very thick and great with ketchup (or without!)."

1) Parking was horrible, but what do you expect for being on Melrose so whatever I&#39;ll let that slide. 

2) The service was mediocre at best. From calling over the phone to ask about parking - Just very blunt. To going in and not even getting a &#34;Hello&#34; or any suggestions or help. When I asked about a suggestion the guy simply just said one flavor and acted bothered that I asked. It was me and my boyfriend&#39;s first time and the first impression wasn&#39;t friendly or helpful at all. 

3) Everything was self-service. Of course, we didn&#39;t know that until we were ready to order and weren&#39;t helped so we decided to touch the iPad machine on the counter and ordered ourselves. We ordered a drink and needed a drink cup but didn&#39;t know if we were allowed to grab the cup ourselves or needed to show the receipt or anything so I asked and, again, just a simple answer to grab the cup as if I should know that. 

At least he walked the food to us instead of having us pick it up. That was the least he could do. We had to put our trays away, which was fine. I mean, it was definitely a Wingstop feel but at least Wingstop gives great service. 

4) The food was okay. I didn&#39;t care for the ranch at all. It had a weird taste to it and I love wings with ranch so I had to eat them alone. Oh, and the dipping sauces you have to pay for as an extra fee. Not even one sauce was free. Flavor was fine. We got the Spicy BBQ and Buffalo chicken strips. I didn&#39;t like the texture. I&#39;m not sure if the wings were suppose to be that soft and soggy? It almost tasted like reheated wings. 
The potato wedges were probably the only thing that I cared for and even those were pretty soft. Oh, and the root beer was good. They had like specialty sodas, so if you don&#39;t know the flavors you just have to use the trial and error method. The root beer tastes like cream soda root beer. 

Positives: Potato wedges and root beer soda. 
Negatives: Customer service, service type, food, and parking. 

I&#39;m fine sticking to Wingstop."

love-baked-wings-los-angeles,Philip C.,xpaRMF2jJokBzrB3B3PLPw,"Los Angeles, CA",1,1,0,132,28,yN1udgKH-tMTmEAoohL5xg,3.0,2016-01-16,"I ordered for delivery and got the LBW wings, garlic/rosemary drumsticks, and potato wedges. Best thing was probably the potato wedges. simple but still really tasty. However, I can&#39;t really say the same about the chicken. Given that it&#39;s all baked, the sauce on the LBW came out really dry; plus they&#39;re also tiny pieces, about half the size I was expecting for the price. Same for the size of the drumsticks. The description made these seem huge! The garlic/rosemary definitely tasted more like Chinese hunan chicken somehow (Maybe I&#39;m craving it?). 

Overall, I really like what LBW is doing here, but the flavor really isn&#39;t there for me. Although there&#39;s no minimum delivery fee, the $6 delivery fee makes up for that. Not sure I&#39;d try again, if not for the potato wedges."

Came here after a groundlings show tonight and didn&#39;t realize they closed at 10. Patrick was really nice even though we walked in at 9:58pm. Didn&#39;t rush us and really made the experience great even though they were closing. Definitely will be back here!

Pros: great customer service
          Great drinks that are a lot healthier    than regular soda
           Baked wings 
           Good house sauce that came on the 
            Side 

Cons: Price it was pretty steep paid almost
           $14 for a basic meal
           Chicken wasn&#39;t crispy it was soggy 
            Because of the sauce
            I got the boneless rosemary chicken  I didn&#39;t like the flavor much
     
I think if I would have gotten bone in wings in a different flavor it would have been a different experience. The wings would probably not have been soggy, and the sesame flavor looked really good compared to what I ordered. It was a bit of a disappointment knowing this is a healthy alternative."

All natural everything, chicken is superb, I had their house chicken &amp; salad. The house spicy chicken fingers (boneless) were spicy with seasoning, not just a sauce with homemade &#34;fried chicken&#34; type of batter so that it didn&#39;t get all over. Like a spicy shake n bake.

They have homemade juices everyday, agave soda, &amp; boutique sodas too. Service is good, it&#39;s clean &amp; fun, great place to go before/after a Groundlings show :) 

Their portions are good too, I couldn&#39;t finish all my chicken. I&#39;m also a small girl though lol 

I also love their dipping sauces, also homemade. Love this place, I&#39;m going as many times as I can."

The chicken sandwich was amazing though! The sauce in it is so good. 

You can come to this wing place with your vegetarians friends which is great:)"

Baked wings that are done quickly, fresh, juicy, and great flavors.  I&#39;ve been here twice already in like one week.  I just discovered it on TUES and today is FRI and already went back.  It is usually busy so they have a good steady flow of customers, but there is never a wait.  The first time we went, it was around 920pm, and they close at 10pm and they were literally getting delivery orders at 10pm.  I went back today for lunch around 1pm ish and it was also busy, but not packed, but a good flow of customers.  We got the ranch rub, garlic parm and rosemary, fries, salad, and today I had them just make me some salt and pepper wings (not on menu) and that&#39;s what I will be asking for from now on.  Oh, we also got the sorta hot wings called LBW infamous or something.  They are not that hot and it is a dry rub.  I REALLY WISH THEY HAD TRADITIONAL HOT WINGS AND HOT WING SAUCE - THE WET kind.  They only seems to have ghost pepper hot or super hot etc.  They have really cool drinks/sodas.  Never saw those brands before.  And they have indoor and outdoor seating.  I wish it were closer to me.  The wings come out piping hot but the wait it only like 7-10 min.  Not sure how hot or what oven they have, but I wish I had one at home cause making wings at home takes me like 30-50 min.  Bleh.  LOL  Street parking only I think.  I may have spotted a tiny lot behind, but not sure if it&#39;s theirs or employees only.  They do have a restroom here which is good too."

Ordered this place for the office to-go. Their wings are so delicious, nice, crispy, light and fresh! I absolutely adore their Sesame Ginger sauce. I wish I had ordered more! 1/2 lb went so fast and I wasn&#39;t disgustingly full either!

I love the fact that they take pride in their product. Non hormone, cage free chicken. All house made sauces and dips! They even have vegan and vegitarian options! 

I will have to try their drumsticks and carrot fries next time, and will for sure eat it there.. the pick up was good but I want it hot and ready to eat right away."

We wee at a tattoo shop across the street and decided to grab a quick meal here while we were waiting. My lemon pepper drumstick was yummy but not phenomenal. BF ordered hot wings which he didn&#39;t really comment on (could be a good thing). Prices are reasonable and the menu looked like there is a lot of variety. I would definitely try this place again. Oh the the potato wedges were different and good.

I ordered spicy Bbq tenders( which wasn&#39;t spicy, tomato based sauce), naked chicken wings and potato wedges.

I ordered 1 lb tenders and they were marginal.  Just because they are baked, doesn&#39;t mean they are not doused in oil.  Wings were ridiculously greasy - like soggy so much oil... Maybe they put them in baking sheets with 3 inches of oil and baked them.  They were a let down. 

Ordered a side of carrot fries and was disappointed as well - bad texture and no flavor - breading was soggy and burnt (go figure - hard to do both but they managed to do it...) 

Wait staff was very nice and genuine - location is great, and what I expected.  Can&#39;t give it 1 star - but I probably won&#39;t be back."

Honestly, I do not mind that they are baked. The sesame ginger is my favorite so far - you can really taste a good blend of the flavors without it being over powered. Also loved the sides so far- the potato wedges feel a little cheesy, the carrot fries are a little sweet and the chickpea wings allow me to be a little gluttonous without too much guilt."

Even if you not in the mood, order, and you will be. Great mix of wings, drums and my favorite...flats. Ordered two flavors and wish we had ordered just the original.

I come from a traditional deep fried buffalo wing background and I was so much happier with my experience at Love Baked Wings. Do it all! I had the baked wings, boneless strips, and the vegan chickpea wings. All were delicious! 

It&#39;s tasty, healthy, cheap and well worth a visit. The owner and his staff are incredibly friendly and accommodating. Right on Melrose with a cool interior, outdoor seating, and it&#39;s CLEAN, very clean. Please support these guys! You&#39;ll be happy you did, and so will your body! 

My favorites:
-Burning Jerk Chickpea Wings 
-Garlic Parm and Rosemary Boneless Strips
-Sesame Ginger Baked Wings
-Carrot Sticks (like sweet potato fries but 1000x better/healthier)
-Red Pepper Ketchup/Sweet Chili Sour Cream (all sauces made from scratch) 
-Plus Baked Snicker Doodle Cookies (gluten-free)

I&#39;ll be back soon! Thanks Mike!"

I&#39;ve had wings from here and wings from there, but never have I ever had a baked  wing that actually rivals the flavor and experience I&#39;ve grown to love and expect from traditional deep fried wings. But here I am , a self proclaimed wing purest, thoughly enjoying oven baked wings!! 
-Wings plump and juicy
- flavor on point 
-and the service, well let me just say that after waiting in line behind a particularaly rude customer I was expecting to be written off, when it was my turn to order I was pleasantly surprised by how friendly and helpful the cashier was. Having worked in the service myself, I know just how important it is to be genuine and this young blonde cashier was just that. I think her name was megan or melissia I&#39;m not sure, but she gave me her honest opinion and recomendations which I really appreciate in a server.

Turns out I love baked wings! I highly recommend it to anyone who is into wings!

And to the rude customer in front of me... quick being a dick buddy. Not the smartest move  to insult the people who handle you&#39;re food. Props to the cashier who handled that d-bag like a pro... I would have lost my cool...."

Walking in the place has a an outside bbq patio vibe. The menu is tacked on the wall and is simple to understand. I ordered the spicy bbq wings and the potato wedges. Other reviewers raved about these so I figured give it a try. At first bite of the wings I wasn&#39;t impressed to be honest the chicken was kinda hard to chew. The wedges were different seem like they battered it in somethin.. I feel like this place is a force. I mean if you gonna do baked wings they should&#39;ve been better in my opinion.

However. Lets have a talk about your pickles, Love Baked Wings. You need some help with those.

The wings were pretty tiny, but they tasted decent considering that they&#39;re baked. One of my coworkers is vegetarian, and she seemed to enjoy her vegan chickpea wings as well.

For being baked, the wings were surprisingly okay. The Parmesan was a by dry however and the wings with bones were VERY skinny. We also tried the hot sauce wings and it was pretty delicious. 

The potato wedges were particularly delicious, crispy and flavorful on the outside with the proper amount of potato on the inside.

OVERALL: exceeded expectations, tasted healthy, but disappointed with how little meat there was on the wings with bones"

Either way, very friendly staff, informative about their menu items and it was a clean establishment as far as the eyes could see.  I like the fact that they serve Oogave drinks as well instead of traditional Sodas, I was put onto that brand a few years back when they sponsored one of my skateboarding events in Venice. The baked wings were a good portion for the cost, the flavor was on point, and I got two try two of their recipes. 

I&#39;ll definitely be back soon, and if you&#39;ve not been here - you should check it out. Great addition to the block / melrose.

I love baked wings and make my own frequently. However, I ended up quite disappointed. First of all, $30 for 2 orders of wings and a side is pricey. I have had much better for much less. My biggest issue (besides the price) was the lack of flavor. We had one order of ranch and one order of garlic parm/rosemary. We couldn&#39;t tell which was which because neither had much flavor. The also wasn&#39;t a lot of crispness to the wings. Once you got into the actual meat it was so bland, not that the skin was much better. Blah. I like flavor! On a positive note, I asked for a side of ghost pepper sauce to try and that was great! I also had a side of the cucumbers which were also good. So $35 later I enjoyed a side of ghost pepper sauce and cucumber side. Sad because I waned so badly to like you Love Baked Wings. Irritated."

My husband had the boneless strips and potato wedges. We both really liked what we had. I was really curious to see how chickpea wings would taste. And no, they didn&#39;t taste like real wings but they were good and you got a lot of food for your money. And everything on the menu but the sandwich bread and croutons is gluten-free, which for someone like me is amazing!"

I definitely wouldn&#39;t order your wings with a sauce, go for the dry rubs. The sauce makes the wings slimy and soggy. The rubs however are great. Also didn&#39;t enjoy the potato wedges or the rude blonde with the nose ring behind the counter. I probably wouldn&#39;t come back .... Maybe I&#39;ll try a different location."

I love wings and am not the hardest judge of them as they&#39;re kind of hard to mess up. However, these are probably the least impressive wings I&#39;ve ever had short of the frozen ones you buy at Ralph&#39;s. I had Lemon Pepper and the LBW flavor, both of which were mediocre at best. I don&#39;t really like leaving negative feedback but a 4.5 for this place is completely unjustified."

I&#39;ve tried everything on the menu and it all rips. Yet I deny them a fifth star for missing a couple no-brainer options. They claim their &#34;infamous&#34; flavor their version of a buffalo sauce, yet far from the tangy, vinegary spice everyone loves. Add a true buffalo. Ain&#39;t that hard. Secondly, have at least one option with NO spice, for the KIDS. Even the &#34;mild&#34; is too spicy for my 7 year old. Kids are likely the biggest group of chicken strip consumers in the world. Step to it!"

When you have an amazing chef with a mission of bringing great food to the masses, you just can&#39;t go wrong! My hungry group of USC boys devoured 6lbs. of wings...we had to try each flavor! Everything down to the sauce (special ketchup was my favorite) is special and full of flavor! I have so many allergies and I was able to satisfy my foodie palate just fine!! The potatoes, carrot fries and pickles were so good I did&#39;t even get to try the salads...although I saw how beautiful they looked as they were being packed up for another pick up order! The favorites were the gluten free buffalo tenders, ranch wings, jerk chicken, and sesame ginger, although the other flavors were also super yummy!"

My boyfriend and I came here last night for dinner. We ordered a bit of everything... drumsticks, wings, pork riblets, a salad, pickles, and CARROT FRIES. YOU GUYS THE CARROT FRIES ARE SO GOOD ALL CAPS

I love the concept, classic American comfort food done with an emphasis on quality, health, creativity, and flavor. It&#39;s something a lot of restaurants try to achieve in LA, and most end up missing the mark. This place really nails it. 

I was impressed by the care, attentiveness, and thought that went into the menu and food preparation. First and most importantly, everything was delicious. I wasn&#39;t disappointed by a single thing I ordered. The food was incredibly fresh, clean tasting, and packed with flavor. The owner told me that nearly everything is made in house from the gluten free flour base for the AMAZING CARROT FRIES to the pickles. They blend and make all their own spices and sauces as well. One of the things I loved most about this meal was how I felt walking away from it. We ate a lot... I mean a lot. I have a sensitive tummy and usually come away from a large meal out feeling full in an uncomfortable way, the &#34;I need to walk this fullness and gross feeling off&#34; kind of way. Leaving this meal, I felt satisfied and energized. That was a great surprise and a hallmark of how clean and healthy the food is. 

The staff was attentive and all smiles. The owner and chef very personable and great to talk to.  The thoughtful layout stood out to me as well. There&#39;s a walk up window on the street to order from in addition to the counter inside. At the counter inside, there&#39;s a self order pad set up so people can bypass standing in a line if they know what they want. Really smart. 

And 

CARROT FRIES people! Get them with the blue cheese sauce."

I tried the Buffalo wings and the Jamaican jerk flavored wings and they were both excellent! (get both well done! For some crispyness) I also had the carrot fries since one of the employees recommended them and omg they blew my mind.  They were so tasty and tasted better than sweet potatoe fries. (Make sure you get a side of the sweet chili sour cream to dip the carrots!) def coming back here soon.

It is located off Alameda closer to 115th St. in the Santana Tires and Auto Glass parking lot. That&#39;s where the entrance is located.

Get the tocho tacos! They are $3.50 each, but sooo worth it! Tocho tacos come with beef, shrimp, cheese and a yummy sauce inside! You can get it without the sauce, but why would you? It&#39;s amazing with the sauce. I also ordered the shrimp taco which was also delish, but the tocho taco was my favorite! 

They offer a variety of seafood concoctions from tacos to tostadas and more. Everything was fresh and flavorful!"

I started off with a shrimp ceviche tostada and a chichi taco. The &#34;chichi taco&#34; is a stingray taco. Yes stingray! I highly recommend that you try it. I&#39;m pretty sure this is the only place around that sells sting ray. 

Mariscos Tocho&#39;s sauce left me wanting more so I ordered a &#34;taco tocho.&#34;This taco is generously filled with love; carne asada, shrimp, and cheese all slowly charbroiled in a corn tortilla. The crunchiness of the tortilla and the concussion of flavors felt like heaven in my mouth. Again, the kick of thier special sauce left me wanting more! This is a must have here.

Can also add jalape√±os (bit salty so choose the ones that aren&#39;t coated with salt), onions, and extra limes if you like the acidity are offered at the self service bar.

Ordered a combo that came with fish and shrimp tacos along with rice and beans. The side dishes are pretty standard, nothing note worthy. Had the salsa huicho hot sauce for the first time here.

Cheap, good and close to home?? Sounds like a good plan right. We came on a Wednesday around 630pm and there was a line out the door wrapping around the street. The line moves pretty slow - we waited about 45min ish before we ordered and got our food. 

The restaurant itself is pretty old and rundown. There is seating indoors and outdoor but neither option is the cleanest. My recommendation is getting it to go and eating it at home peacefully with no flies or bugs trying to come at you and your food.

As for the food, it wasn&#39;t bad but it wasn&#39;t great. Since it was Wednesday, we got their $0.99 fish tacos, shrimp quesadilla, and campechana cocktail. It didn&#39;t take too long for the food to come out. First one out was the campechana and it was average. The fish and seafood wasn&#39;t the freshest but that was to be expected. I did like the flavor and that they loaded it up with avocado. The fish tacos were not bad. Pretty crispy and flavorful. Shrimp quesadilla was the best out of all the options.

They have a condiment bar with lemons, pickled and spicy onions and jalape√±os. Although the condiment bar was delicious, it was not the cleanest or most hygienic place to get food.

Afterward, my GF and her friend had a pretty bad stomach ache but I didn&#39;t. I guess I lucked out... or I&#39;m used to it. I think its worth a try, but I wouldn&#39;t come back. The food didn&#39;t blow me away and I am not gonna wait in line at a janky spot."

Parking is often difficult and the area isn&#39;t the greatest but if you can look past these things, you&#39;ll be in for a treat. 


FOOD
Fish tacos - they do a good job frying the fish 
Shrimp Quesadilla - perfectly melted cheese along with a good amount of plump shrimp
Rice and Beans - not a big fan of these. Both were very basic. 
Condiment Bar - lemons, chilies, onions. You won&#39;t find any salsa here but they do have some bottles of hot sauce...


AMBIENCE 
The inside of the restaurant is very simple. There are only several tables but you can find several more outside. It&#39;s common to have solicitors come by in attempts to sell you things like cookies and candy. Outside, you will notice that the area isn&#39;t the greatest.  For example, while I was walking back to my car today, I saw a guy tagging the window of a neighboring business. 


SERVICE
Good, friendly service. Order at the front and then wait for your order number to be called and pick up your food at the ceviche counter.


PARKING
Not that easy. Small parking lot; limited street parking."

We actually drove right by this place as we were running an errand and it&#39;s funny because we actually said to each other &#34;that place must have bomb food because there&#39;s a line&#34;. It wasn&#39;t later after we were driving to Tacos Baja Ensenada on a recommendation that we realized it was actually the same place! Meant to be. The restaurant is a hole in the wall and probably a local favorite. There was a line when we got there and there was still a line by the time we left so I&#39;m guessing they just have a line all the time. It does go by fairly quick though so that&#39;s a plus. Also the restaurant is small and it doesn&#39;t really look all that hygienic but the food is so good that it doesn&#39;t really matter so I suggest checking it out. 

We ordered the Baja&#39;s Burrito (Fish, Shrimp, beans, rice, cabbage, tomato, onions, cilantro, cream &amp; salsa), two fish tacos and the Shrimp Ceviche Tostada (diced shrimp vs whole shrimp). This was A LOT of food for us mainly because the burrito is ENORMOUS. I got through maybe half before calling it quits but it is very good. They are very generous with the seafood in this burrito so you are not paying for just rice and beans at all. The Fish Tacos were also some of the best fish tacos I&#39;ve veer had! They had this fabulous sauce on it and once again...they were generous with the amount of fish. This makes me very happy. The best thing I ate that day was actually the tostada. It was probably my first time eating a tostada like this and I could have made a meal out of this alone. It was so fresh and so delicious that I couldn&#39;t stop eating it.

The parking lot is very small so we had to street park it. It might be a struggle during peak hours but well worth the effort. The best part was that our meal didn&#39;t cost much at all! In fact it was cheaper than we expected! I really enjoyed our meal here and wouldn&#39;t mind coming back at all. Check it out! Believe the hype. 5/5"

She is all you could wish for in a woman (long line of suitors waiting to have a taste of her, great personality, latin flavor, and looks that make me keep coming back to her). This establishment known for their seafood selections, is hands down the best fish taco place in Los Angeles.

Setting: In east LA but in a fairly clean and non gang related area. The restaurant inside is crowded but make sure you pick up some tahin coated peppers, and limes. Water is served complimentary inside by the cashier.

Wednesday: $1 fish tacos and the wait for it is about 25-30 minutes but it&#39;s so worth it. To me waiting for food is like waiting for the right girl, you don&#39;t want it to be easy but worth the struggle and the wait. I found that 4 tacos is the ideal amount to get full but really you can go up to 6 before your stomach begins to leak.

Coming at peak dining hours is pretty risky as it is common to see a line going out the door. Don&#39;t let that fool you because the register is next to the entrance, so there isn&#39;t any other way to line up but by going outside.

I&#39;ve recently traveled to Ensenada and had the opportunity to eat some really good fish tacos but this place comes exceptionally close in terms of flavor and quality. 

Fish Tacos -- I have never seen Ensenada fish tacos packed so high. I was a little too confident and ordered 2 of them, not knowing how generous of a portion they would each be. The pieces of fried fish were impressive, as were the balance of crunchy outside and tender inside. All of the veggies were incredibly fresh and everything is served on a doubling of warm tortillas. 

Baja&#39;s Tacos -- A motherload of all tacos. I only had 1 and it brought me to the brink of gluttony. As if Ensenada fish wasn&#39;t enough in a taco, the Baja&#39;s Taco includes both fried fish and shrimp. With it&#39;s extreme girth, this can easily be classified as a burrito (alright, maybe a Del Taco kind of burrito). With all its fixings, it can get pretty messy. I had stuff falling out from both ends while trying to conquer this monstrosity. 

But alas, I came out a winner. I was able to eat 2 Fish Tacos and 1 Baja&#39;s Taco without having to unbutton my pants. To boot, I was able to walk back to the car without any assistance. Jenn-1 Tacos Baja Ensenada-0."

As a Yelper/Yelp Elite, this is an amazing achievement since most foodies usually bookmark a place/know of its existence before they go to the restaurant.  I saw the line of people on my way to work one day and was curious to know why/what they were standing in line for.  This has been my fondest discovery as a foodie.

I love the atmosphere (it&#39;s not super touristy YET and really a local favorite/hole in the wall!) here and the Wednesday $1 fish taco deal has me sold.  It can easily be a 40 minute adventure (waiting in line/waiting for food).  

If you order other items like ceviche, they are super generous with the avocado-- you even see them carving out the avocado in their little ceviche bar.

The parking lot is small and the city conveniently has street cleaning on Wednesdays if you&#39;re going for lunch.  You may have better luck parking on Whittier and walking across the street.  Definitely worth the wait and parking hassle!

I don&#39;t usually dine in.  There are plenty of patio seating, but it is rare on a Wednesday.  If you come by during a hot day, don&#39;t expect any air conditioning indoors since the doors are propped open."

Among the best fish tacos I have ever had. This place has a simple menu - fish or shrimp tacos or burritos. You can get sides (rice and beans) as well. They accept credit cards. The decor is dated and the building is dirty - exactly how a taco shop in East LA should be. Plus, it&#39;s busy here, so with so many people coming in and out, it&#39;s nearly impossible to keep this place spotless.

They have a special deal - $0.99 fish tacos on Wednesdays. AVOID! The tacos cost $1.59 anyway. You will be queuing for 1+ hour just to save a few cents. Save the time and come any day but Wednesday.

They play sports games (futbol) on the TV screens. Nice outdoor seating area, if you can get a seat."

Luckily I was working around West Covina so when I saw this was close I did not think twice! 

The inside is a bit small but plenty of seats outside. Parking is street. Menu is simple. They have tacos, burritos, ceviches, and other items as well as beverages. They call out your number and you pick it up.


_Fish Taco ($1.75) Never can go wrong with a classic fish taco. Portion of the fish was huge! It was almost half of the taco which is how it should be. Nicely battered with flakiness inside. Lots of cabbage, a frw tomatoes, good amount of sour cream and a bit of hot sauce. I can&#39;t do spicy but it was just a small amout to add a nice frienly kick. 
_Shrimp Taco ($2.15) This too was great in size. Huge portions of nicely fried shrimps. As you but into it the shrimps taste fresh and real plump. I actually prefered the shrimp a tad, just a tad bit more than the fish. Also same toppings as fish. 

2 was a good portion for me as they are pretty big but that much deliciousness, I would have one more. My only complaint was that the tortilla was too oily. I can feel all the oil on my hand as well as see it. Other than that great price and great tacos!"

The line moves pretty quick for the volume of people that are there, I waited a total of 35 minutes from the time I got in line to the time I received my food. I got the fish taco combo it came with rice and beans, and an extra shrimp taco. Everything was delicious, my daughter devoured the rice and beans and fish taco, with zero complaints. For anyone with a small child getting them to eat can be a struggle in its self I ate the fish taco and the breading and just how it was plated came together so well. the shrimp taco was also very good, it wasn&#39;t overly breaded at all I will definitely be returning.

The fish taco at Tacos Baja Ensenada was good, but I definitely I have had better at Ricky&#39;s Fish Taco and the fish taco stand at my local farmers&#39; market. Their jamaica was a bit over sweetened.

Like other fellow yelpers have mentioned, fish tacos are always $1 every Wednesday which is steal! I came here at 11 am and there was a line out the door, so be prepared to wait! 

Fish Tacos: 
Pros: 
1. The fish pieces were huge! 
2. Crema and red sauce was delicious.
Cons: 
1. Tortilla was hard and dry.
2. Breading of the fish was not crispy. 


Final Verdict: 
Definitely worth fighting through the chaos  once in a while but not on a weekly basis. Food was good but not amazing."

Both the shrimp and fish ceviche has the perfect amout of flavor and you don&#39;t even have to add that much lime! I&#39;m known to put excess amount of lime on basically anything. Oops. On my visit from Denver me and my girlfriend had to stop twice because of the amazing food. 
First visit:
Large shrimp coctel
(2) Shrimp ceviche tostadas
The coctel was a little too sweet for my liking but still very tasty with a good portion of shrimp and cucumber (my two favorites)
Ceviche 10 out of 10.

Day 2: Not as on point as day one. The lady took our order repeated it correctly but when it came time to get it, it wasn&#39;t correct. She somehow got shrimp taco instead of shrimp tostada, and had our food to go instead of dine in. I told the man who serves the food at the counter and after jokingly going in on the lady that got it wrong, he reserved our order. 
I then got one fish ceviche and one shrimp. I asked for 2 shrimp but whatever I didn&#39;t want to bother. The fish ceviche.... PERFECT! 
So they had to lose a star in all fairness with what happened but you can&#39;t go wrong once you get your food!"

I think I personally prefer the baja because the tortilla was so soft and chewy, and the fried fish/shrimp were fried really well.  light and crispy batter and fresh toppings.  

Their shrimp quesadilla had great flavor, and if I had to be super picky, I&#39;d say the shrimp was a tad overdone but still quiet good.  As others have said, this place isn&#39;t brand new or spotless, more hole-in-the-wall, but definately worth a try."

By sheer luck it was Wednesday so we also stumbled upon their super-popular weekly special...$0.99 Fish Tacos on Wednesdays!  So there was a line, a long one at that and the set-up is not ideal for crowds.  The line extends out the door and you have to squeeze pass people to get out front unless you manage to find one of the few seats inside or on the side patio.  You order/pay/pick-up at the counter too so you have to stand around in the limited indoor space.

My friend and I each decided to get our own FISH TACO (normally $1.75) and SHRIMP TACO ($2.15) and we shared a regular-sized CAMPECHANA ($7.99 regular; $10.99 large).  The tacos are pretty sizable and we weren&#39;t quite able to finish the mixed cocktail.  We were both partial to the shrimp taco.  The shrimp was so juicy.  And of the various kinds of seafood in the cocktail, I think we both loved the shrimp most of all.  The other stuff, including octopus, clam, scallops and trophon, plus the huge chunks of avocado, make this a must-try!

One of cool bonuses are the roasted yellow &#34;chiles gueros&#34; lightly sprinkled with red chili powder.  They&#39;re free!  You can snag them at the salsa bar."

Tacos Baja Ensenada is one of those places you&#39;ve got to try, but in a town with fish tacos galore, it still doesn&#39;t take the crown. 
The servings are generous, prices moderate, and the menu options are appreciable. Thing is, when it comes to fish or shrimp tacos, freshness and the batter are most important. It seems they got the freshness down, but the batter is still not quite right. These tacos do not measure up to those I&#39;ve had in Ensenada, Baja California.

Out of the two tacos, the fish was our favorite. It was SO flavorful and the fish was bigger than the tortilla itself! 

If you love lime + fresh seafood, you&#39;ll love the ceviche tostada. For only $6, the portion was huge-- way bigger than any ceviche place in LA. 

The octopus in the mixed cocktail was so effing tender and the scallop pieces were giant! Overall, this place is worth checking out if you&#39;re ever in the area. There&#39;s not much around but at least you&#39;ll get a delicious ass meal. ^______^

There can be a line leading out the door, and the small parking lot behind the building can be tight when it&#39;s full. Just be careful and not back into another car since it&#39;s not well lit.

The food here is just okay. I&#39;ve tried their fish tacos and also their shrimp tacos too. The next time I will give their shrimp cocktails and their ceviches a try too. 

The fish tacos are $1.75 each while the shrimp is $2.15 each. I was a bit bummed that both the fish and shrimp had too much batter. It felt like I was eating a battered taco with all the lettuce, some tomatoes and tartar sauce. The meat was a bit on the tiny side. Yes I was disappointed. 

But at least I enjoyed eating their roastes chili peppers.  It&#39;s delicious!  And they have it outside in their self service condiments table.  Yes,  I had a chili pepper with each taco consumed.  It&#39;s not spicy too spicy, just don&#39;t eat the seeds, or you&#39;ll cry wolf. 

The interesting part is there are so many other taco stands and taco trucks around East LA, that this particular place is one of the busier ones.

The order takers and servers seemed overwhelmed with the influx of customers. But they are very nice taking my order and preparing my food. 

Do I like this place?  Yes, I do think it&#39;s okay. I&#39;m still open to try other things in the menu. But I have definitely tried other places that&#39;s tastier.

While I do remember the food being excellent, what I also remember was an encounter in the parking with someone who said I looked at him in the wrong way and a confrontation ensued. That led me put this establishment out of my mind. 

Fast forward to a few days ago when I happened to be with down the street trying to find some new fanged alternative to bypass rush hour traffic. This place suddenly came into mind and I made a u-turn and headed here. The place looks exactly as it once did. Not particularly glowing but still retaining a lot of its character on the street corner. A smallish parking lot in the back and home directly behind that. There&#39;s a lot street parking but during the day there&#39;s a lot of restrictions so be wary of that. Patio seating available which looks like 10 people. Inside is not that much bigger, perhaps 15 people strong. It&#39;s very limited seating but the food comes very fast and it&#39;s so good that people tend to hoover it down their gullets that seating becomes free quickly. As far as the menu, nothing has really changed that much which is great. I think the newest thing that was added were their food bowls because they are on a separate poster but that&#39;s probably to catch some of the food in bowl crazed people. There&#39;s various seafood dishes from ceviches and cocktails, as well as tacos and burritos. 

You must must must get the fish and or shrimp since I know a few people that are allergic to fish. If possible, please take a few moments to eat it there. Obviously it&#39;s fish so some would say it&#39;s healthy but you should be made aware that the fish is battered than fried, same goes for the shrimp. This is my idea of a fish taco. No offense to the grilled fish tacos which gluten free tortillas which are probably tasty in their own right but that ain&#39;t for me. It&#39;s a very simple thing done right. Lightly battered fish, fried to a crispy golden brown, placed inside 2 warm tortillas, topped with cabbage, a creamy sauce, and pico. This is their top selling item and you can see the evidence right away. They are constantly frying up batches because everyone that goes there order at least 2 or more. I also got the shrimp taco which is made exactly the same way except with......battered shrimp. It&#39;s amazing how quickly it was all ready. My order consisted of 2 fish tacos and 1 shrimp taco which cost me about $7.00 and it was indeed very filling. I waited in line for 8 minutes (Yes Hungry enough to watch the time) and once I finished paying I waited exactly 1 minute for my food. All thrown together on taco delivery plate (Or just plate). To make things even better, theres a condiment bar nearby. There&#39;s limes (Which if you&#39;re not using them than you&#39;re not a friend of mines), chili peppers, and onions that have been doused with chili peppers which add another dimension.

When I was younger, I lived for the Wednesdays when my dad would bring home their $1 fish tacos. I went for the first time in almost 5 years and it was just amazing as I remember. Didn&#39;t go on a Wednesday this time but regardless the tacos are still pretty cheap and totally worth it as the tacos are a pretty generous size and topped with crema and lettuce, tomatoes and onions. I ordered the shrimp and fish taco combo that comes with rice, beans, and a drink. The batter for both the shrimp and fish taco is perfectly crispy and the inside is super moist and get melts in your mouth. My friends ordered the shrimp and mixed tostada (fish+shrimp) and that was also just freekn delicious. It had the perfect acidity to it. Definitely my go to place for fish tacos now if I&#39;m not feeling the drive down to SD. Oh and GET THE CHILES ON THE CONDIMENT CART."

We arrived around 6:30 and there is a line out the door. Took us about 15 minutes to order. Not bad. Took us another 15 minutes to get our food. Overall the wait wasn&#39;t bad considering how many people were there.

They have a condiments bar with radish, lemons, and grilled peppers(must try). They also have complimentary cold water on the counter. 

We ordered a little TOO much for 2 people. We ordered 10 fish tacos and 2 shrimp tacos. I was expecting tiny tacos but these were overflowing. After 4 I was done. You add the lemon, hot sauce, habanero sauce, and enjoy. The fish tacos were such a good deal. Especially for $1.  

The Shrimp tacos were also good but twice the price. I would definitely stick to the fish tacos the next time I come back. I will be back for sure.

The give you a huge fish taco on a corn tortilla covered with the cabbage, tomatoes and that white sauce. They are delish and fried to order! So they come out fresh and piping hot! careful about burning yourself. the shrimp taco is pretty good too but the fish tacos are where its at, 

They also have a ceviche/seafood cocktail bar. This seems pretty popular as well, I&#39;ve tried the shrimp cocktail and their mixed seafood cocktail. This is ok, on par with most other premade mexican ceviche/seafood cocktail orders. Stll tasty but not mind blowing. Please be aware if you order the seafood, they&#39;ll most likely call your number for the seafood firist, you&#39;ll hae to go back a second time to pick up your taco orders as thats done at a separate part of the kitchen.

So the foods good here and the ambiance is unique, quite often there&#39;s some bonuses if you&#39;re dining there, such as live music and fresh fruits. the live music is provided by the random guy sinigng on the patio hoping for tips or maybe a taco. And theres usually a big truck parked outside selling oranges. They often come in with a platter of cut oranges that have been chli powdered that you can sample, if you dig it you can buy a couple of pounds of oranges from the guy outside and theyll deliver it to you.

This place gets packed on a regular basis! I can&#39;t even imagine how the lines are on Wednesday when they have $1 fish tacos all day! (i&#39;m gonna find out for sure though).BUt the turn around is quick, so its not too hard to get a seat.

kept flipping the meat incessantly (a huge no-no for those that know BBQ)

And after every time I leave, I leave telling myself I ate way too much and drank way too much but I probably just had the best meal ever.  This hole in the wall Korean bbq is hands down my favorite place in K-town.  The best things here are the tong galbi (thick cut short rib) and the tong samgyupsal (thick cut pork belly).  My absolute favorite is when they cut the galbi meat from off the bone and serve that.  It&#39;s so chewy and delicious..it&#39;s like fatty beef gum.  

It&#39;s kind of pricey and sometimes they run out of the tong galbi.  However, if you want cheap, you can go to AYCE or something and be served dog quality beef.  Also a tip, if you want to be ensured the tong galbi, call before you go to pre-order the tong galbi.  That way too, the meat will be ready when you get there as it does take a while to cook.  I&#39;ve gone there before without telling them to reserve some galbis and they ran out.  Oh well..at least it means they probably get a fresh batch daily and you&#39;re not getting frozen crap.

I&#39;ve always had great service here.  The workers perfectly time the cooking of the food and is always refilling the banchan, mostly the pico de gallo.  Try offering the owner lady a shot of some soju as she&#39;s down to drink, converse (only in Korean or Konglish), and hook it up with a bottle of soju(if you&#39;ve ordered a bunch already)."

There was a lot of confusion as the workers there did not speak English, and this was our first time ordering KBBQ, so we were very confused as well. However, I guess we managed to communicate that we wanted a combo with an assortment of meats.

1. Generous amount of food. With the combo being around $50, it can probably feed at least 4 people. It came with different cuts of meat, veggies, soups, egg pancakes, side dishes, salads, rice, and etc.

2. The dipping sauces were sooo gooood. I have no idea what they are called.

3. My favorite cut of meat is one that is very similar to bacon. I think we got 4-5 different cuts of meat in total? 

4. Even though the Korean ladies did not understood what we were saying, and we did not understand what she was saying, she was very nice!! She came over, put the meat on the grill, and chopped the meat up when it was done. She also showed us how to wrapped the meat with rice wrappers, salad, a bit of veggies, and dipped it into the sauce!

I have noticed that most of the diners were Korean (which must mean that it&#39;s relatively authentic LOL?). Overall, I am super happy we stumbled into this place for a cheap and fantastic meal!! The other place we were planning to go earlier would have costed us a lot more judging solely from the interior furnishings."

It&#39;s located in a plaza that no one would think of going into to eat one of the better meals I&#39;ve had in ktown lately. 

I came here with my family after my dad swore he&#39;d take us to a new kbbq/Brazilian BBQ fusion restaurant. What? I was wondering how that was possible but i decided to trust him and tagged along. This place is a Brazilian BBQ place where you can grill the meat kbbq-style. They serve salsa and some sauces that they make in house and it is sooo fresh and amazing! The quality of the meat is so tender and just as tasty as the one you&#39;d get at Mgrill (a popular Brazilian BBQ restraurant). The woman who owns the restaurant is so kind and truly understands what customer service is. She goes by all the tables and chats with everyone. She cut up all our meat for us and it was such a pleasure being served by her. It&#39;s sad to see such little reviews :( this place truly is a gem and i&#39;ll definitely be back with more people. Y&#39;all are missing out!"

This place is for the true meat lovers who dont mind that its not an AYCE place or marinated meat.  You just get a chunk of the un-marinated kalbi, bones and all and dip it lightly in salt if u want.  This is how you really get down and appreciate meat! 

I also got the Tong Samgyupsahl (thick cut pork belly).. wow delicious as I am a true pork fanatic!! Wrap it in the romaine lettuce with some kimchi, garlic, pickled jalape√±o. .. or whatever you want and stuff your face! 

Both meats were excellent and of course I had to finish the meal with daenjangchiggae and noorungji~ soup is good and the noorungji is homemade, just the way I like it.

Its a small hole in the wall, owned by a very nice korean lady.  She was so helpful by cooking our meat and bringing extra fresh/specialty side dishes! Love it here and will be back to enjoy the true taste of Tong kalbi &amp; samgyupsahl!"

Both times I only ordered the &#34;tohng galbi&#34; which, I was told, was their specialty. The cut of the galbi is unique and the meat is extremely tender and flavorful. On top of that, they cook and cut the meat for you. It is a bit pricy, but well worth it.

Just thinking about this place makes my mouth water!

Must try at least once!"

We got there and as we were waiting, we noticed the waitress going from one table to another taking shots of soju with the patrons.  

We went there for &#34;whole galbi&#34; so we were willing to overlook the run down restaurant and the waitress ahjooma pounding soju.  Then, we found out that they ran out of the &#34;whole galbi.&#34;  It was only 7:30 on Sunday night. We were disappointed but willing to find some alternatives so we ordered the thick slab of black hog bacon.  

Bacon starts to cook then the waitress brings our side dishes.  She tells us they have run out of some of the side dishes.  &#34;Really? Now, you tell us,&#34; I thought to myself.  Then, when we asked for the steamed egg, they apparently ran out of that as well.  

Thick slab of bacon was good but how can you mess that up?  What they had for side dishes and kimchee were just awful.  Moreover, the waitress became extremely rude when we asked for things.  Not sure if it was the alcohol kicking in this ahjooma&#39;s blood system but we couldn&#39;t stand it anymore and left.  

We drove couple blocks down to Parks for more quality food.  I may never get to experience their &#34;whole galbi&#34; but honestly I would rather pass.  You can get slabs of beef ribs at Bristol farms that are better quality and cook it yourself at home.

This place was by far the worst Korean BBQ joint in Ktown."

This is the ONLY place where I give a 5 star for the services! Most of the KBBQ restaurants are always always crowded, you wait 1 hour at the door to get seated, plus 15 minutes to order your food, then plus 15 minutes to get your food and you can never ever find a waitress to help you in time when you simply just want iced water or napkins. (Tip: For those of us who do not speak Korean, it is always a good plan to bring along a friend who can speak fluent Korean to K-town BBQ, there is a significant difference! Trust me!)

Well, those things will never happen here. The service here is always fast, me and 5 friends came here a while ago on a sunday evening (typical rush hour in K-town bbq restaurants) We got seated very soon, orderer our food quickly, and TWO waitresses came to our table and help us bbq! Yes, thats right, TWO waitresses came to help the same time. Although they dont speak English fluently, but they seems to be very professional and certainly knows how to make everything we ordered extremely tasty!

Last but not least, this restaurant is located in a smaller/quieter plaza on vermont street. It is certainly not as well known as the Kang HoDong or Genwa bbq, but the service is way better &amp; faster and food tastes good. So, if you are looking for a place which is quiet, great service, average food taste with 15$-20$ per person price, this is the place!"

The fiansizzle&#39;s brother and gf have been raving lately about how delicious Korean BBQ is, and we&#39;ve been feeling super unworthy of calling ourselves foodies since we&#39;ve never tried it. Thus, tonight we decided to scratch our KBBQ itch so we can finally feel adept again in our food knowledge!

Anyway, we ventured in and honestly had NO CLUE what we were doing. I immediately informed our server that we needed suggestions, and after a confused expression, she sent over someone who I could explain our scenario to. I told our server we were newbs, and she very kindly pointed out a number of suggestions on the menu. We ended up going with Combo A, which is normally beef brisket and pork loin, but our helpful server let us sub-in marinated beef for the brisket. After getting the main stuff (and some delicious Hite) ordered, I asked the server about kimchi and explained it&#39;s a fav of mine, so she said she&#39;d bring a small order. Within minutes, she brought over 3 KINDS of kimchi for me to try!! She asked which I preferred, and I told her I really liked them all, so she left all 3! Yay for me, kimchi heaven!!! The fianc√© wasn&#39;t quite as excited (as he thinks it smells horrid), but he tried them and actually liked all 3!!

The rest of the food also came quickly, and after the beef cooked, our amazingly sweet server showed us how to go about enjoying the BBQ (what things to add into different bites, different combinations of condiments to try).  Without her guidance, our experience wouldn&#39;t have been the same! 

All in all, great food, great service, and definitely not a one night stand!!! We&#39;ll be entering into at least a dating relationship with this place, but don&#39;t worry, we&#39;re not the jealous type...try it out for yourself, we&#39;re happy to share!"

We were both intrigued and slightly intimidated by the lack of any English on the signs outside, but not to worry: the menu is in fact more or less bilingual, and the staff speak English well enough. Be aware that the name of the restaurant is only in Korean, so you&#39;ll have to look for the address unless you can read hangul. 

Service in fact was both prompt and friendly. The atmosphere is definitely more cosy, family-style, hole-in-the-wall compared to some of the more elaborate BBQ places in Koreatown, but the food was quite good. We had the beef brisket and pork bulgogi, both quite good. Interestingly, the meat here comes with generous helpings of vegetables that get grilled along with the meat. There are multiple side dishes, including the classic seafood-broth infused omelette/custard dish, a vegetable stew, an incredibly good egg and scallion pancake, and lettuce leaves and rice paper for wrapping."

I would have written sooner, but I forgot to take a business card and even though I drove by this place several times, all signs were in Korean.  This time I took note and took a business card.

What makes this place different from other K-BBQ places I have been to has to be the side dishes that come with your meal.  (Check out my pictures)  

The side dishes are really good and you can have as much as you want.  They have really tasty kimchi.  The mushroom caps are sweet.  Make sure you let them sweat a little upside down on the grill to release their juices.

I wish I could remember the name of the other side dishes, in any case, give this place a try.

Yes, it&#39;s in a strip mall. Yes it&#39;s not at all fancy; but the food is really good.  I enjoyed the kalbi and the bogogi.

A meal for two including tip was about 51 dollars, no Soju this time.

If you are in the mood for K-BBQ and don&#39;t like long waits, try Book Sea Tong.  

They also have an really extensive lunch menu.  Lots on it; good prices.

PS, I thought the purple rice was really tasty!"

Our waitress was very nice and patient with us (considering we had no idea how it all worked and that we had our two young children with us). The food was great (beef, pork, and pork ribs with more side dishes than we knew what to do with). I can&#39;t imagine what could have made it better. While there was no wait when we arrived at 7:30 ish, most tables were full by the time we left. Oh, and we were the only non-Koreans in there so I assume (rather ignorantly) that is a good sign.

We ordered the cheesesteak with cheese whiz (of course) and fries. The cheesesteak was amazing! Great bread, great steak and loaded with cheese.

However the parking situation is awful and getting out of your parking spot can be difficult if someone else is parked behind you.

It&#39;s always a challenge to order my oddly customized &#34;Cheese Steak&#34; hold the cheese sandwiches.  Often the cheese is what makes the sandwich tasty and moist in many opinions, and without the cheese it can be less flavorful and dry.

Not the case here at Boos &#39;tho.

The sandwich was moist and tasty.  They cook the meat well, &#39;tho I did inquire about having it done more &#34;medium rare&#34; which they would accommodate, but I opted to get it done their way on my first visit, and it turned out great.

Parking could be tight, but there&#39;s adjacent Silverlake neighborhood residential parking in the adjacent streets, at least there was on a weekend daytime, not sure how it is at night or during peak hours.

I called in for pick up, and the guy who answered the phone was very friendly and helpful. Ordered a cheesesteak with peppers and onions, half wiz, half provolone. 

They did a great job wrapping my sandwich up in insulating materials, and when I arrived home, the sandwich was still steaming hot. Bingo!

Let&#39;s start with the bread- it was hella choice. The grilled onions were killer. The meat was doing it&#39;s thing and getting the job done. I gotta say, I was apprehensive on a fundamental level about the wiz half, BUT DAMN, was it tasty. Much better than the provolone side, in fact. Push your shame deep inside, and order it with cheese wiz, it&#39;s amazing, I promise. 



The one ding however, is that I feel it is a little expensive for an ala carte sandwich (It was like $10.85 with tax) that was not super huge. However, once I added in a bag of chips, I was full. 

Well done, Boo&#39;s. I will be back."

________________________________________________

Reminiscent it&#39;s sister location in K-Town, Boos Philly Cheesesteaks and Hoagies (this particular location, resting on Fountain within East Holly&#39;hood) is a certifiable beacon of perfection, creating objects of beauty.......

.......................ONE BUN AT A TIME.

Having feasted both, within this joint and additionally benefiting from their option of delivery on multiple occasions now........, puh-leeze believe my testament to this place being solid.

SOLID AS A ROCK!!!!!

While menu conveyances are a bit pricier than your average &#34;grub hub&#34; bestowing cuisine of this entity ($9-10.00 would be pretty accurate), the establishment provides a &#34;Rush Hour&#34; reduced price option, Mondays-Friday&#39;s - whereas $7.00 will afford one a cheesesteak and fountain soda. 

* * * THE CATCH to this ^ ^ is that despite this particular location resting on Fountain, said &#34;fountain soda/cheesesteak&#34; concession is SOLELY available by way of their K-Town location.

Boooooooo to that!

Reiterating the aforementioned, having patronized this particular location a number of times, I humbly advocate newcomers reckon on options being presented both FRESH and PLENTIFUL.

We&#39;re talking: 

--- Thinly sliced (lean) steak with optional grilled onions, mushrooms, sweet bell peppers, and your choice of cheese. There&#39;s even an option for a &#34;pizza steak&#34; served somewhere beneath a volcano of marinara and mozzarella.

THE VERDICT: Erupts as a virtual orgasm for your taste buds and mouth palate!!!!!!!

[.....grabs towel and clears throat.....]

Replicating the Carl&#39;s Jr. epigram, &#34;if it doesn&#39;t get all over the place, then it doesn&#39;t belong in your face&#34; --- each order arrives sloppily (that&#39;s a word, right?) and the &#34;Happy Ending&#34; is ejaculated when adding on their option of Cheese Jiz.................I mean, uhm, .......Whiz.

This takes it all up to a whole nubba&#39; lebba&#39; and I&#39;m certain any native of Philadelphia would be quite, quite proud.

In turn and inevitably, I&#39;m driven to implement strategy when ordering from this place.

I don&#39;t eat for days at a time and order 2-3 cheesesteaks and hoagies all at once. Just call me a hoagie hoe.........

While I&#39;ve been the fat azz once and inhaled all 3 within one session, I&#39;ve learned it best simply to refrigerate 2 of the 3 and ration them in accordance throughout the course of a week.

This have proven wise as without doing such, I&#39;m guaranteed to be KNOCKED THE PHUQ OUTTT---------

Just form the delectable aroma percolating from the bag, my wife knew the  sandwich was going to be awesome.   She was so happy I shared it with here.

Personally, I wouldn&#39;t order it again for 2 reasons: one because the cheese was almost non-existent, one slice on the roll, none mixed in (which is what I am use to); second because it was wayyyy too soggy. It was so wet it dripped the entire time I ate it &amp; I felt like I couldn&#39;t set my half back in the basket in the puddle (I ended up putting napkins in the bottom of the basket).

This is a 5-star cheesesteak in any other city, but a 7-star cheesesteak in LA because we don&#39;t have a lot of good ones here, despite (or because of?) the city&#39;s existing roster of culturally-important hot meat sandwiches. 

Not that I have to justify myself to you, but:
1. they use really flavorful lean steak
2. they double-fry the fries -- cuz when is once ever enough???
3. they fly in AMOROSO ROLLS every day
4. they have a cute lil outdoor patio picnic area overlooking a vast auto repair wasteland
5. they put out giant bottles of sriracha, which I recommend using
6. staff is super nice and orders are always right
7. they offer the only correct cheese as a choice, which would be white american

Service is exactly what you should expect: They don&#39;t give many shits, they are there to sling steaks, have an idea of what you want before you come in or get out of the way.

Simple food, well done.  I have been wanting a philly for months... literally months and in LA that is like finding a unicorn.
I ordered the philly, added provolone on half and cheez whiz on the other, order of fries... boom! 
The fries, warm and crispy... crunchy outside and soft center.  Makes you forget about ketchup or ketchup and sriracha ... I immediately piled them into my plate so that the juices from my Philly could mingle with them.
The sandwich...
As my teeth penetrated the various layers of mushrooms, onion, and glorious levels of steak my taste buds watered with anticipation and my eyes grew large ... it is hands down ORGASMIC to bask in such a simple pleasure of deliciousness.

I wasn&#39;t real sure of the meat on the flat top so I just turned away and waited for steak judgment after eating. 

The fries were cooked to perfection, nice deep golden brown, not greasy and all good size not little stubs. The c steak was covered in whiz, enough to dip the fries in. It was smaller than the pictures but not small, medium but heavy. It was piping hot and plenty of meat and cheese. They have good hot Italian peppers, the red and green ones.

My husband and I had just finished a workout and we were famished. I thought the Fountain location was close to Equinox DTLA but it wasn&#39;t. We were headed there until we decided to go to KTOWN. Honestly, I didn&#39;t want to go through the trouble of going to the Boiling Crab Plaza but my husband did make a good point. &#34;No one in KTOWN is up at this hour.&#34; It was 11am. 

We parked on Alexandria and walked up the stairs and where I assumed it would be, wasn&#39;t there. I thought maybe it was an old location not knowing, but it was around the corner, next to the really old bar HMS Bounty. 

We ordered the mushroom with provolone and onions with cheese fries. They even split it for us on two separate trays! (Thank you!) 

The bread was soft and sourdoughy, huge portions of all the fixings (meat, cheese, onions and mushrooms) and the cheese fries was cheesy! I initially asked for it on the side, but they served it on top. Which I didn&#39;t mind, actually, since they poured a lot of it! (I have a control issue, I like to control the amount of cheese I dip into.)

Service was great, food was amazalicious and my belly was happy. My favortie part about Philly Cheesesteaks is the hot peppers. I ate a lot of it. It totally makes the meal. They also had pickled jalapenos as well, but the pickled hot peppers are better.

On the way out the owner said hello and recommended an off menu item. We got on togo and even though we were stuffed, we ate it when we got home. 

THE LOGAN. Oh man, I love spicy food so this was right up my alley. I will never get anything again. Altho, I wonder if I can get it that spicy on the mushroom?

I can&#39;t wait to go back... oh and video coming soon. I need to edit and upload to YT!"

And i don&#39;t think that&#39;s fair, because they charge you enough to not have to do that. If you order 4 cheesesteaks they put three portions of meat on the grill and divide that between the 4 sandwiches. Well they certainly don&#39;t do you that way in Venice, Ca. You get the full portion. Other than that i don&#39;t see anything great about this place for them to charge so much, yet cheat you on the portion. I was so expecting the wow factor.

A philly cheesesteak is my favorite sandwich to eat in the world.  No one can deny the comforting and savory quality that comes with each.  At Boo&#39;s, they make THE best in Socal and most comparable to the one&#39;s I had in Philly.  If wanting to find my favorite in the US though, I&#39;d direct you to Dalessandro&#39;s in Philly, which to me, beats Pat&#39;s, Geno&#39;s, and John&#39;s.

For $8.95, you&#39;ll get a massive hoagie with thinly sliced steak, grilled onions, and your choice of cheese.  This is where I implore you to get cheez wiz. Although provolone is the popular and classic choice, you&#39;re certain to neglect your tastebuds if choosing that route.  GET THE WHIZ instead! It elevates the rich taste and in my opinion, unifies all the complementing flavors of a cheesesteak much better.  The steak is tender, thinly sliced and gloriously excessive at first glance.  I LOVE how they order the Amoroso roll&#39;s straight from philly too, since these soft rolls authentically hold the meat, cheese, and juices better than any other roll. 
 
For only $2.75, you can order a side of LARGE fries that are fresh and comparable to In N Out&#39;s, but slightly thicker.  
----
Conclusion: Located in a questionable area with heavy traffic, Boo&#39;s serves some fantastic and affordable cheesesteaks that could compete with many spots in Philly.  One can be shared among two people, but with how good they are, you may want to be selfish. Don&#39;t miss out on this soon to be iconic cheesesteak joint in silverlake/K-Town.  Ill be sure to come back to try their Pizza Cheese Steak and pizza fries! 

Extra Notes:
-Accepts credit card
-Sandwich does get soggy after a while, but with the juices within, that can&#39;t be avoided. Eat with haste.
-Friendly, fantastic service
-Decor could use some work as furnishings look run down and old.  Outside of building looks sketchy too
-Parking lot is tiny--street parking is available though
-Restrooms could be cleaner"

Weird thing is the chicken cheesesteak is almost as good or better than the beef. Cheese choices are tough as well because they have a nice, creamy white american that works real well, but I love the Cheese Whiz as well.

+++STEAK, MUSHROOM, PROVOLONE WITH EXTRA MEAT+++

The sandwich was served really sizzling hot. Lots of meat, enough mushroom and cheese was in the bottom. The bread tasted much better this time than my previous visit . Not as soggy. But my problem still with the meat. Until now I don&#39;t really know if the meat they are serving is RIB EYE STEAK, I doubt it. The taste just does not do it for me and still like first time, chewy unseasoned as well, had to add salt to it. 

Well, with all the good reviews maybe its time to go have my taste bud checked with my Doctor...On second hand, hell no, I know what I was eating.

The cheese whiz saturates the tender cuts of meat and it just becomes an amazing sandwich. The bread they use also goes very well with the meat and cheese.

You think this place knows its origins. The small shack has touches of cool graffiti that draw you in rather than encourage you to look elsewhere. Once inside, hungry patrons munch away at their hogie&#39;s. A colorful assortment of Wise potato chips greets you at the counter instead of the cashier. How the hell did they get those here? Are they personally carrying those across the country? I&#39;ve never seen them outside of Jersey. I&#39;m excited. This place is out &#39;Jersey-ing Mike.

I order the traditional, with provolone (the original Italian sandwich predates the Wiz by 20 some-odd years). I ask for fries. And a root beer. This is great. It&#39;s like I&#39;ve come home. Even the cashier hardly cares about my emotional excitement for what they are serving up. And that is just fine. 

My order is up fast. And they are busy. This is a well oiled machine, through and through. The hoagie is hotter than hell. I can&#39;t take a star off for having to wait for a hot ass sandwich. But the anticipation is killing me. Of course I don&#39;t wait long enough, but the soda takes temps down a notch and bam...just like I was hoping. It&#39;s perfect. Just like home. I&#39;d need it side by side with Chicks to see the difference, but I swear it&#39;s the same.

I look in the bag for fries. No fries. I ask the cashier. She tells me I need to order them. Back home I would tell her you &#34;shoulda opened ya ears, wats the madda wit you?&#34; and not risk her pulling a gun.  

So the origin is a bit lost but the taste is there...like, to a T."

I decided to get a Cheesesteak Hoagie, which contains grilled onions, lettuce tomatoes, mayo and your choice of cheese. I decided to go with provolone, but you can also get cheese whiz and American. I also ordered a side of fries. The portion sizes were pretty large. The size of the cheesesteak and the amount of fries can easily feed two people. The cheesesteak tasted fantastic! The meat was juicy. The bread did a good job soaking up the juices from the meat while not falling apart, and the other toppings complimented the meat well. The fries tasted like they were recently cut and peeled. 

The service here is pretty good. The cashier and the other workers were kind and respectful and completed my order in a timely fashion.

It&#39;s for those days when Thirsty Thursday the night before escalated too quickly and after it was too late, you remembered you work on Fridays and nothing but a greasy, enormous, oozy philly cheesesteak could quell the physical pain of working with a hangover.

Warning: the Philly cheesesteaks are highly addictive and messy, as they should be. They have chicken and steak, with different cheese options including whiz, provolone and American. The meat is flavorful, seared nice and hot on the grill, and I love the selection of toppings available...I usually go with the sweet peppers, onions and mushrooms. I love that they have pepperoncino peppers, jalapenos and other condiments like sriracha and hot sauce for the taking next to the register. This is sloppy, greasy, sinful food at it&#39;s best. It&#39;s not my absolute favorite cheesesteak of all time, but it certainly makes top three in LA.  Their hoagies are also huge and delicious.

Boo&#39;s is located on the corner of a busy street, and they have a small private lot, if you are so lucky to chance upon a free space. Otherwise, there is some street parking. They have a small dining area and a few tables outside. Or, call your order in for quick and easy pick up."

Came here for lunch around 1pm on a Wednesday with a friend; surprisingly not that crowded for lunch time. Ordered up two Boo&#39;s Cheesesteaks with onions and provolone, large fries, and drinks.  There are three different cheeses to put on (American, Provolone, and Cheez Wiz) but if you are indecisive you can ask them to put a different type on each half.

They were greasy and good, but definitely not something I can eat often. Now I&#39;ve never been to Philadelphia so I don&#39;t know how genuine these cheesesteaks are but everyone here on Yelp has been raving about Boo&#39;s authenticity, and the cheesesteaks definitely deliver in terms of taste. The fries were OK, I prefer the thicker cut fries when eating cheesesteaks or hoagies.

I&#39;ll jump on the cheese steak band wagon it is the best I&#39;ve had... I&#39;m not from Philly so this has got to be my closest to the real deal. 
The meat is seasoned well, the optional onions &amp; cheese of choice is offered but I go with the cheese whiz people cause it&#39;s how to have one in my opinion. The roll is fresh &amp; slightly crusty. The portion is well served on both the sandwich &amp; sides.. I like the fries here a lot! I think they double fry &amp; season the fries because they&#39;re crunchy &amp; very tasty without any condiment. 
They also offer hot peppers &amp; pickled peppers that are complimentary self serve 
The drinks are self serve so you can load up on your choice of soda or iced tea. 
Seating is good inside or on the little patio. Parking can be tough I usually walk here from work but when I&#39;ve had to drive here it can be tight... 

Pros: the sandwiches are super tasty &amp; well made with great portions staff is super chill

Cons: parking"

We came here for lunch and it smelled amazing! The guy at the counter was really friendly. They had several tables inside and a little patio outside.

I ordered a philly cheesteak with mushrooms on provolone cheese. And if you&#39;re a fan of cheese whiz, they have it here and you can order your sandwich half cheese whiz and half provolone (that&#39;s how my boyfriend likes it)!

Be careful, the sandwiches were really hot and fresh! AND, be careful of the dripping oils that leak off the sides of the sandwich. Try not to burn yourself if you&#39;re eager to take a big first bite.

It was very flavorful! Very meaty and cheesy. Yum!

Parking can be a bit challenging in this area. But it&#39;s worth the drive if you want a good philly cheesesteak!"

the sandwich was ginormous.  how else do you describe this beast?  the general consensus was that it was pretty darn good.  came out hot (actually, super hot) and cheesy. lots of flavor .  as you can imagine, the sandwich gets a little soggy due to the intense amount of cheese melted on this baby.  so try to eat it fast.

obviously this sandwich is on the heavier side so you really have to be in the mood to eat this.  you probably will want to food coma on a couch afterwards and binge watch episodes of k-town (we aren&#39;t ashamed. that is what we did).

i have to point out that i found this sandwich so much better than the philly cheesesteak i tried in philly (i was not a fan of genos... at all).

AMBIENCE:  casual. no frills just hefty sandwiches. outdoor seating is also available in case it is a beautiful day.

SERVICE:  amazing/friendly.  not sure if we were talking to the owner but he was super excited that we were first timers.  he explained the menu and gave a solid recommendation.

PARKING: we parked at a meter.

OVERALL:  good sandwich place.  if you are looking for a cheesesteak sandwich, i would recommend trying boo&#39;s."

The meat is so tender and flavorful. And you get to choose different types of cheese and toppings. You can even do half and half of the different cheeses! The fries were good too with steak and Cheez Wiz. 

I got the Boo&#39;s Butterscotch Cupcakes, made and delivered by Creme Caramel, one of my favorite dessert places. The cake was nice and moist and there were little nuggets of butterscotch in the cake. The frosting was a little too sweet for my taste, but nonetheless DELICIOUS!

If you are glancing over the pictures yelpers have posted and wondering why there is a fork in most pictures with the sandwiches, that&#39;s because when you lift up your sandwich to eat all the goodies (tomatoes, pickles, and onions) come spewing out. That&#39;s how filled each one are. Meat and condiments are packed in every inch of the sammy. And you&#39;ll need a fork to scoop the rest of the goodies into your mouth.

Cold sandwiches are topped with Cheese, Lettuce, Tomatoes, Pickles, Onions, Dressing, Mustard &amp; Mayonnaise. Their pickle/giardiniere-esque blend is unparalleled - love it. 
I also love that Giamela&#39;s subs comes with 2 carrot sticks &amp; 3 jalape√±os - carrot sticks for the illusion of being healthy &amp; jalape√±os for heat! 

The weakest part of their sub is the bread though - it always gets soggy because of how much filling there is.

We came in in a hot day, and eating there was quite unpleasant. There&#39;s no windows or air conditioning in the place. The only source of air to flow is through the gated door. As a customer I don&#39;t enjoy that experience especially in 100+ degree weather. It&#39;s stuffy inside.

Mmm...spaghetti and meatballs. Sounds better than what it actually was -- Two large meatballs in meat sauce over a generous plate of perfectly cooked pasta. Yep, the pasta was the best part. The sauce could&#39;ve used some flavor.

Everyone swears by their subs though. The large turkey and roast beef looked great and actually deserves to be called a sandwich. It was a considerable size and was packed with fresh meat and vegetables (cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, and onions) along with mustard and mayonnaise. Very tasty.

Plenty of Italian options. Along with pasta and subs, there&#39;s also pizza. The place is on the smaller side and was crowded during lunch so come just before or after the mealtime crowd to find decent seating."

I had the meatball sandwich sans the onions and tomatoes. The pickles they put on are chopped up into cubes. They are mild but do tend to fall off when you&#39;re trying to fit the sandwich into your mouth. Probably why they give you a fork. Comes with a few carrots as well. 
I got the large as it was only 50 cents more. I ate half and saved the other for later. Very good flavor, good firm meatballs, easy on the sauce. Nice sandwich.

I was also looked at like I had two heads when I asked if they make chicken parm subs, which was my mistake as I thought I was at an Italian sub shop on planet earth. All jokes aside, I&#39;d probably opt for a cold sandwich if I came back. Everything is fresh and decent but it just doesn&#39;t deliver as an old school Italian deli/sub shop."

Service, I would give 1 star because the casher took my order wrong and was too rushed so that she didn&#39;t want to list all toppings for my sub.

The sub was too soggy and was not toasted. I was not told for an option to toast my bread or not if there&#39;s any options for that. I really hate soggy bread for my sandwiches, it is the worst. Pastrami quality wasnt too horrible but not good either. It was more of store bought thin ham texture with sodium. Pickles and tomatoes were chopped as toppings on the sub with a few pieces of over cooked peppers and dried raw carrot sticks with a few pickled peppers from a jar.

Pepper steak meat quality was terrible. The meat was crumbled rather than in chunky steak looking pieces. It did not have much flavor, but the toppings were just the same as all other subs. Cheese was not melty enough. 

If you are taking the subs to go, ask for a plastic bag, other wise all the water from(I dont know what caused the juice) from the sub will wet the paper bag and most likely you will find the subs on the ground...

Service is whatever, I had a checkin offer for a free slice of pizza( on yelp, it does not mention!) but it was only with purchasing the beverage. So basically I am buying the slice of pizza by ordering a drink that I dont want. They do not have unsweetened drinks at all or bottled water. 

I think locals would love this place for a quick bite with a big portion to fill yourself at a subway price."

I had driven by this place multiple times on my way to the crack factory (AKA Costco), but had never stopped in.

Fortunately, the outside had a rather fresh coat of stucco, because the interior was somewhat dank.  There was enough seating for the lunchtime crowd (approximately 8-10 tables).  The wall was festooned with photos from its glory days, as well as a comically out of place Spanish sign: &#34;Disfrutas Coca Cola... Mr Coke.&#34;  For some crazy reason, it was stapled onto a rotting piece of wood... and it had a bullet hole.  My coworker and I were dying with laughter when I said in cleaning lady voice (from Family Guy), &#34;No.... Meester Coke is no here.  No, you cannot leave message.... Nooo&#34;

Anyway, onto the food.  We both got the pepper steak with roasted pepper mayo.  The sandwich (even the regular) is pretty monstrous.  It was loaded with chopped pickles, tomatoes, raw onions, two carrot sticks, and pepperoncini peppers.  It almost reminds me of giardiniera from Chicago-style Italian beef sandwiches.  Bonus points for the raw onions for not being too spicy / tear inducing.

The sandwich itself was loaded with beef, which seemed steamed / boiled.  The beef was ok, but nothing to write home about.  I did taste the black pepper, but hardly appreciated the roasted pepper mayo.  I did enjoy the provolone cheese.  

Parking is pretty tight, but I suppose you could try to park on the side street if needed.

If nothing else, this place is worth coming back for the &#34;road trip&#34; experience.  And as Katie B reminds me (after the fact) - check in on Yelp, get a free slice of pizza! (with purchase of a large sandwich and a drink). 
Yet another reason to go back a second day for lunch!"

With the reviews saying size doesn&#39;t always mean better and other reviews saying it&#39;s dry......I just set the bar pretty low. 

i like.

I shared a large pepper steak and it was ginormous. Usually when sandwiches are that big, I highly doubt they taste good, but lo and behold it was delicious. Topped with lots of veggies, and the meat was packed in and it was not at all dry or bland. The bread! It complimented the sandwich very well and it wasn&#39;t dry and overbearing in the least bit --- which is probably what I was afraid of the most. Great bang for your buck. For two people, a large sub with drink and FREE slices of pizza (w/check in) came out to ~$10.

First time around I tried the pepper steak that everyone raves about. Having just moved from Philly, I was not a fan. Just ok at best. 

This time I tried the Italian sub. I opted not to get the mustard and mayo on it. The meat was on point, but that pepper/onion/pickle mix they put on top is just too difficult/messy to eat. The rolls are good but they get soggy quick.

The meals here are a tremendous value. My wife and I will typically split a spaghetti and meatballs dish (along with the accompanying salad...which is also awesome).  Sandwiches and pepper steaks (large ones) can also be split between two reasonably hungry adults.

Only drawback would be its small parking lot and difficult parking and very limited seating. Otherwise, this is a wonderful pasta and sandwich (maybe pizza) place."

Giamela&#39;s seems like a pretty good place to go if you&#39;re hungry and on a budget. The food is satisfying and you&#39;ll get your money&#39;s worth. My mom was craving Italian on a Sunday afternoon and I always pass this place by on my commute so I thought to try it out. It has its own parking lot which is wonderful since so many Los Angeles eats either make you park on the street or overcharge you to park in a shared lot. There are only a handful of spaces though so you may have to resort to street parking on a busy day. The inside has a couple of tables and is pretty clean. If you&#39;re looking for a hip eatery this isn&#39;t for you. It&#39;s more like a mom and pop neighborhood type place. You order from the menu posted next to the register and if you&#39;re dining in they bring your food to you. The staff were very nice. My brother and I ordered slices of pizza and my mom got the lasagna. The pizza wasn&#39;t anything spectacular, but it hit the spot and for $3.50 for 2 slices, it was a good deal, but you&#39;re better off buying an entire medium or large pizza for a couple bucks extra. The lasagna wasn&#39;t very flavorful and drowned in sauce. The garlic bread didn&#39;t taste particularly of garlic, more like the wisp of a thought of garlic really. Maybe we should&#39;ve ordered from their sandwich menu since it is a sandwich place after all, but I assumed since Italian is also on their sign they would also make decent Italian dishes. Would I be coming back to Giamela&#39;s anytime soon? Maybe not, but if I&#39;m ever craving some pizza and I&#39;m in the area I might."

I ordered a pastrami and my own steak sandwich just  steak, egg, cheese, grilled onions &amp; mushroom. Not really into having pepper in my sammie at this time. All were great. I could have just ordered one and shared with my mom and niece. So the rest went straight to lunch tomorrow. lol

-they&#39;ve got Orange Bang.

-it was a hot day and there was no AC so it was pretty hot inside as well. A ceiling was trying its darndest but alas the air was not moving nearly enough to keep things comfortable.

I ordered a medium pizza (as I always do from here) for pick up. When I showed up they brought out a large pizza. I told her I ordered a medium and she said she thought I said it was a large. Then she said it was just a little more than a dollar more. So...I didn&#39;t want to waste the pizza and get nit picky over a dollar so I paid for it and left. 

It is ok that they got my order wrong. But they prob should have just charged me for the medium pizza price and not large. Somewhat disappointed by this experience especially since I&#39;m such a regular there. 


========Original Review below==========
Pretty good pizza. Very reasonably priced. Meatball sandwich is pretty good. This place is in a great location, just off the freeway and has plenty of parking. Overall they do many things good. Not great. But good. And for the price that is more then anyone can ask for."

I never appreciated a good sub as a kid and I never knew the name of this place until about a year ago.

Stepping in this place brought back memories from over 15 years ago of when I would come in here with my dad. The place looked and felt the same. The subs were still humongous, messy, and tasty. It was a great reminder of when times were carefree and I&#39;m so glad this place is still around.

For the price, you get a very generous portion. I usually ordered roast beef, meatballs, or pepper steak. I must go back to try the pastrami. Just be sure not to wait too long to eat it because it&#39;ll get soggy and that&#39;s when it gets really messy."

The meatball is very good. I got the large size and had half of it for lunch the next day. They use traditional rolls so don&#39;t expect the bread  to last long without being soggy. Its covered in all kinds of accoutrement that actually work pretty well. 
The hot pastrami was OK. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll have it again but the meat itself was good. like the meatball the roll was soggy really quick and didn&#39;t hold together the sandwich well enough for me to eat all of it in one sitting.

Having seen all the great reviews I figured I&#39;d take this chance to swoop in and give it a try. I just wasn&#39;t blown away with Giamela and her sandwiches. 
You do get your money&#39;s worth here - sandwiches are stacked heavily with veggies and weighed a good 2-3 pounds just for the regular. I can only imagine you&#39;d need a wheelbarrel to wheel yourself out after eating a large. But for me - bigger isn&#39;t always better.
If you can&#39;t hold the sandwich and take a bite without all the innards going every which way...your sammie&#39;s overloaded! The quality of the actual ingredients was high and I could tell things were very fresh. I like my sandwiches a little more simple so for those who like a sandwich with everything, this may suit you better. 
I also just felt a little bit of a weird vibe inside the small place (more of a takeout place) and wasn&#39;t feeling the love in the service or the sandwich. Maybe those are the two missing ingredients that could make this place a real hit for me."

The first thing I tried here was the Pepper Steak sandwich and I was hooked after that. The Pepper Steak isn&#39;t like a Philly Cheese Steak, as I have had plenty of those and I am not impressed by most cheese steaks from Philly. Their cheese steaks are more like Italian beef sandwiches than cheese steaks so that&#39;s why Philly natives get their panties in a bunch. If you are a mans, man then you will appreciate the large quantities of meat that they put on their sandwiches. The Everything Pizza is ridiculously good and is my favorite pizza in a LA.

I&#39;ve had the steak and pastrami... and they&#39;re pretty good... but just so messy and the ingredients are not evenly distributed, some bites you only get meat, other bites you only get tomato onion and pickle.

What stole my heart was a special they had on the whiteboard for a turkey avocado sandwich with pesto mayo.  omg... probably the best turkey sandwich I&#39;ve ever had.  The turkey was perfect, the avocados were fresh, the bread was nice and soft but crispy to the bite, the cheese was melted but not gone, the pesto mayo just added such excellent flavor!  And the combo&#39;s great because it comes with chips and a soda too.

The girls are super friendly, and the service is pretty fast.  It&#39;s full of regulars, so you know it&#39;s good enough to keep going back.  I am yet to try their pizza, but after this turkey sandwich, I don&#39;t wanna try anything else!! So good!"

(a) millennials
(b) with juvenile taste 
(c) all of the above
 
walked in a little past noon for lunch and they were playing k-pop rap song. the decor is dark with red, blue &amp; green light fixtures on the ceilings; clearly, a perfect spot for eating and drinking with 15 or more peeps to celebrate one&#39;s birthday. afterwards, the group heads out to a karaoke and rents a huge room and continue to drink, sing &amp; merry. 

i tried their lunch specials $14.99 (buckwheat &amp; galbi- marinated short ribs - combo and galbi jjim - braised short ribs - yes, both. hush, don&#39;t judge) and all the flavors were heavily seasoned and too sweet. also, the description of galbi jjim is misleading as it didn&#39;t say it&#39;s with chili paste - i was expecting the soy sauce marinade. 

the food here is more of a &#39;contemporary&#39; approach than the traditional version. unfortunately, didn&#39;t taste the depth of fermentation or natural ingredients. at the end of the meal, they serve super bright orange &#39;drank&#39; that tasted like a mixture of sugary orange juice plus tang powder - another way too sweet flavor! honestly, everything tasted sweet &amp; spicy. in my humble opinion, if you&#39;re looking for refined, more traditional korean flavors, chosun galbi is still my top pick. btw, they serve dessert rice drink at the end of the meal. 

p.s. although they accidentally charged me more, which they quickly fixed and apologized for their mistakes, the service was good and cannot complain!"

Despite waiting 45mins for my cold buckwheat noodles, I will give them the two extra stars for refilling our banchan and the really yummy and tender Korean BBQ ribs that we got along with our meal. Mom was able to eat the Korean BBQ ribs, and so that&#39;s what prompted the extra stars. Also, I got my free Coke soda for Yelp Check in too :)

For $14.99, we each got the Korean BBQ ribs (6 pieces each), and Mom got the Seafood Tofu, and I went with the cold buckwheat noodles. 

Mom&#39;s Seafood Tofu was alright - small shrimps and octopus pieces, no clams or big shrimps in there. Served with a small bowl of purple rice - the tofu soup doesn&#39;t compare to Young Dong Tofu in San Gabriel, especially the rice - served in its stone pot that contains the crispy ice on the bottom, yum! As for my cold buckwheat noodles - a lil al dente, and chewy, but the cold and refreshing taste and its tangy broth made up for it, despite 45mins wait. 

To makeup for the buckwheat noodles, we were given each a cup of orange juice for dessert. It was too sweet for my Mom, but I Iiked it, and that was decent of them since we didn&#39;t get any orange juice dessert the first time we were here.

Service: Still hit and miss, but still friendly, and so I won&#39;t deny that.

OMG they sell liquor! I am not an alcoholic (blush) but I do like a soju with my gogi (I am Korean).

Plus this time around our server was SUPERB!!!!! He cooked our meat to the rareness we asked for and constantly came around to ask us if we needed anything else... and we were seated in the far back corner!

With this type of service and this quality meat we will definitely be back!! We ordered 3 servings of only the premium beef #1 and the marbling was simply beautiful!!! ....and yes we all teared after the first bite. We also ordered the taste-sized buck wheat noodles and the portions were that of a full sized dish at other restaurants. When asked if this was normal, they informed us, &#34;if you order meat we give you big portion&#34;. Awesome blossom."

You are a magician on the grill. Thank you for the BEST service I have received in a LONG time. You knew the perfect moments for the meats, made great conversation AND you were a professional the whole way. 

The food:
We got the XL Combo plate ($149.99 as of 03/04/2016). When I tell you I was shocked by how universe-bendingly delicious was.... How tender the beef cuts were. How moist the pork was.. And he chicken. THE CHIIICKEN!!!!! 

This meat was SO fresh and delicious, it was almost a shame to see they were not filled to capacity with hungry people!! It was around 10:00pm on a Friday and we were the ONLY people in the restaurant!

Bottom Line:
Come here. Ask for Joon."

I&#39;ve been here a multiple times every time I visit from SF, and I have never been disappointed any time. They offer so much varieties of side dishes compared to other restaurants, inside is huge, workers are very attentive, and meat is sooOoOo good.

Bibimnaenymyun- good
Moolnaengmyun- great
Galbitang- salty and meat was dry
Spicy galbitang- salty and meat was dry

We came during the Father&#39;s Day rush, so the place had a lot of people but wasn&#39;t completely full. Maybe they were short staffed, but it took a while to get seated even though there were enough empty tables for all of us to be seated right away. 

I really hate writing negative reviews, but when I (nicely) made a complaint about the food, the manager was short with me and brushed it off - I don&#39;t tolerate rudeness, especially because Korean ahjuhshis tend to not take girls/young women seriously. Not okay, so here I go.

The noodles came all clumped up and our galbi was burned. We went ahead and ate the burned meat because it didn&#39;t bother me so much... But so many of the noodles came clumped up and just wouldn&#39;t separate no matter how much I shook and stabbed at them w my chopsticks. They definitely cooked the noodles all wrong. I tried eating a clump but had to spit it out because it was soggy on the outside and undercooked on the inside. Nasty. We ordered another noodle order (fully intending to pay for all orders) but it didn&#39;t come for 30+ minutes because the kitchen was backed up, so we cancelled it. 

All that said, I&#39;m sure the food will improve when they&#39;re not as busy (which is basically always). But I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll ever come back since bad service and rude ahjuhshis can&#39;t be fixed."

I wanted to take her somewhere new. I&#39;ve taken her to all of my favorite places so far so I decided.... to take the risk and try this place.

Our server Joon was extremely friendly and helpful. He actually helped us with the menu and probably saved us a couple of dollars too!

We went for the AYCE Gold $29.99 but before 4pm you get $5 off so it becomes 25.99!! WOOHOO! We wouldn&#39;t have known tried to go for the combo or something because we thought the all you can eat option wouldn&#39;t be worth it.

The banchan they give you are amazing. Even their dishes were very neat. What sets this place aside from other all you can eat bbq joints are the presentation. Despite being an all you can eat bbq place they still give you impeccable service and their side dishes and dishes all come out very elegantly. 

I absolutely fell in love with their dishes.... the gold little dishes reminded me of when I visited korea when I was very young.

ANY WAY

The meat.
 
The server emphasized that the quality of their AYCE option and their entree option (which is pricier) were the same and reminded us not to worry if we think it&#39;ll taste bad. 
We decided to trust him haha
First we ordered their brisket and their knuckle meat (This would be the meat and fat part right next to the bones) and it was great! The quality of the meat was very nice. 

I ordered the 9.99 cold noodle with my meal so I got full a little faster. But this place used to be known for their cold noodles when it was Chil Bo and of course it doesn&#39;t live up to that but it was still good, or it was better than what I expected. 
We decided to get the marinated steak which was not heavy on the marinade thank goodness. It was more like &#34;seasoned&#34; which I very much enjoyed. 

I also got an order of their steak tartare. Yes, I was very skeptical but after tasting their meat I was a little more reliant with their choices in meat so I went for it and It was so savory! I did think it could&#39;ve used a little more sesame oil to get rid of the excess meat smell but it was still delicious!

Both my friend and I kept saying, &#34;I really like this place&#34; and wanted to thank our server but... mid meal our server changed and we didn&#39;t get a chance to get to know our new server but Joon, he was hilarious and very helpful!

However, the mul nangmyun was decent but let me say, the galbi was good. 

I&#39;d recommend coming here to just eat the meat. I didn&#39;t have time to sit down and cook the meat but next time, Im going to just have meat haha

I came for lunch and they have lunch for 9.99 and 14.99. The 9.99 are your go-to Korean dishes like sullungtang, naengmyun, doenjang jiggae. They are good and worth the lunch price. 

The best part is the number of side-dishes that come out. You feel like you are getting your money&#39;s worth since the side dishes are a lot. They have at least 7 side dishes, my favorite one is the Korean pancake - pajun. This review is for lunch since I did not eat the KBBQ here yet."

Chilbo had the best kalbi jjim, in my opinion so I was hoping for a dining experience just as delicious. But Brothers was average for kbbq. We were hesitant to initially dine here because valet informed us that there is no alcohol license yet, but the 4-star Yelp status had us staying.

There is a special on a la carte BBQ meats: non-marinated short rib, marinated short rib, and pork neck are buy 2, get one free. We got the short ribs and the meat was tender and fatty! There was also a special on stews, which was $7.99 for soybean stew and kimchi chiggae. 

We also got both cold noodles, water and spicy, but those were nothing special. The water cold noodles (mul naengmyun) broth wasn&#39;t very flavorful, and the spicy was too sweet. 

The banchan wasn&#39;t bad, my favorite was the kimchi. We also had a dried squid, raw onions, salad, potato salad, and dongchimi. I also liked the dipping sauce for the kalbi, which was a pickled jalape√±o soy sauce with wasabi. 

Service was a little sloppy. We had to ask different people to refill banchan and would eventually get two of everything because it took so long. We also had to ask for steamed egg. The servers were so quick in cooking the meats that they dropped onions and meat under the grill, wasting some of our food. I&#39;m glad I tried Brothers, but I probably won&#39;t return."

Their food was just unacceptable. Galbi was very thin and mediocre in quality. I would have pulmoowon instant mool neng myeon over their boring mool neng myeon.

We then returned with a larger group of people-the service drastically decreased.  We had a table of 5 adults, yet they limited each order to 2 meats at the time.  By the time the two tiny meats cooked, it took 1 minute for the 5 of us to eat it, and then another 20 minutes for them to bring another tray of 2 meats, which cooked for another 10 minutes, which was again gone in 1 minute.  Mind you, we were there for 3.5 hours until we actually got tired (not full, but tired).

Meat- meat quality is good, dont get me wrong. Portions were small but, good quality. $$$ More on the pricier side. 
As for the combo options, neither the waiter or I, would recommend the combo. The waiter said combo platters are just OK. His hesitation meant dont get it. They give you pineapple to grill. That was great!

If you order few orders of the meat, they give you a small side of Miso Stew (DwengJang cchigae)

We were told to wait while they setup our table. Brass silverwares and bowls and the marble tabletop made the interior look soothing  and it had ample spacing. Indeed they had to carefully set up the table with 10 different kinds of side dishes (banchan) and they replaced empty dishes with full side dishes as soon as we emptied into our stomachs. Our main server CL was pretty and was exceptionally helpful she prepared all the cooking for us.

Third wave of disappointment when we asked for more food and they gave us very small portions that could only feed 3/4 of the people around the grill.  Fourth wave of disappointment when they gave us the wrong type of grill and it took us 30 minutes to cook one side of the beef we had - were they trying to deter us from eating too much??  I&#39;ll never know.  One thing I do know is that I won&#39;t be wasting my limited meals when I visit LA on this place.

Came here for dinner on a Saturday. 
Ordered beef brisket, marinated galbi and some naengmyun. Their price is about the same as Genwa. $$$ 
They didn&#39;t have any cabbage or sesame leaves. Didn&#39;t have rice paper or the radish. The meat was good quality however the naengmyun was pretty bland.

I could hear everything coming from the kitchen area. The servers were hanging out there because it was pretty empty on a Saturday night. I thought they could use some more training because our server kept forgetting things we asked for because he was just chitchatting/chilling with other servers where I could see them. I wasn&#39;t too happy about that as a customer. 

They do not have alcohol license so they do not carry alcohol.

Even the salad was fresh and crunchy! Also, they give you PURPLE RICE. I love japgokbap and was pleasantly surprised when they brought out the rice.

Expansive spread of banchan.  Service was really lovely - they come by and cook it for you, and our waitress was really on point with her recommendations about the progression/order of the proteins.  Grills were changed out regularly. Meat quality was overall excellent - all the premium beef cuts were so delicious!  The only disappointing one, oddly, was the brisket - not fatty at all, but so chewy! But with so many premium meat choices, why bother? I also love the traditional tableware they use.  The super concentrated fresh orange juice they offer as &#34;service,&#34; was delicious.  

My new favorite!  For $40, I felt like I got Kang Ho Dong quality at AYCE prices.  Win win!"

He interacted really well with our table and we all had a great time. They also gave us complimentary sodas and yukhoe/yukhwae (similar to beef tartare, but marinated in Korean sauces and spices). 

The kalbi and samgyeopsal were yummy, but the chadol was the best I&#39;ve ever had! Usually the chadol is good to very good at the other restaurants around here (Kang Hodong, Hae Jang Chon, etc.), but not as amazing and flavorful like the chadol here! I would come back for the chadol alone."

I tried the bibim cold noodles combo with la galbi. I can say it was just alright. Not bad...not too sweet and had decent flavor. Pretty typical. My mom thought a lot of their dishes were too sweet (like her yookgae jang). Branchan was just okay too. My family wasn&#39;t too impressed (and were Korean). I think Brothers BBQ needs to step it up since they&#39;re a new business. Overall, nothing was a wow factor."

A huge plus- their own private lot for parking. 

People seem to miss this one on the busy Weekend nights bc it&#39;s not as hip as something like Quarters. But you don&#39;t have to wait hours to eat, and it&#39;s good bbq in a comfortable nice setting."

I was really impressed with all the blending of different flavors from sweet to salty to tangy... It was so good I didn&#39;t want it to end. The meat is cooked in stages starting with the thinnest of meats that cooked up quickly to the slow cooking of the pork belly and finishing with the chicken.

Everyone said it was so good and it is sad they closed down.

Few weeks later, they started to do some fixing inside, then the sign came down
and changed to Brother BBQ (Hyung Jae Gal Bi).

The BBQ grill is mixed with Gas &amp; charcoal and meat is fresh!
Bit on the pricier side, but quality meets the standard.

Side dishes are clean and tastes just right. 

Naeng Meun regular size is huge, so for people like me who can eat so much, order mat-bo-gi size, which is the smaller version.

Apparently in the last few months there have been some major changes. They now have an AYCE option and have finally gotten their liquor license. When I arrived on a Sunday with my family at 5:45pm, it was pretty empty. I&#39;d say the restaurant was only about a quarter occupied. Our waiter told us it would be more cost effective to go with the AYCE option. So we ordered then waited and waited and waited. Our meat finally came, a measly two strips of galbi. Our banchan selection was also subpar. We noticed other tables had stuff we hadn&#39;t gotten so I had to flag down a waiter then ask for more and then ask for more and then ask again. We literally had to ask a minimum of three times for anything. The meat came out in small, small portions (first two rounds came out with 2 strips of galbi, then it dwindled down to 1 strip per order). And between each order there was at least a 15 minute wait. An hour after we had first ordered, my husband and I still hadn&#39;t been able to eat (bc the small amount of food that trickled out had been given to our hungry 6 year old). I was so upset I went up to the owner to let him know what was going on. He mumbled some excuse about being short staffed and said that they had been unexpectedly short staffed the night before, too. Two days in a row?! Why didn&#39;t he call in some extra staff then? Then as if to make me feel better, he told me I had two hours for AYCE so to take my time and keep eating. ARRRGGHHH! What kind of response is that? It was an infuriating experience and with the plethora of KBBQ options in Ktown I definitely won&#39;t be back to deal with this ridiculous lackluster service."

We got there early, a quarter to 12, place was not even 1/4 full.  30 min into waiting for our food while savoring the small dishes, which were good, 3 tables left the restaurant.  We thought it was due to the long wait for food.   40 mins into still waiting for our food, we asked waitress and then she &#34;bothered&#34; to then let us know that the 3 dishes that had a combo of kalbi and cold noodles, they ran out of cold noodles . ....  what???    The waiter that took our order never came back ro check on us.  So those that ordered cold noodles changed their order...ok.... 10 min later, their tofu hot pot dish came out, but my stew dish and my daughter&#39;s beef and radish stew were forgotten....   We then cancelled our two orders, ate what came out and left.   went to the restroom and saw that while our table was left forgotten, other many other tables that had ordered bbq meats were fully serviced...  what the.....

We&#39;ve been here before but we noticed that it was under new management. They still have the valet parking for $2 but the inside was beautifully renovated.

The food was great as well, very tasty and the staff was very friendly. The price was a little expensive compare to other korean bbq establishment but the food was well worth it. We don&#39;t even need to do anything, they will cook the meat in front of you so you can enjoy your food.

It takes away the chew on the good quality nicely marbled meat. Because of all the slices on the meat (front and back it seems) was wayy too tender.

They had a fresh modern look but not as many people as we expected due to a delayed alcohol licensing issue. Apparently the previous owners lied...

My hubby ordered the galbitang and I ordered the mul naengmyun and tteok galbi combo. The galbitang was plentiful meat and the broth was masterfully prepared (=). The mul naeng myun broth is great as well. Both broths were really good with no msg taste. Both our ancesters are from North Korea and not used to foods tasting so sweet and syruppy. We have very picky taste buds and can taste forced tastes from foreign invaders like msg...but this place had great tasting foods. The side dishes () was very tasty as well with ample varieties. Tteok galbi melted in the mouth. All the 2 small/medium pieces. 

The meat dishes are over $40/ so with our 3 carnivores, wouldn&#39;t be ideal place. However, this would be very nice place to bring family or guests to show off excellent Korean food and great quality."

The portions are massive and can feed a group of people. We went with a large order of menudo and another large order of birria. Being the glutton that I am, I also ordered lengua sopes.

When everything came out, we immediately went to town on the heavenly goodness. Menudo is literally Mexican penicillin, relieving everything from a common cold to that massive hangover of yours from having a few too many drinks the night before.

Everything was cooked perfectly and tasted just like homemade Mexican grub you&#39;d expect to have at a friend&#39;s place!

Parking can be a bit tough. Drop someone off first so they can line up (the line is super long on weekend mornings).

I also got a cup of coffee, which was an amazing choice because it was Mexican coffee! It had a hint of cinnamon! The food was great and delicious. The sope was crispy and the lengua was soft. The service was a bit slow but the food was fantastic. If you order the tamales and menudo, they come out fast.

We saw multiple families coming in with pots and filling them up and leaving, it was pretty family oriented.

 The people working the cash register and behind the grill were really friendly. Asked for a menu and ordered a carne asada burrito and it only cost me $6.54. They had tacos, menudo and other stuff at good prices as well. It was cash only but the price was definitely worth it. Pretty nice size burrito (close to a Chipotle size burrito) and tasted great! Really nice flavor on the protein mixed in with rice, beans, onions and cilantro. I think it was one of the best burritos I&#39;ve had in a really long time!

My grandmother fed me most of my meals, I grew eating chorizo con huevos regularly, the best frijoles north of the border, hand made flour tortillas was a daily treat, fideo several times a week, menudo just about every weekend &amp; hand made tamales on every holiday season &amp; just about every Mexican dish you could dream of, I thought this was the norm for everyone. Then In 1984 I left to the service &amp; little did I know all of this delicious food I took for granite would soon be a thing of the past. 

When I was discharged 4years later my elderly grandmother could no longer cook quite the same, sadly shortly later she left us. Ever since I have been trying to find all the delicious food she cooked for me as a child. I searched every hole in the wall in East LA, drove across the border regularly, &amp; one of my life missions was to find a home cooked Mexican meal that would come close to my grandma&#39;s food. To this day I have not found it, but this place is about as close as it gets. 

This place is literally someone&#39;s old house. The dining &amp; family rooms is where meals are now served. I ordered the huevos rancheros &amp; there were pretty close to my grandmas. I also ordred to tacos de barbocoa which were amazing! The place is tiny, cozy &amp; has that home feeling for me at least. I believe it is all one family running the place &amp; everything is made from scratch. The menudo looked exactly like I remember as a kid. The corn tortillas were home made. The salsa was very tasty &amp; like everything else made from scratch. 

I heard some people raving about the al pastor &amp; it looked amazing, but the truth is I never tried it but will be doing so on my next visit.

There is no parking lot so you will have to park on the street. Do not expect anything fancy, if you do you will be very disappointed. But if your looking for some good old fashion home made Mexican food, look no more &amp; check out Los Tres Cochinitos!

Abuela, gracias por todo lo que hizo por m√≠ cuando yo era un ni√±o peque√±o. Nunca me olvidar√© de ti. Me gustar√≠a poder abrazarte una vez m√°s. Lo siento por todos los problemas que caus√©. Te amo y te ver√© pronto.

4.5 stars. This is truly an authentic home style recipe.

BIRRIA
3 stars. They seem to be known for the birria, it&#39;s the soup/caldo type, but that&#39;s too wet and messey for me. This type may very well be a 4-5 for someone else. 

AMBIANCE
This place is truly a &#34;hole in the wall&#34;. Not too small, may be a little cramped, and might have to wait a little, but well worth it. Everyone is friendly and they aim to serve you quickly. 

PRICE
You can&#39;t beat the prices, extremely cheap.

Can&#39;t wait to return for other items on the menu."

A quick search on Yelp and I found a promising spot - Los Tres Cochinitos.  All 13 reviews on Yelp were 5 stars so I was looking forward to this adventure.

The place was very quaint &amp; clean and the vibe is super casual.  I ordered the chicharon burrito and sad to say I think I made a HUGE mistake.  It wasn&#39;t good at all.  I couldn&#39;t even eat 1/3 of it and that&#39;s saying a lot.  I hate wasting food and my cheapness usually forces me to eat what I buy.  With this burrito, unfortunately, I was willing to take a loss on.  I mean I know chicharon is suppose to be fatty but I was also expecting some meat on it and have it fried to a crispy perfection.  WRONG!  It was basically just soggy hunk of fat rolled with dried rice and bland beans.  

I guess I should&#39;ve stuck with their specialty which seems to be the menudo, barbacoa, and asada!

I might go back to give them another chance but I won&#39;t be rushing to do it anytime soon.  I guess back to searching on Yelp for lunch today.  I&#39;m still hungry!  Ugh!!!"

They serve food until they run out. All food is cooked that morning and served as orders. My #1 recommendation is their birria. They serve it as a soup, small or large, or as a shallow bowl if you like more birria than soup. A good place to visit if you partied the night before. Make sure to show up before they run out which on weekends tends to be around 2pm."

Most other weekends I will settle for something because of proximity, lack of time, or the lack of motivation due to the toll of the previous night. But last weekend my wife and I decided to venture out of our neighborhood and try something else. The restaurant is more or less a family style joint that serves up some serious authentic dishes. The menudo was perfect. The broth was savory and had all the flavor you expect. The hominy to tripe ratio leans heavily towards the tripe. They serve it in large or small bowls and it comes with a pata. Like I said, the menudo is perfect."

Four stars for flavor and substance. 
Zero stars for looks and cleanliness.  They should consider serving the fresh oregano and onion as needed instead of just refilling and moving the tray from one party to another...I can&#39;t imagine it&#39;s very hygienic

Cruda or not I come, I sit, I sweat it out and enjoy it. This is a place where you see the old timers in sombreros and handkerchiefs.
When it comes to service this is some of the best I&#39;ve experienced and service is not a first and foremost for me.
One morning I came for menudo and they ran out of pata. I was sad but good menudo is good menudo so I ordered mine but I&#39;m sure the lady who took my order sensed my disappointment. When my menudo came she managed to scrape together some nice bits of pata in a separate bowl. She absolutely did not have to, but she did and this was amazing.
I&#39;ve had several dishes here and they are all well cooked and flavorful.
The servings are substantial.
The service is authentically courteous and pleasant. None of the fake corporate enforced smiles or hoop jumping for business. If you&#39;re into that sort of thing this place isn&#39;t for you. Be nice, get nice.
Find parking on the street.
This morning I came in about 8:30 am. Some borrachos across the street were popping cans and singing songs. Legit as F***.
It gets a little warm in here so people who want to eat in the lap of luxury can go somewhere else. More for everyone else!

I ordered the Smoked Salmon Sandwich. It tastes how you would imagine it would taste but I would&#39;ve preferred if they had a little bit more condiments on the inside since the salmon made the sandwich a bit salty.

However, the espresso was nice and strong, so I had to try again. The Vanilla latte was perfect, all things done right, strong espresso and the right amount of vanilla, not too sweet. Loved it. 

After I ordered the toast, the girl preparing the food realized they were out of pesto, but no worries, because she was so cool and did her best to accommodate me, even letting me try some other savory spreads to see what I might like instead. I went with the green mayo, and asked her to only put a little and she listened. The toast was delicious, and with the bread they use, one slice was plenty. I didn&#39;t get the girls name who prepared the food (Homeboy Industry shirt under her apron), but I want to stress how nice and attentive she was, also very down-to-earth, which for me was a breath of fresh air.

The shop itself is pretty cool, it&#39;s small, but I liked the set up and loved the music they were playing, a little bit of everything. I would definitely come here again when in they area, and it helps to know that the parking structure with the giant $20 sign is only $2 for two hours at Impresso with validation."

It&#39;s really cute, and there&#39;s a lot of countertop space and natural lighting, so it&#39;s a winner in my book. Parking is metered street, which is typical. 

I tried the impresso sweet latte, which is essentially a latte sweetened with condensed milk. I don&#39;t think the concept of that drink is that unique anymore, but it was still good. Drinks are on the pricier side, especially for the size, and even more so if you&#39;re partial to milk substitutions. They serve food here too, but I didn&#39;t get a chance to try anything, so no comment on that. 

tldr- cute space for catching up with friends or for studying in downtown!"

Please mr or mrs owner find some other bread, i think if it was a thick slice of brioche, nicely toasted, it would change everything.

I am french and it hurts me when i taste bad bread like that.

Impresso was a quick favorite upon only one visit. Why? Because they had so many things I love here: open faced toasts, lavender lattes, &amp; a sweet looking logo. 

Oh I&#39;m sorry, they also have free wi-fi. Which is perfection. 

Came here on a whim when my best friend and I were in a search of new cafes to keep up our study and work grind at. Also, we&#39;re obsessed with toast. So there was that and if you hadn&#39;t looked at their business photos yet, then let me warn you.. You will crave for a toast. 

We tried out the Strawberry Poppy toast and a Pesto-Ricotta toast. Great looking toasts. Both filled with flavors from edge to edge. Appealing to the eye and the stomach. Their toast is thick, wasn&#39;t burnt (thank goodness!), and had just the right amount of crunch. My toast was paired with a lavender latte which I have been a sucker for everywhere I go! Impresso definitely impressed me with their lavender latte. Not too floral tasting but very smooth and sweet. It made for a beautiful productive morning. It was also raining around the time I went and I remember my friend and I thought what a perfect coffeeshop find! 

My one remark is their price. Toasts were about $7-$8? Lattes were about $5. I mean, there&#39;s so many coffeeshops with their prices ranging a little on the higher side yet we still go because the experience of it all is still pretty solid. 

Had my toast, latte, and an issue of the Downtowner along with my best friend. The high prices were just a small downside but it didn&#39;t ruin the trip. It&#39;s best that Impresso isn&#39;t too close to me or else a good portion of my wallet would be going to them. It also should make every trip there a little more worthwhile. 

Looking forward to my next visit. 

See you soon, origami rhino!"

The flavors were explosive and delectable. There is also a good amount of space to do work, plug in, and enjoy the vibe. One thing (out of their control) was the neighboring workout classes...thin walls. The instructor could have led us too. Not a huge deal, but one customer did walk out after unpacking her things.

So to save all of you the trouble, the parking lot for Impresso is actually in the alley way on 11th street and its valet parking only. But don&#39;t you worry, with validation its only $2.

I had tried their Pesto-Ricotta toast with Avocado (add $1) and it was pretty decent. It smelled really fresh and citrus-y with the lemon zest. But I think I wouldn&#39;t have liked it as much if I hadn&#39;t added avocado to it. The flavor was simple and subtle in a good way but it&#39;s not memorable enough for me to want to come back for it again. 

Aside from that, their service was great and it&#39;s a cute little place to catch up with friends or just to get some studying done."

Service was friendly and peppy - and food was tasty.

+ Pesto-Ricotta toast w/ Avocado (add $1) - Perfect meal to start the day. I LOVE the lemon zest. Gives the whole thing a really fresh quality. The avocado is VERY NECESSARY, even at a dollar more, it just completes it. I&#39;m not sure it was worth the price, but I would definitely re-make this meal at home.

+ Breakfast Egg burger - Loved the brioche bun! It was squishy and soft, and the egg at the center was expertly prepared with the oozy cheese. 

+ Chicken Tortilla Soup - This was the soup of the day. It was really  nice and flavorful, with a surprising kick. I wish it had some tortilla chips or croutons to give it more texture though. Overall, a very hearty and delicious soup.

+ French Toast - Not my favorite, but it&#39;s good. Something was missing, I&#39;m not sure what."

I came on a Friday afternoon/night and it was pretty quiet. Granted it did rain a lot before so people were probably staying at home. 

We parked at the lot right next to the garage on the left of Impresso ($10 all day). 

Walked in and were greeted right away by the barista. She helped me figure out what kind of drink I wanted since it was my first time there. She recommended the Impresso Sweet Latte which tastes just as it sounds. It was pretty good. It was a perfect amount of sweetness for me. My boyfriend got the nitro brew which was really good. And it was a good price for nitro brew! 

I highly recommend the almond danish. It was SO GOOD. It was like a sweet danish. 

Wifi is good, and the place is very well kept. Another employee comes around to take empty dishes from customers and wipe down tables or restock items. 

Lots of seating available. Not too sure about outlets. I sat by the entrance against the long table and there were a couple of outlets right behind us. 

Great customer service, clean place, and great menu items. Don&#39;t know when I&#39;ll be back but hopefully when dtla parking gets better T_T"

The bf discovered this place on Yelp (where else?) and wanted to try their iced banana mocha, so we headed over on a sunny Sunday morning. Located next to Coco, on Hope and across from the Luma Lofts. Parking was free on Sundays so it was easy to find :)

The banana mocha was good and the bf liked it. I got a matcha latte, which was very pleasantly green, but on the sweeter side. Prices are a bit on the higher side, but they have free wifi (yay!), clean and modern space for you to sit and stay, unisex bathroom, infused water! I also really liked that the Hope Street parklet was right outside so we enjoyed our drinks out there for a little bit.

Ordered:
*blueberry maple toast $6 this was my favorite thing that I tried here. So definitely would recommend this open face toast. 
*egg burger with bacon $6 + $1 bacon - skip it if I were you. It&#39;s really just 2 buns, a very thin slice of ham (think like deli thin), cheese, and bacon. Wasn&#39;t worth it personally! 
*ginger &amp; grapefruit toast $6- my gfs really liked this. I was skeptical at first but to my surprise it was better than expected. I mean who in the world would think that the combination of ginger and grapefruit would go well together. I would say order it as its gonna be pretty rare to find another place that will make such a treat.  
*french toast w pistachio gelato $8 - nothing crazy. Gelato as expected did melt pretty fast. 

Overall, I loved the way the presentation of the food. Good concept that is new and creative! Place was clean. Staff cleaned the tables right away when someone leaves. Food came out at a timely manner. Overall, impresso was a solid three stars. Wouldn&#39;t personally come out of my way to come back here. But if you&#39;re in the area I would say it doesn&#39;t hurt to pay them a visit. 

Tips:
Parking structure $10 or meter parking. 
Accept cash or credit. 
Offers the 5 star reward program. 
Limited indoor &amp; outdoor seating. 
Offers free infused water.

Also, there is cute outside seating that look like benches.. There are also a bunch of other food/drink places around this area.

The sizes of their drinks are also very generous. The cups are pretty big. I got the lavender latte and it was delicious! There are lavender flower bits sprinkled on top which makes the drink look kinda cute.. but it&#39;s a little bitter if you eat the flowers. It didn&#39;t bother me but some people might not like it.

Although it seems like cafes are starting to take over the world, DTLA has had an alarming amount pop up in the last year.

Sure, prices are a little inflated but you can&#39;t account for quality, baby!

Came in the first time on MLK Jr. Day and the place was pretty empty. There were only two staff members (cashier &amp; barista) in the front. But they were both very friendly and weren&#39;t doing what you see most employees doing when there&#39;s not a lot of customers: standing around, chatting, and not doing a damn thing. It was nice to see that they were taking care of their areas and (I think) stocking their supplies. When I finally came to somewhat of a decision, the cute cashier was more than ready to give me suggestions and answer my ridiculous questions -all the while she was smiling AND waiting patiently. These are the kind of people you as a business owner want in your store and as a customer helping you.

Didn&#39;t have a chance to pick anything up to eat but their menu sounds delicious and has a nice variety going on. I can&#39;t wait to try that Strawberry-Poppy Open Face. (I&#39;ll update this once I try some of their menu.)

Thankfully I was with another person and used that as an excuse to order two drinks:
- Lavender Latte $5
I like that this isn&#39;t overly fragrant. It&#39;s got a nice subtle lavender scent and flavor to it. What I didn&#39;t like was constantly having to catch the pieces of lavender garnish before I choked on them. But I&#39;d order this again and try it iced.

- Iced Impresso Sweet Latte $5
 I liked this a lot more than I thought I would. It isn&#39;t nearly as sweet as it sounds, having the word in its name and all.

Gotta love that they have a good amount of coffee, teas, hot, iced, blended, etc. I&#39;m getting that Earl Grey Creme Latte next time..

Great location! Easily walkable from the &#34;other side&#34; of DTLA (like 7th St &amp; Spring St). Right across from the EVO condos and next to The Briks on Hope St &amp; 11th St. And just a short walk away from the Staples Center. 

On both sides of the street are meters and the ones in front of Impresso are only $0.25/30 minutes (but check to be sure, it was a Monday when we went.), they take quarters, dollar coins, card, and there&#39;s an app or something you can pay with too. 

Oh yeah, there&#39;s free WiFi for those of you looking for a nice place to get some work done or just relax with your apps. (:"

Apparently their cold brew is top notch, so the worker suggested that I come in a few hours later to give it a try but my schedule didn&#39;t permit that. Their menu seemed to offer a lot of variety in terms of the drinks and food, and they had pastries as well. Too bad my usual go-to&#39;s are cold brews and pour overs instead of flavored drinks. My friend got the earl grey creme latte and loved it, so I would recommend that! 

The ambience was nice and the space was tidy, so that was welcoming. Their logo design is so simple and cute!

There aren&#39;t a ton of outlets but it also isn&#39;t very crowded so you&#39;ll find ample seating.

I&#39;ve had the iced banana mocha ($5), open faced ricotta and pesto toast ($6), green pomegranate tea ($4) and prosciutto and fig sandwich with a small side salad ($12). The food portions are tiny but solidly yummy. The drinks are splendid. The mocha could&#39;ve used a bit more banana, but subtlety is key here. The green pomegranate tea is also very subtle and refreshing. It&#39;s &#34;award winning&#34; too, whatever that means. My girlfriend had the blendissimo ($5.50) which is like a coffee float--so delicious. 

Street parking is available; avoid the structure/lot which I saw was $10. 

Make sure to use your Five Stars account. After my first visit, I received a coupon for 1/2 off any drink on my second visit! So naturally, I came back the very next day and redeemed it. Such smart marketing lol."

Saigon coffee - I had better Vietnamese coffee
Blendimissimo - Typical blended ice coffee taste just like Starbucks Fraps
Green Pomegranate - Taste just like ice green tea
Smoked Salmon - Nothing to brag about. Let&#39;s just say I could go to Trader&#39;s Joe. Get the bacon smoked salmon and put my sandwich together.
French Toast - It was soggy not cooked long enough
Cheese Crumble Danish - It was a decent tasteful danish"

This is a great place to study at or catch up with a few friends over coffee. We came on a rainy Tuesday afternoon and it was so lovely to be in here rather than outside in the dreary weather.

What we ordered:
Earl Grey creme latte - very milky with just a slight Earl Grey flavor. Recommend for those who prefer tea/au laits over coffee. I didn&#39;t get any latte art for this though :(

Lavender latte - wonderfully fragrant without being overpoweringly &#34;lavender&#34;. It was really good! Got latte art with this one! :D

They&#39;ve got wifi and I think there are outlets at every table so its perfect for getting work done. The space is quite small though so I imagine they&#39;ll run out of tables quickly once this place gets more popular - get here early if you want to sit in!"

Don&#39;t remember what my order was called but all you have to know is all their toasts are $6. Given it was really good toast, good customer service, and a cute cafe, prices are forgiven. 

Will I be back again? Maybe if I&#39;m stuck in DTLA with my laptop and have $10 to spare. Seeing as I&#39;m never caught in this type of situation, probably not. No wow factor, but a nice spot to check out if you&#39;re in the area."

Brioche bun was a little too much, the whole ratio was really off. Too much bun to the stuff that was inside... Egg was runny, but $6 was a little steep.

Then on to the cold brew...it tasted like burnt coffee and was pretty nasty. I love Black Coffee, but this flavor was either too intentionally funky or off. After I told the barista, she just kind of stood there and &#34;taught&#34; me that the cold brew was a little bitter because of its brewing method.  Didn&#39;t do anything to resolve the problem

It&#39;s still in soft opening so it was relatively empty when I came on a Wednesday morning. I love lavender flavored drinks so I decided to try the lavender latte. The lavender flavor is subtle and the drink itself is not overly sweet which I liked! 

Negatives: For $5 ($6 after tax and tip), the drink is pretty small.

However, it&#39;s conveniently located to me, and I dislike Starbucks (and I&#39;m too lazy to walk to Philz) so I&#39;m definitely coming back. I&#39;m already eyeing the matcha tea latte, the iced banana mocha, and the earl grey creme latte. Can&#39;t wait to try all the flavors and the food!

A few blocks from our hotel (the JW Marriott) we found Impresso.  It is a darling space on Hope next to a spin studio of sorts.  The space is clean and bright - oddly sterile but welcoming.  They have a simple and straight forward menu and a small case of pastries.  There is also a case of cold drinks if you fancy.  On our first visit I had the lavender latte and a chocolate croissant, which they can warm for you. Both were absolutely delicious.  The lavender was just enough and the crosissant was crisp and light similar to ones I&#39;ve had in Paris.  The second visit I had the Impresso Sweet Latte which is sweetened with condensed milk and dusted with brown sugar.  We also had the banana hazelnut open faced toast and the pesto ricotta toast.  Both were delicious.  Service is nice and quick.  There are a few high top tables, a bar top and a communal table with succulents and local papers on them.  Making it a quick stop in the morning.
Lattes range at $5 and toasts are $6.  A bit of a splurge but a good one."

Now, it&#39;s almost always crowded, especially during lunch hours and the weekends where it&#39;s impossible to get a table or even a seat. The kitchen is always out of ingredients, but charge the same price for substitutes. The last three times I was there, they were out of brioche bun for the egg burger and had to use toast instead. 

Impresso started out as a great workplace (free WiFi, peace and quiet) but that&#39;s quickly changed (I seriously blame Yelp). I still recommend it for those in the area who want to grab a quick bite. If you&#39;re looking to get some work done though, maybe find a place elsewhere."

My problem is paying for higher priced Thai food when I can drive 10 minutes to Thai town in Hollywood where you can feed 4 people for $40. This place can be about $40 per person with drinks and the food is just ok.

My friend suggested we go and it was for a special occassion so I was open to spending money but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth the price. My friend called it a hipster Thai restaurant. I prefer going to the Thai restaurants where 80% of patrons are actually Thai.

But after eating here, I was a little underwhelmed.

Location:
This Pok Pok is located in Chinatown and has a parking lot where you can pay 5$. Other than that, there is some street parking nearby.

Ambience:
Pok Pok definitely has a 70&#39;s retro interior. They have a bar with seats as well as a lot of tables both inside the restaurant and on the patio.

Staff:
The staff is helpful and attentive.

Food:
I know it&#39;s boring to start off a review of food with water, but the water here is infused with a slight coconut flavor, which I found was a pleasant surprise.

Pok Pok is well known for their fish sauce chicken wings and they did not disappoint. They may be too salty for some, but being Southeast Asian and growing up on fish sauce, they were delicious. They had a good sticky texture and an amazing savory/sweet-and-sour flavor profile.

However, after the fish sauce wings, I wasn&#39;t all that impressed. The papaya salad (Papaya Pok Pok) was okay. It was a simply papaya salad that had a nice spicy kick to it. But half of it was a just a 1/4 cut of whole cabbage, which my group didn&#39;t really know what to do with.

We also ordered Kaeng Hang Leh (pork curry) and Kung Op Wun Sen (prawns and pork belly baked in a clay pot with thread noodles). The pork curry was pretty good, but there wasn&#39;t much meat in it. The prawns and noodles however tasted sort of bland.

Overall, Pok Pok serves okay Thai food but at a sort of steep price given the portion size. But I do hear that the Pok Pok in Portland is way better than the one in LA, so keep that in mind if you&#39;re ever in Portland! 3/5 stars"

Did it leave early? Was I late? Maybe I was on the wrong platform.  Was it not Platform nine and three-quarters? Meh, wizardry school is rubbish anyways. 

Speaking of wizardry it&#39;s straight witchcraft that there&#39;s always a one-two hour wait here.  With that much seating inside, upstairs, and outside you would think it would be a factory there pumping out customers left and right.  I called in and they said there&#39;s no opening for two hours inside and when I got there the place was half empty.

Hold the Salt

Hot diggity this food is saltier than Hagrid&#39;s Prairie Oysters or maybe even salty as Headless Nick&#39;s huevos de toro! As an avid fan of fish sauce I tend to eat it a lot of it but if their most well-known dish (Chicken wings) used the whole bottle on it, better order 4 Thai teas to offset the salt.

The Price is (Not) Right

I&#39;m usually okay with 10-25% mark up on food, but if the food is 25-50% marked up there better gold plated dishes and the service better be impeccable.  Most entree dishes range in the $15 range for small portions while the restaurant is aimed to be for &#34;commoners&#34; and street style food of Thailand.  Boo.  

How am i supposed to buy all my Harry Potter fan hear if I&#39;m wasting it on hyped up Thai?!"

* Price: expensive for the area and for thai food. $15 for 5 pieces of chicken wings! 3 star.
* Ambiance: imagine if you are in thailand! The decor is totally a good reminiscence of throwback 70&#39;s movie in Asia! 3 star.
* Location: Mandarin plaza of the end of China town. There is paid parking for $5. You can also find a parking on the streets. 3 star.
* Meals: most of the dishes are very creative and tasty! 4+ star.
* Service: our server, Bryce is very pleasant, attentive and friendly but some other staff is very intimidating when we came to the restaurant without reservation! Our server makes it better! 4 star.

This is averaged to 3.5 star.

We went to this restaurant in person once but were scolded by the front staff for not having reservation. Since then, we mostly order online and pick up.  

Most dishes have thai&#39;s name and very authentic which what we expect from a James Beard Award chef. 

Pok pok special, $19: roasted half chicken with a side papaya salad. This is my favorite dish by far. The chichen is perfectly roasted with flavor, very moist and tender! We have ordered this dish online and it tastes just as fresh as at the restaurant.

Hoi thawt, $13: broken crepe with mussles, eggs, garlic chives and bean sprouts, served with sriracha. It&#39;s just OK. It is more like scramble eggs with mussles!

Khao Man Son Tam, $13.50: papaya salad with shredded pork, served with rice. This dish is pretty good. It is a bit different from most papaya salad since it is served with pork instead of shrimps. 

Spicy wings $15.50: these wings are delish! Marinated with fish sauce, brown sugar and chilli peper... Very tasty and super spicy! It is a bit spendy for wings though! 

Steam fish, $29: a whole fish, steam with fish sauce, ginger, chilly pepper and veggie. It is perfectly seasoned, moist and spicy! 

For desserts, we had affogato and ice cream sandwich. 
Affogato, $7.50: ice cream served with a shot of Vietnamese coffee and thai crispy cruller... It is pretty tasty and will keep you up all night either from coffee or sugar high!

Coconut ice cream sanwich,$7: coconut-jackfruit ice cream served on sweet peanut bun, sticky rice, condensed milk and chocolate syrup... Can&#39;t you say too much of good things?! It is really tasty though... But you probably will be on treadmill for the next 2 weeks!

Overall, the food is excellent, excited minus the difficult pronunciation dishes... The price is a bit spendy! I guess this is what you paid for culinary adventure without taking your adventure to Thailand!"

To put it succinctly, the service was horrible. We were a large group (party of 7) and when we arrived, the waiter told us there was no place to seat such a large group. We asked to be split into smaller groups instead but he told us that wouldn&#39;t be possible either. In the end, we decided to order our food to-go so that we could eat outside on the empty tables, but apparently that wasn&#39;t allowed either.

 To make matters worse, the server was stand-offish, rude, and dismissive the entire time. He was extremely slow in taking our orders, and not accommodating at all. 

That being said, we were quite happy with our order of the chicken wings once the food finally came. Only saving grace about this place. Would not come back in a million years."

The spicy honey soy wings- flavorful but less meat. It&#39;s mostly the deep fried skin you&#39;re eating. It was not even spicy. 

Pork belly pork shoulder curry- it&#39;s a total rip of Chinese and Taiwanese braised pork. There&#39;s more fat than any meat. I did not taste any curry in there. There was only 4 pieces to be exact. A tiny meat piece for 4 people, ridiculous.

The baby back ribs- super American! Was not the best I have had. It was rare and plain.

Rices- coconut rice was good at least and jasmine rice and sticky rice was another option they gave you. 

Service was good but I would rather not come back for the food and prices are double the norm for Thai food. I suggest going to Thai town."

Who the fuck give you Napa cabbage and useless mints that confuses the whole dish  to wrap the undressed salmon dish that is a wanna be a larb salad.

App: clam salty broth . - Edible - taste like instant noodle powered broth.

Whole chicken: better at el polo loco
Catfish - don&#39;t order / terrible 
Whole fish special: nothing special /

The tables are covered in this beautiful ready-for-Instagram printed cover, there is Thai country music playing in the background, and they give you coconut water in carafes. 

Now the food? As a Thai-American speaking here, it&#39;s ranges between not bad to excellent. Nothing we ordered was offensive or poorly prepared. Props to Andy Ricker for creating a menu that falls outside of Thai Cuisine&#39;s Greatest Hits.

Ike&#39;s Fish Sauce wings were good, 6 pretty big wings in a sweet and savory sticky glaze. We ordered spicy but it was more &#34;white people spicy.&#34; The raw herbs and pickled vegetables were good at complementing the richness of the dish.

Yum Makheau Eggplant salad was interesting. It was smoky and came with pork and dried shrimp to add umami. I thought it tasted pretty good and it was unique.

Yum Neau (Beef Salad) was excellent. Good balance between sweet, smoky, sour, and savory, and the steak was of great quality.

Why two stars? All three dishes plus one cocktail amounted to $75 (including tax and tip). You can call me an entitled millennial or tell me that I&#39;m the reason that Yelp sucks as much as you want, but I&#39;m sorry, that is an obscene amount of money to pay for 3 dishes and a cocktail.

This is Los Angeles. You can literally get most of the same dishes at a fraction of the cost 6 MILES away on Hollywood.

It&#39;s less a Thai restaurant and more of a white man&#39;s effort to prove that he can cook good Thai food. Yes, Andy, you can cook good Thai food. But if you&#39;re serving me the SAME stuff as my Thai uncles and aunties, then your white privilege should not give you the right to markup prices.

 If you reinterpreted Thai food and elevated it (see Nahm in Bangkok) then I&#39;d feel ok paying $15-$20 for dishes. But don&#39;t cheat this angry cheap Asian.

Parking structure is on the side and is open until 2am.  I came here for a friend&#39;s birthday.  We had about 15 people in our party and they had a good little spot tucked away for us.  I definitely recommend this place for groups.  They were kind and accommodating.  They even sliced the birthday cake I brought.  The food was delicious.  Here&#39;s what we had:

Ik&#39;s Vietnamese Fish sauce Chicken wings - They are glazed in Vietnamese fish sauce and sugar.  Sticky and frikkin delicious.  If you get them spicy, prepare to sweat.

Deep-fried marinated buffalo (Neua Khwai Sawan) -  Tasty, so fully of flavor but just a tad bit too tough and dry for me

Naem Sii Khrong Muu Thawt - deep-fried por riblets and served with a side of cabbage, peanuts, ginger and chilies

Papaya Salad - super spicy!

Sii Khrong Muu Yaang - Baby back ribs - exactly as described not fall apart but full of flavor. If you dont mind gristle too much, you&#39;ll like these

Muu Paa Kham Waan - Boar collar meat, super tasty but I didn&#39;t necessarily feel the mustard greens covered in crushed ice served much of a purpose. No offense.

Sai Ua Samun Phrai - Chiang Mai sausage with herbs - delicious but that green chile sauce to dip it in was one of those sauces you will remember forever.

Kaeng Hang Leh - Northern Thai sweet pork belly and pork shoulder curry - this dish was everything!  I am very fond of Northern Thai cuisine, the best I&#39;ve had is definitely Spicy BBQ on Santa Monica and Normandie. This was my first time having this particular dish which is very special. The pork is super tender and decadent.  The curry is phenomenal.  It tasted like it has been stewed for hours.  Highly recommend!

The menu can be a bit intimidating your first time.  I suggest you look at the pictures and menu on their website ahead of time if you want to be guided.

Their cocktails are also outta sight.  My favorite was just the Pok Pok Gin and Tonic.  It was so light and refreshing and went very well with the food. I do agree that the service could have been less slow.  It took a while for everything to come out but we were a large group it was a busy night so I will definitely give them the benefit of the doubt and come back for that amazing Kaeng Hang Leh."

I understand this is very good Thai resto brand in Portland.  When coming in, the vibe is cool and funky,  nice and comfy, South Asian looking tableplastic and a really good bar.  There were some issues:  first I wanted to sit in an area that was empty and was told the wait person working there has not come in yet.  Fine, no problem.  Two minutes later our waitperson arrived, she served us and then went over to the same area 15 minutes later and served tables there...... so whatever. 

The  food.

Food was good.  Not exceptional.   Here are the dishes we had.

Mary&#39;s chicken-- delish, simple, skin crispy, good.  It came with 2 sauces.  Good and better than most Thai BBQ joints. 

Pork Shoulder and pork belly curry-  good, not very pronounced curry flavor, our most successful dish as it was not as firey as most curries go but again, needed more flavor and less sugar.  I don&#39;t like sugar in &#39;savory&#39; Thai dishes and this plate definitely had it in abundance.  Not appetizing.  When I want curry I expect savory not sweet notes tiptoeing across the dish. 

Eggplant salad, the eggplant needed a bit more grilling, it didn&#39;t that familiar char, smoky taste. It tasted  boiled.. Not impressed, salad was simple, but could have been more flavorful.  It needed more fish sauce, a bit more tart. 

Sticky rice with mango-- sticky rice was dry in some places that&#39;s noticeable. The person behind the rice cooker is not testing doneness. The coconut sauce was watered down and more salty. Not good. 

There really was nothing glaringly wrong with the food but it seemed toned down, the chef unfamiliar with the simple yet bold flavors of Thai food. The sugar has gotta go.  Verdict?   Pok Pok is a crafted brand.   Maybe living in El-Lay makes me a Thai food snob but the dishes we had tonight fell short of what I consider authentic Thai flavors one experiences from Yai or Ruen Pair, or Lum Ka Naad.    So even though this is close to me as it&#39;s on the edge of Chinatown and close to the 110 Freeway, I will most likely be driving to Hollywood for Thai.  But I will visit Pok Pok LA one more time to be fair.

Visits: 1

Tip:  Lots of street parking.  Good cocktail menu."

The wings were disappointingly dry. The sauce on them was great however. I heard they use a really good small batch vinegar. 

They give you leaf steeped water that tastes salty. I thought it was the glass, so don&#39;t be thrown off, I just wasn&#39;t expecting it.

Overall, for the price, I thought the quality didn&#39;t match up."

Tablecloths are super cool. See my instagram! @hairdresser007

Try the tamarind vinegar drink it&#39;s tasty and refreshing goes well with the flavors. 

Don&#39;t remember the names but had the steak salad, the baked pork belly pot and a pork and egg appetizer ( not my fave) and coconut rice.

Came here with some friends on a Thursday night. We were still waiting for two more friends so we got some beer and ordered the Ike&#39;s Vietnamese Fish Sauce wings - extra spicy.  OMG these are bomb!!  So crispy, spicy and yummy that we had to order a second plate!

My friends and I all shared a Da Chom&#39;s Laap Meuang (minced pork salad), the Laap Thawt Isaan (deep fried pork laap) and the Phat Hoi Lai (frieds clams).  We got a side of coconut rice (which I&#39;m not a huge fan of but was still very good).  Oh man, everything was so tasty, had the right amount of spice and I could not stop eating - I was literally stuffed afterwards.  So good, would definitely come back if just for some wings!!"

Food is of South East Asia origin so things are a bit spicier than your typical Thai place. Some of the food can be ordered &#39;mild&#39; as your server for more details. Food here is made to be shared and enjoyed, not so much photographed. Lighting at the restaurant is not ideal for photo taking either, I had to use flash for all my photos. 

Below is a breakdown of each dish we had:

Shrimp chips
This is definitely one of those things you would snack on while drinking and not so much something you would start with if you were starving. These chips taste similar to the ones you purchase from the Asian supermarkets. 

Cashew Nuts
Salted and stir fried with chives and red chillies. Avoid the chillies if you want to avoid the heat.

Ike&#39;s Chicken Wings
Finger-licking good. Packed full of flavor. Lived up to the hype. 
So nice they give you a bowl for bones and wet wipes for the clean up afterwards.

Mary&#39;s Roasted Chicken
Nothing particularly special about this roasted chicken. The true tastiness comes in the sauces. Try the tamarind one.

Flank Steak Salad
Very tasty....more of a meat dish than salad. The only &#39;salad&#39; part would be the parsley and onions it comes with. 

Broken Crepe
Filled with mussels and both interior and exterior lived up to its salty reputation. Paired well with sticky or Jasmine rice to offset the saltiness.

Affogato
The coffee it came with was very strong but paired well with the ice cream it was poured over. The doughnuts it came with are similar to the Chinese. 

Service was really good despite being a busy Saturday night. Our server was very nice and friendly. Checking in on us enough to make sure we never lacked anything but left us alone enough to enjoy our food.

Parking available on the street, however you may have to drive around a bit to find one. Not a fan of driving around like me? There is a very close parking structure within walking distance of the restaurant. Parking on a Saturday night was $5. Parking lot does close at 10pm so make sure you come back by then to prevent having your car locked up overnight.

Would I go back? Absolutely! Especially to try more food and their tasting looking drinks from the bar!"

It looked like everyone was trying their best. Our waitress was nice and the food was ok. Our bill came out to around $55 for two people, which is not unreasonable. Except I was still hungry.

You know who also works hard for a buck, me! So when I spend $55 for dinner the last thing I want to feel is hungry. I asked for the whole chicken plate they had on the menu but they ran out of THAT chicken. I was referred to try ANOTHER chicken dish which ended up being a fried leg and a small breast piece. There was some pickled cabbage, basil on the side, and a plain hard boiled egg. That&#39;s it. 

I didn&#39;t know it was just those two pieces. Why would I go from whole chicken to less than half of a chicken? My dish was $12, the whole chicken was $15. So for 3 more dollars I could have saved my $55 dinner. I still tipped the waitress liked nothing happened, but I was pretty annoyed. 

I&#39;m not saying don&#39;t go here, but I definitely won&#39;t return."

The space is large with two stories.  Since there were so many of us we decided to order in smaller groupings and our server was happy to oblige.

We decided on a variety of drinking food items, grilled things, one plate meals and shared meals.  The food was decent.  I chose the KHANOM JIIN NAAM YAA, a one plate meal of coconut curry with ground fish and krachai, served over thin rice vermicelli with pickled mustard greens, bean sprouts, lemon basil and boiled egg.  I sampled a few other items.  Our favorite were the signature IKE&#39;S VIETNAMESE FISH SAUCE WINGS.  But at nearly $16 for half a dozen wings, it was pricey!  Everything is here.

The cocktails are priced at a more standard $12 and were the most memorable part.  I loved my MANGO ALEXANDER, made with mango, gin instead of vodka, coconut cream and lime.  I would return for that."

But I actually kind of like it, since it doesn&#39;t involve any heavy breathing, creepy messages, stolen underwear, or a Vermont Teddy Bear being left on my doorstep this time. That&#39;s because I&#39;m not being stalked by a person, I&#39;m being stalked by a place, and that place is Portland!

First came Stumptown Coffee (2013), Salt &amp; Straw was next (2014), then Blue Star Donuts (2015), and now Pok Pok is the latest to join the invasion. I only lived in Portland for 2 years (have I ever mentioned this in a review before???) but these businesses all conveniently happened to open up here AFTER I moved back to CA. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s just a coincidence. Stalkers.

Pok Pok LA is in Chinatown&#39;s Mandarin Plaza, just past Central Plaza. I found free parking in the same spot my parents used to park when they took us to Chinatown when we were kids. There was already a line out the door when we arrived at opening on a Saturday, but fortunately we had reservations. While there are two bars, an upstairs level, and outdoor patio, the restaurant is not intended to be elegant, as reflected in the seemingly cheap tablecloth that covered our wobbly table. The colorful lights were kinda cool though.

I recommend getting chicken, and more chicken:
IKE&#39;S VIETNAMESE FISH SAUCE WINGS: their signature dish. Get it spicy. If your friends don&#39;t want it spicy, then don&#39;t share, get your own, or find new friends, because it&#39;s 3x better hot! They&#39;re deep fried, tossed in caramelized fish sauce and garlic, and are accompanied by much needed moist towelettes.
KAI YAANG (Roasted Mary&#39;s Natural Chicken): as noted on the menu, this dish was the original inspiration for Pok Pok. The chicken is considerably more meaty than the wings, it&#39;s juicy, well seasoned, and can be further enhanced by the 2 dipping sauces it comes with.

Other notables range from pork belly and shoulder to fried fish. No matter what you get, add something like coconut or sticky rice, or a papaya salad to balance things out and mix it all up.

Note to my stalker: you can send Tasty n Alder/Sons or Pine State Biscuits after me next  :)"

When we walked in we were greeted right away and had to wait to be seated. They were quick to seat us and right away our server  was there. We started with the fish sauce wings they are quite spendy 15$ for 6 wings but they were delicious we also had another dish I can&#39;t remember what it was called but it was pork belly and it was like a stew. It was super I then ordered an iced coffee after dinner which was very good. The service was great and the food was also good I can see how some reviews say it&#39;s salty but I love salt so for me it was perfect! We will go back before leaving the area

The food is excellent. The food is Asian. The owner is white. The food is pricey.
Almost everything averages about $15 from main courses to appetitzers to cocktails. 

So if you have two cocktails, an appetizer and a main dish, expect to spend $60 plus tax and tip, for about $70.

Pok Pok LA sits on the northern edge of Chinatown, practically falling off the cliff where North Broadway meets the train tracks and the new park many feet below. It occupies a 1970s mall with many empty shops and some crappy stores.

You enter the restaurant from the back, and step into a turquoise space, decorated with flowered plastic tablecloths. A reservations desk is in front, and that&#39;s where you first go, assuming you have a reservation. We did not, but promised to be out of our seats within an hour.

We were seated by a friendly man, who also worked as our waiter and then skipped over to the well stocked bar to pour drinks for patrons there.  He returned, to recommended to we first timers some excellent choices.

He brought a pitcher of cold water flavored with pandan leaf. Delicious and refreshing. 

We started with Thua Thawt Samun Phrai
1/4 lb house deep fried red peanuts with dry chilies, lime leaf, garlic and sea salt. Spicy and appetite inducing, served in a little bowl.  ($5)

Then we had the most delicious thing on the menu, possibly one of the most wonderful things I have ever had, Ike&#39;s Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings ($15.50) fried in garlic and served with Vietnamese salad. This alone would be a reason to come back here. They are messy and scrumptious. And they give you many napkins and wet wipes to clean yourself up with.

Kaeng Hang Leh, ($16) is Northern Thai sweet pork belly and pork shoulder curry with ginger, palm sugar, tumeric and tamarind. It was excellent, and perfect with jasmine rice. 

Next we had a bowl of vegetables with fried something and many green vegetables and herbs. It was good but I have no idea what it was called and there wasn&#39;t much of it, and it cost about $12.

Overall, we were guided by the excellent suggestions of the waiter, who kept us out of ordering too much and gave us a balanced and well selected group of pork, chicken and vegetables.

Would I come back here? Yes absolutely.

But only if someone wealthier than me were paying for the meal or if I suddenly got a very lucrative job and could drop money on normally affordable Asian food."

The flavors are bold but nothing to write home about. Maybe the staff oversold it but the chicken wings were just ok.

INTERIOR/ EXTERIOR
Dining inside at night feels almost magical because of the dim lighting. Many tables available and they have a bar.

MENU
I somehow just miss out on trying this place every single time I am in Portland. So when I finally got the chance to try Pok Pok in LA, it was exciting! However, that was quickly followed by disappointment at how small the portions were for the price we were paying.

We ordered a total of four dishes including the Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings ($15) which were only available spicy, Kaeng Hang Leh ($15.50) which was Burmese curry with pork belly pieces, Papaya Pok Pok ($9), and another set of fried chicken wings. Despite being spicy, the chicken wings were good and not too hot. We ordered a side of rice for the curry, which just might be my favorite but the portions were disappointingly small. The papaya salad was barely touched on my part because it was spicy to the point it burns. We also ordered three drinks ($12 each) to go with our meal. Check came out to be about $100.

SERVICE
No wait upon arriving, which was nice. A server dropped by often to refill our coconut infused water especially after our papaya salad dilemma and also told us that for future reference, we can order the papaya salad mild spicy. 

In my opinion, food is not worth it for the price and the drive. Can&#39;t say I&#39;ll be back but it&#39;ll probably take a lot of convincing."

Ike&#39;s Vietnamese fish sauce wings are every bit as delicious as they&#39;ve been said to be, definitely the can&#39;t-miss item of the menu.  My friend and I split a few other dishes that were remarkable as well - the Kaeng Hang Leh was sweet and spicy and savory and a bunch of other adjectives that don&#39;t even begin to describe it, and the Chicken Khao Soi was also insanely good.  The drinks are great, the tamarind whiskey sour is a perfect way to ready your palate for what&#39;s to come.  I&#39;d highly recommend the affogato for dessert as well, it&#39;ll send you on your way very nicely.   

More than anything I just hope that Pok Pok survives the hiccups that it&#39;s had to endure since opening...people can be fickle, and this is an important addition to LA&#39;s culinary landscape.  Cheers."

First things first, if you&#39;re trying to make your way here, make sure you are going to Pok Pok LA and not Pok Pok Phat Thai.  My uber driver dropped me off at Pok Pok Phat Thai not realizing my mistake.  For your reference, Pok Pok LA is about 0.4 miles north up Broadway.

There&#39;s outdoor and indoor seating.  There&#39;s also an upstairs as well. Overhearing the bartender talk, you can bring your own bottle of wine but there&#39;s a $10 corkage fee.  

I was on a mission on a Tuesday. I wanted to just try their infamous wings.  I seated myself at the bar ordered Ike&#39;s Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings [spicy] and a Tito&#39;s vodka and soda.  Their bar has a vast selection of various liquors and at a reasonable prices [$8-$9].  On this given night, they were out of their Thai Mekhong Whiskey, which I wanted to try.  I&#39;ll have to make my way back.

The wings came out within 10 minutes.  They come with pickled veggies and cucumbers.  The portion was of decent size.  I think in all you get about 5-6 wings. Just for your reference, a wing includes the drumette, wingette and tip.  The wings were deliciously flavored with fish sauce and chili flakes.  They were very crispy and not spicy at all.  If you&#39;re not down with fish sauce, then I don&#39;t know what to say, you&#39;re simply missing out.  Additionally, the dish itself was $15.  I personally rank these wings in my top 5 wings I&#39;ve had.  They&#39;re that good.

Overall the vibe of Pok Pok LA is cool.  I love that there&#39;s a full bar and look forward to trying some of their other dishes along with the Ike&#39;s wings again and again."

Location: in the middle of Chinatown. Plenty of street parking and parking structures around. 

Service: excellent! Our server and other servers were very attentive and helpful!

Food:
Fish sauce wings: not what I remembered eating in Portland. I was in love at first bite- not so much here. It wasn&#39;t as crispy and too salty yet sweet. Tasted like BBQ wings- yes that! The pickles in the side was on point though. 
Khao soi: again it wasn&#39;t what I was expecting. The chicken was tender but so was the noodle- a little soggy. 
Fish ball curry with vermecille: pretty spicy, so beware!! It was too heavy in coconut milk for my taste.
Spicy beef flank salad: also spicy but tasty although I don&#39;t think the dish stood out either. 
Sticky rice: super dry
Corn on the Cobb with coconut cream and lime: amazing! I love corn! The combination of corn and coconut cream was just perfection!
Jackfruit coconut ice cream in buns: the bread was dry and the ice cream was not memorable.

The highlights were; spicy chicken wings not too hot (spicy), coconut rice, green papaya salad, (the salad was very spicy- could feel my lips burning so good!), and the prawn and pork belly dish with glass noodles, especially the dipping sauce. Also, the bergamot infused Bourbon drink-- just genius, so well balanced. 

The disappointing part of the dinner was the cuttlefish dish, i love cuttlefish but this dish looked like the bottom of a shoe and the texture was like jerky. We took one bite which was difficult then asked them to take it away it did not meet the description on the menu at all. At this point, I would have thought the waitress would have offered to replace it with something else -- but she didn&#39;t. We also came to find out there were specials that night, which we were not made aware of, we definitely would have ordered the whole fried fish :( The pok pok gin and tonic was not well balanced and my tamarind martini was poured short but at least it was tasty. 

The pricing is high side for Thai food, but the portion sizes are appropriate. That said, I don&#39;t think we will be back."

1. What is Pok Pok?
Pok Pok is a Thai restaurant with origins in Portland, OR. The eatery was founded by Andy Ricker, who traveled to Thailand multiple times to learn the proper way of cooking Thai food.

2. What is the ambience like? 
I was startled at how casual the eatery feels, particularly when accounting for the relatively high menu prices. Pok Pok is a no frills restaurant, but it is actually quite fitting for a home-y Asian eatery. 

3. What should you order?
The wings. Hands down. Make sure to get it spicy for that added kick. 

According to our waiter, there is a large dispersion among the entrees that are widely ordered, and there is no &#34;most popular&#34; dish. We ultimately ordered the khao soi with chicken. This was our first time trying this dish, so while we have no appropriate benchmark, we really enjoyed our noodles. 

We&#39;ll surely be back in LA for those wings. After all, what&#39;s a 1 hr drive from OC compared to a plane right to Portland?"

I&#39;m Thai and I can&#39;t stand it!

Food is a solid 8 1/2. I had to go with my favorite, Hoi tod (mussels pancake), but unfortunately , it was wayyyy to salty! 

Yum samun prai was a big hit as well as duck larb. If you mix the two dishes together, you might be able to take the heat from the larb cuz it was fierce!

Lastly, I love their pandan infused water. So refreshing and fragrant."

So if you are ready for some spicy authentic food, this is the place to be. It was double-date night, so I came here with my boyfriend and his couple friends for DineLA. The place was crowded and happening so luckily we had reservation and was seated immediately. 

Decor/Cleanliness  
The decor reminded me of the bar scene in Thailand. Except here there wasn&#39;t a karaoke  stage for singers to perform and no open space to see the street. However, the decor was appropriate because it did make you feel like you have a piece of Thailand here in the States. The place was very clean, even the bathrooms were well kept. 

Food
F&#39;ing spicy. So for the DineLA menu, I ordered the Neua Khwai Sawan (glazed-spicy beef jerky), Khao Soi (mildly spicy coconut curry chicken egg noodle soup), and Papaya pok pok (f&#39;ing spicy papaya salad). My boyfriend got the Laap Thawt Isaan (lemon pork patties), Yam Khai Dao (f&#39;ing spicy egg spicy), and Cha ca &#34;La Vong&#34; (this is a Vietnamese dish which they tell you in the menu, not so spicy catfish with rice vermicelli noodles). All the food was  authentic and good. I wished that I could finished my papaya salad but the spiciness was just too much for me to handle. However the the Cha ca was delicious and the Khao Soi was good as well, I definitely recommend those 2 dishes. 

Service
Was good, however extremely slow. I think it was because of DineLA or they were just under staff that night.

Overall Experience 
4 Stars, it should be 3 Stars however... the food spoke for itself. I definitely recommend coming here for the food because it&#39;s so authentic. But beware the food is F&#39;ing spicy!

I was a little shocked at the small volume of noodles.  And really,  at $16 it&#39;s not street food anymore, and hasn&#39;t been for awhile.  So at this price, I don&#39;t want to have to deal with trying to eat a whole chicken leg and thigh,  which were both raw near the bone.  
The flavors were good, but the menu is just overpriced.  It&#39;s not like I&#39;m in Wyoming where it might be harder to find a Thai restaurant. It&#39;s not even like I&#39;m in Portland.  The only thing it has going for me is that the location is convenient.  I might stop back once in a long while, but only because of convenience.
Oh yeah, they add a 5% service charge.  At $16 for a small bowl of noodles, maybe they can pay the staff more, and not annoyingly stick it to the customers.   So I&#39;m supposed to add 20% on top of that?"

Pok Pok won me over with that first sip of their leaf infused water that tastes like coconut water and the first slurp of Khao Soi (chicken curry noodles). Just thinking about those noodles and that refreshing water has me craving more! 

Prices are a bit steep for Thai food, but everything was delicious and given the stamp of authentic approval from the best Thai chef I know.

The Pok Pok Special (half chicken and papaya salad combo) was good, but I plan to order the wings next visit.  

For dessert we shared the Khanom Pang Ai Tiim, a fudge drizzled ice cream with rice tucked inside of a sweet bun that would make any sweet tooth happy. I found it a bit too sweet for my savory inclined tastebuds but still very reminiscent of the street food in Thailand.

Free parking is conveniently located on the premises."

It&#39;s the kind of place that pays homage to the type of thai food beyond your pad-thai and green curry.  It&#39;s the kind of place you&#39;ll wan to go check out if you want to learn more about Thai cuisine without actually hopping on a plane.  It&#39;s the kind of place you&#39;ll want to go if you also want to enjoy a very nice cocktail with your Thai food too.

The menu can be a bit daunting and overwhelming; but it definitely leaves room to explore.  I&#39;ve been back 3 times and I have yet to have the same dish, or been able to get through half of what I&#39;m curious to try.  But with that said, I will say that everything has been enjoyable.  It&#39;s easy to notice the pointed intentions of each dish, and the detail that went into it.  The notions of Thai food and their balance of sweet, spice, savory and sour are present and distinct.  It&#39;s not mushed together, but phased out well like a good whiskey or fine wine. 

It&#39;s easy to start making comparisons to tons of other places in Thai town; but that&#39;s not a fair comparison.  It&#39;s the kind of place where you can see the effort being to put in to recreate dishes local to the various regions of Thailand. You don&#39;t get a sense of any shortcuts taken here.  I know that as good as my mom&#39;s cooking is, she does use some shortcuts sometime and you also wonder how much better it would even be without those.  It&#39;s kind of like that.  And as a nice bonus, you do get a sense of story of each of those dishes presented here; what region, what the chef appreciates about it, why it&#39;s interesting. I find that incredibly valuable serves as a really nice catalyst to go and hunt out something you might enjoy a lot.  

I will note that I am a little bit disappointed by how the rice is portioned out.  I don&#39;t have a problem with the pricing of the rest of the menu, but charging $2-3 for each tiny portion of rice  seems a little bit like nickel and diming.  At an establishment like this, I would like to see it such that it&#39;s a fuller portion; or just fold the cost of that into the price of the other entrees.  However, as it stands right now, it&#39;s almost akin to French or Italian restaurant charging bread by the slice or mini bun worth; maybe worse because it&#39;s such a common accompaniment in Asian cuisine.  

On a non-food front, the space surprisingly big.  In addition to the main floor, there&#39;s an expansive 2nd floor and outdoor seating as well.  Also, I will say that the service is outstanding here.  The waitstaff were knowledgeable about the items on the menu, attentive to your needs, and quick to offer refills should your cocktail run low. FInally, parking should not be an issue as Pok Pok is located on the northern end of Chinatown where the action is much less happening than the mid area.

Footnote: The $20 restaurant credit reservation system and 5% service charge is no longer in place and does not apply.  That was a minor gripe of mine during my experience, but happy to see it&#39;s gone!"

I&#39;ve been to the Pok Pok in Portland twice and loved it both times. Was really excited about the location in Chinatown finally being open! Made reservations for me and the bf on a Saturday night through Tok (NOTE: The Tok system charges $20 per person for dinner, but that amunt is put towards your dinner bill, so it&#39;s like pre-paying for dinner)

FOOD:
- fish sauce wings (spicy) - I prefer the spicy ones because I think they are so yummy! And not spicy at all! Very flavorful, definitely brought me back to Portland. Flavor was great, chicken was a tiny bit on the dry side.
- kaeng hang leh (pork belly and shoulder curry) - this is sooo good and flavorful!! I wouldn&#39;t really call this a curry, more like braised pork belly and shoulder that&#39;s super tender and delicious.
- khao soi with chicken - I&#39;ve had khao soi before and wasn&#39;t too impressed with it, but I enjoyed Pok Pok&#39;s. Less brothy, more noodles in a thick sauce. Throw all the add-ins into the bowl! (pickled mustard greens, onions, chili) and add fish sauce to taste - makes the dish much more yummy!

SERVICE:
Friendly and fast. There are a lot of servers and workers about, and some have walkie talkies on them since the place is two stories.

VENUE/PARKING:
The place is huge!! Two stories with an outdoor patio, you can see that it used to be a chinese restaurant since some of the original decorations were left as is. AC was BLASTING when we went, so pack a sweater! They advertise a parking lot 100 feet past the restaurant, but we found a (free) meter spot right outside. Place was busy, but not packed, plenty of empty tables near us.

Would definitely come back, but not super regularly. Prices are a touch high ($15-16 a plate, average) to come back often. They do take walk-ins! Very happy that it&#39;s open in LA and hoping it revitalizes that (rather empty) plaza in Chinatown :D"

Chinatown still fairly slow at night so you kind of walk up to this place expecting nothing, yet through the outdoor courtyard awaits a comfortable vibe and a tasty time.

The menu here is deeeep, but the right kind of depth with a  number interesting dishes many of which you haven&#39;t seen on traditional Thai menu.  Its &#34;drinking food&#39; / street food inspired, from the chef&#39;s travels.

1) Naem Sii Khrong Muu Thawt / Sour Pork Riblets - These arent&#39; the famous fish sauce wings, but these were some of the tastiest I&#39;ve had.  Sour &amp; flavorful vs.overly sauced/sugared like many.  Loved it.
2)  Half roasted chicken - This reminded me of A-Frame&#39;s beer can chicken, only the skin was incredible...like a Peking duck.  This is the best chicken skin I&#39;ve ever had, and let&#39;s just say I&#39;ve put some birds down in my day.
3) Cha Ca &#34;La Vong&#34;/ Tumeric Catfish - This was very good, and lightly wok fried fish.  I&#39;m not a huge fan of catfish, and think another whitefish would help take it even further, but would still recommend.
4) Da Chom&#39;s Laap Meuang / Minced Pork Salad - Good, but I&#39;d try something more adventurous.

Cocktail menu is fantastic and I can&#39;t remember which but both were good and showed craftmanship.   I am making myself a cocktail now, inspired by this review....slurp.

Only thing I wouldn&#39;t recommend is the Thai &#39;Jelly&#39; Beer which is a big barrel with salt and ice that tumbles the beer and transports a perfectly good Singha to a 1990s white trash beer....it tasted like flat MGD...I flashed back to high school."

My friend asked if I wanted to go Pok Pok. Excuse me? What do you want to do to me?
Take me to dinner first! Oh wait, what?! It&#39;s a Thai restaurant? Oh okay. Pok Pok now, Pok, Pok LA-ter....

When we walked in the first thing I noticed was the &#34;no guns&#34; sign at the entrance. The sign alone made me feel safe.  

The lighting decor moved toward the dark side with some blue vibes. A very stylized environment that reflects its unique flavor. The yellow / orange menu contrasted the blue lighting in a way that made the menus stand out. While the colors popped, the menu&#39;s typography needed some breathing room. My eyes strained to read it... but we prevailed. Mainly because the awesome waitress washed away our indecisiveness.  

The following dishes became our new taste buds... taste friends???

Peanuts - Nice appetizer. Set the mood because things were about to get nuts!!!

Ike&#39;s Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings - So much kick!!! Not your Teep-ical wings. I almost front kicked my friend over last piece. Lucky for him... I&#39;m an eater, not a fighter. 

Kaeng Hang Leh - Saucy Fork Tender Goodness. Oh the gravy... baby... This is what we train for.

Kung Op Wun Sen - reminded me of pancit. The dipping sauce...oh... the dipping sauce. Just dip it. Dip it good. 

Coconut Rice - One order was Enough for two. Smells nice. 

Jasmine Rice - We barely touched it. The order of Coconut rice filled us up... Also smells nice.

Water - Moist and goes down smooth.

Iced Vietnamese Coffee with Stumptown. Not as Chicory as regular iced coffee. But kept us up to keep the Pok Pok going... whatever that means.

In hindsight. The &#34;no guns&#34; sign is a bit Ironic... because we had a blast!!! Blown away even!!!

Is that a weird Portland thing?

We ate at Pok Pok in Portland 4 years ago and it was amazing. We love the noodles place. We have some friends that we introduced to Night Market, and were super excited to bring them here. But I ended up being sort of embarrassed. 

Don&#39;t get me wrong, the food is good. Honestly, what we had was different than Night Market, and some things were more interesting, but the execution wasn&#39;t good. Everything was sort of room temperature and the same textures, which fly in the face of good northern Thai food. 

The other thing going really well here is the drinks. Creative and really well done. 

Here are my two problems (aside from execution of food mentioned above):
1. Too pricey. Portions are way too small for what they charge. 

2. Service was terrible. We ordered food and drinks together. When my buddy was ready to order his second drink, the waiter came back and told us he couldn&#39;t find our food order, so he hadn&#39;t placed it yet. Something else got messed up, so we had our lone appetizer 45 minutes after we sat down, and the rest of our meal a full hour and 15 after we sat down. But one dish didn&#39;t make it even then, so we asked about it and eventually got it. They took that one off the bill, but the wait was still terrible. 

Given Andy Ricker&#39;s obsessive personality, real talent, and proven success, I was surprised by our experience. For now, Night Market is where you need to go, at least while they figure out what&#39;s going wrong here."

The bar area is great and most of the items were pretty good form. The chicken wings are a must and I also got the pad woon sen, tasty and had oysters in it too!

The dessert was a little disappointing with the sticky rice being a little soggy in the runny sauce. Most of the time it has a little more viscosity and the rice is more plump.

The pandan water was a refreshing with a hint of coconuts. Overall if I was looking for a place to spend a little more on Thai food I would come, but it&#39;s a little more than what I expected for a more &#34;relaxed&#34; experience and the type of food you are getting."

The food itself wasn&#39;t bad, but the 1 star is because of the service we received. Our waitress was nice enough, but the wait was just too long. From the moment we sat down to the moment we left was about 1hr 20min for lunch at 2pm on a Tuesday. During the meal, none of our food was served hot, maybe lukewarm at best. We had ordered a mango sticky rice for dessert, and I watched the waitress bring one to another table that gotten there and ordered way after us, then tell me they were all out, which didn&#39;t make sense at all. Instead, they gave me an ice cream sandwich, but both mine and my brother&#39;s were half the size of the original dessert. I know this because a man sitting next to us had ordered the same thing off the restaurant week menu. I left feeling cheated and rushed to get back to work. 

Overall, I wouldn&#39;t return. The food is fine but it&#39;s way too expensive, even for restaurant week.

After reading the &#34;yes it&#39;s hipster but the food is really special so try it anyway&#34; food critics, we went for it despite the so-so Yelp reviews. The crowd appears to be correct:

Chicken Wings - Solid, but I can think of at least a few other wings I like equally or more. 

Boar collar - my favorite, even though the dire warnings of how hot it was along with the side of shaved ice were not necessary. If everything were as good as the boar collar, I&#39;d say Pok Pok would be 4 stars.

Cha ca Vietnamese-style catfish - not even in the league of the amazing catfish available in and around Bolsa in Orange County, or at Fish Dish for that matter.

Eggplant and papaya salads - despite the flowery descriptions, both plain.

Mushroom salad - okay, although we ordered two of these and one tasted fairly different than the other. 

When our food came out, the portions were small and we were sure we would order more, but after trying everything, our party of 6 was more content to eat light. I find it common at even my favorite Thai restaurants that there are a couple great dishes they&#39;re known for and others that are in the middle that you live with, so maybe that&#39;s why I feel so disappointed that a restaurant claiming to present the definitive take on all of these dishes couldn&#39;t manage to get me there with even one, the boar coming closest. 

Our server was really friendly and we all had a really nice evening catching up, so it&#39;s a bummer the food didn&#39;t meet our expectations."

I recently went to Thailand and came home.  A few weeks later, I started to crave Thai food. I know this place just opened up and they have a great location in Portland too.  It is located in a strip mall in Chinatown in Los Angeles.  You walk into the location and it appears to be kind of cheap.  Cheap looking table clothes and chairs.  It really did feel like I was back in Thailand experiencing it all over again.  Eating in a third world country.  It was pretty authentic looking.  Then we ordered the food and overall it was a good representation of what Thai food is like.  If you like Thai food, you will for sure love Pok Pok.  

Here is what we ordered: 

- Laap Thawt Isaan - This is a spicy pork patty.  The flavor of this dish represents the exact taste of Thai cooking.  Very good

- Sai Ua Samun Phra - This was a Chaing Mai sausage with a Naam Phrik Num dipping sauce.  The sausage was great and the Naam Phirik Num could be a little spicier.  

- Chicken Khao Soi - I was really looking forward to this dish as I had this a few times in Thailand.  It was pretty good.  Overall it is a little sweeter than what you get in Thailand and if anything I would say that took this dish down a notch for me.  

- Papaya Pok Pok - This dish is just okay.  I would pass on this one.  There are probably other alternatives you can eat that are better. 

Overall everything was good and pretty authentic.  I was surprised to see no mango sticky rice on the desert menu.  I am sure it hard to match as the mangoes in Thailand are a lot better.  I will go to this place in the future to try other menu items.  Overall a good experience."

The portions are very small. The service was pretty bad, we sat down (with reservations) at 7:20 and ordered right away but didn&#39;t get our food until 8:40. 

Instead of just apologizing for the mistake, they said it&#39;s what they normally do, they put in your one appetizer and then put in your meal an hour later, I&#39;m not so sure about that one. They did comp one meal item that server forgot to put in. So I give them that, but still frustrating because the server forgot to put it in..apologizing for the mistake and offering dessert would have been a better move, but hey, no place is perfect.

All that said, it is good food. I would give the food 4 stars if it weren&#39;t for the experience and portion size. It also really feels like you are in Thailand inside, great ambiance."

Yet, despite its location in Mandarin Plaza in Chinatown, Pok Pok LA serves traditional Thai food in a welcoming, homey atmosphere.  As the latest iteration of Andy Ricker&#39;s acclaimed Portland eatery, Pok Pok LA has the potential to be a game-changer, but several improvements need to be considered.

Although there were plentiful options on the regular menu, I opted to order from the DineLA menu since that afforded the opportunity of trying more things at a more reasonable price ($15 for two small plates).  Sadly, many of the items for which Pok Pok is known, like the chicken wings, were not available on the DineLA menu, but I was able to find several things that caught my eye and, ultimately, appealed to my stomach.  I had the opportunity to try the following items:

NEUA KHWAI SAWAN ($8.25)
Described as &#34;Issan-Thai style jerky,&#34; this dish consists of fried, marinated dried buffalo with fried lime leaves and a spicy dipping sauce.  Although this wasn&#39;t as flavorful as I would have liked, it will certainly appeal to fans of jerky.

LAAP THAWT ISSAN ($9)
What&#39;s not to like about this dish?  It&#39;s basically deep fried ground pork seasoned with lime and herbs.  Part of what made this dish so delicious was the intensity and complexity of the flavor. The only drawback would be the size: you only get three small pieces!

KHAO SOI WITH CHICKEN ($16.25)
Khao soi combines many of my favorite aspects of Thai food: noodles, curry, and coconut milk.  Of the ingredients, the chicken was probably the best part, as it was fall-off-the-bone tender.  (Yes, there are bones, as they use chicken legs.)  Otherwise, there was a decent mix of crispy and soft noodles.  The curry was, as advertised mild, allowing you to taste the richness of the coconut milk.  Overall, this was solid, but probably not worth the full price.

Though I enjoyed my meal, I had two issues with Pok Pok: cost and service.  Since I doubt the restaurant will be changing their prices anytime soon, I would warn potential customers that Pok Pok isn&#39;t cheap.  Although most items are meant to be shared, portion are on the smaller side.  And, most dishes are between $10-20.  Does the food warrant the higher cost?  That&#39;s debatable.  

Service, however, is something that can be improved. I had previously attempted to come to Pok Pok on a weekend for lunch.  My friend and I arrived shortly after the restaurant opened and asked if they had a table for 2.  We assumed they would since the restaurant looked half empty.  The hostess simply asked if we had a reservation, and upon hearing that we did not, said &#34;sorry,&#34;  ushered us out of the restaurant, and quickly closed the door behind us.  To add injury to insult, the restaurant advertises on its website that it has over 200 seats that can easily accommodate walk-ins and reservations.  Talk about false advertisement.  I had also asked a question about the use of peanuts in the dishes we had ordered, but never received an answer even though the waitress assured me she would check with the kitchen to verify.  Her lack of response made me assume that everything was all right, but had she been wrong, this could have been a disastrous meal.

As Pok Pok becomes more established, I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll iron out any wrinkles in their operations, but for the time being, I would hesitate to recommend checking out Pok Pok, especially if you&#39;re on a budget. 4 stars for food; 3 stars for service/cost."

We ordered chicken skewers for the appetizer and were so in love with the peanut sauce we ate it by the spoonful! Our main dish was a pork curry with coconut rice that we shared - little chunks of fatty porky heaven, garlicky sauce, and sumptuous taste... Guh, I could bathe in this... We also ordered a papaya salad - which was pretty delicious and spicy.

For dessert, we tackled the durian custard and the jackfruit ice cream on the sweet roll. I went in on the durian custard - that was fire! Not everyone&#39;s taste, but no problem - it was lovely and I would eat that again. The ice cream on the sweet bun was amazing - loved the texture of the ice cream. More on the icy side, but was nice!

We topped it all off with the adult Vietnamese coffee and a singha. 

Overall, loved the service and attentiveness. I took a star off because the menu was pretty overwhelming to get though - lots of long descriptions as opposed to concise details - I thought that this slowed down the ordering process. Our waitress was super patient and explained everything, which was nice. Also, this spot is rather pricey considering the portions/location ($83! Put it on the credit card) but I imagine they have to make rent in Chinatown. Still, could only realistically come here once in a while, which may keep some clientele away. I love a good quality dining experience but I don&#39;t think the prices were necessarily fair for what we got."

Parking: street or lot ($5 with validation?) 

Spicy Wings for $15 - 6 wings, spicy is the way to go, it&#39;s not too spicy, but still pretty good! 

Hang Leh $16 pretty good dish! 

Khao Soi Chix $16.25 was a noodle dish which we addeded in chicken was my favorite, there was also something crispy inside the noodles.   

Papaya Salad $9.75 was really SPICY.  We could barely finish it b/c my mouth was burning so much 

Rice - coconut $3.50 or Rice - sticky $3 are both good choices 

Sangkhaya thurian - was a dessert with a mild taste of durian $8 which was pretty good.  The rice does taste like the rice from mango sticky rice."

The Los Angeles Times, more particularly Jonathan Gold wield a lot of power in this city. This fact became very evident to me tonight. Pok Pok LA was packed; on a Sunday night at 9:00 it was wall to wall here. We came tonight for the mere reason that this place was getting &#34;Press&#34;, and very good &#34;Press&#34; at that.

After experiencing Pok Pok LA of Portland, Oregon fame, I don&#39;t get it?

From our cranky bartender cawing like a crow at us as we waited for our table to be ready (this guy did not want to be here tonight) , to the same bartender mixing us a $12.00 three sip watered down drink that had about as much punch as a 72 year old Rocky Balboa; this night was just getting started.

We were seated by a very pleasant young lady whom was quite helpful and honest in her appraisal of how long our &#34;no reservation&#34; party would have to wait. She was as congenial as our bartender wasn&#39;t. 

The menu looked exciting and we were ready to jump into it:

The Ike&#39;s Spicy Wings were great! If I ever came back here (which is questionable) it would be for this and a beer, only.

The Khoa Man Som Tan Salad tasted like mud, not that I&#39;ve ever eaten mud before, but if I had, I would imagine it tasted like this. We refused to eat it and sent it back and requested another selection**. We got our second crow cawing of the night. Nice!

The Kung Op Shrimp was OK. We ordered it spicy but came ever so not, served very temperature hot (though) it took 20 minutes to cool down; at this point in the evening we were hungry and didn&#39;t feel like the wait, but we kept tossing and stirring this dish trying to speed up the cooling process.

The Chicken Khao Soi again was OK but just missed the mark which shouldn&#39;t be happening at these prices.

Listen, I&#39;m not a cheap bast**d. My last Thai food dinner was 4 weeks ago at Uncle Boons in New York City which was twice as much as Pok Pok, but worth every penny and I&#39;d go back tomorrow.  

There was no value or bang for your buck here. Our North Hollywood dive Thai restaurant is 70% less expensive,  70% more delicious and 70% more accommodating than Pok Pok Restaurant. That&#39;s 210% better if you use my math. Our go to Hole In The Wall is a steal compared to tonight&#39;s experience. 

Oh, BTW, our muddy salad** we sent back and ordered a replacement, was left on our bill and we got or third crow cawing of the night when I demanded it&#39;s removal. 

Geez, I felt like I was in a cornfield in Iowa from all of the crow cawing I got this evening.

I like Jonathan Gold! 
His writing flows. It&#39;s smart. He hits so many important points in not to many words. This is an art and a craft I really admire. I will continue to read him and value his opinion, but I missed here tonight what he saw, tasted and experienced? His review of Pok Pok LA was certainly a far cry from mine?

There are a lot of excuses I can give to Pok Pok LA for this not so good dining experience, and would, if I didn&#39;t have to pay $100.00 for what I hope was just an off night for them."

The full restaurant experience is a different matter.  Billed as higher end Thai food.  I came with some friends for dineLA 2016.  They pretty much ordered off the menu and I got the dineLA set.

The decor is kitschy.  The have the plastic table cloths and neon colored Christmas lights.  It&#39;s supposed to remind of Southeast Asia I think.  The plastic tablecloths definitely does that for me.

Expect everything spicy if it&#39;s marked spicy.  I should&#39;ve gotten a Thai Iced tea to dilute some of the spice in my mouth.  I remember the Papaya salad (sour and spicy), the fish sauce chicken wings (too fishy for me) and that&#39;s about it.  Everything tasted sour and spicy to me.  Maybe I ordered incorrectly but the menus itself is a test in concentration and there are a lot of new things even for me.

Would I go back?  Maybe if someone who knew what to order.  Everything seemed off balance in the flavors.  I&#39;ll go if they orderd something more than sour and spicy."

I ignore the price equation when writing reviews and focus on the uniqueness and quality of the experience and food drive my rating.

For this reason, although it&#39;s an import from Portland, vs. a home grown LA restaurant I rate Pok Pok LA as a 4 star place.  They have an excellent and broad set of whiskeys to choose from in addition to their Som sipping vinegars.  We only ordered one dish... one of our favorite dishes from the Northern Thai city of Chiang Mai Khao Soi which is a coconut curry dish that is very different than the cuisine of central Thailand.  It was excellently prepared and much fresher than other Khao Soi&#39;s I&#39;ve had.

The menu will excite you.  Definitely worth the trip to Chinatown."

Wings are fantastic and I really liked the eggplant salad. We had a pork curry that was delicious too. My salted plum collins was really good. I love salted plum and it delivered in terms of flavor. A lot of spice in dishes so be ready!

What really annoyed me about our meal was the service. A friend ordered a cocktail after me and it never came, so we just cancelled it. We even asked the waiter about it twice. He could only apologize and say that the bar was slammed. Really?? For 40 minutes to the point where the bar can&#39;t add one drink? And then to top it all off there it was on our bill. I had to flag him down to correct. It could have been an honest mistake, but these details really shouldn&#39;t be overlooked. And let&#39;s face it, it&#39;s the difference between a make it or break it kind of experience."

I first visited Pok Pok in Portland at the original location and was completely impressed by the flavor and spice of all the dishes. When I found it Andy Ricker was opening in LA, I was so excited, I booked a table for their soft opening. Since then, I&#39;ve been back recently and I&#39;m still a huge fan. Here are some must-orders:

- Fish Sauce Wings - sticky, sweet and a hint of spice
- Fried Fish (Sea Bass for us; it&#39;s not on the menu, ask for it) - served with a sweet and sour sauce + a sour fish sauce
- Boar Collar - topped with garlic and spicy thai pepper 
- Papaya Pok Pok - spiced to perfection, get the special if you dare (it&#39;s a tasty stinky)
- Duck Larb - it&#39;s larb but on another level!

There&#39;s one thing that I love most, and it&#39;s free, the water! It&#39;s flavored with Pandan leaves giving the water a nice aroma to pair with everything spicy I ordered."

The wings are unbelievable and out of this world. I was less thrilled with some of their &#34;jerky&#34; appetizers; we tried their buffalo and cuttlefish varieties and did not really enjoy them. That said I&#39;m definitely going to return and try some of their other dishes (in their Brooklyn location I had a fish that was amazing).

Still, maybe the best possible situation is to line up a few batches of the wings with some cold beer and their spicy peanuts. Oh, those wings!!! That sounds like living to me! (Did I mention the wings?)"

I went here on a Monday night and was served upstairs with a surprisingly lively, albeit not full crowd, but for a newer restaurant of this caliber in LA, I wasn&#39;t too surprised. 

The flavors here are absolutely incredible, with the fish sauce wings and the pork belly stew being particularly incredible delights. The problem, as far as I see it, is portion size for the price. for a $20 stew, I&#39;d expect more than four small chunks of pork belly. I Understand if a stew of that amazing taste takes the time to deserve such a price tag, but I think I would have liked to have known going in how small everything was going to be. 

Besides the portion size issue, the drinks were amazing and everything I tasted was better than the next. Just expect to pay for a few dishes in order to get full!

Service wise, it was a little slow. Our servers couldn&#39;t have been nicer, but with all of the table side checking in, it couldn&#39;t have been more clear that all we were waiting on was our food.

But that DRINKING VINEGAR...DAMN! I&#39;ll be back for another one of those any day."

After a long day in LA, I insisted that we try this place since I have heard so much good stuff about the Oregon location. At 8:30pm on a Saturday, the wait time for 3 people was ~45mins for an inside table, or 15mins outside. You can make reservations online, but their system requires you to spend a certain amount/deposit of $20/person...you put that deposit down to make the reservation, and then it goes towards your food. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s refundable..

Located in Chinatown, which ironically lacks authentic Chinese food, this hipster Thai place sits in the heart of Chinatown. There&#39;s a parking structure next to it (Mandarin Plaza?) which is $5 for parking, but you get $2 back if you eat there and get validation. We went with the recommendations on here: 

- Pok Pok Fish Sauce Wings of course
- Pork belly + Shoulder Curry thing 
- Khao soi
- order of sticky rice + coconut rice

Fish sauce wings were EXTREMELY SALTY. I had to shovel copious amounts of rice in my mouth to offset it. As a Vietnamese gal, fish sauce runs in my blood, but even this...this was too much. It did have a crispy coating and juicy meat though. 

Pork belly + shoulder curry thing : didn&#39;t have a strong curry taste to me, reminiscent of this Vietnamese dish, braised pork and eggs (thit kho trung). The meat was tender and flavorful, but at $16+, I&#39;d rather make a whole pot of braised pork and eggs. 

Khao soi : my favorite item, chewy noodles, crispy wonton strips, savory, flavorful curry broth. The chicken was SO tender and soaked up the flavors of the mild curry. The contrasting textures of the chewy noodles, crispy wonton strips, and tender chicken made this our favorite dish of the night.

The sticky rice was okay, the coconut rice was better in my opinion. My gripe with these is that each bowl of rice was $2-$3. Whaaaaa? We paid $15+ for each dish, you&#39;d think rice would come with it... Our total came out to ~$60. Do you know how much food you could get with $60 at one of those mom and pop, authentic Thai restaurants?!? 

Service was great though, and if you ask for water, you get this yummy pandan-infused water (it&#39;s this green coconut-y leaf). Glad we tried it, but cannot bring myself to pay over $15/dish for small portions of Thai food again."

This is a cut above all those generic pad thai and tom yum restaurants and offers Thai cuisine that is more unique than Westerners are used to.  Warning:  A lot of the food here can get pretty spicy.  If you can&#39;t handle that, you should ask the waiter for more mild options.  

Parking:  It&#39;s in the part of Chinatown that actually has a lot of street parking.

Atmosphere:  I went on a Sunday night and was seated right away.  There&#39;s Christmas lights on the ceiling, which is an aesthetic trend that I&#39;m oddly a fan of.  Other than that, there isn&#39;t much that screams out that it&#39;s a Thai restaurant.

Service:  Perfect.  They&#39;re friendly, helpful, quick, never in your way.  Absolute ninjas.

Food:

Wings-  An absolute must.  I usually disdain eating with my hands, but I ended up with saucy fingers and even licked them clean.  

Boar collar-  They warned us that this is the spiciest dish they have, but I handled it.  They even give you a side of shaved ice just in case your mouth bursts into flames.  I thought it was great on its own, but definitely had a cumulative slow burn to it.  Like, the more you eat, the hotter it gets.

Duck Laap(?)-  I actually thought this dish was spicier than the boar.  Or, they were the same sauce and the spiciness just built on top of each other?  Either way, this one was really good too.

Chicken curry noodle-  A good way to neutralize all the spicy food and pad your stomach for the road home.

Careful if you want rice because that costs extra."

So my friend and I ordered their popular regular/non-spicy chicken wings (6pieces) and the Chicken Khao Soi (curry noodle soup). Honestly, the wings were a bit too salty for me, even though it did taste bold and delicious. The noodle (oh-gosh) was just perfect to my liking. I want to say those were egg noodles so it was more firm and chewy but not overly, and the chicken soaked up all the coconut flavor in the curry, so it has a mild sweetness to it. It&#39;s a must try!

The staffs are very kind and approachable, and the place has a full bar on the second floor. There are sinks conveniently located outside of the restroom for after handfood. Oh, don&#39;t confused this spot with Pok Pok Thai.

Great service and ambiance outside, but poor execution of food. 

Fish sauce wings -- friends said they were not as good as before, and the wings were barely warm when served.

Papaya salad dinner was decent. Small portions, but understand that they use the highest quality ingredients. Spice level was mild even we asked for the spicy version. I don&#39;t think Pok Pok has figured out what LA diners want in terms of flavor/spice."

The taste is very authentic and they flavor is outstanding. I&#39;ve ordered a lot of items here but my all time favorite is their chicken wings (of course) and the deep fried barramundi (on the chalk board and not on the menu). I would say that their wings is on my top 3 and I&#39;ve definitely eaten plenty of chicken wings in my lifetime. I would definitely recommend on getting at least an order of the wings. The barramundi is deep fried and very crispy. It has this sauce that is sweet and salty that&#39;s topped with cilantro that adds a nice touch. The staff is very friendly and has great recommendations if you&#39;re a first timer. The price is on a higher side but the food makes up for it. My gf usually orders cocktails from their menu and they are tasty and balanced. I would definitely recommend this to people who loves authentic Asian flavors.

The place has its good and bad rating for me. Place is easy to find. Parking on the street is free on Sundays otherwise pay by the meter or pay to park in the structure. Customer service was good at first, very attentive and explained the specials (drinks/food). Other servers, not so much. We ordered the fish sauce chicken wings, whole kai yaang, pork curry, coconut and jasmine rice, fried fish with tamarind sauce. 
1. Fish sauce chicken wings: soooo good! Almost ordered some to go. Not too salty or spicy, flavor was balanced.
2. Whole kai yaang: well, we didn&#39;t get a whole chicken because we would have to wait 20 min. They said they would bring half for now and half later, which never happened. We just got half.
3. Fried fish: good for 4 people, we devoured the fish given we were so hungry waiting because our food didn&#39;t come at the same time. The fish came with tamarind sauce that was slightly sweet and spicy. Delicious!
4. Pork Curry: the sauce was great, different from other curries i have tried. 
5. Drinks: soda not refillable? I could understand for Thai iced tea or alcoholic drinks but soda?hmmm. My friend got the tamarind margarita, that one was great!
We got the wings first, 10 min then we got the rice and fish, then they tell us about the wait for the chicken 15 min then the half chicken, 5 min then the pork curry. I just wish the entrees came in at the same time. I would go again for the chicken wings."

I mean, they popped up as a &#34;hot and new&#34; business, so we were expecting just that. 

Parking was pretty simple, $5 up front, and with validation, they give you $2 back. It was a little garage lot with pretty spacious parking. 

First off, the entrance to this restaurant is CRAMPED. Like, if you don&#39;t watch out, the next customer will squish you behind the door. The employees seem like they&#39;re trying really hard to be cheery... And for a Thai restaurant, it&#39;s odd to not see any Thai people. Anywho... I totally missed all these red flags when I first came in because the decor is super hip and cute. 

They took us to this little rickety table (it was rocking like a boat!) and gave us our menus. It took me some time to adjust because the items were all in Thai and the descriptions were SO long. I had to read every little thing to figure out what the dish was. 

Anyways, we got a sausage plate, the half Thai chicken, and some rice. Little did I know, I&#39;d be so thankful for that $2.50 bowl of rice (seriously they should have given that for free with the sad amount of food that they serve). 

My sausage entree comes out and I am severely disappointed. I mean I must have had a semblance of Oliver Twist. Ok so when they say sausage, they literally mean 1 sausage, cut up and spread out to take more room on the plate. Then there were some slices of what I think is pumpkin, 5 small pork rind fries (chicharones), and about 10 knotted green beans. Actually, it was more like 10 half green beans that someone took the time to tie into little knots. Seriously?! 

Oh and I almost forgot, there&#39;s a bowl of what they decided to call curry (it was ok but still not very sure that its curry). I ate it anyways because I was scared that I was still gonna be hungry. It was salty and the bowl was tiny, so I felt like I was eating chips dip. 

Lastly, the other 50% of my plate was a quarter of cabbage (literally just a big chunk) and a spread out piece of basil. How can half of the plate be garnish?? I tried to eat that cabbage too... No shame. 

The chicken was ok mostly because my plate was so horrendous. It was the only slightly good thing about this place. 

And by the way, I think they infused our water with peanuts..."

Be super cool and get dishes to share with some sticky rice and eat with your hands like an OG. Or dont and just crush a plate all on your own and leave with a real sense of accomplishment. Round out your meal with some Vietnamese coffee and ask for a glass with ice to do the cold version.... Sooo good. Also if you&#39;re a drinker the bar is great.

Authentic Thai fusion with authentic ingredients imported from the mainland which is awesome. I had a good experience here."

Located in Chinatown, Pok Pok serves up authentic (not fusion) Thai food, with a lot of ingredients imported from Thailand in a hip ambience reminiscent of a restaurant in Thailand. A plus of its location is that parking is that terribly hard to find (can park along the LA State Historic Park; Pok Pok also offers discounted parking at the Mandarin Plaza lot).

Onto the food:

Fish Sauce Wings - The signature dish here (and in almost all the reviews below and above). Super tasty in both the flavor and texture. The fish sauce marinade makes the wings saltier than you&#39;d expect so depending on your palette, you may find it overly salty. But nothing the accompany Vietnamese salad or a side of rice and water can&#39;t help with. Don&#39;t be afraid to get your hands dirty with this one.

Muu Paa Kham Waan (boar collar meat) - Great dish that would pair well with friends and drink. It ranks relatively high on the spicyness scale so be aware and dig into the iced mustard greens (which comes in a separate dish) to cool off the heat if needed. 

Khao Soi - Probably the best all around dish that can be enjoyed by pretty much anyone. Not too spicy, salty, or lopsided in flavor. Fair amount of chicken; curry was great; nice balance of crispy and non-crispy noodles.

The cocktails ($12) here were tasty as well - at least my Tamarind Whiskey Sour was. 

If you&#39;re looking for quality Thai food without taking a trip to Thailand, a stop by one of Andy Ricker&#39;s Pok Pok is the way to way. 
Is it on the pricer side of food? Sure ($15-20). 
Is it worth it? Yes."

God knows this area could use a facelift as well as some trendy new vibes.  The problem is -- you can bring Pok Pok to Chinatown, but you can&#39;t bring Portland and all its cool hipster vibes to Chinatown.  The location is inside a sleepy strip mall at the sleepy northern end of Chinatown on Broadway, that&#39;s problem #1.   Problem #2 -- while their signature fish sauce wings are totally tasty, the flavor is not unique, similar to Honey BBQ wings that can be found at many hole-in-wall China Wok type of fast food joints all over L.A., Also not many people would pay $15 for an order of 6 wings.  

Last but not least....something I noticed after I left, what was that 2.5% &#34;service charge&#34; on my bill before tax &amp; gratuity??  

I wish Pok Pok (and all new Chinatown businesses) best of luck."

Originally from Portland and with locations in NY and a couple of blocks away from their smaller location in LA, Pok Pok LA has created a new space at the beginning of Broadway in Chinatown. It is sad to see so many other restaurants go, but in comes the new Asian flare for Chinatown. I came here last night and while I did not have a reservation (definitely make a reservation here), the host informed us that the bar is always open to eat and drink. So that is where we ended up, mind you, that there are two floors, and two bars.

I shared some food with my brother and sister in law;
-Ike&#39;s Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings: at first, fish sauce on chicken wings? sounded interesting, but it worked and it was delicious, the fish sauce gave it a nice salty taste and the sugar helped balance it out. It looks like they use some red chilli and garlic when they fry up these bad boys. Your hands will get sticky, but don&#39;t worry, they give you wet naps.

-Khao Soi with chicken: khao soi is a curry base broth eaten with noodles, my mom makes something similar to this but with coconut and curry. The broth itself is sweet and a bit creamy. It was a good bowl for the cold winters. 

-Papaya Pok Pok: probably one of my favorite dishes I ate that night. While the dish is small, it packs a punch of tang and spice. It is their take on a papaya salad, it has these small red chillis in there that bring up the spice level, but cherry tomatoes to battle it down.

-Laap Thawt Isaan: I&#39;ve been pronouncing Laap as Larb for a long time, not sure how to exactly say or spell it considering I have seen it as larb, but the dish is one of the same. It is a minced dish of meat, here at Pok Pok, they serve it with pork, and they add pork cracklings which was awesome. It was pretty salty, so it was good to eat it with an order of sticky rice. 

All in all, great service, their water is pretty much coconut water, and the dishes can get pretty pricey."

Started with bbq cuttlefish which we loved. Then the tasty chicken wings which were to die for. Boar collar was next and would highly recommend. Absolutely loved everything about our meal. Oh and they have some funky cocktails that are yummy."

You bet that was the first thing we ordered when we came to the LA location. It&#39;s located inside the mandarin plaza and it&#39;s got a cute little outside seating area that&#39;s nicely lighted. We easily found parking on the street right outside the restaurant on a Sunday night. 

We ordered:

Ike&#39;s wings: best thing on the menu. Must order or your trip to pok pok isn&#39;t complete. Took me back to that cold and windy March night in Portland when I first tried them. 
Phat Hoi Laai (clams): this was also super tasty. Broth is spicy but makes for an appetizing starter. 
Jin Tup Roht Dii (flank steak): not impressed. I was expecting hearty flank steak but ended up being gyudon, yoshinoya style with a funky sauce. 
Cha Ca &#34;La Vong&#34; (catfish): the bed of vermicelli that the fish rested on was bland and flavorless but the sauce made it a little better. Least favorite dish of the  night for some of us. 
Chicken Khao Soi: good curry, tender chicken. 
Kaeng Heng Leh (pork belly): stew-like but didn&#39;t stand out. 

The experience was fun all in all. The staff was friendly and made sure our waters were filled and seemed knowledgable about their menu. To be honest, besides our 2 appetizers of clam and wings, the other dishes was pretty mediocre. 3 star food, 5 star service. But definitely come to get wings if you haven&#39;t tried them before!"

The food at Pok Pok was average, service was attentive, and I liked having different menu options other than the traditional southern Thai options. The menu, however, was difficult to navigate to the point where it was tough to make a choice.

Pork Belly Curry - A bit too salty for me, but the meat was tender.
Grilled chicken -- Flavorful, tender, and loved the dipping sauces
BBQ baby back -- I loved the bite on it but definitely not your fall-off-the-bones ribs. The 2 dipping sauces should be mixed to get the best bite. 
Vinegar soda -- one of my favorite drinks. Great tamarind taste.

Had a good meal. Wouldn&#39;t travel for the food."

The downsides aren&#39;t that bad.

I&#39;m a big game of Pok Pok Portland.  Ike&#39;s wings aren&#39;t as big and aren&#39;t as spicy.  So if you like spicy, you might want to ask them to add more Thai Chilis.  

Decor is kind of cheesy .. Sorry. I guess it&#39;s okay since we&#39;re in Chinatown.

Reservations recommended for large parties.   Or be prepared to wait for walk in list.

The good:

For party of 4:  get a whole bird.  Mary&#39;s whole bird is perfect.

Deep fried while butter fish .. Amazing.  Anyone that&#39;s been to the South Bay and been to Gina Lee&#39;s Bistro (closed now due to retiring) has amazing deep fried catfish... Pok Pok&#39;s butter fish is pretty on par.

Large head on prawns in clay pot with bean thread noodles .. Awesome.

Central Thai herbal salad was a nice break from the other dishes; also complimentary were the side dishes of cashews and shrimp chips.

Very nice selection of cocktails and beer.

Pretty happy, belly&#39;s full but not stuffed.

Thai iced tea with lime juice is a nice surprise.

Next time... Bring the family....

By the way..our server Bryce was awesome..good job"

Maybe I should have stuck with their chicken. Pretty much everything we tried here was salty. Papaya salad was good but less spicy. 

Almost every patron here was young and white except us... Are we really in China town? I guess that&#39;s the sign you should go to Thai town for a real Thai food."

The  interior is nicer than most of the little thai eateries but nothing too fancy.  The service here was good and the pandan leaf gives the water an interesting flavor.  Did I enjoy the food here?  For the most part yes and some of the dishes are more unique but it is more expensive than other Thai places

Do get:
Wings - So good, we got 2 orders
Neua Naam Tok (Flank steak) - great flavor and good to eat with rice
Kaeng hang leh
coconut rice

okay:
Brussels sprouts

Would skip:
Stripped seabass - my cousin loved this but i thought it was overpriced. 
Kai Yaang - Just chicken with 2 dipping sauces.  Get the full order b/c the half is really small"

We ordered the wings (spicy and sweet and crispy perfection), papaya salad and pork-belly curry. Scooped it all up with sticky rice by hand. Washed it down with icy cold Singha (on tap). 

Refreshingly great service, incredible food, fun, unpretentious location. This is LA #foodism at its best. 

I would probably not eat here if you have an aversion to spicy things.

I am dreaming about coming back already."

In short: the food was great and the service was great. The ambiance is casual and the restaurant was much larger than I was expecting. Arguably too big but it felt well managed. I bought tickets a couple of weeks ahead of time which is how you make reservations at Pok Pok LA. When we arrived at 7:30, the place felt empty.
By 9, it was busy. Loved the wings, pork belly curry, roasted chicken and most everything else we tried. The menu is huge but the servers had great suggestions. Similar vibe and food to Night Market but I found the food to be noticeably better. A couple of other things I loved: $10 corkage and water infused with Pandanus leaf. The water really settled down my palate and worked well with the food. I love little touches like that. I will definitely return."

What I did get to try was great, if... safe. We let our server know we&#39;re very experienced with Thai flavors and especially Thai spice, but nothing registered more than a 2.0 on the Rickter Scale. (See what I did there?) We also thought we would receive dishes one by one because our server said everything came out as it was ready, and instead, everything arrived at the same time after about 40 minutes of waiting. (We accidentally got tipsy because we didn&#39;t have anything to do besides drink on empty stomachs.)

The wings are predictably good, but I think going adventurous is the way to go. And next time, I&#39;ll request a condiment tray."

My co-workers got the Dine LA special and I got the pork belly curry, and we were not amazed by the food, but generally satisfied. When we got there, we were sitted right away, but then the wait time for the food to come out and the bill, was too long for us. We ended up spending about hour and half at the restaurant when we expected less than hour for our casual office lunch. I would come back but during working hours."

It&#39;s here and it does not disappoint! I can here for the soft opening tonight and you could not tell that this was their first day operating. We arrived at our reservation time and we were promptly seated. Our server quickly brought us a sample of their roasted penuts with spices. 

Drinks:
We quickly gravitated to the drink menu which we got the lychee drinking vinegar (very refreshing and not overpowering), and the salted plum vodka Collins which tastes like an alcoholic sweet plum drink you get in Asia, this was excellent. We later tried the mango Collins (a bit too sour from the lime zest), and then the hunny (grapefruit with lime, honey drinking vinegar and tequila) which was bomb!

Food:
Fish sauce wings (spicy or non spicy...we got the spicy) this is a must get. Perfectly crisp wings in a Caramelized glaze that is both sweet, salt and spicy. Fish sauce provides umami and is not overpowering at all. A+

Pok pok special - half a roast chicken and papaya salad. Chicken is perfectly cooked I don&#39;t know how they did it and he skin is great. The chicken itself is not super flavorful so the sauces it comes with are great. We also got a side of peanut sauce which went very well with the chicken. The papaya salad is one of the best I&#39;ve had. A-

Khao soi (chicken) - classic northern Thailand curry noodle dish. Two large pieces of chicken cooked to perfection bone in swimming in a rich and flavorful broth. Comes with usual pickled veggies and lime. Topped with fried noodles. This is the second best version of this dish in Los Angeles (super tough competition) after the restaurant named khao soi in Hollywood. A

Kaeng hang leh - braised ginger pork dish in a sweet and savory broth. The pork is perfectly cooked and melts in your mouth. Come with both pork belly and pork shoulder. The broth is like crack and goes well with coconut rice. A+

Sticky rice with durian custard - delicious sticky rice soaked in coconut sauce topped with durian custard that is not overpowering. A+

Service:
Can&#39;t remember our servers name but he was excellent, attentive and explained all the dishes throughly. Food came out reasonably fast. A

Tips
- reservations can be made through tok online. Reservations cost money but that full amount is applied towards your food. Smart idea to prevent cancellations or unnecessary reservations .
- parking is free for pick up (15 min) then validated for how long you stay
- hours to be updated once more finalized"
pok-pok-la-los-angeles-2,Dawnabelle R.,oVCdGLc82TYV0MZuk6RRaw,"Granada Hills, CA",0,1,1,180,43,J8DghxQEIbr9S_EcghU9mA,5.0,2015-11-02,"We LOVE Pok Pok. We&#39;ve had Pok Pok in Portland several times and had some of it just a week before visiting the new LA location. As soon as we found out about the soft opening, we made the earliest available reservation. With the $50 per person we had unlimited drinks and dessert and two entrees each. The new dish we ordered was the Kaeng Hang Leh: the pork belly was tender and full of flavor. We got our usual boar salad and, of course, Ike&#39;s spicy chicken wings! (Except we each got our own order of it!) Their cocktails are delicious and you must try their drinking vinegars. I recommend the lychee and pineapple. For dessert I had an Affogato with Vietnamese coffee. I finished off with the Kafae Boraan Yen which is a sock brewed Thai iced coffee made with Stumptown coffee. How very Portland! 

For two people we had some left overs. Having $50 per person to spend was a bit much, but it gave me the opportunity to try new things on the menu. We were there on a Wednesday evening and I was surprised that there were many free tables considering online reservations were slim pickins that week. One of the servers said that they were taking walk ins. However, you may want to check since they&#39;ve been open a few weeks now. 

The space is roomy, the building has parking available but this part of Chinatown also doesn&#39;t get as crowded, so you may be able to park on the street. The service needs some work, but I won&#39;t judge that too soon since they hadn&#39;t  officially opened.

So I came with my bad attitude and first encountered Sophie, a Farang bartendress. I must say a Farang girl behind the bar didn&#39;t impress, but then she slowly chipped away my attitude with her culinary knowledge and her bartending skills. The drinks were great, we had the Hunny and some other spicy delicious drink. We then got the wings (not spicy enough), the duck laarb (AMAZING) and the papaya salad (never my fav, but here, delicious).  I was stunned to silence when Sophie revealed that chef too, was Farang. I don&#39;t know how it is possible a Farang can get the combo of flavors like a Thai, but he does. It is official, I am a Pok Pok convert. And I will be back!"

While the food was fantastic - a solid 5 stars, I did feel that the service needed improvement, however it&#39;s a soft opening so that&#39;s what the point of it is. The service issues were however specific to my server only who  left a dent in my dining experience, however, it&#39;s really about the food, and the food was fantastic so keeping my review to 5 stars as I am confident this is something that will be corrected.

I loved the overall low-key/more casual, inviting and warm decor of the place.  The colorful tablecloths add a fun, bright, low key vibe and the staff is mostly dressed in some variation of blue/dark blue denim and bus boys in &#34;pok pok&#34; tees. 

The Kaeng Hang Leh was absolutely delicious.  Definitely different from any other curry that I&#39;ve ever had and I thoroughly enjoyed every bite of it.  Hence how angry #1 below makes me, argh! There&#39;s just a ton of flavor packed into the tender piece of pork and just brings a delightful warm, comforting feeling. Pairs well with the coconut rice (probably any of their rice).

Their menu is full of dishes that you don&#39;t typically see at your usual Thai spot.  Feels authentic and packed with flavor - I am definitely looking forward to returning with a larger group to try more of the extensive menu.

The misses:

1) When I ordered the famous Ike&#39;s Vietnamese fish sauce wings, I was asked if I would like the spicy version, I asked, &#34;How spicy?&#34; (as I would think many would ask?) my server simply replied with &#34;I can&#39;t tell you how spicy it is.  Everyone has a different scale/measure of spicy.&#34; Of course I understand that, but can&#39;t you at least help guide me or provide me with some sort of bench such as, &#34;If you think Sriracha is spicy, you *probably* will/will not think this is something&#34; or &#34;Most people say it&#39;s _____&#34; just to provide some level of help?  Instead he just stared blankly at me impatiently waiting for me to make a decision.

2) My leftover Kaeng Hang Leh (Pork belly + Pork shoulder North Thai sweet curry) $16 - of which I packed 2/3 of the entire dish, was missing from the bag. DOH! I did call because this dish was more than half the cost of my meal, so this is disappointing.  The manager Ako was apologetic and promised to make it up to us."

Came here on a Saturday night around dinnertime. We didn&#39;t have a reservation (but I would totally recommend you making one before coming), but we got lucky and they were able to score a table for two right away. 

Warning: So when you come here, don&#39;t expect your typical Thai food. I thought we&#39;d be ordering some pad thai, pad see ew, some tom yom soup but NOPE. Pok pok focuses on Northern Thai cuisine, so its an entirely different region and unique style of Thai food that will take your taste buds out of this world. COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. And I loved everything about it!

The menu is freaking huge. But this is what we ordered:
--VIET FISH SAUCE WINGS: BOMB.COM. A1 A+. This is a must. Absolutely delicious, perfectly fried wings with the tangiest best sauce. I could seriously eat an entire plate of this if somebody didn&#39;t stop me. If you like wings, you&#39;ll love these. 
--PAPAYA SALAD (ISAAN STYLE): Pretty good but not too stand out. The menu even has a buyer beware disclamer on the &#34;isaan style&#34; salad indicating that it is seriously SUPER HOT. It was definitely spicy, but not as spicy as I expected. Still tasty! But this dish is PERFECT paired with the sweet pork belly curry.
--SWEET PORK BELLY CURRY (Kaeng Hang Leh: ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. So we asked our server what would be the best third dish to complement what we had already ordered and he recommended the curry! This did not taste like typical thai curry at all. The curry was more like a sweet sauce that was so delicious poured over rice. The pork was perfect and tender. It was a stand out dish that I would never think about ordering. As I mentioned above, I highly recommend eating this with the papaya salad as the sweet and acidic combo was perfect. 

Between two people, this was the perfect amount of food. Although I admit, we were pretty stuffed since we just kept stuffing our mouths. It&#39;s just that good.

ALSO, there&#39;s something about the water they serve here that&#39;s really delicious. You&#39;ll notice it when you drink it!

I can&#39;t wait to come back again to try more things from the menu."

NOTE that my true rating is 3.5. This is primarily due to the lack of flow in the service (typical for a new restaurant). They just need to work out the kinks. My personal opinion is that service is a fundamental part of the restaurant experience. However, I will be back again because the food was great. 

Reservations or No Reservations: 
I booked a table for a party of four a week ahead on a Saturday at noon. There is a $15 fee per person for lunch and $20 for dinner reservations. This amount goes towards your bill at the end of the meal. When we arrived, there were a number of empty tables both outside and inside. I&#39;m not sure if it was absolutely necessary for us to book reservations ahead of time for lunch. There was no wait. However, if you&#39;re coming here for dinner, I would recommend doing so. Based on previous yelp reviews, there is quite a wait later in the day. 

Service: 
Our waiter was very nice. He was extremely knowledgeable about both the drink and food menu. When we asked him about dish recommendations, he went into great detail about each one. I loved how much he knew, but the explanations were a little over the top. Literally felt like 5 minutes per dish. 

Overall, the service was a bit disorganized. A runner incorrectly delivered four dishes to our table. We had to ask the couple next to us whether the food was theirs and when they said yes, the embarrassed runner nervously transferred the dishes onto their table without an apology. He did this so quickly, he left one plate of food behind which we nicely gave to our neighboring eaters. 

We also had way to many runners servicing out table. They hardly smiled and abruptly removed empty plates from our table. 

What we ordered:

Ike&#39;s Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings - We got the spicy version. Don&#39;t worry, it wasn&#39;t the &#39;my mouth is numb&#39; and &#39;I can&#39;t feel my face kind&#39; of heat level. You know when you look at a plate or food and think, damn that looks so good. Well, it was THAT delicious. We chowed those two plates of wings down to the bones. These wings are famous for a reason. Don&#39;t forget about the pickled daikon radish and carrots! Eat them. They compliment the sweet, sticky, spicy goodness. 

Cha Ca &#34;La Vong&#34; - Lightly fried catfish marinated in turmeric and sour rice over vermicelli noodles. For those of you who are turned off by catfish because you think they taste like mucky bottom feeders, order this dish and be proven wrong. The catfish is delicate and cooked to silky perfection. The herbs and peanuts give the dish a great balance of flavors and textures.

Neua Namm Tok - Spicy flank steak salad. Again, this had just the right amount of heat. The table all agreed this was a favorite. 

Da Chom&#39;s Laap Meung - Spicy minced pork salad with aromatic herbs and spices. Served with a side of Phak Sot (fresh romaine and herbs). This dish was fine, but nothing special.

Pok Pok Bloody Mary - Strong approval from a friend who knows his drinks very well. 

Cha Yen - Thai milk tea. This hit the spot alright.

Naam Krachiap - Thai syle hibiscus tea. My friend ordered this said it was overly sweet and returned it for a Sprite. When she asked for a refill, the runner rudely responded, &#34;We DON&#39;T do refills&#34; as if she was an idiot for even asking. 

Grand Total:

$120 for a group of four - 5 dishes (2 orders of wings) and 4 drinks. $30/person without gratuity.

Pok Pok LA is a higher priced restaurant than your typical spot in Thai Town, so please keep this in mind before you decide to eat here. This is not the type of place you come on a weekly basis, but it&#39;s worth the trip and spend. Some might complain that the portions are too small, but c&#39;mon guys, would you rather eat a giant subpar meal for cheap or great dishes for a few extra bucks? So treat yourself. Also, we all left the restaurant SO FULL, sadly, we did not have room for dessert."

And I have to say that the service at the bar was actually much better than the service I&#39;ve received sitting at a table.

I&#39;ve explored almost the entire menu, but I keep going back to the chicken wings and the egg salad. OMG the chicken wings are so so unbelievably good. They are not your typical buffalo style wings, but instead ten times better (warning must like fish sauce). They come with these super tasty pickled vegetables too. Normally I would say get 1 order per every 2 people. You won&#39;t want to share. The egg salad is my favorite salad on the menu. Super light and citrus-y.

The drinks are also really tasty but are a little pricy for the amount of drink you get."

The menu is standard - tortas, burritos, tacos, etc... but there was a secret meat menu. I ordered the Cochinita pibil burrito which I found on Yelp... it wasn&#39;t on the regular menu. It&#39;s basically spicy pork... which was good. The size is also huge! The only problem is that it&#39;s a bit expensive - over $10 for a burrito and chips. Hmm...

SERVICE:
Nice. Standard. 

LOCATION:
It&#39;s really small. So it&#39;s hard to find seats during peak time."

Always great food and service. They have daily specials like 2 chicken tinga tacos for $4 plus the horchata is some of the best in the city.

Came around 4pm on a Sunday for a lunch/dinner snack and was pretty satisfied (sadly not as wowed as I thought I would be). 

They have a pretty large menu and breakfast options all day long! My friend got the Huevo Rancheros which he was pretty satisfied with. And I got chips+guac, a carne asada taco, and 2 chicken mole tacos (I was really hungry...).

The chips + guac ($3) were just decent. I personally like my guac a little chunky, and was not a fan of how overly-mushed the avocados in the guac were. It was still tasty, but the texture was a bit off to me. 

The carne asada taco was flavorful, and came with a little bit of onions and cilantros for a nice kick of extra flavor. I really liked the chicken mole tacos! Every mole recipe is special and beautiful in its own way... but I REALLY liked the bold tastes of the mole and how it wasn&#39;t too sweet. The 3 tacos came out to be $5. Not bad considering the price to taste ratio! 

Sidenote: small parking lot nearby, if you can&#39;t get a spot good luck because the streets were pretty filled with cars and we had to circle around twice to get a spot. Also there&#39;s a $5 credit card minimum!"

Recommended popular taco selections: shrimp, pork and pollo were awesome! We liked the pork the best. Pollo was spicy. The mini tortilla was soft. Sauces were incredible. Tacos are pricey compare taco joints, but they&#39;re at a different level. They taste wayyyy better than Diablo gourmet tacos and wayyy cheaper.  

Opened since 2015. New improved gem of the area. Outdoor patio is enclosed and cute. Add some plants and it reminds me of Gloria&#39;s in silverlake. Dog friendly since it&#39;s small but open space. 

Great vibe for causal sit in. You&#39;ll confuse this place for any other taco joint, but you&#39;re in for a treat. Also they&#39;re part of eat24!!! Looking forward to deliveries from this place. 

Parking is super difficult since it&#39;s only free street parking. The back of it attached to a liquor store and 2 parking spots, 1 for disability.

On my first visit, i tried:

*Cochinita pibil tacos, 2 for $4- the slowly roasted pork was juicy, flavorful and just a tad spicy. I recently tried this Yucatan dish for the first time and was very surprised to see it here. The corn tortillas are small but totally satisfying. Topped with pickled purple onion. 

*Fish tacos: soo juicy and tasty as well. You can tell the tomato and cilantro were all fresh.

*Asada taco-$1 and change. It was good too but looked kinda like ground beef

I usually have to add salt or squirt lots of lime to my tacos so the meats aren&#39;t bland since I don&#39;t add any of the spicy salsas. No need with these. 

I returned a week after and tried:

*Ceviche- $4: tilapia, tomatoes and other chopped into very small pieces and served with tortilla chips. Not too sour, just perfect.

*Taco al pastor: had a crunch to it and served with some green salsa

*Shrimp Burrito-$6.5: sooo good! not too big but the shrimp is freshly grilled and it had a garlic sauce that was super yummy and made it extra juicy 

*Chicken mole- $9.5: also very good and served with rice 

*Horchata was not my favorite, it had that powdery texture

The place is small. You order from a small window and are seated in their covered sitting area with no AC. You can park in the little lot they share with a liquor store or look for street parking.  They take your order on an Ipad and accept credit cards, which is very convenient.

Some people complain about the prices. They are definitely a bit pricier than food trucks or Mexican places but you can see and taste the difference.

Can&#39;t wait to go back when I&#39;m in the area!"

The place didn&#39;t look like much from the outside but I just felt I had to stop.

Sitting beside me were the most irresistible carnitas and pastor tacos... I almost had to pull the car over and we almost didn&#39;t make it home.

The red salsa lit my mouth on fire and tantalizing waft of spices....I can&#39;t really go into details beyond the moment I ripped the foil off the plate.

I am a creature of habit... I am stuck on their bean &amp; cheese burrito &amp; carnitas tacos. 

The way the melt the cheese in a skillet first is their trick, it gives it a fried cheese taste.  The carnitas is slow cooked the thrown on the flat top for that perfect crispness!! I love the flavor of the chipotle salsa but it is on the mild side.

THE AMBIANCE:

This Mexican food shop has been operating since about ten (10) months ago, is small, and nice for a half restaurant/half taco stand kind of place. There are Mexican decorations that are cute. It is run by a father and his two (2) sons, which is pretty neat! I love family-owned venues. The floor and tables are new. I did not see a restroom. The menus hang from the ceiling or are posted on the walls and ordering window. Even though seating is outside it is surrounded by a wall with a gate, which makes it feel more cozy and private.

THE FOOD:

We tried tacos, enchilada plate (1 cheese, 1 chicken, beans, and rice), and a side of  the guacamole and chips ($3.00). The guy who took our order was one of the sons. He was really kind and allowed me to try their different mild sauces in order to choose which sauce I wanted on my enchiladas. I tried the tomatillo sauce (green) and the chipotle sauce (orange). The tomatillo sauce had a spicy kick and the chipotle sauce was the mildest. He allowed me to get one echilada in the tomatillo and the other in the chipotle! I was happy.

The food came out on nice plates (non-paper). I noticed that the chicken in the enchilada was grilled/fried with seasoning, which is nice compared to other places that just cook, lightly season, and break the chicken apart. Gives it extra flavor. The beans and rice were okay. The tacos were very tasty. They were on point - the meat, veggies, tortilla, and meat. The asada tacos were the winners above chorizo and pastor tacos.

Next time I am ordering tacos!

THE TIPS:

Park on the street and bring a jacket! There is one (1) heating lamp and one (1) tv. They also have a rock on a chair that is a disguised speaker. Funny."

I was not wooed to the extent that I felt compelled to give 5 stars. 
I ordered an al pastor burrito and guacamole with chips.
The burrito was wrapped nicely and the first bite was full of amazingly seasoned pork, but then a big chunk of gristle/cartilage/fat was in the middle  of the bite. 
No problem-- except it kept happening. Maybe one in every three bites, a chunk of inedible pork, leading me to question the quality of the meat they use. 
I tried to distract myself with the guacamole. A small portion, but lots of chips. They were however not salted that much and very hard, guess thats good for withstanding a good scooping. Guacamole was fine but again too much lime was used. 
Salsas were also average. The salsa verde was too acidic and their red salsa was very basic.

How is it possible that this little austere taco shop apologetically sharing a lot with a liquor shack has the most flavorful and fresh tasting fish tacos for  $4.00!!?!? I normally don&#39;t eat my corn taco tortilla because I&#39;d rather spend my calories on chips and guacamole,  but gosh dern it- my taco shell was so moist and flavorful (it&#39;s gotta be homemade or close to it) I just had to! 

And let&#39;s talk GUAC! I know they must be diluting the avocado down a little, but whatever they&#39;re mixing in (seemed like small chucks of cucumber?) made it taste even more fresh, healthy and zingy! The guac was not overly acidic or salty, it was perfect! And CHEAP!

I had to get their shrimp burrito as well, for, you know, dinner in 5 hours, and it too was delicious and flavorful. 

Finally the salsas- yes, yes, yes! The orange one had great flavors without being crazy picante, and the verde was equally yummy.

This taqueria is probably my favorite in LA and I love that they are closest to where I live. There are only a couple of un-extraordinary taquerias on Vermont in East Hollywood, but absolutely none north of Fountain and between Vine and Vermont. They not only have delicious burritos, but a good genuine horchata and quiet, low-key atmosphere. The food tastes as good as a couple of extra minutes it takes to prepare it. Usually burritos are really fast, throw tortilla on the grill, slam, add beans, slam, onions, rice, whatevs, slam. Like what kind of inexpensive taqueria carefully grills their vegetables and prepares them with zucchini? The few more minutes definitely makes a difference.

There is only one guy ever working every time I&#39;ve come in, so it can be a bit of a wait if there are multiple people. Like, he really takes care of carefully making everything taste like the time it took to prepare. Feel free to sit down and wait as it does take a while.

I had the shrimp burrito and it was amazing!  The seasonings weren&#39;t the usual ho hum Mexican  spices at all.  The burrito was flavorful down to the last bite.  A lot of times with a burrito I have to leave or tear off some of the tortilla because the flavor is wack.  Nope not here.

It&#39;s a simple place, a traditional taco stand with the usual selection of meats. They were out of lengua, so we ordered a mix of carne asada, al pastor, buche (pig stomach), chorizo, etc.  Horchata, Jamaica, Mexican Coke and Fanta. All the usual stuff. The cheese quesadillas were excellent, we had plain cheese and also chicken. Everything is scratch made here, the six different salsas will meet the needs of any spiciness.

The meat was bad and their soup wasn&#39;t tasty. We got a room, but the waiters rarely came to check on us and forgot our requests several times. Come on at least your bulgogi should be good....

They don&#39;t manage their bathrooms either. The female room was very dirty. Two toilets were not working properly and the sink wasn&#39;t drained..."

They make it easy to order with suggested set courses - a good mix of prime beef, bulgogi, brisket, pork belly, kalbi, steamed egg, salads, and banchan. For 3-5 people, this set came out to $120. Food is better than Kang Ho Dang, with zero wait.

1 star:  Never again.
2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.
3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

it may sound crazy, but a large part of this 5-star review is based on a single dish that comes &#34;free&#34; with the meal, the dwaengjang jigae.  This is, BY FAR, the best dwaengjang jigae that comes with a meal that you don&#39;t order and pay for separately.  Most kalbi places that give you jigae ends up giving you glorified dwaengjang gook with more stuff in it.  The jigae is thick and rich and pungent - country style like this guy&#39;s parents.  

And that&#39;s what appeals to me about this place generally - they go for a more Korean-centric, country style in their menu as opposed to the high-end LA-style kalbi at Chosun and so many other places.

They have a goolbi dish - totally dried out and THEN, fried again.  Served with a traditional accompaniment - cold green tea that you dip your rice into and eat with the fish.  Not a huge fan of goolbi, but this was interesting and pretty good.

We got 3 meats - Kobe flank, ggot ssal, and Gangnam bulgogi.  The first two were great, nothing special, just good quality beef.  Gangnam bulgogi has almost no marinade on it, and has a smokier flavor than regular bulgogi.  It was tender and subtle.  I liked it.  Not love, but like.  It could grow on me.

The banchan game here is mixed.  You don&#39;t get much, but what you get tastes pretty darn good.  Their egg jjim is very good here.  They also had a dwaengjang pepper banchan that was great.  Their kimchi was average, and though the texture of their jang jorim was softer than normal, with rice, it tasted pretty good.

My dad ordered a side of naeng myun and he and I both approve.  Most of us ended the meal with some nooreung ji - this was the biggest disappointment.  No big crispy bits left at all.  They let the nooreung ji sit in the water for quite some time until all the rice falls apart and imparts its flavor to the water.  It was a cross between a tea and jook, rather than the nooreung ji I&#39;ve been used to.  I wouldn&#39;t recommend it.

So all in all, a surprising meal.  Pleasantly surprised."

The combo special pricing is not available for the rooms. The meat quality is above average, and the marinades are subtle and nuanced. The cold noodles are also refreshing and among the better noodles in Koreatown. 

My main gripes are that the AC vent was super strong so our room was freezing, and that the waitress somewhat let it be known that she was having a bad day. As we made requests through the night, the waitress got progressively more tightlipped and curt. I&#39;m not sure if they were shortstaffed or if she was having a bad day but it was quite disappointing especially when we were seated in a VIP room. The discounted combos are not applicable inside the room so I would expect better service. The waitress was practically grumbling as she was portioning the food. I believe her name starts with S."

Came here with parents and MIL, and we ordered the combo for 4-5 people ($120).  It came with banchan, rib eye, Kobe kkotsal or bulgogi, chadol, marinated kalbi, samgyupsal, soybean paste stew, and nooloongji.

First of all, I knew it was going to be good when I saw how they served their banchan.  Clean, aesthetically pleasing, and the plates were nice.  This was reaffirmed when they served cold noodles in brass bowls (we ordered this separately), which is the traditional Korean plate/bowl material.  Kinda what fine china is to the western world.

Meat:  Excellent quality.  We chose kkotsal, and it was melt in your mouth delicious.  I&#39;ve had kkotsal at other places, and this place had the best I&#39;ve had in a long time.  I give props to even their marinated galbi, since other places make it too sweet and salty, but this place kept it simple and traditional with more subtle flavors.  All other cuts of meat were very good quality.

Banchan:  The reason why I was very impressed was they pay attention to detail such as the steamed egg, soybean paste stew, and the nooloongji (rice porridge).  Soybean paste stew was seasoned well, and the rice porridge was made correctly, which is rare.  Traditional rice porridge is supposed to have the crusty bottom of the rice pot boiled with water, not just water added to regular rice.  When it&#39;s done right, you get very subtle charred flavor with crunchy rice bits, and starchy broth.

Noodles:  Their cold noodles were delish!  The noodles were on point, chewy and bouncy, the way it&#39;s supposed to be.

Also unlike many Kbbq restaurants, this place would be suitable for a more formal dinner if you needed a nicer ambience for group dinner.  D√©cor is nice, and the service was very attentive.

Overall, I&#39;d come back in a heartbeat, it was one of the better  Kbbq meals I&#39;ve had in Ktown recently.  Granted there are many good Kbbq restaurants now, but I&#39;d add this place as one of my top 5 for sure.  Hope it maintains its good quality, recommend!"

It was a Tuesday night, so there was no wait.  The restaurant was also pretty empty.  The d√©cor had a pretty modern feel to it.  There were also a lot rooms, which I imagine you can host private parties.  Our hostess was very nice and I got seated right away.  I was craving meat, so I decided on the bulgogi (which I heard was their specialty).  I chose the Gangnam Style (tee-hee) bulgogi because the waitress told me that it was a lot less sugary.  If you want it more sugary, I would suggest the LA style bulgogi.  The grill is charcoal, which is a little different from most of the Korean BBQ places.  The banchan came out soon after.  It was the usual dishes of kimchi, fish cakes, egg, salad, etc.  While I was munching on the banchan, the meat came out . 

Yum to meat! It definitely tasted fresh and had a melt in your mouth quality.  In addition, since the bulgogi was grilled over charcoal, it had a little bit of a different taste, which I enjoyed.  Also, the waiter came by and cooked the meat, so I never had to actually cook the meat myself (which I am terrible at). The waiters were definitely attentive and I never had to wait too long for refills of banchan and water.  

Overall, a pretty good experience for a bulgogi Korean BBQ place.  I would definitely come here again.  I don&#39;t know what the parking situation is like since I walked over from another building, but I imagine there would be parking underneath the building."

All I can say is ...Whoa! This should be posted as an example of &#34;how not to respond to customers publicly on Yelp.&#34;

Isaac K.: &#34;First of all I have reported your fake review on yelp. 
On 22nd Friday night was busy as always, we are never &#34;empty&#34; on weekends, and our kitchen closes at 10:30.  If our kitchen was closed how did you order food from us? Very strange. 
You mentioned that you never got your water or utensils so you had to flag our server to get one until your food came out? We never seat our customers until table is set up with table mat, utensils, and NAPKINS.  
We first serve drinks THEN take order. It is the basic of operating restaurant I&#39;m sure you know. 
I&#39;ve looked through my surveillance camera to see which of our staff would do such a horrible thing but I have not seen ANYONE do what you claim here on this review. Furthermore I was eager to see who you were. 
It&#39;s funny because I have seen a lot of PARKS BBQ customers at our restaurant and you mention how great parks bbq is.
We don&#39;t appreciate this kind of joke at our restaurant, you can go to parks all you want. But please don&#39;t write fake reviews.&#34;

My response:  &#34;I&#39;m sorry Issac K., I don&#39;t have time to write fake reviews for fun. As you can see, I dine out A LOT so I do know the difference between great service vs. very bad service. Please take this feedback seriously. This is not a joke.&#34; -Anne A.

LA Times food critic, Jonathan Gold, recently raved about their premium bulgogi, but unfortunately #WTF is how I felt while dining at this restaurant tonight.

This is the first time I left a restaurant without leaving a tip and it felt SO good.

This restaurant tops my list as worst restaurant experience EVER.

I have dined at many restaurants around the world, including Korean restaurants in LA and OC, and this is definitely the worst of them all.

Never did I feel so disgusted by the lack of attention and service. I felt discriminated here for either for not being Korean or not white...  or maybe because we did not want to order table top Korean barbecue. 

We were only in the mood for cold Korean soup on this warm summer evening and selected this restaurant for the naengmyeon on the menu, but we were told that they could not make it for us. 

We were told that we only could only order their barbecue at a minimum of 2 orders for around $60, any hot clay pot stews (jjigae), or any of the bibimbap options because &#34;their kitchen was closed&#34; around 9 pm. Keep in mind that their listed hours of operation on Yelp says that they close at 11 pm.

When we placed our order, we asked for water that we never received until my friend stood up to flag someone down. Of course, no refills on our waters either. Keep in mind the restaurant was almost empty on a Friday night.

I should have walked out at that point when banchan was dropped off and we received no silverware or chopsticks. 

My friend had to get up from her seat to get our utensils. They didn&#39;t even bother apologizing that we had to get up to get own utensils or flag them down for water.

I didn&#39;t have a napkin the entire time during dinner. We never received any silverware, spoons for our soups,  or chopsticks or a even full place setting for me.  Nothing in front of me. Nothing.

They must have thought we wanted to eat with our bare hands. 

They were so quick to give us our bill (which I consider so rude). We had to walk up to front desk to pay because I could not wait to get out of this restaurant.

At their price point, I would rather eat at Park&#39;s BBQ or Chosun Galbee for a Korean &#34;fine dining&#34; experience with much better service. Park&#39;s is among the best for service at a Korean restaurant in LA along with Jun Won and Kang Hodong Baekjong. 

Service in my experience at Korean restaurants is most of the time is non-existent (hello, table buzzers) or unfriendly so I always set my expectations really low -- REALLY LOW -- and allow the Korean restaurant to surprise me with great service. Jun Won recently blew me away with their hospitality and service. I felt like I was dining at an Auntie&#39;s home.

This is the worst of the worst of all my dining experiences.

I told the host on my way out why I was not leaving a tip and she didn&#39;t seem to be apologetic or even seem to care that I was so upset.

With so many Korean dining options in Koreantown, please do me and yourself a favor and skip this one. 

I don&#39;t care how great your bulgogi is or if you are a chain restaurant from Seoul or if Mr. Gold loves your restaurant -- 

If your service is crap in America, people will never come back."

First of all, one of the best, high quality meats I&#39;ve ever tasted! My favorite is the Prime Ggot Sal (Flower Meat) &amp; the Gangnam Style Bulgogi. Their Bulgogi is not the same regular bulgogi you can find at other restaurants - the meat is so tender and juicy. I&#39;ve never really liked bulgogi, but I only like Gwang Yang&#39;s. If you&#39;re one of those who don&#39;t like bulgogi because it&#39;s too sweet, I highly recommend you try GY&#39;s.
I also recommend their Eun Dae Goo Jorim (Spicy Braised Cod Fish). The fish is very soft and tender; can&#39;t get enough of it! Also, their Yook Hwe (Beef Tartare) is super good too... Just thinking about it makes me want some!

For lunch, I either order the Yook Hwe Bibimbap (Beef Tartare Mixed Rice) or the Galbi Tang (Beef Short Ribs Soup).

Although their prices aren&#39;t cheap, for the quality they serve it&#39;s definitely worth it. And their servers are very friendly and attend tables well. Make sure you ask if they have special combo deals... I think starting from $70 you get to try their best meats."

The naengmyeon is real good because i like the noodles they use and it goes good with lots of vinegar added in. I like vinegar.

Galbi is good. They don&#39;t really give you that much so it feels a little pricey.

I also tried the bulgogi + naengmyeon combo and it was good too. However, during lunch they have a discount on the naengmyeon + galbi combo so I usually get that instead

Service is slightly better than most Korean restaurant, but there are some off days as expected.

Side dishes are good. I like the kimchi. I like restaurant kimchi.

When I want naengmyeon, which is all the time, I like going here."

There seemed more booth seats in Gwang Yang, still very nice.
We had cold noodle(Naengmyun combo) and bulgogi, spicy cold noodle &amp; kimchee jun.
We got three banchans in nice little dishes, no kimchee or other namuls.
Then came my spicy cold noodle, which was too spicy. I like spicy food and can eat jalapinos,
though it was almost too spicy. I needed to drink soup continuously!
It was very tasty, not too sweet either. Bulgogi came with combo was good.
Kimchee jun was excellent, thin, not greasy just perfect.
The price, I can&#39;t complain, cause we had lunch specials.
Parking was valet, though a little bit confusing. Zion market and Gwang Yang using the parking place next to each other, that makes a bit confusing."

There were three of us, and the gentleman who made the reservation had made sure we got a private room so that we could talk. The restaurant&#39;s interior is modern and chic and the private rooms are very nice. Service was excellent; they checked on us frequently and came as soon as we rang the bell. 

I&#39;ve eaten at several Korean BBQ places but I usually defer to my lunch partners for ordering since they are Korean. We got the the Gwang Yang bulgogi gangnam style and the galbi short ribs, seafood pancake, steamed egg, and of course all the banchan. Everything was delicious. The meat&#39;s high quality is evident; both types were tender and full of flavor, and were cooked perfectly by our waitress. 

The seafood pancake was really good as well and it was large enough for the three of us (with some left over). It was made with a generous amount of seafood (mostly shrimps) and large pieces of scallion. 

Steamed egg- served piping hot and cooked just enough so that it was quite soft and not overly done. Banchan included salad, broccoli, kimchi, radish soup, and a few other dishes. 

We were brought a plate of orange slices (very sweet and juicy) at the end of our meal. I would definitely return, although if I came on my own it would probably have to be a special occasion due to the price. But it&#39;s worth it."

It&#39;s so good. I love meat and fat, but I usually stay away from bulgogi because I don&#39;t like the quality or that grisly/bubbly fat on it. So if you&#39;re like me, I encourage you to put your past bulgogi experiences aside and try the Gwang Yang Bulgogi here. It&#39;s not like any bulgogi you&#39;ve ever had. The quality, texture, and flavor will win you over with the first bite. Even my two-year old, who will only eat high-quality meat (don&#39;t know where she got that from), devours the bulgogi here. I know it may be hard for you to take the word of a two-year old, but sometimes you just have to trust the simplicity and innocence of a toddler.

Service is great and the restaurant is very clean.

Gwang Yang is exponentially better than the restaurant that used to occupy that space (I can&#39;t even remember the name of it at this point)."

He served us with good care. We ordered $100 combo for 3-4 ppl. Suppose there are 4 kinds of meats with egg pot and bean paste soup. we finished 4 meats and everything is smooth. We requested cook slowly to wait for our friend and is ok. When it came to the end, we felt like our foods are not fulfilled and asked what&#39;s in the $100 menu. They didn&#39;t mention egg pot and bean paste soup. We asked for it and server D said I remembered to put egg pot on ur table already. It&#39;s obviously not right cuz all the dishes is on our table and nothing has been removed. He insisted he did gave us, but anyway, why would we lie!  Later on egg pot came and bean paste soup also served..... We felt like we weren&#39;t treated well and just want to express here.

I went to get some lunch with my clinical classmates and after originally waiting for Boiling Crab for about an hour and a half, we decided to go here instead.  I was glad we were seated right away and that we didn&#39;t have to wait for a long time to get in.  

When we got inside Gwang Yang BBQ, I noticed how spacious and luxurious the place was.  I felt like I was in a fine dining area in Korea!  For a large group of us we ended up getting the group special and awesome treatment from our servers who cooked the meat for us.  Like in any Korean BBQ establishment, we were intoduced with top-notch appetizers in small plates.  Appetizers such as kimchi and tofu  were presented before the pork belly, bulgogi in Gangnam Style and brisket (which came in last) arrived one after another.  While enjoying our meals, which were cooked to perfection and were deliciously devoured,  we had the steamed egg - one of my favorities - that was also excellent (didn&#39;t taste like burned food at the bottom) and the spicy miso soup, which I unfortunately did not like due to its spicy taste.

The service here was excellent. I have no complaints. 

Despite of the expensive price, Gwang Yang BBQ exceeded my expectations.  

P.S. They do have validation here if you park at the parking lot next to Gwang Yang BBQ."

We did Combo 1, which is bulgogi, brisket, can&#39;t remember the 3rd meat, I wanna say ribeye, steamed egg, jjigae, and rice porridge: $70 for 2-3 people. The meat is good quality, but somehow didn&#39;t wow me (I think it was leaner, not much fat content for flavor - a plus for some, not for me). They go for a subtler flavor with their bulgogi (not too sweet), which I appreciate. Portions are on the small side - we both got full but not stuffed, so if you have a bigger appetite, order more meat. Banchan doesn&#39;t include rice/radish wrappers.

Staff was really attentive during the meal, even telling us when our meat was cooked, but after we finished they never came to deliver the bill - we had to wave them down. Also never got refills on water.

They do have private VIP rooms though, which is pretty baller."

The meat quality is great. We ordered the non-marinated prime beef short ribs and it really melted in my mouth. We also ordered bulgogi that came in beef stock with  noodles and vegetables. The beef cooked over the flame much better. I didn&#39;t really enjoy the bulgogi in stock and wished we ordered the regular bulgogi. 

Why a three star?

Service was SLOW. We had an older lady server and she could not remember anything we ordered. It was a group of four and we ordered soju, beer, and coke along with our meat order. She literally complained if we order all this at once it&#39;s difficult for her. Excuse me? She looked liked she could be my friends mom so I sympathized and APOLOGIZED. After about the fourth time she forgot including delays in our meat I feel generous for rating it a three star.

Four people, four servings of meat (we could have ate more but when your food takes forever to come out people get full), two bottles of soju, a bottle of beer, and a coke = $175 not including tip.

Is it worth it? Hell no. I would rather go to Quarters."

I was like, &#34;Whaattt?&#34; But it is LA, and it didn&#39;t sound altogether unreasonable. Well, I went on a hunt for said Gang Bang BBQ on my recent LA visit, and I discovered that I had misunderstood her (dirty mind!). Ah, Gwang Yang! I had to visit after thinking of this so many times, and I was happy that I did.

The restaurant is upscale and beautiful, and not nearly as crowded as some of the other options across the street that are more popular with the younger crowd. This is an established Korean BBQ restaurant that has been delighting customers for years, and it is still doing it. The meat quality here is outstanding, and the service too is attentive and warm. The hosts and servers were eager to make sure that I had a great experience, and they never seemed phased that I was there to enjoy the BBQ experience alone. I chose the Gangnam style so that I could enjoy the exquisite taste of the meat in the light marinade.

There are an increasing amount of options for Korean BBQ in the neighborhood, but this is a solid and reliable choice in a quieter and more upscale space than other offerings in the area. Enjoy the gang bang!"

Not like other old school KBBQ restaurants, with marinated beef whatever parts they use, its called &#39;Short Rib Kalbi&#39; always in most Korean restaurants. Too many short ribs!! 

Did you know?
Fresh made Kimchee should stay in 
A. Room temperature
B. Refrigerator 
for certain hours to Ferment it.

If you&#39;re willing to spend a little more for GOOD quality korean bbq, this is the place to go. 

If you are a fan of Korean bulgogi (marinated sirloin bbq) I highly recommend trying their version. It is my personal favorite because of how tender and perfectly marinated it is. You will not be disappointed. If you&#39;re not familiar with how to eat bulgogi, and if you want to try something other than just having it with rice...ask for some romaine lettuce, and use that as a wrap for your bulgogi, with some rice, soybean paste, garlic, and your choice of spice.

It is totally different from bulgogi you can find any other korean restaurants.
less sweet, less salty but still has lots of rich flavor. the sauce is not over powering so you can taste the flavor of  meat. Price is little high compare to all you can eat place but it&#39;s worth of try!
even though my portion is huge,won&#39;t go to all you can eat anymore. 
I&#39;m sick of all you can eat bbq lol
For 4 people we ordered 8 gwang yang bulgogi original style, 1 beef pancake, 3 mil myun.
To some people it can taste really blend so don&#39;t come if you want some strong flavored bulgogi or you can order la style instead gwangyang style.
I love when food is less salty espacially when it comes to korean food. just my thoughts :)

I was IMMEDIATELY turned off by the &#34;Scarlet Letter&#34; on the door -- they have a &#34;C&#34; rating from the health department, which if I hadn&#39;t been planning to go here with friends, I would&#39;ve turned around and gone elsewhere. 

Anyway, the signature meat at Gwang Yang is the Gangnam-style bulgogi. It was good enough that we ordered two portions. We also had pork belly, marinated ribs, flower rib eye, tartare bibimbap, and a beef pancake. I was impressed with the meat and how well it was marinated/seasoned. 

Cons: Portions were quite small, prices were too high for the portions, and the mediocre sides were tricky to divide evenly in a group of 8, leaving something something to be desired. Maybe it&#39;s just because I&#39;ve never experienced KBBQ before, but I kept getting smoke in my eyes and that bothered me. Also, parking was tricky outside and took several trips around the block to find a metered spot (like many young and/or broke people in LA, I&#39;ll be damned if I spend the money on valet). 

Pros: There was no wait, service was excellent and quick (but we were joking that our friend who speaks fluent Korean had something to do with that), and as previously mentioned, the meat was very tasty and excellently cooked -- our waiter asked if we wanted it rare to well and that was nice of him to ask and not assume. It was also really fun to watch the meat get cooked on the open grill in front of us!

However, I&#39;m still not going to give them more than a 3 -- we ended up spending $35 per person and I still wasn&#39;t full. Soooo, I likely won&#39;t head back (that &#34;C&#34; score is enough to make me stay away)."

If they don&#39;t have rice paper, I consider it a immediate fail. This was not one of those occasions, which was surprising to myself as well.
The whole experience was unexpected. I don&#39;t even like bulgogi but this was different.. We had a room and even though we ordered a raw plate of meat, and the meat was cooked at the table cover the workers there did the grilling for the most part.
Gangnam bulgogi 5/5 really thin, not as sweet as the Los Angeles style so they say and when cooked to a char had a nice smokiness and flavor
Bulgogi jungol 3/5 this isn&#39;t my favorite dish to begin with but it tasted just like what you would expect, no overly fatty pieces of beef. The broth was a little too sweet than what I&#39;d prefer but that&#39;s just how it&#39;s supposed to be, not my favorite
Seafood and green onion pancake 5/5 soft and unctuous with seafood that&#39;s not tough and crispy edges with the nutty sweetness of cooked green onion
Kimchi pancake 3/5 was good too but the kimchi was a little too ripe and tasted a little sour in the finished dish
Bibim naeng myun 5/5 the noodles were very chewy and it was spicier than I was used to. Very tasty, our Caucasian guest approved too :)
Raw beef (don&#39;t know the exact name) 5/5 this came out as service and it was surprisingly good! Tasted smoky and the chilled cut of the raw strip of beef had a nice texture almost like beef jerky or like it was so cold that it was almost frozen. Very interesting and a pleasure to taste
The meal was finished with a pumpkin shikhae that was bright yellow and something I&#39;ve never tasted before.. The pumpkin flavor was subtle but added a richness to the usually light rice drink
We shared some kloud beer and Soju and it was a great new experience, even for someone like me that is a seasoned kbbq eater. Everything is done in their own style and everything is very unique, you&#39;ll find yourself pleasantly surprised. I highly recommend this place if you like Korean marinated meat, and even if you don&#39;t!"

They also cook and grill the bbq for you but sometimes they get busy and don&#39;t come for a long Time after putting meats on the grill  so you gotta watch out so the food does not burn, 

 but it is on the  pricey side. In fact I don&#39;t think I have ever  paid this much for Korean  Bbq. There was 3 of us, we paid close to 50 bucks each.

I am not an expert on kbbq  but I don&#39;t think I would come here very often due to its high price. While gwang yang bbq is not a buffet, I know manna bbq is all you can eat and is reasonably priced (like 25 dollar per person and the food bar isn&#39;t too bad compared to others, just tips for people who don&#39;t want to spend a fortune on bbq.

My husband thought the kimchi was the most delicious he had ever had, and he&#39;s made his own! The beef melted in our mouths. But really, there is great food all over Koreatown, what really made this place special was that they go out of their way to make everyone feels like an honored guest and that really made the evening a night to remember.

The restaurant is incredible - the food is one of the best I&#39;ve had in LA, the service was friendly and speedy, and prices were fair.

My chief complaint is the valet service that&#39;s partnered with the restaurant. When you drive into the valet you are offered either $2 or $3 charges with the restaurant&#39;s validation. Sounds like a good deal right? Think again. As I went to pick up my car I saw the attendant sitting inside a car having his dinner. I didn&#39;t think much of it at first and moved on. I proceeded to pay, giving him my credit card. Then he tells me that its cash only - a fact that is not written on any sign or that was told to me upon entering. This obviously bothered me as I had to go upstairs, withdraw cash and pay an ATM fee. Then when I received my car I noticed the seat was out of place, all the windows were open, and the car reeked: not sure whether it was body odor or food. 

The funny thing is that you can self park in the same garage as the valet for $4 and pay with your credit/debit card. Next time I&#39;ll be sure to do that.

Tl;dr: restaurant is wonderful, avoid the valet service at all costs."

We had the $100 Combo which included the Ribeye, Bulgogi, Brisket and Pork Belly.

Let&#39;s start w the side dishes.  Not only they were fresh, they were well seasoned and tasty.  We had 3 rounds of the Korean glass noodles.

You pay what you get!  I enjoyed the high quality meat very much.  They were tender, lean and well marinated.  First, I wondered how the cinnamon dipping sauce could complement with the different types of meat.  Then I realized It really enhanced the flavor of the Charcoal grilled meat and it was pretty incredible!

One of the Best Korean BBQ in town!  Chosun is great but I definitely prefer Gwang Yang!  Great service from Ian!"

The grill is more legit as it&#39;s changed to accommodate for different meats that are ordered. Beware that portions are smaller, which kind of reminds me of Japanese bbq (yakiniku), so don&#39;t come here starving. The banchan (side dishes) are plentiful, but I generally just stick to the kimchi.

It&#39;s pretty spacious inside, although not easy to locate if you&#39;re looking for signage. It is true that English is limited here, so best to bring a Korean friend if you&#39;re feeling adventurous and can stomach the prices. Not much to say since I&#39;ve had better of everything at Soowon Galbi at a similar price point for a la carte meats."

In its place is the newly opened Gwang Yang Korean BBQ (GYKB), a Korean BBQ place that focuses on &#34;bulgogi&#34;, which literally translates into fire beef - bul means fire and gogi means beef. In fact, in Korean the name of the restaurant is literally Gwang Yang-Style Bulgogi House. 

Bulgogi is typically marinated in a sugary soy sauce mixture that contains garlic, sesame oil, and other ingredients. And gwang yang-style bulgogi happens to refer to a method of preparing bulgogi by seasoning the meat just before cooking. 

Now bear in mind that GYKB is not fully opened yet. In fact, they are currently only serving a limited number of items since they are on self-proclaimed &#34;soft-opening status&#34; until September 2014 when they are supposed to &#34;officially open&#34;. 

This means that only a select items are available. When our office went for lunch, we found out that none of the naengmyuns (Korean cold noodles) were available. So, we ended up ordering the yetbuljeon and the yuk-hwoe. The yetbuljeon is a contraction for YETnal BULgogi JEONgol that literally means old-school fire beef in a stew.  

The yetbuljeon consisted of gwang yang-style bulgogi that was served in a table-side steel metal cooking vessel with glass noodles, two types of mushrooms, scallions, and onions in a sugary broth with slices of bulgogi that were few and far between. 

You definitely need rice with the yetbuljeon to counter the sweetness of the bulgogi. All in all, this flagship dish was really good and lives up to the restaurant&#39;s name. The only downside? There is a minimum serving requirement for two people. So while on the menu it says $19.99, the actual price of the dish is $39.98, which in Koreatown AYCE (all you can eat) terms means overpriced. 

The yuk-hwoe is Korean-style steak tartare. The method that GYKB uses is Cholla-do-style (a region in southwest Korea known for its tasty food), so no raw egg is mixed in with the raw beef. Instead, the raw beef is marinated in sesame oil and possibly honey and mixed at the table by your server with julienned Korean pears. 

Overall, this dish was really good and after more than 3 hours, I haven&#39;t had the shits (not so confident about mad cow disease though). Again, the drawback with the yuk-hwoe is that is costs $29.99 for a small platter. 

With two locations in the Gangnam area of Seoul, GYKB seems to know what it is doing. The only problem is that, unlike Korea, there are a ton of AYCE places in Los Angeles, since beef is a lot freaking cheaper here. Therefore, although we dance like horse-riding morons here, Gangnam-style prices do not translate well in Los Angeles. 

Four stars since the food tasted good despite the prices. Crossing my fingers that they read my review and offer Happy Hour prices or lunch specials. 

* GYKB also serves beef to grill on charcoal grills.

* The interior was a bit odd and reminded me of a nightclub or lounge in Las Vegas. Moreover, it was strange that they played jazzy crooner music with The Amazing Spiderman Part 1 playing on the televisions."

We literally go every weekend as a group of 5 people. Quarters, MoedaePo II, Parks.. We&#39;ve been to some of the top Korean bbq&#39;s around town...But this place place tops them all.

First off, our waiter Jerry was extremely attentive and informative. As he&#39;d cook our meats, he&#39;d tell us about how well it should be cooked/what sauces they&#39;re best in, etc. He would take a second to bring anything we asked for and had such a positive attitude even with a really busy environment. 

The food was amazing. Meats are all Kobe--highest quality. Sides could have been better but their Kim chi is sooooo good.

In the beginning they seems attentive and due to high price, I thought they will do the full grill service but no one shows up even meat getting burned...
So I grilled myself however I noticed that this place is actually do full grill services but other tables get same  treat as I had.

Restaurant barely filled 1/3 of tables but all 5-6 servers seemed very busy. I was wondering if place is full how they could manage it... I even had to ask bus boy to bring the check since there&#39;s no one in sight.

I overheard from other table that there&#39;s sikhei (rice sweet cold tea) after meal but no one mentioned and I even asked it to lady on the counter but she said it&#39;s out, I was there at 5pm on Sat. Which dinner barely start but there desert is out that early? She wasn&#39;t even apologize and she wad making a joke to come again to have sikhei next time...why would I go back for free sikhei which I don&#39;t even know the taste. 
It wasn&#39;t even funny because other table right next to us even got mad and left with mad face.

We even ordered 2 bibimbap to add more carbs to our meal - and I feel I&#39;ve had better bibimbap as I like my rice crispy on the edges.

I had been a bit intimidated by some of the Yelp reviews which talked about the restaurant being pricey. We found the prices to be more than reasonable and the portions appropriate in size and outstanding in the quality of the meat. We had 2 chicken and one gangnam style beef bulgogi and one LA style bulgogi, as well as an order of seafood pancakes and enough beer for 5 of us and an iced tea for the other. We preferred the gwang yang bulgogi to the sweeter LA style bulgogi but it may be different for others.

The cost was only $28 per person and included a cold soup and refilled banchan appetizers. This was a bargain for such quality and a great night out. Thank you Gwang Yang for sweet and very attentive service and a magnificent feast."

Sure, they serve Gwang Yang style bulgogi - seasoned thin strips of sirloin beef, grilled over black oak charcoal. Reminds me of the bulgogi marinade that I used to eat in Korea as a child. 3 words - I loved it. But, once the pricey bill came to my table, I asked the waitress to get me a beer so it would ease the shock.

Formerly, the venue was So Hyang Korean Restaurant. What they kept was the clean atmosphere, very modern. They have a few rooms with glass walls, really perfect for an intimate meal with friends. I always liked dining here, but felt that the food was overpriced. I guess the fares haven&#39;t changed, just the name of the business. The meat quality here is excellent, following in the tradition of Chosun Galbee or Park&#39;s BBQ. Catering to the American taste. Red wine included.

Gwang Yang is a town in southwestern Korea. They&#39;re known for their bulgogi (grilled beef), which represents a taste that goes back hundreds of years in Korea, circa the Chosun Dynasty. This restaurant is a part of a 5 store chain in Korea, with this being their first US location. (http://www.gybonga.com/about/) Other than the meat, I&#39;m curious about their Galbi Tang or Mool Nangmyun. Food for thought, literally.

OPPA GANGNAM STYLE
The bulgogi is marinated to order, so the seasoning is not too strong, and the meat has a delicate and flavorful taste, yet lightly smoky. The Gwang Yang style bulgogi comes in two versions - Gangnam Style or LA Style. Yeah, I was laughing when I saw that too. 

Here&#39;s what you won&#39;t be amused about though. $34 per serving. And I mean tiny ass serving too. Like PSY, I ordered the Gangnam Style version, which was supposed to have a less sweeter marinade than it&#39;s LA Style counterpart. I think the LA Style is catered more to the Caucasian taste.

Rating - 3.5 stars
I&#39;d go just for novelty sake. It&#39;s fresh and hip, just like you. Why can&#39;t you enjoy an expensive meal now and then? The place seemed to be doing well for a Friday night, with Korean BBQ still very much alive in K-town. From here, I can see Jjukku Jjukku BBQ across the street. That&#39;s next on my radar. So many KBBQ joints, so little time."

I noticed that So Hyang was gone, and in its place was Gwang Yang. It&#39;s currently their soft opening, so the bf and I decided to try their lunch.

I like trying the naengmyun and galbitang of any traditional Korean BBQ restaurant, which tells you a lot about the quality of the meat and their attention to detail. We were told we would have to wait 10 minutes to be seated, but sat down at a table a few minutes later.  The menu seemed traditional - galbitang, KBBQ, naenmyun, and my favorite, old-style bulgogi.  The prices were expected of a Koreatown restaurant.

I tried the naengmyun and the bf tried the galbitang.  The naengmyun was ice cold and refreshing, served in a gold bowl reminiacent of Okrumong&#39;s gold bowls.  It came out a little sweet, but with vinegar and Korean mustard, it gave it the perfect flavor.  It was $9.99, the price of most naengmyun.  I definitely prefer this naengmyun to other reataurants&#39;.

The galbitang was hot, and came with generous portions of meat. However, I&#39;m used to the meat sliding right off the bone, but the meat took a little bit of maneuvering.  Since it&#39;s the soft opening, it was $9.99. 

The side dishes were pretty okay.  They serve jangjorim with egg, which is pretty rare as a side dish in Koreatown. The spinach with bean paste left a bit of a bitter taste in my mouth, and the kimchi and radish were riper than I expected or like.

All in all, a great first experience. I&#39;m looking forward to coming back and trying the old-style bulgogi and their galbi!

The interior is super clean, and the staff is friendly and attentive. Four stars!

--EDIT--

Um ... the valet guys lost the keys for our car (?!) and laughed about it without really saying much else (except a very not sorry &#34;Sorry&#34;).  I hope management will make sure that the quality of valet will match the quality of their business, especially since it&#39;s still a soft opening."

At Gwang Yang, it&#39;s all about bulgogi - top-notch rib eye, thinly sliced, marinated, then charcoal grilled to tender perfection.

Gwang Yang&#39;s secret lies in their bulgogi marinade - an old family recipe, very secret. The meat is grilled one of two ways: &#34;Gangham-style,&#34; (inspired by the region in Seoul, not Psy) which is traditional, simple and savory, or &#34;LA-style&#34; - sweet and soft, and with a clearly targeted audience.

The space is spotless, vast and versatile. On the floor, middle-aged Korean woman sip bottles of soju and large parties celebrate over barbecued feasts. In the private dining rooms, Korean businessmen type on laptops as expertly as they handle their chopsticks.

Don&#39;t fill up on banchan (Korean small plates) - the dishes are beautiful, unlimited and consistently replenished. Hold out for the Kobe Yukhwoe (kobe-style beef tartar), which will restore your belief in raw meat. The Yook-Jeon (beef pancakes) and Mul Naengmyeon (cold noodles served in a chilled beef broth) are also great, but nothing beats the Dongchimi (chilled kimchi soup), which is unlike anything you&#39;ve ever tasted, and following your stuffing, will absolutely hit the spot."

Gwang Yang is NOT AYCE Korean BBQ. You pay more for the better quality meat, BUT not the quality of service. We made reservations and walked straight to the front and was seated quickly. When you first look around, you see/feel the more modern decor/ambiance. They added this earthy orange wall (complete different from the traditional  So Hyang).  Their booth seats have LED lights on the top borders. They kept the private rooms (from So Hyang) for larger groups. 

Our server greeted us nicely and showed us their promotion. If you download their app you can get free Korean Cold Noodles. We started to look for the app, but it was for ONLY ANDRIOD users. She told us 5 minutes later.. AND everyone person at the table had to download the app. -waste.of.my.time-

  

Now let&#39;s start with the food.
The banchans (side dishes)  they brought out were mediocre. It was my first time going to a korean restaurant without given Kimchi.....yes.. KIMCHI was not given AT ALL *shocking*. 

We started with a bottle of Pinot Noir. She presented and struggled opening the bottle. Then walked away without pouring a glass. 


We are order Korean Cold Noodles (mullnengmyun) and Spicy Korean Cold Noodles (bibimnengmyun).

Again, Mediocre. The Spicy Korean Cold Noodles were not even SPICY.

We are 3 different types of meat: Saeng Galbi, Ggotsal, and Ribeye I will say there&#39;s definitely quality in the meat. You can taste the quality difference from AYCE bbq. (But i&#39;ve been to Kang Ho Dong Baekjang and it&#39;s better over there)

They give you this small salad to accompany it with your meat. We had to ask for refills over 5 times. Why waste both our times and just bring a larger amount?


The last order was the Ribeye. It was placed on the grill and we continued our conversation. Maybe a 1 minute later someone came to flip it and started to cut the meat apart. Let me rephrase that, she TORE it apart.  I was watching her destroy it. Then different servers would come and keep flipping the meat, when it should just grilled longer on each side. I told one of the servers, I think we should just leave the meat alone to let it grill. She just started to laugh and continue to flip the meat. 

BOTTOM LINE
The service was there, but not at the level their trying to present/charge.
The servers need to be more educated in grilling and presenting."

It was 2 of us and we are not big eaters but we had to order 3 portions. Usually 2 is more than enough for us. 
their environment is neat and clean. but nothing special after that.
their complementary small dishes (banchan) is kinda salty especially the noodle and steamed egg.
the meat quality seems to be good but way too small portion. We ordered bulgogi gangnam style which didn&#39;t seem to be marinated at all. 
the yook jeon was below our expectation, too expensive for what it was. it was $30 for some fine meat dipped in egg and fried. 
Even after ordering 3 portions of food, and spending about $150, we were kinda feeling that we need something else."

Friendly, efficient service.

You will find rowdy drunkenness.  After all, it is a Korean BBQ joint.  And I would say, it adds to the authenticity of the experience.  

There are other items offered on the menu beside BBQ.  But they are items that mostly compliment the BBQ (naeng myun for example).

This place is serious about Korean BBQ.  You will most certainly get quality BBQ that taste great, with one of the best services you will find in K-Town LA."

I&#39;ve never been to Gwang Yang before, so it was a nice turn of events when my business partner recommended we dine here after work last week. He had been raving about this place all week and it wasn&#39;t hard to convince me to come out to try it. It&#39;s located in between Wilshire and 6th on Alexandria, right behind the Equitable building. Upon entering the restaurant you see that it is very clean and modern inside. It&#39;s great for business dining in VIP rooms or casual dining in the main dining area. I am used to places like Park&#39;s BBQ, Soowon Galbi, Chosun Galbee, so this was not my first rodeo. After ordering and receiving our dishes, I noticed that every ingredient used to make the dishes were of very high quality. The galbi we ordered was one of the best I&#39;ve ever tried! Another things to note is that I generally don&#39;t like Bulgogi served at restaurants, but their gangnam-style bulgogi was very good and is now something I&#39;d order here regularly!

The real star of the show and the reason I&#39;d come back here would be the yukhoe. Their Korean style Kobe beef steak tartare had a fair amount of sweetness from the julienned Korean pear, tenderness from the cut of meat, and nuttiness from the sesame oil mixed in imparts a one of a kind flavor that is something to experience in your lifetime. I plan to fully exploit this recent discovery by having it every time I go here."

I&#39;m used to bulgogi that&#39;s very cooked (and thus very chewy), not super tender, blastingly sweet, and, well, pedestrian in the way it reminds me of lukewarm school lunches packed by mom and styrofoam plates topped with overcharred grillings from church picnics.  ah, simpler times.

THIS BULGOGI AINT your momma&#39;s bulgogi, and it aint your church picnic&#39;s bulgogi.  

it is shaved thinner than chadolbaegi (korean thin sliced beef brisket, traditionally qualified as the thinnest slice... until NOW), with the blood hue of a garden hibiscus bloom (no browning pear-garlic-sugar bath here, at least not if you order the gangnam style), and the marbling of a ... piece of marble?  (well, you get the point.)

the haemul pajeon (seafood pancake) knocks kohbawoo&#39;s out of the park with its crisp.

you will eat like a municipal king (of Ktown), as the golden bowls they serve retail for $100 each.  (unsolicited information, but happily received nonetheless)

you will also feel like you&#39;re in Seoul.  mainly due to the hyper cleanliness of everything inside the restaurant.

redefining bulgogi, one shaving at a time."

Gwang Yang makes a lot more sense here--it&#39;s a sure bet, a popular restaurant imported from Korea, a model that has worked so far for Baekjeong, BCD, et al. It&#39;s a fancier spot than Sohyang, especially after a seven-figure remodel, and the food is top notch. Gwang Yang is a new alternative to Park&#39;s or Chosun or Madang621, with a bulgogi focus. It&#39;s on the pricey side, but the barbecue is excellent.

I&#39;ve been three times, both for lunch and dinner, and have been very happy with each experience. Gwang Yang is a great large party restaurant--there are private rooms as well as several tables that can accommodate groups--and I&#39;m guessing my family will end up going pretty often. Service is good, friendly and attentive, though specific requests may fall through the cracks here and there. This is understandable, especially with big tables--last time I was here, we must have put in a dozen different orders for beer and soju.

The banchan spread is great, and it&#39;s varied slightly with each visit. There are some larger standbys--steamed egg, Korean pancake, dongchimi, and a simple salad with black sesame dressing, to name a few--as well as the smaller side dishes. I&#39;ve had both an unusually good potato salad and an unusually good braised potato banchan here. Spicy salted squid and spicy salted pollack are also quite tasty.

The main point of Gwang Yang is, of course, the meat, cooked up at the table grills. The signature item is the bulgogi, galbi&#39;s less popular cousin--a thin-cut preparation of marinated beef, charcoal-grilled. You can get your bulgogi L.A. or Gangnam style. Both marinades are lovely, more or less in keeping with what you&#39;d expect from Korean barbecue. The difference is subtle, with a little more sweetness to the L.A. version. The bulgogi cooks up tender and silky, each ribbon pulled off the grill with all its flavor and delicate texture intact. Bulgogi is an inferior cut to galbi at most restaurants, as it curls and overcooks more easily than sturdy short rib--visit Gwang Yang to see bulgogi realize its full potential. It has a velvety, almost slurpable texture that requires very little chew, and each sliver of meat is dense with taste. You should get the galbi, too, though--it&#39;s as good as any you&#39;ll get in town. Unlike most Korean barbecue joints, Gwang Yang is not afraid to serve its beef several minutes short of well done. Your server will tell you when it&#39;s ready to eat.

I&#39;d also recommend some things that don&#39;t go on the grill--in fact, everything else I&#39;ve ordered, as I have yet to eat anything mediocre at this restaurant. One is another iteration of bulgogi, in a Korean sukiyaki-style dish called yetbuljeon (short for &#34;yetnal bulgogi jeongol,&#34; or &#34;bulgogi stew of old&#34;). This is a large format dish. You pay per portion, but there&#39;s a two-serving minimum order (common for jeongols across Koreatown). It&#39;s a soupy preparation of Gwang Yang&#39;s bulgogi, with the sliced meat served in a stew loaded with mushrooms and vegetables. Very warming and flavorful, though the meat does cook up tougher in soup than on the grill. The eundaegu jorim, or spicy braised cod, is another delicious option, this one fairly surprising. Eundaegu jorim is a key dish at places like Soban and Junwon, restaurants that focus on Korean homestyle cooking. Gwang Yang&#39;s version is as good as the best in these non-barbecue restaurants. The cod is flaky and moist, thoroughly shot through with flavor. It comes in a huge portion braised with radish and potato and rice cake and tofu. Get one for the table. You won&#39;t be sorry. For smaller share plates, I like the seafood pancake, which is always a crowd pleaser, packed tight with scallions and nuggets of squid. We were comped an American Kobe yukhwoe on our last visit, and this was excellent, something I&#39;m likely to get again. It&#39;s a fantastic, silky yukhwoe, or Korean steak tartare, tossed in a spicy sauce with some cooling slivers of Asian pear. Finally, Gwang Yang&#39;s naengmyun is pretty good. Not the best in town good, but definitely tasty. You can get a side portion to eat at the end of your meal--mul, bibim, or hwoe. I&#39;d recommend the hwoe for something a little different. It&#39;s essentially a bibim with some chewy cured fish on top. Very pleasant.

All this feasting doesn&#39;t come cheap, but if you&#39;ve ever been to Park&#39;s, you know the drill. Gwang Yang offers excellent food in a fun but elegant environment--it&#39;s a perfect choice for a festive group dinner. I&#39;ve already started thinking of it as a long-term default, and I look forward to my next big bulgogi meal."

I&#39;ve eating at cook your own restaurants before but this was a lot better than most. The service was great and so was the food. My favorite where the marinated short ribs and the brisket. The chicken was also fantastic. I was served by a blonde haired gentleman named Randy. He was friendly and very service oriented. He came back several times to check on us and made our visit perfect. I would surely visit this restaurant again. They have upbeat music playing and the ambience was truly refreshing.

I ordered Tsukemen with pork. What I ended up being served was Tonkotsu ramen. I work at Tonkotsu ramen restaurant so I know when I ordered Tsukemen, not Tonkotsu. I felt bad for them to waste it so I had it to go, but they didn&#39;t even give me a discount or anything for not serving a right food. The server acted like it was my fault. Also, The quality of food somewhat decreased. Now I see why so many people decide to stay with the original Silverlake ramen even though it is always packed.. 

I am so disappointed.  They were great when they first opened.

(The second visit)
I took my girlfriend&#39;s sister to 626 Night Market and stopped by to get their tsukemen again. They changed the way they cut onions. I liked the one I got when I went there for the first time. I also tried Ramen of York with Chicken and it was pretty good. My girlfriend simply loved the broth. 

Even though we went in 30mins before they close, it was really empty and service was way faster. 

Overall, I like their style and tastes. 

(The first visit)
My girlfriend and I stopped by here earlier tonight, a ordinal Friday night on our way back from Pomona to the South Bay. We are a huge fan of Silverlake ramen&#39;s tsukemen(dipping noodle). So we thought we should give them a shot. As soon as we entered, we were seated and a waiter called Chris with a welcoming vibe. 

We already knew what we wanted to get: tsukemen and a salmon poke bowl. The foods were just as good as Silverlake ramen but I found it very funny that it took about 20mins to get our foods. For a ramen restaurant, it was way too slow. I really liked the atmosphere of the store but it can have more improvements. 

I think I still will go back to Silverlake ramen for the same foods. 

I was not sure if they ever add MSG but their complimentary chili paste was bomb!"

The recipe was the same, but the execution of the pork was different. Granted, the chashu was the weaker part of the ramen in Silver Lake, but was a downfall in Highland Park.

The tonkotsu ramen broth is excellent at both places. The fatty and viscous broth was the best part of the bowl. The noodles were also the same with an ideal texture and average flavor. The toppings were the same with green onion, spinach, leaf of dried seaweed, and abundant bean sprouts.

The problem was the pork belly chashu. Both places grill the meat which caused a loss of tenderness, but the uneven slicing of the pork caused additional issues. The thicker end was more difficult to bite through and fat was congealed flabbiness. Ultimately, the chashu was difficult to palate.

The same flabby pork appeared in the pork bun appetizer. The pork bun was better at the other location because this one had a deflated bun with a slimy skin, slimy pork fat, and too much slimy sauce."

Tonkotsu ramen-I ordered with the pork belly and added the egg.  Delicious!  They claim their soup is boiled for 16 hours and throw in there pork broth, soy sauce, green onion, spinach, dried seaweed &amp; bean sprouts.  Exactly what I was looking for.  

My group ordered a few other items (Edamame, gyoza, crispy rice w/spicy tuna), but I didn&#39;t want to waste room.  Okay, okay, I tried bites, but none of it stood out.

With that said, when we heard the same chef opened up a new Ramen spot in Highland Park, we headed there the day we heard the news. 

I&#39;m always amazed at the choice of location. It totally makes sense. Hipsters. Foodies. Ramen. Silverlake, Highland Park- both very cool, hipster areas. I&#39;m amazed in the sense that I feel like Ramen of this quality belongs in a place like Sawtelle or Little Tokyo. I feel like the location gives the ramen more flair in this case. There&#39;s also this reddish hue lighting in the whole restaurant. It&#39;s kinda odd but I guess it works with the theme they&#39;re going for. 

So how does it compare to Silverlake Ramen? Just as good. It definitely has similarities and differences. The main difference would be the broth. Silverlake Ramen&#39;s broth is a tad bit richer and thicker. The broth here is less thick and I would say tastes somewhat healthier, if that makes sense. The noodles are just as good, as well as the toppings. I found the yuzu vinegar and the chili paste a great offering to pair with my ramen. The chili paste has the great toasty chili pepper flavor and the yuzu vinegar is sour but the acidity keeps your mouth watering. 

We also ordered a crab cucumber salad and a spicy tuna bowl. The crab cucumber salad was actually super tasty. The furakake and lemon heightened the cuc/crab salad. I think the crab is just shredded imitation crab but I didn&#39;t care. It still tasted bomb with the cucumbers. The spicy tuna bowl came in a nice portion of spicy tuna, rice, and mixed greens. There was a generous amount of spicy tuna and it&#39;s actually good spicy tuna, not the mushy, shitty kind. 

It is pretty cramped inside, since it&#39;s all bar seating style. I wouldn&#39;t really recommend coming in big groups since it&#39;s probably hard to get sit all together. The front can get really jam packed with people since you pay at the front after your meal is over. With people trying to pay for their meal, people picking up their to gos, and people trying to put their name on the waitlist, it becomes chaotic as hell at the front! 

There&#39;s street parking in front (we got lucky and found a spot right in front) or I believe there&#39;s a lot in the back you can pay for. I recommend going to Scoops down the street for some ice cream after!"

I met up with some friends at ramen of York as a start for our night of debauchery. I went with pork belly (the obvious choice right?) and got some extra noodles on the side.

I was very happy with my meal here. We also had the crispy (something with tuna) appetizer. It was interesting and quite tasty. My girlfriend had the vegetarian ramen and was also very pleased with it. I don&#39;t even think she was able to finish it because it was more substantial than we had anticipated.

It seemed slightly understaffed, it took awhile before they got our order (and it wasn&#39;t even busy). It also took awhile for our food to get to our table, but I don&#39;t mind waiting for good ramen.

I ordered the York Ramen with pork belly. I added black garlic oil, a soft boiled egg, corn, and mushrooms. It was tasty! But if I had to compare to the original Silverlake Ramen, it&#39;s just not as tasty. The broth isn&#39;t quite as deep and flavorful, though still quite delicious. I&#39;ll return to try the other broths sometime soon!"

We were ecstatic that there wasn&#39;t a wait.  Restaurant set up is interesting.  No tables, all counter seating with stools.  Check-in on Yelp and get a free iced green tea!  Strong tea flavor and was refreshing from the dang heat.  York Ramen, $10.50 came with green onions, spinach and bean sprouts.  Of course I had to add an egg for $1.50.  The egg was delicious!  The broth is a mixture of pork and chicken broth.  My first time ever having this and it was quite tasty!  It&#39;s not as creamy as straight pork broth but still very good.  I can&#39;t remember how the chasu was... thus, it probably wasn&#39;t mind blowing.  Staff was really friendly and service was quick.

The ingredients here are ok/good, but the cooking and preparation isn&#39;t as good as Silverlake. 

The chicken portion was too much and it was covered in gristle that floated into my soup (see pic). The egg was good, but the halves were cracked, the bamboo shoots had a few that were tough as wood chips. Overall, it also seemed saltier than the Silverlake outpost. 

Basically, it seemed like a kitchen that was following orders and protocol about how to make the ramen, but didn&#39;t care that much about presentation or quality."

I had the opportunity to grab their tsukemen and although a bit on the sweeter side, I absolutely enjoyed the meal. If the fish stock were to be a bit more prominent, this place would be my go to spot.

Since I am not a pork eater I seek out spots that have chicken broth based ramen bowls. When I read that this place opened up I had to give it a try living so close. My friend met me up and we ordered our respective ramens. I added garlic and an egg to mine. The broth and noodles were amazing. There was so much flavor going on I was blown away. The noodle texture was exactly what I wanted. Soft but a little dense. We also ordered a spicy salmon bowl. I&#39;d skip that and just focus on the ramen. That is their strong suit. The salmon bowl was nothing spectacular. 
This place is long and narrow and only has barstool type seating. I know they will be packed in winter. I really enjoyed my lunch here and can&#39;t wait to go back. It&#39;s nice when ramen places have the chicken option!!!"

I had high expectations I guess because I read a review about how good and creamy their broth was and ignored the rest. 

the ramen was served in a smaller bowl than most ramen places, it was full, a lot of noodles, a glob of spinach on top. 

I had a sip of the broth and it was straight chicken broth and not to mention, the broth wasn&#39;t even hot when served, same with the soft boiled egg that was very cold in the middle, and raw white onions all over the bottom of the bowl. the noodles were overcooked and clumped together and only came with 1 small piece of pork belly, no seaweed. just yuck. 

I&#39;m just straight disappointed and can&#39;t get over it. Lol. I hate being disappointed when it comes to food, I guess that&#39;s the foodie in me.

anyway, not coming back. ramen lovers or not, I HIGHLY don&#39;t recommend it."

Boy, was I disappointed. In the article, it made the noodles sound great, and the soup base even better. Little did I know, it was basically the same as Silverlake Ramen. Once upon a time, Silverlake use to be my favorite ramen shop until recently. The quality has gone downhill as it gained popularity. 
The restaurant itself was very dingy. I didn&#39;t enjoy my entire meal. It smelled like frying oil the entire time. The dish washing station was right at the ramen bar. It was just as big as Silverlake, if not smaller. Everything about it just did not feel clean. 

Just like Silverlake, Ramen of York has extremely tough char sui. Since there is so little on the menu, I kind of expected them to perfect what was actually on it. Much to my disappointment, they didn&#39;t. 
Tsukemen: bleh. Broth was not piping hot. Char sui was disappointingly tough. The broth had a weird kind of flavor. On the menu, it said it should taste like a fish brother, but it didn&#39;t have any fish flavor. It tasted more like a Chinese pickled vegetable. It was also sweet. Is that the idea they&#39;re going for? Other tsukemens I had were savory. Really, the only thing I really enjoyed was the egg. It was perfectly soft boiled. I tip my hat to them for perfecting the egg.
Paitan chicken ramen: odd. Again, the menu says the broth is chicken, but it doesn&#39;t taste anything like chicken. The only thing that made me think of chicken was the consistency. The consistency of it looked like a cold can of Campbell&#39;s chicken noodle. The look of it wasn&#39;t even appetizing. As if the pork for my tsukemen wasn&#39;t bad enough, I tried my friends piece in the paitan, and it was WORSE. He described it as a pork jerky, and I feel like he offended pork jerky. I&#39;ve had jerky that&#39;s easier to chew than this. 
Ice green tea: free for check in. Since I check in everywhere I go anyways, mind as well redeem the check in too, right? Wrong. Some things are better left unredeemed. Like the broth of both noodles, the green tea also had some weird thick consistency. It wasn&#39;t watery. It was almost as if they added some gelatin into their matcha. 

99.9% sure I would never be back here. If I were to come back, I&#39;d probably get the rice bowls, since that&#39;s more of what I noticed people ordering. Food is bleh. Service was meh. Atmosphere was horrific. Smell, taste, and environment was all a bummer for me."

We had about a 5 minute wait. The service was quick. Its all bar seating so its kind of hard to share or try other peoples ramen or rice bowls. I got the tsukemen with pork. My noodles were huge! Well it looked huge because the bean sprouts were mixed into them along with the shreeded green onions. The broth was really tasty and not salty. Some places are salty and its hard to finish. I added some lime juice to my noodles and  I was ready to dip away. The texture of the noodles were prefect nice and chewy the way I like them. The pork was like a thick slab of crispy bacon! It was really good. I only could finish half of my dinner and took the rest of it home. I&#39;ll have to come back and try the rice bowls and other ramens.

The noodles were cooked properly, but I was looking for more heartiness and savory from the broth. I ordered it with pork chashu - nice crispy char taste, but slightly dry. Also, it comes with an excessive amount of green onions, so you may want to ask for it on the side or less of it. Not sure why there are mirrors everywhere, even a few right in your face when eating, maybe it&#39;s to check your teeth for any green onion.

The quality and attention of this  place is horrible.

That was quite disappointing at the beginning,  but it gets really bad as you keep eating,  and you&#39;re just eating all those overcooked noodles.  The broth was pretty good. The pork belly was good.  The egg was a little extra sweet.  The wedge of lime on the bowl was a little odd, but it turned out to be a little bit helpful for the overcooked noodles.
The horchata was too sweet.

Everyone there was very friendly.  I&#39;d go back to try the vegetarian ma pao tofu.

Ramen of York is currently in their soft opening phase at the time of this review. Therefore, service, menu items and experiences are variable until it has its grand opening. Based on personal experience, this small place may get popular quickly and may present problems to those who are unprepared.

The restaurant itself is very condensed. There are two rows of bar-like seating arrangements and small tables (4-6 people) in the very back. Expect there to be a wait time of at least 30 minutes to an hour. This may increase due to future popularity. The same goes for parking. It may be easy now, but once business starts booming, you may have to do some walking.The kitchen is visible, so you&#39;ll be able to see the chefs working on bowls after bowls of food. The atmosphere is quite lovely and I appreciate its resemblance to a Japanese ramen bar. The staff is also very friendly and are currently working really hard to make this business successful, so huge props to them! 

The food itself is very much like Silverlake Ramen except they have a specialty on a chicken-based broth rather than the pork-based Tonkotsu Ramen. I had the Paitan Chicken with Pork Belly, where the broth is lighter and healthier. My girlfriend had the same thing with Chicken. Overall, good quality pork (tender and crispy), chicken (cooked well), veggies and ramen (medium hardness; just right for me). One thing I didn&#39;t get to try (yet) was their drink menu. They definitely had some things I wanted to try; like their horchata, colada and honeydew. If you have the chance, try them out! I also anticipate that they may have alcohol later on? That may not be a concern since there is a bar and liquor store nearby. 

Overall, I love this place. I&#39;m glad that they opened up here in Highland Park so that I don&#39;t have to go to Little Tokyo, Alhambra or Silver Lake to get ramen. It&#39;s food is pretty much just how I see Silverlake&#39;s as well, so I cannot give them too much credit for loving the same thing. However, this is a soft opening and you can expect me to be there for their grand opening with an edited review (maybe)! Hopefully there will be some changes that will make it distinct from its older sister so that it can make a name for itself. Try it out and see for yourself! I definitely think it&#39;s a great place if you&#39;re in the area and/or if you like ramen."

It&#39;s hardy with a nice miso taste without the fish flavor, and comes with plenty of vegetables.

This is my second favorite vegan ramen in the city after Ramen Hood, though this one probably tastes more &#34;authentic.&#34; Waters are refilled quickly, service is quick. What else can I say?

It&#39;s the first ramen joint in Highland Park! The place is small and it gives you the feels of a hole in the wall restaurant. It&#39;s counter seating and stools. The menu is simple and the hot sauce is delicious! 

My bestie and I came in for some late night munchies. She ordered the vegetable broth ramen and added an egg. The vegetable ramen bowl was packed with ramen noodles, tofu, mushroom, saut√©ed cabbage, corn, miso bean sprouts, broccoli and baby leaf. I ordered a small order of their spicy tuna bowl with avocado, quinoa, &amp; mixed greens served with a slice of lemon. The meals were both filling and full of flavor. 

Ramen bowls are huge and perfect for sharing. You can add different spices, meats and veggies to your bowl for $1-2 a topping. There&#39;s also a huge business for takeout if you&#39;re local and looking to try something new! 

The small rice bowls are perfect for a quick bite. They leave you feeling full but not heavy. The spicy tuna was marinated and seasoned perfectly. Most sushi spots go heavy on mayo. I could actually taste the fish. Delish! The spicy tuna bowl paired well with quinoa and avocado. The mixed greens was dressed in a light and refreshing vinaigrette. 

As I looked over their drink menu, I had my eyes on 2. The green tea honeydew and the amazake horchata. With the help of my friendly server, I ordered the green tea honeydew. It was refreshing and gone too soon. The drink is blended honeydew with green tea and cucumber. It was good, but not a fave. I doubt I&#39;d order it again. Will definitely be back to share a ramen bowl, and try other drinks like the amazake horchata!"

The seating is not particularly comfortable, but ok. The part that is annoying is the wait staff, who seems a little flighty and unorganized in general, especially for such a small place, bumps into you repeatedly, as well as a seemingly constant stream of delivery people cramming their way past the tight quarters. Getting past that, the poke bowl is really good. Great flavors very fresh. Same with the meat included in the ramen. Everything else, meh. The cucumber crab salad, came with fake crab. This would be fine if noted adequately on the menu, as I would have simply not ordered. I&#39;ve also found on both visits they were out of several menu items.

I&#39;ll start by saying that their Tsukemen is excellent.  I remember that being true in Silverlake as well.  We also got the Paitan ramen which was VERY creamy, to an impressive level, though I wanted a little more of a kick like vinegar or salt or something to set it over the edge.  

The Cucumber and crab salad was mediocre.  I kind of just wanted a cucumber salad, the crab didn&#39;t do much for me.

I got the Japanese Colada and that wasn&#39;t really that great.  It was really sweet and really sour which both overpowered the coconut and pineapple flavor.

The decor was a little sloppy actually which was surprising to me because it had been closed for a while so I expected some nice work.  I don&#39;t really know why the kitchen was open since all we could see were some big sinks where people were washing dishes.  The cooking was all done further back where we couldn&#39;t see... 

The service was prompt and kind.  The only thing I noticed was there was one guy just focused on pre pouring cups of ice water which I didn&#39;t really see as being that necessary.  It doesn&#39;t take long to pour a cup of water and the ice will melt anyways of it sits there.  That didn&#39;t really affect our experience that much, it&#39;s just me being picky having managed a restaurant before.

Overall it was t fantastic but I would go back for the Tsukemen for sure since I live in the area."

Tight seating (not good for groups), but I haven&#39;t had too much trouble getting a counter spot. Service is quick. Ramen is tasty (I like the yuzu vinegar). 

Not as great as what I had in Tokyo, but tasty enough to keep us coming back when we need a ramen fix. 

I&#39;m no ramen connoisseur or purist, so I sadly cannot comment on the nuances of the ramen itself. All I can say is I like the bite of the noodles (good texture). I like the chicken broth. I was worried this was just a hipster joint with food resembling instant cup ramen, but that is not the case. It&#39;s a place where I can walk in, wait a short while for a seat (in my experience), and enjoy a quick bowl of tasty ramen and then be on my merry way.

P.S. I haven&#39;t tried any of the other dishes (tsukemen, poke bowl, etc.). Will update this review if/when I do."

I liked the interior, especially the bathroom. The music though was too loud, I think it would be ok if the place was full, but during the lunch time there were only a couple of people.
Ordered spicy tuna on crispy rice - was very delicious and the portion was big, and Salmon poke and it was flavorless and pretty dry. As I&#39;ve seen on the picture of the menu someone posted here they had 2 options of poke: small for $6 and big for $9, apparently they don&#39;t have a small one on the menu anymore.
The staff was nice, friendly and quick.  
Might come back but only for Ramen, I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s nice."

You pay for all your toppings even the egg. 2 bowls of tonkotsu ramen with egg and 1 lemonade came out to 30...this place is not worth the price.

Gotta say not too satisfied, the bowl it self looked good, but as I was eating it the fish was getting hot form the really hot rice.. Ita suppose to be more of a fresh fish. It kinda ruined it.. And I&#39;d say if they had a sauce to go with it.. Like spicy mayo that would of made a big difference. Overall there noodles seem to be what they specialize more in.. So I&#39;d recommend the noodles not the poke bowl."

I had the Tsukumen Dipping Noodles which was delicious and full of flavor.  Good ramen has a complex depth to the broth, and this place hit that right on the nose.  The portions are bigger than your typical ramen place, and I ended up regretting my decision to order extra pork belly and egg (but it was so, so good!).  They even went above any beyond to help out my friend who has a broken jaw by giving her extra soft noodles and tofu, so she was able to actually enjoy a meal with us.  I&#39;ll be back to try their other dishes at some point soon!"

Wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the set up and attempting to go through the kitchen to get to the bathroom and was still unable to change the baby. There was only one barstool height high chair so we thought about ordering for take out but miraculously the family using it was finishing up. 

Mushrooms in ramen tasted a bit canned, adding &#34;steamed veggies&#34; is apparently all of the veggies in the add ons but if you order it plus any other veggie, they assume you want extra extra of it. Dumb. Also, the section of drinks isn&#39;t so awesome. Edamame were plain even though they were &#34;lemon.&#34;

Ramen was good, wasn&#39;t brilliant. Servers were nice. Kids were happy. I expected a bit more since it came from Silverlake....better than the closest ramen we already have though."

I&#39;ve had hundreds of bowls of ramen in dozens of restaurants, so I hope my endorsement carries weight. Some may balk at the chicken broth, expecting it not to hold a candle to the savoriness of tonkotsu, but rest assured, the creamy 13 hour paitan chicken broth will satisfy your silky mouthfeel needs, your umami meter will peg, and you will return.

My advice, go chicken all the way with broth and meat and enjoy the healthy alternative to popular pork noodle shops. Add black mushroom oil and the tabletop chili paste for the kick in the pants and grab the amazake horchata. Slurp and enjoy. Welcome to the neighborhood, noodlebowl.

Four stars for my difficult to achieve high noodle standards. Egg was cooked correctly, but seasoning was not to my liking, most likely because I&#39;m used to pork broth marinade preparation, these are probably done in the ajitsuke tamago style of soy, mirin, sake. Everything else was good. Try the rice bowls and substitute quinoa."

Great service, great location, and awesome ramen! Its about time someone opened a Asian restaurant on the York Strip (my apologize if there is already another one)! I&#39;ve never been to the silverlake ramen joint, but visited my fair share of ramen restaurants and little tokyo and sawtelle japantown. This place is just as good, without the drive. Definitely recommend trying it out, and hopefully it sparks more asian restaurants to open on the York/50th strip."

We both ordered the York ramen with pork belly, mine with egg and garlic, hers with black garlic oil and corn. We got the cucumber and crab salad, which was fine, and the colada drinks, which were also fine.

The noodles were overcooked and a little bit mushy. I&#39;d have given this a three-star, but the worst thing about the meal was the black garlic oil that came with her dish. It was nasty--burned and sour-tasting. When we pointed it out (to two different waitpersons), they seemed to think we had never tried it before. They pleasantly explained that it&#39;s made by burning garlic, and that people enjoy the &#34;smoky&#34; flavor. If you don&#39;t know, you can find out in ten minutes of googling that black garlic is not made by burning, and should not taste &#34;smoky.&#34; We have both had black garlic oil before and like it, and this was not it. It seems like this place is mostly capitalizing on the current popularity of ramen, but doesn&#39;t have anyone in the kitchen who&#39;s concerned enough with how to cook to learn how things are actually done. Very disappointing.

One star because the name is awesome and sounds like a Game of Thrones character. But not awesome enough to go back."

I visited last night and was immediately a bit bummed that they did not have a Tonkotsu ramen on the menu.  Instead, they have a creamy chicken broth ramen.  It was tasty but -

Took over 20 minutes to get a waiters attention and they even asked us if we were ready to leave before even getting our food. Who puts a slice of lime in ramen anyways

I am a HUGE fan of Silverlake Ramen and we were so excited for this location as Silverlake has awful parking and a huge wait all the time. 

When we ordered, we immediately noticed  they only have the chicken broth. I&#39;m not a fan of that broth, so it was disappointing. However, I understand they&#39;re probably trying to do something different than the other location. 

I ordered the veggie ramen - it was okay but the broth was too heavy on the vinegar for my liking. My husband got the dipping noodles with came with very little broth so the noodles really stick together and it&#39;s hard to eat. Perhaps it&#39;s better if you eat in rather than take out.

My wife and I get the same combo every time:  the York Ramen for me (creamy goodness) and the dippin&#39; noodles (perfect balance of fish/salt flavor) for my wife.  It is worth noting that this place is a bit cramped (like traditional ramen joints), which can be an issue for families with little kids.  The staff really tries to accommodate families (we always come with our 10-month-old son) which is appreciated, but York Ramen, please, get a couple of more high-chairs!

The day we found a slice of pizza in our noodles, was the day we began to call it &#34;step-dad surprise.&#34; Tonight, excited to try out Ramen of York, I suddenly missed my childhood. 

After walking in and waiting over 15 minutes just to order anything, including water, I felt there was about to be something seriously amiss with this dinner excursion. 

The noodles were mushy. The broth was reminiscent of Campbell&#39;s Chicken Noodle Soup base. They forgot the egg, which if you know how things go, the egg is supposed to be in there earlier enough so that it warms up in the soup. It wasn&#39;t, because it was forgotten. And it was cold, which tells me it&#39;s not stored well.  My friend and I literally ate a couple of bites and decided to just pay and leave. 

Ultimately, we were just really happy that Donut Friend was so close by."

We are so in desperate need of tasty Asian restaurants in Highland Park and I&#39;m HAPPY that good ramen made it&#39;s way here.  

We walked in on a Friday afternoon easily and was seated right away only because I got out of work early due to 4th of July weekend.  I can see this restaurant getting packed because of the small space, but I say try to go during non-peak hours to avoid waiting.  

I&#39;ve been to Silverlake Ramen and Kush and the ramen at Ramen of York is equally delicious.  My husband got the creamy broth and I got the clear broth.  Both was soooo good.  The server also gave us lime wedges to squeeze halfway through....and the lime really added a refreshing taste to the hot broth.  On a whim we also ordered the crab and cucumber salad to share --- loved it.  The dressing was tangy and sweet which is exactly how I like cucumber salads to be.

Their signature ramen is a blessing and true to the Silverlake standard. I have sat in and done take-out without a single hitch. Take them up on the board specials. I had this pork belly bun they have and it is scrumptious. Get four. The spicy tuna bowl was spicy (and I like spice) but it comes like an ice cream scoop of tuna goodness and I could&#39;ve done better with more. The portions are kind. The horchata drink is a must.

Small downside: No alcohol served, something to do with liquor licensing in the building it&#39;s in. Solution: Order ramen to go, and eat it at the Block Party bar across the street, where beer and wine is reasonably priced and take-out is encouraged."

Looks like they changed around their menu, they must have been reading all these yelp reviews! Our second visit here was awesome! Definitely recommend you give it a shot! 

I love the veggie ramen from Silverlake Ramen, the veggie at ramen of York is great as well! Seems fairly similar to me, definitely left me satisfied. My boyfriend ordered the York ramen which had pork and chicken base I believe, he loved it. We also shared the spicy tuna bowl, this bowl topped silverlake ramens bowl. It definitely seemed different from the first time we ordered from Ramen of York. It was bigger and had some lettuce and a delicious dressing. We both left full and super satisfied. 

Pros-
-Close to home
-Minimal wait
-Delicious 
-Quick
-Great service 

Cons
-Weird setup inside- seating is odd, small location and mirrors in front of your face while you eat... Not a huge deal on the scale of things 

I still think silverlake ramen takes the cake, but this place is great as well. I will return again. The negative reviews I think are a tad harsh.. I recommend you check it out!"

We also ordered the rice bowl with chicken because the menu said you could. We where then told that in fact we could not order it since it does not start until the following day. Hey General Manager, did you give that any thought? 

Anywho, as said before the ramen was delicious but the rice was sticky and startchy, not clean at all and the chicken was partially overcooked. Parts of it were moist while other parts were dry as f***.

I requested for the egg on top and it was perfectly cooked. Do not forget to add their hot sauce on your ramen. That red stuff is the bomb!

Place is a bit cramped. Ramen bars should be an eat and go place anyway. You don&#39;t wanna be chatting around when you have a hot bowl of delicious Ramen in front of your face. Slurp it up and go.

It was like a cross between a chowder and a Ramen. Also on this first visit we tried the horchata and it was terrible. Not only was a grainy but it had globs and was unable to pass up the straw. This was right when they open so I&#39;m not sure if this has been addressed. The second time we went we ordered takeout and they did not have the creamy chicken ramen which I loved. So instead they recommended a creamy pork Ramen which is also good. Not sure if the menu is constantly changing.

Food: Had the tsukamen, ramen, chicken rice bowl, and crispy rice with tuna. Tsukamen broth was sweet which is a different but good take on the Japanese dish. Noodles are soft and chewy.

Serving is too big so it requires to bites. Needs to be served into 4&#39;s to create less mess. Ramen was extremely oily. Not a good feeling after the meal was said and done."

Super hipster vibe with a cramped kitchen and not lots of room, but still cozy.  We started with the crispy rice and spicy tuna which was delicious. Probably my favorite dish of the night. I ordered the salmon pok√© bowl and my girlfriend ordered the house ramen with pork.  Presentation here is nicer than Modan, but flavor wise, Modan wins.  The broth here is a little mild if you&#39;re used to pungent ramen taste.  The pork here is delicious tho, very moist and tender.  The pok√© bowl was good, but heavy on the rice and light on protein.  Modan&#39;s bowls are $3 cheaper with much more meat.  Overall it was a good dining experience, just not great. With authentic ramen just a short drive to Alahambra or Little Tokyo, this place is low on the list of good ramen spots. If you&#39;re in the area, Modan is a better tasting and cheaper option."

That feeling dropped a bit when I learned the menu only had chicken broth but after the first slurp of soup, the feeling of having some of the best ramen in highland park sparked back up.

That is the taste and vibe I received-- like for a moment, I was adopted by a Korean ajima and she had demanded me to eat. I went at 11 PM Thursday night, and it was relatively tranquil with the exception to KIIS FM playing in the background. But they even respected my desire for a quiet meal.

I ordered the abalone and rice chowder (congee) and boiled ravioli (korean dumplings - they were shaped like raviolis though). I don&#39;t think the food is five star amazing, but its home-feel is overwhelmingly comforting. I am use to Hong Kong congee, where the rice is boiled until it is creamy and smooth. The chowder was chunky with bits of abalone, the flavor was very subtle. I wasn&#39;t expecting huge chunks of abalone, but the size of the abalone bits are the size of m&amp;ms. I think it would have been better with a stronger flavor profile (like if it was cooked with chicken broth). It was also served out of a casserole dish, which i found a little odd --and of course, you eat with a metal spoon, like a real Korean.

The boiled dumplings weren&#39;t wrapped tightly as traditional korean dumplings nor was the stuffing dense (the dumplings at Olympic Noodle are amazing). The stuffing was pork (probably chicken too) with vermicelli and wood ear fungus (i think) and cabbage. It wasn&#39;t amazing that I would order again. I wished they were steamed. 

The winners of the meal are the banchan that goes with the meal. The Beef boiled in soy sauce is really tender depth. The kim chi and pickled radishes are traditional Korean ban chans are average. (The last one in my photo....was a little sweet). 

I sound a little harsh describing the dishes but I think the chowder is great after a hangover, recovering from a sore throat or during toothaches (like getting your mother----king wisdom tooth taken out). I also see myself coming back after a heartbreak.

Parking was difficult even for 11 PM on a thursday night. I had to circle a few blocks and eventually walked 3-4 blocks before getting to Mountain."

I ordered the fish cake dumpling soup and chicken ginseng soup. Both were great to share between two very hungry people.

The fish cake dumpling was my favorite. It had delicious dumplings and the fish cake had a generous amount in the soup. The chicken soup was so hearty and savory. Probably cause I put a lot of salt hehe. 

The banchan was decent too. They had radish, kimchi, braised beef, and they happily refilled them!

The combination of Korean food dishes makes it incredibly difficult to choose what you want to eat, though the abalone porridge seems to be a popular one around the restaurant.

The service is surprisingly friendly, offering side dishes, drinks, and food with much more hospitality than I&#39;m used to in most Korean restaurants. They&#39;re capable of speaking in both Korean and English (for those who care), and the food is additionally, well, home.

For the longest time I couldn&#39;t understand why people got so hung up on Ktown, but since my mom&#39;s left for Korea, my steady supply of surplus Korean food has been drained and I&#39;m forced to venture out into the pothole-d streets of Los Angeles for some sustenance. Mountain helps me make the most of the situation and is definitely on my list of musts.

We ordered the abalone porridge and bibim-nengmyun - a random craving that tasted as well as I could have hoped. I&#39;ll probably come back and back again to taste everything on the menu, since it&#39;s all a part of my palette, and brings back memories of, well, home. The shiiekhae slush was interesting as well - slush, but natural tasting. It also had the perfect balance of unprocessed sweetness that many Asian desserts tend to have.

Thank you, Mountain. The 24-hr restaurant business has never been more of a blessing. I love how natural everything tastes, and that the menu is nearly perfect. I only wish you were around when I was in college."

We came here late on Saturday night after going to a free Shakespeare play at Griffith Park. It was mostly empty but then 15 minutes after we arrived, it was packed with people. We just wanted a snack given the late hour but ended up devouring our dishes because they were so delicious.

For only $7.80 each, we ordered the #7 (kimchi soup) and #8 (dumpling and rice cake soup). The #8 came with 3 huge handmade mandu dumplings that were absolutely delicious along with rice ovalets soaked in a big comforting bowl of broth. The kimchi soup was smaller (and spicy!) but still offered a lot of food.

As is typical with Korean restaurants, they put four small plates of banchae -- pickled side dishes -- on our table. The kimchi and pickled daikon strips were expected but I was surprised that one of the banchae was very tender pieces of beef brisket. Tasty!

The menus are on the walls, and the signature item here is the $10 abalone rice porridge, item #1 of only about a dozen items. The friend who originally recommended this place told me the porridge also a favorite for curing hangovers(!). Mountain Caf√© is open 24 hours so it&#39;s perfect for just that.

I will definitely be back, hangover or not.

My girl ordered the ginseng chicken soup...she&#39;s feeling a little under the weather and she always felt that the soup made her feel better.  Another reason why we love this place.
Sulungtang came with rice and dipping sauce.  It reminds me of pho except it&#39;s beef in broth with clear noodles.  The dipping sauce taste like ponzu sauce with garlic and peppers and wasabi on the side.  I actually thought the wasabi made the sauce taste even better but don&#39;t add all of it if you don&#39;t eat spicy.  The broth itself is very light in flavor but very heavy garlic based.

Sigh...damned fat fingers, anchored to lazy ham fists...oh, well.

I&#39;ve been a fan for over 20 years of their abalone porridge with  raw egg yolk, and their classic samgyetang, and hope to be for another 20 years, and more...

Thanks for sharing your thoughts.  I&#39;ve removed the last sentence of my original review because I understand that it might come off as ignorant to those who don&#39;t usually follow my reviews.  I often joke about ethnicity and demographics so it was not my intention to insult your customers.  Keep in mind that I am also a customer and I&#39;m Chinese.  With that said, I stand by the rest of my review and I&#39;m going to add the following:  

Your lackluster food, your poor service (reviewed by many at your previous location), and your defensive attitude will not set your restaurant apart from your competition.  It looks like your restaurant regressed and you averaged a 1-star review per every three in 2015.  I am curious why you would single out my review at your new location?  I see that many reviews on your former Yelp page have touched on all the points that I have mentioned in mine.  Therefore, sarcastically apologizing then telling me to scoop out the yolk myself is simply rude.  This explains why your staff has the same attitude.  Don&#39;t let your ego get in the way of your success."

This new location is cleaner, nicer, and bigger with way more seats than the other. I came here for late breakfast and only one other party was here. They seem to have a waitlist when they do get busy. The parking in this plaza... Is pretty crazy. We were lucky to find a space on a Saturday morning. If you can&#39;t find any parking space, might want to park at Zion Market across and buy something to get validated for free parking.

I LOVE their Jun-bok-juk (Abalone chowder) and I have also tried their Kimchi Jjigae which is also very good! Their Banchans (side dishes), especially Jang-jo-rim (Stew meat), pair perfectly with the Jun-bok-juk. Unfortunately, they charge $1.50 for refill on Jang-jo-rim. So i eat every bite of it! 
Here&#39;s a tip: pour over the Jang-jo-rim sauce on your porridge and take each bite with the meat or other side dishes. You also CANNOT miss the pepper in Jang-jo-rim... If you can handle spicy. It is extremely spicy but tastes so good with the plain porridge. I rip apart the pepper and eat small pieces with the porridge. 

Their portions and price are pretty generous and I never had a bad experience here! Their food is also convenient for togo. Service is good, not great. But I don&#39;t mind it for their food haha! Try it if you havent!!!"

Their ginger chicken soup stuffed with rice is also amazing. Also, what Korean restaurant is without side dishes? Mountain cafe offers unlimited kimchee, beef cubes, and more with your meal. This hole in the wall place may not seem like much but you will definitely get the bang for your buck."

Plus it is the best remedy if you&#39;re sick or not feeling too well. Their marinated beef side dish is probably the best I&#39;ve ever had as well.

Parking is really bad at their new location, but if you call in, the waitresses will bring it out to you on Alexandria or 6th Street next to 7-Eleven."

It doesn&#39;t have an extensive menu, which is fine for me. Both the banchan and soup dishes are enough to brighten up my day."

Boyfriend had food poisoning (from another restaurant) during the Memorial Day weekend, so he needed some soft food. I wanted to win Girlfriend of the Year, so I drove all the way to LA for some porridge and chicken soup. 

They hired some new people for their new location, which is a big improvement. They are no longer giving me an attitude when I call for an order. They even gave me extra banchan (gasp!). 

I&#39;ve tried most of the porridge served in Korea town and no one beats Mountain Cafe when it comes to taste. 

So why the 4-star? Because of my experiences at the old location. If I were to move out of the state to start a &#34;new life,&#34; will people&#39;s perspective of me change? Probably not. I hope you get this analogy."

However, that said, it&#39;s definitely made improvements with the move (no longer on 8th)... there&#39;s air conditioning and new tables and MUCH more seating available... and for the drunk college student, it&#39;s 24 hour, so def. a plus for them.   

Some things to caution here:
* For some reason the middle tables are RIGHT under the a/c vent. Beware. I was ridiculously cold.
* It&#39;s usually valet in the plaza and it&#39;s busy/cramped. Other parking options include: CityPlaza parking garage, Derby parking garage, or street parking."

Perfect comfort food, hangover food, &amp; after drinking food. Came in on a Saturday night around 1:30am. There was plenty of seating since we came before the crowds. The menu is on the wall, so don&#39;t expect a table menu. 

Our group ordered the Abalone Porridge, Boiled Cow &amp; Ox Foot, Soybean Paste Stew, &amp; I got the Ginseng Chicken Soup. The Chicken Soup was so good! For the people complaining about it being bland, there&#39;s spicy powder &amp; salt on the table for you to customize your soup. Only had a few bites of the other dishes, but my friends seemed to enjoy it. Wasn&#39;t a big fan of the Boiled Cow &amp; Ox Foot, but that&#39;s just me...the texture grossed me out. Would pass on the Soybean Paste Stew, it was average. Banchan was delicious though! Went well with the porridge. 

Service was really nice and bathroom was clean. Would come back again just for the Chicken Soup :)"

Now...let&#39;s dig into the main content, a 3-star-turned-to-1-star review by Karen C., a certain Yelp Elite 12-16, which I&#39;ve wanted to provide my take at the initial 3-star review but am now convinced to do something about the 1-star review...and to highlight once again some of the, I will say irresponsible and impulsive, reviews here on Yelp (which I felt the brunt of when doing my housing search not too long ago).
1. The customer is not always right, and the key problem here is that the customer often thinks he/she is right when in actuality, he/she is behaving more like a 6 year old kid. Such is the case here, when the reviewer just wants to slap some clearly biased arguments. I applaud the owner for calling out these ill-informed statements.
2. If it was 1 in 3 for a 1-star review on Yelp for the previous location, guess what&#39;s the ratio now...1 in 21, with the only anomaly being you. I applaud (sarcastically) the reviewer for choosing to stay true to her (false) sense of entitlement as a customer. And to add a personal point here, their service has gone up by leaps and bounds since moving to this new location. But then again, let&#39;s note that service is never enough for a 6 year old, unless of course, it is presented in a big bowl of meat.
3. Out of curiosity, I actually went to read some of her reviews, incl. the singled out review of Han Bat Sulungtang. Let&#39;s just say that while the maturity level of some of the reviews is clearly underaged, the experience level is oh yes...yelp elite level.

As a closing point, I want to once again thank Mountain Cafe for serving up amazing, healthy food day after day, and sincerely applaud them for taking a stand against bad yelp reviewers. I also want to say to fellow Yelp reviewers that while we don&#39;t lose (or gain) anything by giving bad (or good) reviews to a business, the popularity of Yelp means the business will certainly be impacted, so be mindful and not let our personal biases or isolated incidents cloud our reviews of these businesses. On that note, 5-star to Mountain Cafe and 1-star to Yelp Elite Karen C....the owner can be right also!"

In terms of the food, it&#39;s not as a good as some of the other places I have gone too. The service I have to say was nice. Both the waiter and waitress were constantly checking to make sure we were okay and refilling our side dishes. Even though the service was nice and all I most likely will not return since the taste of the food wasn&#39;t appealing much to me and the interior it&#39;s pretty plain too.

The owner is so down to earth and made sure I enjoyed my food without the overbearing line of questions. It felt like I was in his kitchen at his house.

The steak was tender and cooked to perfection. The sausage dish was packed full of flavor. 

You have to try the teas/juices made in house. We tried the strawberry tea and watermelon (crazy how sweet the watermelon was without any added sugar) both very refreshing!

Service was impeccable! From the moment we sat down to the moment we walked out the door! I cherish that! Miko (Michael), who I believe owns the joint, was extremely hospitality and checked in on us a few times sprinkling a bit of humor and fun facts about himself (he made up a nickname because his parents didn&#39;t give him one lol and it&#39;s David ).

They also sell Old Bank Honey from a bee hive on a nearby rooftop, which has been thriving for 7 years. As an advocate of bees, support DTLA bees!! 

Best part: as we leave Miko/Michael (sp?) asked if we eat pasta and handed us a bag of freshly made pasta to take home! They make their own pasta in house. What a great way to end the weekend!

As usual, I didn&#39;t know anyone and it was tough for the first couple of weeks. There were the cool kids I always saw from a distance but was always too intimidated to say &#39;hello&#39;. Then one day, a spot opened up at the end of their table in the cafeteria. I moved in quickly, making sure to keep my head down so that no one would suspect anything. Their name is Brunch.

Turns out, they&#39;re totally down to earth and like the same kinds of things that I do! Rap music, good, wholesome food at a fair price, and pasta. All the pasta. I&#39;m so happy I won&#39;t have to eat my lunch in the bathroom anymore!

I had the pleasure of meeting chef and owner, Michael Korchmar, after hours as I was wandering around my apartment complex. He introduced himself and gave me a quick lesson on some pasta he was making for our community event. So friendly. He&#39;s one of those folks lucky enough to be doing what they love for a living. All the more reason to come in for a visit. Good people making awesome food.

The breakfast hash is ALL TIME. Generous cubes of tri tip with a fresh mix of fingerling and sweet potatoes, squash and dill, topped with two eggs. It was the perfect portion for a guy with a big appetite to start the day off satisfied but not full. Can&#39;t wait to come back to try everything else.

Be one of the cool kids. Visit Brunch."

Metered parking is a bit pricey, $5 for an hour and 15 minutes? Booo.  This place is in a random food court that happens to be open on the weekend.  There&#39;s a pizza hut, a coffee place and a juice place.

The menu has a variety of things and has a few Asian infused items like chicken sausage fried rice, vegetable curry and a bi bim bap burrito.  You can&#39;t even get regular iced tea, only green tea.  Also its just pressed coffee so if you want a latte, you gotta go next door. 

I ordered the bi bim bap burrito, my friend got the egg muffin and her husband got the waffle and the steak and egg hash bowl.

The food was generally good, nothing spectacular or mind blowing but very tasty.  My burrito was very filling, probably needed more of that red sauce.

At 10:30am on a Sunday, there was no wait and the food court was practically empty! This place looks and feels like it belongs in somewhere like grand central but hey, I wasn&#39;t complaining! The food was good, maybe not amazing, but good. I got this fried rice brunch dish, and it had a lot of good things like the fresh vegetables and fresh sausage and bean sprouts topped with a beautiful egg but I would say it was a little watery and lacking some flavor. I put in some of their house chilli sauce and was good to go. My hubs got the bimimbap burrito, I had a few bites and the flavor was pretty good. They also had some fresh pressed green juice that was good too! 

Overall, I would come back again. The food court was pretty empty on a weekend and maybe not the best ambiance, but I can see this place being a hit on the weekdays for lunch."

The grilled chicken and crispy rice is SO good. The gochujang, little bit of barbecued char on the meat, the tenderness and juiciness of the chicken, and how the vegetables are cooked perfectly and still crisp is really nice.

I was super afraid of the farro rice and the owner who&#39;s also one of the chefs heard my questions.  After asking me a few questions about my taste preferences and what I normally eat, he suggested I would like farro....AND I DID! The service was amazing. After eating I didn&#39;t feel super full but satisfied. #thegoal I also had the strawberry/banana ice tea and it seemed weird at first but refreshing and worth every dime. I will definitely be back no matter how hard is it to park."

It&#39;s also surprisingly affordable. A meal at BrunchDTLA can run you about as much as a combo at the Subway next door. Think about that. You can have a sliver of processed non-meat on bread-product or an actual meal cooked with love.

I&#39;ve eaten half of the breakfast menu, and a few lunch... 

The egg sandwich with pork is amazing!  

The steak and eggs hash is a bowl of genius, it filled me up for most of the day with yummy, tender steak goodness. 

The bibimbop burrito takes your taste buds to korea! 

The delicious squeezed juices flow with joy.

The waffle is expertly crafted, with a light texture that tickles your tastebuds.

For the price, your not getting better food in dtla! 

BTW, the two girls working the counter are cute as heck! With pretty smiles and great to talk to... I can&#39;t wait to sit there by myself and chat with them, if I was 30 years younger, I&#39;d be asking them out!"

There&#39;s a little market  where Wing Street And pizza Hut is, this is where Brunch and another cafe are, both brand new. Apparently Brunch has been open for two weeks. At first I was hesitant to try it but I gave it a shot. There&#39;s a young girl working there who just literally stands there and doesn&#39;t move and stares at you which kind of makes it uncomfortable. Very unprofessional to just stand there staring at your phone, even if you have no work, keep yourself busy. It was uncomfortable when I was eating too since there are only 3 stools to sit and she was literally standing there next to me the whole time watching me eat. Awkward.  

The food- I got the belgian waffle. If you want syrup or topping it&#39;s another dollar. I thought they had strawberries but they only had oranges so I passed. I also passed on the syrup but she ended up giving me one for free. The waffle was not worth 8 dollars. WAYYYYYY overpriced. It was pretty light yeast waffle with barely any flavor, not huge and not filling at all. Do not order the waffle. 

Service- Again just really bad. There were two people eating before me and then they left so I was alone. The chef/owner comes out to talk to the girl awkwardly standing at the front and I look at them assuming he&#39;s gonna ask how the food is but doesn&#39;t say anything. Apparently the girls sister came by and he&#39;s like give it to her for free. Um wtf. Then these 2 guys walk up and he starts YELLING I cant afford to have late workers it would be cheaper for me not to have any and have my own business  i wouldnt have started this thing in the first place. then was talking shit about customers saying he will not allow any lunch orders before 11 am and to tell them that rudely. and he used a couple F bombs. Not professional with a customer present. Anyway it was weird because he gave them free juices afterwards and they ordered food so Im not sure if they actually work there.

Just very odd. Off putting, uncomfortable rude service, terrible below average overpriced food. Don&#39;t waste your time. Walk right by."

Located in the food court at Santee Court on Los Angeles at 7th.
Delicious, thoughtful menu with something for everyone. 
The breakfast sandwich is mouthwatering, makes me crave it every morning. 
The freshly squeezed lemonade is special beyond, just the perfect sweet/tart balance.
Fresh produce means fresh flavours and everything made from scratch means real food with love &amp; care. 
It&#39;s a hidden gem in the vibing, thriving fashion district right by the flower market. 
There will be a line out the door is my prediction! Cheers to job well done ;)

This is brunch like you have never had before with unique creations that blend traditional breakfast fare with an international twist.  The breakfast burrito is to die for with Korean infused spices, sausage, eggs, veggies and rice.  The sweet potato hash with steak is out of this world there is something amazing about using sweet potatoes in a hash instead of regular ones.  And last but not least their home made cold brew coffee is so yummy you don&#39;t need any cream or sugar. We will be back the next time we are visiting LA!"

What makes this place unique is not only the food and price but the man behind the counter! He&#39;s taking all roles of the place! The cook, the cashier, and I&#39;m assuming the bus boy if it&#39;s a dine in.

Using my yelping research I found Chin&#39;s and drove here to check him out!

The location of his spot is not necessarily the greatest. And when you walk in his restaurant,  don&#39;t feel intimidated that you just landed in a sketchy 1 star restaurant. Yes, he definitely could use a little remodel and scrub down of the place but DONT let that stir you away from ordering take-out at least! 

Chicken Katsu for $6?! In addition, the portions are huge and packed with crunchy delicious goodness. Nothing can beat that price! His containers are bigger than your regular Combo Chinese takeout ones! He also serves soup and other Chinese dishes so I&#39;ll probably take the time to check those out on the future.

If you need a quick fix of delicious food that is cheap and aren&#39;t a scaredy cat of not so nice looking areas, Chin&#39;s got you covered!"

I&#39;m a fan of chicken teriyaki and rice. I had a craving and let yelp give me a recommendation. With so many 5 star reviews, I thought I had lucked up on a hidden gem. No winner on this one.

I placed 2 orders: chicken teriyaki and combo chow mein. Chicken teriyaki was bland and fatty. The macorni salad was more mayo than anything. The beef in the chow mein was very chewy and the noodles thick and glue&#39;ish. I ate a little of both dishes then let my dog to feast on the rest. The food was edible but I wouldn&#39;t eat here in the future.  

For a true reality of this place, I recommend you error to the low starred reviews versus the 5 star reviews."

I am leaving 4 stars vs. 3 because, really is such a good price for what you get that I can&#39;t get tooo strict. I personally didn&#39;t like the ribs because they had a funny odd taste, either from a dirty grill or old meat...
I will stick to just chicken.  The place is not very presentable and dirty, but yet, it&#39;s a &#34;one man shop&#34; I suggest you take the food to go instead, but overall, I am pleased with the food."

Now to the food. It&#39;s pretty phenomenal. For a place that looks like a ghetto Panda Express, I was blown away by the tastiness of his food! The portions are huge as lots of people mentioned, and it is a one man show, but the what he lacks in manpower he makes up for in quality.

We got the black bean noodles, Hawaiian BBQ chicken teriyaki plate and kimchi fried rice (for 2 of us). Way more than enough food and we had a whole dish worth of leftovers and it came out to about $17 total.

The area around the restaurant isn&#39;t great,
in fact it&#39;s pretty sketchy at night, but it&#39;s worth the risk. Try it out. You guys won&#39;t be disappointed."

My friend and I were out searching for a meal at 9pm, but everything close by was closed. This place was opened and we were initially hesitant until we found out it served Hawaiian style BBQ/plate meals.

Don&#39;t judge the joint on the exterior/interior--the food and portions are quality here!

All the meals are on average $6-8 and the portions are HUGE. I always have to split my meal with a friend because its that big and still fills you up. What&#39;s great is that it&#39;s made right when you order, so you know your food is served to you fresh. Normally I get the chicken teriyaki plate, which is delicious. The chicken katsu is also great and is nice and crispy. The spam musubi is a steal for the size--only $1.75 for one! 

Usually it&#39;s just the owner of the place who runs the joint. He&#39;s super nice and easy to talk to and has an interesting history. I asked for additional rice for my friend and me and he gave it to us free of charge!

Definitely check this place out. Just a note--the sign outside does not say &#39;Chin&#39;s Teriyaki BBQ Chicken&#39; but it does say Teriyaki BBQ and some Spanish words. Don&#39;t be confused, that IS Chin&#39;s."

As the other reviewers post, the place is a hole in the wall in a strip mall with several tables.The proprietor/cook was very friendly, a tad too friendly according to my sister (he blew her kisses as we left, lol ).  The chicken katsu was pan-fried as it should be and tasted fine although he forgot to add the katsu sauce (probably too busy looking at my sister as we left). I made do with siracha and soy sauce on the chicken but was disappointed with not having katsu sauce with the chicken. The chicken came on a bed of cabbage along with rice, macaroni salad, and green salad. She enjoyed the shrimp chow mein and could not come close to eat it all... the portions are pretty large.

Even though this restaurant is located in the food court, they lay out big slabs of fish on ice for you to see. The skewers are also freshly made and laid out for you to pick which one you want. 

I had the seafood skewer here, it may not seem like it but it&#39;s a lot of food. It comes with coleslaw and your choice of rice or fries and a bread roll. The rice looks similar to Mexican rice. I opted for the fries and they weren&#39;t very impressive. They were soggy and not crunchy at all. The seafood skewer though, wow! It comes with a large piece of salmon, few shrimps, scallops and a few slices of onions and bell peppers. You can choose either garlic butter on your skewer or Cajun. I had the Cajun and it was delicious.  

I&#39;m not big on seafood and only ate here because a coworker took me here to eat, but I&#39;m glad I got to try it because it was honestly pretty good. They also have a good selection of tacos and fish plates."

I always get the $8 fish plate which comes with a green raisin coleslaw, French fries, large fillet of pan cooked fish (lemon butter or Cajun) and sourdough roll. For a fresh cooked meal you get your food faster here than anywhere else in the food court which is miraculous since the other places are just grilling hamburgers or making sandwiches and salads.

Compared to normal dining it is definitely just food court dining best suited for workers in the area and would probably just be 3.5 stars when comparing to other hipster eateries in surrounding LA.

The manager and staff are also very courteous and professional. I sometimes go with my Chinese coworkers and the manager who seems to be Caucasian or Hispanic always tries his best to pronounce their Chinese last names correctly which most Americans like myself have no idea the difference.

I opted for the fish and chips because you can never go wrong with anything fried. I must say, it was really good! You can tell they made it when you ordered it, none of that heat lamp ish.

Secondly I&#39;d like to add that this strip mall is only opened for 4 hours a day right around lunch time so no breakfast or dinner sorry!

The food here has been amazing they always have a great assortment of fish to choose from! Fish is grilled with your choice of Cajun or lemon butter which I have to say are both great!

The fish is always fresh and well prepared with a customer service staff to match. Salim is about the best you can get in supporting his restaurant and customers. Always willing to help you with a great decision he encourages you to try new items on his menu without being overly pushy. 

One time the customer next to me asked about the clam chowder they have there and he got really excited and ran to the back. Came right back around with the bread bowls that he has come in fresh for the soup and bowl combo. Again, not to pushy but you can really tell he is excited about the food he is serving. This is the kind of excitement I think is really great in an owner.

I normally get the cajun fillet of soul lunch special with rice. Costs about $7 AND you get a refillable drink to go with it. I have had the lemon butter and the curry versions and they are all very good, I just happen to like the cajun a bit more.

Fish is cooked up right in front of you and all of the fresh selections are presented right there as you order. It is an impressive setup and always makes me feel as if I am getting my fish as fresh as possible. After you order you get a remote buzzer pager so you can go find your seat rather than standing around and waiting for you food. It makes me feel confident in my decision to eat here when they seem to have the system down pat. Extremely organized, very helpful staff and fresh, great tasting fish to match. The combination can&#39;t be beat!

Love this place, I aspire and would be proud to be duke."

So why am I giving them 3 stars? Because the owner has no problem selling you french fries that were left over from the day before.  This happens to me every time I go there before noon. When I told him about the fries,  he did replace them and did not question the fact that they were old.  He knew they were from the day before. It makes me wonder what other things he may be doing to save a buck.  Please stop screwing over your early customers.  Service with a smile means nothing when you decide to serve us old refried frys.

I&#39;ve been eating here since 2012, when I started working in Commerce. Fish-O-Licious is located in the food court that services employees of this area. Fish-O-Licious is easy to spot out cause it&#39;s usually the place with the longest line. The fish is very fresh and you can see it laid out on ice. You can go fattening with their fried plate or healthy with their grilled sole with a side of fresh veggies. My fave is the curried sole. The sauce is such a treasure and you get a great amount with a side of rice and coleslaw. Its a family run business and the owner is very present and shows appreciation for the many customers that continue to patronize his establishment. Nice people and great food is a winning combination and the reason why I will continue to come back. Also, they have franchise opportunities.

I remember the fish tacos; yes..,the salmon kabobs and other fucking sea creatures &#34;they&#34; decided to put on a god-damn stick (you can keep the stick) fondly. Try the tarter sauce(relish and mayo) too, for the full fish(ish) experience. The coleslaw, which I learned was invented by a wizard from the Mediterranian Sea (ya right &amp; spell chk; leave me alone) was delish. I really recommend that Fisholicious. All i can eat there now is bread and coleslaw, (which makes me feel ridiculous when I order) but if you eat fishes, you should try it out.

I&#39;ve only tried one thing off the menu, but it satisfies my fish craving every single time.  Cajun cooked salmon with rice and zucchini. Comes with a dinner roll, tartar sauce, and a drink if you are so inclined.

After the &#34;buzzer&#34; has totally shocked my senses (which it really does every single time), I go and pick up my order from the nice man standing behind the counter, ready to dig in to a meal that is oh so yummy.

They do have other varieties of fish, cooked in a few different ways as well, the above is just my favorite.

Look no further! Fish-O-Licious is your bastion of hope, water in the desert, your RocknRolla of fried fish... okay enough of that! Getting back to the review, I&#39;m not sure how fresh the fish, but you can see them getting your fish from a refrigerated display case just like you were at a fish market. 

My co-workers and I tried the Cat-fish, fish tacos, and the Cajun style filet of sole. The taste and portions were big. The Cat-fish was covered in crunchy beer batter that had a really good taste and wasn&#39;t overly dripping oil. The fish tacos were huge! And for the Cajun style sole, let&#39;s just say my buddy killed it in five minutes hehehe. 

Ah, the general info, almost forgot, you have two choices; you can have your fish fried or charbroiled. Items from the fryer are served with fries and cole slaw. From the broiler, your fish can be topped with lemon butter sauce or Cajun style with a choice of rice or fries. So, fellow yelpers, when you&#39;re done shopping at the Citadel and hungry for fish, check out Fish-O, you&#39;ll definitely come out feeling satisfied and full."

I got one grilled fish, one battered, just to have a lil sampler plate. The grilled fish is really really good! I was surprised, because sometimes grilled fish just doesn&#39;t do it for me, but the fish is very flavorful and fresh tasting. I also liked the red hot sauce that came with them. The battered fish, however, wasn&#39;t as good as I hoped - a little bit too crunchy and dry and less savory than the juicy grilled fish, so I recommend the grilled fish tacos if you&#39;re going to have one over the other.

I took a friend here that doesn&#39;t even like fish and she got into it. You can&#39;t beat the lunch special with drink included.

First time here for Colombian food
. 

Cheese bread is a thumbs up

Empanadas and YUKA? Appetizers --- fried, good but the YUKA could use more seasoning and flavor with the meat inside. It&#39;s almost like a potato ball!!! 

And garlic chicken entree was okay. It&#39;s not bad but it was something I could make but that&#39;s what makes this spot authentic and honey ,but I&#39;m glad it was clean and pretty healthy. I like the beans and rice it came whiz the rice had a good flavor to it. 

Shrimp was so fresh and good as well. 

The flan the man offered was so kind. The flan was really good! Flavor is on point . I really appreciate you ! To the guy if you are reading this .:) 

In conclusion, I think think service again is great. As far as the food, maybe would go for the popular and well known dishes which I&#39;m sure should be great ."

I ordered the Ave Maria Pues, a dish described by the menu as follows: &#34;a large plate steak served with rice, plantains, sausage, arepa and pork crackling&#34;. I should note that the dish also included beans, and a small portion of avocado and tomato.

The food proved quite appetizing, and I feel that the $20.95 price tag was very fair, considering the massive portion size. This dish could easily feed 2 people, if they were anything less than starving.

By and large, the service here was excellent. The staff was very attentive to removing empty plates from our table, as well as refilling our water glasses. Our primary server (might&#39;ve been the owner) seemed sincerely interested in ensuring our satisfaction.

The parking lot is not very large, but we were able to score a vacant spot. The restroom was ... clean enough.

I will definitely returning here many times, and I encourage everyone to give this place a try."

My family and I have dinner here on occasion. The staff is friendly and the food is great.
Fast service when it comes to the meal being served. Drinks filled in a timely manner.

The only gripe I had was that the staff does not disclose that the tip is incorporated within the bill. The bill is handwritten, not register generated. It&#39;s in Spanish and does not read &#34;TIP&#34; or &#34;PROPINA&#34; (Spanish for tip) next to the amount.
Therefore, I double tipped them on the first 2 times we ate there. Not cool. But once I inquired and I was aware, did not happen again.

I mean we have homemade Colombian food with his family all the time, but Colombian restaurants are pretty rare.

So this restaurant is in Hollywood and his family has been going here for many years...this was his grandpa&#39;s favorite restaurant...and I finally got to try it :)

The restaurant is pretty small and cramped but it was full of happy customers and very clean. It&#39;s like eating in somebody&#39;s house at a party. It has a very homey feel to it.

The servers were very friendly and M&#39;s family were speaking Spanish with the servers which made the experience more authentic.  (Menu comes in Spanish and English versions) 

Anyways...we ordered appetizers: Bunuelos (balls with cheese---pretty good) and pan de bono (it&#39;s like flat bread with cassava/yuca inside) which I really enjoyed. I could use on right now. And we also got a bunch of empanadas (chicken and beef) I preferred the chicken empanadas...they give you a green salsa type stuff that you eat with the empanadas to make them more delicious.

After enjoying the appetizers...we finally decided on the food. Oh btw...you have to get Colombiana (soda) with your food! So good!

I decided to order Mojarra Frita with rice, beans, and fried plantains (about $16)...This is a whole fried fish (Tilapia)--yes, head, tail, and all the good stuff. I love me some fried tilapia! The fried plantains were the sweet ripe ones (I forgot what they are called) but they are so sweet and yummy.

M ordered Pollo Ajorillo or something like that (Garlic Chicken) it was very flavorful as well. 

Everything was delicious and comes in big portions. I was stuffed at the end but I definitely finished my fish :)

His cousin ordered a mini dessert snack called Ariquipito. It was pretty much a little container filled with caramel sauce. I had to get my own for later...It&#39;s so creamy and sweet! Satisfied my sweet tooth on the drive back home.

Can&#39;t wait to come back here and try bandeja paisa!"

There is a private parking lot in the back with a guy who helps with parking but not a valet either. 

We ordered the beef and chicken empanadas which were super good. I personally enjoyed the chicken empanadas more than the beef. We also ordered the yuca fries which were also delicious. A lot better than the San Francisco one. 

For the main dish I ordered the grilled chicken (look at picture) I forgot the name as it was in Spanish. It comes with a plate of beans, avocado, fried banana, rice and one yuca fry. Gosh it was so gooooood!

We sit down and wait, 5 minutes pass, no menus, no water. A waiter passes next to us to serve water to the table ahead of us, he makes eye contact with us and DOES NOT SAY A WORD. I DONT THINK ITS NECESARY FOR US AS GUESTS/CUSTOMERS TO ASK TO ASK THAT WE NEED MENUS. 10 minutes pass the waiter passes by again and NOT ONE WORD, it wasn&#39;t even that busy for us to not get anything. We look at the waitress and she&#39;s only helping the family. We decided if 15 minutes pass we&#39;re leaving. Again the waiter makes eye contact and doesn&#39;t say a word, doesn&#39;t even bother asking us if we need help or would like water. 17 minutes passed and we left.

So finally I decided to go in and give this place a try. Let me tell you, I&#39;m so angry at myself for not coming in sooner!!!! The food is AMAZING! 

I ordered the Bandeja Paisa and so did the person I was with. The plate comes with Flank Steak, Rice, Beans, Fried Pork Skin, Arepa, Plaintains, and Avocado. Everything was absolutely delicious! I left that plate clean! I even ate the beans and I hate whole beans but these were so yummy! 

I drank a Jugo de Maracuya and that was the only thing that I didn&#39;t like because it was very sour, usually it&#39;s sweetened a little bit. We also ordered Empanadas de Pollo y Carne and they were delicious as well especially with the Salsa they bring to your table! Perfection

Just didn&#39;t blow my mind. Our waiter looked tired and had no energy. How are people like that even hired? Anyway, bf and I split the Ave Maria Pues and shared a guanabana en leche. Beans were okay. Arepa I was not a fan of. It tastes like cardboard and masa put together then bleached. Chicharron was amazing. Rice was okay. Meat was okay. Chorizo...ehhhh. Also ordered papas criollas and was disappointed. They&#39;re over salted and tasted like a bland sweet potato on the inside. Portions are big but honestly everything is not as tasty as people blow it up to be...sorry :("

They actually offer a vegetarian plate like they do for meat eaters. Very tasty food and no meat. The portion is plenty and you will feel stuffed once you finish. 
The staff attends to you in a nice, respectable manner. They even have topical Colombian music playing in the background that is not loud so it&#39;s good enough to enjoy and still have a conversation.
The parking is a little limited but free. So get there early or non-peak hours to park freely."

I ordered Mondongo and the dish was mostly potatoes and other vegetables. You could easily count the few pieces of Mondongo on the plate and not very tasty either.

Ambience: very comfortable. This is a hidden gem.

Chose to have one of their three dinner specials.  Had a huge bowl of creamy shrimp/fish soup, a typical Columbian sancocho with potatoes, yucca.  On the side it came with rice, avocado and an arepa.  It was delicious.  I ate a ridiculous amount of food and was stuffed.  It was just so darn good.

For dessert I had figs with dulce de leche.  It was a rich and decadent dessert which I loved.  I had a wonderful passion fruit juice drink to wash everything down.

The restaurant is spic and span. The service is also amazing which you don&#39;t generally get at most Spanish restaurants. Most importantly, there&#39;s parking.

My all time favorite plate is the Arroz Con Pollo served with Yucca, Platano, Potato, and an Arepa (Colombian Tortilla). This rice was cooked to perfection. It wasn&#39;t dry nor moist. Make sure to try all the side dishes such as Pastelle de Yucca (stuffed beef in a Cassava and Arequipe which is similar to dulce de leche)

Started off with a bunello- a corn flour based cheese bread. Delicious and warm, great way to start off the meal. 

The beef empanada was also flavorful, esp with the aji side they serve you. The aji is a mixure of chopped cilantro and chili. Not too spicy but accompanies all the dishes well. I would love to have a jar of this at home.

Being that it was my first time, I ordered one of their combination plates called La Bandaja Paiso, which included rice, steak, chicharrones, frijoles, an avocado slice, all topped with a fried egg.

The beans were more on the sweet side and it tasted great when you mixed it with the rice. 

The steak was tender and juicy. Thin sliced and not tough.

The chicharone was cubed with the skin attached. It&#39;s different than Filipino or Mexican chicharone as the skin was not fried to a crisp. It stayed a bit more rubbery in which I left it alone and ate the meat instead.

The arepas, was described to me as a &#34;Colomibian mochi.&#34; Haha, I appreciated that being an Asian, because I understood better.

The fried egg was a great compliment to everything as it added more of a creamy texture. and shoot, who doesn&#39;t like a fried egg? hahaha

great first time and i am looking forward to my next. i would love to try the soups next!"

The inside is clean and setup where its open and inviting with good light in the day and nothing hiding or busy or conjested...Always a good thing.

Patacon was great! The plantane smushed and then fried to a crisp. It came with green onions and tomatoes that were sauted or cooked a bit. There was also a spicier raw version with a citrus flavor which was also very good. It was much like a topping or dip.

I also had the veggie plate. It came with red beans, rice, 2 differnt types of potatoes a bit crisp, with yuca potaoto/shoots with a light fry crispy finish. It was my favorite! On top of all this was a nicely fried egg with a soft yolk core!  

This also came with the a non-toasted version of the arepa. It was a small squished ball vs the flat toasted one.

I did have the arepa/queso with butter and white cheese, and avocado...then the scrambled eggs came!!! WOW, this was also really nice. It was odd for lunch, but...Why not! (This came with a hot chocolate)!. This I think for lunch was way overkill...as the last thing I wanted was something hot. It was really tasty, but even so, it was heavy going down in the day...I wish he recommended me another drink instead of the hot chocolate.

....I can see this being great first thing in the morning. I was surprised of the nice flavors in the eggs. They might have been the same onions and tomatoes with some very mild pepper? It maybe the dish called &#34;Desayuno Bogotano&#34;

I also tried a drink that was from a fruit that I know from a long time. I forgot the name, but the fruit is green skin with white core inside, soft when ripe, and has large seeds. the skin shape is geometric, almost like pineapple, but smooth green. Message me if you know the name.  I thought I wouldn&#39;t like it at first, but I tried it, and I LIKED it a lot!
I will order it next time as I just had a taste.

OK, this was way to much food for 2 people, so we had to stop! But I wanted to try the coffee. This was a miss. maybe being later in the day the machine was already sitting or something. It needed a nice Urinex cleaning, and a fresh coffee batch. I love coffee, and Colombian is some of the best! So I hope they can adjust that for my next visit.

The reason I give it 5 stars is because I found the food very well prepared, and hard to come by this style of food in the area. It is not a flavor complex food, but if you compare it to classic American food, it IS! But vs Indian, or Thai, Malasian, those foods have so much spices going on in one dish. This can sometimes mask the ingredient. BUT, this food takes time and care to make right with milder flavors that dont mask the ingredients.. 

The above I say with much reservation as I didn&#39;t order any meats or chicken , even fish dishes. They may very well be more complex or maybe even spicy(?). 
So I will next time  try the fish...but surely the Patacon, arepa and yuca with eggs!...OK, I have to bring a few people with me next time.

The service was very good. They were attentive and timely. Cordial and accommodating. The prices were fair and had options for smaller tasting appetizers.

I do recommend them to dig deep in the Colombian or neighbors recipes to find some Empanadas made with no meat. This can be a game changer and open other doors.

If your in the area, and you have not had Colombian food, which can also be like Venezuelan food, I recommend you eat hear. You will get a taste of the culture while you have the tasty food."

We ordered 7 empanadas (appetizers) $10.50, 2 cokes and 3 colombianas, ( a colombian soda) about $11.00, 1 tamal $9.00 or $10, 1 bandeja paisa almost $16,and 1 carne desmechada $13. Our bill came to $66.28, perfectly fine. Close to $60 plus tax, $66 something. When they ran our credit card, they charged us an additional $10 dollars. I checked the credit card receipt I was suppose to sign and it did not make sense. I did not remember the total being $76. So I went up to the cashier, or the man that happened to be there, and asked to see my bill again since I did not remember what my total was. He shows me the bill and it said $76, to which I mentioned I had not seen the bottom of the check that said $76, I had only seen the top part that said $66. I went back to the table and told my husband. It still did not make sense, $66 was the total he had seen as well, we did not see it being $76 so started doing the math. So I went back to the cashier to see my check again, but this time I paid close attention to it. I noticed the additional charge, $9 something at the bottom was added after they brought us the check. I asked what it was since it had no description next to it. The man said it was the gratuity. Perfectly fine by me, but what triggered me was the fact that they added the gratuity AFTER we provided the credit card. Never had I seen this before. Everywhere I go, if it&#39;s more than a certain amount of people they add gratuity and let me know about it when they drop off the check. So back to my experience, if I had not paid close attention and asked about the extra charge, the server would have received a $25 dollar tip (the gratuity that was included plus what I was going to leave, another $15 dollars) for not a very good service. The food was great, but this little incident made me think they just take advantage and don&#39;t say a word."

To start the restaurant is clean, nicely decorated and the service was exceptional. We order empanadas de carne, they were delicious, never tasted better empanadas and am a Colombian food fanatic ;-)

We order a bandeja paisa, churrasco and a soup for my son(sancocho). When the food was served, I got full just by looking at it. The churrasco was served on a cutting board, and rice, beans, potatoes, plantains, and yuca were served appart. The steak was cooked perfectly just the way I like it!!    The bandeja paisa was huge, my dad who ordered this dish was happy and he enjoyed every bite. My son finished the soup and he is really picky on soups, but this one was great, it tasted delicious. I also ordered a Curuba juice. (Taxo) for all the Ecuadorians like me. This fruit is hard to find in the market, so I enjoyed drinking it after so many years.

The waitress and waiter were very pleasant,  polite and gave us the best service.

This one closes at 8:45pm on weekdays but they let us stay till 9 when we digested and talked for a bit.

We started off with the cheese bread, or pandebono, which I thought was alright. The empanadas only came with meat stuffing and my buddy who spent a good chunk of his time in Colombia said that legit empanadas come with different fillings like meat and potato, chicken, pork, etc. The fried ones here tasted like mini tacos mostly because of the shell. The aji sauce is also a bit different from the other place we went to in that this was more watery.

We also had fried little yellow potatoes, which are really hard to find here and everyone agreed that it was the perfect hangover food. It was a crispy outer layer that hid a piping hot soft potato inside. Yum! It was everyone&#39;s favorite! My friends also had the oxtail soup, which looked very comforting, but I didn&#39;t try some, but the ingredients looked very fresh and wholesome.

The pork tamal was ordered was pretty good. The bone was so soft that you could actually eat it. I&#39;m not talking cartilage here-- I&#39;m talking ACTUAL bone that you usually throw out. But this was just impressively soft, which meant they spent a lot of hours on this.

The bandeja pesa here was alright. The chicharron was a bit tough, but the steak was well-marinated. I don&#39;t usually like beans but the ones in this dish were so good that I kept eating them. Apparently everyone didn&#39;t want to eat that much beans or touch them because they were all afraid of being gassy on the way home and afterwards. The plantains were made really well! It had a bit of crunch on the tip and soft everywhere else and still had a nice sweetness to it. 

Overall, we enjoyed it here since the waiter was super nice and kept checking on us (almost to an uncomfortable level to a certain point, but maybe because they were closing soon and he wanted to make sure we had everything), but we have a favorite Colombian place for a reason."

I had what we colombians call an &#34;ajiaco&#34; and it was totally different since it was really watered down. So i asked one of the owners who also servers there, why was the ajiaco so different and he answered me in a VERY RUDE way.
Also the prices are way up, comparing to some other colombian restaurants around the area who have way better food. For example, I payed US 14.00 for this plate when at the other restaurants i had payed US9.00 Which are totally worth it.

Now what stood out here is its Chinese/American diner. I&#39;d take rice over any other carb for breakfast and this was the best spot to go to! To start off, parking is a bit of a pain. If you&#39;re fortunate to find a meter, it won&#39;t cost you as much as your meal. Otherwise, all the lots in LA are charging $10+ so plan it out if you&#39;re spending the day in DTLA.

Choice of breakfast was the hash &amp; eggs + steak &amp; eggs. Comes w/ 2 eggs, toast and your choice of fried rice or pancake. Both entrees were reasonably priced and delicious! I don&#39;t know where you can grab a solid steak &amp; eggs for under $12. Alone it was great, but the option of sriracha made it that much better!  Portions wise this place will fill you up pretty good. I looked at the other breakfast options and chicken wings, eggs and fried rice may be my next choice of entree. 

This place got pretty packed/busy but the service was great and everyone was very friendly. Also, it&#39;s only open till 3pm. Total bummer cause I&#39;d definitely make this my to-go spot before/after visiting Staples Center"

The spicy pork chops were tasty. They weren&#39;t that spicy, just a nice small kick. The fried rice isn&#39;t really all that special. I think it&#39;s just rice stir fried with soy sauce or something. To me, it didn&#39;t really taste like anything.  The home fries are more like sliced potatoes (maybe stir-fried?). I like them. They&#39;re soft and a nice option in replacement for rice. I feel like it just works.

Anyways... I got the spicy pork chop with fried rice, uncle Johns steak and eggs with fried rice. I was very excited for the food. When we go our food the steak was paper thin rice looked dried. I was already disappointed. The steak was super salty, and rubbery. Spicy pork chop was good just a tad flavor less. Fried rice was terrible. I took two bites and threw it away.

Maybe more like Uncle John Wang Lei?  Has a ring to it and more perfectly indicates the cuisine.

Actually, I think it is a real stretch to even call this place &#34;Chinese&#34;.  

The Spicy Pork Chop (one of their &#34;top sellers&#34;) and the &#34;fried rice&#34; (dry, brownish colored rice) were both disappointingly bland.  While floured and quick fried to remain tender inside, the chop pieces (bone in) I had envisioned to be something similar to a spicy Salt &amp; Pepper Pork Chop.  Chinese-wise, it really missed the junk...er...boat.  The rice lacked any character whatsoever.

However, the on the All-American side, almost everything about the Uncle John (primal cut, an uneven, hand cut) Steak and Eggs excelled.   It seems everyone surrounding us had ordered this.  Unfortunately each steak was, well, unpredictable size-wise.  They were thinly cut, but mine was still pink inside, it defined tender and tasty.  You know how restaurants place a picture of a cute little red chile on the menu to warn you of a spicy dish?  Well, this one might have had a picture of toothless gums instead.  My primary complaint, it was very close to being too salty (me who puts salt on everything).  The waitress asked if it was OK to serve with chile and garlic, (of course!) but actually it was insignificant.  Me, I loved it anyway.  The eggs were scrambled to a nice, easy soft texture. And btw,  say yes (!) to the pan fried potatoes instead of rice. 

Timing for a Saturday?  At 10:30 am, tables were still available.  By 11 am there were folks lingering inside and spilling out onto the sidewalk, with the usual anarchy as to who should get the next table (see the other reviews).  I am guessing, pushy probably wins.

More problems?  Yes, but for the most part, relatively minor:
   
**Our entrees came out at different times, maybe 5 minutes apart.

**Typical for DTLA, zilch parking except for a parking lot next door for a flat fee of $9.  Ooof.

**The only bathrooms are next door inside an aging but cool hotel. You need a pass key to use it.

**Echo-y, loud inside.  Huh, whut, say it again?  High ceilings, wooden floors, hollow, nothing to absorb the loud chatter and bangs from the hustle and bustle.  Guessing again, but starting with older Chinese women with heavy accents, it would not be surprising if you ordered over the phone and they got it wrong.  

Regardless, keep your chin up, bucko!  This is a rather fun place for a genuine DTLA experience.    Just not sure if I would drive 50 miles to do it again, though."

The food itself isn&#39;t exactly mind blowing-ly amazing. In all honesty, I was actually a bit disappointed because the size of the steak served in their video was most definitely bigger. The soy sauce seasoning to the steak gives it a subtle Asian flare and the food is definitely a great great deal for the price you&#39;re paying. Especially so because you&#39;re getting two eggs, toast, and a hearty serving of fried rice with that steak. Would I ever come again? Possibly...but not for that ordinary steak.

It&#39;s definitely cool to see the american sauces paired with the Asian sauces. It brought forth a profound feeling of pride for my Asian American heritage. I&#39;ll have to give the other steak places a try."

I ordered the chasu (BBQ pork) omelet which is served with your choice of fried rice or fries. I was hoping to try something different, so this combination sounded delicious.

 This place definitely lives up to the hype of their steak and for the portions prices are great. It is very noisy inside, waiters are back and forth, I only waited five minutes to be seated. Can&#39;t imagine when it&#39;s full!"

The food is bomb, the service is friendly, fast and efficient. I got the spicy pork chop with home fries and comes with toast. I like their home fries. They aren&#39;t those overly fried square bits of potatoes other places call home fries. They are lightly griddled slices of potato heaven. I added cheese for a dollar more.

The pork chops aren&#39;t really spicy, they are just covered with cut chilies. They can easily be picked off if you are scared of the heat.

The portions are large but not crazy. And I got that all for $11.75. $10.75 for the breakfast + $1 for cheese.

Do it!!! They also serve lunch."

I figured might as well stop by and give it a try since we live on the east coast. We came for lunch around 1230ish so I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s busy for downtown LA during lunch on a weekday. We got seated right away. Ordered within 5 mins because I wanted to browse the menu. My boyfriend order the steak they were talking about on Buzzfeed. It was perfectly cooked. Well, to our taste anyways. It was perfectly pink enough without hearing it moo. I got the spicy wings. It was bomb! The skin was so crispy! They do have a bathroom, but you have to ask them for a key because it&#39;s inside a building they&#39;re connected to. So overall: wait staff was good, food was good, price was good. The only thing that sucks is having to find parking or paying for parking. But it&#39;s LA so I guess it&#39;s normal."

It&#39;s such a simple concept--pair Chinese cuisine with traditional American breakfast fare (they also have standard Chinese lunch options), but it just works so well.

Both times I&#39;ve come here I&#39;ve gotten some form of the pork chops with eggs. I recommend going spicy, though the way they add spice is by putting jalapenos on top of your pork, so you have a be a little proactive about making your own experience spicy. The pork can be a little dry and sparsely seasoned (not salty enough) at times, but it varies by individual pieces of meat.

I&#39;ve also tried the chasu omelette before, which does a pretty incredible job of filling your senses with the nice savory aroma of Chinese food, even though it&#39;s just meat within an omelette. Super impressive if you ask me.

The sheer amount of value you get is insane here. For ~$10, you get pork chops (I&#39;d say the same amount that you&#39;d get if you were to order Chinese takeout), 2 eggs, homefries (or other sides, such as rice), and 2 pieces of toast. They have a basic assortment of Asian condiments (soy sauce, sriracha, chili sauce) available, as well as salt/pepper, etc., encouraging you to try mixing flavors together. There are a bunch of options available, so with how great the prices are here, I&#39;d recommend it even if you&#39;re not big on Chinese food specifically.

Also, the place seems to be a family-owned/managed (can&#39;t confirm, but pretty sure) kind of restaurant, as the place is small and works well together. The service here is great! The waitresses are outgoing and not shy about starting conversations or dishing out compliments. It&#39;s a really great experience coming here, especially since it&#39;s small and cozy inside. It gets busy from time to time, but I&#39;ve never had a problem getting seated around brunchtime (10-12)."

The steak was fine. They marinate it in soy sauce and garlic. I like their take on it, but quite naturally, it&#39;s damn salty, which I don&#39;t prefer (maybe a thicker cut of steak would balance it out). The spicy pork chops were unexpectedly deep fried. I enjoyed these quite a bit.

One thing they can definitely improve is the fried rice, which comes as one of three options with the order (this, regular rice [i think?] or home fries). I thought my first venture here was an off-day given how busy it was (I came here very close to closing time hoping the crowd would be low, but seems like everyone had the same idea because it was very busy) along with eggs and choice of toast. Portions of the rice were clumpy, and overall, it&#39;s quite bland for fried rice. Hoping for better on the second time with the pork chops, and it was the same deal. They may have just a giant vat of it sitting, causing the rice to harden and get like that. It wasn&#39;t served particularly warm either.

I enjoy their overall take on classic American breakfast food. I wouldn&#39;t call it Asian fusion in the meaning the vernacular is normally used: it&#39;s literally Chinese food served alongside American food, and it works delectably."

We were quickly seated and our order was taken. We ordered their famous steak and eggs. The food was delicious, cooked exactly to how it was ordered. I guess this place was mentioned on the radio that morning, and they were busier than they had expected. Two of three plates ordered came out together while the last took an addition 7 minutes. The fried rice that came with the steak and eggs was flavorless. We weren&#39;t checked on by our server after she took our order. They also scoffed at the tip we left. Which was a good tip considering the service. The busser, however, was friendly and attentive."

SERVICE:
This place is a disorganized mess.  For starters, there was a line of people waiting to sit &amp; there was no hostess. When a table opened up, a random person from the wait staff would  just shout at the patrons and sit whichever party fits the exact amount of seats available regardless of whose been waiting the longest. So if your party of two has been waiting for 20 minutes but a table for 4 opens up,  the party with 4 people will be seated even if they just walked in. 

When my husband and I were finally seated,  it was clear we did not have a designated waiter/waitress. The wait staff just kind of scrambled around us and would randomly stop or if table when they got a chance. 

FOOD:
Overall, the food was mediocre at best. My husband ordered the steak and eggs. The steak was pretty good (well cooked, well seasoned) but the fried rice was bland and literally tasted like somone just splashed a few drops of soy sauce in unseasoned rice. No egg. No veggies. It wasn&#39;t even fried! I ordered the spicy chicken wings and eggs. Again, the &#34;fried&#34; rice was bland as hell. I tried adding shiracha, soy sauce, chutney, etc but I could not make it worthwhile. The &#34;spicy&#34; chicken, was unseasoned (I&#39;m not exxagerating, there was zero seasoning &amp; no sauce on it) fried chicken with raw jalape√±o slices thrown on top. Unless you pop a jalape√±o in your mouth before evry bite there is ZERO spice and literally no flavor.

You get a lot of food for your money but most of it will be flavorless."

I had a party of 3 and we all got our food at different times. Of course me being the pregnant one got my food last out of us 3. So I was just watching everyone else eat while me and baby waited for our meal. Not sure how a steak comes out before French Toast. Hubby can go back, I&#39;ll stay at home."

What kind of planning do they have that allows this? I am, of course, deeply unsatisfied by this terrible planning and management.

Then my girlfriend ordered the breakfast plate and she realized that there was no included toast that the menu said would be part of it. She asked the waitress and the waitress said that their toaster was broken. That would have been better if they told us that ahead of our ordering so we didn&#39;t have to wonder why the meal was smaller than the price we were paying.

I ordered the chasu (BBQ pork) w fried rice and the fried rice is not really fried rice. It&#39;s just basically plain white rice with soy sauce stir fried for about a minute.

As I am typing this, the waitress just threw our check down on our table and I&#39;m not even halfway through my meal. I feel so rushed and unwanted.

Needlessly to say, I will not be coming back."

Although the steak is on the thinner side, it wasn&#39;t overcooked at all and was seasoned really well. The fried rice was a little bland by itself, but paired well with the more flavorful steak and eggs. This order also comes with two slices of toast as it is listed as a breakfast item. 

My friend got the spicy pork chop which I felt could have been seasoned with more salt, but the variety of condiments available on the table (A1, sriracha, chili oil, soy sauce, etc) made for a quick fix to that problem. 

Our server was quick and efficient, and came by several times to check up on us. I&#39;ll definitely come back to Uncle John&#39;s Cafe when I get the chance!"

I came to try the $11 steak after watching the BuzzFeed video. I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only one, and I was thoroughly pleased. No matter what temperature you want your eggs or steak, they cook them perfectly. The mixture of American breakfast and Chinese inspired food, even the mix of condiments on the table just put a smile on my face. A1, soy sauce, ketchup, AND Sriracha? Yes please! It was like going back home. The steak was tender and well seasoned, an amazing steal for the price. The eggs oozed perfectly and the fried rice was a nice side. The side of buttered toast was also heaven. I don&#39;t come across such fluffy slices often.

I will definitely be returning and bringing along my friends to experience what breakfast is like in an ABC&#39;s household.

I knocked off one star because it is a bit small and the wait can be long. They also have no sign in sheet or real system to keep track of who got there first. All honor system people so be nice! They also seat by number of people you have so if a 4-top opens up, they will seat a party of 4 before they seat a party of 2 even if the party of 2 got there first. I think this makes perfect sense but I&#39;m warning people so that it doesn&#39;t catch people off guard.

All things considered though, the food was fantastic and I can&#39;t wait to try the other items they have on the menu."

This place is a mess during lunch time; the workers are frantically running around and weaving through full tables to help customers. If you only have 30 minutes for your lunch break, I recommend calling ahead your order or you will never make it back to work on time. The service seems slow due to the lack of workers, so ask for your drink refills, condiments, etc. all at once.

The &#39;spicy pork chop (fried) &amp; eggs&#39;  plate is the reason why I come here, and will continue to come here a million more times. You can choose how spicy you would like your pork chops, which is an added bonus. Personally, I like to order my eggs over easy, so that the egg yolk drips onto the meat. The plate also comes with fried rice, white rice or fries, and your choice of toast. 

The portion sizes are large and reasonably priced compared to other restaurants in the area. I have not yet tried anything else on the menu. I am sure that I will eventually get around to looking at what else is on the menu, if I ever get sick of the pork chops."

When you walk in, you&#39;re able to seat yourself - which can be a bit confusing when you&#39;re going out to eat sometimes. We were attended to promptly with menus after picking out a spot. 

I ordered their steak &amp; eggs with fried rice, sourdough toast, and a Thai iced tea. Sooo DELICIOUS! I can&#39;t recall which style of steak I had (the place has hardwood floors which makes the restaurant a bit noisy), but our server said it was their most popular and of course I had to go with that. Didn&#39;t even bother pairing any sauce with the steak because it was THAT good alone! My boyfriend went with their teriyaki chicken, which I found out was crispy after stealing a few bites :) 

Only downside I can think of: Our orders were brought out separately instead of together. I, personally, feel it&#39;s rude to eat before/without the other person, so we waited for my boyfriends food to come out... which took another 5 minutes or so after mine. 

Still had a great meal and we&#39;d definitely stop by again next time we come down to LA!"

This is a great spot to come to for Americanized Chinese food in DTLA. My husband and I was trying to kick a horrible hangover, and Uncle Johns was calling our names! We got the Spicy Pork Chops and Tomato Beef -- both were excellent and filling AF. We also ordered a side of egg rolls which I would not recommend. They were GIGANTIC, and deep fried with some short of thick doughy skin. Definitely not like your traditional egg rolls but something you would get from a Jack in the Box drive through. The food was heavy and greasy -- definitely a perfect CURE.

I will say that the service was soooo damn slow. Friendly, but very slow. We sat down and it look 15 minutes to get our drinks ordered. Then we were waiting for a menu which took another five. Once we ordered the food, it took another 20-30 minutes for food, and we were already out of water...which you might&#39;ve guessed....took ages to get refills.

The pork chops and rice could have used a little bit of salt. Other than the green onions and chills scattered on top, it seriously lacked some good old seasoning. Or at least a couple shakes of salt and pepper, which I usually expect with this type of dish. 

Either way, the meat was perfectly cooked and the eggs were aesthetically so beautiful. These two eggs were the Brangelina of eggs. Cannot complain.

The food was delicious, fresh, and simple. I had the corned beef hash combo. Everyone ordered their own entree and for a party of five it was only $40 or so. AMAZING! Great experience, can&#39;t wait to come back!"

Wake up early yeah, but close down shop in time to Happy Hour. I didn&#39;t know such an Asianish place existed so close to city center. It&#39;s located in one of the ghettoest buildings on the block, but inside will mimic a nice clean diner. When that older Asian lady seats you, you&#39;ll be wanting a taste of that fried rice. Plenty of seating inside. There&#39;s even a small bar seating way up inside, but I opted for my high stool along the wall. I kept it real business, coat and tie, and didn&#39;t even flinch to take out my laptop out and pump out a few emails. People here are so chill. I like it here.

-=-Spicy Pork Chop with Fried Rice and Over Easy Egg-=- It was worth a shot with all the worshipping, and yeah, it&#39;s pretty dang great, but not worshipping great. Probably the best part about this would be that it&#39;s cheap. Menu combo didn&#39;t mention an egg, but I don&#39;t think I was charged extra either for asking for one. At around 10 bucks, I got all of the above and an English muffin. Out came a fried rice that could have used more soy sauce, and a spicy pork chop that could have used more salt. Still happy about it though. Did I mention that it was cheap? :D"

A time apart from the fast-paced and often overwhelming world. As the dawn cracks and the cock crows, there is one goal on everybody&#39;s mind: a comforting and hearty Brunch. Fulfilling this vision turns out to be harder than anticipated - as discussion soon reveals, there aren&#39;t in fact that many Brunch spots that are unanimously agreed upon as conveniently located, relatively inexpensive, AND outfitted with dank af food. Well look no further, for Uncle John&#39;s Cafe is nothing short of the apex of Brunch culture. In this Main Street hovel you will find the safe, reliable Brunch go-to you&#39;ve been searching for your entire miserable life. 

With regards to the timeless all-American ideal of Brunch, UJC offers few (if any) disappointments. The menu offers most of the essential members of the Brunch pantheon - a familiar assortment of eggs, omelettes, and waffles (all of which can be prepared several ways) is only the tip of UCJ&#39;s grand iceberg. To further sweeten the deal, these staples are reliably served with not one, but TWO sides - more often than not for a price tag under $10. Right from the start, the menu provides more than enough reason to wipe your memory of all other restaurants you have ever been to. 

But the true genius of UCJ is found on the back of the menu, which carries with it a delightful twist. This twist answers the groundbreaking question that only Uncle John has dared to ask: what happens if we served rice with eggs? 
That&#39;s right - this cafe is not only an all-American brunch spot, but a multicultural hub for Easterners and Westerners alike to indulge in the heartwarming Brunch staples of both hemispheres under one roof. 
UCJ&#39;s Asian catalogue is astonishing, and fits like a snug pear of briefs to their American counterparts. But these are not offered as an &#34;either-or&#34; ultimatum; quite the contrary, as Asian classics such as Chow Mein and Rice are seamlessly integrated into dishes such as eggs and pancakes. This courageous challenge of the Brunch status quo is one that society can learn a lot from - communities should all strive for its separate cultures to share relations as constructive and peaceful as those of the chopsticks and forks that share the same shelf at UCJ. 

As I type this now, I struggle to find an appropriate place to end my positive feedback of Uncle Joe&#39;s. The ingenuity that the joint has been built upon is apparent from the moment you walk through the door. What could easily have been a cumbersome pair of restaurants, needlessly occupying precious block space that could have been a Pilates studio, or a froyo shop, or a homeless man&#39;s personal latrine has been fused into one perfectly compact venue. In this venue you will be met with the finest Brunch experience that the West Coast can offer - an experience that even you and your lazy, piss-broke friends will be able to afford."

It&#39;s a family run and welcoming place. It&#39;s fun. They fill a nice niche downtown that covers a long history. The menu is deep and old school, stuff that has a long Chinese American legacy. Not a lot of these places still around. 

Food is good and plenty. I&#39;d say to keep an eye on this place. The kids have taken over. For some places like Paul&#39;s Kitchen in Monterey Park that was a downward spiral. These &#34;kids&#34; are thoughtful, energetic and focused. They will take it to another level. 

Suggest you ask them for menu suggestions. All good, but they can tell you about their most recent achievements."

Seriously the best plate in the house...screw it, best in downtown. I&#39;ve been coming to this spot since they were on 8th street.

The spicy pork chop with fried rice and 2 eggs was delicious--the pork was crispy and the addition of chopped green chillies gave the whole dish a good kick. You wouldn&#39;t really think about eating rice for breakfast, but the flavors together just made sense! Reminds me of something I would get back home.

Tried the chicken broccoli on the special. it was ok. didn&#39;t love the gravy, but liked the chicken.  it came with some sweet wontons, which were pretty good.

The third time, I tried the pork chops which fall in between the 2. They were cooked well and had a small level of spice, which was good.  They&#39;re fried.  As far as relatively inexpensive pork chops go, I&#39;d recommend them, but I&#39;m not one to go after pork chops all that often.  They had a fried batter around them, sort of what you&#39;d expect from slippery shrimp and you can increase your heat since they had chopped jalapeno on the dish.

The breakfast menu is pretty standard, though you can get hybrid items like grilled pork chops &amp; eggs.  Typically I come here for lunch and either take a crack at one of their daily lunch specials, or the spicy pork chop.  They overload your rice with chopped jalapenos and the pork chops themselves are pretty delicious.  Not exactly sure how they lightly bread these chops, but they are damn tasty.

I ordered the Steak &amp; Eggs with  fried rice and it was just bad. The steak had no seasoning whatsoever, not even salt. There was a huge strip of fat on one side of the steak. I asked for medium and they gave me rare. Asked for over easy eggs, they gave me over hard. The fried rice had clumps in it that resembled a cliff bar as if someone took a handful and squeezed it really hard in their hand and then put it on the plate. 
       The old guy delivering the food had his thumb in my fried rice the first time and his dirty thumb which he had just bussed a nearby table with on my steak the second time when I had them redo my eggs which they still f*cked up on.  I ate about half of it before i got grossed out by the bloody steak and told the server about it but of course, as expected nothing was done about it."

My fav is the Spicy (fried) Fish.
My S/O loves the Spicy Pork Chops.
I tried the Shrimp Egg Foo Young for the very first time here at Uncle John&#39;s.  It was very good.

I&#39;ve been here twice per my coworkers&#39; recommendation and to accompany coworkers and I&#39;m offended by what they consider Chinese food. Not only is it not real Chinese food because of how they cook it and the ingredients they use, but also the flavors just are not good.

Perhaps I&#39;m ordering all the wrong things. I&#39;ve had the kung pao chicken and something else I don&#39;t remember. When I got the kung pao chicken, I seriously said &#34;what the heck is this?&#34; out loud. There was too much vegetables and not enough chicken, the vegetables they used were so American (like carrots and celery), and the sauce tasted all wrong. 

I&#39;m not going back."

The new location is really nice. You get to sit down relax and have an enjoyable lunch and breakfast.
This is one of the best places to eat in Downtown Los Angeles. They have really cool menu and the family that owns it is really cool it&#39;s like they remember all of their customers and are so happy to see you return.
I always have the Chinese style spicy pork chops, fried rice with shrimp and 2 eggs over easy. 
I usually will break the egg yoke on the rice and eat it like that. The spicy pork chops are not really that spicy but full of flavor. 
You can compare the chops to other Chinese restaurants salt and pepper pork chops, but a 1000 times better.

Pricing is amazing the freshest food with 2 people and 2 sodas costs about $20 bucks. 
The chow mien, kung pow chicken and shrimp is really good too.  
The soups are amazing I forget the name but they have one with baby bok Choy like a wonton soup it&#39;s amazing on a cold day.

I&#39;d love to give this place 10 stars if I could."

Not at all.

Inside? Fairly elegant seating, especially for the price, and some tasty, comfort Chinese food. I had the special - Cashew Chicken with Eggrolls. It was very good. Check this place out. And I&#39;ve heard the breakfast is great too! Bbq pork and eggs sound great to me."

The servers here aren&#39;t exactly the most bright and cheery, but their service is still professional. And again... that omelette was awesome, and reasonably priced for the meal.

I had to try the spicy pork chops, sunny side up eggs, and fried rice. The staff is nice, friendly, and attentive. The pork chops get the spice from jalapenos, green onions, and a secret salt; but since I mostly avoided the jalapenos, it wasn&#39;t spicy. I did bite into a few jalapenos, but I didn&#39;t over do it. There seemed to be a lot of regulars, and the staff is Chinese, kool-kool! It would be difficult, but I need to come here for breakfast!

I&#39;ve always talked about this place that it&#39;s one of the greatest and it has history and so forth to everyone I know. Co-workers, friends, anyone who asks, where can I get something really good and don&#39;t have to pay an arm and a leg for it. I&#39;ve come here as often as I could including a weekend just to feed the meter and eat here.

Today, was a very difficult day at work and I really needed to take a walk before I rip someone&#39;s head off. Sunshine and the heat of this great Tuesday afternoon really puts a reality check because I really love AC. Walking in here 10 minutes to close may also be the reason why but I&#39;m already starving, tired, beaten down and just need something good to eat. It&#39;s like comfort food in a way and maybe because it&#39;s Chinese food done a little differently. 

I asked if I can still order to go so I&#39;m not disrupting their closing process. Chairs are already on the table, busboy already mopping the floor. I walk to the back counter and gaze upon the menu. The older gentleman was so kind to suggest something for me to order. I figured he probably was talking to the lady or the younger gentleman behind the counter who was carrying on a busy conversation in Chinese. I look up to say, &#34;huh? What?&#34; in hopes that he would repeat what he said so I probably would order that suggestion. The other two at the counter said in Chinese, &#34;he probably didn&#39;t even hear you or even understand you. Just shut up and go about your business and leave him alone so he can order.&#34; That really made me think, how insensitive but it is the end of their work day as I was thinking how rude that was. I kept my Chinese mouth shut and ordered a cha shu omelette in English. I can hear the guy repeat it in Chinese, he wants a cha shu breakfast plate. Maybe it&#39;s said a little differently so I&#39;ll go with it. What I received was a plastic plate covered in tin foil and under that was 2 eggs, sunny side up and cha shu on fried rice. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6iJ_E5tMJII601mrzwwdrQ?select=mYd0IHAuUylM_loTrpqk2w#QE2yyWrkaLOqIuTwEpkwNQ Good enough for me because I was hungry, tired and had to walk back before I can dig in.

Note to self: this is probably my last time to visit this place if they don&#39;t remember I speak Chinese and understood each word they spoke. I could have said good bye and thank you all in Chinese so they would be shocked but I decided to be civil and let it go. I may go back one more time and hope I get to speak to the older gentleman who was so kind to make suggestions. For his sake, I hope this place doesn&#39;t shut down because of the attitude I got in the service even though it was take out. I hope the second son is reading this on his laptop sitting at the front door. Thank you for the greeting as I walked in. (I&#39;m just sayin&#39;)"
uncle-johns-cafe-los-angeles,Brian I.,BYn4ABAe-M4X7cehYKu98w,"Los Angeles, CA",1,1,1,1181,344,uir5OH_0RQvKNUvv4-ZbQQ,4.0,2012-09-16,"I was walking around downtown LA in a suit and wanted breakfast and I found Uncle John&#39;s Cafe, a Chinese American restaurant serving. It&#39;s been around since 1975 originally on 8th &amp; Olive and it is now in the Stillwell Hotel as of 2010. I read their old place is pretty old school, but this new spot is pretty spacious. It has tall ceilings, plenty of seating spaces--counters, 4 seater and 2 seater tables, etc.--hardwood floors, 2 flat screen TVs. So it&#39;s looking good. It has a brown and white color scheme so it gives a pretty homely feel as it should since it is a family owned business. They attract local regulars, probably coming in for years, who probably feel at home. 

All meals are under $10 and if I remember correctly, tax is included in the pricing so all you need to do is add tip. Credit card minimum is $15, so dine with a friend or two to meet the minimum otherwise bring cash. The service is excellent and my light conversations feel like talking to uncle or aunt and I realized as I&#39;m writing this maybe that makes sense from the name of this cafe, Uncle John&#39;s. If you ask them what the best thing to get on the menu, they&#39;d most likely tell your their spicy pork chops and that&#39;s true. 

Again, it&#39;s a Chinese American restaurant that&#39;s been around for a while, so you&#39;ll see some traditional Chinese dishes and some American (whatever that is) and a little mix of both. So the first time I went to Uncle John&#39;s I had the famed Sricy Fried Pork Chops and eggs. It included wheat toast and home fries, and those are good especially with Tabasco or Sriracha if you will. The chops were crispy and tasty, salted about right. I went on a Tuesday last week and had their special, recommended by one of the &#34;aunty&#39;s&#34; and that&#39;s the Kung pao chicken with egg fuyung and that was good. I wonder what I&#39;d try next. 

I have quite a few breakfast spots in Downtown LA. This one may not get the attention like the historical other breakfast spots, but I&#39;ll dine here."

This place had no wait at all, but the restaurant was still pretty busy. We got to sit at the table next to the cherry blossom tree, so that was nice.

We ordered a bottle of Sayuri to start with and shared the Jessica Alba roll, omg yellowtail, chirasi bowl, sashimi combo B, a bowl of udon, a black tiger roll, a spider roll, and added an extra bowl of miso soup. The udon came with mixed tempura and we also received two bowls of miso soup that came with a couple of things we ordered. Everything came out super fast! We literally had to wait a couple minutes for each dish to come out. Service was also friendly and very attentive.  

Everything was fresh and delicious. My favorite was the omg yellowtail that I ordered. The only roll I didn&#39;t like was the spider roll, which had softshell crab in it. It was pretty plain and wasn&#39;t anything special.

We didn&#39;t see anything interesting for dessert, so we asked for the bill. We were given 5 complimentary ice cream macarons from the manager, which was a nice surprise. We thanked him from a distance and I devoured mine pretty quickly. The macaron shell had a nice texture and ice cream was also really yummy."

Throughout the evening there were numerous mishaps such as mistaking an order of beer for a pitcher, multiple people bringing us miso soup even after it was delivered, and 2 of the 4 of our meals being delivered 25 minutes after the first meal.  Miso soup was super salty, and our bento boxes were inconsistent - one had ginger salad dressing, the other had none, one had tempura sauce to dip, the other didnt.  Our waitress, while super sweet, was overwhelmed, apologetic and I&#39;m afraid her lack of English skills really got in the way of her doing her job.

Originally from LA, moved 4 years ago, this was one of my favorite lunch spots. However, after returning I&#39;d have to say that, though the food is great, the service is lackluster. Which really is a shame,  I believe that good service makes the dining experience more pleasurable. It wasn&#39;t particularly busy, yet getting water was a feat in itself,  little things like getting a side of Wasabi was also difficult , couldn&#39;t get the waiter attention.

Despite, having great restaurants (e.g. sushi gen) I like the prices here. Taste is great, presentation is nice.

If you&#39;re looking for decent food and variety of options without long lines,  I recommend this place.  My preference of service could&#39;ve been this one time

How we roll (pun intended): always kick off the meal with some miso soup (especially on them chilly nights), for appetizer we get it cracking with the sea weed salad (first time I tried it was at Tenno and now I&#39;m hooked), then we move into the rolls (too many good ones to name), and of course we top it off we an ice cold Sapporo.

Enjoy!"

Came in with a couple of friends for the happy hour deals. I didn&#39;t expect it to be anything special but I&#39;m pretty impressed. Oysters are $1.00/each (limit 3 per person),  variety of rolls, simple sides like fries (the best kind: skinny fries!!). Not to mention, if you buy a large beer, you get a free sake!

As I&#39;m eating and writing my review, I can honestly say the spicy albacore hand roll was really good. Fries are of course good and Queenie seems to really be enjoying her beer and sake. So win win all around."

It&#39;s yummm and lots of good servicejust returned from Asia, so I feel I speak with some authority. The ambiance, service and food were top notch! I have never felt so welcome! 
We ordered sashimi (melted in our mouths) and several rolls. The staff all came around to make sure all was good! The manager even came by and made us feel incredibly special. 
The menu selection was vast and creative! Please try this place and not wait over an hour to get into Sushi"

I was trying to find a new place to eat sushi with a friend of mine. But with the one wanted to go to closes early, we searched the block. After figuring out this place didn&#39;t scream business casual clientele, we went in. 

I ordered the Pink Lady along with the tuna roll and dynamite for an app. Got the rolls first. I&#39;m so happy I got the Pink Lady. It was a mixture of sour that I love. I was a bit unhappy with the app only because it tastes better with the stuff on top. Without it, it tasted like a bland seafood soupy thing. 

All in all, I love the place and would love to go back again. Thank god for autocorrect."

It&#39;s very much a family restaurant or somewhere that your parents would go eat with their friends after a long hot day of playing golf lmao. 

I love all the banchan (side dishes) because they taste really home made. Loved everything I ordered here so far except the nang myun (cold buckwheat noodle) but that just maybe because I prefer the taste of Yu chun&#39;s vinegary broth better. 

They give you a sweet fermented rice drink at the end, if they don&#39;t give it to you, ask for it!!!! Don&#39;t let them play you like that! Haha kidding. But seriously. 

Tiny lot in the back but never had issues finding a spot. Entrance on Olympic RIGHT after KFC"

My mom would always to-go dishes from here for dinner and the food is really solid regardless of what you get. She also loves the fact that you get about 8 or 9 side dishes and steamed egg with your meal when you eat in the restaurant. 

Unfortunately, when I went with my family, I guess it was exceptionally busy (for Surawon) but it didn&#39;t seem like it was THAT busy for a normal restaurant. All the tables were filled and there was a party or two waiting for a table and there were two servers. It is really not that large of a restaurant btw. My mom and sister came to Surawon&#39;s defense though and told me that they had never actually seen the restaurant this filled.

We ordered a sullungtang, nengmyun+galbi combo, and a boodae jjigae. The sullungtang was brought out quickly and accurately but when my nengmyun came out, it was mul (water) nengmyun instead of the bibim (mixed) I ordered. We told the waitress and she was apologetic about it and brought out the correct one a bit later. She also brought the boodae jjigae but failed to provide any bowls or rice. We had to flag her down and ask for it and asked for more water. She took the pitcher but never brought it back so we had to ask again for water. 

I mean, it wasn&#39;t the worst service ever but it was definitely not good. The food was all good though. I would definitely suggest people to give it a try and I would come back if someone else suggested it. For parking, there is a small, free, valet-less lot in the back."

It does have a spicy kick so if you can&#39;t do spicy ask them to make it a little mild. I love their togo packaging, they give you your order in plastic tupperware. 

In the mornings they have togo soups until 10:30, I like their yuk gwe jang for 6.99, they charge a dollar to get it to go! But I think they still have great prices."

I usually go to Yu Chun because they specialize in cold noodle but they close at 9! Checked this place and they closed at 11pm on a Friday. Got here and found out they stop serving cold noodle by 9pm! So disappointed.. I had to choose a noodle soup that was hot instead. I ordered the Kalbi Tang ($12.99) which has noodles in it. Since the server lady knew I really wanted cold noodle, she said she would give me extra noodles, which was nice. There is also a lot of meat that comes inside this dish too. IT was pretty delicious even though it wasn&#39;t what I came here for.

Overall, the service was really good.. the lady who served us was really nice and friendly. She was very generous and didn&#39;t hesitate at all when we requested refills on all the side dishes. 

There is free parking here btw! No need to valet or anything. There is plenty of parking behind the building in a lot."

Don&#39;t judge a book by it&#39;s cover, the original place used to be a Mexican restaurant. The aunties who work here are generally very nice and kind. The kimchi and banchans tasted fresher here than most places in K-town (in my opinion). The soups, the fish, the dumpling, and meat are all very good. I can&#39;t really critique on anything.

Their sullantang is a must-try! I ordered the spicy Beef neck soup and my girlfriend ordered the ox tail soup (2nd time in a row). We also ordered the seafood and leek pancake to share and it was bomb 

One thing I like about Korean restaurants is their side dishes. This place provides hella side dishes to costumes and on top of that, they also give you  hot steamed egg. 

Last but not least, service is on point and 10/10 would come back again  if you like hot soup and want some comfort food, put this on your to-go list"

First, the interior; well its clearly a mexican restaurant.  Until you come, you won&#39;t know what a cactus chandelier is.  I&#39;m here for the food and well that was just okay.  The gamjatang that we got was definitely the better of the two soups with more flavor and a richer broth.  They also gave a decent portion of neck bones for you to gnaw on.  The beef with cabbage soup was just plan boring soup; I wouldn&#39;t recommend it.

Service here was good even though the older lady&#39;s english wasn&#39;t the best but she seemed nice.  They also give a sweetened drink instead of water at first but water is available upon request."

Service was very friendly. Though I don&#39;t speak any Korean, we were able to communicate just fine. She was always smiling and very patient when I had no clue what I was doing.

The decor is something else to behold, with korean paper menus posted on walls of a former Mexican-themed restaurant still in all its cactus-chandeliered glory. I&#39;m guessing they figured everyone is there for the food and no one will care about the weird decor, which I think they are mostly right.
