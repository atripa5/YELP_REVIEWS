I went with the Rueben sandwich.  It was served with chips, and was large and tasty.  The menu is simple food, nothing fancy, which is great for a quick bite.

Service was a little slow, which was surprising since there were only 2 other people in the restaurant."

For a hotel restaurant it is quite good, including service. I only had breakfast but it was way better than I thought. The omelette bar was great with some interesting options like fancy egg white ones with veggies. The biscuits were jalape√±o flavored and perfectly cooked, as was the homestyle gravy. 

The pastries were really good with bakery quality scones and muffins. The smoked salmon and oatmeal bar were great. 

So a generous four stars for the hotel breakfast buffet as long as you don&#39;t mind the price and have the right expectations."

We dined here on a Saturday night at 7:30 and we were seated in a very small room with 4 tables, all of them empty. There was a room off to the side that held many more tables but it had a completely different atmosphere - much brighter and looked more like where breakfast would typically be served in a hotel. One table occupied in there.

We waited 10 minutes after being seated for any sign of life. Finally our waiter hurried over, apologized for the wait and asked if we knew what we wanted to order. No mention of specials or soup of the day or mention of a cocktail. We attempted to order but they were out of the chicken dish my wife wanted. Where did the chicken go - the restaurant was deserted! And the manner in which our server communicated was just not very friendly. The reply was, &#34;We&#39;re out of that. What else can I get you?&#34; When she told the server she needed a minute, he walked away and did not resurface for 15 minutes. Where did he keep disappearing to??

Then, a strange man appeared at the table next to us (someone else had come!) and introduced himself as the restaurant supervisor. He made some odd comments about how it must be date night and then shook each of their hands. Not to be a germaphobe, but would you really want to shake a stranger&#39;s hand in the middle of your meal? He then made his way to our table and commented, &#34;Oh - I see you&#39;re having some wine and food....&#34; Well, it is a restaurant, right?!?! Thankfully, we were not forced to shake hands and he let us be.

A wedge salad (very awkward to eat but tasted good) and mushroom soup (good) were delivered and then on to the ribeyes that we ordered. Both were ordered medium. Mine arrived medium-well and my wife&#39;s was very well-done. Mine was OK. It didn&#39;t have much flavor to it at all, but it was a decent, if fatty cut of meat. There was supposed to be a sauce on the dish and there may have literally been a half teaspoon of it under the dish. The &#34;fried&#34; brussels sprouts were burned and inedible. The mashed potatoes were very bland. 

Absolutely abysmal service. Our bread/butter serving plate was never removed during our meal (just sat there empty). Also, our soup/salad dishes sat empty in front of us for about 20 minutes until our meal arrived. They did not appear to have any buss staff. Odd service, odd setup, odd staff. 

When the waiter finally appeared (he never checked in to see how our meal was), my wife asked if he could bring extra sauce because her steak was well overcooked and dry. He simply said, &#34;OK&#34; and walked away.

After he returned and until we left, he actually had some personality and then apologized for the steak. Must be the same waiter from another review - he was withdrawn and disinterested for the first 3/4 of our meal and then suddenly came to life, maybe to save his tip. It was too late by then. 

The food was a 3 for me (2 for my wife) and the service from the waitstaff to the creepy supervisor was a 0."

We went to this restaurant three times.  First time I went with my husband for lunch.  They have the $9 lunch menu that came with a drink, main meal and a small cake as a dessert.
I got the salad/ sandwich combination. The sandwich was better than the salad.  The service was good and the waiter at the bar really take good care of us.  He made me a wonderful drink and offered refill.  I loved the drink.

Second time I went with my young son, still sat at the bar/lounge area.  This time it was much busy and we only got basic lemonade, nothing special.

Third time I went with my husband again and we sat inside the restaurant.  The waiter was kind of hard to understand and he made some mistake with my order and was rude. Later on he tried to be nice.  Now the $9 lunch no longer includes the drink and the salad has add on charge for the &#34;protein&#34;. The panini was very good."

The frontage in that area was starting to look like a ghost town.  Mickey&#39;s has several other locations dotting the southland.  

I&#39;ve been here twice, both dine-in experiences.  They do have a drive-through option, but since the food is made to order, I&#39;m not sure how the drive through is actually very convienet.  The interior is clean, semi-comfortable, with seating for about 35 people.  Two big screens are in the corners, usually tuned into some sort of sports. 

Service here is great.  You walk in and order at the counter; the menu is rather extensive for such a small place (Gyros, BBQ, hot dogs, burgers, beef sandwiches, ect....), but you never feel rushed to make a decision.  After you place your order, you get a number, seat yourself, and they bring the food out to you.  What I aprreciate the most, is that the cashier will come up with the best possible way to ring up your order.  Perhaps you were unaware of combos; they will ring you up for them automatically, instead of all ala carte like ordered.  I like the honesty.

My first meal here consisted of the fried chicken dinner.  I know they come in sizes, and I&#39;m not sure which one I ordered.  I do know there was a lot of food.  Large pieces of chicken, cole slaw, crinkle cut fries, and some BBQ sauce on the side.  The chicken was OK; better than the Jewel deli, but not quite good as Brown&#39;s.  The BBQ sauce was good, very tangy.  

Second time, I had the gyros plate.  I&#39;m sure the gyros sandwich would have been more than enough.  The plate is just massive amounts of food.  It comes with 2 pitas, a pile sliced onions and chopped tomatoes, lots of cucumber sauce, and some feta cheese. Crinkle cut fries, and a mound of gyro meat that rivals Mt. Olympus.  (Well, maybe not that much, but you get my point.)  The meat is good, very tender, flavorful and fresh.  

I liken this place to a alternative to Portillos.  They have a similar meu, but yet Mickey&#39;s is way more affordable, without that machine-like atmosphere.  I know I will find my way back here again, since I live down the road.  I&#39;m going to have to swing in to get a Chicago-stlye dog, and updated this review Dan B. style!"

My husband had the gyro and we got a shrimp dinner special to share. The amount of food that we received was intense! My salad was huge with big chunks of chicken and feta and their house Greek dressing was delicious. The gyro was yum too. My only gripe was the fried shrimp, they hadn&#39;t been cleaned properly and every shrimp still had that gross black nerve thing going down its side.

I love how Mickey&#39;s has food runners that bring everything to your table. I would have loved to have my delicious cream of chicken with rice soup prior to my sandwich. Perhaps that was something I should have mentioned beforehand to the cashier. No big deal.

Dining area has plenty of clean tables and great for family&#39;s of 5 or so. I was surprise to see that the building did not have a Mickey&#39;s Gyros neon sign on the front. During rush hour traffic stopped on route 53 would probably prove affective and in their favor. 

I do plan on a second visit for their BBQ side of the menu, for now 3 stars is what was earned. I do suggest this place to meat and cheese lovers whom enjoy Chicago style sandwiches.

But the last few times I&#39;ve gone I&#39;ve been disappointed my gyro has been hard and just tastes old and my fries that usually were always perfect and crispy have become soggy and I just went there today and I get BBQ on the side and they poured it all over my fries inside the fries bag so it was a BBQ potato mess not sure if it was miscommunication or what, hard to believe anyone would enjoy it like that and maybe if it wasn&#39;t in that cheap bag so it just kinda molded itself to the BBQ sauce and fries to or fell apart..I guess if your gonna do it like that it should be in a different container.  I&#39;m thinking maybe there has been a change in the kitchen. And prices have seem to gone up with the decline in appetizing food.

In the ample parking lot, I got out of my car and entered the restaurant to be greeted by friendly wait staff behind the counter. Since I am an Italian Beef connoisseur, I ordered the beef sandwich with sweet peppers, French Fries, a side of red sauce, and a large Pepsi. I was handed a placard with a number, found a seat, and before I could say Jack Robinson, the same counter server had a tray with my food at the dining table I selected. The Italian Beef was thinly-sliced tasty pieces piled high on a very fresh French bread roll. It had very enjoyable and tasty sweet peppers, and an ample side of delicious red sauce. This had to be home-made, because it wasn&#39;t too spicy, but was thick with an excellent flavor. Only downside with my meal was that the French bread was totally soaked with au jus, so I had to eat it with a plastic knife and fork. This was fine, because I ate in, but if I were to attempt to eat this sandwich in the car, or on the go, it would have been a disastrous mess. Maybe I should have asked for &#34;dry,&#34; so possibly that was my fault. I loved the French fries; they were HOT, and very crispy on the outside, and soft on the inside. I dipped the fries in red sauce, after slathering a good portion of the red sauce on my sandwich. The place was packed, and everyone there seemed to be enjoying their meals. As I was leaving, I was given a friendly &#34;good bye&#34; from the person who I believe was the owner or manager. I said that I enjoyed my food and the visit to his place, so he shook my hand, and invited to come back again soon."

The chicken sandwich is outstanding, especially on the French bread. Packed with sliced grilled chicken breast, lettuce, tomatoes and mayo....need a fork to eat some of the chicken out of the sandwich before eating it by hand.  Definitely get your moneys worth on the chicken.

Have had the hot dogs and had a beef combo the other day.  Those are both good as well.

Watching TV, a commercial for Burger King&#39;s chicken parm sandwich came on.  I had a total Homer Simpson, all out drooling, &#34;mmm chicken parm&#34; moment.

My co-worker and I also have a problem.  It&#39;s lunchtime, we&#39;re starving, and we order more food than we can (or should) consume.  For her, it&#39;s 2 burgers, fries and onion rings.  For me, it&#39;s chicken parm, fries, soda and mini Cinnabons.  This is absolutely insane and I would not recommend anyone attempt this.

The chicken parm was a disappointment.  The cheese wasn&#39;t melted.  I had the impression this was similar to their Italian chicken sandwich, which used to make comebacks like the McRib, but it was blah.  The fries were semi-cold and lacked saltiness or crispiness - all things I expect in fast food!

And the Cinnabons were like Pillsbury canned junk.  I expected sizzling hot, gooey icing and cinnamon goodness.  I got stale-ass buns.

My Dr. Pepper was watered down also and lacked some carbonation.

The guy at the drive-thru was really nice, friendly, and easy to understand.

In hindsight, I should&#39;ve went to Chipotle instead spending $11 on a Burger King meal.  I&#39;m ashamed."

X pancakes? No, Y. 
So that was X? No it was Y.

Spoiler alert: We got X. Of course. 

We also got the Downtown dish. This is the two-egg dish every restaurant has. It&#39;s so, so, SO hard to mess up. They messed it up. 

Eggs were wrong, the sausage was burnt so badly it would have needed dental records to ID it as a meat product, and....well, I asked for an English muffin as toast. They gave me one....untoasted. Who would eat an untoasted English muffin? Seriously. A THREE YEAR OLD can make toast correctly.

We ordered food and in less than ten minutes, most of the food came out! The service is super fast and attentive.

I ordered the Super 7 salad and it reminded me of a cole slaw of some sort with a piece of salmon. For the price I was paying, I was hoping for a bigger piece of salmon but overall, the salad is super filling and I felt really healthy after. All my friends enjoyed their food thoroughly.

Since I&#39;ve started going there, they&#39;ve changed how they seat people or maybe I just go when it&#39;s not crazy busy. I suggest not going on a Friday around lunch. We had to take a pager and wait 20 min. I wish you could order your food while you were waiting, but they don&#39;t let you. 

We luckily ended up sitting at the bar, but I would do that again. The service was fast once you got your food. The BLT minus the avocado had great taste, but was extremely messing wow!

It was pretty disappointing. The small bits of beef in the hash were not very tender. The potatoes seemed like they were either dehydrated and re-hydrated or had been previously frozen. The biscuits on the side were pretty flavorless. 
Hubby had the steak and eggs. Meat was though and chewy. It didn&#39;t have much flavor other than the brown sauce poured over it. He ordered eggs over easy and they were served sunny side up. We were never asked how the food was or if we wanted more drinks.

The cookie skillet was pretty good but probably should be shared by at least two people. Unfortunately for me,  I went with two guys who were not that into sweets, so I was forced to devour most of it myself. Not a pretty picture. 

Service was still outstanding though! I definitely recommend going here!"

I called 20 minutes away I came in and paid my food wasn&#39;t ready again all I ordered was a salad. Shopped around the store came back and still had to wait another 10 more minutes. When I got home I realized my salad was missing ingredients and the tuna was cooked well. Disgusting! Pictures are included. The meat looks like chicken not tuna!!!! Awful awful awful experience!

First impression: the supermarket is clean, modern, and spacious. There&#39;s a produce section, a deli, a butcher/meats section, a seafood section, and a dry goods section. It&#39;s kind of a smaller scale whole foods. 

Produce isn&#39;t cheap but it is quality. Hey, you get what you pay for. 

I&#39;ve bought quinoa from here before. This trip I made specifically to pick up some prosciutto di Parma ($21.99/lb) for the prosciutto wrapped chicken with pesto I was making that night. Good stuff! Also, the staff is nice and super eager to help."

Located in Standard Market, the cafe is located immediately to your left upon entering. Very spacious dining area with easy navigation and clean decorations. After all, how your home looks = how you look = how your food tastes. 

Their food is fresh. No guilt trip after eating here! Expect $$ for lunch. 

1. Baker&#39;s Dozen. 
Steak was tender. The salad isn&#39;t overdressed. Lots of variety/toppings in this salad. 

2. Tuna Cobb
Tuna is perfectly seared (rare in the center). The vinaigrette adds a good acidic touch to the salad. 

3. The Grill Club
Club sandwich is a decent sandwich. Fries are crisp and salted well.

Overall, I would definitely come again."

One burger was completely raw, the other burned, the grilled cheese was burned on one side and then hid. The salad wasn&#39;t dressed, tossed, nor did it have any chicken. We asked for a new grilled cheese, 25 min later, grilled cheese with bacon appeared. So, no cheese, just 1/2lb of bacon between 2 pieces of bread. We will not be returning for a long time...."

The Grill is inside of the grocery store, but off on the side to its own.  They have a large seating area with lots of tables and it looks like they have an outdoor patio for the summer too.  It wasn&#39;t too busy when I went but I heard it can get pretty packed during the lunch crowd.  The menu is comprised of burgers, sandwiches, salads, pizza and some other things.  I went with a Chicken sandwich called the Italian Job and it was delicious.  You get to choose a side of fries or salad as well.  You can opt for a soft drink, but they also have complementary water and fruit water.  The service was quick and friendly.  The quality of the food is reason enough to try if your in the area and I will definitely be back to try some of the other menu items.  It is a little on the pricier side.

Side note, take a walk around the grocery store too, its pretty impressive."

The 24 hour steak sandwich is phenomenal in my opinion as WAS the barbecue brisket sandwich. I can say I am SO disappointed with the new menu items that have replaced the BBQ sandwich as well as some other items . The roast beef sandwich is just not good at all and neither is the mustard chicken sandwich,They both taste like foods I would be served at some mediocre place.

This place is great to bring kids, laid back, foodie fast casual menu, and you can pick up groceries you may have forgotten on the way out.  Sometimes they can get a little TOO creative with their dishes but all in all there are some staples you can&#39;t go wrong with there. Also, on Friday and Saturday nights they may want to abandon the fast casual format and go full service for dine in guests and keep the cashiers line for take out only. We&#39;ve experienced service weirdness on those busy nights. But, still, it&#39;s a great casual place to chill with our son and take a load off. We go all the time!

I have dined here twice, only over the summer (on the patio, ordered the #1 Tuna Salad - delish!) and just recently late on a Saturday night. I made several modifications to my grass-fed burger to account for dietary preferences late into my ninth month of pregnancy and the service was most accommodating.

The grass-fed burger was fantastic (approx. $14), not at all greasy and the perfect entree to my side of thick, salty sweet potato fries. I ordered water naturally, but my spouse was able to enjoy a local draft from Two Brothers Brewery. He too ordered a burger (Roadside to be exact, with regular fries - approx. $12) and loved every bite. 

As mentioned, we arrived about an hour prior to closing so it was to be expected that they were cleaning up for the night. We did not receive the customary small dessert that typically comes at the end of the meal, but that&#39;s really not an issue. 

We sat at the bar and really did not have an issue flagging down servers when needed for mustard, extra napkins, etc. 

Can&#39;t wait to head back this summer and enjoy the patio once again!"

One that I would&#39;ve never discovered on my own and is so tasty.  Sweet potato fries with honey mustard.  Oh man.  

I had only heard about this place from radio ads and had been only mildly curious but was rather intrigued to try it when a group of ladies I recently befriended wanted to meet here for dinner one night.  

I had scoured the menu online beforehand and already knew what I was going to order: the bello burger with sweet potato fries.  An added bonus was that they serve the Goose Island bottled root beer which I love so much.  

When they brought my food to our table, I immediately requested ketchup, not even noticing the little cup of condiment that had already been placed upon my plate.  They informed me that they recommend the honey mustard with sweet potato fries.  Eww, I thought.  But I tried it and my God I am telling you...  It is so good.  I never, ever would have fathomed eating sweet potato fries with honey mustard but now that is the only way I will ever eat them.  

My bello burger was also very tasty.  I get so sick of veggie burgers so I&#39;m very thankful for portobello mushrooms to give me another alternative.  

The itty bitty brownies they pass out are a nice touch as well."

Rotating specials, fruit infused water, out of this world honey mustard with sweet potato fries and a complimentary bite of dessert, how could I not fall in love? Plus I can get my shopping done too? Awesome!

But then the relationship got rocky, long waits for food, prices going up and up, very inconsistent service, they even starting skimping on the free bite sized dessert (we waited oh so patiently)!  The worst part was the inconsistent food, soggy fries, watery milkshakes, raw dough in the pigs in a blanket, come on SMG, what happened?

When it&#39;s good, I&#39;d recommend a steakhouse burger with sweet potato fries, the bbq chicken sandwich, or Buddha bowl. I&#39;ve stopped recommending it to friends though, too much of a Dr Jekyll and Hyde thing going on right now, bring back the love!"

I ordered a standard burger with fries ($11) at the counter and found a seat after grabbing some of their-fruit infused water (watermelon in this case). Once inside the grill, you can easily forget that its attached to the market. The glassed-in area adjacent to the patio was well insulated from the hustle and bustle of the store itself. 

The burger came in a few minutes accompanied by fresh-cut shoestring potatoes. The fries were great and not at all soggy with oil (a danger with fresh thin-cut styles). The burger was as good as I hoped. Ordered medium, they nailed the desired doneness. More importantly, perhaps, was that it tasted great and was exceptionally juicy.

I can&#39;t recall dining at a more upscale counter-service restaurant. The little touches like the great infused water bar, decidedly high-quality (for paper) napkins and friendly staff really elevate the Standard Grill. Like the adjoining market, this can&#39;t really be considered a great bargain, but the prices are more than fair for the quality you get."

Once the service was stellar and wait time was no problem. 

Once the service fine and the wait time was okay. 

And once the person at the counter acted like he&#39;d have no problem spitting on me, and didn&#39;t even try to hide this fact (for the record, I have no idea why), and the wait was also unreasonably long (in this instance, I had ordered just a smoothie). 

The place was busy each time (varying days, week-end or week day), so that&#39;s pretty much going to be standard fare if you come here. I always managed to get a table but on at least one occasion it was one of the last ones available. 

Food is fair. I&#39;ve had the dreamsicle smoothie several times which has been my preferred choice, as well as various sandwiches, which were less exciting. 

The place is quite loud, and (like the store) on the pricey end, too much so for comparatively lackluster food.

With the prepared-food case available in the store, you might do well to do the &#34;to-go&#34; option there if you don&#39;t want to roll the dice as far as service and wait time at The Grill."

Yes yes, I completely sound like I&#39;m exaggerating. But really, all you need to do is go and you will understand what I am talking about.

Portions are fair and filling. If I could say something else about this place is that its quite clean feeling. This also includes the food that is served to you. Easy in terms of taste (not too salty). The presentation itself is clean and caught me off guard.

The Cali burger is just so awesome; if I didn&#39;t restrain myself, I think I&#39;d order this every time. There is something about this burger, with its honey mustard, gouda, tomato, and onion under a whole grain bun that screams &#39;not too heavy.&#39; Surely, it doesn&#39;t feel that way either and the burger itself lends a lot of sweet and savory flavor.

#1 tuna made me hold onto my seat because those seared pieces of tuna were HUGE. I had to snap back to reality and tell myself I was at the Standard market, not a fishing boat. They coleslaw as a component of this creation. I gotta tell you, the coleslaw here is FABULOUS. They have it nailed. I even order coleslaw as a side, in place of fries. Once I&#39;m done, I even walk to the deli in the market...after leaving the grill...and buy some coleslaw home. TRY THE COLESLAW.

24-hour steak sandwich was generous and delivered a punch. It is one of the heavier items on the menu but gets the job done if you&#39;re feeling it that day. Generous strips of steak, some blue cheese (not too strong), caramelized onions, and argula...all on a baguette. Beautiful.

As a side, you can get regular fries, sweet potato fries (awesome - they got this one down also - its actually crispy crunchy on the outsides and velvety soft on the inside - served with some honey mustard), or COLESLAW (goodness gracious).

Staff is attentive and will sometimes come and give you free pastries."

I usually place my order at SMG first, shop for the items I need, check out and then come back to pick up my order. They usually quote me 10-15 minutes and they&#39;ve been on time each time. 

My favorite salad is the Romaine Hearts salad--basically a grilled marinated steak salad. Very fresh ingredients, crispy veggies and wonderful dressing. But the menu changes up because it&#39;s not on the current menu (as of today). 

So this last time I went with the B.L.A.T--basically a BLT on brioche with avocado and a champagne aioli. Once I got home and tucked in, I noticed they missed the avocado. The sammie was already pretty amazing, but because I love avo, it was definitely missed. The aioli was very good too, the next time I order this I&#39;m going to ask for a bit extra on the side. And this sammie was just chock full of bacon. And these aren&#39;t skimpy pieces either; the bacon is thick, full of flavor and makes such a delicious layer in the sandwich. 

Service was always been nice. I&#39;d love to have the time to dine in one of these days..especially on the patio if the day is nice."

We both ordered burgers and I went with the brunch burger that has cheddar, bacon and a fried egg.  Husband had a plain cheeseburger.  Both were over-cooked, but with the fried egg yolk, it was not that noticeable since the dryness was avoided.  He didn&#39;t like his burger because of this.  Service is fast and the waitress was very nice."

I get that the fat is what tenderizes braised meats but no one wants a mouthful of fat. The kale salad was completely inedible with tough soggy greens and no flavor. The beans were ok and I rarely argue with a cookie.

You order your food upon entering, pay, and take a seat. Eventually your fiord and drinks are brought out to you by your &#34;waitress&#34;. The problem is that the kitchen doesn&#39;t prepare the meals as one order. Your &#34;waitress&#34; doesn&#39;t know what you&#39;ve ordered so there is no one concerned with getting the order to come out together. 
The food was very good though. Prepared to order and fresh or warm depending on what you&#39;ve ordered. 
This place is new so I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll work out the kinks."

My experience at the Westmont location was, err, substandard (at best).  Ordering was easy, but things went downhill pretty quickly after that.  The dining room was chaotic and crowded, and the server seemed very frazzled - she was very nice, but they had her delivering food, grabbing refills, and bussing tables with almost no assistance.  I got the Cuban sandwich, which had almost no flavor, and tried my friend&#39;s southwest steak salad, which also had no flavor.  I have no idea how they managed to make the dishes so bland because the sandwich and the salad were full of awesome, tasty ingredients.  The sweet potato fries were okay - I think they had been left under a heat lamp for too long.  We spent about $33 for lunch for two, which felt like way too much for what we got.  The grocery store looks nice, but I don&#39;t think I will revisit the grill area again unless they do a major reboot of the entire operation."

25 minutes for an English muffin - was told it&#39;s in &#34;the oven&#34; for 20 minutes - it came after we were done with breakfast. 
The decaf coffee - arrived after breakfast w the English muffin - all after we finished our breakfast.

Tonite, the steak was good and as usual, servers Forest and Max were very friendly and gracious.  

However, the Aquajito tasted like koolaid, while the center of the table outside needed the piece in the center that acts with the pager so the server knows where to serve.

I sent the drink back and Forest replaced it with another, that drink usually had Moonshine cherries in it; this time nothing.

Max gave us extra cookie brownies at the end. I do want you to know that this market grill is changing and not for the good."

Intrigued, I asked the barista where the smoke was coming from. She pointed to the grill, so I walked in to peruse the menu.

I was instantly drawn to the Cuban sandwich. I love them. I have to order them everywhere.

The sandwich here was excellent in its own right but as a Cuban sandwich it fell far short. First, I&#39;ll tell you why it was a great sandwich...

The thing is fijcking huge. I&#39;m a big guy. 200 plus pounds in a 6&#39;2&#34; frame. I hold my own at the all-you-can-eat... Right...

I was in pain getting the last five bites down but I couldn&#39;t save it and I damn-well  wasn&#39;t throwing it away... So, flick it, I finished it and the fries. But it was a challenge.

The bread was firm but tender. Warm and crispy but chewy inside. It was smeared with an aioli with some good spiciness.

The chicken was juicy and plump but the flavors of the marinade or grill were muted by the large surface area of the cuts.

The ham was thick and layer upon layer gave wieght to this bocadito and it was perfectly sweet and salty- delicious.

Then in the Cuban Sandwich rankings it plummeted...

The cheese was unrecognizable if there was any on it- flavorless.

The pickles were crunchy but bland. Maybe the cooking muted the sourness but they didn&#39;t give enough to the flavor profile. 

The fries were top notch shoestring cut with seasoning salt. Wicked.

The bags are some type of linen paper or other high quality paper befitting this ultr-high-end grill. Fancy-schmancy. 

I can&#39;t wait to go back and SAMPLE the lineup of craft brews on tap. ;)"

we LOVE the CUBE.... the wine and cheese area... 

we love it that we can get anything from the restaurant, and they bring it over to the Cube for us to enjoy -- last time we were here, we got the Farmers Market Pizza - yum...

another time we got The Smith burger (grass fed beef burger) to die for....

Even if we get an entree from the Grill, we always end up getting a cheese platter from THE CUBE...

We get wine and just talk to the knowlegeable cheese experts or I think they are called &#34;master affineur &#34;...

Stopped going for awhile due to some poor experiences but decided to give it another try since it&#39;s close to home. However, things weren&#39;t better- still very slow, inattentive wait staff....never greeted by server, our one and only soda came 15 minutes after our order was placed, no refills ever offerred, after another 20+ min we were informed kitchen was backed up and it should only be another 10 minutes for our burger and green salad. Quality of food was fine once it actually arrived but the irritation of the length of the time it took lingered. We were on a tight schedule and really didn&#39;t expect to be there as long as we were. 
Lastly, a promise to rectify a previous issue was never filled. We don&#39;t normally say anything but we had been very good customers since they opened and had some really poor experiences and finally after being embarrassed by low service quality when we brought some guests there, I sent an email to their office. A response to that took longer than it should have but was told &#34;something&#34; would be sent to us. 
Yeah, still waiting on that.....perhaps what they actually &#34;sent&#34; me was a big &#34;?:$@ you&#34; as nothing physical ever came. 
Just a thought... if the restaurant didn&#39;t have a &#34;no tip&#34; policy maybe the staff would be motivated to work together as a team to keep things on track as a whole?"

The line was long and they did not open a second register until I waited about 10 mi even though someone else was there handling the electronic notification pieces looking at all of us in line. That person finally opens another register.  My ticket said 7:47 pm and I received the pizza at 8:12 pm. Not sure how long it was supposed to take but I was really hungry. There was 2 1/2 to 3 inches of crust before the ingredients started which seemed like a lot of crust. I asked Katie if that was normal or skimpy. She said normal. I said I ordered pizza not bread. She half heartedly said they&#39;d make another but I told her I wasn&#39;t interested in waiting yet another 30 minutes for a second pizza with mostly crust. My Mother&#39;s sweet potato fries were over done also so she wasn&#39;t happy. The quality used to better but the last several times have not been too good.  The last time the Buddha bowl was just OK.  Also about three times we left because the line was so long... Maybe 10-15 people waiting to order.  Glad they have the business but probably not mine anytime soon.

Overall, I would say we had a positive experience. The restaurant and bathrooms were very clean which is of the utmost importance to me. In terms of food, my husband tried the grilled cheese and I had the shaved turkey sandwich. Both of us enjoyed our meals, though my husband and I agreed that my sandwich was better. He had the sweet potato fries with his meal and really enjoyed them. I had the home cut fries and they were really good, too! I very much appreciated the water infused with various fruits and vegetables. At the end of the meal, one of the servers brought us complimentary chocolate chip cookie bars, which was a nice touch. Later, we checked out the store which is filled with prepared meals for you to &#34;take and bake&#34; at home. The one thing that I did not love was the customer service. It was our first time there, so we were a little confused on how things worked. You order your food at the counter, they give you a tracker, and a server brings you the food. The cashier did not ask if this was our first time there and was yawning as she was taking our order. After I finished eating, I still had a half of my turkey sandwich and half my fries that I wanted to take home. None of the servers approached us to ask if I wanted a take home box, so I went up to one of the servers and asked her if I could please get a box to bring my food home. She replied, &#34;Um, you have to go to the bar for that,&#34; in a condescending tone. She then proceeded to go into the kitchen and stand near the bar. She could have easily brought me a container, but instead just stood there. So, I had to wait in line to ask the cashier for one. I did enjoy my food and the store, so I would probably give it another shot and hope they improve their customer service."

Not any more. The last 3 meals have been quite disappointing. Tonight, only 1 soup. Only 1 out of the 4 waters had a fruit infusion, usually all 4 have fruit or cucumbers. Order took forever. Grilled cheese came on heal of loaf and looked like someone sat on it. Toasted dry with little cheese and what looked like barely cooked bacon. Our neighbors waited 35 minutes for a steak sandwich with a tiny piece of raw looking steak and cold sweet potato fries. They had to ask for honey mustard. I hate to say this but I think they are on way out. They need some new management!!! What a decline in quality. Don&#39;t even try the taco bar. Tried that early in week, 8 people standing around making 1 taco at a time. Then they call a name and leave on counter for pickup where everyone stands to order. Thanks but no thanks."

There is no host stand.  You walk up to the register and place your order and find a table.  Or so I was told by the cashier.  We found an empty table on the patio and sat.  After a few minutes a server came to the table and asked if we would get up from a table-without an option of another table, because another couple had been waiting.  I was actually speechless and before I could say anything a table opened up behind us and the server said she would seat them there.  I have NEVER had that happen to me in a restaurant.  To add insult to injury, the couple kept talking out loud about us, as if we had stolen their table.  I chose not to ask for a manager and kept my cool.  The burgers were not that good-we could have had better at Five Guys.

After we left the store, I called and spoke to a manager, Marissa.  She explained that I did follow normal protocol, but since it was a Friday night it was busier and there can be a wait for a table and there must have been some miscommunication.  She also said that there should have been a hostess near the register.  I never saw her. 

We will never return here to eat.  I may still buy a couple of things from the grocery, but really not worth the time/drive for a handful of items.  Especially, when I can get friendlier customer service and not-so-snooty clientele at other nearby specialty grocery stores."

The restaurant menu has a wide variety of choices from pizzas and salads to seafood specials but I wasn&#39;t wow-ed by any of the items I&#39;ve tried. Tonight I ordered the ahi tuna cobb salad and it really lacked flavor. The ingredients were all fresh and the tuna was well seared but the combination was quite bland. My brother ordered the Buddah Bowl and that was especially tasty. It was a mix of brown rice, tons of veggies and your choice of protein (he chose steak). The sauce was really flavorful but not overpowering. I would definitely order this with chicken or even salmon if I go back! 

I like Standard Grill because the set up is relaxed and I think it&#39;s great for an easy weeknight dinner spot. You order at the counter and then your food is brought to the table by a waiter/ess. Service is usually quick and staff is friendly. They have a large dining room and a really nice sized patio as well. I&#39;m also a fan of the fruit infused waters---they usually have at least three different types and they are SO refreshing. 

I&#39;ll definitely give Standard Grill another shot but I&#39;m going to try out some other items on the menu."

We got there at just the right time, before they had to put people on a wait, so definitely go early at lunch to avoid that. Big menu so it was hard to choose - sandwiches, salads, pizza, etc. I tried the Grill Club (a variation on a club served on a bagel) primarily because it had brie and it was delish, with sweet potato fries. The fries were really good - you could tell they were actual sweet potato slices. I love the idea of the infused waters, although mine didn&#39;t taste like much it was a fun idea.

It looks like a big barn.  I&#39;m not sure why I never noticed it.  
I came here for lunch on a Friday.  We just beat the rush.  There is a decent amount of seating, but it does seem to get packed.  
I ordered a buffalo chicken burger with some sweet potato fries.  It was pretty good.  I feel like the ingredients are fresh because of the environment.  For those that don&#39;t know, Standard Grill is inside Standard Market, which is like an upscale, organic, premium market.  I don&#39;t know if that describes it properly.
They have a bunch of flavored water which is just large dispensers of water with fresh fruit floating around.  I think there was one that was citrus, another which was berry, and I don&#39;t remember the third.  After you order, you grab a seat and there is a wait staff that brings you the food and silverware etc. 
I came here with my manager so the trip was also a casual lunch meeting.  It wasn&#39;t so loud that we couldn&#39;t communicate.  He actually suggested the place, so I&#39;m glad I got to check it out.

What I was served was four triangles of bread that was hardly toasted with two slices of cheese in each that was not even close to being melted. To add insult to injury there was no bacon in the sandwich...AT ALL! I sent the sandwich back and then was served the same sandwich, each sandwich triangle pulled apart to expose the STILL unmelted cheese with hardly cooked bacon now added. I&#39;ve never been served the same substandard product twice at the same sitting. I refused to eat what was served and was issued a credit.

Kids got a pizza which was huge and could easily serve 2. I ordered a BLT which looked good because it had avocado. When it arrived, I had to search for the avocado.... two tiny little pieces. On the bright side, they had infused water for free and there was nice outside dining (with a view of the parking lot basically). We won&#39;t be returning anytime soon."

Great pizza , chicken salad, and desserts ! 

Especially enjoyed speaking with the kind gentleman which I believe is the owners cousin. He came and asked us how we were at least three times and enjoyed conversation with him! 

We will definitely continue to visit !

Went there with the family for the first time the other day for dinner--took a minute before anyone greeted us---but since I hadn&#39;t been there before, wasn&#39;t sure how everything worked---basically like other quick service restaurants similar to Panera/Corner Bakery---you order at the counter, they give you a number, and someone brings the food to your table.  I would say the menu for dinner is a step up from the other places I mentioned earlier.

We had the skirt steak dinner, salmon al fresco, 2 kids meals, 2 soups, 3 drinks---and we were out $60---easy.

Flavors were on the bland side for everything.  The spinach for the salmon was more like heated rather than saut√©ed.  The steak was ok but a little on the over done side.  The chili tasted canned.  The soup of the day which was a loaded potato was flavorful but nothing to go out of your way for.

Service was great though.  The bussers and food runners were definitely on point and very helpful.  Maybe will try to go back for lunch one day."

Labriola Cafe isn&#39;t cheap, so the food better be really good. My French dip sandwich wasn&#39;t bad, but wasn&#39;t good enough to justify the price. The coffee was a bit warmer than lukewarm, but not quite hot enough for me.

Maybe the problem was that it wasn&#39;t crowded, around 3 pm. Maybe the problem was that things just go a little downhill over time. Or maybe it was the suggested tip on the receipt after having to order at the counter. (I do tip; I just don&#39;t like being told by the establishment what an acceptable tip is for not much service.) 

I expected better."

During my first visit I ordered a cappuccino and remember only that it tasted pretty good.  This last visit however, I ordered a caramel macchiato.  I know, it&#39;s such a Starbucks drink but when the cashier mentioned it, it just sounded good with the rapidly cooling weather we&#39;ve been having lately.  My first sip and I knew it was a great choice.  It is significantly a lot less sweet than their Starbucks counterpart allowing you to taste the espresso more.  Good stuff.

For a restaurant so large, so clean, and offering so much, it&#39;s a shame the customer service doesn&#39;t match the exemplary level of everything else at this bakery &amp; cafe.

I&#39;ve been here a handful of times now because it&#39;s an excellent meeting spot - whether it&#39;s to grab lunch with a co-worker, coffee with someone for a meeting, or enjoying a donut by yourself... Labriola is a win.

It&#39;s a large restaurant with seating in the front area, outside, and the back room is also full of tables. They have a wood fired brick oven and a ton to offer on the menu. I&#39;ve enjoyed their latte, green tea, The Astoria Waldorf salad, prosciutto and chicken sandwich, chicken noodle soup, and an apple fritter. All were delicious!

You order up at the counter and they give you a number to take to your table (which is open seating). This applies even when you&#39;re just getting a coffee or pastry, however they do offer food to-go. If you come at the lunch hour prepare to wait! The line is always super long. 

Customer service can be quite confusing at times. Every time I&#39;ve been here I haven&#39;t been given much direction up at the counter. It seems as though the staff doesn&#39;t always know what&#39;s going on either. Last time I was in I ordered a donut and they looked at me like I had three heads! It&#39;s a hit or miss if someone will remember to give me a number to take back to my table. Most times I just have to hang around until someone notices I need help.

Regardless, I will be back because it&#39;s a large and lively spot for me to post up with my lap top and work! It&#39;s not often you find a great place with free Wifi, outdoor seating, and that serves coffee, breakfast, lunch, and dessert. Pretty awesome. Now we just need the Labriola team to step it up!"

Mostly, I visit for lunch to order a sandwich or pizza. On a recent weekday afternoon, I ordered the Classic Italian on Sea Salt Ciabatta with chips. The main elements of this sandwich are salami, capicola, arugala, and oil and vinegar. The bread was fresh and doughy, with a crispy crust. The salami was mildly spicy and the sandwich had a moderate amount of oil and vinegar, just enough to moisten the bread. You can&#39;t go wrong with a sandwich or pizza here. I&#39;m sure everything is fresh, flavorful, and meets high standards. 

One minor annoyance to visiting Labriola is the crowds. It seems like the place is always packed. And, since you seat yourself, I always fear I won&#39;t be able to find a table after placing my order. So far that hasn&#39;t happened, but the process of hunting down a table is a small pain here. Because they are almost always busy, it&#39;s noisy here too. But again, the noise and crowds is just a testament to how good the place is."

Anyways, I thought the dine in area would have been better. It kind of looked a little too family friendly with sticky tables and floors which was a turn off. That was my biggest disappointment. I was expecting more of a cafe feel.

Anyways,  the food was great which is the important part. Expensive for a cafe...spent around $40 on food (no service)! Was a little shocked when the lady rang us up. I mean I got a prime rib sandwich for about  $15 I think which isn&#39;t bad...I really got a full slab of steak, but I don&#39;t know where all the other expenses went to? My bf got a calzone and 2 drinks??? $40??? Btw, the calzone is huggge (see my pic). Plus I wasn&#39;t sure if we were supposed to tip the bus boys so an extra few bucks on top of that. 

Overall, the food is good but I was disappointed with the dining area and cost. Maybe I&#39;ll come back for breakfast or dessert because the desserts look really good."

I really wanted to give this place 5 stars but the service was a little off, unfortunately. When I had first entered there had been a bit of a line which was expected - it was a Friday morning. I was only ordering a large cappuccino and a chocolate cake donut in celebration of National Donut Day. I wasn&#39;t expecting to be asked 9 questions regarding size, type of milk, what kind of mug, etc. but I suppose that was nice they cared about my preference. Sadly, when I had ordered my donut I was told they were out of chocolate cake donuts. Alright, that&#39;s okay. Soon after the employee at the register had said &#34;we&#39;re actually out of donuts but we have glazed and the vanilla with sprinkles&#34;....huh? I confusingly ordered a vanilla with sprinkles and stood there for someone to take my credit card so I could pay and take a seat. The man who took my order had just abandoned me for about 9 minutes after I ordered the donut. The line was starting to grow behind me and another employee asked if I was even being taken care of. I don&#39;t understand what happened there. 
Otherwise, Labriola was a really nice place. I had gotten my vanilla sprinkled donut, took a seat to meet Jacqueline B. and my cappuccino was brought to my table soon after. The ambience was nice. The caf√© itself was decorated nicely, clean and the bathrooms were nicer than I expected. The cappuccino was tasty and the donut was soft and sweet - they both looked like &#34;food porn&#34;.

Lots of options here. The most confusing thing is the bakery is to the left inside entrance and the main meal is ordered to the right side of the restaurant. You order separately (or so I was told), you pay, you get a # to place in the stand holder and your meal is brought to you.

I was really craving eggs and bacon so that is exactly what I got. Their two egg breakfast also comes with potatoes and a choice of toast or pancakes. I obviously chose the pancakes. 

The eggs were scrambled and perfectly cooked. Wish the bacon had been just a bit crisper. Potatos were crispy and had peppers and onions in them which gave it a great taste. Pancakes were not as fluffy like I like them but hey, they were pancakes so I defintely ate them. 

Service from the cashier and gentleman who brought us our food was very friendly! Will for sure stop in again to explore the menu once I am back in the area."

So sure, the staff may have made some pretty simple mistakes, but the fact that their tirade included them coming back time and time again tells the story that Labriola has to be pretty awesome, right? Well, it is pretty awesome. 

I had a really sizable salad that satisfied my midday hunger without making me feel too full and bloated. The veggies were fresh, the chicken was tender, and the bacon incredibly flavorful. Topped with house dressing that tied the whole cobb together quite nicely and served at a modest price.

Their many breakfast options, salads, sandwiches and their amazing bakery do not disappoint.  Some bakery items are still pricier when compared to say, Mariano&#39;s, that has a really nice bakery as well.  

The only reason I hold back on 5 stars is because getting a refill on coffee can be a hassle.  They are more than willing to refill your cup but employees aren&#39;t just wandering around to do so and you either have to snag one as they happen to walk by and ask politely for a refill or go up to the counter and get it refilled.  I wish they had big coffee pots like Panera has so you can get your refills yourself right when you want it."

Desserts and bread, labriola never disappoints me. Ive been here multiple times now and this place has always met expectations. 
This review is a mixture of multiple visits. Ive tried like all of their desserts mostly. My person fav so far is their chocolate risotto cake.  
Talking about food, I liked their pizza. My friend ordered an eggplant sandwich which she did not like, but the bread they used for that sandwich was delicious. Another friend ordered a burger and liked it.

She said try the Blue Cheese Hamburger two of us did. We could barely taste the blue cheese, the burger was big and thick and cooked well, the pretzel bun was stale. The toppings were sparse in general. The fries were GREAT. I had a side of BBQ sauce and that was very good for the fries. They had a variety of teas and fresh lemonade (Coke products for soda). They brought vary taste bread to the table while we waited.  I wouldn&#39;t order that burger gain.

I will say we were there around 6.45 on a Tuesday and no wait but a lot of tables filled with families and couples. They had some tables blocked off for a large group. 

The booth was comfy,it was a bit loud while we were there as some people with their kids don&#39;t respect those around them. 

We were there a while sitting, talking and watching the game. They came and cleared our plates and at the end offered us left over french bread to take home.

But as we all know, sometimes things are not what they seem. First time in yesterday and I was incredibly underwhelmed. The food was decent, not great but not terrible. I had the BBQ sliders and a cup of soup. The soup was very bland and the BBQ sliders were just okay. But the worst part, there were nats EVERYWHERE. I went to grab tea from the fountain drink area and got so grossed out at all the nats flying everywhere I couldn&#39;t even grab a drink. I get it, it&#39;s summer and nats are sometimes inevitable but this was slightly overwhelming. Still ate my food and was pretty anxious to leave. On my way out, though, I decided to stop by the bakery for a quick treat. I had the smores bar and it tasted super stale. Maybe just the one I grabbed was bad, but it was pretty terrible. Basically, everything here LOOKS good, but that&#39;s about it. I will most likely not be back, unless someone who I cannot say no to offers to take me and I feel bad about it."

Labriola kind of wowed me today.  My friend, Carrie, told me this is her one of her favorite brunch places.  But I was sure when we arrived, at 11am, that we&#39;d be waiting in an hour long line.  It is Sunday after all.  When we got there, there was a line, but it was moving quickly.  I was so confused as to why until I realized you order first and then seat yourself.  They give you a number and the staff brings you your food.  And the menu is full of classic breakfast favorites(I.e. Toad in a Hole, Belgian Waffles ect.) but not super long and overwhelming.  However, there&#39;s plenty of choices including items from their TWO bakery counters.  

I went with the Eggs Benedict. Aaaaaaand a chocolate covered donut that was the size of a new born and extra tasty.  When the waiter brought my Eggs Benedict, I was already in a food coma from just half of the giant chocolate donut.  It defeated me, I&#39;m not ashamed to say.  Somehow, though, I managed to finish most of perfectly runny eggs.  Their Hollandaise sauce seems to be a little less acidic and a little more creamy than most. Fantastic.

As for the atmosphere, rustic brick, dark wood, fireplaces and lots of comfortable seating make this spot extra cozy.  

The bakery didn&#39;t disappoint either.  I went home with 6 macaroons, all different flavors.  Unfortunately, my 4 and 5yr old &#34;angels&#34; found them and ate about $13 worth of macaroons in less than 2 minutes.  My daughter says the &#34;cookies&#34; were great.  Just lovely."

Lots of variety on the menu with their fresh baked bread the feature. Everyone liked their food very much. Salads,  and sandwiches were fresh and tasty.

By the way, their fries are near the top of my official  French fries meter!

At this restaurant, you order at a counter and then your food is delivered to the table. There are waiters walking around to refill drinks and to clear plates, but you do not order through them. It&#39;s definitely a casual environment with a few TVs playing football games. 

When we came for brunch at 11 am, a lot of their brunch items were out or no longer serving, which was discouraging. I ordered The Breakfast Richie on The Pretzel Croissant, but since they were out of the Pretzel croissant I had to settle for a normal croissant. It was actually really tasty with eggs, sausage patty, spinach and cheddar cheese! I thoroughly enjoyed it and would order it again! My boyfriend got a steak sandwich which he thought was &#34;ok&#34;.. I didn&#39;t try it, so I can&#39;t give you my impression.

All in all, it was tasty but nothing I would go out of my way to seek again!"

Everyone has been here at some time or another and many have long traditions of going here once a week/month/year/etc. The pastries are unparalleled in almost any other bakery (I highly recommend the Napoleon). The coffee is pretty darn good too, and stopping in for a coffee and pastry is a favorite of mine to clear the mind on a frustrating work day.
However, the food is overpriced for what you get. I&#39;ve had at least 5 different sandwiches, a couple salads and a couple pizzas. All have been good, but about $3-$5 more than I could really justify paying for something of that quality/size. Regardless, it&#39;s a classic and a solid lunch option if you&#39;re willing to overpay. You are in Oak Brook. . ."

It&#39;s in a cute little location surrounded by shops and restaurants, and it looks especially nice this time of year with all of the lights and Christmas/holiday directions; perfect for a date night.

There&#39;s a large dessert/bakery section when you walk in, filled with homemade treats. I would have loved to just plop down in front and spend a solid hour eating everything, but I stood strong and moved on.

Now bare with me when I say my order. Just keep in mind that I am inhuman when it comes to consuming food... I was originally just going to order a pizza for myself, which is large, but not outlandish in normal terms of eating. So I go the margherita pizza, but I also noticed on the menu that they were known for their blue cheese burger. And well, I ain&#39;t no punk, so I got the blue cheese burger as well, with fries :) (the look on the servers&#39; faces when they realized this was all for me was priceless)

The conclusion for these food items was very simple for me. The burger was really really good, and the pizza was okay but there are better nearby, namely Antico Posto in Oak Brook, and Pazzi di Pizza in Elmhurst. But the burger was great. The bun was a pretzel bun, probably one of the bigger ones I&#39;ve seen. The blue cheese was more of a cream than it was crumbs but it went really well with the caramelized onions. The fries were kind of soggy but had good flavor. In the end, the burger shined bright this night and everything else was pretty dim.

In short, there are better pizza places in the area, but the burger was great, and the dessert/bakery section looked legitimate enough to assume they would be good as well. I&#39;ll review again once I get a chance to try them out."

Also have simpler Togo options like egg sandwiches and pastries.

One of my favorite lunches is the hearty tomato bisque and grilled cheese on old school Italian bread. Perfect for cold days! 

They get super busy at lunch with people from the local businesses in Oak Brook and DG. But mid-mornings and early afternoon are perfect times if you need a bite and some free wifi without roaring conversations and lines of people waiting on your table"

I like their bread and often buy their pretzel rolls at my local store, but I have to say the restaurant is truly underwhelming. 

The first time I went I had their steak sliders and the steak was tender enough and the bread was soft, but it had no flavor, there was no hint of garlic or onion or even a good beef flavor. It was just bland. 

On the second visit we ordered a pasta dish that included chicken (pasta with broccoli and sundried tomato and chicken) there were chicken bones in the dish. I appreciate the fact that they use rotisserie chicken and pick it fresh, but they have to make sure they get the bones out. When we told the manager that we found bones in our first bit of the food, he said he would tell the kitchen and started to walk away, When I called him back and said that we would like to order something else rather than digging for bones, He seemed surprised but said OK. We then ordered something that could be prepared quickly that actually cost less than the original order. No offer of refund, no offer for a free desert or coupon asking us to return for a better experience, not even any type of verbal apology. in fact he was more looking for praise because he was able to deliver the second order so quickly. 

This wasn&#39;t like we ate half the dish and then asked for more, This was our first bite, We returned a full plate of food, just asking for something that wouldn&#39;t have any bones. 

The restaurant was dirty. It was around 4:30PM and the place was not very busy. As I walked around looking for a table, there were several that were empty but not cleaned off yet. There were crumbs and scraps on the floor. 

We didn&#39;t ask for any money back, heck it was only a dollar, but it would have been nice if they had offered or at least apologized for a potential bad situation. If I had swallowed my first bite I could have ended up choking."

I&#39;ve never had a bad meal here. Yes, it is a little expensive but you get what you pay for. Good food and always fill you up.
Here is a list of some of the items I would recommend:
Filet sliders
Steak sandwich on a baguette
Richie burger
Classic Italian
Strawberry kale salad
Baked rigatoni

I never actually had any of the pizzas but people who I have been with ordered them and like them. They have soda fountain but they usually make 2 different kinds of ice t which are usually good as well.

For those that are interested they do have a coffee and dessert section on the other side of the restaurant. They have it where you can order slices or full cakes to take home with you. I have only had a few desserts here and I did enjoy them. I don&#39;t remember what I had, I am guessing based on my past taste it would have been a slick of cheesecake. 

Staff is great. For an order then sit place the food is really good. I would recommend this place, it is a little bit of a drive from the mall but worth it."

The cookies are also good. (especially the kitchen sink) 

Atmosphere: relaxed and fun. you&#39;ll feel at home in the dining area. 

Service: excellent, when you order in.. It usually doesn&#39;t take long to get your food. And all the servers are attentive.

Food: AMAZING. I have tried entrees from breakfast lunch and dinner. I recommend the French toast for breakfast. Lunch- any of the of the pizzas or pastas are delicious. Dinner- the salads are to die for!!! I always order the spinach salad with salmon. The sliders are also delish

First I time visited I ordered a club on a croissant with a salad. I was a few bites into it and find some strange critter crawling through it. 

They refund my meal, offer to replace it, and gave me a $25.00 gift card to come back and try again. I thanked them for offering to replace my meal but opt to take the gift card and leave since I no longer had an appetite. 

I returned a few weeks later with my wife, 11/21/15 , and I order Eggs Benedict and she ordered Strawberry French Toast with Vanilla. My wife raves over the fresh squeezed orange juice and we are pleased with the aroma and experience. 

After only ten minutes or so, our food arrives. Nearly the same time an employee puts up a 10-12 foot ladder directly behind me and right in front of who seemed to be the manager. 

A few seconds later glass cleaner is being sprayed overhead and this is only the day after her LASIK surgery in the same building. The atomized spray is landing all over us and I&#39;m extremely upset, let the manager know and her response is that she does not understand why he was doing that then. My wife and I find this disturbing as she was present the entire time and had to notice we were extremely uncomfortable when the ladder was first going up.

The restaurant was fairly empty so the smart thing would have been to ask us to move if this was a necessity to clean the bowl at that instant. 

In any case, she gave us a new gift card and needless to say, it&#39;ll be going in the trash as I&#39;ll never visit this establishment again. 

I&#39;m sure emotion has the better of me right now but I&#39;m disgusted with my experiences. 


***Update*** 

After vowing to never return, we decided to give this place another opportunity and we are certainly we did. 

Everything went as it should this time and the food was delicious. Sadly it took many opportunities to get it right, but it was certainly worth sticking with. 

I am going to leave my initial experience but add this to denote that inadvertent and unpleasant experiences may happen, however, they do not have to dictate what the future or past represent overall. 

This business has more than once tried to earn our business and I respect that. They have taken our concerns and addressed them without haste. I am very impressed with those I have spoken with and the quality of the establishment overall."

I became hooked on their salads and desserts, so was eager to try out their actual restaurant location, located right in the heart of downtown Oak Brook, between Oak Brook Mall and Yorktown Mall.

The location is spacious and does have outside patio seating as well. As you enter, you can go to the left if you only want bakery items, or to the right to order meals (to go or dine in). I&#39;ve been here quite a few times since my first discovery and have been pleased with all visits. Depending upon what time you go, it gets quite busy. Weekday lunch crowds usually leave very few open tables or open parking spots (the lot is shared with many other popular lunchtime options). However, even with the crowds, you generally never wait more than 10 minutes for your meal, typically less. But if you&#39;re looking for a quiet zen lunch break, this is not the place for you! 

I feel like I&#39;ve tried a decent selection at Labriola - I&#39;ve ordered their burger and fries, various salads, and various pasta dishes. The burgers seem to get good reviews by others, but I&#39;ll be honest - not my favorite. I found it rather greasy and not terrifically flavorful. I&#39;d honestly prefer a Fuddrucker&#39;s or a BWW burger to these. The pasta is very good, and in particular I am a fan of their red sauce. I&#39;ve had gnocchi, ravioli (on special) and lasagna. All were fantastic. However, my favorite dishes here are the salads. I love the apple cider vinaigrette - sweet but not overly so. The Orchard Salad is why I keep coming back!

Be sure to check out their gelatto bar and their dessert counter on our way out - they have so much to choose from! I&#39;ve tried the macaroons (loved the chocolate, found the raspberry a little dry), the brownies and cookies (both great). And they have homemade ho ho&#39;s that I definitely plan to get next time I visit. Yum!"

To me it&#39;s like corner bakery that presents itself as a little more upscale. White table clothes, real silverware, bread to your table. But then it&#39;s seat yourself after you order and get a number. 

Anyways, I tried their BBQ burger and thought it was very good. The fries were great, fresh cut. My wife had the special salad and it was good with some type of bacon dressing. 

We didn&#39;t get to try the gelato but it looked good and seemed to popular. 

Outside of their confusion of what they appear to be vs what they actual are, is some good food that&#39;s a bit on the pricey side."

Tenderloin sliders- A nice creation with the added bonus of pretzel buns. Having these two in a sandwich combo will keep you coming back. The fries appear to be hand cut and taste like fair fries.

The food is great. 
This time I opted for half a sandwich, California Turkey, and minnestrone soup...so good.

This is a great place to meet with friends for a fun lunch date.

We were there originally to pick up some pastries, but we decided to stay and eat. We found a cozy booth in the back (with direct eye-line to the cake case!) and waited to get our noms.

Husband got the Richie Burger and I got the chicken parm. They were both excellent (I was envious of my husband&#39;s choice - usually it&#39;s the other way around) and well worth the money. Which, by Oak Brook standards, was not pricey by any means.

I look forward to coming back!"

They have tons of seating but our mission was just to get a sugary baked good for evening dessert. Sadly we didn&#39;t find their baked good selection that appealing and ended up empty handed.

As soon as I walked in I went to the bakery display window to browse the selection. I was a little put off by the display of a Stan&#39;s Donut box and their advertisement for the weekend specials. I thought to myself, I go to Stan&#39;s in the city all the time, I came here to try something new. And I also thought, I hope Labriola has something unique to offer and isn&#39;t just trying to re-sell a hot commodity of Stan&#39;s Donuts. After that, I ventured to the cafe area and I wasn&#39;t too impressed with their pastries bc it was a typical selection. I decided on the Bear Claw bc it looked most promising. On the inside, it was filled with chocolate and almond paste. I also placed an order for a Mocha. At the counter, they hand you your baked goods and then it is up to your choosing to sit wherever you like, either in their dinning room or outside on the patio. As I waited I began to weigh the differences between Panera, Corner Bakery, and Labriola as those places are most comparable to the concept of Labriola. What distinguishes Labriola is the very upscale interior design of dark wood paneling and tables, along with dim lighting. Definitely makes you feel like you are cafe-ing on a grander scale. A second point of discomfort however, was the slow service for the coffee. We waited nearly 15 min when no one was in line in front of us. I would have been able to finish the Bear Claw even before our coffee arrived. Now for the taste test, the Bear Claw was flakey, buttery, chocolate goodness! And the Mocha looked presentable, tasted wonderful, and above all was LARGE! Total cost for two Bear Claws, and two coffees was $14. Labriola is a perfect alternative from a busy breakfast restaurant and a great cafe to try."

I cannot rate Labriola as an excellent restaurant because of their lack of consistency.

We&#39;ve had excellent salads and authentic Neopolitan pizzas.  Their breads and bakery items are very good too.  We&#39;ve also had more than our fair share of food and service problems.  The overrated Richy burger is overpowered by the doughy pretzel roll and has always been served overcooked.  Kitchen staff is not careful in reading orders and frequently makes mistakes when I request no onions or no cheese in my order.  Frustratingly, the orders have to be sent back and remade.  It is often difficult to find a clean table.  Dirty dishes are left uncleared long after parties are finished.  When food is brought out, staff always forgets some combination of: silverware, bread, butter for bread, or bread plates.  Managers are not seen checking on their patrons.  Much improvement needed..."

I used to frequent this pizza joint called Pizza Palace in Elmhurst, IL and they served Labriola bread and it was so good. Thus, I was super excited when they opened the cafe.

The cafe is more than a cafe as they have tons of offerings. It&#39;s a bakery filled with fresh baked breads, cakes, muffins, croissants, and cookies. It&#39;s also a restaurant serving delicious foods including breakfast items, salads, soups, sandwiches, awesome burgers, and neapolitan brick oven pizza. Plus, the cafe part - they serve delicious espresso drinks using Intelligentsia coffee beans. That&#39;s a huge plus for me!

I have tried almost everything here and they&#39;re just good decent food. The pizza is awesome and the burgers were fantastic. I also love coming here with friends to just hang out and get some desserts and coffee. When I did a stint of online dating, I kept asking first dates to meet me here. It&#39;s a perfect place for it as it&#39;s just a bit more sophisticated than Starbucks, plus it&#39;s better tasting. If we liked each other, coffee could turn to a meal easily. They probably recognized me there and may have thought  I was a big time slut for coming with a different guy each time. They should have approached me and pimped me out. Girl, bring in the boys and the dough! LOL. 

I lost a diamond earring there once and I was in tears when I realized I was missing one. I called them though I had little hope they would have it. They did! They were so helpful overh the phone and they looked like crazy and found it. I was so impressed because nine out of ten when you made that call, they would tell you that they didn&#39;t have it. I was really really grateful.

This last time when I was in town, I wanted to get my favorite red velvet cake for my friend&#39;s birthday. They didn&#39;t have a full one so I opted for a fresh strawberry yellow chiffon cake. The low note was they didn&#39;t have anybody in staff to write happy birthday on the cake. They didn&#39;t  sell candles either. I thought it was pretty silly for a bakery to not have that available. The girl that helped me made it happen though and was able to write happy birthday on a sheet of chocolate. Good girl.

This place is great, really. Great food, service, and if you signed up for the mailer, they will give you a free baguette that&#39;s really really tasty. Some not so good things are: prices are a bit high; the silly things above with the bakery; and, if you use credit card, they have multiple slots for tips - for cashier, for server, etc. Seriously? How much money should I shell out just for a cup of coffee? That always made me a bit uncomfortable. 

However, it wasn&#39;t enough to not make me not wanting to come back here. I still love Labriola and even though I don&#39;t live in the area anymore, I always try to find an excuse to go once in a great while when in town."

During my last visit, the margherita pizza, which used to be incredibly good tasted bland and kind of like it was reheated after having been left out over night. The rigatoni pasta was nicely cooked, but the sauce was too thick and underseasoned.  The complimentary bread was hard. We had two slices of cake. The coconut cake was too sweet. The yellow cake was excellent, however. I don&#39;t know Labriola, you were the gold standard once, now, you&#39;re slipping.

I love their macarons especially the pistachio ones...droolworthy.  their red velvet cupcakes are yummy as well. Oh and I loved their Nutella Lattes.  Those are great!

Came in around 12:30 on a Monday and was able to order right away.

Got the four cheese tortellini and a cappuccino. Everything came out pretty quickly Cappuccino was a large size but average taste. Starbucks does better which is surprising since this is an Italian place. 
Torts came with a side salad which was actually just lettuce with some dressing..again, average. The tortellini was in some cream sauce, but the sauce was very sparse making the torts taste extremely bland. I was full, but not satisfied.

I came here on a Saturday afternoon for lunch with my mom. It was pretty busy, but that was to be expected. We stood in line and perused the menu. I wasn&#39;t in the mood for a burger or pasta, so I decided on a ham and swiss panini with fries and my mom had a salad. Once you order, your directed to wait in another line to be seated. They do this (I&#39;m assuming) so that seating gets opened up quicker when staff comes by to clean it, freeing up a space for you. However, it can get congested in the standing area, with servers and customers going back and forth. It&#39;s a little uncomfortable.

After about 5 minutes, we were seated and after 15-20 minutes, our food arrived. Unfortunately, I was brought a sad looking cold sandwich. I pointed out to the server that my meal was incorrect. He tried to tell me that it was right, until I noted that it was supposed to be a hot sandwich, aka grilled, not a cold one. He took it back and in a few minutes brought me the correct thing. When it said &#34;panini,&#34; I was kind of expecting the type of panini you get when you go to panera: a thicker, crunchier bread. For being all about the fresh bread, this was a bit underwhelming. It was just toasted white bread. Nothing special. It was falling apart as I was eating it. Also, my fries were almost cold, but they had a good taste to them.

For the price, I was really unimpressed. According to all of these reviews, the burger seems to be a favorite, so I&#39;d be willing to give it another shot and get that. They also have a lot of bakery items, serve Intelliginista coffee, and have craft beer bottles for you, so there are some pluses here. Hope to update this in the future with a better review, but for now, it&#39;s just an average place for me."

Like Panera, there&#39;s a soup and half sandwich combo offered on the Labriola menu. Unlike Panera, food tastes fresh and flavorful. 

I ordered the tomato soup and the hot prosciutto and chicken sandwich, and sat with my laptop in the bakery section (free wifi throughout). I love that there&#39;s 4 different dining rooms, each with slightly differing ambiences and lighting. If you prefer more natural lighting like me, sit in the bakery area by the window. If you like dark mood lighting, then any of the 3 other rooms are suitable. If you enjoy outdoor seating, head outside to the patio where there&#39;s dining tables with patio umbrellas. 

On the left hand side upon entering, the bakery offers a wide array of sweets. To the right, you have your pick of gelatos. Go in a little further and there&#39;s cafe style breads and booked goods as well as lunch/dinner entrees to choose from. I highly recommend the signature burger: the Richie burger. Also on the menu are other burgers, salads, hot or cold sandwiches, soups, and beer as well as non-alcoholic beverages.

The place is good, nothing extraordinary. We tried the breakfast and not the pastry, so my review is mainly on the breakfast. We ordered the crepes with spinach and egg with rosemary potatoes, and the croissant egg cheese sandwich with potatoes.

The crepes was delicious and come with a very tasty white sauce.

The croissant sandwich was just another regular sandwich like any other place. Nothing special here. 

The rosemary potatoes were alright and decent portion. 

Coffee was not the best but ok however the fresh squeeze lemonade was very good. 

This place is ok and might give it another try just to try the pastry and something different on the menu. Price was an average of 10$ per item with no drink."

The manager Jennifer is everywhere and . .She&#39;s friendly, full of energy and accommodating with excellent menu recommdations (salted caramel gelato) and a gracious demeanor that suits this location perfectly!.  If you&#39;ve ever worked in the industry you know her role is a bit like juggling meat cleavers while dancing the pass√© double... and being able to smile while doing it while still finding time to stop by tables and  chat with guests is nothing short of miraculous! 

 I love to look behind the front of the house into the actual prep areas of an establishment and see the staff there smiling while working at their difficult jobs...clearly her attitude is contagious!"

Far larger menu then I expected.  Service was great and even being really busy on a Saturday, the order and food delivery was quick.

Overall the issue was with price.  We did not feel we got a value spending almost $60 for 2 adult meals (typically cheaper lunch options) and 2 kids meals. The Fish and chips was the only item I&#39;d come back for.  We all tried each other&#39;s items and it boiled down to this.

Burger was a large chunk of underseasoned meat with high flavor toppings. If you are not getting all the ingredients in on a bite, you&#39;re left with a boring burger.

Spahetti was al dente but meatballs lacked any real flavor.

Pizza was good.  Liked the crust.  Agreed with 3 year old&#39;s tastebuds. No crazy flavors from the cheese or sauce the might scare a kid.

Fish and chips were excellent.  Large chunks of solid fish with a crispy and tasty breading.  If I was dining with a co-worker I&#39;d get this over lunch.  But I could not see coming back with the entire family."

My husband loves the Twisted Turkey sandwich and homemade chips. The chips are like those potatoes you order at a carnival/fest. The bomb dot com! I always mix it up. Sometimes I will get a wrap, other times a salad. My newest fav is the Cobb salad! SO much food, perfect chopped. My favorite! Oh and get the Greek vinagraitte.

The place is packed. We order at 7:15 and our server says they&#39;re really busy so it&#39;ll be a &#34;little longer&#34; for our food. That&#39;s fine, we are reasonable people. We ordered some appetizers and those came out fine. Cut to 8:20 and we still have no food, just a lot of excuses and promises it will be &#34;right out&#34;. We ordered 2 chicken entrees, a pasta and a salad. Talked to the waitress, talked to the manager..was told they were short staffed in the kitchen. If that&#39;s the case the establish a wait time and stop seating people right away or be up front and let people know it&#39;s an hour wait for food. My pasta was so lacking in flavor I sent it right back and since it was so late I didn&#39;t want anything else anyway. The really frustrating thing was that everyone kept giving us the run around and saying something different. One of us was a restaurant manager and one is a server and we all know this was not normal. 

Since we did talk to the manager I&#39;m not going into many details on this review, but just be aware that their service is really never that great and the food isn&#39;t worth it. They did give a $25 gift card to use but at that point, we honestly should have had a comped bill."

Today it finally happened and why did I wait so long!!!! 
The decor is so nice! SEXY you can say even!
What a hidden gem this spot is! 
The menu was overwhelming because everything sounded AMAZING! And what we had was amazing! I had the Chicago Steak and it was cooked to perfection! The soup that I had was surprisingly good too! It was a Rueben Soup, a first for me! My friend had the Broasted Chicken which she said was great.
Our waiter Brian was AWESOME! Very engaging and just a nice guy, he didn&#39;t feel like he was just serving, it was like we knew him for years! Great guy! 
I&#39;d like to give it a 5 star but I can&#39;t. My only issue Was that the bathroom was right in the dining area, we sat directly across from the partition door to enter the bathrooms. Seeing that was not appealing, you can&#39;t help it, it&#39;s right there in your face. 
But overall - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"

I ordered the pasta in blue cheese sauce with Italian sausage crumbles. It was AMAZING. I cleaned the entire plate. Garlic bread came with (could have been crispier). Had the Broasted Potatoes as my side. Really good, but again need a tad bit longer in over. 

No problems though. Food was amazing. Waitress was very friendly. And hostess even passed by 2 times just to ask if I needed anything. 5 stars all the way."

The place is always busy so depending on the server you get it can be hit or miss for the service. 
The bar area is great and always filled with fun people.  The place is really well decorated and it makes for some good ambiance. It gets frustrating though to always have to wait for a table because I feel whenever we go they are packed. The parking lot I don&#39;t feel is spacious enough for all the traffic that comes either.

I have had nothing but good things to say about Metro and I&#39;ve now eaten here half a dozen times since April so I obviously dig my Metro.  This particular lunch was my first somewhat negative experience.

To start, I will say that the chicken wings were once again amaze-balls and they were the reason we chose metro that day.  My good buddy refused to believe that they have the best chicken wings and sauce around.  He was a believer when we were done!!

However,  I ordered the cream of spinach &amp; bacon soup... D.  This was not good at all.  It was basically just cheesy roux with flecks of spinach and very little bacon.  Needs to be reinvented from the ground up chef!

Also, we ordered the smoked gouda and bacon spinach dip. C+.  Now I can hear what your all saying.... &#34;why would you order the cheesy spinach bacon soup and the cheesy spinach bacon dip at the same meal?&#34;   I hear you and in retrospect it probably wasn&#39;t smart.... however, bad is bad.   They tasted pretty similiar, the dip was a bit thicker and you could taste the smokiness of the gouda, but that is not what was f&#39;d up about this dish.   They layered the bottom of the dip bowl with garlic croutons and then poured the dip over them.    Weird right.  So as you dip the triangle crostini into the dip you inevitably come up with a soggy crouton.   The texture of soggy crouton on crunchy crostini was not good.    Why the croutons?  Not necessary, just dip &amp; crostinis please!

Service was great, the bartender was very pleasant and played along with my friend&#39;s jokes very well.  

I knew I would have an off day at Metro eventually, no hard feelings, I&#39;ll be back soon!"

My personal favorite item is the Lagunitas Battered Fish and chips. Probably some of the best breaded fish I have ever had. It is perfect, and the home made chips are also delicious. 

Come before 6 to avoid a long dinner line, but the service is fast so can get in an out rather quickly. All the servers are very nice, and haven&#39;t found a reason to not come back. The menu has lots of options, and the atmosphere is very welcoming.  Great place!"

I mean, maybe slightly better than most mediocre places. I have been twice... Pretty long wait the second time, for apps and meals. The waitress was lovely but there was also quite a bit of time between giving her our payment and getting my change back. I feel if the food is going to take that long, it better be amazing. My fried green beans were good. My panini was ok... Chicken super bland, and a thick layer of goat cheese...A nice shmear  would have sufficed. My son got chicken tenders that looked straight up like frozen strips from Tyson. Meals are on the expensive side for what you get.

Service was incredibly fast - 20-25 minutes total for a beer and a burger.  Only reason I didn&#39;t give it 5 stars is that it might have been a bit too fast.  I ordered the Western burger which came with onion rings on top. The rings could have used another minute in the fryer.  They were pretty soggy.  The fries could have used some more time in the fryer as well to crisp up.  I ordered the burger medium to medium well, and it was cooked to perfection.  I think between the hostess and my waitress, there were at least 3-4 other staffers that helped me - someone brought me my beer, someone else brought out the food, yet another bussed my table, and someone other than my waitress brought my bill.  Kudos to the management for building a team environment where everyone helps the customer.  Since I had so many people waiting on me, I left a big tip!  :-)"

I had the pork tenderloin sandwich which fed 2 of us. Just a tad overcooked which made the breading hard around the edges but I just cut it off.

Our appetizer of spanikopita, the Greek flamed cheese, was a fun tableside diversion to start the meal; a bit greasy, but the taste, offset by honey and lemon, was novel. The accompanying pita was pretty disappointing, however: really dull to the point of nearly tasting stale. 

The entree of broasted chicken was definitely the pick to make. Like fried chicken without the grease, this was a good interpretation (though my favorite was probably still at Chick&#39;s).

Service was friendly yet professional, and the high-backed booths provide some noise containment (though I was pissed off when an oblivious dad and his little kids were seated right behind us, and a little one started monotonously kicking the back of the booth; I finally stood up and knocked on the top of the booth right over the top of his head. Wake up, genius! The environment of this place really isn&#39;t intended for kids anyway: dim and moody, it&#39;s more for chatty adults to unwind. Go to McDonald&#39;s, Daddy.)

Overall, though, the food is a draw; maybe the hostess just needs to create a kids&#39; section."

The place was packed.  No, wait, we see several open tables.  We asked one of the THREE hostess why people weren&#39;t being seated.  She said that the kitchen was really backed up so they were holding people until the kitchen could get caught up.

While waiting 30 minutes, we saw several take out orders being picked up, all while 12 - 16 people are sitting around looking at empty tables.  Management really needs to get their act together.  Why not seat people and let the know it will be a while for food?  That way they can at least sit rather than stand and maybe even have a couple of drinks?  Or, why not quit taking carry out orders if you are so backed up?  

After nearly 40 minutes of standing around we finally walked out.

If we ever come back again and there is one person waiting we will turn around and leave."

Excellent service - you get someone who is knowledgeable and dare I say excited about what&#39;s good on the menu.  Love their soups, especially the French Onion.  I don&#39;t usually order spaghetti but their meat sauce is the bomb.  The Twisted Turkey was delicious - turkey, stuffing, and cheese on focaccia with a side of gravy and a very small side of cranberry sauce. Soooo good. Plus I had not one but TWO pickles on my plate. I&#39;d go here at least once a week if I lived closer.  Potato ribbons (homemade potato chips in thin pretty ribbons) were unique and tasty too.  Their salads are HUGE."

The first time we went was last Wednesday. First timers, but we were excited for a new place. We started with the mozzarella wontons. Oh my gosh, such s yummy twist on mozz sticks. I had the philly, and was nervous because some places I&#39;ve had a philly at recently had VERY salty meat. The waitress reassured me they cut their own meat in house and it wouldn&#39;t be salty. I&#39;m glad I took her at her word because oh my, it was delicious. My boyfriend had the drunken western burger, and had to have some serious self-discipline to not finish the whole thing. Then on Friday, we happened to be in the area running errands with the kids so we decided to stop in again. This time I had the Twisted Turkey sandwich. It&#39;s basically all your favorite things about Thanksgiving on a sandwich. Even some gravy on the side! This time I was the one practicing some self-discipline to not finish! My boyfriend had the Big Papi burger and again, loved it. The kids: the little guy had a corn dog with oranges. The middle had a plain cheeseburger, and the oldest had the California Chicken sandwich without the mayo. He savored that sucker and finished the entire thing! We will definitely be back again. Delicious!!"

Just about any wrap here is good, but I have trouble ordering anything but the Chipotle Steak wrap. The broasted chicken and potatoes are also amazing, and from now on, I&#39;ll be upgrading my side to the wedge salad with it&#39;s house-made blue cheese and balsamic drizzle. I could probably make that a meal and be content. 

Seeing as this family-owned place has been traditionally Greek, you&#39;re pretty safe with any greek-based menu items (saganaki, anyone?) or the classics, but I tend to stay away from any pasta or odd rice dishes, as they&#39;re usually disappointing compared to my favorites, and way more expensive."

They just finished renovating, so curiosity got the best of us. I wish that it hadn&#39;t. While the decor was surprisingly nice (for Joliet), the food was just &#34;eh&#34;. 

We went for lunch, my mother in law, my one year old, and myself. We were seated right away, in a half booth, toward the back, which was nice. Our server was nice and attentive. The food, was just unfortunate.

I ordered a cheese ravioli, for $10.99. What arrived was frozen ravioli that can be purchased at Jewel. How do I know? I&#39;ve bought the very product at Jewel. I understand that this isn&#39;t exactly an Italian eatery. However, if you&#39;re going to serve frozen food, don&#39;t charge $11 for it, when you can purchase a larger quantity for half at the store. Also, my food was cold.

My mother in law ordered a french onion soup,and was charged extra for cheese on top. The cheese, was a glob of deli cheese. It wasn&#39;t melted, ad she&#39;d felt it was inedible. She&#39;s also ordered a penne pasta, with red sauce. She hardly touched it. She&#39;d said it was very bland, and the sauce didn&#39;t taste like anything that couldn&#39;t be poured out of a jar.

My favorite part was; ordering a lemonade... And getting Koolaid. 

Overall, I felt like the renovations are a shame. Such a nice little place, but dismal food. The meal that cost $25 for the two of us, could have cost less than $10, if we&#39;d made it ourselves.

Oh, and they don&#39;t serve Coke. Pepsi. No Coke."

We had ordered the Chicago steak, the fish and chips, the roast turkey, salads and their french onion soup, and all were very well prepared with generous serving. We had only one waitress, and she split the bill mNy ways without adding a gratuity. So we tipped her well. We will return on our next visit."

The place is recently remodeled and has sharp sophisticated look. They have great beer on on tap I think it was 8-10 to chose from. The best that I sampled was the Kentucky bourbon stout which went great with meatloaf that i had for dinner.  Portions were decent and meatloaf was moist and was set atop mash potatoes . Overall the food was good and the service was great. Recommend for a casual dinner . Dont have many places like this in Joliet that is not a chain.

I don&#39;t know, the best Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich I had was at the Loews Hotel in Phliadelphia (go figure). I still have to find a restaurant here in the Chicagoland area that even compares to it. Anyway, the food and drinks were on average (nothing to write home about as they say). The atmosphere was very hip and modern. The TVs were a little loud and I could barely hear my conversation I was having. I would come back to have drinks and maybe try some small plate entrees."

I&#39;ve been here quite a few times throughout the years and the re model they did a little while back was a pretty huge upgrade. Very nice looking bar area with probably the most comfortable bar seats I&#39;ve sat in. They&#39;ve got a pretty decent beer selection now as well. Some good crafts on tap which I always look for in a bar. Very friendly staff as well.  My only suggestion would be maybe a few more TVs in the restaurant. Love this place.

We were nervous after reading some of the bad reviews here, but after experiencing it, I&#39;m wondering if it was just a bad day for those reviews.

It&#39;s kind of a small place.  Nothing fancy.  I got parmesan crusted chicken, husband got steak &amp; walleye and the kid got a corn dog.  We split fried green bean appetizer.  The fried green beans were WONDERFUL.  The breading had a good flavor to it and they were perfectly fried.  My chicken was maybe a hair overdone, but the flavor was good.  My husband loved the walleye and said the steak was decent.  The waitress was very nice and was good about checking on us/refilling pop/clearing dishes.  The prices were very reasonable.

With the remodeling up went the prices as well. Seems like now you pay for atmosphere.  I can say we&#39;ve had good meals here and bad meals. Seems like the quality of the food depends on the luck of the draw. We order the wraps and paninis a lot and sometimes use the &#34;free sandwich&#34; coupon we get in the local flyer. The quality of the food is never the same twice. Seems like they have a big turnover in staff. Many times we get someone that looks like they are in training. This is not a good sign for a restaurant. Seems that whenever you order something to drink it&#39;s like pulling teeth to get the girl to come back and refill your glass once the food is delivered to the table. I personally liked the place better before the remodel when it was just a little homey restaurant with more reasonable prices. Seems like in their attempt to get big they forgot about what brought people in there in the first place. The food is just OK so don&#39;t expect a gourmet meal. It appears they have a really hard time adequately serving a large crowd when they are busy. The French fries at this place are obviously frozen and dry and terrible. I give it 3 stars because sometimes it&#39;s good and sometimes not.

Very modern looking place. It was a Tuesday night and it was almost full. Took a table right by the door.  Nice music playing and a pretty nice atmosphere.  Was happy to see a pretty extensive craft beer menu but I had to ask for it and the waiter seemed annoyed to go get me one.  Anyway the girlfriend and I were looking for a drink with dinner after work so as she was ordering a glass of wine, the waiter stopped her mid-sentence to ask for BOTH of our ID&#39;s. I hadn&#39;t ordered a thing yet and he interrupted her order regardless.  Now don&#39;t get me wrong, we&#39;re both lower 20&#39;s so I&#39;m not a stranger to getting Id&#39;d, however, at least wait until the orders are placed and in a less annoyed tone.  Anyway this was a theme to the night and really the only reason I didn&#39;t give it a full 5 stars. 

 Everything about the meal was great: First ordered and enjoyed a Lagunitas IPA. Got the chimichurri chicken with a salad wedge and bowl of chicken dumpling. My gf ordered the chicken saganaki. Prices are extremely reasonable. $15 a plate pretty much.  The wedge was outstanding. Very professional appearance and taste.  The bowls of soup were huge and just as tasty. Every time the waiter came by it was a struggle for him to take more than literally 2 seconds to check up. DUDE. SLOW DOWN. The meals were brought out in a fairly timely fashion appropriately after our sides were finished.  The chicken saganaki was lit on fire (traditionally, yet still cool). Both dishes were served with a great compliment of broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots.  The chimichurri chicken had a very unique yet enjoyable taste and came with 2 tender breasts  Just enough bite to not be overbearing.  The chicken saganaki was also delicious and steaming hot.  

The only friendly tone we got from the young waiter all night was when he brought the check, (go figure).  The menu had many good-looking items that I&#39;d love to come back and try.  

TIP FOR METRO: Improve your staff and this place could be great.  Everything seemed rushed and somewhat unprofessional. It seems to be the only thing holding this place back.  I plan to go back to try another craft beer on tap and something else from the menu, but in the back of my mind I&#39;ll be hoping for better service."

My parents love it, which is funny because my dad usually only wants to go to Diamand&#39;s Diner when they &#34;go out&#34;. My sisters were both telling me about their awesome salads, and wraps, and appetizers, etc. My brother, the biggest critic I&#39;ve ever met, said this is one of his top 5 in town. 
First try: my best friend from the city and I came in for lunch and ordered an appetizer to split, and some salads. That&#39;s it. It took 30 minutes to get some damned deep fried green beans and another 30 to get some wilted lettuce with some tomatoes, cucumbers, and croutons. The bill? I don&#39;t even want to tell you because I&#39;m embarrassed that I actually spent that much on a salad and some green beans.
Second try: My dad wanted to take me out after having had a rough couple of months and wanted it to be a nice dinner. I ordered a southwest wrap with steak and it was easily the worst wrap I&#39;ve ever had. The steak was cold, stringy, and chewy. The lettuce was once again wilted. I couldn&#39;t even finish half of the half I started. My mom got the wrong entree sent to the table altogether. 
Third try: This time my sisters insisted on going with me and having me try the something they frequently order, being the buffalo chicken wrap. The chicken was slimy? And, oh hello, wilted lettuce! Long time no see! 

One, two, three, strikes you&#39;re out!"

It was early at 4 and only one waitress was servicing our area. She seems rushed but was friendly enough. By the time we left more help was in. Prices have increased. They seem a bit steep for what you get. Food is always good but not exceptional. We&#39;ve tried many items on the menu. Broasted chicken is one of my husband favorites. New decor is modern and very nicely put together. Was seated in booth directly under music speaker. A bit to loud for me. Wished it was softer music choice.

Anyways, this was the first time I came here.  My husband and I ordered their tacos plate: 3 corn tortillas, one with chicken and one with steak.  Good chicken tacos. I asked for just onion and cilantro. My husband&#39;s was steak with all veggies.  The dinners come with black beans and rice.  Sooo good! Everything was perfectly cooked and moist.

I was enticed by all the positive Yelp reviews of this quaint, no frills, byob, Mexican restaurant.  I had the Carne Tampiquena based on a number of recommendations by our waitress Alex and my niece had the Chicken Flautas.  As stated in many of the Yelp reviews, the dinner was preceded by tortilla chips and a flavorful, spicy salsa.  I could eat Mexican food every night.  Both my niece and I enjoyed our meals and I was thrilled to be able to bring my favorite beer to accompany my meal.  It was good Mexican food and I would definitely go again.  Our waitress Alex was a joy, so friendly and helpful and she even came after me with my bottle opener when I tried to leave it behind on our table.

I think online reviews can be very helpful, especially when they are measured and accurate.  Sometimes it can be hard to determine which reviews reflect these parameters.  There is a review from 1-15-2016 about this restaurant and the reviewer claims they spent &#34;about $80 on dinner&#34; for two and they had the Parillada Montecasino and Chori Fondido (Chori Queso, same thing).

This restaurant has very reasonable prices.  The Parillada Montecasino is for two people and costs $32.50.  The Chori Fondido is $8.75.  Makes me wonder about the reviewer&#39;s math, the overall amount I came up with, even allowing for two orders of Chori Fondido totaled $50.00, before tax.............There&#39;s nothing wrong with writing a tough review, but it is only fair to be accurate when quoting prices.  People do factor in price when they choose a restaurant."

I eat a primarily whole-food plant based diet so Mexican food is a staple for most vegans due to the array of options. As everyone else said DO NOT JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER bc this is truly a hidden gem and worth going 15-20 minutes out of your way to eat here. My mom and I sat down and the friendly waitress welcomed us and brought us our free basket of chips and salsa. At first I was saddened bc I love spicy foods and she brought the green salsa (which many ppl on yelp said was mild). Well boy was I surprised when I took a heaping scoop on my first chip. It was quite spicy  and sooo delicious!! Then, we ordered a small guacamole which was worth the trip alone. YUM! Super fresh and very rich. For our main course we ordered the veggie tacos and vegetarian fajitas (an off menu item, but they will make it at your request). We mixed the corn and flour tortillas and enjoyed every bit of our meal. Food was fresh, made to order and BOMBDOTCOM!

This little hole-in-the-wall is ALL about the food. Don&#39;t go here expecting ambiance or amazing service. Interior is basic, service is friendly.

We started out with complimentary chips and salsa... the chips were standard, the green salsa was finger lickin&#39; good!

Skipped appetizers and went straight to entrees. I had the Steak and Rajas con Crema. WOW. It&#39;s a steak covered in a mouthwatering concoction of poblano peppers, onions, cheese, sour cream, all cooked together with spices.  Uh-maze-ing. The rice and beans are a delicious complement. This dish is one of my new favorite dishes. 

My sister had the Devil Shrimp, grilled shrimp smothered in chipotle sauce, served with rice and salad. Also delicious, but I felt the chipotle sauce overpowered the flavor of the shrimp. 

For dessert we shared a slice of flan. Fantastic flavor, a tiny bit too firm for my liking.  But still a great dessert. 

I absolutely recommend Montecasino for anyone on search of delicious food!"

I would have never picked this place out had it not been for some friends that live nearby and discovered it. The white cursive letters on their front make it look like a hookah place or Mediterranean or something.

But the food... So SO awesome! Marinated in wonderful spices and sauce, the chicken and beef shouts flavor. And pair it with a fresh soft corn taco and the p cilantro and onions, it&#39;s classic wonderful Mexican on a plate! Also, TRY THE GUACAMOLE. Easily some of the best guacamole I&#39;ve ever had: fresh delicious avocado, onions, tomatoes, green peppers, cilantro. I loved all the crunchy stuff in there that boosted its wonderful flavor.

Service was good, our waitress was totally busting her ass, but they are a little short staffed. They should have more than one girl working the floor on a Friday night."

My husband and I stopped in here early on a Friday evening. A few tables were filled. We grabbed a table and were greeted promptly with a bowl of chips and green salsa. They were both delicious. We ordered chicken tacos with green mole and chicken enchiladas with red mole. 

I was very curious about the green mole since I had never tried it before. Both items were delicious. So much flavor. The green was spicy, the red sweet. The quality was spectacular. If I had to pick between the green or red mole, I wouldn&#39;t be able to. They are both fantastic! We also took a slice of the flan to have later in the evening. It had a lovely flavor and smooth texture. 

Our meal here was so wonderful, we are considering going back again within the same week. That is unheard of for us. I know this spot isn&#39;t attractive from the outside... don&#39;t judge it by it&#39;s cover. The food is incredible and the service is warm and friendly."

For the price there are other local places around with better Mexican food. If you already have a favorite local Mexican place, Montecasino probably isn&#39;t going to beat it... but if you&#39;re looking to try somewhere new or in the area Montecasino Cafe Grill is a good option.

One of the big draws for going is that it&#39;s BYOB, and that&#39;s kind of hard to find out in the suburbs.  There is a great liquor store next door with a wide selection of craft beers and anything else you might be looking for."

We were on our way to Yorktown to watch a movie and I was craving Mexican food. We were swayed to go here based of the highly rated YELP reviews. My husband and I shared the Parillada Montecasino (serves two people) and Chori Fondido. Neither of which were good.

It&#39;s small and has about seating 12 tables?  It&#39;s also BYOB , service is a little slow but well worth the wait as the husband is the only person waiting tables and running the register.  The owners are very nice and want to make sure you are pleased."

I was a little disappointed to have a much less than a 4-5 star experience based on other yelp reviews. I ordered the big steak quesadilla &amp; my wife had enchiladas.

It&#39;s terribly cramped on the inside. True, I believe this is just a small space but I believe the way they had the scheme setup made it even smaller so while we waited FOREVER for our meal, we had to sit in a corner.

So on to the food. The &#34;big&#34; quesadilla was pretty normal sized to me. Additionally, I didn&#39;t have any sour creme or anything on the side which is pretty standard for most authentic Mexican restaurants. I could&#39;ve went to Taco Bell for the same thing for $5. My wife was also missing an Enchilada. She was supposed to have 3 but had 2.

I only gave 2 stars because my food was thoroughly cooked. However, I&#39;m not really a fan of this place."

A rather nondescript looking building that shares a space with a liquor store near the Metra station in Villa Park. Once when driving by I made a mental note to look up this place on Yelp to see what it was about. Upon looking it up, I was surprised at all of the five star reviews posted about it so I had to check it out.
Stopped by on a Friday and found it fairly crowded (it&#39;s small inside) with people. Atmosphere is surely lacking. Kind of scruffy if you ask me.
They had one young waitress working that was running around so much I felt sorry for her. She could have used some help for sure.
Here is what we ordered. Shrimp tacos and Carne tampequina, and a horchata.
The waitress brought us some chips and salsa along with water and the horchata. As for the horchata, I did not really like it and think it was made with a mix since the bottom of the glass seemed to be quite grainy.
 The salsa was ok but here is the thing with the chips. They are not made in house. From where I was sitting, I could see into their back room and I saw all of the bags of chips sitting on a rack. I find this very strange that they do not make their own. Its not that they were terrible or anything but they were not made on the premises.
As for the meals ordered, only ok. The tacos had a chipoltle sauce which fought with the shrimp. If ordered again I would recommend their sauce on the side.
As for the steak, it was thin, very thin. Very salty. For almost 17 bucks, it should have been much better. However, I do not want to slam all of their food. The enchilada that came with the steak was excellent. Their rice and their beans were also very good.
I&#39;m amazed about all of the five star reviews. I really can&#39;t understand it. Plus, the prices are not a bargain here either. In my book to get a five star review the meal has to be exceptional or have great service or great atmosphere or a combination of at least two of these or food so good you don&#39;t care about anything else. This did not qualify in my book.

Cheers to all"

That Brittany knows her stuff! Bet she&#39;s glad she gave up that vegetarian rubbish. Amongst the redundant, overpriced, and stuffy chain dominance of the area, Montecasino stands out above the rest. 

Starting with the chips and salsa, the meal was incredible. Both salsas had a ton of flavor and bite. As for my entr√©e, they might have the best mole I&#39;ve had outside of Mexico! This includes Bayless restaurants and ethnic joints in Pilsen and Little Village. The balance between sweet and spice is perfect, with the spice hitting you at the end. Great presentation - the enchiladas were cooked just right. 

Also, the place is BYOB! How many places in the burbs are BYOB?! Maybe more have opened since I&#39;ve moved to the city four years go, but I haven&#39;t found them. When I&#39;m visiting my parents again, we&#39;ll be sure to come here instead of the monotonous chains."

The black beans are a fantastic side! I&#39;ve had black beans that are simply, meh...but their preparation here is delicious!!!

I live so close I can&#39;t believe I don&#39;t come here more often. I SHOULD!!!

My only complaint and it&#39;s my own personal preference is that the horchata tasted like it is flavored with red hotts cinnamon candies. I have heard but not yet confirmed that this is due to the usage of cinnamon oil vs real cinnamon. Although I didn&#39;t enjoy their horchata, everything else I have ordered or tasted here was phenomenal.

This is a BYOB establishment but there is a liquor store next door that has what you&#39;re looking for.

It&#39;s a good place for a bite before heading to the city or just getting back as its nearly on top of the Villa Park Metra on Ardmore.

Accusing me of lying, and furthermore getting agitated by telling me that if the cost of certain vegetables go up, he won&#39;t include them. The veggie taco dinner is about $10, and I have never complained about prices. He goes onto say that he is out of yellow squash and it&#39;s too expensive right now, so there will not be any on my veggie tacos.
 I refuse to go back, especially with the poor customer service and lack of respect for customers. I&#39;ve given them way too many chances."

The few times I&#39;ve been here I&#39;ve gotten the chicken tacos (with &amp; without green mole) &amp; steak tacos. Both were delicious but surprisingly I prefer their chicken over steak. Dine-in and you get free chips and salsa...salsa tastes great on your food as well. The black beans and rice are really good, and I&#39;m not even big on black beans. My husband gets the chicken fajitas &amp; loves it. 
I&#39;ve never brought my own beverage but I know that&#39;s a big plus for some. The liquor store next door is super convenient. 
Finding a good authentic Mexican spot in this area isn&#39;t easy to come across. I&#39;m telling you, come to Montecasino and you won&#39;t be disappointed!"

So, like... this place was kind of awesome. And we never would have found it, if it weren&#39;t for Yelp.

We&#39;ve been on a taco binge.. eating taco&#39;s of all types all over the western suburbs.. even some with small amounts of mole sauce.

But we haven&#39;t been able to find a great dark red/brown mole sauce as a featured item anywhere.

We took our 1 year old grandson here (very accommodating) who was in a mood and made a mess all over the place. We got there at 5:00 on a Saturday and they weren&#39;t busy yet... but that changed as we ate. 

It&#39;s BYOB and there is a fairly decent liquor establishment next door. I picked up a bottle of Menage a Trois merlot, which seemed just about right for the meal except that I was drinking Diet Coke.. so maybe I should have looked for a Menage a Un? 

I don&#39;t think they charged us a corkage fee.. if they did, it was cheap. Because our total bill was under $32.00

Chips served with a delicious green salsa to start out.

I was really occupied with the whole mole idea and never explored whether there are other salsa/ hot sauce options. Shame on me, that&#39;s a &#34;hot&#34; button for me.. so to speak...

Lisa ordered the Chicken Enchiladas with the dark Mole (they call it red, but it&#39;s pretty brown) and the presentation in toto was excellent. As was the mole.. Lisa loves mole sauce and we have been on the prowl for a good one, this is it.

I ordered the Carnitas Enchiladas which amazingly, looked exactly like Lisa&#39;s! (see pictures) 

The mole sauce was almost perfect. A true mole (like this) is almost too thick to be considered a sauce and this was rich and thick, really, really delicious. I say almost perfect, because I like when there is a trace of bitterness in the sauce.

The dinners came with rice and refried black beans..and they did both of them right.... yum.

I also ordered a Carne Asada (Steak) taco, mexican style (to keep with my current fixation) and it was excellent at $1.99.. although, it was kind of a smaller tortilla.. not full size.

At the owners suggestion, I also ordered a chicken taco with green mole (I&#39;ve never tried green mole before) The mole was also delicious but was so thick that it kind of overwhelmed the chicken... I would try this again on a larger portion meal.. like enchiladas. The taco was very good, it just wasn&#39;t the ideal application for my introduction to the sauce.

Montecasino is a terrific find, worthy of five stars for service, quality, originality and value.

We&#39;ll be back. A lot."

I got the taco dinner w/ green mole. It came with rice and black beans. Black beans were yummy, and the rice was just right.
The quality of the meat was good - and you can mix what kind of meat on each taco. I wish it came with more rice. So glad it&#39;s not refried beans. Healthier Mexican food was such a plus! 

The MOLE is not guacamole, ask your waitress and she&#39;ll explain what&#39;s in the red vs green. The red one had chocolate in it, so I went with the green. It was good but different.

I&#39;ll never go to los burrito again, QUALITY over quantity. This place is a hidden gem

Rated 4 stars for the SLOW service, and they didn&#39;t serve seltzer water. Prices are a little hiked too. 

The BYOB atmosphere is pretty rad - reminds me of Chicago. It&#39;s a small place but lots of groups came in and combined tables together. Went on a Friday night."

We went for dinner with on of our kids on a Saturday night. Full house full of happy people. Owner greeted us and took orders. BYOB which we read ahead so we knew to bring some mexican branded beers but there is a store right next store that could help as well! 
We ate the fresh salsa with chips as we waited. Our daughter had a generous plate of nachos with flavorful ground beef, black beans, cheese etc. The home made foods made this a heavenly dish. The generous portion went home and made it to the next day too! I chose the shrimp taco plate so I could try the rice and beans that have been raved about. The shrimp were brined in some spices but not over done and very tasty.  Rice and black beans were for the side portions amazing to taste!   My partner chose two steak tacos Mexican style to experience them the way the owner said is best. They were! He also ate a portion of the nachos.  I am look forward to going back and trying enchiladas.  I do not see us trying the burgers etc because why bother with such great food such as this? Also, plenty of places to sample that somewhere else. 

The place had a full house and we still had excellent service, great food made to order and all fresh tasting.  We were stuffed so we did not check out any dessert options.  Looking forward to going again."

They had a lovely jazz mix playing, salsa verde was outstanding and the guacamole was good. We had tacos - the pork was surprisingly my favorite. The hub preferred the beef and neither of us were over joyed with the chicken, but that&#39;s probably because we don&#39;t really like chicken. 

Rice and beans were well above average and the portions were ample.

I phoned in my order and got the three taco dinner with steak chicken and beef tacos.  The owner greater my when I walked in and had a quick convo while I waited for the food.  I&#39;m a huge fan of tacos and long story short I was not thrilled about this place.  The quality of the meat was great but the mistake they make us using one tortilla, all three tacos fell apart as I grabbed them and in top of that they messed up my order and gave me all chicken tacos"

The chef really takes pride in his food and cares about his customers. I grew up in VP and this restaurant is a gem! It&#39;s right near the Ardmore Metra station and could be a great stop after work or after an afternoon in Chicago. 

So far I&#39;ve had the Nachos with chicken and steak (amazing), Chori Queso which is piping hot, smooth and salty, all Tacos (ground beef and chicken are my favorite), and the Tortilla Soup (packed up to go and had it for 2 weekday lunches).

One note, it is BYOB. There are 2 places nearby to buy alcohol, in case your forget or didn&#39;t see this note before you arrived.  

For those who are gluten-free, everything I have asked about and eaten is GF. I have never had an issue and will append this review if I ever do."

The atmosphere is completely unremarkable, but they do play nice, low key music. The service is a tad slow, as they have one guy running around like a maniac. But, WOW, is the food amazing. We&#39;ll be back once a month, I&#39;m certain."

They have a dining room as well as take out orders. You can&#39;t go back to the standard runny refried beans of other places after you have theirs. They make them with black beans and they are chunky. My favorite are the tacos but their enchiladas are amazing. They have the best tasting salsa! You can only order their guacamole as a large and small(not on your food) because they make each serving right there. Which is a little inconvenient but it goes to speak for the quality of food.

Outside it looks like nothing to write home about but the inside ambiance is terrific.  With low lighting and eclectic European music this is a great place to relax and enjoy some really great Mexican food.
          First off the green salsa that comes with their tortilla chips is one of the best we have ever had. We even bought some to take home!! The horchata tastes great and freshly made as well. My vegetarian taco plate was delicious,  with everything perfectly seasoned. My partner&#39;s steak fajita plate was equally delicious, though the steak was scarcely there. The only other minor mishap keeping this place from getting a perfect score is we never seem to get or have enough napkins.  But this is some of the best Mexican food around, no doubt about it!"

We dared to try MonteCasino after THOROUGHLY reading all previous Yelp (and other) reviews.,..though we were still worried! 
As others stated, we WERE put at ease and made to feel at home by the limited staff.
MonteCasino IS BYOB without snobbery and if you brought tequila, yet no lime they accommodate, offering shot glasses, ice etc.
The green salsa that comes with the 1 complimentary basket of chips was very impressively complex and spicy hot.
Two of us ordered the Chile Rellenos (w/sides of better-than-routine rice and black refried beans) which were marvelously as good and better then many of the other places we have tried. The third diner loved her enchilada plate and when asked for her choice of filling, the server didn&#39;t bat an eye at the request for one of each (no extra charge nor admonishment regarding substitutions).
When selecting deserts with our very friendly server, the chef overheard me say, &#34;yuck! I hate flan!&#34; He humorously exclaimed by the kitchen window, &#34;My flan is THE BEST!!!&#34; (Did I mention this was a small dining room? )"

My favorites are the homemade guacamole...the large is big, it could be an entree, and the tacos, smaller than traditional tacos, but very flavorful.

The owner is usually our sever, and is polite, unassuming, and friendly without being overbearing. 

This is not a fancy restaurant, so if you can overlook the location and inside decor, this is a five star establishment.

The food is fresh, service is strong, taste is delicious, and prices are low for what you get...and the kickers are that it is BYOB and adjacent to another family-owned business, where the employees are beyond friendly and the variety of beers and ciders are amazing...even by Chicago standards.

Dinner for four costs on average about $45-50.

Just one last note, an excellent example of superb service, seeing that I would need a bottle opener for my beer, without asking, the owner swiftly moved to the counter, got one, and opened it for me. Then he left it on the table for me to use. Wow."

After reading several overwhelmingly positive reviews, we found ourselves at Montecasino. Now, we find ourselves agreeing with all of the great reviews that led us there to begin with.
1. LOTS of flavor in every bite of every dish: from the chips and salsa to the rice and black beans, not to mention the great flavor in the steak fajitas and chicken enchiladas.
2. Good pricing and portion sizes: we left feeling full and satisfied and wanting to go back for more another time.
3. Quaint atmosphere and excellent service: we loved the feeling of being in someone&#39;s kitchen while they cooked for us and served each dish with a smile and friendly comment.

The restaurant is BYOB,  which we did, but there is a wonderful liquor store next door (Ardmore Station Liquors) with amazing service, excellent choices of beer, and knowledgable and friendly owners."

To be fair, some of this slowness is what I love about this restaurant. It&#39;s a family business and each meal is cooked to order. If we ever needed anything, once we caught the attention of the server it was taken care of so well. Case in point, my wife ordered a bottle of water and we were told the tap water had a filter. What a genuine touch that saved us a couple of bucks that they could have pocketed.

Love their tacos, salsa, and flan. Can&#39;t wait to keep expanding my choices on such a great authentic restaurant."

This place was the worst Mexican food I&#39;ve ever had the displeasure to consume. Everything tastes and pleated store bought! The chips, the poor grade shredded cheese on my &#34;tacos&#34; the guacamole was so blain I had to mix in hot sauce, salt and pepper; just to even taste it. Honestly the best part of this date was the quality time I spent with my beautiful queen, the bottles Mexican Coke and writing this review as I continue to wait for the waiting staff to approach my table to clear this poor excuse for a meal!

This unassuming little place on the corner of a strip mall like building adjacent to an ugly looking liquor store is a hidden gem. It doesn&#39;t look like much from the outside, and the owners have recently put up some window treatments that make it look even more uninviting, but don&#39;t judge a book by its cover. The reason I gave it a shot in the first place, was due in large part to the great reviews.

I&#39;ve had three experiences here in the last few months. The first was dine in. The place is very clean and the ownership couldn&#39;t be more inviting. Overall service was great, but the real rockstar of this place is in the kitchen. This little place churns out some of the most authentic, flavorful Mexican dishes you&#39;ll ever try. My last two experiences have been carry out, and the quality and consistency has not wavered.

I really hope this place succeeds and stays around for many years to come. If you&#39;re in the area, be sure to stop in or call ahead for pick up. You&#39;ll be glad you did.

Little did I know that BD perfectly fit that description. I had the Chilaquiles. Comes with a thin steak, eggs and tortillas. Fantastic! So flavorful. The most expensive breakfast item at $8. My wife had the house skillet w/ pancakes (yes, I ate those) at $5. Also outstanding flavor and value. Service was great. Only improvement could be the coffee - which was OK but not special.

No expense was spared when putting it together.  Definitely not what I expected for a restaurant in the suburbs.

We had reservations at 7:30 pm on a Thursday night.  When we walked in we were greeted promptly with smiley faces.  The restaurant was pretty empty at that time.  According to our waiter, we just missed the wave of diners.  

We dove right into our meals as we had the 8-course tasting menu. Apparently the the food here is locally sourced, fresh, and everything but the butter is made in house.  

There wasn&#39;t an official menu so it&#39;s hard for me to be too descriptive...and it&#39;s hard to be descriptive when you wait too long to review, nearly a month.  Please refer to photos.


Amuse
Scallop crudo - light, refreshing and delicious

#1)
Charcuterie - pretty basic

#2)
Arugula salad - I think this had tuna.  I felt that it was a little to fishy tasting.

#3)
Gnocchi - good but not memorable

#4)
Whitefish - this was served with wild rice and some type of mushroom.  It was good.

#5)
Lamb Sausage - It had a great taste but didn&#39;t have the wow factor.

#6)
Steak - I don&#39;t remember the cut of meat so of course I defaulted to steak.  The was by far the most bizarre tasting dish with a little with too much.  If I can remember correctly it was the steak in a charred wedge, beef jous, a creamy ranch like sauce, and pickled relish.  Too much.

#7)
Cheese - cheese and toast meh

Sorbet palate cleanser

#8)
Churro Ice Cream - my favorite of the evening!

Overall it was a great experience primarily because of the wonderful and attentive service.  The food was just good.    Earthy and rustic.  Would I make another trek out there?  Why not?"

I was excited when a group of us were going to get together and Vie was suggested.  Vie hit it out of the park with food, service and even the ambiance.  I love that they use seasonal ingredients and the dishes truly reflect that approach.

Service was excellent from start to finish.  The bartender was friendly and helpful in choosing a cocktail to start.  The Spring Bringer was wonderful.  Our waitress was also helpful in offering recommendations and really took care of the table. It was a busy night and she even brought a taste of two white wines for me to taste to make sure I&#39;d like it. They were also excellent handling my husband&#39;s nut allergy.  Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu noting that he couldn&#39;t have the romesco sauce with the steak and went one step farther in saying that it would still be delicious even without the sauce. 

To start, I had the scotch egg appetizer which was amazing. I also has a taste of the gnudi and the lamb which were also equally delicious and perfectly cooked. We also ordered some chicken liver pate that came with some preserves on top.  I am very picky about pate usually not caring for the texture.  My husband loves this because it usually means more for him. Not this pate. The texture was so smooth and it was very flavorful. It was one of those situations where we needed more toasted bread to get every last drop. 

The table also shared the beet salad and I think the Vie salad.  The beet salad wouldn&#39;t have been my first choice and to be honest, salad is not normally something I get super excited about. But WOW!  I didn&#39;t know what some of the ingredients are, like quark and chickweed (still don&#39;t really) but everything melded together perfectly.  The salad also had a nice balance of different textures.

For the main, I ordered the fish - I am pretty sure it was the sturgeon. It was flaky, moist and delicious. My husband ordered the sirloin steak sans the romesco sauce.  It was cooked to the perfect medium rare and was very tender. The potatoes and jus were a perfect complement.  The other dishes looked equally mouth watering.

Dessert was also very good.  We split the Gentleman Prefer Blondes (brownie type dessert with gelato), Taste the Rainbow (sorbets), and the Doughnut holes. I only wished I had saved more room for dessert!

Overall, Vie exceeded my expectations and I can&#39;t wait to go back. It is so good that I would fight the bad I-290 traffic that I try to avoid (or better yet, you can take the Metra - very close to the Western Springs stop)."

We are disorganized and do not take birthdays particularly seriously, and therefore waited until 9PM to try to make a last minute 9:15 reservation. My boyfriend reserved on opentable, and noted that it was by birthday and could they please bring me a margarita and tiramisu with candles if those were on the menu (in the real world, making special requests with 15 minutes is so unreasonable. We had zero expectations).

He received a call 3 minutes later from Vie, making sure that we didn&#39;t make the reservation by accident for that same night - and letting us know that they just seated their last reservations for the night. We said no problem! We&#39;ll come back another time. The lady replied that no, we would be coming to Vie tonight. So sweet.

We showed up and sat at the bar, and were served by both bartenders - both amazing and knowledgable servers that made this night memorable. The menus said &#34;happy birthday&#34;, they served up complimentary champagne, and then made me a super delicious margarita (I am a discerning margarita consumer. These people know what is up.) We had the Vie Salad (so simple and excellent) and the chevre gnudi (amazing). We also shared the burger (excellent, and the house made pickles were the best part.) I also ordered a mule, that came with a surprise hint of mezcal, and was extremely delicious. Brad ordered a &#34;dealer&#39;s choice burger wine&#34; and was blown away by how good it was. We also got a number of other delicious specialty aperitif-esque shots.

One of the bartenders, Julius, spent all night chatting with us about favorite Chicago restaurants, whiskeys, and telling us about the rest of the menu (this ensured that we will be back). I also got a happy birthday donut hole and ice cream dessert, which was apparently inspired by tiramisu. This is the kind of restaurant where they remember every detail about you - yet the prices do not reflect the extreme level of service in my opinion. Such a steal for what we got.

The decor in this place is stunningly beautiful but also inviting and warm. We got so much more than we expected during this magical evening. Thank you Vie! We will be back so soon!"

We were welcomed by a very friendly and knowledgable waitress (i forgot her name). She helped us order our drinks, and I ordered their signature cocktail.
We had the 5-course tasting menu - started off with bread and butter and then an amuse. Next for our 1st course, we had ravioli with some kind of sweet barbeque sauce? We liked it the least. Next for the 2nd course, I believe we had cioppino. The shrimps and fish were a little overcooked and salty, but it was still delicious! 3rd course, we had strip loin. The loin was beautifully cooked, medium rare, juicy and savory. We were already full after our 3rd course. 4th course was fruit and nuts crostini with a slice of brie cheese and jam. Before the final course, we had a pre-dessert of a small scoop of raspberry sorbet. Then the final course was chocolate mousse. We were very full, and it was definitely worth it. Hands down the best restaurant in the suburbs!"

Everything from the food to the service was excellent.  It&#39;s a remarkable restaurant tucked away in Western Springs and definitely worth the trip.

With so many seemingly delicious menu items, it may have been difficult to decide what to order for my entr√©e.  Then I saw the cdk ranch beef combination.  Two kinds of hearty meat on one plate?  You don&#39;t have to tell me twice.  I thoroughly enjoyed that wood-grilled strip loin and barbecue beef.  Some delicious marinated summer vegetables rounded out what turned out to be the perfect order for me.  As is usually the case, my now fianc√©e ordered a more delicate dish: the pan-roasted walleye.  It too was an excellent choice.  Rounding out our meal was an absolutely heavenly seasonal ice cream. 

The lighting, decor, and relatively quiet atmosphere made for a wonderful ambience.  Our server was friendly and attentive, and she made sure our meal progressed evenly.  Needless to say, it was a truly enjoyable dinner!"

I can now (with integrity) affirm why Zagat has given this excellent, first class (yet not presumptuous) establishment TOP RATINGS for service and food.
Finally, the mixologists at Vie are the best in the business! None of the top restaurants my wife and I have been to in Chicago and the suburbs have topped a single drink my wife and I have had every time at Vie!

We enjoyed the overall experience but thought the food fell short of what&#39;s expected of a top 40 restaurants in US.

I made the reservation only a few days ahead based on weather forecast. Arriving right before 6 on a Monday night, we were seated in an empty dining room. By the time we left (after 7), the room was full and a couple tables were also occupied in another room (this restaurant is bigger than we initially thought).

It was my first Restaurant Week experience anywhere and for some reason I thought one could order off the regular menu too. Silly me. Not much a meat head, I chose mushroom and sunchoke tart, shaved carrot salad, pan-seared rushing waters trout, and a dessert with blueberry (I had no idea what the French word on the printed menu means but blueberry and meyer lemon sounded good to me); my meatier half chose roasted chicken sausage, creamy tomato soup, wood-grilled pork loin and the Sundae dessert (not listed in the online Restaurant Week menu). He also decided to do a beer pairing for an extra $20. There were a few a la carte side dishes priced under $20 each but we decided not to splurge too much. 

We finished most of our four courses with little problem since they were well-portioned and not heavy/greasy at all. He liked the pork loin, said chicken sausage was fine, but the singular wow factor for him was the cheddar crouton in the tomato soup. Totally unexpected and absolutely delightful. The grilled fennel accompanying the pork loin was tough. I am not very sensitive to fish smell but a slight fishy smell hit me when my entr√©e was brought to the table. I like most fish including trout but somehow found myself wishing for a fattier fish while working on the good-sized filets. The salami bits were very tasty. My dessert reminded me of a deconstructed yogurt and granola parfait, not the decadent ending I was hoping for, e.g., cr√®me brulee custard cake from last year&#39;s Restaurant Week menu. The lemony wild blueberry jam could make a killer blueberry pie filling though. 

I am glad we tried the four courses and $44 per person is quite a bargain but honestly I am not sure if we would order any of them again, except for the cheddar crouton. Perhaps I am just too lowbrow to appreciate the delicate flavors.

For the beer pairing, each pour of the four beers was about 10 oz, starting with a couple refreshing pilsners followed by two heavier ales (the last one from Six Point Brewery in NY, different from online menu). He drank slower than he ate so I unselfishly lent my help in crucial moments. Even though I am new to beer and food pairing, I would say it elevated the dining experience. 

Service was attentive and prompt. The decor is elegant yet relaxed. Though I would like more space between tables, they aren&#39;t too close to the point of discouraging intimate conversation. Stepping outside, I was enchanted by the historic water tower under the night sky.

Considering Restaurant Week is hardly the best time to judge a restaurant&#39;s quality, I am not sure why Vie lost its Michelin star but I certainly hope it will get it back. It would be the closest Michelin to us that isn&#39;t rubbery."

Now with that being said I was a bit nervous going to Vie, I was scared that I was going to commit some dining faux pas. When my husband I got there we were 20 minutes early for our reservation, yet the hostess was able to find us seating right away, the staff was phenomenal and very warm, Stephanie was super attentive and she put me at ease. We did the CRW menu. We had one of each item, and I did the wine pairings. The food was not as intimidating as I was I thought it was going to be, this is a good thing for me. It was plated beautifully, the flavors of each dish were familiar, but better. For example the French onion soup with the fried cheese curds and giardiniera, it was a nice Midwestern hug from the inside. Everything was exceptional, especially that last wine pairing with the apple bread pudding, and for the life of me I cannot remember what it&#39;s called, but it was great. 

Thanks Vie!"

My boyfriend brought me here for our anniversary and we both left feeling very special from the experience that we received at Vie. He had made the reservation on Open Table with a note on his shellfish allergy. I was very impressed when the waiter brought up the allergy with his introduction, acknowledging that there would not be an issue with any of the food we order touching any surface that touches shellfish. 

We were surprised with a salmon crustini brought to us compliments of the chef. It was crispy, smooth, and the asparagus on top added an element of freshness that we both enjoyed. We ordered the gnocchi with oxtail as our appetizer - very good! It was the perfect size for two. I had the chicken as my entr√©e and it was AMAZING! I could not be happier with my choice! The fresh apples, spaghetti squash, chicken, and chicken sausage worked wonderfully together and I could not stop saying how good it was. I was pleasantly surprised by how hearty the portion was too! My boyfriend had the goat and said that it was some of the best goat that he had ever had. We both enjoyed the carrot cake baked Alaska. The carrot cake was delicious and the meringue dollops were a fun play on an old dish.

The service was PHENOMENAL! Everyone that we encountered was extremely hospitable and attentive. Our drinks were always full, they were quick to offer more bread, and were very helpful with our questions on the menu.

I would definitely recommend this great find for your next special evening. This gem in the suburbs has everything that you are looking for in a nice night out."

We arrvied early in order to try some of the cocktails they are known to be very good at. They were really well prepared by the one mixologists that chose to acknowledge us. And he got tipped very generously for that. 

 &#34;Faculties Inverter&#34; and the &#34;slow wide turn&#34;  (i think that was the name) were prepared skillfully and were delicious treats to start the night.  We got bar tender snubbed after the first guy handed us a cocktail menu and then made a couple of eye contacts. ...

The other dark bearded gentleman, who already acknowledged us and that we&#39;d be ordering..........then acted as if he didn&#39;t hear me say &#34; I  think we&#39;re ready to order some drinks&#34;. We were  dressed up, being polite, but got embarassed with my date....so  I didn&#39;t appreciate it. I know the bar was packed, but there was contact made and ignored.

For any of you that know this, you KNOW he heard us but chose to act like he didn&#39;t. .....but a younger clean cut bartender saw us standing and waiting;;;;;;he came out from behind the bar, walked over and took our order.  (whew!)

 

Now shifting to Dinner:   courses were all very good. 

The later protein portion courses were quite generous in size. 

Our server was Stephanie ----and she was excellent at light chat, wine pairing explanations and describing the flow of the evenings courses. The decor of this place is clean and contemporary modern and if you enjoy that style you&#39;ll like the design here very much.

The waitstaff and bussers were pretty prompt, moved innocuously to set and clear each course, and my girlfriend always likes to joke with and chit-chat with this often under appreciated part of the night.  I think they were surprised that we took time to acknowledge them and make a fun night of it.

They had forgotten to serve a course and that had our server scrambling to make up time; and then another time there was a looooooonnnnng lag betweeen 2 courses. It was a very busy night, I understand that. However, if they are trying to get that Michelin Star back, well then.....................details details details. 

The deserts were a little disappointing; there was a cheese course served with a pancacke that tried to be gourmet in some way--- but was just way over-oily. I had a desert involving a spice cake as the majority of the dish......it was dry and unimaginative. I took a tiny bite of it, scraped at the sauces and poached pair pieces and left it. The blueberrry sorbet to cleanse our palates was just OK. but we assumed these were more funcitonal &#34;palate cleansers&#34; and weren&#39;t designed to impress.

That said, there&#39;s many things that make a great night of fine dining. I love that I didn&#39;t have to pay 20 bux to park, we both got  great imaginative cocktails, a sharp good bartender canceled out a rather snobbish one.  our service was professional and fun, and the food was great......deserts needed some work."

Chef Virant&#39;s food is truly amazing with his own unique spin on everything. Furthermore, Bret, our server was informative, attentive and personable (the others who tended to our needs were also very pleasant). The attention to detail, whether it be the food, service, menus or decor, is incredible (ex. the menu&#39;s were personified to acknowledge the birthday). The kitchen was kind enough to send not only an amuse-bouche but also a really wonderful dessert for my sister with birthday well wishes written on the plate. Hats off also to the pastry chef (desserts are heavenly) and rest of the kitchen staff, sommelier, bar tenders and hostess. 

In summary, Vie can best be described as a fabulous place to enjoy a memorable evening of true haute cuisine with none of the pretentiousness."

It&#39;s one of those restaurants I love, fancy dance, ya know? We went on a Tuesday, unplanned, drinking champagne and celebrating nothing. Another lovely night with my bearded man. We went late winter, early spring. Parked on the street, and greeted sheepishly by the hostess. Why of couuuuurse we have a reservation.....A bit stuffy, but rich people like that stuff. 

The decor is modern American, with clean whites and gorgeous leather boothing. 

The food is beautifully explained, served, presented. One must eat deliberately, to appreciate the nuances of the plates. An artful experience.  

Taste if you can."

My family has supported Vie throughout its ten years, and I have to say, tonight&#39;s dinner was truly special. A great way to celebrate ten fantastic years! Menu breakdown:

We started with an amuse-bouche of scallop ceviche with some corn and other vegetables. It was very refreshing, and a great way to start off the meal. For my first, everyone at my table chose the fried quail. It was delicious--crispy fried exterior, with very tender meat. The buttermilk-chive dressing on top was also very good, and it went great with the arugula.

The next four courses were absolutely outstanding. 

For my second, I had the roasted beet salad with peaches, candied pistachios, and house string cheese. WOW, this salad was spectacular! The peaches were incredibly juicy and sweet, as were the beets. Together, they made a really sweet-earthy combination that is out of this world. The cheese added a nice layer of richness, and the candied pistachios not only were delicious on their own, but added another layer of earthiness to the plate. One of the best salads I&#39;ve ever had.

For my third, I had the crispy Parisienne gnocchi with local mushrooms. First off, Chef Virant&#39;s gnocchi is probably my favorite item at Vie, and this certainly did not disappoint. The gnocchi were just a tad crispy with a very creamy, but light inside. Love eating these guys--the perfect blend of light and satisfying. The mushrooms were also amazing--so rich, salty, and delicious. An umami bomb! The wood-grilled bread with the ricotta was also a nice touch. A very, very good dish.

For my fourth, I had the wood-grilled hangar steak. This steak was so delicious, wood grilling really brought it up a level. The b√©arnaise sauce on top was so necessary, and it really complemented the saltiness and meatiness of the steak. The red onion hash like mix underneath the steak and potatoes was SO GOOD. I don&#39;t even know what it was, but it was incredibly rich and delicious. Wow! I also tried a bite of the sturgeon, the other option for this course, and it was delicious as well. Vie always executes their fish perfectly, and this was no exception.

For dessert, I had the molten chocolate cake. I was super excited to see this item on the menu. Molten chocolate cake is my favorite dessert ever, and usually the chocolate cake at Vie (at least whenever I go) is always cold. Tonight&#39;s cake was perfect. It was dry and cakey on the outside, but completely hot and molten on the inside. The cocoa nib tuile was awesome, and the coffee ice cream really went well with the cake. A very solid dessert, one I wish they served more often! Up there with my other favorite, the peach consomm√©!!!

Anyway, my menu breakdown for the 10th Anniversary dinner was rather long, but really, it was a spectacular meal, and worth every penny. For $80, you get five amazing courses that truly show what Vie is all about. We had just one minor hiccup in the meal where our desserts took a particularly long time to come out, but our waiter apologized profusely for this, and we used the extra time talking with Chef and the wine coordinator. Overall, I can&#39;t wait to come back--here&#39;s to many more anniversaries!"

My date and I decided to celebrate a mutual unbirthday last night at Vie. They had a special offering in celebration of a favorable Gayot recognition. Being an adventuresome sort; I thought &#34;why not&#34;. The offering consisted of three courses plus an amuse bouche. Each course had a wine pairing. I chose roasted quail, roasted Arctic char plus what was a cinnamon bun with a cranberry reduction covering. Each course wine pairing worked well although the Spanish red with the char was a surprise! Not bad, but would have  been more pleased with something else. I thought it was a bit crisp at the start although the finish was quite smooth. The service was outstanding with an extremely well informed and attentive staff. While it&#39;s not a place to hang out, I plan add Vie as a place to visit again."

Honestly, if you haven&#39;t been to Vie...now&#39;s the time! Yes, it&#39;s worth the trip from the city, from the north burbs, from anywhere. The service is beyond fantastic and just thinking of the food makes my mouth water.

I went to Vie this week for Restaurant Week and had the best meal I&#39;ve had in quite some time! My favorite thing about Vie is that they treat each customer as if you are the most valued VIP at their restaurant and you receive truly impeccable service. 

My friend and I ordered a ton of food and there was not one thing we didn&#39;t like. We shared the Restaurant Week menu plus five special sides (yes we know we&#39;re gluttons). I love that Vie does special sides each year that aren&#39;t on their usual menu. Our waiter, Jimmy, timed out the meal to bring out our sides very meticulously and we appreciated his thoughtfulness. Vie really knows how to cater to their clientele and snag new customers that will be devout for life!

On to the food!

I swear there is crack in their bread &amp; butter. Vie starts you off with two small slices of bread with butter and I wanted a million pieces of bread but had to cut myself off! 

Creamy Three Sisters Polenta, braised beef ragu, parmesan cream, pickled garlic $9 - Huge portion and so reasonably priced, wow. I love polenta and this polenta was so great with the parmesan cream and pickled garlic dashed throughout. I actually had this for dinner tonight because the portions were so surprisingly huge, I ended up with a ton of leftovers. It was just as great 3 days later as it was Tuesday night. It simply left me wanting more of it!

Cream whitefish brandade, wood-grilled semolina toast, pickled corn relish $8 - This was my friend&#39;s favorite dish of the night. I must admit I was a bit hesitant when he insisted on getting this but it was fabulous. The bread has a smoky taste from being wood grilled which added so much to the dish. The creamy whitefish brandade paired perfectly with the pickled corn relish, fiesta in my mouth! I wish the brandade would have had something added to thicken it just a tad as it ran off the bread after the first couple scoops.

Stroganoff: Beef meatballs, local mushrooms, creme fraiche, dill pickles $13 - My personal favorite of the night! The noodles in this were so thick and dreamy, the meatballs, though small, were packed with a punch. The whole dish was such an interesting take on a classic. Do not pass this up if on the menu! Vie make this an entree and offer it full time at the restaurant. It&#39;s amazeballs!

Growing power spinach and leek gratin, cheddar, black truffle butter $8 - Oh yea, you taste the truffle butter in this. I love me some spinach and this is hands down the best spinach I&#39;ve ever had. It was served in a mini casserole dish and I highly recommend this if you catch it on their menu!

Chef&#39;s selection of two cheeses, pistachio rye toast, seasonal preserves, micro greens $12 - If you know me, you know I have an obsession with cheese options. If I sit it on the menu, I can&#39;t help but order it! I wasn&#39;t big fan of the pistachio rye toast as it seemed like fruit cake to me. It was served nice and warm though! If that&#39;s your thing, I&#39;m sure it was awesome. The two cheeses were succulent, especially the creamy cheese...loved it!

Confit gunthorp farm chicken thigh, split pea puree, roasted carrots, house cured olives, meyer lemons (Restaurant Week Menu) - Such moist delicious chicken. This was a first course and a huge portion! Seemed much more like an entree that a starter.

Cream of celery root soup, preserved peppers, smoked sturgeon, saba (Restaurant Week Menu) - Definitely had a bit of kick to it! Woo! I enjoyed this soup thoroughly, absolutely loved it. 

Local pork combination: breaded and fried loin with sausage, lentils, braised onions, orange mostarda, pickled asparagus, pork jus (Restaurant Week Menu) - Another very solid, great dish. 

I don&#39;t think there is a better restaurant in the Chicago suburbs. The great thing about Vie is it&#39;s great for date nights, family nights, out with friends, any occasion. Why in the heck did they lose their Michelin star!? Vie is even better than it was last year and they best get that star back next year!"

One of the few suburban spots to be blessed with a star (that of course  has since been taken away)?  I was excited.  I think the focus now is on the other two spots for chef as the food was just not up to where I would expect a Michelin place to be.  We sat right by the fireplace, which was very nice.  The decor in there looks dated but in a way that it doesn&#39;t look intentional.  There is a larger bar area and I could see hanging out there often if I lived in the area.  The service was decent but they did not have a sommelier, which I thought was a bit strange.  It was a Saturday so I certainly expected one.  Their wine list has literally a 4x markup.  I expect 100-200% in the city but this was far more than what you normally see, especially when there is no somm.  One good thing about the service is one of my dinner companions was pregnant and they were very accommodating.  They even split the scallop appetizer onto two plates so that she could have well done scallops and the plating on both was still on point.  One general statement is the portion sizes were far too large.  

We started with the scallops, foie gras, and charcuterie.  The charcuterie was average.  The scallops were not diver scallops so they were quite tiny.  The sauces that accompanied were solid though.  The foie was pretty good though.  I got the skate wing and it was soggy.  This is unfortunately something I have come to expect as very few places are able to get a nice crispy exterior on skate.  My husband got a pork dish, which was solid.  My friend got a sausage dish that came with fried giardiniera.  That was the standout for sure.  I could eat that everyday.  Overall I was expecting more although if you are in the burbs it is a solid option."

The meal started with an interesting wild rice gnocchi amuse bouche; our appetizers were a wonderful quail with an agra dolce (sweet) sauce and a wood fired chard tart which was nothing short of amazing. Entrees were an Arctic Char with excellent accompaniments and a plate with goat, goat and more goat including terrific goat sausage. For dessert I had a stone fruit tart in a white chocolate crust - a perfect ending.
Wines/champagne by the glass were available in the $14-$16 range and were exemplary. A very good yeasty bread is served and refilled as needed. Very good service on all counts.
We sat at probably the worst table in the house: all the way in the back next to a partially open drape to an empty space but it didn&#39;t deter from the enjoyable dinner."

The food was excellent, the table service was very good, the decor was modern, yet tasteful, and the hostess must have been in training.  

Unfortunately we were seated next  to a group of empty nesters who were loud and were more suited to be in del boca vista!

We started with the wild mushroom and duck confit appetizer,  then proceeded with our walleye pike and Arctic char entrees,  and finished with scoops of creamy salted caramel ice cream and chocolate sorbet.  

No gripes on the food-- high levels of balanced flavor and texture.  

Service gripes-- there&#39;s really no need to fill my water after every sip!  Our waiter&#39;s visits to the table didn&#39;t fit with where were in our meal.   Finally, when a customer leaves your establishment after dropping some $s,  look them in the eye and say thank you.  The hostess barely got a good night out.  

Nice, but we won&#39;t be back."

Asked the bartender for something with whiskey and ginger, standard these days but what he served was AMAZING! Watching him assemble the drink was awesome, so many artful and creative steps all leading to a delicious concoction of flavors and with an unique presentation. 

I then proceeded to order the Vie Salad, which honestly was the best salad ever. It was simple, fresh and very enjoyable. I ordered the white fish which was also great. The fish was perfectly cooked and the presentation, again was amazing. The sides that came with the fish were also excellent and the dish was a very good sized portion.

And finally, the best part, dessert. I was served a strawberry sorbet to excite my pallet and then a new item on the menu, the Blueberry Boat. I love dessert and this was one that exceed all other previous desserts. It was a piece of art on a plate, that in addition to its awesomeness, was incredibly delicious! It was comprised of whipped valrhona  chocolate, blueberry sorbet, hazelnut brown butter cake and yep, more blueberries. The &#34;boat&#34; was a chocolate shell and all the components were laid on top and around it. Words alone cannot describe how tasty of a treat this was. While I was throughly enjoying my dessert, the bartender, assembled another masterpiece to compliment the flavors of the dish. It is so cool that the bartenders are in sync with what is going on and can be so creative on the spot. The drink was excellent.

I will be going back to Vie the next time I am in the Chicago area. If you are thinking about going, you should; you will not be disappointed. Chef Paul and his whole staff are wonderful. The restaurant atmosphere is relaxed and everyone is very friendly. Five stars for Vie."

Each dish was wonderful, especially the appetizers (we got the semolina gnocchi with squash blossoms, pan seared scallops, and wood grilled asparagus, with a chilled cucumber and chevre soup).  Everything had unique, delicate yet simultaneously bold flavors that melded together perfectly, with the most memorable being the soup that was chilled with cucumber yet came with quite a spicy kick.
In terms of entrees, we had the slow roasted pork belly with morcilla sausage, and lamb loin with merguez sausage, both very solid, but weren&#39;t quite as exciting as the apps.  Maybe we enjoyed the spicy surprise of the soup a bit too much and looked for other flavor surprises everywhere else.  We topped it off with the &#39;what&#39;s black and white and red all over&#39; for dessert, which was a perfect capstone to the night.

Parking - Readily available.

Service - Was great! I just felt our server was pre-occupied and wasn&#39;t as knowledgeable about the food. Nevertheless, he was still a nice and polite guy.

Ambiance - Lovely decor, low noise level.  Only thing is the tables are pretty next to each other.

The food - Great! Just felt everything was perfectly cooked - the sauces and puree are very well thought of. Could add some more options.

Bar Scene - Well paired options available - also, they offer a wide variety of bar menu.

My only criticism is that the place needed to do something around how the food was served - it lacked that upscale feel but was still good and won&#39;t stop me from coming back."

He paced the meal perfectly, brought out champagne and later cheesecake, and took time to explain any questions we had about the menu. 
We came out to celebrate out sixth dating anniversary but they treated it like wedding anniversary. They printed congratulations on the menu and brought out congrats items mentioned above. 
We eventually settled on the gnocchi, the panzenella, and the halibut. 
Gnocchi was fluffy and served with rabbit and bacon. 
Panzenella was made with fresh crisp croutons and an assortment of vegetables. 
Both dishes had us using bread to soak up the extra sauce. I would highly recommend both dishes for their combinations of salty and sweet as well as fresh ingredients. 
For our entree we split the sea bass which was nicely crisp on the outside and tender inside. It came with root vegetable and fresh zucchini bread. Crispy outside lead to a moist and warm inside. 
Lastly we ordered the peach pies for dessert which came warm with ice cream. Winning combo. The waiter also brought us a pice of cheesecake for the anniversary. We could not finish it. 
The only item I would rethink is the cocktail I ordered. The sense inverter (wrong name?) was described like a  manhattan but more like fruity punch. Should have gone with wine. 
Overall quality food and excellent service for prices far below average in the city. I would recommend a train ride out for this one."

We are looking forward to another visits soon!"

My experience at Vie was unparalleled. We had:

wood-grilled scallops, sweet potato puree, spicy gensis growers dried pepper romesco, charred meyer lemons, pickled green beans ($19) - heavenly, melting ambrosia. I highly recommend this if you like scallops or sweet potatoes. I love both so for me, this dish was incredible. Highly recommend this. The sweet potato puree was creamy &amp; rich, perfect texture. Scallops were flawless.

ball things - amuse bouche, delicious, even though I&#39;m blanking on the name lol.

scotch egg, chicken confit, werp farm braised parsnips, preserved garlic vinaigrette ($15) - complimentary, courtesy of chef Paul Virant :) Loved it. If I was a cat, I would&#39;ve purred, but alas, I am a two-legged beast and settled for making silly &#34;ermagawd SO GOOD&#34; faces. A scotch egg is a &#34;soft cooked hen egg, wrapped in chicken sausage, then breaded and fried&#34; according to their menu.

wood-grilled slagel farm pork porterhouse, forbidden black rice, wood-grilled little gem lettuce, preserved grapes, pistachios, pork ragu ($35) - this menu was so fun haha. Forbidden black rice &amp; pork ragu?! Count me in! I couldn&#39;t eat all this, but even the leftovers were delicious. The forbidden black rice lived up to its fantastical name, lots of flavor. I could eat the rice alone as a meal; it was that good.

wood-grilled vie burger: slagel farm 21-day dry-aged beef, grafton village 2-year white cheddar, house-made bacon, fried local mushrooms, bread &amp; butter pickles ($16) - the best burger that I&#39;ve ever had. Juicy &amp; flavorful. Toasted buns. Cohesive taste where the first bite was just as good as the 2nd and 3rd. The fried mushrooms weren&#39;t like the standard fast food fried shrooms. These were lightly battered, but maintained an impressive crisp. Incredible and on par with the burger.

St. Louis butter cake ($10) - My close yelp friends probably know by now of my sweet tooth haha. I&#39;ve seen butter cakes on food blogs, but I haven&#39;t tried it yet, so my curiosity was piqued. It came out in a mini cast iron pan, a lovely caramelized crust on top that reminded me of creme brulee almost, but better. Dense, rich, and a perfect sweet ending to the feasting.

jam jelly cube - palate cleanser. Yum :D

The food was amazing, without a doubt, but the service was outstanding. Our waiter was friendly and well-informed about the menu, attentive and helpful with suggestions. The maitre d&#39; checked in on us several times, even bringing over a complimentary appetizer sample. And chef Paul Virant came over to our table and checked in on us with light conversation. Soon afterwards, we received a scotch egg appetizer courtesy of chef Virant! I&#39;ve never had that level of service, even at places where it was more expensive per person, $40-60 without drinks. My experience at Vie reshaped how I view the dining experience, and I can&#39;t wait to take my family there, 5 stars all the way baby!"

2. menu tries too hard 

Maybe I am not comparing Vie to the right restaurants.  Seems like the menu tries too hard.  Maybe we just caught them at an odd time of year.  If we go back, it will be to enjoy the mixologist&#39;s creations and appetizers."

Although we didn&#39;t have Inigo Montoya for a server this time, we had an equally wonderful Pablo. He took his time and explained about all of the delicious foods. He even brought out a &#34;Happy Anniversary&#34; dessert!

At the end of our meal, Pablo asked us if he had served us before and we told him that Inigo Montoya had actually been our server before and he laughed and said &#34;that was you who wrote the review?&#34; haha! Apparently everyone know about that review.

What can I say? I&#39;m famous! :) Thanks for another wonderful meal, Vie!"

The ambiance is wonderful (reminded me of the Violet Hour).  We started off with a nice glass of champagne and a lovely cheese plate.  After that we both ordered off the special menu for the night.  My husband had an aged steak and I had the halibut.  We both thoroughly enjoyed our choices.

Our waiter was terrific - he was extremely knowledgable without being pretentious and did not rush us in the slightest. We were already talking about coming back and bringing our friends."

The six course prix fixe dinner with optional wine pairings is an experience like no other.  From the opening oyster duo with champagne to the Tahitian vanilla cremeux with tokaji dessert wine, the entire evening is an incomparable treat.  Service is always polished but Stephanie&#39;s enthusiastic explanations of both food and wine add a sparkle to the evening!  Do yourself a favor and give Vie a try."

I tried to get different things from my bf so that we could try as much as possible. For the first appetizer course, I got the shrimp and he got the pork belly. My shrimp was okay but were a little chewier than I prefer, but his pork belly was amazing. We also added an order of scallops, which was interesting but a tad small.

For the second salad course, I got the roasted beets and he got the vie salad. The beets were okay and the ricotta biscuits added a nice touch of richness. But neither of us could finish the salad. It was just way too salty and sour, as if someone had spilled salt and vinegar on it. This course was the most disappointing.

At this point, I was getting a little nervous, but the rest of the food did not disappoint. For the third main course, we both got the pan roasted whitefish, since I could not bring myself to get the chicken, which as the other alternative (I don&#39;t think chicken is usually worth it at fancier places). This, my friends, was delicious. The skin was a tad oversalted, but it was perfectly crispy and it enhanced the mild flavor of the fish. The texture of the fish was flaky and moist yet well cooked, and the rice complemented it well.

Finally we finished with the last dessert course. I got the chocolate mousse bar, which I loved although it could&#39;ve been plated more prettily. The bottom crust was like a kit kat bar. I couldn&#39;t finish it because it was super rich, but rich in a good way. My bf got the sour orange float and that was only okay, although it didn&#39;t excite me. I took a few sips to try and didn&#39;t really want any more (the chocolate mousse on the other hand was hard to put down even when I was already full).

Overall, lovely meal, although everything was a little saltier than what I prefer. The beginning was a little questionable, but Vie won me over with the main course and the dessert. Service was wonderful and I loved how elegant the space was.

TL;DR if you&#39;re here for R-week, get the 1) pork belly, 2) roasted beets, 3) whitefish, and 4) chocolate mousse. Trust."

The place is a lot bigger than you would think looking on in from the outside.

All around the food is delicious but does not have that extra &#34;oomph&#34; for a mich star. The passed bread was good but I did not think it was as great as all the reviewers raved about.  

Only downside is that the wine list is on the pricey side...for a location in the suburbs I thought it was a little much....but was able to find a wonderful Italian wine for under $60.

Why I waited so long to go to Vie is unbeknown to me. ((Perhaps it&#39;s my laziness of having to drive to Western Springs??)) 

Everything about Vie was impeccable. The food. The service. The ambiance. I&#39;m almost at a loss for words with my experience. I loved the simple, chic, and classy elegance of the decor and ambiance. Our waiter was exceptional. He was extremely knowledgable and provided countless recommendations and insight into dishes. The service in general was flawless. 

The food, by far, was what was most rave worthy...

Appetizers
//Local russet potato gnocchi, braised burgundy snails, green garlic, pickled fennel, local carrot puree
//Pan-seared sea scallops, spring pea and preserved orange puree, smoked pork braised ramps, spring radishes
//Cream of local butternut squash soup, preserved squashes, candied walnuts, wood-grilled croutons

::The gnocchi can only be described as eating a potato flavored cloud. It was light, airy, creamy, and f&#39;ing fantastic. We opted to go sans snails, which may or may not have been a good thing. The combination of the pickled fennel and carrot puree was incredible. What more can I say? My bf totally digs the scallops. If he had it his way, he would have ordered 3 of those dishes. I opted to forego trying these as I have never liked scallops. The butternut squash soup was to die for. It was extremely creamy and savory. The candied walnuts and preserved squashes another layer of sweetness. As for the croutons, you could taste the grilled flavor seared into them. Perfection. 

Entrees
//Wood-grilled Vie burger: Q7 ranch 21-day dry-aged beef with Wisconsin cheddar and bacon, house made tater tots, pickles
//Local spinach and Prairie Fruits Farm chevre herb tart, smoked apple butter, roasted onions, green garlic, roasted garlic vinaigrette, watercress

:: Vegetarian dishes like the spinach and chevre tart make me more and more happy with my decision to go meat-free. Normally, I wouldn&#39;t give this sort of dish another glance on a menu. However, it was one of the most decadent and savory dishes I&#39;ve encountered. The creaminess of the warm, melted cheese with herbs was to die for. Literally. Add a touch of the apple butter with a roasted onion, and not only have you died, but you&#39;ve gone to heaven and back. Twice. 
I was feeling somewhat meaty and decided to give my boyfriend&#39;s burger a try. ((After all, I can&#39;t say how great it was if I didn&#39;t try it, right??)). It was the best f&#39;ing burger I&#39;ve ever sunken my teeth into. It was cooked perfectly. The cheese and bacon added an extra gluttonous, but delicious, touch. Let&#39;s not forget the homemade tater tot squares - love at first site//bite.

Dessert
//Orange Marmalade Sorbet with Langue de Chat

::This was my least favorite dish. The sorbet and langue de chat ((cookies)) were delicious. I could have done without the marmalade with pickled orange rind. It was slightly bitter for my likings. 

The one disappointment I learned about Vie is that what their menu is on the website isn&#39;t what they&#39;re serving that day. I made that mistake thinking I was going to gorge on one thing, and arrived to find they change their menus daily. Needless to say, I&#39;m clearly not disappointed in my experience. 

Vie is hands-down one of the best restaurants in the burbs. ((Obviously since it did receive a Michelin star.)) I anticipate I will have many more visits to Vie in my future.   It&#39;s nothing short of an exquisite and elegant experience."

I had no idea what to expect and I cannot compare it to other restaurants of the same caliber.

~Ambiance: light blue walls, elegant chandeliers, romantic
~Staff: Our waiter was AMAZING. I&#39;m sad to say that I do not know his name, but he is a tall Chilean guy who is also the sommelier for the restaurant. He was friendly and so passionate about the restaurant/food/wine and made excellent recommendations for us. He definitely knows how to cook and could describe/explain the dishes to us. 
~Food: Delicious. We had the lamb and gnocchi and also a meat/cheese appetizer and both were amazing. I had a red fish on a rice cake, served with swiss chard and it was very good. We tried 3 different desserts and they were all wonderful...my favorite was the chocolate ganache cake with popcorn ice cream!! Yes. Sounds gross, but it was amazing. 

Overall, it was a very nice experience and I left full and satisfied."

I did not go to a ton of restaurants. In fact, I only went to one but one was enough. Vie has been on my list for quite some time and Restaurant Week was the perfect opportunity to satisfy my curiosity. 

We were a party of four. Some of us (me) might have been eyeing the menu for weeks. When I arrived, my mind was set on one thing: FRIED CHICKEN. Yes, Vie is a Michelin star restaurant. No, I didn&#39;t want the fancy pants white fish served with a coulis of something or other. I WANT FRIED CHICKEN! Imagine my disappointment when I sat down to find that the fried chicken entr√©e had been changed to grilled chicken. Gasp! For a moment there, I really thought I was going to lose my shit but I calmly asked the server what the deal was. He assured me that it would not be a problem to do a fried preparation. Yes! Fried chicken all around! 

After the roller coaster of emotion I experienced over the fried chicken, I was ready for a drink. I wish I could remember the name of the cocktail I had. It consisted of gin and some sort of cherry liquor. I just remember that it was delicious and made me forget about the fried chicken debacle. We decided to get a couple of the special starters/sides to share. The cheese plate was presented with a goat cheese, soft blue cheese, pistachio grain bread, honey and chocolate raspberry jam. It&#39;s kind of hard to eff up a cheese plate but I will say the soft blue cheese was absolutely wonderful. We shared the egg salad with fried bread - totally delicious and the fried bread was reminiscent of a fried wonton. 

Ok, the restaurant week menu. I opted for the crispy pork belly starter b/c this gal loves her some pork belly. I mean, I LOOOOVE it. If I could make sweet love to pork belly all night long, I would but it&#39;ll never happen b/c I&#39;d eat it all before I could even get to first base. What? Anyhow, the pork belly was cooked perfectly...crispy, rich with the right amount of fattiness. It was served with potatoes, sopresseta and a vinaigrette. Next up was the roasted yellow beets served with farm greens and ricotta biscuits. Simple, but so delicious. 

Finally, the fried chicken. I have to admit I was a little disappointed that the breast was boneless vs. a bone-in breast of chicken. It was still quite tasty but when I think of fried chicken I think of picking that sucker up with my hands and digging in. I suppose Vie is not really that kind of place. I mean, you won&#39;t find plastic bibs or wet naps on the tables. The fried breast was served over braised thigh meat, greens, au jus and the best mashed potatoes I&#39;ve probably ever had. 

You&#39;d think this would be the end of my review, but you&#39;d be wrong. We still had the dessert course. The sour orange float was really tempting me but I could not pass up the warm gingerbread doughnuts. They were little bites of heaven and something I&#39;d order again. 

We opted for the wine pairing - totally worth it. The moscato with dessert was damn good as was the pinot noir with the main entr√©e. Service here is truly stellar...as it should be. All in all, a great meal. I would not hesitate in coming back to Vie for a special night out. Who would have ever thought a Michelin star restaurant was nestled in downtown Western Springs? Definitely worth the checking out."
vie-restaurant-western-springs-2,Vincent C.,ixu__F_BGWNW1BC2uZ1xhQ,"Evanston, IL",1,1,0,27,1102,-pd_q4FcstaVmynG5_Ooeg,3.0,2012-07-03,"I was really excited to eat at Vie and I enjoyed my dinner, but I don&#39;t feel like I need to go back. I wasn&#39;t disappointed, but I also wasn&#39;t moved at all. Should a one-and-done restaurant own a Michelin star? I&#39;m surprised that it even has one. And quite frankly, I&#39;m sick and tired of the farm-to-table shtick. I get it, if a restaurant isn&#39;t rotating through a seasonal menu and isn&#39;t serving local game, it&#39;s not worthy. Alice Waters opened Chez Panisse in 1971, it&#39;s not such a fucking novel/revolutionary idea anymore. But I digress, the food was hearty, rustic and delicious, I was just hoping for a little more refinement.

My wife and I each had the 8-course tasting menu; everything we ate was on the √† la carte menu, so it&#39;s more of a sampler. Had I known this (we were told the progression was going to be a surprise and left to the whimsy of the chef) I would have ordered off the menu.  The cooked temperatures of the proteins varied pretty greatly: I had a medium rare sweetbread, my wife&#39;s was medium, I had a steak cooked to medium, while my wife was served one that was medium rare. We didn&#39;t ask for different preparations, so what&#39;s the deal? I think the veggies definitely outshined the meats, and there were jams/preserves/pickles that popped up in each course and were always a nice treat. Meat is boring and pass√©.

The service was friendly and adequate, probably a little sloppy. I get the restaurant is casual and laid back, but that doesn&#39;t mean water needs to be spilt everywhere whenever my glass is being refilled. Why am I getting clean silverware before my plate is cleared? I&#39;m also pretty certain that if a server has to ask the top secret Michelin reviewer what he/she is having before serving the plate, Vie wouldn&#39;t have that one star. I&#39;m being a little critical on this point because 1) we were a party of two, and 2) my tasting menu is a surprise, I don&#39;t know what&#39;s next. However, little details like these do matter because eating experiences aren&#39;t only about the food. Yeah, I might come off like a snob, but if a restaurant is going with that pretense, execute it.

I was hoping this trip to the western burbs would have been more rewarding. I think there are a lot of restaurants like Vie in the city, maybe not as decorated and hyped, but just as good."
vie-restaurant-western-springs-2,Aimee M.,RO3vznPVVw5NWcgfP3k17A,"Chicago, IL",1,1,0,365,1433,AOaAyQGP7ZzoHgDCuY-jyA,5.0,2012-02-19,"It&#39;s been a few days now, but I&#39;m still basking in the glow of the fabulous dining experience my friends and I had at Vie. People say that restaurant week brings out the mediocrity in restaurants--not so at Vie.  In fact, I felt like we were special guests. Service from beginning to end/entering until leaving was top notch.  

Our foursome decided to stick with the 4 course RW menu, adding on the suggested wine pairings for each course and also adding on an extra starting course and cocktails.  There was also pieces of warm bread brought to us individually throughout dinner.  It was hard to say no but you can tell the bread was freshly prepared.  Very addicting. 

Cheese plate with goat cheese with chocolate raspberry jam, soft blue cheese  with honey and Pistachio Grain Bread.  Simple yet so delicious.  Egg Salad with fried bread.  To quote Dina B--&#34;It&#39;s probably going to be the best egg salad in the world&#34;  and it certainly was.  Well prepared, light and so fresh.  The fried bread was almost like a fried won-ton, but not greasy at all. My cocktail of champagne with an orange liqueur went perfectly with the starters.

Crispy Pork Belly, braised potatoes, Sopresseta, Olive Vinaigrette. Just a few ingredients but also so well-made.  The Pork belly was well prepared, just enough fat to add richness and the olives gave it a nice season without having too much salt. This was paired with an Italian Sparkling White and it went perfectly with the dish. 

Roasted yellow beets, Werp farm greens, ricotta biscuits, walnut vinaigrette.  I love beets and this was a refreshingly simple salad, yet so colorful and flavorful.  The Ricotta biscuits were like fried bread, but so soft and puffy from the ricotta. The pairing of the 08 New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc was perfect.  I am no means a wine expert, but this wine to me was the best of the evening.  Crisp, light, aged well. The color/clarity was perfect--I will have to find this wine for my own private stock.  I tasted a bit of Ericka A&#39;s course--Grass Fed Beef/Caesar salad and found that absolutely delicious as well. 

The next course was braised chicken with braised greens, potato puree and a chicken au jus.  My friend Joanne w, noticed the change on the menu right away even though we had been stalking the RW menu for weeks.  The online RW menu said fried breast, while the Vie menu listed Braised.  Dare we ask about it?  Our waiter Dan, so easily said he&#39;d ask the kitchen and right away reported back they would make the fried breast for us. Delight and squeals from our table (yes, that was us).  The meal was delicious.  The chicken was tender, the au jus was well seasoned and the potatoes--magical. Just these simple ingredients elevated to a heavenly level.  The pairing with Pinot Noir--again perfect. 

Dessert choice was the Seville Sour Orange Float.  I love the orange creamsicle taste of this, but it&#39;s def on the sour side for sure, so take heed if you&#39;re considering it.  The matching wine pairing was a very sweet moscato, a bit too sweet for me, but I&#39;m not a fan of sweet wines anyway.  The other choices of warm gingerbread doughnuts and the chocolate mousse bar were also very lovely. 

I cannot say enough about the stellar service.  The space is very sleek and decor is minimal, yet the wonderful food and excellent service makes Vie very warm and inviting.  

5 stars easily."

It&#39;s the only way I will be able to afford to eat here again short of selling a kidney on the black market. It was a fantastic experience, both enjoyable and delicious from start to finish. Vie proves that preparation and presentation can make all the difference in a dish. There were a few ingredients that I don&#39;t normally like, but I tried them and actually loved them!

Joanne W. made reservations for herself, Dina B., Aimee M. and me on the first night of Chicago Restaurant Week 2012. We carefully studied the restaurants and their menus and decided Vie was one of the best deals and a great way to indulge. We showed up ahead of schedule and they seated us immediately. I admired the modern, simple yet elegant decor and was very pleased that our table was large enough that we never felt crowded.

We started the night with cocktails. I took our waiter Dan&#39;s recommendation and went with the Manhattan. I typically dislike Bourbon, but I found the drink quite smooth. I also opted for the $20 Wine Pairing for the Prix Fixe. The first glass (09 Russolo, &#34;Jacot&#34; Tocai) wasn&#39;t my style, but I thoroughly enjoyed the two reds (the second was 09 Healdsburg Ranches, Pinot Noir) and could have easily finished an entire bottle of the Moscato D&#39;Asti.

As much as I love wine, I loved the food even more. I&#39;ve always been a person who thinks spending more than $40 on a meal is completely frivolous, but I&#39;ve also been to very few places where both the service and food were consistently outstanding and justified the price tag. We had two choices for three courses and three choices for dessert. They also provided us with a specialty side menu, so we started by polishing off every piece of bread they brought out and ordered the Cheese Tray with a hard Goat Cheese, soft Cow Blue Cheese, honey, raspberry/chocolate jam and warm Pistachio Grain Bread. We split the Potato Salad as well.

- FIRST COURSE: Pork Belly with Potatoes, Sopressata and Cured Olive Vinaigrette.
The pork was seasoned well with just the right amount of fat. I really liked the greens on top and found that I actually like olives, at least their olives. They weren&#39;t overly salty and the acidity didn&#39;t detract from the meat. I wish I had an entire tray of their Sopressata.

- SECOND COURSE: Newly added $8-extra Caesar Salad with Grass-Fed Beef. 
It was easily the most flavorful, tender and lean beef that I have ever had. The dressing wasn&#39;t overpoweringly fishy and the toasted croutons were a nice touch.

- THIRD COURSE: Chicken Breast with Braised Leg &amp; Thigh, Braised Greens and Potato Puree.
We were especially excited about this as they had originally listed it as breaded and fried, so we were very sad to find that they had changed to a grilled version. However, they graciously accepted our request to fry it and it came out perfect! It was very juicy with a light breading that wasn&#39;t overly greasy. The Potato Puree was like butter.

- FOURTH COURSE: Gingerbread Donuts with Sweet Custard and Warm Apple Compote.
Cider Donuts can&#39;t hold a candle to these. Warm and soft. The Custard and Apple Compote only help to enhance the flavor."

This visit though, not so good.  The service was lovely and the ambiance was perfectly comfortable.  The food was really, just okay.

Other than the cheese plate and the endless refills of bread, there really wasn&#39;t anything memorable served.  The dishes lacked depth and the tastes were fairly bland.  There wasn&#39;t much effort in the presentation either.  Michelin really can&#39;t be wrong about this place, can they?

Go for the experience if you&#39;re looking to take advantage of their Restaurant Week menu.  However,  I heard they have other events often and perhaps, that time would be a better chance to experience the only Michelin rated restaurant in the suburbs."

Vie is a beautifully decorated restaurant with exceptional service. Which made for a ridiculously romantic night.

I must note- I appreciated having some space in between us and the neighboring table. Having lived in the city for quite some time, I always loathed having to hear the person&#39;s conversation next to me and vice versa. And difficulty squeezing through to get up.

I felt that the waitstaff was extremely observant and attentive. The wine that accompanied each course for the wine pairing came right on time. The water in our glasses were always full and I always felt satisfied.

I came here for Restaurant Week so I wasn&#39;t expecting Vie to be on its best game. I was terribly wrong. Every course that came out was amazing. From the laughing bird shrimp and pork belly appetizers all the way through the Valrhona chocolate mousse bar with soft caramel and salted peanuts! I am drooling just reflecting back on my dinner experience there.

Crossing my fingers that I get the opportunity to come back again when I am in town! Thank you Vie for creating such a memorable night!"

Honestly, not being from Chicago I don&#39;t know the owner/chef but I kept hearing he was a local up and comer.  

First impressions...the space is elegant with clean lines and just the right texture and tones.  But then you realize its a bit like a cool loft that has been decorated as the model unit to sell others.  Nice, but lacking its own character.  

Service - above par!  Bar staff was great and generous w/ their tasting pours.  Everyone that we interacted w/ clearly understood the expectations of service at their place of business.  

Now here&#39;s where I was not impressed.  Food - ok.  Started with the cheese plate.  It was fine but not better than I do myself when I go to whole foods.  Just not memorable.  Then, we were recommended to try the fish puree.  We smeared a couple tastings on some toast and that was about it.  Strange texture, like they put a fish in a blender.  I like interesting foods, but this just did not taste very good.  Lastly, we split the pork belly.  It was pretty good.  A bit over cooked but all in all a good dish.

Overall, if this were a 3 star place or local dive, i would say pretty good food, but after ready the reviews and hearing the hype and then trying the fare, I would say...You peeps in the burbs need to get in to town once in awhile.

We had a good experience and I was happy we tried it out and would even go back for drinks again but I think my 3 stars is fair taken in total."

I came here with my gf for restaurant week on Wednesday night at 8:30pm http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/56ZqV7bmT_yuKhR795-HPw?select=wXorpow-bsf3FSbA7iUHDA.

1. Scallops with carrot puree and crispy chicken skin http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/56ZqV7bmT_yuKhR795-HPw?select=41fkx1Ym12QLe9lroDQExw
Okay. Scallops were okay, and I didn&#39;t think the puree and chicken skin added much. Presentation was also disappointing.

2. crispy local pork belly, 
braised potatoes, sopressata, 
house cured olive vinaigrette http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/56ZqV7bmT_yuKhR795-HPw?select=KE5zSZUUUpFar36RDjq81w
~Delicious. Best dish of the night. Pork belly was crispy and wasn&#39;t fatty. Potatoes were cooked perfectly, and the olive vinaigrette complemented nicely. Tad oversalted.

3. wood-grilled laughing bird shrimp, 
roasted carrots, pickled oranges, 
smoked paprika vinaigrette, cilantro http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/56ZqV7bmT_yuKhR795-HPw?select=84YA7DwoaF_EY4A5ltARzw
~Pretty good. All the elements complemented the shrimp nicely.

4. roasted local beets, werp farm greens,
ricotta biscuits, walnut vinaigrette http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/56ZqV7bmT_yuKhR795-HPw?select=FoiC0f2J1X9lRSpy7poVeg
~Mediocre. Beets were okay, and I didn&#39;t really care for anything else. Ricotta biscuits were more like fried ricotta balls.

5. Vie Salad -local greens, fresh and marinated hearts of palm, garlic and herb vinaigrette, and parmigiano-reggiano http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/56ZqV7bmT_yuKhR795-HPw?select=-2qlkKrMzihJWY9Vf4Grfg

6. pan roasted whitefish, anson mills carolina gold rice,
fried hazelnuts, braised onions, gremolata http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/56ZqV7bmT_yuKhR795-HPw?select=q2Y2UPAwbnabnbl7lic0gA
~Mediocre. Whitefish was borderline undercooked, skin was way too salty, and there were two bones in my fish. Other components didn&#39;t help.

7. valrhona chocolate mousse bar, soft caramel, salted peanuts http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/56ZqV7bmT_yuKhR795-HPw?select=hJanjE7cN4FCAJxwroNlJQ
~Okay. Mousse bar was pretty good, but the soft caramel was sloppily added to the plate, and I had no idea what the white cream on the side was (whipped cream?). Whatever it was, it didn&#39;t help the dish.

8. seville sour orange float:

vanilla bean ice cream,vanilla wafers, soda http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/56ZqV7bmT_yuKhR795-HPw?select=zPzjUBRPBzW25fFuv1OJYw
~Disappointing. I could make the same thing at home with some sour orange soda and vanilla ice cream.

Total was around $130 after t/t ($44 pp with $12 scallops).

Having had a much better dinner last time, I was extremely disappointed. Definitely the worst Michelin experience I&#39;ve had."

At least 3 of our courses came out drenched in a apple butter emulsion.  Another course had pear butter emulsion on it.  Right off the bat, that&#39;s 50% of the meal that tasted pretty similar.  Now, I do not dislike apple butter, but I do not like it that much either.

Other courses were okay, but were forgetable.  There was a meat plate we had that was very very smokey.  Smokey to the point where it was difficult to eat.

The quail was okay.  But just okay.

The steak plate they brought us was okay as well.  But again, when you order the 100.00 tasting menu, you expect better than okay.

I liked the panna cotta desert, but my wife thought it tasted a bit too much like licorice for her.

They gave us one cookie for the 8th course.  Not a big deal I suppose, but when you are paying $25 bucks more for 3 more courses you would not expect them to phone in a course.

All in all, I sort of feel like the entire experience was phoned in from start to finish.

Nothing was bad, but nothing was really that great either.  After reading all of the positive reviews on yelp, I expected a New York experience that we would be talking about for a long time.

What we got was New Jersey.  Ugh.  Who wants to remember New Jersey?"

We were able to modify the tasting menu slightly to accommodate our interest in the pork belly dish. Our waiter was enthusiastic and well versed in the menu, but was not skilled at communicating outside of the menu. He mistakenly promised us a chocolate dessert when instead served a walnut cannoli. After pointing this out, he quickly rectified the situation with a second, though unnecessary, dessert. His drink recommendations were experienced and took to guiding each diner through options as requested. Overall, would certainly visit again but can see the slight gaps in food/service that have lost Vie the Michelin star. Individual dish reviews below:

First: Crispy local mushroom gnocchi, duck confit, grilled porcinis and cabbage, lemon. Fantastic dish and blend of flavors, however it was prepared differently from the menu description lacking any sign of crispy.

Entree 1: Australian sea bass, curried creamed corn, confit red thumb fingerling potatoes, marinated genesis growers japanese eggplant, thai basil, shaved candy onions. Very aromatic and unique blend. Presentation was beautiful with significant use of vertical space given the ingredient set.

Entree 2: cdk ranch pork combination: smoked pork belly and wood-grilled loin, braised city farm collard greens, green tomato puree, tasso, cornbread sauce, marinated summer squash. This left much to be desired for me. I found that some of my pork loin had an unnatural taste to it (a hint of the preparation almost like a bit of lighter fluid. Subtle taste, yet still unsettling.)

Cheese: Local brie style cheese from Woodstock, IL.  Very creamy and rich cheese with a toasted fruit baguette.

Intermezzo: Raspberry gelato. Rather standard but delicious nonetheless.

Dessert: Walnut cannoli and apple ice cream. Complex flavors but light enough for dessert after a filling meal.

Extra Dessert: Valrhona 
Chocolate cremeux, chocolate brownie cake, cocoa streusel, thyme honey cream sauce, cocoa tuile, burnt honey ice cream

Birthday dessert - more chocolate brownie cake and an caramel honey ice cream &amp; streusel side."

I love how Vie&#39;s deceptively simple food is not only beautiful to look at but full of flavor and always has a little sumpin extra - whether it be some smoke, some pickles, or something super fresh from a local garden.

Romantic dinner for two, Friday 2/17, 7:45pm reservations

Wow, what a memorable dinner. Ambiance at Vie is romantic and seating is spacious, which was a nice change from the loud, close seating at some of the &#34;other&#34; Michelin Star rated restaurants in the Chicago area.

Service was also top-notch. Our water glasses never reached halfway, complimentary bread is replenished quickly (!), and the course spacing was well timed. The same goes with the wine pairings; brought out before each course. Our waiter was also very friendly, never overbearing, and never interrupted at inappropriate times.

The food was fantastic. Most memorable dishes were the beet salad (I&#39;ve never had anything like it before) and the valrhona chocolate mousse bar dessert (the soft caramel was amazing). I would order both of these dishes again.

All of this during Restaurant Week!!

Vie was truly a fantastic experience and the highlight of our Restaurant Week adventures. I&#39;m glad I got over the 30 minute drive out of the city to give it a try, because I would have missed something special."

I  should have come here for the Yelp Eats event, I might have been more satisfied.  I had such high expectations and it just didn&#39;t get near them.

First disappointment was our table.  We were seated next to the coat rack, diagonal from the door and next to the bar.  No one came in or out of that place without disturbing our table.  I had made the reservation a month in advance for 6:00 on a Tuesday night and the restaurant was very empty when we arrived.

The service was not nearly what I expected for a restaurant with these prices and reputation.  The waiter was a bit bored mixed with mild aggression.  I never felt like he was serving us, more of doing us a favor.

For the first course I had the beignet which was very boring with a super salsa on it.  I then had the pear salad which was overpowered by the salad dressing but had nice texture.  I then had the pike which was very good but the rice and veggies were bland and uninspiring.  I also had two glasses of iced tea and split an average chocolate cake dessert with my friend.  

My food, tax and tip was 105.00.  For that kind of money I could have super service at Capital Grille or Topolobampo.  This restaurant had very average service, it shocked me.  And a lousy table.   For less money I could have a better meal at Dan McGee&#39;s in Frankfort. 

I can&#39;t imagine that I will be back.  Rats."

This happened yesterday evening (August 1st) and after 10 minutes we walked out and went to a lovely chef owned French restaurant. Since this was a very close friends birthday, we figured on spending $500 to $600 that evening. As we left, I said to the young hostess, obviously no one cares about the customer. Now in good consicense, the chef did call the birthday girl&#39;s cell to find out what happened. TOO LATE. They will never see a dime of my money. There are way too many chef owned restaurants that actually train their staff to place the customer FIRST. John"

On Sunday they give you half a page menu you literally have only 3 choices to pick for dinner I tried all and it wasn&#39;t that good I could of made a better dish at home they gave you one choice of salad and the salad was not great again probably could of made a better one at home the rest of mu groupbhated the salad. It will probably be quite sometime before I think of coming back. I came here a 7month prior and the food was great I don&#39;t know what happened.

My wife and I met up with one of her coworkers and had an enjoyable time. Had I not had the privilege of recently having dinners at some of Chicago&#39;s best restaurants (Schwa, Alinea and newcomer Goosefoot) this would have been an outstanding meal, but as good as Vie was it is not quite at the level of these other venues. 

Vie features contemporary American cuisine with a menu that changes with the seasons. There are two sizes of tasting menus (five and eight course) as well as an a la carte option (which we opted for). A few of the appetizers sounded appealing so I took our server&#39;s advice and ordered the Yukon potato gnocchi with wilted spinach, creme fraiche, shallots and pig jowl. While it was nothing extraordinary, it was tasty and I was pleased with my selection. My wife opted for a cheese plate to kick off her meal and the server was helpful in talking her through the options so that she ended up with three cheeses to her liking. Prior to the appetizer a fish based amuse bouche was served (which was decent) as well as some fresh bread (that was also decent, but nothing worth mentioning in a Yelp review). 

I really enjoyed my main course. I have always been a big meat eater, but recently have been trying to order seafood more frequently and the server highly recommended the pan-roasted Texas redfish cooked with braised Maine calamari and various veggies. Most of the time when I stray from meat I find myself envying my wife&#39;s steak, but tonight I was very glad I listened to the server and ordered the redfish. It was outstanding and one of the better fish dishes I have had. The sauce was excellent. My wife (Midwestern girl that she is) opted for the Q7 Ranch ribeye and thought that it was great as well and cooked perfectly to her specifications. 

For dessert I ordered an apple crepe with candied chestnuts and Grand Marnier infused whipped cream. This was tasty and was a nice end to the meal. There were also a couple of very nice sounding gelatos with creative flavors such as popcorn on the dessert menu.

Service for the most part was good, but there were some minor snafus. There was a couple of lengthy delays at times (our meal lasted just over three hours, a bit on the long side for the number of courses we ordered, but we did not mind so much as we were enjoying ourselves). My wife&#39;s appetizer did not come out quite as she had requested and there was a small error on the bill. 

Vie offers a good value for the quality of the food and is one of just two Michelin star restaurants in the suburbs of Chicago. Adding to the value is that on Tuesdays they allow you to BYOB without corkage despite having a fairly extensive wine list. For two appetizers, two entrees a dessert and a coffee our tab was about $120 before tax and gratuity. Vie also offers some special events such as cooking classes and a $25 two course Sunday Supper. If I did not have so many great restaurants within a few miles of my condo I would definitely be a regular at Vie, but since it is a trek I am not likely to make it back in the near future. I am however inspired to try executive chef Paul Virant&#39;s newer venue (and Bib Gourmand recipient), Perennial Virant which is much closer to home."

Just a drop off and then came by to get orders.  Cheese plate was good, not great.  A little small on portioning.
I had the steak, done rare plus.  Came more like medium rare.  Strange that broccoli that came with it was crisp.  Is that right?  Didn&#39;t seem so to me.  The corn cake with shortrib side was actually kind of pastey and gross.
The gooey cake for dessert was excellent, the best of the dinner.  Maybe I just go back for dessert... like you could do that.

Mommies &amp; Martini&#39;s (dinner group with a bunch of friends)  took it to the burbs one evening to indulge. Vie was excellent. The decor, the ambiance, the staff, the food, the drinks...  Everything was spot on

Started with drinks at the bar as we waited for all of the mommies to arrive.  We had a party of 6.  The bartender was so great!!  He created a special drink for one of the moms. She loved it.

Our waitress was superb.  Very knowledgeable.  The menu changes often so we were very pleased with her recommendations.  We felt like she was very personable. 

I want to say that all of the food was grass fed, organic, gluten free and nut free.  Not sure.  But I know that portions of the menu are .  One of the mommys has a gluten and nut allergy.  I know that they use local farmers.

We loved it so much that we shut the place down.  We were there after every other table left.  The owner happened to be there.  He sent over little cordial glasses of some type of bellini or something or other.  Excellent last touch...

So there was one last thing that was hilarious.  We ended up tipping our waitress incorrectly!  I think her tip should have been like $65 and we ended up tipping her $12.  She very politely came over to ask if we were pleased with her service.  We knew to look at the tip to see if we had expressed just how pleased we were.  Whelp.  Yep.  $12 doesn&#39;t scream excellence.  We fixed it."

I found the food to be fresh and quite tasty. I especially like the lettuce soup as a slightly spicy pepper juice was drizzled in it and it had bits of fresh octopus making it really quite tasty.

I had to do that because she&#39;s old school and would have kicked my ass up and down the street for spending so much money on food, which she considers an inconvenience that must be suffered between bouts of living your life.  I also had to pay up front, which the restaurant helped me handle, because taking the check out of the equation around an older Asian person is generally a good idea unless you want to physically fight them for it.

$65 prix fixe menu got us a a few options for apps, entrees, and dessert.  The appetizers were light and included gnocchi and quiche.  The entrees stole the show - soft, buttery whitefish and perfectly-cooked steak means there&#39;s a competent hand in the back.  Dessert left us wanting.

I started with their browned gnocchi appetizer, which was simply excellent. Really tender, flavorful gnocchi, on a little serving of the most delicious pureed cauliflower I&#39;ve ever had, and with lightly browned marcona almonds for a really good additional flavor. If this had been my entree, I&#39;d be stoked about this place. We also ordered an off menu cold squash soup with peek toe crab, garnished with mint. Also excellent and refreshing, but a rather small serving for the price. Here&#39;s the take away - those appetizers were excellent. 

My entree was the chicken fried steak, which was OK, but not great. Not a lot of beef flavor, and seating in a pool of creamy polenta. Honestly, the polenta was better than the steak, and it make the breading soften and fall off. Another diner had the mushroom crepes, which I would actually say were not good - I certainly wouldn&#39;t order them, and finally, someone else had a fish item, which was light tasting, well cooked, with just a bit of seasoning. 

Dessert for me was a sour cherry tart with some crispy oatmeal topping and buttermilk ice cream. It was good, but again, not great. Kind of just decent sour cherry sauce, honestly. Not a lot of style, when you get right now to it. 

Here&#39;s the kicker. The bill for the limited, prix fixe Yelp Eats menu - three each of appetizers, entrees, and desserts, plus one additional item came to nearly exactly the same as a recent meal at Adelle&#39;s in Wheaton (see my previous review) which included two appetizers, three salads, three entrees, and two desserts. So, honestly, more food from Adelle&#39;s, far superior food, less expensive food once you remember that the Yelp Eats menu is pretty discounted...Vie just didn&#39;t blow me away (except for that gnocchi). 

On the way out, I realized that Vie has a Michelin star. I know I&#39;m eating from a limited menu, but this just proves to me that I have no idea how those things are awarded. How can Vie, with it&#39;s vastly less creative menu and food that is unquestionably a cut below, get the same rating as Tru? I&#39;m just confused. Yeah, I&#39;d return to Vie...maybe...but I&#39;d go to Adelle&#39;s first if I had the option, and have a better meal, probably for less."

Can&#39;t wait to take my husband back there..."

We wish it was not BBQ week as we would have liked to try other items. However, the first course was very good...I had the andouille sausage with corn pudding and my husband had the tuna tartare salad.  Our second course was a not as great. I had the beef brisket which I found very good but my husband&#39;s pork shoulder which was dry. The last course was also very good I had the apple cake with salted carmel ice cream it was just the right size to not be completely stuffed and it was delicious. My husband had the oreo pudding and it was very creamy and had nice flavor and again the right size. 
We are looking forward to returning to Vie for another meal."
vie-restaurant-western-springs-2,Amy G.,DkLchSmFmcBNXNezHikEng,"Chicago, IL",0,1,0,34,42,xLbAK___f9h61fAIqocgYQ,5.0,2013-02-10,"Friends and I came here for Restaurant Week.

Our server was pleasant and made great suggestions, even concocting a nonalcoholic libation for my mom-to-be friend. We were limited to the four courses of the Restaurant Week menu, but we were not disappointed. The Gunthrop Farms chicken as the first course was absolutely delicious, followed by sun chokes (a much unappreciated vegetable) with sturgeon(?), I honestly can&#39;t remember except that it was too good not to finish. And there was still trout for the main course and creme brulee to end which ended my desire to ever eat any other creme brulee. It was not soupy and oily- the way most often prepared. This was moist, somewhere between ladyfingers and flan, with a smooth, rich, and somehow slightly grainy finish. Absolutely phenomenal. 

With only slight knowledge chef Paul Virant&#39;s passion for pickling and preserving, we inquired if that was done on site. Our server responded with so much enthusiasm she arranged for us to tour their premises. We met chef Paul and saw every cranny of the operation from their outdoor smoker to the pantries of preserves to the main kitchen itself. Everyone seemed incredibly proud of the operation, as they should be. We commented on the uniqueness of the preserves and were treated to an impromptu tasting (even after 4 courses, we couldn&#39;t pass it up) over a final cocktail before catching the train back to the real world. 

With wine pairings, an extra drink, and the Restaurant Week price of $44/pp, it was more like $100/pp with tax and tip. So go for a special occasion or if you&#39;re caught in the &#39;burbs. Pay the money. It&#39;s that or freakin&#39; Cheesecake Factory. And you know what I mean."

The place looks great: lovely spacing, nice decor, and you can hear the person sitting across from you without any problems. The service is amazing! They definitely take care of you and make sure that you&#39;re doing well. The first time we ate at Vie, they thought my husband was a food critic (I think it was the white dancing shoes he was wearing) and they were especially attentive--not that they usually aren&#39;t, we just thought it was funny. They have always given us extra goodies and although I might not know what we&#39;re eating (it&#39;s usually something pickled and delicious!) I&#39;m not afraid to give it a try. 
My husband decided to propose to me at Vie on our last outing. The weather was terrible outside, but we still made the trip and had a very pleasant dining experience. I wish I could tell you exactly what we ate, but their menu changes constantly that it&#39;s not currently listed on their website. For starters we ordered the pan-roasted white perch and I ordered a rice soup with tiny lemon wedge triangles and arancini balls. The Chef/Owner, Paul, came out and offered us some whipped scrambled eggs with truffle oil and oven-grilled bread. It was delicious! For our entrees we ordered a pork dish with home fries and the seared salmon with wilted spinach. Dessert was recommended by our awesome server: Valrhona caraibe bavarian, caramelia ganache, flourless chocolate sponge, and salted caramel sauce. My husband coordinated with the staff to have them bring out flowers and the ring with dessert. After the proposal, Paul brought us some champagne to celebrate. They were very friendly and attentive. It was such an amazing experience and I&#39;m so happy that the mister picked Vie for this special occasion.
Vie is definitely a place everyone should try at least once (subsequent visits will ensue)!"

Bread texture is quite good. The meals timing was not spaced evenly. 

1st course - the shrimp was chewy and the lemon tasted bitter. Sauce Too overpowering. 

2nd course - salad- really does not live up. I can make this at home.  deep fried potato does not go with the salad. Salad dressing too sour. Leafs were  bitter.

3rd - whitefish - it&#39;s deep fried. Can&#39;t go wrong. This has to be one of the most normal tasting dish.  At least it wasn&#39;t bitter or salty. 

The dessert was probably my favorite part. Had the orange sherbert float."

So the four of us decided to try it.  We went there during restaurant week and they had a wine pairing with four flight dinner. Some of us had this others did not. All had different dishes and we all shared. The food, atmosphere and service was top notch.  My brother was a chef at one time and we are all well traveled and have eaten all over at some of the best restaurants in the U.S.  I thought as did the others that it was a really great experience. Not snobby at all.  We met the chef and took a tour of the restaurant.  He uses seasonal foods for his creations so it may not be the same often.  The use of these ingredients to make the creations were phenomenal.  The two who had the wine pairings were really impressed with the perfect match that was created. I do not drink wine so I cannot say.  For a restaurant in the suburbs , this one is a gem.
We live 30 minutes away but travel to fine restaurants often to try them.  Definitely worth the trip."

An excellent place for a client dinner, a date, to get out of the dog house, or one to check off the foodie bucket list.

PROS: Beautiful, peaceful scene even when it was bustling with lots of people. It feels like a scaled down version of the Four Seasons NY lobby inside. A nice respute from a rainy day or slushy winter. Closer to the train, and parking is easy. Portions on the plates are moderate and sensible. You are eating pretty clean here, things are not loaded with butter or processed foods, but you will get a kick of some great flavor combinations. They have simple and complex dishes. I hate lamb, HATE I SAY!!! My husband too, but the lamb dish here was so good, we both wanted seconds. 

CONS: If it is a busy weekend night, expect to wait a little longer for a specialty drink or your 8 course meal. Thursday was indeed the sweet spot. This is not TGI Fridays, no, you can&#39;t get a meal and drink here for under $25 bucks, you pay for quality, expertise and great service.

What most people do not know: You&#39;d be amazed to see what goes on in such a small kitchen in the back....there is very little that is pre-made....these nuts do everything from scratch. The specialized charcuterie THAT THEY MAKE THEMSELVES is quite a process. We were lucky enough to get a tour after the meal.They also make their own jams and bread too.

Go ahead and be the west coast snob that asks where their items are sourced and they are on their game knowing it all. You&#39;ll be glad to know how many items are local if not made right in house.

 I still just can&#39;t get over how tiny the kitchen is for the volume of food that needs to be served.

 If you are still reading this you must one of those undecided Type A personalities... go....stop reading this..go....you will enjoy it. : )"
vie-restaurant-western-springs-2,L B.,SFQeEVD6C3xbHLFa2Uqw_g,"Chicago, IL",0,1,1,3,321,OfKUfhTcRF2hSmBOnKgPKg,5.0,2014-07-05,"The cocktails at the bar are very creative and the bartenders are among the best, but I suspect Chef Paul does not pay enough attention to what&#39;s happening here and the flagship of his empire has sprung a leak.

At one point Vie was my reference fine restaurant. I have eaten there many times and had food at the bar fairly often. Chef Paul Virant has never let me down. Until now. This restaurant has fallen from a five star touch-stone to a two star rip-off .

My last experience here completely broke the bond of trust that I had developed from so many fine meals. I ordered a beef entree, one that I thought that I had before. The mess of flavors and empty junk made a mockery of the fact that it cost more than anything else on the menu. Frankly, not worthy of Mongolian Barbecue and at a price that could feed the whole family! Just awful. I have tried hard to forgive them for this fiasco, and if it happens again I will reduce the rating to one star and start eating Starbucks instead.

However, after my latest visit everything seems OK again. Notably, this time we saw that Chef Paul was in the kitchen so I suspect the occasion of the issues mentioned above he was working at one of his many other properties. Chef Paul remains awesome, but finding staff to maintain his excellence must remain difficult."

When you type Vie in to the search bar it pops up with 4.5 stars as its average and that is exactly what it deserves.

&#34;But Mark, you gave an Italian beef joint 5 stars, surely this was better.&#34;
Yes and no - it&#39;s a matter of comparison. Apples to apples. Vie to J&#39;sBeef is apples to rutabagas. Gourmet to guilty pleasure.

On any note - we made the reservation on Opentable.com and it worked out great. We even included a note that we&#39;d love to receive an autographed-copy of the daily menu for my wife&#39;s parents, since this was a Christmas gift. They knew about it and took care of it quietly and professionally (and awesomely). 

The food was some of the best I&#39;ve had in the suburbs. 
We started with the black truffle risotto. Was it worth $25? Not at all. I understand that using black truffles creates a higher cost but I think it could have been achieved with a lesser mushroom since the mushroom taste was no more of a hint rather than the focus. Mind you, it was mighty tasty but I didn&#39;t feel it warranted $25 for a small dose of delicious.

From there, everyone else loved their dishes. 
I had the roasted caveny farm rouen duck breast. The best part about my meal were two things. First, the duck farmers were sitting behind us (cool) and, second, the buckwheat crepe with almond and cherry jam blew my mind. It was the tastiest crepe I&#39;ve ever come in contact with.

The duck, however, was well seasoned but felt overcooked. I ate it just the same but focused on the buckwheat crepe. 

I can&#39;t remember what we are for dessert but I know it took me a stomach-overload and to a land of sugary bliss. 

It&#39;s a great place to try if you don&#39;t want to make the trip to the city, you don&#39;t want to pay for parking and you want a top-notch dinner."

At first, I was resistant to going to Vie. I&#39;m a city girl, through and through, and have a general aversion to trekking out to the &#39;burbs for, well, anything. During the seemingly interminable drive to the restaurant that my friend picked, I kept thinking &#39;what does Western Springs have that we couldn&#39;t have found in Chicago?&#39; Well, simply put, it has Vie.

Upon arrival, we were seated immediately. The place is decorated simply but tastefully with black and white photographs. The servers, like the place, are sophisticated without being pretentious  and not at all annoyed by the inevitable ingredient question I had for each course &#34;what is confit? saba? pave?&#34; 

Despite a four course offering, the first and third courses were the stars of the show as were the perfectly selected wine pairings we opted to get.

First Course: confit gunthorp chicken thigh, split pea puree, roasted carrots, house-cured olives, meyer olives. 
I typically favor white meat, that is, until I tasted Vie&#39;s chicken thighs. The flavors melded together so perfectly that it stopped me mid-sentence. I was forced to shut up and just enjoy the moment. Meanwhile, my friend was starting to gloat, &#34;See? Mm, hm. Told you.&#34;

Third Course: slagel farm pork milanese, braised black lentils, roasted onions, citrus mostarda, blatt farm pickled green tomatoes, pork jus.
This was the highlight of my evening.  I anticipated the small servings typical of high-end dining and was pleasantly surprised at the unexpectedly huge portion: they stacked two large pieces of fried pork loin. I could&#39;ve easily taken half home but it was so delicious I couldn&#39;t stop. It turned into &#39;one more bite&#39;; &#39;really, this is my last bite&#39;. 

Unlike other high-end eateries, you will not be hungry when you leave here. We wrapped up dinner at about 11pm and were so full we had to walk along the Metra tracks to atone for our gluttony. 

Overall, one of the best restaurants I&#39;ve ever been to in the Chicagoland area."

We&#39;ve been a number of times and it remains consistently fantastic across the board.  

Service is always friendly and timely - if you ask for a recommendation from a server, the response is always enthusiastic and I have not been steered wrong, either from a food or beverage standpoint.  

I can always find something new and interesting on the menu to try - some of the recent standouts include goat, which I had not had there before but which was flavorful and tender and pretty amazing, and fried risotto balls, which were tasty and comforting and unexpected, especially with the smoky lentils.  The charcuterie plate is worth a try, as well, especially since the items are made in house.  And the desserts - I am a big fan of dessert and I find that there is always something for everyone&#39;s tastes, ranging from something a bit more savory to the sweet-sweet goodies that I love.  

Make the time to take a visit - it is completely worth it, whether you are coming from the suburbs or even farther afield."

Apparently Michelin feels the same way after having awarded vie with it&#39;s only star in suburbia.  Only 22 Chicago restaurants shared that honor.

We arrived on half-priced wine Monday night for my wife&#39;s birthday and ordered the 5-course chef&#39;s choice menu.  I will describe what was the first PERFECT meal on my life. 

The most tender poached skate I have ever had started the meal, next we had a charcuterie plate full of homemade delicacies like mortadella, liverwurst,and coppa among other items, then seared ocean trout on bed of lentils which was cooked perfectly, next was a wood-grilled lamb loin with a wonderful sauce, for dessert was a delicious cheese plate and chestnut rum cake with a coffee caramel sauce. 

I was stunned."

The atmosphere is very clean and modern. The linens and place settings were crisp and spotless. We were greeted by friendly staff. The service was excellent. They took care of us throughout the night. Also, they were helpful with my gluten allergy. My waitor told me what I could and could not eat.

The food was to die for. We started off with an amuse of pork with asparagus and some delicious sauce. Our first course was a charcuterie of rabbit pate and other meats with accompaniments.  Our second course was a marinated squash salad. It was delicious. Our main course was a ribeye entree with fried potatoes and braised short rib. Our final course was a delicious cheese spread with accompaniments. The wine was excellent too. I had a glass of pinot noir from Healdsburg, and a late harvest reisling. OMG.

I called and placed an order for pick up and the very articulate man on the other end of the phone line told me that the order would be ready in 15-20 minutes.  Although this was an off eating hour, 3 pm, I knew that there were others eating as well because he had put me on hold while taking another phone order. Yes, this place definitely has customers, always a good sign.  

I ordered a few small items off of the online menu.  When I arrived exactly 15 minutes later everything was packaged in a nice brown paper bag with a printed packing slip stapled at the top.  Wow, I guess even the small mom &amp; pop shops these days are tech savvy!  

The food was STEAMING HOT!  Obviously freshly cooked and not just reheated.  Upon arriving home I scooped out the white rice and was astonished that it was so soft and tender!  The combo fried rice was the same softness, not too oily, with plenty of baby shrimp, pork &amp; veggies to go around.  The beef kow was heavenly!  The meat was surprisingly tender with veggies that weren&#39;t overcooked, nice and green instead of wilty looking.  And the taste of everything else was fresh-tasting &amp; without too much salt.

Well that keeps happening here. I just love their sweet and sour shrimp lunch special. I think it takes me back to Cincinnati in &#39;79 when I first experienced fine Chinese food at Eah Mei&#39;s on Fountain Square. Yen Ching&#39;s shrimp takes me back to those days, when we could order a Volcano drink (at 18) and enjoy some fine dining. 

Over the years here I have explored other dishes but. their shrimp is magical. It is a heavy breading, but put it on top of the fried rice and drizzle a small portion of the sauce on top, as they give it to you on the side and prepare yourself for a nap... Especially if you polish of the egg roll, or rangoon if you prefer. I&#39;m a little bummed they took the soup as an option off the table but the special still comes with a can of pop, it&#39;s better than an increase. 

If they&#39;d offer brown rice I&#39;d give them five stars. Such nice people! Great value!"

I was hoping to see some sprouts, scallions and maybe some chopped onions.  What I was happy to NOT see were peas and carrots. I also got the General Tso&#39;s chicken which was good as well but a little more on the sweet side than spicy. 

The service I had was AMAZING!  The man who took my order was incredibly sweet and even allowed my sister to get a substitution with her order. The price was incredibly reasonable, the portions were large and it only took 10 minutes (we went at 6:30pm on a Tuesday). Additionally, the restaurant was INCREDIBLY clean. 

Overall, the food was good, not the best I have ever had, but not the worst.  It was a bit of a drive from where I live to go here and I do have closer Chinese food places, but I will definitely come back here again."

I&#39;ve eaten from Taiwan around the world to Tokyo and everywhere in between. I think Chinese food is subjective. It&#39;s as regional as BBQ. Still, what&#39;s good is good. For Chicagoland, I&#39;d set Chi-Tung as our measuring stick (10/10). Given that, I&#39;d grade Yen Ching a 6/10. This first visit I had General Tso&#39;s and sweet and sour chicken with a side of shrimp fried rice. The orange chicken is slightly above average where the general Tso&#39;s (slightly mushy breading, under sauced and over-salted) underwhelmed. The fried rice, arguably the easiest of dishes to master, was pedestrian at best. Given the ratings from frequenters, I may try some other dishes and change my rating."

Not the most authentic, but there&#39;s few places in Naperville that put out the real deal. He use to have a restaurant off Ogden where all the car dealerships are, that might have been in &#39;89-early 90&#39;s. My mom flipped when she discovered he reopened right down the street. 

The service is very friendly and they will always get your order right.

For STARTERS we&#39;ve had their egg rolls, crab rangoon, pot stickers, and beef teriyaki. The egg rolls are so-so, the crab rangoon is probably my favorite in Naperville (their big crispy triangles), the pot stickers usually have too much covering but the pork filling is good. 

For CHICKEN we&#39;ve tried their curry, sesame, general tso&#39;s, and orange. All or just OK. Aside from the curry, they usually have a heavy sauce that gets gelatinous rather quickly. 

Their Szechuan, Kung Pao, Mongolian, and Moo Shu preparations are all pretty good. You can choose the meat. Lo Mein is just OK and the fried rice is only OK. 

One of their specialties is Sha Cha Shrimp and Scallops, that&#39;s a damn good dish.

Everything came together on my first visit:  great service (thank you Alexa), wonderful food, beautiful d√©cor, awesome background music, and the perfect ambient temperature in the restaurant (it was chilly, drizzly night).

As a gluten-free vegetarian, I know I have limited options at (most other) restaurants.  I was so thrilled to find a place relatively close to my home which has several options for me.  They have a separate gluten-free menu that supplements the main menu, it uses the same numbering scheme and lets you know if a dish naturally gluten-free, or if it needs a modification, such as substitution of noodles, omit oyster/soy sauce, etc.

I had the curry dish (#29 on both the GF and regular menu) - it was a delightful combination of veggies (and some mango) in an expertly-crafted curry sauce served with a side of rice.  It was flavorful and filling.  I cannot wait to come back and try something new on my next visit."

Most Vietnamese restaurants in the U.S. today are almost diners - having eschewed the French influence, and it is now mostly Banh Mi&#39;s, drinks, and average Pho.

Little Saigon changes this. It strikes me as a 21st century restaurant in Saigon. Modern, with a unique flair, and highlighting the best that Vietnamese cuisine can be.

We tried the Pho, of course (we shared, otherwise that would have been a meal for one), and it was slightly Americanized, but definitely tasty. The other dishes were what really gave them a fifth star - mostly Vietnamese, some French, but David (the chef/owner) distinctly gave them a modern spin that was impressive.

Highly recommended."

For the main entree my wife had the lemongrass chicken, which was amazing.  I ordered the same thing I ordered last time, seafood combination with shrimp, scallops and calamari.

First, we were warmly greeted on a Monday night by the hostess.  It was not a busy time/day, so they offered to have us choose our table.  We chose a table along the wall with a cushioned bench on one side, chairs on the other.  The atmosphere is very comfortable, not too fancy, but definitely no slouch either.  Modern, warm, inviting.   Our server was warm, friendly, very professional, knowledgeable about Vietnamese food and the menu. I wish I could remember her name so I could give her a shout out!  She was very attentive but not at all intrusive.   All the staff here are top notch, and bring back service how it should be at an upscale restaurant. Very impressive to say the least.  The prices are very reasonable, I could easily spend this much at a boring, unimaginative chain restaurant.  No complaints here...
     Now for the food.  We ordered the Cha gio appetizer, fried spring rolls that you actually wrap in butter lettuce with fresh mint, pickled carrot and radish, with chili lime sauce on the side.  They were so good we ate all four of them.  The taste with all the fresh ingredients was out of this world.  Not your average spring rolls.   I am new to Pho, but not new to Vietnamese food.  I did a yelp search for Pho in my area.  I came here from the Western suburbs to try authentic Pho, and wow!!!  Just wow!  This is not your bland-need-to-bury-it-under-sauces type Pho.  I ordered the Pho Ga, and the broth was aromatic and complex.  Delicious, offered with lots of fresh mix-ins, basil, sprouts, greens (possibly dandelion, I don&#39;t know for sure but they were delicious), jalapeno, cilantro, lime, and chili/hoisin sauce in a dish poured in a yin/yang presentation.  Cool, right?  I did use the sauce at first, but not much was needed.  The dish was fresh, delicious, and so very satisfying.  Comfort food on a whole other level!  My daughter ordered the #28, Banh Pho Xao, wide rice noodles saut√©ed in a soy garlic sauce with onion, pepper, and chicken.  The look on her face after the first bite was priceless.  She was in foodie heaven.  Her dish was delicious, a yummy mix of stir fried rice noodle, vegetable, and chicken in a tasty sauce. 
    I can&#39;t say enough good about this place...the food, the atmosphere, the staff were all wonderful and quite a refreshing change from the monotonous chain restaurants we are surrounded by in the suburbs.  Chef (who is also the owner)  even took the time to come out and introduce himself make sure we had a good experience.  Super classy if you ask me.  It&#39;s a half hour from my house, and I could pass about a hundred other places on the way...but guess what, I already made reservations for Sunday to meet my parents, who live in New Lenox, there to get them hooked on it.  If I were you I&#39;d get over there and try it...but don&#39;t tell too many people.  I want to still be able to get a table!!!  :)"

It was busy but not too crowded. We were surprised at how much bigger the restaurant is on the inside! It&#39;s decorated very modern, with a beautiful wine bar greeting you as you come in. 

It took us a while to choose from the menu, everything sounded delicious! I ended up going with #26, Ca Ri Ga, Sauteed chicken breast with eggplant, mango, yams, long beans and curry sauce. My husband chose the #34, Ca Nuong La Chuoi, Grilled trout with oyster mushrooms and cellophane noodles, served steamed in a banana leaf with curry sauce. We also ordered an appetizer of the sugar cane shrimp. We were not made to feel foolish for not knowing the proper pronunciations which was nice. And more importantly every bit of food was moist, flavorful and beautifully presented.

Both owners managed to find time to chat to each patron. They were very polite and professional. The prices were also very manageable for the quality of food and the area. Entrees were between $12-19 with some more expensive specials to pick from.

Absolute love their take on a Vietnamese cocktail menu. 
The decor emphasizes the new era of minimalism yet still have focal point pieces that perfectly represents the core culture. 
Must try Cha Gio, Ca Bam Xuc Trang, &amp; Pho!

But fortunately it appears to have turned around. I also understand that the chef here used to be the chef at LaColonial downtown ( I loved going there when I lived downtown). 

I was greeted promptly and seated. Menu came quick and the server asked the right questions and was knowledgeable about the offerings. After I placed my order based on his recommendation I was promptly brought my drink. A complementary appetizer was sent out right after the iced tea. Very nice touch! The spring rolls were perfect. 

Now the entree. I had the number 25 which was lemon grass chicken spiced up with tomatoes, portobello mushrooms, onions and jalape√±os. It arrived right after I finished my spring rolls. The temperature was good, presentation was fine, but the side of rice looked like it was dried out and hard. 

Sure enough, the rice was past it&#39;s useful life. It was not steamy and moist, but hard and dried out. When the bartender came over to check on me I told her about the rice. She apologized and had a fresh bowl of rice sent out. Other than that, the meal was pretty good, service was good and welcoming. I will definitely return to try the other menu items."

The lotus salad of fresh herbs and green mixed lettuces and lotus sprouts and shrimp and chicken was very much like the ones I had in Vietnam.

Route 59 is great for shopping, but this corridor is plagued by almost nothing but unhealthy chain restaurants.  

This is where Little Saigon shines, both inside and out, as a fresh-food, privately-owned, well-managed restaurant that Plainfield, Shorewood, and Joliet residents can be proud of.  

From the moment you walk in the door, you know you&#39;re in for a great experience.  We were warmly greeted by an incredible open space filled with classy decor and natural light.  We were seated promptly and after explaining this was our first time trying Vietnamese food to our waiter, and he was delighted to share his knowledge of the menu.

From his advice, my wife ordered the #25 G√† X√†o S t, which is lemongrass chicken and portobello mushrooms served in a basil chili sauce with japalenos and tomatoes.  My wife is usually intolerant of any kind of spice (I ate her jalapenos), but she loved it.  More importantly, everything was perfectly cooked and seasoned.

I tried the #37 Cm Chi√™n B√≤ L√∫c Lc, which is filet mignon cubes over fried rice served with a side salad of tomatoes, cucumbers, daikon, and carrots.  Again, everything was just perfect, and in just the right portion sizes.  I can&#39;t stand walking away from a restaurant with leftovers and feeling sickeningly full; not an issue in the least here.

There is absolutely no doubt we will come back to try more on our next visit.  Thank you, Little Saigon, for a wonderful evening and for showing us all how restaurants should be."

I Walked  through the entry and was instantly impressed with the decor, the restaurant used a contemporary Asian style with white being the dominant scheme. After being seated, I was approached by my server, who was very friendly and outgoing.  He asked if I had ever had Vietnamese before, when I responded that I had, he correctly guessed it was Pho. After reviewing the menu, I made my choice,  which he complimented, then asked if I wanted anything to drink, I chose  the Vietnamese coffee.

After a few moments, my server presented with my coffee and a carafe of water. The coffee was a free-pour affair, decanting in a rocks glass containing sweetened, condensed milk. The water was tap, but filtered, so it was just fine.

My server soon brought out my lunch entr√©e, #25, the Ga Xao Xa Ot, containing bits of chicken, mushrooms, jalape√±os, and basil. It was a little on the cold side, but full of spicy flavor, just the way I like it. 

My server checked in after a few moments to see if everything was fine: it was. I continued lunch uninterrupted, enjoying the mix of 80s pop, an 90s jazz being played at an acceptable level. At 12:30, the restaurant was at 40 percent capacity. I imagine this is due to the location and lack of publicity, making this a good find, while it lasts.

In short, a great find with some good food, nice decor, and friendly service. I just hope the location doesn&#39;t kill it, because it&#39;s a great place to try something different."

I love the fact that it looks clean inside and has that kind of modern look. I went there with my son and ordered a large oxtail pho, spring rolls, and a glass of wine. The service was great. My spring rolls were very fresh and I loved the oxtail soup base (although there weren&#39;t any actual oxtail pieces in it as I thought it would).  However, for a large size, my pho was actually a small portion. I thought, at least. Nonetheless it won&#39;t stop me from dining in!"

Made a reservation for Mother&#39;s Day via Yelp and ended up having to change it and add another person which I was able to do via the app. I called the next day to confirm everything had gone through and the woman on the phone was pleasant, helpful, and courteous. 
When we arrived (4:30pm) we were greeted and quickly seated. They had just re-opened at 4pm for their dinner service but there were already a few tables in there seated. Staff was attentive- we never had to wave them down to get their attention for anything. Our server, Jenn, was able to make recommendations and answer questions. Our order came out quickly and correctly.
We ordered a few appetizers (#1- Fried Spring Rolls, #2- Soft Salad Rolls, #6-Fried Shrimp Rolls) and everything was amazing. We (4 adults 1 kid) split everything. My 18 month old loved the fried spring rolls. I&#39;ve never had anything like the soft salad rolls and they were very light and refreshing- kind of palette cleansing. 
Everyone got something different and I can say that every person enjoyed their meal- only leftovers we had left were from my son&#39;s fried rice. I got the #28 (wide rice noodles with shrimp) and it was delicious. Flavorful, lots of veggies, the shrimp were large and perfectly cooked. I ordered my son the side of chicken fried rice. He ate it up! He even happily ate his leftovers the next day (and I had some of it and it was great. Not greasy like a lot of fried rice.)
My mom and I each had the mango mousse cake for dessert. Let me preface this by saying the only fruit I like involved with chocolate is strawberries but I decided to give it a whirl. So glad I did. The mango mousse was light, spongy, and fresh. The cake under it was complimentary, and the mango and chocolate swirls on the plate finished it perfectly. 
All the plates were beautiful. Everything was fresh and light. I was too busy enjoying everything to take a picture. The decor is clean and modern, there was music playing but it wasn&#39;t too loud and it was a good variety (Black Keys to Bee Gees while we were there). Before we left my mom and I were each given a very generous gift certificate for Mother&#39;s Day which we thought was sweet. 
We left with full bellies but weren&#39;t overstuffed. Everyone raved about it. My parents kept thanking me for suggesting it. We all look forward to returning. Like I needed another reason to go to Target nearby."

We had #1...Cha Gio, #11...Pho Tai Bo Vien, #25...Ga Xao Sa Ot, #34...Ca Nuong La Chuoi, and #41...Ca Tim Nuong. I would highly recommend any of these dishes. Our server Alex was great, knowledgeable, accommodating to our sharing three ways, attentive to when we needed water, and so pleasant. I&#39;ve enjoyed a lot of Vietnamese food and this ranks on top. The seasonings were just right. The ingredients were fresh and plentiful, the fish was tender and moist. The curry sauce enhanced the fish rather than taking over. The chicken was plentiful and perfectly cooked. We enjoyed the fried spring rolls with the fresh lettuce and herbs. The eggplant, perfectly grilled, was wonderfully seasoned, tender, and tasty. I wish the chef/owner David all the success with his restaurant. We had a truly delightful meal and hope to return."

But I wanted to highlight how good the customer service is at this restaurant.

We ordered a vegetarian friend rice but they accidentally gave us the fried rice with beef, shrimp and calamari (not sure who&#39;s fault that was, but our waitress was great).  No big deal, it happens, and since it cooked quickly we weren&#39;t upset or anything.  Not only did the waitress apologize, the manager came out to apologize, they packed up the incorrect fried rice and gave it to us to go, then they made the correct fried rice and took it off our bill.  That&#39;s really above and beyond, in my opinion, and Little Saigon goes the extra mile in every way, including customer service."

That did not happen,LOL. We got numbers 1, 8, 25, and 42.  Alex was our server and we will ask for him again. Jennifer was the bartender, but also ran our food over to us. She is the owners cousin, so Stacey and I asked a lot of questions.  Jennifer answered all of them brilliantly.  When we ordered our food were were informed 25 is spicy, so I informed the server that I wanted it spicy, not &#34;white boy spicy.&#34;  He laughed and said extra spicy it is. Later, when talking to the owner and head chef, I asked if &#34;not white boy spicy&#34; is what Alex wrote down. He laughed and said no, but he agreed that it was funny. I look forward to trying new dishes here. Hopefully in June they will start construction of a patio area or outside seating. A reso for Friday and Saturday nights is a must we were told."

When we found out that the head chef from there opened his own restaurant in Shorewood (45 minutes south west of where we live) we had to make the drive out there! It&#39;s a plus that it&#39;s at a fraction of the price too! You can make the drive out there and still save money!

The restaurant decor and ambiance is incredible, I expected it be simple and plain like all the other typical Vietnamese restaurant. The space had a rustic yet modern feel to it. Kudos to the designer!

Food was amazing! In my opinion, I personally think it was better than Le Colonial. This could be because they are mass producing the dishes (like they do in larger restaurants). Just wonderful flavors! It&#39;s like fireworks in your mouth!

Recommendations Food - #1 Cha Gio (eggrolls), #36 Ca Kho To, #37 Com Chien Bo Luc Lac. We were limited to what we could get because there was only 2 of us, but we&#39;ll be back to try more dishes!"

I wasn&#39;t really ready for a full meal, so I selected a salad which was tasty.  My son had a small bowl of soup which wasn&#39;t what I would consider &#34;small&#34; at all!!!  I wonder what the big bowl is like?  He also had an entr√©e which included a few veggies that he had never eaten before.  We both absolutely loved everything, which is hard to believe because he is not a veggie eater or a rice eater.  He ate every morsel of rice because it was soaked in an awesome sauce.

This was seriously one of the most amazing dishes I have ever had. The curry was on the sweeter side and the yams and mangos made it very interesting and delicious. The tofu was done perfectly. My fianc√© had Banh Pho Xao with beef. (a Pad Thai-like dish). He loved it.  He said the beef was tender and the flavor was perfect.

In the past four days I&#39;ve been twice and would have happily eaten all of my meals here!

Those with Celiac Disease will be glad to know they offer a significant gluten-free menu and have a good grasp of gluten-free food preparation. Note that most of the pork and beef dishes are not gluten free due to the presence of soy sauce in the marinades. The chef does offer many dishes with chicken, seafood and tofu as the protein. I do recommend speaking with the manager when ordering just to be sure there are no issues. She&#39;s very willing to speak to the chef and double check on any questions.

I&#39;ve found myself thinking about Ph T√°i B√≤ Vi√™n aka Oxtail Pho which is perfectly satisfying even on these hot days due to the addition of mint, basil and cilantro. The B√°nh X√®o is super interesting in taste and texture and is thus far my favorite!

The manager also stopped by our table to check in, a nice touch. Last, can you believe a restaurant this nice is in Shorewood ( no offense). The restaurant looks like it should be in Naperville or another large suburb. Please tell your friends so we can keep this place open. One of my new favorite places!

Update: I&#39;ve been picking up take out quite a bit lately at lunch. It&#39;s always packed up and ready in the timeframe provided. It comes with all the accoutrements and is still hot. Amazing!"

I&#39;ve tried a few entree options including the lemongrass chicken and it was phenomenal. 

The side of chicken fried rice was seriously the best Asian dish I&#39;ve ever had. I feel like it is weird to say that...but it had a flavor that was indescribably delectable! I actually ordered it for my 1 year old daughter and my husband and I ended up eating the whole thing! Sorry, kiddo! 

The servers are also great about making recommendations (in case you&#39;ve never had Vietnamese...which makes the food even more approachable!) and explaining how to eat certain dishes.

This one is OK, but does not really compare to most we have been to in the Chicago area. We had the crepe and the shrimp on sugarcane stick. The shrimp was pretty good; the crepe was OK, but not as good as we are used to having. For entrees, we had saut√©ed beef tenderloin with sate spice, long beans and yams, and it was bland and boring; nothing like a Vietnamese sate that are spicy with a kick.

There are not many 5 star worthy places to eat in our area. I don&#39;t know why the chef at little Saigon decided to open here but man am I glad he did! We went Sunday evening for dinner. The ambiance was Modern and comfortable. It wasn&#39;t overly crowded and it wasn&#39;t loud. We really had a great time being able to sit and talk with one another and hear one another. My husband tried the imported Lucky Buddha Beer any really loved it. I had iced tea and it was delicious and made fresh. We ordered the fried spring rolls for an appetizer and they serve them with fresh mint leaves so I took a couple of mint leaves and put them in my tea. :-) I had the shrimp sa te and my husband had the shrimp pho. They were both incredibly good I mean really really good. The produce was so fresh and crisp everything was cooked perfectly the shrimp was enormous and it was not overcooked. A lot of restaurants constantly over cook their shrimp so it&#39;s delightful to find a place that knows how to cook it to perfection. If you&#39;ve never had Vietnamese food you are really missing out. It is so light and so flavorful because they use a lot of fresh herbs and spices. If you&#39;re really looking for a place to go where you can eat and elegant meal and not spend a fortune and have your food be fresh and cooked perfectly, this is the place you should try next.

I was excited because of all of the great reviews. Unfortunately, it was just not meant to be. When compared to other great burgers I&#39;ve had at various restaurants, these just do not stack up. But let me rewind a bit...

We arrived on a very busy Saturday night. There is no hostess or anything. You wiggle your way to the bar and tell them you want a table, and one of the bartenders will put your name down on a mystery list. The restaurant itself is very small. I was expecting something else on the inside. I would say this place is 80% bar and 20% tables. So if you want to go somewhere where it&#39;s not a noisy bar, this is definitely not the place for you. 

I had a cider and my husband had a draft at the bar while we waited. The beers here are good and there is a good selection. When we sat down, we ordered the jalape√±o poppers to start. These came out and were massive! However, the bacon was burnt into another dimension of time and space. Somehow, the ranch sauce pulled it all together and it was still edible. 

Then came the burgers. My husband ordered a Maui Waui and I ordered the Premier burger with sweet potato fries and Parmesan truffle fries (up charge for both types of fries, but cool with us). We both wanted ours medium rare. We got the regular ol&#39; patties. They were very thick. 


Unfortunately, my burger was cooked until it was very, very dead. I think, maybe, my burger came back from the dead, and then the cook had to re-kill it with fire. My husband&#39;s burger was cooked ok, but it was missing jalape√±os and had the tiniest little piece of pineapple hiding on it. If you can&#39;t tell, right now I&#39;m making a sad face. 

The thick cut fries were the stars here, which kinda sucks because this is a burger place! I was so excited to come here, but I&#39;m not even sure if I ate half my meal. Although service and drinks were okay, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be back. I&#39;ll just head next door to Tango for their lunch burger or I&#39;ll make the hike out to Kuma&#39;s in Schaumburg."

Service was probably a 4. My low rating reflects my experience with a number of seriously over-served individuals at 7:30 on a Friday night. 

I went to Jackson Ave Pub as part of a group of four. We all had starters, dinner, and drinks. The food was good (jalapeno poppers &amp; spinach &amp; artichoke dip with chips as starters, I had the classic burger) and the drink menu is pretty standard (not wildly creative but solid) in a way that pairs well with the average bar-food options (although creative burger choices) they offer. Our service was pleasant, attentive and timely - food didn&#39;t take long despite it being busy. 

However, I will say that there were at least three people (all together) who were seriously inebriated. They made dining a thoroughly uncomfortable experience: one was physically out of control and somehow managed to (repeatedly) jab me in the back with his elbow despite being seated at completely different tables. They spilt their beer with their antics, migrated to the bar, and continued to drink where they were saying rather impolite things quite loudly. Let&#39;s be clear: this behavior is something that I don&#39;t really have grounds to complain about at a club at 11 at night. But for a place like Jackson Ave Pub, at 7:30 on a Friday? I expected better.

I realize it&#39;s been a couple years since it became Jackson Ave Pub, but it remains a good local beer/burger place.

The food is hearty and the burger choices are inventive.   I had the Bulleit Bourbon Burger, and could taste the sweetness, while arugula was a nice touch.  Hand cut fries were really good and went well with the burger.  By the way, giving an option of a traditional Kaiser-type bun or a pretzel bun is great-I had the pretzel.

Beer choices, both bottled and draft are plentiful.  It&#39;s not a large place, but I recommend going for a late lunch or after work spot during the week or a mid to late afternoon early dinner/pre-night out on the weekend."

The burger was delicious and prepared just right.  I didn&#39;t taste much cheese or spread  since the burger was so big and delicious.  Their homemade fries are addicting and they give you a generous portion.
They have a number of interesting beers on-tap and mix a very competent rye manhattan.
Jackson Ave Pub is a definite thumbs-up!"

Two reasons for 4/5

1. They serve grass-fed beef burgers (and have a million topping choices)
2. Bacon-wrapped dates.

They also have sweet potato fries, which is a major win!

I have to say that the burger and the fries were definitely under seasoned, but I was alright with adding my own salt and pepper. It was nice to be in a place with a cool vibe, laid back atmosphere and decent service."

It&#39;s cute and quaint and almost creepy in it&#39;s cleanliness and friendliness - definitely not something you expect just out of a big city. 

I was meeting a friend for the first time and she was spot on with this suggestion. A small little bar tucked off the main street, Jackson&#39;s has a great menu of interesting burgers. They were big and juicy, came with a giant order of fries and I took half home to eat later. 

It&#39;s a bit dark in there and it was very crowded by the time we left at 7 pm. But a lot of the other stuff I saw in the area was chains, so I was happy to avoid that and have a killer burger on top of that!"

It is pretty small, with a nice casual seat your own kinda atmosphere.  We dropped in on an early Saturday evening, college football games were playing on the many TVs, and there always seemed to be a table or two empty.  We were sitting pretty close to the door and it was pretty cold out, so when people entered or left, it got a little chilly. I had no problem keeping my coat on for dinner though. 

Our server was attentive and pleasant, checked in occasionally through the meal. The front page of the menu is appetizers and salads, and the back page is a long list of burger options.  There are some creative options on pub fare.  Angus beef patties can be subbed for chicken breast or house-made vegetarian patties, and can come with a regular or pretzel bun. 

We ended up going with the pretzel sticks with beer cheese for a starter, which wasn&#39;t bad, but kind of forgettable. The burgers were really good though. I got the drunken pear burger, a delicious mess of burger, arugula, bourbon poached pear slices, goat cheese, and balsamic glaze. 

I like that there are many options for side dishes, different salads and various fried potatoes or sweet potatoes. Some sides require a small upcharge, such as the parmesan truffle fries.  I got the side house salad and was happy - it was a nice size, beautiful bed of mixed greens with just a little tomato, cucumber and croutons thrown on top without going overboard, and a good balsamic vinaigrette."

My husband had a beer and me, a Moscow Mule. We ordered dates wrapped in bacon and a buffalo chicken flatbread to share. The dates were outstanding. Loved them. The buffalo chicken flatbread was good. It could have used more blue cheese as that flavor got lost. I did like the crunchy raw carrots and celery on top. The burgers looked fantastic and I&#39;ll probably be back to try those. There were many to choose from on the menu. The waitstaff was friendly and the place clean. The woman&#39;s bathroom (just a onesie) was very clean which is rare in a bar. Prices weren&#39;t too bad either.  I would come back here again."

Standing in the corner of downtown Naperville on a more than dreary Saturday, my husband and I decided to let Yelp decide where we should pop into for a drink and a bite.

The first place to pop up was Jackson Ave Pub... And we&#39;re glad it did!

It&#39;s a small place, dark and cozy with a couple TVs over the bar to keep the sports fans happy. They have a great beer selection... Lots of local places and craft seasonals.

While we didn&#39;t order entrees, we had a hard time deciding between all the delicious-sounding appetizers... With our sever&#39;s help, we decided on a go-to: buffalo chicken flatbread, and a feature: fried artichoke hearts.

Both were unassuming in appearance, but wonderfully delicious. Especially the fried artichoke hearts; I&#39;ve not heard of those before, but will certainly be on the lookout for them! Served with a side of ranch, they were everything we wanted them to be: salty, crunch and arti-chokey... 

A great little place to tuck into..."

But before we even had a chance to browse their food menu, we were taken back by their beers on draft...loved seeing crafts like Dogfish Head, Bells Oberon, Allagash White and Solemn Oath!  All of our closest friends. Fantastic.

Brew in hand, we browsed the menu. Tons of burger options! I went with the Santa Fe Burger - grass fed beef with cheddar, pepper jack, pico de gallo and avocado on a pretzel bun with a side of house fries. It was everything I imagined and more. This burger was big, juicy and served at the perfect temp. The combo of cheese and pico de gallo was pretty bomb dot com. I highly recommend the Santa Fe. My husband got the hangover burger (bacon, fried egg, cheddar and swiss) which looked amazing as well. 

I totally dig the vibe in the bar. Super chill with cool artwork, but still has a handful of TVs for catching the game. The only reason I couldn&#39;t give a fifth star was because of the service. Although the couple people behind the bar seemed nice, they just weren&#39;t very attentive. We weren&#39;t greeted right away when we got there and we sat finished with our meal for quite some time before anyone offered the check.  It could have been an off day for them, who knows. I&#39;ll be back regardless.

Great food, great beers. See ya there!"

A zillion years ago I knew this place as the red door tavern, I think, but it has clearly changed hands and for the better! What was once kind of an eyesore of a dive bar has become a cute, warm, and inviting pub with TVs adorning the corners and fun music at slightly higher than reasonable for old people levels. They have Stella cidre which is my current drink of choice and a limited food menu with incredibly well seasoned fries and cute but extraordinarily plain sliders, there are other items of course but that&#39;s what we tried. On a Friday night the place was PACKED and people were hovering around tables pleading with their eyes for people to leave, but definitely not the obnoxiousness levels you&#39;d expect to find at a Naperville bar.

I don&#39;t like eating with my coat on, but I had to do that which just damaged my dining experience.  We specifically chose a place to sit that was far from the door in the back and I was still cold.  The restroom had no heat at all, but at least I could use the hot water to warm up my hands.

Let&#39;s just say I had NO idea this place even existed! It&#39;s not that it&#39;s hidden, I just don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever walked or driven down this street to notice it was there.    We decided to kill some time and grab a beer here.  For a Friday night it was a little crowded but we found a table in the back of the bar which was empty.

Our waitress brought us menus - we were stuffed from our dinner at Neo, but I did check it out and DO want to go back and try their burgers - both burgers and appetizers looked pretty good and worth trying sometime.  My friend ordered a Solemn Oath draft, and I ordered a Summer Shandy - they don&#39;t have drink specials on Friday nights so that was a bummer but it was a nice little place to check out for sure.

I will be back!"

I had the&#34;Smokey&#34; burger, medium rare on a pretzel bun with sweet potato fries. The burger was not huge, but perfect. The medium rare was really medium rare. And the toppings made it delicious. The three other burgers at the table (medium-well to well) were all hits too.

And the servers were all great. Everybody was helpful and friendly. Food came out quickly. And the guy bringing the food had mad skills juggling four plates. 

And I was pleased that they had a great variety of beers on tap.  I am so tired of bars that serve 18 IPAs + Alagash wheat and Millet lite. IPAs are crappy and pretentious. They have plenty of them here if you like that, but they had a great variety for the rest of us, who don&#39;t need our beer to cross the ocean on a slow ship to India.

The place was a little loud at Friday happy hour for my taste, but I would still hang here in a heartbeat. The only complaint I could muster is that the sweet potato fries are too salty. (I know you are selling beer.)

I hope this venue stays under this management for a long time."

The hubs and I each ordered the grass-fed beef burgers - santa fe and the fried pickle.  Quality of the beef definitely stood out, and the meat itself was cooked the way we wanted - medium and medium rare, not overcooked like most other burger joints.  The pretzel bun made it even better - forgot how much I love that!  I subbed out the regular fries for sweet potato fries - they didn&#39;t sprinkle them with sugar, so I really appreciated that.  I hate when restaurants have the tendency to add sugar when the sweet potatoes already have the natural sweetness. The only thing I didn&#39;t care for was the apple slaw - too vinegary for my taste, but if you&#39;re on a paleo diet of some sort, it would definitely be up your alley.  

All in all, there were certainly more positives than negatives.  The place is a little small, but we got seated at 8pm immediately on a Monday night even though there were some football games playing on their big screen TVs.  Nice and cozy, good atmosphere, and of course decent quality burgers.  I look forward to going back to try a different flavor combo."

I called ahead and reserved a table for 10 with no problems. They of course waited for everyone to show up to use the table which is really not a big deal. It&#39;s totally understandable. The ambiance was casual, though pretty noisy. I don&#39;t know if it was because there was a game on, but it was too loud to hear someone 2 seats down from me. Maybe we should&#39;ve picked somewhere else for a large group.

+1 The drunken pear burger is delicious. Sliced pear, goat cheese, arugula and a vinaigrette and it was amazing! I had it with the grass-fed beef. My only complaint about the burger was that my medium-well burger was well done and pretty dry. Without the goat cheese and vinaigrette, it would&#39;ve been hard to swallow without some sort of sauce. It came with house fries. I got sweet potato fries instead. Though, after tasting my husband&#39;s fries, I wish I would&#39;ve gone with the hose fries. Sweet potato fries are good, but just the standard bagged sweet potato fries (i.e. not fresh). 

I had a Victory Golden Monkey which was only $6 and my husband had a Gumball Head (yeah, they actually had it). 

Good spot for sports watching or a quick bite. Not so great for a large group.

The waitress did well managing us, though and we had no problems splitting the bill 7 or so ways."

I decided to try The Grass Fed &#34;Smokey&#34; Burger (also can choose angus) ,  lettuce wrapped (no bun).  It was delicious.  Pepper jack cheese, arugula and chipotle aioli were a great combo.  Most of the table ordered pretzel buns and raved about their burgers as well.  For apps we shared the bacon wrapped jalape√±o poppers and also the bacon wrapped tater tots.  I preferred the poppers over the tots but a few at the table loved the tots.  I will definitely return for my red meat fix.  Usually after half a burger I push it away tired of the taste.

I had the goat cheese burger, although I thought about ordering something else.  There&#39;s something about restaurants and goat cheese, the portions are always so tiny!  Not at Jackson Ave!  The goat cheese covered my whole burger and some oozed over the sides.  Every bite was perfectly cheesy.

They don&#39;t screw around on the upcharging either.  You can get your burger on a house bun, pretzel roll, or as a wrap, at no additional charge.  So of course I went with the far superior pretzel roll.  They do charge additional if you want grass fed beef (+$1) or for &#34;upgraded&#34; fries. But the house fries were really good.  My husband had the truffle fries, also very good.  They were a little too savory paired with my goat cheese burger, so my regular house fries are surprisingly just as satisfying as the truffle fries.  They were cooked perfectly.  French fry heaven!

I perused the beer menu which had a lot of good options.  Lots of fancy drafts I&#39;ve never heard of from Two Brothers, and lots of stuff I have (Goose Island 312, Miller Lite).

It was equally busy as it was slow for a Tuesday night.  Mostly an older crowd (to me, that&#39;s 50-ish) and a much more relaxed environment than Jimmy&#39;s, Features, Bar Louie, or other downtown spots.  It doesn&#39;t look like the frat boys or bachelorette parties are going to hang out here.  Jackson Ave replaced the Grumpy Bulldog, and my only memory of the Grumpy Bulldog involved rubbing a friend&#39;s scarf on my face, taking a tequila shot, and then throwing up in the bathroom at Jimmy&#39;s.  Oh, and the art in the Jackson Ave ladies bathroom is beautiful.

Two burgers and a beer only set us back about $30.  And we left totally stuffed.  It probably wasn&#39;t the best choice after light eats at the Eddie Merlot Yelp event, but I don&#39;t regret going to Jackson Ave!"

The interior is identical to the bar it replaced, The Grumpy Bulldog. Our waitress wasn&#39;t very personable. Sure, she was friendly and brought us our drinks quickly, but that was about all. A couple came in with their infant in a stroller and sat down behind us. The infant, of course, was crying loudly and the parents were clearly oblivious to their child&#39;s distress. I became worried and starting drinking my beer quickly. 

I tried a Prairie Path by Two Brothers, which I really enjoyed. I was about to order a second when a party of two adults and six small (under 8 years old) children came in and seated themselves next to us. The children were waving balloon animals arounds- smacking each other as well as myself. That right there was our cue to pay our bill and get out of there as fast as possible. Which is exactly what we did.

I don&#39;t know what people are thinking when they bring small children into a place that considers themselves a &#34;craft beer pub.&#34; Small children generally don&#39;t do very well sitting on stools at a high-top table. Maybe that&#39;s just my observation, though. I was very annoyed; all I wanted to do was enjoy a beer, post-baby shower with two of my friends. Yet enjoyment was not achieved, seeing as how I felt like I was seated at a bar a family friendly restaurant (Chili&#39;s or Applebees come to mind). 

Thanks but no thanks."

We went there tonight for apps only - bacon wrapped dates, chicken quesadillas, and sliders.  Everything was fantastic (especially the dates - my favorite)!  The service was also impeccable.

My only complaint is that this place has a more &#34;bar&#34; vibe, rather than &#34;pub&#34; feel.  I wouldn&#39;t call it cozy, charming, or inviting - the feel of the place is merely that of a watering hole, really no character.  If you&#39;ve ever been to Elephant &amp; Castle, Poag Mahones, or Dylan&#39;s downtown - you know what I mean by &#34;pub,&#34; and this is not it.

We started with one of their feature items, the chicken pot pie soup. It came out piping hot and served with a small side of pretzel bread. It was amazing. For entrees I decided on the fried pickle burger with tater tots and my boyfriend got the Diablo burger with Cajun fries, both on pretzel buns. Oh my god, they were delicious!!!

It&#39;s right next to Tango to the west and I can&#39;t remember what was there before."

Gumballhead on tap permanently! I love their beer selection and with more 3 Floyd&#39;s beers on tap, the bar has been raised. 
The staff is friendly and knows their regulars while treating newcomers the same. 

The food continues to be excellent with new specials weekly. If you haven&#39;t had the drumsticks, you should. And though I love their burgers don&#39;t think that&#39;s all they have. Their salads and home made dressings are just as good.

The entire establishment is just one room, with the bar on one side, some tables on the other, and just enough room to walk through in the middle.  They always have a rotating selection of awesome beers, and the food is fantastic!  I&#39;ve eaten here many times and always been very happy.  Their burgers made from grass-fed beef are fantastic, and are available 17 different ways (really!)  My favorite though, is their chicken sandwich, which is available in the same 17 varieties as the burgers.  Try the &#34;Border&#34; chicken sandwich: one of the best sandwiches I&#39;ve ever had.  It&#39;s grilled chicken breast topped with salsa verde, pepper jack, avacado, and fried tortilla strips.  Oh, and it comes with enough fries to feed a small family...  

Everyone who works here is great: very friendly and helpful.  It&#39;s the kind of place where they start remembering your name after you&#39;ve been there a few times - very cool.  Other reviewers have mentioned the bathroom situation (not enough of &#39;em) but that&#39;s only been a problem once when I&#39;ve been there.

I would give this place 4 stars if it was located almost anywhere else other than downtown Naperville.  I&#39;ll just leave it at that.....

Luckily, we didn&#39;t have any awkward interaction with the servers, as Courtney C. has had other awkward interactions while out and about, discussing her unemployment debacle...but I digress...

The menu offers a variety of meats, cheeses, pastas, pizzas, etc. but we unanimously decided on three shared plates:

*Mascarpone Polenta with ragu of the day:  The &#39;ragu&#39; was a braised short-rib; the polenta was creamy and rich, and the meat was tender.  I have never had anything like this.  It&#39;s served in two sizes, we got the small, and I think it was the perfect portion.

*Whipped Ricotta with honey:  It&#39;s whipped cheese and honey, spread on crispy, chewy toasted bread.  Need I say more?  The ricotta was served in a cutesy little mason jar, but honestly I&#39;d eat this out of a damn toilet bowl, it was THAT good.  The honey was served as a chunk on a square of paper, making it impossible to spread and our fingers grossly sticky.  This should be thought-out a little better.

*Meatballs:  Meatballs are never my go-to, ever.  But these meatballs are not frozen or weird jelly-looking stuff in the crockpot at a superbowl party.  No.  THESE meatballs are tender, savory, and also made with proscuitto.  YUM.

The cocktail menu is short and concise, the wine list is more vast.  I chose a Viognier, it was okay, nothing special.

We ended our meal with the Cannoli Cheesecake.  It&#39;s exactly as good as it sounds!

When it comes to the atmosphere, I can take it or leave it.  The decor is cute, trendy, romantic; it&#39;s exactly what you would expect at an upscale Italian restaurant.  The tables were spaced far enough apart for people to walk by, or so I thought.  My purse hung on the back of my chair, which was quite small, and people (both customers AND employees) repeatedly knocked into the back of my chair and purse.  It was really annoying, I felt like I was being jostled in a bar.  The same thing happened to my friend and again to me when I thought hanging my purse on the other side of my chair would help.  Nope.

Our waitress was kind of absent during our meal.  We both admitted we would have ordered another drink if she had come back.  She seemed a little flustered though, so perhaps she had extra tables to take care of.

We were both full when we left and very happy with the food.  Three shared plates, a dessert for each of us, and a drink for each of us came to about $40 per person."

The food is always good and service is friendly and attentive. There&#39;s a bar when you first walk in and a semi-private room with a large table and then two dining rooms in back. The pizza oven is exposed into one dining area and you can watch them make the pizza. The place is not very busy at lunch and I never understand why as the food is spot on. Yesterday. I met my son here for lunch and we decided to share plates.  Our server was Valentina and she was sweet, attentive and provided wonderful service.  We started with the ricotta &amp; honeycomb vasi, which is a must for me. It&#39;s a creamy ricotta cheese served with a honeycomb and grilled bread. The combination of the sweet honey with the creamy cheese on top of crusty grilled bread is amazing. We then shared a formaggi &amp; salumi board served with crackers, apple compote, and nuts. The marinated olives we ordered with anchovies, shaved cucumber salad and cheese was very good, too. The cool cucumber with the salty anchovy...yum.  Finally, we shared the prosciutto pizza.  Crispy thin crust just like you&#39;d get in Italy, with plenty of prosciutto, mozzarella, fontina &amp; arugula. There was a very fresh almost lemony taste to this pizza which was so good.  I loved everything we ordered.  I highly recommend Davanti Enoteca for an intimate dinner, meeting friends or a small gathering in a semi-private room. This place never gets old for me!"

Things to note:
-Service is fantastic. I think the servers do a great job of reading the type of patron you are and visiting the table as frequent (or infrequent) as necessary. 
-Don&#39;t leave without ordering the ricotta + honey comb (vasi). And when you eat it, make sure you do add the honey. It adds so much to the toast!
-If you aren&#39;t drinking wine, try their Lemon Pellegrino. I haven&#39;t seen it on menu&#39;s elsewhere, and it&#39;s super yum.
-If you are drinking wine, come back on a Wednesday - half price wine night!

As much as their entrees are appealing, I prefer more of a &#34;tapas&#34; style of eating. So, I&#39;ve tried the majority of the pastas and several of the pizzas. I&#39;d review more in depth - but I haven&#39;t had anything I don&#39;t love. So I recommend: all of the food!!! You can&#39;t go wrong here."

Stop murdering a steak by pre-cutting, because then it dries out as you eat it. It may look fancy, but it doesn&#39;t taste fancy!!! 

 To get to main reason for the 3 stars...I had the Berry Crostata for dessert...it was less than appetizing. Crusts should be flaky, this was was soggy and had zero flavor. The berries were all smashed and gooey...which did not go well with a soggy crust. The crust tasted over mixed and under cooked. And no one asked me if I enjoyed it. I did not."

Unfortunately for Sunday brunch, they jsut seem to be understaffed.  The servers we&#39;ve had have been good so it&#39;s not a knock on them individually but, when you have a shower planned, you should have separate staff for the parties.  They do not do this here leading to exceptional service when you first arrive but that quickly tapers off as parties start to arrive.  I do not understand why they would not have specific staff for parties.  But I noticed multiple people working at least one of the two parties as well as the floor.  So that leave you sitting there with empty glasses for 20 minutes.  The first time I went, I thought perhaps it was a fluke, which is why I refrained from Yelping right away but consistency now shows me this must be the expected.  It&#39;s a shame cause the servers are actually good, they just need more when there are parties.  The bloody bar is outstanding.  It&#39;s so hard to find one of these in the burbs so if you&#39;re looking for one, I would recommend.  $8 for 1.5 shots and the bar to customize is a good value.  The first time I went, I had two service issues that stood out.  First, they brought my husband&#39;s food but not mine and the runner did not even say anything about mine being on its way.  So we sat their confused for about two minutes before I thought I need to flag someone down.  He said he would check and came back with my meal and said that one of my poached eggs broke and so they had to remake it, which is fine, had they said that or waited to bring out my husband&#39;s until both dishes were ready.  Secondly, I finished my bloody and thought that a glass of wine would be great.  I told the server I wanted one and she gave me the list and then never returned.  I did see her working a party though and she walked passed a few times.  I had to flag someone else down.  The second time the service wasn&#39;t as bad but very similar.  The ambiance in the bar area is very cool but if they are using that for a party, I don&#39;t care for the dining room as much.  It&#39;s also sort of awkward to walk through someone&#39;s party in the bar area.

As far as food, there were some hits and misses.  We got the charcuterie and cheese and one of the cheeses they brought was incorrect.  Although I don&#39;t believe the server had it wrong; I think it was mislabeled.  But it was a Parmesan that was supposed to be a gouda.  I&#39;ve had enough gouda to know this was not it but all you have to do is look at the description on the menu that says soft and creamy and this was yellow and extremely hard and salty.  When we brought it up, he insisted that was the gouda so I don&#39;t think it was his error but again, clearly wrong.  Other than that the charcuterie was just okay for me.  Perhaps some honey or spicy mustard would help.  Also the bread wasn&#39;t grilled.  Nothing was bad quality but the presentation was lacking.  The ricotta and honeycomb was solid but I wish there was more honey to ricotta cause after you have the first piece of comb, there is no more honey and you&#39;re stuck with 3/4 of a jar of ricotta.  But it&#39;s very spreadable and reminds me of a burrata appetizer.  When the bread came with this, it was actually toasted so I wish they would have done that with the charcuterie.  The standout for me was the polenta and ragu.  It was outstanding.  That day it was lamb and extremely tender and very tasty.  I will definitely get that again.  The pepperoni pizza was far too greasy and soggy for my taste.  It is not like a flatbread but a regular pizza and paper thin dough that is soggy.  The toppings were solid though.  The pork belly hash was another good dish.  The belly itself was well done and flavorful.  The French toast had good flavor but very underdone and doughy.  My husband was not a big fan.  But kudos to real hazelnuts as a topping.  Overall, a few above average dishes and a good vibe but understaffed for brunch and some dishes that are just not up to par.  However go for the bloody bar!"

It was my first time at Davanti but we&#39;ve been to the location before when it was another restaurant.  The decor is very rustic, Italian countryside - warm and inviting inside but we ate on the patio outside for this dinner, which was also very comfortable. 

The service from the waitstaff was just so-so...it took forever for her to finally take our drink order and then appetizer and main course orders.  I get the idea that they might be encouraging you to linger and savor and enjoy your food without rushing but she didn&#39;t even check in during the lengthy lulls.  I would have said that Davanti was a five-star experience if not for this. 

The food more than made up for the lackluster service - everything was fresh and delicious and the portions were fairly generous and suited for sharing.  We thoroughly enjoyed everything we ordered, including the cocktails, wine and then desserts (which we had indoors because a wicked thunderstorm blew up during our al fresco dinner and the management wanted us to move for our safety).

Well, although this location wasn&#39;t bookmarked, I saw the name &amp; knew my Yelp! friend, Susan H. has been to the same name in University Village (not certain if they&#39;re the same but it was worth a shot!) and I knew we had to try this place... that girl has pretty good taste. 

Seated (with reservations) &amp; greeted immediately by a very knowledgeable and friendly server. I told him my wine preference and he suggested the perfect one. What I loved the most was, the other wines he could have chose were more expensive, but instead of going with price, he went with quality. Right on man! 

Here was the menu:

Bruschetta:  asparagus, goat cheese, onions &amp; peppers

Ricotta &amp; honeycomb mason jar  

Veal meatballs 

Bistecca con funghi e fonduta: steak &amp; mushrooms

Davanti burger: bacon jam, roasted tomato,cheese curd, arugula, roasted garlic mayo, shoestring fries

I can&#39;t say anything we had was bad necessarily but some things could have been done slightly better. The Bruschetta was simply mouth watering, delicious &amp; I can&#39;t wait to have more. The ricotta mason jar was, well I guess it was okay but they need to infuse just a little more flavor into that jar (sorry Susan!). The veal meatballs were delish, but nothing spectacular. The steak and mushrooms were probably my least favorite of the night. The dish was flavorless, overcooked and something I definitely will not order again. The burger. . . welp, what can ya say about bacon jam, cheese curds and garlic mayo?! YUM! That burger was pretty awesome!

I had it a couple years ago and it was prepared differently and tasted better. It&#39;s the whole reason I came back, so I was pretty let down by what I got this time. Portions are very small for the price--even for tapas. Dessert list was not appealing at all. A good experience overall, but I wasn&#39;t wowed and I left a little hungry. 

Service was good, but not great. Employees were all very friendly. Server misheard my order (it is very loud in the restaurant) and brought out an entree he thought I ordered but did not. He immediately fixed it, so no problem there. It was a real struggle to get drinks refilled, however. They were very busy, and had many larger tables, so I will cut them some slack on that front. I&#39;m not sure if they were short staffed or not, but if this is typical Friday night busy, then more servers are needed.

I don&#39;t understand people complaining about orders coming out at different times. It&#39;s tapas, folks! This is how tapas works. I did not see this as a problem at all. In fact, our server told us before we even ordered that food would come to the table when it is ready.

Despite making reservations more than a week in advance, my party of 2 was seated right in the path of the kitchen and uncomfortably close to my fellow diners (so close I could have sampled the food on their table). Fortunately, my visit was not intended to be a super special one, so I&#39;m not knocking off any stars for that. (And we did get seated immediately at our reservation time, and the restaurant was definitely packed, so that was very good.) However, if you are including Davanti in your plans for a special occasion, I would suggest that you request seating that isn&#39;t an afterthought.

Parking lot was full when I arrived, and I was 15 minutes early. I hovered around the lot and was fortunate to see a spot open up fairly quickly. Others were not so lucky. I would recommended arriving 15-20 minutes early, at least, during peak dining hours. You may end up having to find street parking and huffing it back to the restaurant."

I came here on a date, felt immediately at home. The place has a cozy feel, has a strong emphasis on wine (I loved the wooden wall pieces made from wine crates!), and delicious food. What&#39;s unique about Davanti, is that it seems like they keep the menu pretty consistent, but the way they make something might change, based on what&#39;s in season. It&#39;s a cool concept instead of revamping a menu every few months.

We had a bruschetta to start- garlic toasted bread with a gorgonzola cheese spread, mushrooms, and sweet onions. It was a fantastic sweet and savory mix. I loved it!

For entrees, I ordered the rigatoni/pasta dish, my date had a seafood pasta. Portions are not huge, if you come very hungry you can easily eat it all. I did go home with some leftovers though. The seafood pasta was rich, but not overly so. My pasta was good, not over cooked, but wasn&#39;t super memorable. I think I&#39;d pick something else next time. 

Service here was wonderful. We arrived without a reservation, and they told us it&#39;d be a 30 minute wait (on a Friday). We were seated within 10. Our waitress was attentive and made wine suggestions to accommodate both of our differing tastes. Her suggestion was a winner for us both!

I&#39;m happy this place is so close to home. I will be back!"

Reason for 3 stars:  Waitstaff has no personality.  I don&#39;t think they want to be there.

We did everything we could to make this as smooth as possible, making reservations well ahead of time as well as arriving very early. Regardless, the night was an almost total clusterf*ck. We had reservations for 8:00, got there at 7:30, and were seated at 9:00... With our party split across two different tables with two different waitresses who weren&#39;t at all on the same page. One table ordered entrees, the other didn&#39;t, and when tables cleared out enough for us to eventually got seated together... Well, as you can imagine, half of our party got their dinner with the other half saying, &#34;Oh, you guys ordered?&#34; It was... Awkward.

Why four stars even though the whole night was pretty crazy? Well, the host and the guy who I can only assume was the manager was doing everything they could to make things right for us. Apparently the problem was a party who showed up at 5:00 who dug in and didn&#39;t leave until we did at 10:00. I can&#39;t really blame the restaurant for that, I wouldn&#39;t schedule tables around the idea that people would sit there for FIVE HOURS. The bar was also occupied for a private event, so there really wasn&#39;t anywhere for us to go. We all got a round of free drinks, a bunch of free appetizers, and so many apologies if I had a penny for each it would&#39;ve covered the rest of our dinner.

ANYWAY, since you&#39;re likely reading Yelp reviews for a NORMAL sized party just there for a normal dinner, let&#39;s cut to the chase- The food here was great, the appetizers we had were a variety of their different toasts. The truffle and egg one was the best, but beware if you&#39;re weird about eating raw eggs as this is basically raw egg paradise. If you&#39;re fine with that, you&#39;ll be in for an amazingly creamy, crusty, truffle-y goodness. Oh, the ricotta and honeycomb toast was nuts too.

I had spaghetti and meatballs for dinner, which isn&#39;t even on the menu, which kind of brings me to another complaint here. Before I get started, the food was great. Whoever is working in the kitchen definitely knows what they&#39;re doing. Whoever wrote the menu though... I kind of want to give them a taste of Gordon Ramsay yelling at them a la Kitchen Nightmares. (The UK one, not the trashy US one.)

The menu is so heinously pompous and full of itself it&#39;ll make your head spin. It seems like the menu author has nearly derived some level of gratification from using words he knows no one knows. How do I know that? The MENU INCLUDES A GOD DAMN GLOSSARY. This effectively is saying to your diners, &#34;Don&#39;t worry idiots, I know you don&#39;t know the amazing things I&#39;m about to serve you, that&#39;s why I included a list of words to dumb this down for ya&#39;ll.&#34; It&#39;s like reading A Clockwork Orange for the first time. It was clever when Anthony Burgess did it, not so much when the chef of a suburban Italian place does it.

So, yeah, that puts this review in a weird place. Our party seating was a disaster, the menu is ridiculous, but the food is great. At the end of the day, that&#39;s the important part of a restaurant, so, whatever. I guess the rest of it just makes for an entertaining story."

Their food is amazing and their restaurant build-out is really great as well--very industrial, wine cave-esque, but cozy, and the music sets a nice mood too.  We could easily sit here for hours just enjoying the ambiance.

They have a different Bruschetta every night which my fiance and I always order right away with our drinks no matter what it is--because it&#39;s always phenomenal.  We also really love that their whole concept is &#34;small plates&#34;.  Their appetizers and salads are what I would consider &#39;large&#39; small plates, but their &#34;entrees&#34; do seem to be truly small plates, so whenever we have actually made it far enough into the menu to get entrees we usually get a few of them.  We also really like that the food is not heavy at all--the salads are delicious, but lighter, and the same for the rest of their plates.  It&#39;s so hard to find yummy but relatively healthy food in this city but you definitely can find it at Davanti!

Davanti does get pretty crowded for dinner...it seems it doesn&#39;t really matter what night of the week it is, but we have never had a problem getting a table, and the longest we have ever had to wait is maybe 10 minutes...if that--we do prefer to sit in the bar area, but we&#39;ve never had a problem getting a table in the dining room either.   The service is also always fantastic!  And location is great!  Being right across the street from the tracks sometimes my fiance will just hop off the train from work and we will just meet there.

Definitely call ahead and make reservations, because this place will get packed. Walking in, it almost felt like we were downtown in the Loop. Loud, crowded, busy, all normally things I try to avoid. However, they lent themselves fittingly to a unique dining experience in the Southwest suburbs. Service throughout was friendly, helpful, and very knowledgeable. For being as packed as they were, food came out in due time, and we were rarely caught waiting. Serviceable beer menu and a stellar wine and cocktails married very well with their food offerings. Anyways, on to the food...

Apps - Bruschetta of the day; Prosciutto-Veal Meatballs; and the Riccota Honeycomb Vasi (mason jar). 
Concerning the bruschetta, it was freaking amazing. Topped with whipped goat cheese , grilled asparagus, caramelized onions, mushrooms, and peppers, it was probably the best dish of the night. Perfectly seasoned, and every ingredient propelled the next to stardom. 
The meatballs finished a close second. Solid seasoning and flavors however they were drier than most of your housemade Italian meatballs. The ragu paired well, and the sauteed onions, braised greens, and garlic definitely increased the dish&#39;s appeal and flavor construction. The shaved pecorino went mostly unnoticed :(
Sadly, the ricotta honeycomb mason jar finished last. We had heard all of the hype, but for me it was almost tasteless. That, and with so much ricotta there was hardly any honeycomb to go around. If and when we make it back, I&#39;ll have to pass on this one.

Mains - Davanti Burger, Bistecca con funghi + fonduta (steak with mushrooms, bleu cheese)
The burger was a solid 4 stars. Topped with cheese curds, bacon jam , roasted tomato, arugula, and garlic mayo , it had all the makings. Unfortunately the burger was under done and, at its center, almost raw. We enjoyed the beef blend flavor and overall presentation, but it was far from my top 5 burger list. The accompanying side of shoestring fries were well seasoned, however more or less inconsequential.
The strip steak, much like the burger, rated no higher than a 4 on the Yelp 5 scale. Decent flavor and presentation, but nothing over the top. I tend to eat my steak plain, as to enjoy the full flavor, so the bleu cheese and porchini mushrooms (with sauce) did nothing for me. Cooked properly to our order, but again, nothing extraordinary.

Don&#39;t get my somewhat harsh criticisms confused with what was a above average dining experience. Most every food offering we tasted was done very well. However, when dining at restaurants such as Davanti Enoteca, the level of expectation is raised, and anything less than run of the mill is hard to justify. We definitely enjoyed ourselves, and will be coming back, but a few of our choices will be modified on the next go around."

My dining partner had been to the location on Taylor Street and enjoyed his lunchtime layover there and my Dad had mentioned that the Taylor Street location was also Steve Dahl&#39;s pick when he appeared on Check Please, not that I&#39;m a die hard Steve Dahl fan (I&#39;m rarely up *that* early and radio ready) but  I enjoy listening to his show, even going back to the era when he shared airwaves with Garry Meier and there&#39;s some nostalgic value in there from when my Dad would drive me to school super early and I could smell his (probably melting) plastic cup of coffee with creamer while Steve and Garry played on the radio. I guess what I&#39;m trying to get across here is that I&#39;m not a Steve Dahl groupie or anything, but I&#39;ve got respect for the man&#39;s opinion, so why not give Davanti Enoteca a try. 

It was Sunday around 3pm during Labor Day weekend and the place was packed. We walked in basically looking like drowned rats after being drizzled and dampened during our daylong walkabout at Brookfield, while everyone else here looked like they were straight out of Forbes. We had to wait a few minutes before being seated at a small 2-seater high-top in the bar by the window, and it appeared as though we&#39;d beat the rush as not even 10-minutes later the waiting area was crammed full of people and poured over into the dining room and didn&#39;t clear out until we were almost done with our meals -- if you can, make a reservation. 

The menu is tapas-style, but some of the items are still on the small side for sharing plates. As mentioned earlier, the regular clientele didn&#39;t seem to be folks on a budget (as you could tell just from most of the patron&#39;s attire and overly tanned old-men with wives reminiscent of Lucille Bluth), but I was determined to make this an affordable meal as I knew if it were not, I likely wouldn&#39;t be rushing back.   

The first step to having an affordable meal, is to not do drinks. I was very tempted by their cocktails, but they were definitely going to push the bill up a good $10-$15 per drink, so I stuck with water, though they did have a few $8 glasses of wine and $4-$6 bottles of beer, but I opted to not go in that direction as the only beer I was interested in was the draft Matilda, but I felt the $9 price tag was a few bucks above the market value you&#39;d see posted at other bars. So we stuck with water and the server was nice and didn&#39;t judge us like some other places do when you opt for the free or cheapest thing on the menu. 

We started with:
**Marinated Olives - $6 - served warm in a mini cast-iron pot. I&#39;d never had hot marinated olives before, and these were really something. The mix of olives was pretty good, although there was one olive that my partner proclaimed as his favorite, but when we fished around the pot we saw that the one he&#39;d already eaten was the only one that was in there, so I didn&#39;t get to try it, but the other olives were meaty and delicious and that was good enough for me. I&#39;d definitely get this dish again on my next visit. 

**House Bruschette - $5  -(Sunday daily special price) Davanti runs some really great daily specials so we decided to take advantage of the $5 offer even though I pretty much hate bread, especially crusty, because my partner pretty much lives and breathes for this carb-y concoction. The $5 bruschette special was good on the chef&#39;s special bruschette but we went with the meat-free house bruschette with traditional basil, EVOO, mozzarella, etc and it was pretty mind-blowing -- and that&#39;s coming from a person who generally detests bruschette. It made me wonder if I&#39;d just never had good bruschette before and we were glad it was cut into an even amount of pieces so we didn&#39;t have to fight for the oddball slice. My favorite part was that the bread wasn&#39;t hard. It had a lightly crusted outside, but inside was soft and warm and tasted like heaven. 

For our main courses:
Gnudi Pomodoro - $14 - (ricotta dumplings, San Marzano tomato, mozzarella di bufala, basil) This dish was delicious, albeit comically small. It&#39;s served in a teeny tiny bowl with an absolutely giant brim for presentation. It&#39;s hard to tell from the pic I added, but there&#39;s only 5 pieces of the ricotta dumplings in there and the spoon is a good reference for the size. The flavor was outstanding, but even if I were just eating for myself and not sharing at all, I think I&#39;d need three orders of this $14 dish to fill up. 

Pizza della Terra - $14 - (wild mushrooms, braised leeks, taleggio, truffle oil) Super rich and was proclaimed by my boo as possibly the best pizza he&#39;s ever had. It was very rich, but excellent nonetheless. 

Our bill came to just under $50 and while I could&#39;ve taken down another plate or two, the experience overall was a great one and I&#39;m excited to return when the weather warms (for real) and the patio opens."

Within no time of our arrival, the restaurant was packed with happy, smiling families, groups of friends and men in suits enjoying their time together.

However, though the ingredients are simple the flavors are not.  Everything was so fresh!  They literally burst in your mouth with that first bite.  I also wanted to order this to evaluate how Davanti would take a very traditional pizza and execute it because as simple as it is, I have had some less than delicious versions.  Davanti hit the nail on the head.  The crust was crispy on the outside and soft in the middle, the mozzarella was fresh and the basil plentiful.  The sauce was sweet and tart, truly a perfect harmony.

We also ordered the Cacio e Pepe: spaghetti, black pepper and pecorino.  PERFECTION.  The spaghetti was al dente, the fresh black pepper added a nice bite to the dish that balanced out the saltiness of the pecorino.  I could have eaten the whole plate by myself it was so good. The next pasta dish was the mushroom risotto. It was creamy and delicious.  I wish I could remember the mushrooms in the dish, but they had a wonderful earthy flavor with a meaty texture.  This dish was also a home run!

My friends ordered the special ragu of the day, which was polenta topped with some shredded pork.  I tried the polenta before they placed the pork on it and thought the polenta was some of the best that I have had.

Even the dessert did not disappoint.  First of all, we could have ordered everything! It was so hard to choose!  Eventually, we chose the hazelnut gelato cake concoction.  IT WAS TO DIE FOR!

Davanti lived up to all the hype and then some!"

It was our second visit to Devanti and after the first experience we reserved out seats. We waited for 20 mins past the scheduled time. It&#39;s Friday and people keep on walking in. As we were waiting we ordered for our drinks and the bartender offered it for FREE seeing us wait for so long. We enjoyed our vegetarian meal- Mediterranean humus, pizza rotollo, and the yummy dessert torta bacio. While we were waiting for our coffee, we were instead given the check. On asking for coffee, the waitress gave the coffee for FREE and asked for apology. 
So guys draw on your own conclusions, we like the place for the good drinks, good location, good food and a happy experience. :)"

First, a welcoming, professional staff couldn&#39;t do more to make sure we had exactly the table and location we wanted as we waffled back and forth on sitting in the dining room or at high tops in the bar area.  Cozy, rustic theme with stone, wood barn doors, wine racks throughout the dining area typical of a true Enoteca, which is basically a wine shop that features local wines and accompanying small plate cuisine. 

We settled down in the dining room, and it began!

Unbeknownst to us, Wed is half price wine night for wines up to $80.  So with a nice wine in hand, which they decanted for us, we ordered three home run dishes as follows: 1) Pizza della Terra - (wild mushrooms, braised leeks, taleggio, truffle oil), sensational!  Their changing polenta board featured a marscapone polenta with a generous portion of pulled pork shoulder in a rich, thick red sauce. delicious!  A wonderful farro salad accompanied a nice of delicious food and drink.

On the way out, we couldn&#39;t help but notice that the bar area had filled up with groups of elegant, beautiful women occupying the majority of tables.  There will be no waffling as to where we sit next time!!"

I took my special education classroom here for a field trip. The general manager, Michael McDermott, answered my many questions beforehand and helped us plan our field trip. All managers and wait staff were extremely helpful and friendly with the children. Our students were practicing their communication and social/emotional skills during this restaurant field trip. Many of my students are nonverbal and exchange pictures to communicate. Also, my students had to adapt to the change in their environment. We were given a private room, able to structure the room to meet our needs, and overall given any accommodations needed to help the students be successful. On the day of the field trip, the waitress was very patient when our students &#34;ordered&#34; their food with their words or pictures. She very competently handled the many parent and staff member&#39;s orders. The food was brought out in a timely manner and it was delicious! We do have several picky eaters and were able to order grilled cheeses, fries, and spaghetti for the kids. Plus, we have both an AM and a PM preschool special education class. The restaurant graciously opened at 10:00 am so that our morning class could gain this community experience too.

The host was very welcoming and since I arrived before my friend, they asked the name so they could direct them to my table. How fancy!

I had the Gnudi Pomodoro. It was ... GREAT... but so tiny for 14 bucks. 

It was served n a shallow bowl and the width of the food was less than 4 inches. ... depth oh, maybe slightly more than a inch? ( You can tell I&#39;m a scientist.)

I really really wanted it to be bigger so I felt like I had a full lunch. No bread was served to us. I guess thats normal?

Because of the tininess of my dish, I nibbled on my friend&#39;s Paccheri con Salsiccia e Pomodori al forno. It seemed like a larger dish and it was good- but the large chunks of onion and the tons of garlic were a bit overbearing. 

I would come back to try the &#34;cheese and cured meat&#34; selections. They looked really good."

Both times me and the wife have been here we left crazy happy on our food highs, maybe the bottle of Malbec helped too. They have a polenta board that changes daily although both times we came they had the same one, which would be a negative for most places but here it was so good that we ordered it again, creamy mascarpone polenta with a pork bolognese, I feel rich just thinking about it!!!

And the pizzas, also absurdly good.

While we were there, a crazy person that sat down behind me who was complaining about wanting a hamburger or some nonsense (don&#39;t get me wrong, I love burgers, but a tapas bar is neither the time or the place) he settled on the chicken which showed up just before we left, it sat there untouched for 10 minutes smelling brilliant, he was picking at the greens on the plate. People that don&#39;t care about food, should not be let into nice places.

Really for the burbs, and a chain, this place is a real find, great favors, that work great together, high quality ingredients all around worth going out of the way for! Unless you have a lack of taste buds, then go somewhere else."
davanti-enoteca-western-springs,Phyllis F.,wDltpEoVfSo4uWjzUEvpAQ,"Des Plaines, IL",0,1,0,0,9,XOAXHxOdtuqzUWayPxmcGw,1.0,2016-01-01,"I would like to rate this restaurant on several factors. First off, the food. Nowhere on their website do they tell you that this is a tapas/small plate restaurant.  So you think it&#39;s your usual mama mia&#39;s ristorante with plenty of food. Guess again. Don&#39;t expect any bread before your food. You get nothing. While the dishes we had (I had the Gnudi Pomodoro and a friend had the Pacceri con Sasiccia y Pomodoro al Forno) were described quite differently on the menu they had the exact same sauce. The waitress brought a dish to my place while I was washing my hands in the bathroom. When I dug into it, I realized it was not at all what I ordered but was my friend&#39;s. I was glad because the portion was tiny. Then mine was brought out. Same sauce!  It wasn&#39;t even tiny, it was minuscule!!  And to make matters worse, both dishes were lukewarm even though they were supposed to be brought as soon as they were ready, thus arriving separately. (&#34;What&#39;s in the olive salad?&#34; &#34;An olive.&#34; &#34;Just an olive?&#34; &#34;Yes, but it&#39;s a very good olive.&#34;) Summary: fairly good taste but not at all warm and too teeny tiny!

Next rating will be for the wait staff. I don&#39;t mind that the pace was slow. As a matter of fact, it made for a relaxing experience. However, the place was only half full and our waitress got our orders screwed up, was not interested in answering our questions (we only had a few, what with the menu being in Italian with incomplete translations), and basically acted like were there to interrupt her &#34;busy&#34; schedule. She (Katie) seldom returned to our table, taking lengthy times in between. We had to ask for grated cheese on our dishes. Refills of coffee occurred once. Soda never. Food was placed before us in a hurried sloppy half-caring manner. The whole &#34;why are you bothering me!&#34; vibe was strong with this one. We had asked for separate checks, but the whole meal was combined when the check arrived. We reminded her that we had asked for separate checks. She left to straighten it out and returned with the items completely messed up on both checks. We decided we&#39;d sort it out ourselves. Summary: why did I even bother you in the first place? Don&#39;t worry, it won&#39;t happen again. 

I want to speak about the prices. I have to say that this is one of those places where you pay through the nose and then end up going somewhere else to eat when you leave because you&#39;re still very hungry. It was the highest price I have paid for the least amount of food in any restaurant ever. You are not advised anywhere on their website that this is a tapas/small plate Italian joint. I should have stayed home and bought a jar of expensive American beluga caviar ($1,399.95 for 14 ounces), served myself with a smile, and I would have enjoyed the experience a heck of a lot more. Summary: buy a jar of expensive beluga caviar and spare the bad experience. Or just go to Culver&#39;s, like we did afterwards, and don&#39;t leave hungry.

The final comments are on the atmosphere. While it&#39;s dressed up like it&#39;s a high end restaurant, it misses the mark. The floors weren&#39;t especially clean. The glasses and menus are sloppily plopped on the tables in front of you. The wait staff, or at least some of them, our waitress in particular, did not have manners or patience to effect the attempted high class atmosphere. The table we sat at was lopsided and wobbled throughout the meal. The menu was in Italian with a translation page of some of the words but not all. If you don&#39;t speak fluent Italian, don&#39;t ask Katie for a translation because it will impinge on her &#34;I&#39;m overly busy&#34; attitude. (I have waitressed before at a very busy restaurant, dear!) Summary: for a better time, consider some other restaurant for a lot less money, better service, nicer atmosphere, and equally good food. Or buy yourself a jar of American beluga caviar at an extreme high price, stay at home, and enjoy your own self service."

The daily polenta is excellent and they also have a delicious burger. Recently we wandered in for Sunday brunch. Bloody Mary bar? Don&#39;t mind if I do!!!! Nice presentation and accoutrements! The coffee was yummy- rich and robust not like the thin brown water at most diners. I ordered the pork belly hash and although my eggs came with the hollandaise on- when I asked for on the side it was good- not thick and salty goo like most but light with a slightly lemony taste. The hubby had the steak and scrambled eggs commenting he had never had such creamy yummy eggs- and the steak was tender juicy deliciousness- had to beg for a second taste. Good potatoes on the side. The bill is definitely higher than other local breakfast places but the quality and creativeness of the food is worth it.

We shared several dishes.  the bruschetta special was just ok - the peppers overpowered the cheese. The mascarpone polenta special, with pork belly ragu was really good. Great flavors and textures, and not something you see every day. The Gnudi pomodoro was our favorite. Similar to gnocchi, the dumplings were tender and very flavorful.

For the portion size, this restaurant was too expensive. Be prepared to be hungry after you eat your meal if you happen to order pasta. Spent 16$ for a dish that could of easily been considered a side. $18 for a 8 oz. glass of wine? Please. I get that this is western springs, but come on. 

Also, their gluten free menu is nothing more than a regular menu with highlighted sections in different color marker to indicate if this item is &#34;gluten-free&#34; or not. Why not just print a separate menu since I&#39;m paying $100+ for a meal here? Food was brought out a different times, too so be prepared to sit there awkwardly and wait for the other dishes to come out.

Try to make any modifications to your meal and these will need to be approved by the chef. I wanted a different sauce on my pasta and was turned down. I didn&#39;t realize the chef was pitching in for my meal.

My first visit was great!  And even on a Tuesday night- this place was hopping!  Make reservations or you may find yourself with a huge wait!

We were seated at a two top high top by the window in the bar area.  The perfect table.  Our server, Joe, came over then and he turned out to be the perfect server.  Attentive, personable, knowledgeable and funny!  All things that went a long way in making our evening just that much more special!

We ordered simply- the cauliflower appetizer and  the goat cheese stuffed foccacia de recco which , with it&#39;s honeycombs to smear honey over the thing - should really be listed as a dessert.  That focaccia is out of the this world- but I wish they would do a half size portion as there is never any way to finish it given how rich it is.

For my entree- I always have the chili paste chicken which is a whole half a chicken and plenty to share.  Speaking of sharing- the menu is set up to do just that but you may like your entree so much that you keep it all to yourself!  I&#39;ve also had the hangar steak which is also quite good.

The wine list is quite robust, and here again, our server went out of his way to make sure we were happy with our selections.  And if you drive (it&#39;s in the Burbs so that&#39;s probably likely although the Metra train stops nearby) there is a private free parking lot on the north side of the building.

While there have been a range of restaurants in this place, I am hopeful that this one will stick.  I like that you can come by for a business lunch- grab a glass of wine and some cheese with friends after work, have brunch on the weekends or have a complete meal at night.  It&#39;s just that kind of restaurant that should meet a wide range of eating occasions.

All in all a great addition to the Western Burbs."

I called on a Saturday afternoon and was able to make a same night reservation for 8:45 PM, which surprised me, but I was so excited, none the less.

We arrived to this brand new location (opened April 5th) in downtown Western Springs just North of the train tracks on Hillgrove Ave. and Wolf Rd. at around 8:15 so we were told we would be seated a little closer to our reservation time, which was fine because Fred and Kevin wanted to grab a drink anyways.  So they grabbed a drink at the bar while I just looked around and took in all the unique light fixtures and of course, checked out all the fabulous food walking by.  Yum.

We had been waiting over 55 min. (25 min. AFTER our reservation time) and I honestly was getting upset because I feel that reservations have a purpose but I do understand that people sometimes just don&#39;t like to get up, which was the case last night.  So finally, at this time, one of the hosts came over and offered to buy us all a drink since we had been waiting so long, which already starting winning be back.  I am a sucker for customer service and appreciation, so that was impressive.  We were then seated within 5 minutes of getting those drinks and were told after being seated that we were getting not one, but two appetizers on the house for our trouble.  Seriously.  That was way more than I ever would have expected and was MUCH appreciated!!

Our server came over to greet us and she was SUPER friendly and very enthusiastic about the menu items, which just makes me happy because I could talk about food all day!  So her and I were a perfect fit! =]

On top of the two free items, we ended up ordering like 6 more items, I will break them down individually since they were that good.

Farro Salad (Free Item) - Farro, Roasted Butternut Squash, Hazelnuts, Watercress, Goat Cheese and a Apple Cider Viniagerette.  This dish was my favorite of the night.  Hands Down.  The flavors were perfection and the nutty chewiness of the farro was so refreshing, something I probably would have never ordered but now will order every time!!

Taleggio Vasi (Free Item) - Melted Taleggio Cheese, Grapes and Black Truffle.  This was gooey, cheesy meltiness with the Earthiness of that truffle paste and the sweetness of the grapes.  It just worked.  So flavorful and rich.

Ricotta Vasi - Whipped Ricotta with Olive Oil, Salt, Pepper and Honeycomb.  This is one of the best spreads I&#39;ve ever had.  So creamy, cold and satisfying.  And the perfectly oiled and toasted Italian bread that is served with it could be a meal in and of itself!  Best.Bread.Ever.  Fabulous!

Roasted Beet Salad - Beets, Walnut Butter, Crema and Candied Walnuts.  This salad is the perfect balance of flavors and textures.  Cool and tender beets with that slightly warmed butter mixed with the cold cream.  Honestly, it&#39;s perfection.  So much so, that I have re-created it at home and didn&#39;t change much because it is so spot on!

Pizza Giardiniera - Super crisp crust with Ricotta, Homemade Sausage (which was super light and flavorful) and a very light giardiniera of carrots and cauliflower.  The pizza was good, but since everything else is on a totally different playing field, it&#39;s not something I would come here for.

Ragu of the Day - Braised Pork Shoulder (whatever they have that day) over Mascarpone Creamy Polenta.  It tastes JUST like my grandma&#39;s pot roast.  Super tender meat and creamy, cheesy polenta.  You really can&#39;t go wrong, another winner!

Cacio e Pepe - Simple.  Spaghetti, Pecorino, Butter, Salt &amp; Pepper (lots).  This is one of my favorite pastas I&#39;ve ever had.  So simple but done with such perfection, you will try it, and you will be addicted.  End of story.

Risotto Carbonara - Al Dente Risotto, Peas, Pancetta, Cheese and topped with an egg yolk to stir in just before eating.  Simple, absolutely delicious, perfectly seasoned and genius.  So old world style which I LOVE!

That&#39;s all we got, just a short little list, right?!?! =]]  Honestly though, our friend said he would love to be able to just pop in here for lunch during the week for lunch (but he works WAY too far from here) because he loved the freshness of everything and tried lots of items he has never had and was SUPER impressed.  We will all back, very soon and very often!  Thanks Davanti for another great experience, this time in a new location.  Bringing a little sexiness over to the suburbs."

I&#39;ve been wanting to try this place after driving by it a few times on my way home from work.

We were seated promptly and got the choice of the bar area or dining room - we chose the dining room. We ordered the meat and cheese platter (I asked the waitress to make her picks for us). Prosciutto, as always, was fabulous and nice and salty, but not overwhelming. The two cheeses were mild but smooth. Very good choices! I can&#39;t complain as I allowed her to choose for us.

The bread is nice and toasty (looks like they butter and toast it). It came out sort of late... we were done eating our meat and cheese at that point. It would be nice if the bread would come out upon seating guests. I would have liked fresh bread vs. toasted, but that&#39;s a personal preference.

For dinner, I had the pizza w/ prosciutto, the guys had burgers (which they raved about - fries were super crispy!!), the girls had the seafood linguine and the big ravioli w/ egg (DELICIOUS!!!)

We got the apple caramel dessert and the chocolate mousse. It was sooo soo good. Not overwhelmingly sweet... actually a nice, dark chocolate taste.

The buffet was extensive and very good. Just the cold half of the buffet was fantastic. Highlights were the pea tendril salad with rock shrimp and the roasted vegetables. Yum. The hot part of the buffet was also delicious. I enjoyed the risotto, eggs Benedict, and bacon. The lamb saddle and prime rib at the carving station were both perfectly cooked. The brunch also included mimosas and made-to-order frittatas. Overall, a very good brunch at Davanti. I understand they only offer the buffet on holidays, so it&#39;s definitely worth coming by for a special occasion."

This Italian wine &amp; small portion (think tapas) style restaurant is a hidden gem. Treat yourself. All the food is amazing.  The pork shoulder ragu and cauliflower steak were two instant favorites as well.

We made a reservation through Open Table for 7:45 pm. We showed up and the hostess said they were running behind and should be able to seat our group of 4 in about 10 minutes. Ironically as we waiting in the lobby, there was a sign that said they don&#39;t take reservations....  After 15 minutes I approached the hostess stand and she continued to ignore me and wouldn&#39;t look up from her computer until one of the managers finally acknowledged me and said, oh we are just getting your table ready now.  Not a great first impression to this restaurant. 

We were seated at a table and the dining room was extremely busy and loud. The ladies at the table next to us were so close and loud it was hard to hear anything but her booming voice.  The waitress them came over and asked for our drink order. She was obviously disappointed we didn&#39;t order wine because she promptly walked away from the table and did not come back for at least 15 minutes. We finally had to ask the water guy to please send the waitress over as we were all more than ready to place our orders.  The waitress took our orders but did not write anything down. I immediately knew we were going to have issues getting what we had ordered.  We had four different dishes and a meat and cheese platter with a variety of specifically selected items. After the last order was taken she said, well everything here is a small plate and you should just share the dishes. Well, this information would have been really helpful to know BEFORE we ordered as two of us ended up ordering the same dish.  She walked away before we could change our orders. 

The appetizer arrived about 10 minutes later. The bruschetta was roasted cauliflower with onions and a mild cheese. It was very bland and totally flavorless. A total bore of an appetizer. 

Not long after, the first dish was brought out. It was a butternut squash salad that none of us had ordered. We let the male server know it wasn&#39;t for our table. He came back and said that it was ours and that sometimes people order the wrong thing. My sister insisted she ordered the butternut squash ravioli and not a salad. He continued to sternly tell my sister she must be confused because she ordered it. We were astounded that this male sever who delivered the food would say that because he did not take the order nor had our waitress written down the order. We all heard her order the ravioli and even the waitress verbally said the ravioli when she repeated it back to confirm the order. It should be a standard practice to write down orders at this establishment as our server screwed up 2 of our 4 dishes. Our waitress them came back over to the table, whisked the salad away and presented it to the table next to us as a complimentary salad and told my sister her ravioli was on its way.  Very odd to witness her taking a plate from our table and kindly offering it to the table next to us. 

My husbands meat and cheese platter showed up next and I had the skirt steak,as did my mother. The steak was actually very delicious and tastefully prepared.  The ravioli dish came out about 10 minutes later and it was definitely not worth the wait. The dish came out with ONE ravioli on the plate and it was stuffed with spinach and not with butternut squash as the menu describes.  It was pretty bland. I had better butternut squash at Panera bread yesterday. They stuff their ravioli with actual butternut squash too and not spinach but then try and call it butternut squash ravioli... There was nothing butternut squash about this single ravioli. 

After the meal the waitress came over to ask how everything was. She never bothered to check in until the food was gone and our plates were cleared. My husband then said the cheese and meat platter she brought us wasn&#39;t the combination he ordered. She then explained, yes, I know they took your cheese tray to the wrong table and you received their tray. So there was a mix up and she knew the whole time and wasn&#39;t going to say anything!!!  I couldn&#39;t believe it!!!  She was just hoping he wouldn&#39;t notice the mix up. She then insisted that she make up the platter he originally ordered to go.  By that point we were all so annoyed with the attitudes and deceitfulness.  This restaurant was a complete disaster from the moment we walked through the door.

There were so many opportunities for the hostess, our server, the male server that persistently insisted we didn&#39;t know what we ordered to be friendly, nice and honest. But they all chose to instead be cold, aloof, dishonest and accusatory. This place was a total disaster from start to finish.  I expected so much more from this Scott Harris restaurant.  A total disappointment."

We love Davanti and have been repeat customers at the two other locations.  So we jumped at the opportunity when visiting friends suggested we meet at the Western Springs restaurant.  Decor and menu are the same as other Davanti locations, but the service....really poked along.  George, our server, visited us once, but early indecision on our part apparently banished us to hunger siberia - he didn&#39;t come back.  Another server, Angel, eventually took pity on us and brought drinks, but dinner took a looong time.  As we were with friends, and the food was excellent when it finally came, we didn&#39;t mind much, but our tip which reflected the service (just over 10%).  We DID mind, however, when the charge came through on our credit card, 3 times what I had signed off on  Don&#39;t know what happened, and we&#39;ve challenged the charge, but the whole experience has tarnished Davanti&#39;s reputation for us.

The buffet though is excellent.  The chilled food section is great.  There are wood-oven grilled vegetables, caprese salad, beet salad with goat cheese, a kale Caesar salad, and an excellent pea-tendril/arugula/rock shrimp salad.  Some nice charcuterie and cheeses are also there and black-truffle deviled eggs.  Yum.  The hot foods were also very good and included risotto (soggy), some very nice bacon, eggs Benedict, and delicious roast lamb loin and salt-crusted prime rib.  The sweets section featured excellent key lime pie, chocolate mousse tart and some cookies and hand-pies.

I&#39;m not looking for a place to bring babies and toddlers, but kids who actually eat food.  This place is not for them.  Adults can already go to a bistro with a name they can&#39;t even pronounce if they want to, so how about a place for everyone who has an appetite?

So if you aren&#39;t very hungry and have a lot of extra money, this is the place for you.  The special - the polenta and braised pork in tomato sauce.  Let&#39;s see - 4 scoops of essentially cornmeal with some cheese mixed in, spread out on a board and anointed with 4-5 ladles of the sauce - thats $18.  Really?  R u kidding?   I ate it with threes slurps.  Share it and everyone gets 2 tablespoonfuls.  Pepperoni and kale pizza was unremarkable - there are 2-3 other woodfired pizza places within 10 minutes just as good if not better.  Veal meatballs and prosciutto - run of the mill.  Wine pours - lets see huge glass, small flask, embarrasing combination.  Some sea urchin and crab linguine thing was fairly tasteless for $15 with enough crab to fill a large thimble.  Ricotta dumplings in tomato sauce - again unremarkable.

Personally, I call bullshit, because I can get squash at the store still.  I actually whined, begged and pouty-faced the waitress, the chef and anyone that would listen (i.e. my husband at the table the entire time).  

Now, maybe my view was tainted because of the farro incident, but this was definitely an off night for them.  I &#34;settled&#34; for the risotto carbonara and which last time it was perfect, this time, the risotto was seriously undercooked.  And the pork shoulder ragout wasn&#39;t nearly as tender as usual.  I found one piece inedible.  Hubby ordered the ribeye and to me, it looked disgusting.

Well, there&#39;s one glaring issue that bumps this place down to a 3 star rating. It was the pizza. We got a Margarita Pizza and it took FOREVER. All the other dishes were very timely. It felt like they forgot about the pizza. But the biggest issue? The crust was downright the worst I&#39;ve ever had from a (sit-down) Italian restaurant. It had the flavor of those plain crackers that they serve on airplanes, and it was a complete contrast to the soft inner portion of the pizza that needed to be folded to be eaten. The crust, however, was so stiff that it didn&#39;t want to fold. It would just crumble and make a huge mess. I&#39;m sorry, but an Italian restaurant that can&#39;t make pizza properly is not a restaurant that I&#39;m going back to, great service or not. That&#39;s just inexcusable."

I was excited to try it out, and more excited for my family to try it. My father is off-the-boat Italian, and I thought this might be a great place for him!

First they brought the wrong bottle of wine out, which took at least 15 minutes to get to the table. Then we ordered a different bottle because apparently the one we wanted was out of stock, and it took another 15 minutes for it to arrive. They stuck our large party (10 people) in the back room (which doesn&#39;t get cell phone reception), and kind of forgot about us. 

The food came out sporadically, and was ok at best. You are better off going to Brookhaven Foods for better deli meats, at least that&#39;s what my father said!

The polenta was not good either. I grew up eating polenta regularly, and when they brought it out, all of us thought, &#34;What is this crap?!?&#34;  

The service was absolutely lousy. It felt like the waiter knew he could ignore us because he would still get his 20% tip due to the size of the party. I would not go back, and neither would anyone else in my family.  

I expected more from them, especially since this is a sister restaurant to Francesca&#39;s, which I&#39;ve always had good experiences with.

The wait staff is very friendly, helpful and very willing to make a lunch that you will enjoy.  I always order from their lunch menu which has numerous option for $7.95.  I&#39;ve gotten Kung Pao Chicken. Sweet and Sour chicken, General Tso Chicken. And sesame chicken.... all have been excellent!  Each lunch enter comes with soup or salad, 1 spring roll, your entire choice, and rice, fried, or brown rice."

There were many open tables but there were a bunch people picking up to go orders. The service was very chaotic--we were standing there for a good 10 minutes waiting to be seated and there were workers looking at us but we were left standing around. The sushi was very mediocre...will not be ordering it again. However, the beef noodle soup was enjoyable. Their menu is very expansive so if I do make a return trip back here, I will opt for the other items on the menu."

The food was ready on time so that was good but the food was just ok.

I couldnt tell the difference between the orange chicken and the general tso, they tasted pretty much the same. At times i could taste a hint of orange flavoring on the orange chicken. The pad thai was overly sweet, ive diffenitely have tasted better.  The sushi rolls werent that great either, marianos sushi is better, and thats sad. 

The only thing i absolutely loved was the fried rice, ill probably give it another try and skip the sushi and pad thai."

Unfortunately, there isn&#39;t too much to really fall in love with here. I&#39;ve ordered multiple times and here are my thoughts.

Good packaging on their carry out orders. 

Friendly staff and nice dining area. 

There&#39;s not a lot of meat in their dishes. I would expect at least double the amount than what they use. 

They don&#39;t give you much on carry outs. Ordered 4 dishes and only received 2 soy sauces and two fortune cookies. 

Bottom line, they cut corners wherever they can, especially on their carry out orders. There are better places to go."

What I can say about Lu&#39;s is not only is the food amazing, but the services is top notch as well.  The combination of these two factors is what keeps me driving back to Wheaton.  

One of my favorite Asia restaurants has been Yu&#39;s Mandarin in Schaumburg. While the food is always good, the services is very poor.  Because of this, I don&#39;t go there any longer. 

OK, so here are my recent favorite things:  Sushi:  Every roll I&#39;ve had has been fresh and delicious!  Entree:  I am a huge vegetable fan and seem to migrate to the Shrimp and Vegetable dish.  All of the vegetables are cooked with a bit of crunch!  The Goyza is amazing.

First off when we went in the door my mother and sister only ate there one other time and they noticed who they were and welcomed them back. Very nice and shows they really care about their customers. We ordered the crab rangoon for a starter and they are great here. The dough is nice and light and they have great flavor. You can tell they are homemade. For my main entree I had shrimp tempura sushi. It was very good. The rice was nice and warm so I can tell it was made fresh also. Looking forward to going back and trying some of the other dishes. The crispy beef sounds really good may have to try that next time.

They said they would not gove us the soup or salad unless we dined in and would not give the spring roll either.  Didnt even try and compensate us at all with a cheaper price or even attempt to make it the 1 time.  Highly not satisfied.

Have been looking for a good sushi place for a long time now.  These guys do a great job and are very traditional in ordering.  I like to just sit at the sushi bar and order from the chef without having to go through a server.  That way I get feedback and suggestions on what to try and what is good.  That is how they work at this place and they have some fantastic creations that I probably not have tried if I was just ordering from a server.  If you are lucky and they are making them, I highly suggest the spicy tuna on tortilla chips (see photo).  OMG, I could eat three orders of those alone, they are just that good!

Only reason they are not 5 star is that they are a little pricey, but, I guess you can&#39;t have everything. Plus, the better the sushi is, the more you order, right?"

I ordered 2 sushi rolls which were part of the lunch special as well as a pad Thai noodle. Did I forget to mention they threw in a free order of crab Rangoon?! It was so good they should have charged me for them lol.

I like to get the lunch special on weekdays.  It&#39;s a good deal, but if you carry out, you don&#39;t get soup which is a big disappointment.  

But today was a real, disappointing eye-opener.  It&#39;s the day AFTER Thanksgiving, and I called to order the lunch special. &#34;Sorry, no lunch special on holidays&#34;.  Really?  Since when is the day AFTER Thanksgiving a holiday?  It&#39;s not, according to my calendar. Black Friday is an accounting phrase and a marketing tactic, not a holiday. 

The menu says the lunch special is offered Monday thru Friday except holidays.  I argued with the person on the phone, but they kept insisting that today was a holiday and the manager was &#34;not available&#34;  I&#39;ve been going to this business since before they moved last year, but something like this really rubs me the wrong way.

We went there only once, for the first time yesterday, so we&#39;ll need to try them several times before determining if they are the best or not.

All elements of our dishes were excellent. The vegetables were fresh and cooked just right.  The handmade chow fun noodles were superb!  We used to think that House of Emperor in Naperville was the best in the area but they stopped making their own noodles and have cut back on other ingredients and procedures, and despite those decreases in quality, they raised prices.

The food came out of the kitchen very fast, which tells us they know what they are doing and are adequately staffed.

We had a sense that management was keeping a close eye on everything. 

We also really appreciate it that they don&#39;t use MSG.

We started with some pork egg rolls.  Very good.  The presentation on the dishes is beautiful.  My wonton soup was a very flavorful broth with wonton, some veggies and scallions.  The hot and sour soup was also very flavorful and not gelatinous.  Both were HOT when served.  A pet peeve of ours is soup that is not hot when served.

Next we had Mongolian Beef and Vegetable Delight.  Mongolian Beef is my test dish when we try a new Chinese place.  This one was excellent.  It was loaded with flavor.  The sauce wasn&#39;t dark and gloppy as in some other places.  The beef was tender.  The Vegetable Delight was also flavorful.  The veggies were obviously fresh.  Both entree portions were large and worth the price.  I am looking forward to the leftovers tomorrow.

The service was excellent.  Everybody was smiling and helpful.  Our server, Yao Yao, came over several times to make sure everything was to our liking.  Water was refilled and dirty plates were removed promptly.

Ambiance/decor is nice.  They don&#39;t have lunch specials on the weekends, but that isn&#39;t too surprising I guess.  I ordered a house salad and two rolls - Avocado Maki and Ebi Ten Maki (shrimp tempura). I asked if I could have them inside out, and they charged me an extra dollar per roll for that. Why? There was no substitution or add-on, just the same ingredients rolled in a different order. I order my rolls inside out at every sushi place I go to - chains and independent places alike - and this is the first time I&#39;ve ever been charged extra anywhere! My husband got the Beef Pan Fried Noodles. I gave two stars because the food was good (nothing amazing or out of the ordinary though).  I hope the $2 was worth losing customers, because we most likely won&#39;t be returning. What a shame that they seem to nickel and dime customers at the expense of losing them!"

As a matter of fact, I would say the Fried Rice is the best in the area.  Large pieces of chicken and very fresh.  My only complaint was that I did not get the egg rolls.  Instead, I got Pot Stickers.  I am not a huge fan of Pot Stickers, but they weren&#39;t bad...just not what I ordered.  I will definitely go back and would recommend."

I&#39;ve been to the old location, the new location and picked up take out and all experiences were great. Twice cooked pork was great, Hunan beef was especially good after I asked for it extra spicy. Tried several pieces of sushi and it was pretty good for a small place in the suburbs. Service is great and very friendly. Even when they were packed at their new location two weeks ago we were seated and served quickly. The price is pretty reasonable for the amount of food we got. We each ordered a drink, a soup, split the spring rolls and an entr√©e each and the bill came to just over $50 before, plus we each took home enough for another meal.

We went 2 weeks ago and I&#39;ve been pestering my boyfriend about going back ever since. We got the mixed seafood in garlic butter. I wish there was bread to sop up all the extra garlicky goodness. We did order a side of sauce so my boyfriend could have the hot sauce, I think it was a couple bucks which is a lot but you do get a pretty good amount of the sauce. We also got the appetizer of the garlic Parmesan fries, they were great. Next time I think we&#39;ll just go with the crab and shrimp, the muscles were good but the crab and shrimp were so much better. 

Another plus was the atmosphere, everyone was really friendly and super smiley. It was almost like they pumped Prozac through the air there because everyone was so dang happy. They had a singer and keyboard player, and while the music was a little loud, it was really good. Everybody was really getting into the music, it was funny to see people with messy crabby hands dancing in their seats. It made everything a lot of fun."

Ordering was a bit weird you have to order each number of potatoe, corn on cob and sausage you want in your meal. We got the medley which came with half a crab, about 8 whole shrimp and a ton of muscles. We had it in the mild cajun spice and it was the perfect amount of kick. The music choice playing was a bit weird...80s. Definitely could pump in some zydeco and jazz to make the atmosphere more realistic. Eating to Def Leppard and Betty Davis eyes was kinda strange. Craft brew on bottles but they missed a perfect one for this establishment, Abita. Some cold Andygator or Purple Haze would have been a perfect pairing.
 White wax paper covered tables and eating with hands adds to the realism of a true crab boil. Loved sitting at the &#34;picnic&#34; tables too. Almost felt like being back in the bayou.

I first had them via takeout for my sister in law&#39;s birthday dinner.  Even takeout from Woodridge to Villa Park was on point!  

This is a smallish, hole in the wall type restaurant in a strip mall on Route 53.  You get seated at picnic style tables with an entire roll of paper towel on it, good thing too, cause this shit gets messy in the best possible way!!

We had the kids with us, so we ordered them calamari and fries, calamari was delicious!  We ordered 1 lb. of mussels in their Cajun (hot) and 2 lb. of their shell on, headless shrimp in lemon pepper.  Let me explain these to you...they do their seafood in the traditional Louisiana seafood boil manner and then add their signature, butter drenched sauces and shake it all in a plastic bad and serve in said bag.  Bomb.  Pure amazingness!  We also ordered some garlic bread to sop up that delicious sauce.  Omg.  I can&#39;t say enough good things about this place.

We had Mussels, Shrimp, and snow carb. 

Tried the Ultimate and Cajun seasonings. The ultimate was not really good it was average at best. The Cajun was right on point.

The mussels were small, the snow carb tasted incredibly watery and the shrimp were ok.

The level of seafood is not on par with the other places with the same concept. The snow crab was way to watery like they didn&#39;t take the time to taw it out properly before cooking. 

The mussels were small and a bit fishy they were not the best quality. The shrimp were good but I didn&#39;t really feel like I got and entire lb in my bag. Compared to other places the bags seem a bit light in my opinion.

The Pilipino ice cream was awesome. I only found out it was Pilipino because the texture was different and the taste was awesome. 

The service, ice cream and Cajun Shrimp will warrant another visit to this place if I was in the area."

Once you get past the eating everything with your hands the food and flavors are quite good.  We ordered  crab legs in garlic butter sauce and shrimp with Ultimate sauce (medium).  Next time I&#39;ll kick it up a notch and go with spicy. Alsk ordered corn on the cob, potatoes and sausage sides.  All good!

My only knock is that each diner is given.a small plastic container containg a TINY amount ofvsalt and pepper.  Firstly, the seasonings are adequate that additional seasoning is unnecessary.   Secondly, all those containers probably end up in a landfill.  I&#39;d rather they simply state that salt and pepper are available on request. 

They also have full bar service with a modest selection of bottled beers.  I opted for Duval which paired nicely with the food.

I&#39;ll definitely be back."

I&#39;ll note that this place seems to be more spaced out than the location in Skokie. Secondly, pop rocks galore (if you understand it, you will, if not, move on). The prices are pretty standard. We did not have to wait an hour like we did previously up north as well. Their menu consists of crawfish, crab legs (both snow and king), lobster, mussels, oysters (raw), and the usual of sausage, potatoes and corn. 

We ordered the latter minus the lobster, mussels and oysters. The food came out semi-quick and with our side of cajun fries, I would say the overall taste was pretty good. I would say though the crawfish while most were fresh, there were definitely a few that were DOA. Service is okay, not the best, but definitely not too bad - they do have a bar here but it seems that most people were comfortable drinking from the &#39;bottomless&#39; drink menu which consists of your usual soft drinks and water.

Not sure if we ordered less than when we went up north to the Boiling Crab &amp; Crawfish up in Skokie but the bill for the three of us was just shy of $120, not bad considering our bill for just the two of us at the Boiling Crab &amp; Crawfish was pretty much the same amount. I see that as value.

Overall, would come here again, the location provides ample parking as it is in a strip mall (where the old Clara&#39;s Italian Restaurant used to be- which now relocated down the street to where Krispy Kreme used to be). 

I&#39;m quite surprised they did not have gumbo soup, but they did have lobster bisque - I think this may be because it&#39;s based off of their &#34;Soup of the day&#34; type of thing.. who knows?"

Although I agree with other reviewers that the food was fresh - especially given that we visited at 8pm on a Sunday night - it was hard to get past the unusual set-up to really enjoy our dining experience.  There are sinks in the dining area for customers to wash hands.  I guess the owner doesn&#39;t want buttery fingers on the bathroom doorknobs.  Additionally there are only plastic spoons and forks to enjoy the side dishes.  We enjoyed the lobster bisque starter and shellfish medley for dinner with sausage &amp; potatoes all served in a plastic steam bag.

It isn&#39;t the freshest, best seafood that you are even going to have. However, for what it is and the price - it&#39;s pretty good. The concept is cool - pick your food and eat the food in a bag with your hands. Get super messy. 

The first time, we had a great waitress. She was knowledgeable about the items on the menu and even suggested mixing salt, pepper and lime juice for an awesome dipping sauce that I will forever use. She suggested the snow crab over the king crab - she said it tasted better and was less expensive. I got it and it was very good - but I needed more. On my second visit I got 2 pounds and that seems to be the right amount of snow crab if that is all I am eating. My hubby had the head on shrimp and mussels - I tried both and those were also good, but the crabs have my heart. I did the three sauces mixed together with medium spice; perfect. We tried the garlic bread and sweet potato fries - just okay, but the seafood is what shines here. Great addition to the neighborhood, can&#39;t wait to come back.

This should go without saying, but prepare to get messy."

I liked both but ultimate cajun is unique in that you can get garlic butter everywhere. The only thing was between the two of us, my husband was still hungry afterwards. He said next time he will order more rice to bulk up.  It&#39;s definitely not cheap but totally worth it."

One night my dad and I were looking for some dinner in the area, and decided to try this place out. The space where Crab &amp; Spice is, used to be an Italian restaurant we used to frequent before it moved (Claras). It was kind of neat to see how much differently the space looked after the remodel.  The restaurant is very casual and low key. 

Upon glancing at the market prices for the different types of seafood on the menu, the prices seemed pretty reasonable for the amount of seafood you get. I opted for the crab legs with the 3 standard sauces mixed together. I also ordered a piece of sausage and garlic bread. The seafood here comes in a plastic bag, and they give you a bib in order to spare your clothes. The 3 sauces mixed together with the crab legs was an excellent choice. I loved the crab legs, and the sausage and garlic bread was fine.  

The food was memorable, but the staff here was just pretty average and non memorable. Our waiter didn&#39;t have much enthusiasm, and was hard to find when we were looking for our check. If you enjoy flavorful seafood, Crab &amp; Spice is a good option in the Woodridge/Naperville area."

The crab and shrimp were terribly over-cooked and the sauce is a watered-down imitation of spices at best! The staff is nice, the space is small but pleasurable and again the bartender is spot on!

crab-and-spice-woodridge,Elle N.,VCsI3ZOGK3M1Ti-tcfVf7A,"Downers Grove, IL",0,1,0,5,6,48Ojxsd4u4P2xgsgHrk55Q,4.0,2016-08-24,"Crab &amp; Spice does not take reservations. It&#39;s not really a big deal on a weekday but on the weekends it does get crowded and there will probably be a wait. Tables are set up picnic-style and there&#39;s easy options for groups of two through four. Unless you sit three across on a bench (which might get tight if you&#39;re an adult) you may end up having to look at combining two tables. We didn&#39;t see that happening when we were there last night, but I presume that&#39;s how they accommodate larger groups. 

The ambiance is fun. They play top-twenties music so it feels modern, the wax-paper covered picnic tables and rather sparse interior feels practical and quaint rather than barren, cheap, and outdated. Lack of silverware and plates further contribute to this.

Crab &amp; Spice is finger-food, full-stop. If you order potato(s) in your bag, they will come whole.  You have to break them up yourself. Rice comes in a Styrofoam bowl with a spoon (not really practical for sharing). 

Prices are neither more expensive or less expensive than other assorted seafood restaurants: your mileage may vary if you think this is worth it (as there&#39;s no dishes, etc). Everything is an &#34;extra&#34; - potatoes, corn, and sausage you put in the bag is something like 75cents per piece. Rice, garlic bread, fries, etc, are around $2/per order. As the seafood was pretty much at a standard price for every-where else (that would also include sides at the cost), I felt slightly nickel and dimed by the experience.

The smallest order of seafood you can get is a pound. The spices are serious - the medium Cajun spice was delicious, but still a little much (even for us, who tend to be fans of spicy foods). Mild next time. The sweet potato fries and the Cajun fries were both fantastic. 

All in all? This is less of a &#34;dining out&#34; night and more of an &#34;event&#34; for a night out. Having to disassemble seafood to eat really prolongs dinner and makes it easy to chat with people (and have fun with it)."

We were welcomed by the proprietor Ron and his wife for lunch who explained to us cuisine that inspired them. It is mostly Cajun with very fresh seafood in a very minimalist setting. you pick your choice of seafood in increments of lbs and they cook it with your choice of seasoning.  We didn&#39;t know what to pick so we choose a 2 lbs of seafood medley (split with my wife) in hot Cajun seasoning with some corn and rice.

It was a delicious and interesting meal, albeit a bit messy.  So it you are not used to eating seafood with your hands (or suffer from OCD) this might not be a place for you.  But if you like to support new sort of food experiences in the suburbs and new entrepreneurs, then you should certainly stop by to support Ron and his team.  Let&#39;s spread the word .."

I&#39;m so happy I found this place while visiting the Bolingbrook area for work. It&#39;s located in a little strip mall and doesn&#39;t look like much from the outside but it&#39;s great inside. my waitress Betzy was very nice and attentive but not overbearing. She explained the menu to me and how everything worked. You have to order the seafood by the pound. I decided to get the shellfish medley that included crab, head on shrimp and mussels. Of course they loaded it up with the most mussels and then quite a few shrimp and a cluster of crab legs. I got the Ultimate sauce which is a combination of all 3 sauces (garlic butter, lemon pepper and cajun) it was soooo good. I got it in a medium spice. I also added an ear of corn and the garlic parmesan fries. The food came pretty quickly and one bite I was in love. It&#39;s served in a plastic bag and you eat with your hands, which is fun. The shellfish medley came with 2 pounds of food! I was stuffed by the end. for 30 dollars all together, I was happy. I am already planning to go back before I go back to Michigan. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because my shrimp seemed just slightly overcooked and I can&#39;t give 4.5 stars like I wanted to."

This place had great food and exceeded our expectations. All the shellfish was very fresh. We ordered 2lbs shrimp, 1lb snow crab legs, and a two pound lobster. The garlic butter was a great marinade. The lemon pepper was a bit strong for our tastes. Will probably go with all garlic butter next time. 

You can tell this place is Filipino owned. They served rice and had vinegar with garlic. These two items really pleased and elevated my mothers experience. 

The general manager RJ was great. He stopped by our table quite a few times to check on us, he answered all of our questions, and seemed pretty attentive to everything that was going on within the restaurant.

Well, she should have brought you here. This place is a joy, and a genuinely unusual dining experience - it&#39;s more like going to a cookout or a luau than to a restaurant.

You eat with your hands, and there&#39;s a whole roll of paper towels on the picnic-style table. Be sure to order some rice or garlic bread to soak up the extra sauce, because it really is that good. It also get splashed around, so do *not* wear your fancy clothes to Crab &amp; Spice, and short sleeves are recommended.

Some things they could work on:
1) communication between hostess and waiter/waitress. We thought the hostess was our waitress she introduced us to someone then instead of letting him take over she continued to talk to us.
2) we ordered more shrimp because it was that good and our waiter had no idea we found out that that we ordered it from the owner
3) there was a waitress who gave us a check when we didn&#39;t ask for it. It was like she rushed us it when we were waiting for more food

We will be back. Logistically they need someone who can manage the floor better and understands what each roles are. The food was amazing however if they get busier I could see the lack of execution be a issue.

There was an empty 2 seater table next to us and we asked if we could connect it to spread out a bit. Response &#34;um no sorry because we are very busy today&#34;. So we sat with our elbows bumping into each other until finally..after 30 minutes of no one being seated there, we just used the table without asking. 

Our 6 lbs worth of seafood took about an hour to come out..felt kind of long. The flavors were good, but man, prepare to spend a good chunk of money here. Also, the potatoes they add to your bag of seafood are not cooked all the way. Mine were so hard to bite into! The one and only food item that stood out: the sweet potatoes fries.

They serve the boil in a bag, which has the potential to get very messy, you may want to take advantage of the plastic bibs they provide.  It was delicious!

Not a fan of the fact that they serve the fries well in advance of the boil.  I would have preferred to have them served together.

When they charge by the pound, they should weigh it when they give it to u ....not before they boil it, and lose pieces to the giant appendage eating pot. Our full $40 2lb crab was missing a claw and a leg....and they wouldn&#39;t compensate us more than 5%. After calculating weight and considering the fact that the two missing pieces where a main part of the edible body parts....we were out far more than that--percentage wise. They also just shove the food out in big bags....no plates. Acceptable funky twist perhaps, but not for the prices. Everything is ala carte....so no mixing and matching because the minimum order per item is a pound.....so with three items, you&#39;re looking at a $60 bill pretty quickly....without drinks.

My stuff, however, was fantastic!  I ordered the snow crab with potato and corn.  Holy moly!!!  Everything was delicious and perfectly seasoned.  I will absolutely return to Crab &amp; Spice...possibly tomorrow!  Yum!!!!!

I was really excited to hear there was a cajun crab boil near me opening up and I had fairly high expectations coming in today but I was left disappointed.  I&#39;ve been to cajun crab boils in California like the Boiling Crab and Claws, but I know not to compare them so easily since their seafood is a lot fresher than ours in the Midwest can hope to be.  But I have visited The Angry Crab in West Rogers Park and had such a great experience, comparable to that of the CA crab boils I&#39;ve been to, that I hyped up Crab and Spice so much in my mind thinking it would be the same.

We ordered 2lbs of shrimp in a mix of cajun and garlic butter sauce.  I guess no one else has done this before because our waiter said he check to see if it was possible. We also asked to add sausage, corn and potatoes to it. Then we ordered 1lb of mussels in a mix of garlic butter and Lemon pepper.  

The food came out surprisingly quick.  It may have been because business was slow, but it just seemed too quick. The shrimp meat was pale, as if it were steamed or just boiled in water and not with the sauces.  The flavor of the sauces did not penetrate into the meat at all, like it was precooked in water and tossed around in the sauce briefly before being put in a bag.  I had to dunk it in the sauce in the bag after peeling to get any flavor. The sausage, corn, and potatoes were also treated as side dishes and weren&#39;t mixed in or cooked with the shrimp we ordered it with for some reason.  The mussels were my ultimate disappointment.  They were teeny tiny black mussels, not the big and meaty green mussels I was anticipating.  Also, the white rice we ordered as a side was slightly mushy and my mom said it tasted like it was starting to go bad.

What we ordered was definitely not enough and I was still hungry after eating everything but we were so disappointed that we just decided to leave regardless.  Wr ordered the same amount of food at Angry Crab and we were stuffed to the brim.  Idk what happened here. If you&#39;re not in the area I wouldn&#39;t go out of your way to go here. I would head to Chicago and visit Angry Crab for some good cajun boil even if the wait is 5x longer and the prices 2x higher. If you are in the Woodridge area it wouldn&#39;t hurt to try.  The prices are reasonable for what it is and you may like it the same way some of the other reviewers did.  It just fell flat for me."

It&#39;s not going to be the worlds best seafood but I wasn&#39;t expecting that. I went for inexpensive crab in the Midwest and that&#39;s what I got! It was very good to me. 

They tell you that they boil everything in a big pot and then throw it in a bag with whatever sauce you choose. I got the medium spicy Cajun, it was quite tasty and nicely spicy. 

For the price I enjoyed the seafood, I was quite full at the end and learned how to deal with whole shrimp so that was a interesting experience. I got a few potatoes in the bag but the sides aren&#39;t the focus, the seafood is. 

I will definitely be back and our service was great, I don&#39;t know why people didn&#39;t just flag down a server. The place is very open and the servers congregate at one end where they can see all the tables, I&#39;ve been to several smaller places that do that.

The flavor for the C&amp;S was good but the lemon pepper didn&#39;t taste that great.    Their spicy isn&#39;t that spicy either.  The oysters were pretty fresh but the shrimp size wasn&#39;t as big as the shrimp from Angry Crab.  My favorite is still hot and juicy but this place had no line.

It&#39;s a quaint little place with tables that are modern picnic benches. Minimalistic. No problem. Service was fine. It&#39;s a small place and service is also minimal you order your fish and they bring you your drink and that&#39;s it. We waited a bit for a pound of shrimp. We partners ordered fish and chips. For seven dollars they got fries and two tiny pieces of fried fish. Meh. My shrimp came served in a gallon of the garlic butter. They had an odd taste and for having the shell on them still 13.99 a pound is unreasonable. Not even deveined. Gross. If you like eating shrimp with their pooh vein still in them, then come on by. It was a 33$ dinner and I&#39;d had rather gone to portillo&#39;s."

Likes:

1. No puny shellfish! We got the shellfish sampler and the crab, mussels, and shrimp were meaty and delicious.

2. I read reviews here that said the hot wasn&#39;t hot. I disagree. The Cajun hot seasoning was plenty hot but still allowed us to taste our food. 

3. We also ordered the mussels in garlic butter because we loved the Cajun mussels so much. Full of real garlic! Delicious!

4. Service from start to finish was awesome. Who I assume were the owners were super attentive and great. Loved the (necessary) hand washing station. You will get messy here!

Only dislike:
Beer and wine menu weak. Need more options!"

You pick a seafood, a spice style, and add-ins like corn, potatoes and sausage.  We got the medley with garlic butter and crawfish with the Ultimate with medium spicy.  Dont waste your time with anything else.  Get the Ultimate, which is a mix of their garlic butter, lemon pepper, and cajun spices. This stuff is amazing! I wanted to replace my blood with it.  Had the oysters which were fresh and delicious too.  I think I could eat the oysters and the mussels until they completely ran out of them.

Now the thing to know is this takes a little effort.  Like crab, it takes some effort to peel the shrimp, take apart crawfish etc.  If you don&#39;t know how, don&#39;t worry.  They will send someone to your table to show you how to break down what you&#39;re eating.  I will be back here and I&#39;ll be back a lot!  I plan on coming in with kitchen shears to make my life easy but WOW is this place delicious and fun.

Shrimp, Cajun Medium w corn on the cob and potato was fantastic. My husband tried the shrimp as well as Chicken &amp; Chips, a 2 piece chicken basket with fries and loved those as well.

Now I haven&#39;t been to Angry Crab but I have been to the most popular one of them all, the Boiling Crab in California. We&#39;re talking extremely long lines (1 hour and 45 minute wait) but for delicious food. I got the shrimp, whole sha-bang medium spice. When I came back home, I missed the Boiling Crab so much that I searched for the most comparable restaurant to the Boiling Crab as possible and so we came here. Initially, no wait which was a huge plus. We ordered shrimp, C&amp;S medium spice. And then I wanted crawfish and so I asked if they were live and she said yes and so I ordered them. The food came, the shrimp was delicious but the crawfish were definitely not live, they weren&#39;t even fresh to be honest. The flavor was very similar if not spot on to the Boiling Crab. Their spice levels are not very high. Medium at the Boiling Crab was enough to make me sweat but medium here was like a tickle. If you&#39;re a spice lover, get hot or maybe ask them for something beyond hot because medium was very weak. 
All in all, this is a great place that is both reasonable and comparable to the Boiling Crab. My only tips are to wear gloves if you have cuts and you&#39;re ordering spicy and stay away from the crawfish."

The 3 level hot is mild, it&#39;s not spicy &amp; doesn&#39;t have a kick so don&#39;t go looking for spicy. I agree with other Yelper&#39;s that the food isn&#39;t marinated in the seasonings because it&#39;s actually a little bland. The sausage was nasty. I thru it out. Potatoe was just Ok I hate half of it. I got 2 claws of crablegs which didn&#39;t have alot of meat in them. But I guess it was ok for 14.99. Atleast they weren&#39;t dried out. 1 major negative was I received my rice 10-15mins b4 the rest of my food was brought out 2 me. I asked for a new hot 1 and she was polite and brought anothet warm 1 out. SMH... Compared to Angry Crab, this place needs work!!! They&#39;re very nice and customer service is good, but they are lacking big time in the food department. Not sure if I&#39;d come back.

We tried one with Lemon Pepper and One with all three. Also had the sausage/corn/potatoes with our meal. There is also a bar there too if you wanted to order drinks. Will be returning again :)"

The last time the manager was very courteous and made sure everything was right. Only negative was this a bit ...a tad bit on the pricier side where we cant be regulars and need to wait for a good ocassion..with each person ordering their own dish can run up a good bill. But all in all a great experience and food..just wish I could come here more ( not necessarily  their fault on the price..i understand good seafood comes at a price)

Do not waste your money on the Dungeness crab. It was too expensive for the portion and the meat you get. Empty shells in the bag added to the overall weight and one pound only nets you one half of the crab. Not enough meat for the trouble or price.

As I pass it almost everyday on my way to work I thought I would try it. I have never been to this type of restaurant, my boyfriend has in several cities.

I love seafood and go out to eat it several times a month. We were on our way to Chinn&#39;s 34th Street when we drove past and decided to stop in. That being said, I realized I was going into a different type of dinning experience.

We ordered shrimp, mussels, crab legs, sausage, and corn. We had it prepared in C&amp;S Ultimate at a medium spice level. We attempted to order Lobster Bisque, but were told it was no longer available. Even though, the soup special was written alone on a chalkboard, they saw no need to erase it or take it down after they were out. 

The quality of the seafood was not great, but tasted ok with all the seasoning. This is a very messy meal. The staff was very inattentive. They stood around the cash register the whole time we ate talking. The owner or manager was present, walked around a time or two and spoke with his staff while they were all chatting. I attempted to get our waitresses attention several times to refill our bottom-less drinks. I was only successful in doing this once. Did I mention that the sauce was spicy!

I am not use to such poor service. I get better service at My Burger Joint, where the manager walks around and asks if everything is up to my expectations. The food here was okay, the service was unacceptable, which made me wish we had follow through on our original plan."

I was told that they were not serving fries right now because there was a light bulb that burst over the fryer. I was pretty disappointed but continued with my order. When asked what dipping sauce I wanted, I jokingly said &#34;as much sweet and sour as you can give me.&#34; I get my order and they delivered.

My husband and I went through the drive thru the other night around 10PM. There was only one other car in the line but it took 25 minutes for us to get our food. I was so pissed that I told my husband to just drive away but you can&#39;t even get out of the drive through line! It&#39;s a nightmare. I had thought that maybe the person in front of us had ordered a lot of food. But after waiting forever they were handed only a single cone and they peeled off, as I&#39;m sure they were pissed off about having to wait so long as well. As we proceeded to the window, no one was there to greet us. Finallly after waiting for what felt like an eternity, the manager exited the bathroom then came to the window and said &#34;Do you have your food yet?&#34; Are you kidding!? No I don&#39;t have my food yet otherwise I wouldn&#39;t still be waiting here. She grabbed our food and handed it to us. But forgot our drinks, so again we waited. She could tell we were upset so she apologized, which a manager should do, and told us to have a good night. Even though I was angry, I decided to wait on posting a review until I gave it a try again today.

The employee on the intercom barely spoke a lick of English. She couldn&#39;t understand that I wanted fries with my meal and not apples. She finally got it right and we proceeded to the next window. Again, we were in line forever and for what? Two cars? It wasn&#39;t like this place was poppin&#39;. The guy at the first window gave us our total and stuck his hand out for our money without saying &#34;hi, hello, how are you&#34; anything but &#34;$7.98&#34;. How about a &#34;$7.98 please&#34;? Proceeded to the next window where there were three employees, one of them holding up a bucket of mop water and the other two staring into it, WITH OUR FOOD AND DRINKS RIGHT THERE? I have no idea what they were saying, because they were speaking in Spanish, but one of them poured some of the dirty mop water into one of the McDonald&#39;s cup. My husband and I looked at each other like, &#34;Should we report this?&#34; My husband thinks that it was probably iced tea or something that they were pouring into the drinks but why the hell would they have iced tea in an opened bucket like that? That&#39;s disgusting!

After seeing that I couldn&#39;t even drink my drink. I threw it out. My mighty kids meal was awful. The chicken nuggets were so hard and dried out and my fries were stale. I threw it out too. I am still contemplating calling about the bucket of dirty brown liquid the employees were pouring into drinks. Even as I write about it, it&#39;s really bothering me!

Get it together, McDonald&#39;s."

I went here the other day on my way home with a young African American friend of mine, and it was about 10:00pm or so on a Saturday night so I understand not wanting to be at work but this man who &#34;helped&#34; us, Carl was his name, was being completely rude to my friend. We were talking while ordering and he asked for here or to go? My friend didn&#39;t understand and asked for him to repeat what he had said. He gave her the nastiest look and said with an unnecessary attitude &#34; FOR HERE. OR. TO. GO.&#34; She was all flustered and embarrassed and handed him her money and left to sit down.

I wanted fries, and I wanted a milk shake.  I was right across the street at Fifth Third Bank, and I remembered I had a coupon for a free cookie!

My order was accurate, but when I told the speaker about the coupon, the cookie was charged to my total anyway.  So I told the girl at the window, who held her hand out for my money, and she deferred to another employee.  Then I got the right total.  Then the woman swore at the other employee in Spanish.

My food was hot.  That&#39;s all I could really ask for.  My expectations of McDonald&#39;s, despite their remodeling and attempt to rebrand with McCafe drinks, are exceedingly low.

The cookie had a weird after taste, as if they were cooked on a pan that was used for something else."

The second sandwich came back with everything on it AGAIN. Finally the manager went back and made the sandwich himself... Probably without washing his hands.

This time was no different. When I got to the window, though, I tried it and it tasted like there was extra sugar. The drive through attendant noticed that I was displeased, leaned out the window and asked what was wrong. I let her know, and without missing a beat, she smiled and held out her hand and offered to remake it. Did not seem at all inconvenienced or annoyed at having to do this. They had me pull forward to the &#34;reserved&#34; drive thru spot, and very quickly brought out my new (and PERFECTLY made!) iced coffee.

Yes, BUT in my defense, it was late at night, very dark and cold out, I had enjoyed a few brews, and the Mexican food place I had intended on getting delicious veggie tacos from had closed early that night. I was in a dire munchie situation and this was literally my only choice.

Lucky for me, the place was a ghost town so I figured that at the very least, I could get my large fry order quickly as I my empty belly felt quite the sense of urgency. 

So, I order my fries... which was quite the little task because knowing where the drive through speaker lives vs. what&#39;s just a large add that looks like a speaker but is not actually meant to be spoken into, was not intuitive for me. Basically, it involved me going forward and reversing, over and over, yelling hello, and feeling like an idiot. Once I finally figured out where to order and successfully completed that task, I pulled around to the window, paid, and sat there. Then I sat there some more, longer, little longer, and then finally I realize that there&#39;s another window father up where I need to go to pick up my food. I now realize that most people know to pull up to the second window, but as a person who hasn&#39;t used a non-coffee drive through in years, it would have been nice for the the cashier girl to lemme in on the drive through process before I sat there like an idiot for 5 minutes while she just stared at me through her window. Once I did pull up to the second window I again waited, and waited, and waited, and waited until there was now a line of 3 cars behind me and I know exactly what they were thinking because I used to think the same thing when I went to drive throughs and the car in front of me took forever. It was the &#34;what the f*ck did that fatty order?&#34; thought.  Knowing people where thinking that about me made me super self conscious and I seriously wanted to roll the window down more and explain to the waiting cars behind me that I&#39;m sorry, but I just got one order of fries and I didn&#39;t know what was taking so long, but it wasn&#39;t my fault. I ended up waiting an additional 12 minutes on top of the 5 I had already spent  sitting by the cashier window. I would have thought that Mickey D&#39;s could have a batch of fries out in a snap, but apparently not... or at least not at Midnight, when you really need it.

After my stressful wait time, I pulled away trying to see the up side- that my fries must be the freshest damn fries that anyone has ever received. Not s&#39;much. The box wasn&#39;t even that full and the fries lacked any flavor besides oil.  That&#39;ll teach me. 

All in all, it took 20 minutes for my one thing of fries, when I was initially the only person here. In that time, I could have been home and already falling asleep with a hot pocket in my mouth. Never again, lesson learned."

The manager comes to the window, and ask if there is a problem.  I told him I didn&#39;t get my 2nd sandwich, and he tells me that I didn&#39;t order it, and that I owed him $1.40.  I paid him the money, and told him that I did order it, he says , &#34;That&#39;s why we confirm the orders, and I didn&#39;t order it.  When he gave me my sandwich, I told him that&#39;s not any way to treat customers. He started to say things to antagonize me. He even stuck his head out the window, to yell at my car. I put my car in park, and went up to the window, and told him that was unacceptable, and that he was ignorant. He yelled at me to get away from his window, and slammed the windows in my face.  I went into the store to ask for the manager, and he said, &#34;I&#39;m it.&#34;  I asked for his name and the 800#, and he told me it was on the bag.

He called the police, and they came.  They asked questions, I gave my food back and went back to the store the next morning, and the manager gave me my money back, she apologized and told me how to contact corporate.  She also said she would pass the info on, which she did t.  I went back to talk to the GM on Monday, and he listened and said he would talk to him.  WOW, that&#39;s all you got?!?!?!?

Inside, it is usually chaos during a busy time. After you order, there is nowhere to stand. You are mixed in with folks who are waiting to place their orders and it get pretty crazy.

One might get great service one time and a real screw up the very next.  Much of the lowly front end help look foreign  born or have minimal education.  As others have commented, sometimes there will be more people milling around BEHIND the counter than customers in front.  You would think that all McDonalds locations would have their act together by now.  I don&#39;t think that customers expect The Ritz, but get the order right the first time, in a reasonably speedy fashion.

Today was the final straw... went through the drive -thru for a quick dinner  on the go and the messed up 3 of the 5 meals I ordered. I pulled the car around the building and went in to fix it... They fixed it and took $1.00 off that they shouldn&#39;t of charged me in the first place. Customer service is not their priority. I left there more irritated at the fact they were unapologetic and made no true peace offering so to speak.

I went through the drive-thru to order my dinner, a McDouble and a Bacon McDouble burger; I clearly was on a health kick tonight!  I wasn&#39;t paying attention to the order screen at all because when I got my burgers and my receipt, I realized that the person taking the order had entered a Bacon Cheddar McChicken.  For most people, it probably wouldn&#39;t matter, but I hate mayo with all my being and could not eat the chicken sandwich.  I was still in the parking lot when I noticed the mistake, so I drove back up to the drive-thru window and explained my problem to the girl at the 1st window.  She said she would fix my order and swap the Chicken for the correct burger; she was very nice and apologized.  What more could I really ask for?  About a minute later I had my corrected order and I drove off again.  

I didn&#39;t open my McDonald&#39;s bag until I got home and was surprised to see a free Apple Pie in my bag.  Not necessary, I was happy that my burger order got fixed, but this is how you create a Raving Fan!  They corrected my order quickly, were nice about it, and gave me something above and beyond.  I&#39;m glad this is the McDonald&#39;s that is closest to my house and will continue to happily drive-thru in the future.

Thanks for turning around a mistake and making it great!"

It&#39;s like a bright, brilliant beacon from above. It is a clean, new, well-oiled, efficient McDonald&#39;s. I might sound dramatic here, but there is another McDonald&#39;s near our house that we used to always have to go to because it was the closest. It sucked immensely. We could never get our order quickly and something was always messed up. Seriously. Always. 

But they built this place within walking distance (we still drive because we are lazy and it&#39;s winter, duh), but we couldn&#39;t be happier with this location. They have freakin&#39; digital menus...I mean c&#39;mon, is this the space age? How neat is that?! The place is always clean...literally every time my husband and I have zipped by there (dine in or drive thru), there is ALWAYS someone sweeping the parking lot. I love that. There&#39;s always been someone cleaning/maintaining the beverage area too. The place is going to look pristine for awhile, with people like this. The food is always fresh and they get it to you quickly. What more can you ask for? 

Some McDonald&#39;s out there have probably been around for awhile and they know people are going to keep coming back, regardless of the service. But if this place keeps it up, I will be a one-McDonald&#39;s-only customer. I&#39;ve been burned too badly by the other location on Diehl Road in Warrenville to ever go back there...this place rules, ya&#39;ll."

The manager seems to go through quite a few employees. There are many that are new, and many that turn over. What I&#39;ve seen is that the manager keeps the best, and there are great ones like Jasmine in the morning, but terminates the bad ones. 

I think people need to have a little patience with this manager trying to rebuild after corporate bought out the previous owner (Yoshi and Karen ran the show better than anyone else.)

Anyway, I know the new management team is trying. Let&#39;s give them a break for awhile. They&#39;ll find some great stable employees soon. I think the manager is doing well. However, do get rid of the ones that don&#39;t smile or don&#39;t say thanks.

I used to work at a McDonald&#39;s, so I know how frustrating learning can be when you first train - that&#39;s all that&#39;s happening here - the manager is keeping the best, but turning over the worst, and many are just in training mode and making mistakes. A smile will win everyone&#39;s heart. Please tell your employees that it&#39;s okay to make a mistake when you&#39;re new, but a sorry for the wait, a smile, and a thank you go a super long way with me.

I know what you&#39;re doing takes time; keep up the good work, for I do see progress with time. Also, perhaps give the best ones (they&#39;re obvious) a raise to keep them.

Good luck!"

I agree with the other reviewer that the only option to fix it is to fire EVERY SINGLE PERSON ASSOCIATED or close the thing and forget it altogether. They never get orders correct and you have to stop to check before pulling away otherwise 9/10 chance it&#39;ll be wrong. They can&#39;t even handle putting the correct number of burgers in the bag. I can&#39;t even count how many times I&#39;ve gotten home and had things missing. And these are the people that want $15/hr yet can&#39;t do a job requiring zero skill or even common sense for that matter. I don&#39;t even bother with this McDonald&#39;s anymore. And you can&#39;t even chalk it up to the company in general because I&#39;ve been to so many and never had such horrendous experiences. This location completely defies the meaning of fast food (15 min wait in Drive thru or inside if you&#39;re LUCKY even when not busy) and then don&#39;t count on the food being right. Absolutely hopeless. Maybe the management should start taking a look at Yelp. I get that it&#39;s not a glamorous job but how difficult is it to put a burger in a bag and pass it through a window?

I never go to McDonalds since I&#39;m a vegan, but I am also a nanny. The  kids think it is a treat when they get to go, but on this particular day, it was no treat for anyone. The line was the usual lunch time rush line with a mix of kids, grandparents, and labors. There&#39;s no organization at all. All the cashiers look out at you with a blank stare while everyone else figures out who&#39;s next in line. I have never been able to bring the kids here without having to go back up at least 2 or 3 times because of things being wrong. Plain, no pickles, ketchup only, apparently these are terms not understood here.

On this day, I had to go back up to many times to count. First let me start out by saying they were out of little boys toys for the happy meals. I was not told this until I went back up to say we didn&#39;t receive a toy. Then the cheeseburger had pickles, onions, and mustard on it when I asked for it ketchup only. I asked for it with fries and it came with apples and yogurt. Oh, I also asked for chocolate milk, and got a medium root beer. Good grief! That was just the first meal. I ordered a Southwest salad no chicken. The first time I got the bacon ranch chicken salad (with chicken), and the second time I got the southwest salad still with chicken. Three times a charm with the salad. My next issues takes the cake. I ordered the #15 (10 PC chicken nugget meal) with a small root beer.  We got the #16 (fillet of fish) meal with a large sprite. Some of these mistakes don&#39;t even make sense! The last child&#39;s meal only had. messed up drink. She ordered a big Mac and a small root beer. Instead of the small, she got a medium. She wasn&#39;t complaining. 4 meals, all screwed up.

The final straw for me was how dirty the restaurant  was. We had to get napkins to wipe a table off to sit at. Paper on the floor and the trash is overflowing, but 11 people behind the counter standing around. That didn&#39;t include everyone in the back that was actually &#34;cooking&#34;.

This McDonalds is so close, but I think we I&#39;ll have to find a new one to go to this summer. I will go absolutely crazy this if I have to deal with this every time."

The first time they messed up was when I was in a hurry so I went through the drive-thru to order an iced tea. I specifically said &#34;regular iced tea&#34; because I know they have sweet tea, and that stuff is like drinking sugar water blech. Welp whadya know, they gave me sweet tea. So I parked my car and went inside to get my regular tea. When I explained to the manager at the register what happened, he asked the guy at the drive-thru window about it, and he swore up and down with the biggest attitude that I ordered sweet tea. On top of that all the other employees were giggling and snickering under their breath at us. What the heck? 

The second incident happened when I went through the drive-thru and ordered some fries. I sat at the drive-thru window forever, and could see 2 different girls inside, both texting on their cell phones...I wonder why the food took so long. -_- As I was on my home I reached into the bag to eat some fries, and they were pretty much room temperature or even colder. They were also old, dark, and hard. I immediately call the store when I got home to let them know about both the slow service because of these texting employees, and also about the inedible fries (I threw them all away). She apologized and said she would talk to the girls, and apologized about the fries. I&#39;m guessing this location is a franchise because it doesn&#39;t seem to be ran very well.

I also contacted the district manager about this, and when we spoke he was very apologetic as well. My qualm with all of this is that I was never reimbursed for my wasted money. A few bucks isn&#39;t very much, but I basically threw that money away because of their crappy service. I thought that the district manager would try to compensate me in some way, but nope. 

At least this gives me a reason to not eat at McDonald&#39;s anymore, I don&#39;t need all those extra calories and sodium anyway. ;)"

Sandwich was tough and bland - it was a roast beef sandwich that was supposed to include mustard and horseradish, and I&#39;m not confident it included either one. Also, a fruit skewer on a roast beef sandwich? Little odd. Came with chips, which turned out to be stale corn chips. 

As other have mentioned, service was hit and miss. Long wait with only a few people ahead of me. Their method of adding people to their loyalty program includes manually providing information including birthdate to the cashier, and no loyalty card. I would definitely suggest allowing customers to fill out this information on a sheet of paper, it would speed up the line and be a little more private. As it is, I felt awkward running through everything with multiple people waiting impatiently behind me. 

The cashier was helpful and very kind, while the server who brought out the drinks was clipped and rude to everyone but her friend who stopped by, who she greeted effusively. Nice. They also don&#39;t have anyone dedicated to getting loose leaf for customers - you just have to wait in line again with everyone else if you&#39;d like some tea to take home. Not confident I&#39;ll be coming back with better tea stores not far away.

It&#39;s a great spot to post up with your lap top, get some work done, and enjoy a beverage. Or hell, it&#39;s also the perfect spot to meet with colleagues, clients, or a whole slew of people because this place is huge! Their website is accurate in saying &#34;Cafe K&#39;Tizo is the perfect place to connect.&#34; 

They have an upstairs and a downstairs with plenty of tables and some comfy chairs. Free wifi of course, which is a must. The food menu is slim, but it gets the job done - plenty of pastries, a few breakfast items, salads, and paninis. Tea is really the hot spot here, but I also enjoy that they have coffee and smoothies as well.

I&#39;ve been here twice now (with plans to come back) and both times I got the cappuccino to drink which was very good (with whole milk FYI). If you plan on sticking around, it comes served in a nice coffee mug complete with latte art on top. The only item I&#39;ve eaten here so far is their breakfast bagel, and it&#39;s really good! I highly suggest this. The bagel is the perfect size and softness, with egg, Canadian bacon, and cheese. I was worried this would be a carb overload and hard to eat, but the bagel was just great.

It&#39;s also to be noted that they have tons and tons of tea for sale! I can&#39;t wait to dive into their tea beverages and loose leaf next time I&#39;m in. My only complaint (which is why I couldn&#39;t give a full 5 stars), is that both times I&#39;ve had to wait around at the counter for someone to show up to take my order. I&#39;m guessing they have a lot going on in the back, but my suggestion would be to always have someone up front manning the register so your patrons don&#39;t have to wait for help. Thanks :)"

There weren&#39;t many options around me, so I opted to try something new hoping it might become a new stop. I gotta say, how in the world does this place have such high ratings?! My experience was worse than horrid!

When I arrived there were no employees to be found. There were just a couple of customers at random tables. I had to wait several minutes for someone to come from the back. When he finally showed up he was eating... I had to wait a few more minutes for him to greet me cuz he had to finish eating... A couple more employees slowly appeared from the back room while he was assisting me with full mouths and cups in their hands like nothing important was going on...

My order was super simple, but for some reason was over $9... I paid for it anyway and waited to see what would be so special about a latte and some yogurt. While I waited the employees were rather negative in their conversation amongst each other. It didn&#39;t appear that they enjoyed working for the company and they would much rather be somewhere else.

I received my ordered and went on my way... The latte didn&#39;t have much in the way of flavor. I&#39;m not sure what they use for their espresso, but it wasn&#39;t very grand as the name would suggest a latte should be! I think they may have forgotten to add the flavor shot altogether while the complaining was happening. I guess my extra $ .50 for it didn&#39;t mean much. 

The yogurt was a huge joke! It was at least a day past its due date! And mixed berries?! They were frozen berries that were barely thawed. The ones that had thawed were mushy and watery. This was the most disgusting yogurt parfait I&#39;ve ever had! I had 2 bites of it before throwing it out! I can go to a fast food place and get a yogurt parfait with fresh berries for half that price! And the yogurt won&#39;t be spoiled!

Latte sugar free hazelnut skim milk 16 oz $4.50
Low Fat Greek Yogurt plain, with granola &amp; mixed berries $4.25
 
I definitely will NOT be back! I also won&#39;t be suggesting that anyone else try this place out either!"

The cafe itself is spacious with two seating areas, the main floor and additional tables up a staircase.  Friday nights offer live music, which adds to the relaxed and comfortable feeling.  The employees are friendly too, occasionally offering samples during the evening.  The coconut matcha was really good.

The drink menu has every variation you can think of.  Coffee, lattes, matcha, iced teas, you name it.  I went with something called the &#34;Himalayan Happiness,&#34; an iced latte with black tea, peach, and almond.  It was very good, and after the sample of coconut matcha, I would not hesitate to try more beverages from the menu.  Drinks are around $4 each, but they do have multiple sizes.

The food menu is simple:  sandwiches, soups, wraps, and salads.  The Stonehenge panini, with roast beef, cheddar, mustard, and horseradish was out of this world.  If you like horseradish, you will love this panini!  Sandwiches are served with chips or veggies, but the portion of chips was really quite small.  For $8, it was a little expensive for the portion.

Cafe T&#39;Kizo is a cozy spot for studying, working, or hanging out on a chill Friday night.  I really hope they&#39;re here to stay.  The shopping center where they&#39;re located is mostly empty, I didn&#39;t even know T&#39;Kizo existed until I saw reviews in my Yelp feed, so if you live in the Carol Stream and Wheaton area and think you&#39;ve been everywhere and are sick of all the usual options, you need to check this place out."

I ordered a sandwich that came with a side of carrots. I thought  $8 was a little high. I also ordered a fizzy iced tea that I thought was different. My friend ordered the pumpkin spice latte and she liked it. She also let me try some of her coconut cake which was ok, nothing spectacular.

The decor is pretty nice and modern.  There are a decent number of seats, downstairs, upstairs, and outside.  Some good options for gluten free eating.  I had the Stonehenge GF wrap, which was basically roast beef, cheddar, and horseradish.  YUM.  My wife had a salad.  I can&#39;t remember which one, but it was flavorful.

The smoothie was good.  My daughter loved it.  They have a variety of teas and espresso drinks.  A bunch of games are available as well.  There is definitely a nice coffee shop vibe.  They have added a changing table to the women&#39;s bathroom.

Some of the workers seem very shy and quiet.  It&#39;s hard to hear them over the ambient sounds of the shop.  This makes ordering a bit of a chore.  They were nice though."

It makes me want to meet girlfriends or have a bookclub meeting here. Very inviting and warm. I am a new tea drinker and found this on yelp after recently moving to the area. The food and beverages all look amazing. I will say that I have been here 2x. The first time I literally walked in, looked around, and left. The wall of Tea is impressive but where to start?? Also, food is served but no explanation of the what the menu items are at first glance. You can grab a paper menu to get the ingredients, how do I order the Hanging a Garden of Babylon without having an idea of what delights might await me?? The tea appears to sold by the cup or pre-packaged. I asked about some tea and was directed to displays. The service was nice, but it wasn&#39;t freshly packed for you like teavana does. I bought 4 oz of herbal teas for about $12-$14. 
I will give this place a try for some brewed beverage options and a snack. I do recommend stopping in-it&#39;s a nice compliment to The Daily Method in the same plaza. (Calling it a strip mall is demeaning for how nice this little area is)"

Nice and modern cafe with couches to lounge on, plenty of tables with lots of seating and the have a loft area or &#34;the mezz&#34; (mezzanine) as they call it. The cafe is beautiful and had a great clean and airy feel to it. There is music playing in the background, there is aren&#39;t on the walls, they have a Great Wall of hope. They have a wall of tea and have tea to buy and make at home. In the upstairs mezz area there is more seating, there are books to read and games to play. I was impressed with the looks of the cafe and my blended tea latte made me love this place even more! I ordered the Himalayan Happiness blended tea latte, a recommendation from employee Leah. It is was so delicious! 
This place is only a 5 minute drive from my house, I know that I will become a regular. They serve breakfast items like scones, bagels, oatmeal and quiche. They also serve salads and wraps. This is a local business, great tea shop, very cute and inviting. Great job Cafe K&#39;Tizo!"

For my son who eats wheat free, this place is a dream. Pastry and lunch options abound for everyone, with plenty of healthy choices. Interesting soups, too. I tried the chicken and rice and did not love it (a little too salty for me), but everything else we had was outstanding, including the roast beef panini and tropical smoothie (the tropical smoothie will have us coming back again and again, and best of all, it contains squash) Yum! I&#39;ve also had an iced chai and a pi√±a colada tea, and both were very satisfying.

The employee who helped us on our first visit (Justin) was very knowledgeable, made some great recommendations, and made us feel very welcome. I think the owner has been there a couple times, as well. What a neat shop!

There is artwork displayed from the local community, which is always a plus, and a connection to the school district, I think. There are games, including mancala available for some tea shop fun.

Even though it was a busy, rainy Saturday, and I was the only one who showed for the class - she was willing to still host me and I&#39;m so glad she did. I learned a wealth of information about the growing, harvesting, preparing and brewing techniques for black, oolong, green and white (amongst others), got to taste some delicious fresh-brewed samples, and was given just the right amount of inspiration to want to learn more.

Eventually I was able to try Cafe K&#39;Tizo. Then I thought it was so good, I came back again.

The first tea I had was a blended matcha tea with coconut syrup and soy milk. The coconut syrup was their recommendation, and it goes very well with matcha tea. 

It&#39;s hard to describe what matcha tea tastes like, other than to say: unlike the ones I&#39;ve had before, this one was quite strong, but still pleasant. 

We came back for breakfast. I tried the old-fashioned oatmeal, which was also good and far exceeded the usual berries-to-oatmeal ratio. We also had a scone. 

The baked goods were quite good, but this time I had a blended chai tea, while my wife had a herbal blend of some sort. Summer berry, I think?

The chai was super spicy; as in the right amount of cloves and cinnamon flavors. And the herbal tea was very fruity and pleasant. 

I hadn&#39;t had K&#39;Tizo tea prior to coming here twice, but more than any other tea store I&#39;ve visited, I started to understand the value of well-steeped tea. Maybe well enough to turn it into another habit!"

I have tried all kinds of their teas from green, to herbal, to black and I have loved them all. I also have one of their pitchers specifically designed for making tea and it&#39;s awesome. It makes brewing a large quantity of tea so easy. 

I was just in the store and it&#39;s so nice! The store is decorated really beautifully. There is an upstairs decorated with art and seemed like the perfect place to curl up with a book. 

One of the things I liked the most about the store is that you can choose from about 40 flavors of tea and they will make a 2 oz, 4 oz, or larger bag. This really allowed me to customize my order and get exactly what I wanted. They also gave me a coupon for a free tea next time I came in with a friend!

You get a pretty spiffy set up with your pot and a timer to keep the overly anxious from taking out the tea too soon. It&#39;s pretty cool.

The place is big, with a loft area and a lower seating area. Games, larger and smaller tables and plenty of comfy chairs.  They have a food menu that looks pretty good, including some fairly cheap options (bagel for a $1 and cup of soup for $3) and then salads and wraps for the $7-9 range. I haven&#39;t eaten here so can&#39;t give you a read on that, but I&#39;m a fan of this place. I hope Wheaton/Carol Stream will support it.

For food: Their coconut cake is absolutely AMAZING! :)  Definitely recommend that. Also, their Machu Picchu black bean soup was really good. Hubby had the Stonewall panini with chips and felt like it was a pretty small portion. The price couldn&#39;t be beat though!

The atmosphere is fun, calm and relaxing. The board games to play make for a pretty fun date night. 

All in all I love this place!"

Their location is a bit hard to see/notice and I drive past it everyday to go to work. The owners are nice but the last time I was there waiting for my tea another customer came up to tell them that her food wasn&#39;t cooked all the way through. They apologized and told her that they appreciated her telling them but they didn&#39;t offer her a replacement or a choice for another snack on the house. This seemed very odd to me and basic customer service. The space is much too big for a tea house. I hope they succeed but it may be a long shot.

Solid coffee and espresso selections, with outstanding loose leaf tea selections.  Their loft is a great place to &#34;park it&#34; for a few hours to get a little work done or hide away with a book.  

The barista offered to make me a latte similar to one of the Starbucks offering - very well executed.  Think I&#39;ll experiment next time with one of their tea options - but whether you have a taste for coffee/espresso or tea, it looks like Wheaton has a new alternative to the chains.

I am now getting vibes that the food here is just plain old mediocre. My first meal was a Reuben sandwich, and it was excellent. When I ordered it again I was unimpressed though. I tried a burger most recently, and didn&#39;t really care for it. The fries aren&#39;t anything special. The soup that comes with the sandwiches could be better as well. Nothing was really bad, but it wasn&#39;t good either.

Maybe I should have stuck to their breakfast items. That is what my wife got all three times, and she enjoyed her meals. 

One thing I will say though is that their meals are reasonably priced. That is probably the main reason that we have gone back. They just need to make better lunch entrees!"

The waiter brought out some fresh hot hash browns which I cant understand how a restaurant doesnt serve it like this in the first place...
It makes me wonder if any if any of these people who leaves these positive  reviews has any idea what good hot fresh breakfast suppose to taste like...hmmmm
No sense at all.
When I first arrived and opened up the menu, I was shocked to see a price for 1 egg at $4.59 
I had to grab my glasses just to verify this price...I told the waiter in spanish that this is normally the hint of what kind of management rubs this type of restaurant and its food pricing...is the menu.

For a morning breakfast the restaurant was slow...had about 4 customers. Which is another hint.

The waiter was right on..he was great...very responsive and he took responsibility of the hash browns which wasnt his fault....no manager ever walked up to me to express apologies. ..another hint how this restaurant is managed...I hear alot of gossip outside the kitchen area but not to customers who are there (only 4) which means dont they dont give a damn about why I had my hash browns cold...

If it wasnt for that good omelette and Roger being nice..I would of given 2 stars."

It looks like nothing special from the outside, so I have for years passed it up thinking it was probably like a family-owned Dennys.  Now that I have tried this place a couple of times, it will be my &#34;go-to&#34; for breakfast and lunch.  

First of all, I have to give a shout-out to the awesome waitress there.  I am horrible for not getting her name the couple of times that I have been there, but honestly I might come here just to see her.  She is super energetic and friendly and really makes dining there a great experience.  She will tell you what is good, tells you when you should choose something else and just overall super attentive.  

The food is great.  I have had a french dip sandwich, soups, patty melts - everything has been great.  My favorite waitress told me once that the restaurant insists on using fresh oil to fry their fried items in each day.  You can really tell in the taste of their food.  They have amazing onion rings - some of the best I have ever had but even the fries are exceptional.  I always end up eating my fries first and then bringing home 1/2 of my main entree because I am full.  

Overall, a great place for breakfast or lunch.  I will be back again and again."

One weekend morning not too long ago I was driving down Ogden avenue, and was quite hungry and decided to give this place a try. In stepping in I noticed it looked like many other breakfast places in the area. I was very quickly greeted and then seated and soon was handed a menu.

After looking over my options and noticing many familiar breakfast dishes on the menu such as Hobo and Gypsy skillets which are commonly served in pancake houses throughout the area. I finally narrowed down my choice to a spicy chicken skillet. I placed my order and fairly shortly thereafter my food was at the table. The spicy chicken skillet had spicy chicken on it, mushrooms, pepper, onions and hollandaise sauce. While hollandaise and chicken might sound like a strange pairing it went together quite well. I had the skillet with scrambled eggs which were soft and fluffy. Overall I was very happy with my food.

The service here was excellent, my server was attentive and friendly going so far as to give me a soda &#34;to go&#34; at the end of my meal. Overall I was very pleased with my breakfast at Morningside and would recommend visiting. I&#39;ll give them four stars, good food, good service at a fair price."

However, the hash browns were a bit under done. As you can see from the picture it didn&#39;t have that crispy golden brown crust you expect. The ham was thick, but it seemed to be steamed. There was no caramelization on it at all. It could have been put on the flat top for a minute just to give it some color. The bacon was thick as advertized and not the paper thin stuff you get at other places. The staff was very friendly. I would eat here again.

Food was okay, pancakes- take like bisquick and they were burnt. French toast - nothing too exciting. Everything must have been cooked in butter because my over-easy eggs were yellow -_-
&#34;warm maple&#34; syrup was not really maple syrup because there should have been a solid layer on top of it was it cooled.

Coffee... was ugh, they said it was Kona coffee, until I called them out on it and the girls at front change their statement and said &#34; oh well, it&#39;s only a mix of Kona about 45%&#34;.... oh boy

The menu is easy to follow and they give some generous side additions (french toast for no extra charge?!). Although they don&#39;t include bacon in many dishes I think this may be because they have higher quality bacon (we didn&#39;t get the chance to try it).

I love to stop in for breakfast before work. The owners and wait staff are great. I always get the veggie omelette or the skillet. My only complaint is the hash browns are not consistent. Sometimes it seems like they were cooked and left on the grill to long. Felt like I was gnawing on warm potato flavored straws. Then some days they would be great. Hash browns make the skillet. It doesn&#39;t matter what you put on top if the hash browns suck. I&#39;m just saying. Maybe I should start off by asking for a sample before I place my order. Or I could just start getting fruit. But I digress. Great spot just ask about the hash browns first. Or maybe who&#39;s cooking them that day.

I&#39;m sure they&#39;re not prefect at something, but give it at least 2 tries.  It&#39;s a quiet little diner with a large menu, and though I haven&#39;t tried everything the skillets are big enough to feed a sumo wrestler coming off of a heavy workout, which is to say I always try to finish them because they are so good, but I just can&#39;t.

My waitress was Angel ... Very sweet and attentive and kept the iced tea refills coming!  As a person born in the south I judge EVERYONE based on their iced tea - this place was very good and brewed, clear and fresh! And no, we don&#39;t ONLY drink sweet tea!

Had the Denver Croissant and subbed fries for hash browns - no charge - fries were hot and crispy, breakfast sandwich delicious.

Table next to me got Nutella and banana crepes which looked amazing!

PLUS free WiFi!

I&#39;ll be back!"

Its your standard breakfast place so you can get what you&#39;d expect from those types of places.. Skillets, omelets, pancakes, steak and eggs, the usual menu.  The prices are a little high, not too bad though.  What I like best about the place is the service.  I went in on Sunday morning around 9 and there were a lot of people but no wait.  I sat in Cathy&#39;s section and she was awesome.  The water was always full, she was way ahead of everything, offered to give us to go cups for our coffee and brought some extra syrup in a cup for the pancakes we were bringing home and we didn&#39;t even ask, she was just on top of everything!  On top of all that, she was friendly!  Sometimes waiters and waitresses can be over intrusive with asking if everything is good, but she was just right.  It&#39;s the little things that matter. I told my girlfriend that I thought the service was so great that I had to yelp it.

What we got tasted like Campbell&#39;s chicken noodle soup and was basically it was a few noodles and broth. He ordered a chicken sandwich, which arrived dried out on a bun two sizes too small and a bowl of hollandaise sauce which tasted just like mayo. I ordered the gyros wrap and that&#39;s what I got... a wrap on a huge plate with a pickle. The pickle juice soaked the tortilla, but other than a soggy wrap it tasted fine.  The server was quick, but barely spoke to us - at least the coffee and orange juice were good.  Not worth the $22 + tip."

Location is FABULOUS and the restaurant has a nice ambiance.  The staff was very courteous, from the person that made our reservation to matre&#39;D&#39; to the cleanup guys. As it was a buffet, no waiter(ess) were involved. 

Commendable dish was the nehari. It was just perfect.

My family went for their Iftar Buffet. The nanan was fresh,  but the rest of the food was okay.  With this being Ramadan, they should have put a  pitcher of ice cold water at each table. So many paper cups were wasted going to get water, juice, etc.  

When I made reservations, I was told kids under 5 eat free. When we went to pay the bill, they tried to charge me for the kids. When I reminded them what was said on the phone they backed down and did not charge me."

We had to wait for some time before our food was served so I would have appreciated tawa roasted pappad( hint hint Sara&#39;s grill) we ordered brain masala which was gamey but u know brain kinda gamey hence it was edible and prepared nicely. Sahi paneer brought the taste of mum&#39;s cooking loved it. Their naan was round not the regular shape soft and buttred to perfection. We ordered goat biryani but I didn&#39;t get the chance to try it yet and I am hoping it doesn&#39;t have aloo in it.

To name a few, chicken mahkni, samosas, aloo masala, garlic naan, and chai tea. The chicken mahkni is by far the best I&#39;ve ever had, it&#39;s so buttery and creamy, it&#39;s so velvety smooth and so rich with flavor. Their naan, is so fluffy and crispy at the same time. With those in one mouthful, is a perfect combination. Their samosas, are jammed pack with goodness! Just enough for an appetizer, put some sauce on their and you&#39;ll be loving every moment.

We had ordered chicken tikka, murgh handi, dal makhani, naan and chicken biryani.

Taste -- 4/5 -- Surprised to have such authentic taste of desi food...specially chicken tikka with bone or so called tandoori chicken was fabulous.....i would recommend that to everyone

 Curry and roti/bread were delicious too

To get food like this outside of the city/Devon is simply a blessing! I&#39;ve had their Iftar buffet, and their suhoor buffet, during Ramadan and both were chock full of delicious options. Outside of Ramadan, I ordered food for takeaway today from their regular menu. 

I ordered their Grill Platter #1, which included lamb chops, grilled fish, skewers of chicken shashlik, and Bihari kababs. Now, usually when I order a mixed platter, I only expect 1/2 or 2/3 of the platter to be good - not all components are usually good. So imagine my surprise when each of the aforementioned components was cooked to perfection! I especially loved the chops, the shashlik and the fish. In addition to the platter, I ordered the Karahi Gosht (mutton/lamb), and it was absolutely delicious - the curry was nice and rich, and just the right blend of spices without being overtly spicy or heavy. There was plenty of meat in the curry, and all of it was tender and scrumptious! The naan was warm and soft, and packaged well for the takeout, I imagine it tastes even better in house (it did when I went for the buffet). Lastly, the imli chutney was good, but perhaps needs to be slightly less sweet. The mint-cilantro yogurt chutney was just pure perfection. They also packed a salad and some white rice, which I was not expecting so again I was pleasantly surprised.

Overall, Sara&#39;s food has yet to disappoint me. Far from disappointing, their food is always satisfying and excellent, and their portions are pretty good. Also, their management is really sweet and quite accommodating. I would most certainly recommend this desi place to anyone who is looking for good Pakistani/Indian food in the Aurora/Naperville area."

I had the Chicken Makhti which was very good.  I tend to be a bit of a &#34;wuss&#34; when it comes to hot/spicy food but this had just enough &#34;kick&#34; to make it tasty but not too spicy.  My wife had the Curry Shrimp and liked it as well and when she commented to Saj that she actually would like it a little hotter/spicier he took it back to the kitchen and made it spicier - which she loved!

It hit the palate with an almost sweet taste- ending up with the right amount of heat. 
All at very reasonable prices"

Ambience is nice. Good location.
Decently priced.
Wait staff are friendly and hospitable unlike majority of desi restaurants I&#39;ve been in the Chicago area. 

Onto the food. Disclaimer: I&#39;m first gen Indian and don&#39;t really eat as spicy as my friends/family. But even *I* found the food lacking in heat, flavor and spice. There was just no oomph. This is great for sensitive stomachs or those looking for an intro to indo-pak cuisine. 

We had grill platter, some chops, nehari and a variety of naans. The kheer was pretty good. 

I was thinking of rating it three stars but I tacked on a star because everyone&#39;s heat/spice preferences vary."

The second is service and value. This is where this place fails to meet expectations. The service is painfully slow. Both times I&#39;ve been there (lunch and dinner), they&#39;ve only had one person working the entire front part of the restaurant. The lunch buffet is laughable with only 3/4 good dishes. And they don&#39;t always honor specials listed on their website! All this being said, I hope they can turn this place around because it has potential."

Food/Service
They use fresh ingredients and that&#39;s important for indian/pakistani foods. Haven&#39;t try the buffet yet, can&#39;t comment on that. They have (fluent) English speaking waiters...yay...also, the restaurant is clean and bright inside...

We ordered samosas, chicken makhni, shahi paneer, and an order of naan. The samosas were heavenly and one order of naan was enough for us to share. The entrees were both delicious and definitely hit the spot. The portions were just right for both of us to be sliiiightly over comfortably full but not stuffed or unhappy by any means. Rice was not given as a side, but our waiter brought us a bowl when we asked. The manager also came by after the meal with two small bowls of dessert samples for us. Yum!

I was a little disappointed that there were no weekday lunch specials when we went. The manager said that they would be adding those soon, but I haven&#39;t been back to see those.

First of all we were the only 2 having a lunch in that place. Secondly, the waiter says he has no flexibility in order. The food was stale. The biryani was from the previous days. Sorry guys, delaying our order by 20 minutes does not give a impression that the food is made fresh. Why did they take 20 minutes to microwave the previous days food?

The chicken side was so stale that I developed a bad stomach. I never had a chicken dish that stinks so bad. When we pointed this out, the restaurant manager asked us what is wrong. Either he does not know what a good food is or he is badly paid.

Had the fish pakora (deep fried fish morsels).  Very good and perfectly spiced.

The mixed grill (chicken, beef kabob, etc) was also quite good.  I was impressed by how fresh the grilled items were -- all were piping hot, which is nice to see.  Too often Indian restaurants reheat items grilled hours earlier, which leaves meat dry.  Not so here.

Service can be a little slow, but the courteous staff who are willing to please make up for it.  Good food though the chicken biriyani had some hard rice either from being undercooked or from drying out from the buffet warmer.  I usually don&#39;t eat samosa at a buffet, but the fam insisted that I have some. It was flakey and fresh. Salad was fresh. Kheer and halwa were delish. Great ala carte seekh kababs.

One notes though is that the &#39;waitress/hostess&#39; was not too welcoming.  She was not rude by any means....just indifferent.  She came over like 3 times in the first 10 minutes were were there to take our order (yes I know there is only one other occupied table there and you need something to do)....but I wanted to catch up with my friend a little before looking at the menu.   Then when we were ready to order, she didn&#39;t really seem interested in giving any menu ideas.   The interaction with her was just &#39;off&#39;.   It seems like she wanted to just seat us and take our order, but not have to interact with us and answer questions about the menu.

The owner (or someone with management) kept coming in and out of the front door area talking really loud on her cell phone and then walking through the restaurant talking really loud on the cell phone.  She did a few times during our meal...not just once.   So that was rude behavior.

Husband enjoyed his dish also  -   tender lamb tiiki masala chunks in a flavorful sauce. It was not red like many masala sauces but brown. daughter opted for the shahi paneer dish. We also ordered basamati rice (extra charge) and garlic naan that was grilled in the tandoor oven and was very good. We has enough left over for another meal (Indian food always tastes great reheated!)
Service was excellent. Drinks were refilled often. We will definitely come back again."

The area that they are located in has multiple layers of shopping and dinning establishments. If you&#39;re coming for the first time, it is right next to Houlihans. Staff friendly and we were seated right away. Food was definitely above par than what I had expected. We&#39;ve been to most of the Indian places in and around Joliet/Naperville area, and if I had to rank them I&#39;d say that this is second to Sher-A-Punjab and miles ahead of places like Masalla."

I had the grill platter #3, samosas, and Shahi Paneer

Best samosas we&#39;ve ever had, and my buddy spent 3 months all over India.

Shahi Panner was like a yellow curry/mild peanut sauce type of paneer and again, just delicious and hit the taste buds just right

This is how the grill platter #3 went down...The first thing I tried was the beef Gola Kebob.  I took a bite and tilted my head back, put my fork down, and gave a holy shit to my buddy.  I handed him a piece and we smiled at each other in that knowing way only age old friends can.  We immediately called our excellent waiter over and began to rave at him, not to him, but at him...there was enthusiasm and stars in our eyes

I won&#39;t lie, that first bite damn near ruined the rest of the meal to me because it was so delicious, everything else was pale in comparison, yet still very delicious.  I can&#39;t say enough about the food, our waiter, or the owner, who spent a few minutes with us enjoying our heartfelt smiles

If you like just the right amount of curry, too much ginger, and too much garlic, this is definitely the place you should eat next.  (You can ask them to adjust the spicyness to your taste) Every taste bud was fondled with every bite.  

Typically, I like chicken more than beef, the chicken Gola was delicious, but NOTHING stood out like this beef Gola.  I had never had it before, but unless I tragically die before I go here again, I will be eating it many times over

If I was gay, I would have proposed to the chef on the spot...hell, I might even anyways!

I can&#39;t wait to try their weekend lunch buffet, which the waiter highly recommended.  Nihari has a special place in my heart, and I&#39;m really excited to try theirs, which is included on their buffet

If you go here, you will walk out with a smile and the knowledge you made a great choice"

All the entrees we have tried are full of fresh ingredients and flavorful, the restaurant is clean, and the staff are very welcoming.  They are courteous, responsive, and they actually smile, qualities that are sorely lacking at most other Indo/Pak restaurants in the Chicago area.  It&#39;s one of the few Chicago area desi restaurants where you can actually walk out feeling like you just had a good dining out experience.  We live more or less equidistant from Sara&#39;s and Shahi Nihari&#39;s Villa Park location, and our entire family always prefers Sara&#39;s over Shahi Nihari!

I gave it 4 stars instead of five because there&#39;s room for improvement. There chai is straight up horrible, go figure. Wish they had  a better dessert menu to. Finally, service NEEDS improvement.

We got excruciatingly spicy appetizers although I specifically told the waitress I wanted it mild and she reassured me it can be accommodated. When I pointed it out, the response was, oh, I noted it on the order (like don&#39;t blame me.

I&#39;ve always had a love for middle eastern and Indian cuisine so I was eager to try out what Sara&#39;s had to offer. 

I was taken back to say the least. Immediately walking in I took notice to the beautiful detail in the wall coverings and the big picture window that allows you to see the cooks as they are hard at work. 

I tried the grill platter #3 and can say it was amazing! Everything about the flavors, and the freshness of the food is what makes this the best, and now my favorite, place to enjoy Indian food. 

The staff was very pleasant, and the atmosphere is one that forces you to sit back, relax and feel like you&#39;re right at home at your own table. I look forward to going back and trying some of the other platters and appetizers.

I went to this place after reading the reviews and I thought its a great place with a good food and service. It was a nightmare and worst decision I have ever made. 
The place is very small and not clean at all. So loud and crowded with poor environment. We were seated on a table and waited to be served forever. The manager who was a young gentleman, was nice and welcoming and took our order but later two different unfriendly waitress came each time to  serve and each has no idea about what we asked the other two. We waited forever for the food and finally here you go the food arrived after good amount of time waiting with some of the orders missing so we had to wait more for someone to show up to inform them about the missing stuff. 
The reviews says the food is good in quality and quantity!! I really have no idea who wrote those reviews and if they are reliable. The quantity wasn&#39;t equivalent to the price at all. The quality was seriously zero. The food didn&#39;t taste good at all. I couldn&#39;t touch the salad because looked old and saggy..I have been to many Indian and Pakistani restaurants before in Chicago and Chicago land and even in New York so I know how the good food should taste.

Its clear that the owners have invested a significant amount. However, there are some problems that need to be remedied to make the experience better:

- Don&#39;t try to cook all kinds of things and expand unnecessarily i.e. the menu includes turkish options and says available on some days (make clear which days!?) - should I just guess? And also, serve turkish bread with the kebabs, not naan.

-Although the waitresses were fine, the supervisor needs to be much more proactive asking customers about their experiences and what can be improved. You can&#39;t just stand in one place - this is expected of any good restaurant. The service was a tad bit slow.

- A bit less salt/oil in the food would be better - the food was nice but you get filled up too easily.

As a result, I decided I should add my two cents. The food is great. As to the people complaining about price, where else are you going to get quality of food for the price? The Wine selection is astounding and more than fair in price. 

Serivce is standard. The owner&#39;s wife, Martina, is more than accommodating and very nice. I have always been made to feel welcome. The other servers are quick to meet our needs even when they have not been assigned to us. Mike the weekend bartender is amazing and  when I came in for a birthday a few weeks ago as part of a table of 15, Melissa separated all of our bills and saw to it that all of us were taken care of quickly and professionally, even though we all came at different times.

I suppose anyone an have a bad experience, regardless of where you go. I suppose also that people are more likely to complain than compliment, but in all fairness this place is not bad at all.

Best early Christmas present we could get, and I firmly believe it was one of the top 2 best meals (best for me, second for my husband), we have ever had in a restaurant!!  

HIs best ever was at http://www.lasbrisaslagunabeach.com/  (and that was too long of a trip to make tonight!!)  :-)

Anyway, we were seated immediately, drink orders taken, and menus received within 2 minutes of sitting.  Very nice atmosphere and decor.  The restaurant was quite full when we got there, but by the end of the meal we were the last table remaining.  It was getting later on Christmas Eve after all.  Hopefully all of the staff got to go home soon thereafter!

We both started with soup.  He got the sherry-laced mushroom, and I got the Boston clam chowder.  They were both outstanding.  Perfectly balanced flavors, lots of crab in mine, and both piping hot.  A pet peeve of ours is lukewarm food, but especially soup.  With the bread provided on the table (with olive oil and parm, plus they brought the butter my husband asked for) this was the perfect start to the meal.

Our server (who turned out to be the wife of the &#34;rude&#34; owner complained about a couple of times here), could not have been nicer.  She told us her name, and sorry - I forget!!  But she offered lots of insight into the menu, made great suggestions for us both, and simply could not have been more gracious.  We talked with her a bit about the history of the restaurant, not remembering that it has been open as long as it has.  Made me ever sorrier this was our first visit.

I got the pork medallions, saut√©ed in a Crimini mushroom Dijonnaise sauce, served with potato gnocchi and green beans.  Husband got the New Zealand Spring Rack of Lamb Parmesan Crusted, on a bed of Ratatouille Provencail and topped with a Cabernet Sauvignon-Rosemary Lamb Reduction.  Everything on both plates was simply outstanding, perfectly cooked, and once again, piping hot.  

Can&#39;t wait to go back and start working our way through the entire menu.  So many tempting things to try!! Also look forward to going back to enjoy the outside area for cocktails with our doggie next summer.  Perfect place for a couple of cocktails and appetizers.

We very honestly could not be more excited to have this awesome place within walking distance in Lombard, nor recommend this restaurant more highly.  Again, thanks for the best Christmas Eve meal ever, Praga!!"

We all had a fish dinner so we paired white wine with it.  I had the scallop, shrimp, on pasta dish.  It also had some grilled asparagus which was perfect!

Sometimes you don&#39;t want to eat at a chain restaurant where everything is the same. I have been eating here for years, had my mom&#39;s 60th birthday dinner here, I&#39;ve never had any problems except they ran out of Miller light once so my date wasn&#39;t to happy about that. The food is always great, service is good most of the time. Sometimes it takes a little while to get served but I&#39;m not usually in a hurry."

My husband suggested a couple of other places but I said Praga is quiet. WRONG!!.  Walked in to find a family/Village of Lombard gathering which we thought we could deal with.  Seated, drinks brought, (not good).  Ordered our meals.(Very Good)  Then the speeches started from said gathering.Speeches!  Really?  Had to hold our conversation until they were done.  We were so uncomfortable! Felt we crashed their party. Wolf down our meals.  &#34;NO&#34; to dessert. &#34; NO&#34; to a second cocktail.  They should have shut down to a &#34;Private Party&#34; and suffered the loss.  So disappointed!!

I came here for part of a dog training class in which the owner of the training group and the owner of Praga had arranged for us to be there to enjoy drinks and apps and enjoy our dogs in public. I brought my mean dog (sigh) and was VERY anxious, but with a certified dog trainer there and a very dog friendly restaurant owner, my concerns were eased right away.

Hamish and I got our own table due to his aforementioned meanness, and the owner walked around to each of us and offered bowls of water and treats to each pooch there. Our server was awesome with the drink refills (mid afternoon = just diet coke for me), and the patio is a nice mix of privacy and people watching. 

Since it was lunchish, I ordered the Norwegian salmon roll up, as it seemed like a nice, fresh, light midday meal. It was AMAZING. It was delicious smoke salmon rolled around Brie cheese flavored with herbs (lots o&#39; dill!) and baby spinach. It was a generous portion, served upon more baby spinach and cucumbers, with a lovely herb-y dressing and house-made potato chips that were light, crispy, and a fabulous juxtaposition to the creamy salmon rollup. I ate every last bite!

We stayed about 1.5 hours, me in one chair and my dog in another, enjoying each other&#39;s company, delicious food, and the sights and sounds of Lombard along busy St. Charles road. Though next time I&#39;ll likely leave the pup at home and bring the husband along, I will definitely be returning!"

The waitress explained that the waitstaff was stretched thin. Polite, but super slow, inattentive service. The diners next to us made remarks about how their coffee took 30 mins to arrive. We ordered a flambe coffee from their menu, but later the waitress told us that the bartender didn&#39;t want to make it. Off-putting explanation. Waitress also smelled strongly of cigarettes. Bearable, but not desirable in a dining experience.

P.E.I. mussels ($10) - 4 stars. Delicious with a wine sauce, tomatoes. Would&#39;ve been better served with bread.

Beet, butternut squash, and goat cheese ravioli ($14) - 4 stars. Caramelized brussel sprouts and prosciutto pieces. Around 8 raviolis. Liked the goat cheese and beet pairing.

Beef short ribs ($15) - 2 stars. &#34;Braised and glazed with ginger, peach, chipotle, brown sugar, tomato sauce. Oriental stir fry root vegetable slaw. Sweet potato fries.&#34; After reading that description, I was excited to try it. But the execution was meh. Meat wasn&#39;t tender, forgettable taste. Slaw was a pass. Maybe 9 sweet potato fries, soggy, seemed like an afterthought to the dish. Presentation was a mess. Instead of this, get galbijjim from a decent Korean restaurant.

Raspberry Grand Marnier creme brulee ($7) - 3.5 stars. Tasty with a thick crust, but the inside texture wasn&#39;t the smooth creaminess that I look for in a creme brulee.

I liked the look of the menu, and the food was overall good except for one dish, so about a 3.5 star rating. The memorably poor service rounds it down to a 3."

Before my meal, I tried the mushroom soup that was on special.  The broth was made with sherry and there were nice big mushroom pieces throughout.  Great start to the meal.  For dinner, I went with the penne pomodoro with chicken, which was divine.  The sauce had a little cream in it making it smooth and a little more filling.  Even though I was full, I had to force some dessert because the ice cream with cherry sauce was calling to me.  That dessert was worth every last discomfort from my bursting stomach.

There is also a nice wine list for those who care to partake."

From outside the place is very unassuming and you could hardly guess that an upscale wine and martini lounge lays inside. The Yelp label says czech but the food has more of a french influence with the unique sauces on every dish and seasonal dishes like the escargot &#34;en Barquette&#34; with a small puff pastry. We also enjoyed as seasonal appetizer the duet of Maryland crab cakes (firm lump crab; no runny mayo). Every dish pegged it on the flavor scale including the pecan dusted walleye and a sesame crusted and seared yellow fin tuna. A rare find to see some many delicious fish options on the menu in the suburbs. The bar in the lounge made some great signature martinis. The staff were very attentive checking in frequently on our needs. I see other reviews cite this as insufficiently European but we would much rather have our needs addressed than be ignored. I cannot wait to go back when the weather is warm to try to dining al fresco on the patio."

Most recently we really loved the stuffed pear salad. They should probably change the menu to reflect the fact that they are pear slices, not whole pears. I almost didn&#39;t get it because I was turned off by the idea of a whole stuffed pear. 

I also love the pork tenderloin but the delicious creamy sauce can be a bit rich for my delicate constitution.

Go here and enjoy the food, wine and awesome outdoor patio."

We were hungry for dinner so we went here after a good recommendation from a co-worker who lives in Lombard and of course, the Yelp reviews.

First, there are two entrances - one for Bonton (the wine bar) and Praga (the restaurant).  We walked into the one for the restaurant around 7pm.  The waiting area is super small and fits no more than two people.  We were asked by an employee if we had made reservations.  We said no and she said she&#39;d see what she had available.  Another employee came back a few minutes later and led us to our table, which was a high top in the wine bar area (Bonton).  This would have been fine had I been able to drink.  However, I didn&#39;t want to since I was driving.  My boyfriend was kind enough not to drink either so I wouldn&#39;t be alone not drinking.

The wine bar looked great!  The ambiance and look was quite different from the dining room.  We sat right by the room with all the wine.  The downsides were that the bar was loud and especially for us since we were right by the bar and I could hear the bartender mixing all the drinks.  Also, they didn&#39;t turn on the Bulls game and instead had college football on.  I think I overheard someone ask for the Bulls game, but the bartender said no.  Not OK.

For dinner, I started with the sherry laced wild mushroom cream soup.  The soup was delicious and I enjoyed dipping the bread into it.  My boyfriend had the crab bisque soup, which was delicious.  He enjoyed it very much.

For our entrees, I had the jumbo walleye which came with white rice mixed with cilantro pieces, a corn and asparagus vegetable mix and some sort of butter sauce.  It tasted delicious.  I enjoyed the cilantro rice, which was a nice palette cleanser, which allowed me to go back in for more bites of the fish.  The fish was prepared nicely and melted in my mouth.  I enjoyed the vegetable mix and the sauce, but found it odd that rice and vegetables were on my plate.  I think maybe the rice was out of place despite it being very delicious.

My boyfriend had the prawns (three big pieces), which were served with asparagus (he found these to be a bit chewy) and mashed potatoes.  He enjoyed his entree.

For desert, we had the Raspberry Grand Mariner Creme Brulee.  It had the raspberries mixed in, which I was not a fan of.  I did not like the Grand Mariner and found the consistency to be off - sort of mealy instead of what it should be.  The brulee part was good.

Service overall was just OK.  I felt like our server could have been friendlier and I didn&#39;t feel like he totally made an attempt to make us feel welcome.

I may go back if in the area and request to sit in the dining room.

Bottom Line: 1) make reservations, 2) skip the Creme Brulee and 3) sit in the wine bar area if you want a more loud, vibrant atmosphere."

We heard it was a great restaurant in the suburbs so we decided to try it since there are so few. Well, it was definitely a &#34;BIG&#34; disappointment. First impression, the place was kind if small, which could be charming, but in this case, not so much. The owner was in a t-shirt and very rude. No welcome or hello, just where do you want to sit? Ok will let that slide. But then, the waitress came and she reeked of cigarettes!! Now, I understand that folks smoke, however if you are calling yourself a fine dining restaurant, your server cannot smell like an ashtray! It all went downhill from there. Food was ok, really heavy and not seasoned enough. Cocktails, ok. The winner I guess was one of the desserts which were cherries soaked in Amaretto. But not THAT good that I would come back. So, overall it felt like an overpriced DINER not a nice restaurant."

I called the Praga Restaurant phone number and had mentioned that it was a special occasions and if its possible to get a nice table, was told not a problem. We arrived on the day promptly at 7, and were walked to the Bonton (adjust bar) area of the restaurant, and were told we are going to be seated at one of the high tops. 

I disagreed and stated that I made reservation at Praga and explained that this is a birthday, to which the hostess/waiters shrugged and without any further attempts stated this is the only table they ahve available and they seat in both areas. Ok that&#39;s fine but how come no one mentioned this when I was making reservations and specifically asked for a nice table?

I asked to speak with the manager who could also care less. No apology, no attempt to make this up, we were seated with an elderly person at a high top table in a loud, dark bar area. Felt terrible, at that age every birthday is a gift and should be celebrated fully, but there is nothing we can do. 

Now as to the food and service. Service was ok, a bit rushed, waitress barely gave us a second to open our menus before she came back to get drink orders. Bread arrived and it seemed like a loaf you buy on sale at the grocery store, sliced. So strange, restaurant with steak houses pricing should be able to have a bit better quality of bread. 

As to the entrees, very underwhelmed. Extremely average, bland soupy seafood pasta dish, with two tiny scallops and two shrimps swimming in greasy brownish broth. And that&#39;s for $25 a plate. The rest of our party agreed on the same for their dishes. 

Save your money and go elsewhere, management clearly doesn&#39;t care about guest&#39;s requests and does whatever possible just to fill the space, plus food that is an Olive Garden quality for 3X the price."

Praga was just the right place. This restaurant offers unique menu options in a relaxed dining setting. They have a great out door patio, which would have been perfect if it wasn&#39;t 105F with max humidity. We sat inside, which was just fine. 

I started off with a cucumber martini, which was refreshing and delicious. BTW, thursday is $5 martini night!!! What a deal!!

We started with the Fromage appetizer. Yum and Yum. 

I went with the sea bass for my entree. It came with au gratin potatoes (to die for) and veggies. The sauce that was on the sea bass made this dish a home run. My husband had a steak, which I though was cooked perfectly (he thought it was a little rare, but he liked it anyways!)

Glad I live so close to Praga, because it is nice to have a place in the neighborhood that can offer spread like something you would find in Chicago."

That was fine with us as we grabbed a drink in the bar. However, after 30 minutes and multiple visits to ask when we would be seated, we finally sat down at 910p. 

The food was average and this was supported by our friends who had gone there several times prior and recommended this place. This visit however put them off for future visits. There was neither an apology nor offer of a drink or app due to the delay in seating. This is the reason for the 1 star.

Decided to try it last Saturday night and it was honestly one of the best meals we have EVER had! 

My husband ordered a soup as an appetizer that came out hot and delicious. He ordered the Veal Praga for dinner that had a mushroom sauce over it. I don&#39;t even like mushrooms and even that was incredible. I ordered the rack of lamb and it was absolutely AMAZING!!! I rarely clean my plate the way I did at Praga that night. Top it off with a delicious pear martini and wonderful cherries and ice cream for dessert... we were in heaven! Not to mention the service was excellent and the ambiance was delightful. 

We are so thrilled to have found this hidden gem in our new hometown! Our total bill was only about $80 but the quality of the food and service far surpassed what we paid.

Say it isn&#39;t so . . . I must be slipping.  But it was true.  And true to me, I had to rectify not having eaten at this place yet, with a visit on a recent Friday night.

We had an early reservation (made the old school way- ya gotta call).  When we arrived, we had a choice of several tables, one by the window, one tucked away in a corner and one in the separate bar area.  The corner table won out as it had a little more room and boy did we need it!

First up- a couple of their appetizer specials of the day.  The raw oysters were fresh and served with the expected condiments, but the scallops were amazing!  Seared lightly and served over a mushroom risotto, it was plate licking worthy.

Next up- I had the heirloom tomato caprese salad and my dining companion had the cream of mushroom soup.  Equally as good.

And then the entrees.  My cheese and mushroom stuffed veal chop was perfectly cooked, and falling off the bone.  And the &#34;Praga veal&#34; (a more traditional approach with spatzle and sweet and sour red cabbage) was noteworthy as well.

The food came up fast, which was good as there was a misstep with service up front as the server thought she had already taken our order but she hadn&#39;t.  No problem, though.  She got us right back on track.  

Parking is a breeze as there is a lot right next door and in the Summer months there is a nice patio out front which would be a great place to enjoy a dinner.  Dinner for 2 with a couple glasses of wine ran about $130.

Praga is a find!  Now I just wonder how it stayed off my radar for so long?"

Several seafood specials - the striped bass was excellent and thankfully they cooked it naked (no carb loaded coating!).  My husband had the fillet medallions that were excellent, and  a friend of ours the stuffed pork chop which he loved.  

Must try the Fromage onion tart as an appetizer.  

We had great service last night, however getting seated can be a little awkward as they don&#39;t really have an indoor hostess station."

The food is decent but the service and manager skills ruins it for me.  You will wait forever to get a waiter to your table and they will have a bad attitude.  The food will take too long to get to the table.  Although it will seem like pretty good food, you&#39;ll have to ask yourself, is this REALLY good? OR am I just really hungry from waiting for so long?

Don&#39;t bother ordering a drink because it will take 20 minutes to get it.  And really don&#39;t waste your time going next door to Bonton for a night cap because it will just end up ruining your night.

1-Star for the food, the service, and ownership took away the other 4 stars."

Not exactly the first place I think of for superior food but we were so pleased with our experience, I decided to invite others to partake of this superior restaurant.  [BTW, it was new to us but the establishment has been operating for 11 years according to our waitstaff.]

We dined on a Wednesday, which was quiet to say the least.  Two other tables were being served.  We were, obviously, seated promptly, brought water, bread, and asked for drinks within a few seconds.  The rest of the meal was very well paced considering there was no crowd.  Bread is only so so but were we taken aback when our first course arrived, blue point oysters on the half shell.  Very mild and well detached from the shell; not a whisper of grit or sand.

My wife had the house chop salad, served nicely in a large margarita glass and it was fresh, tasty, and dressed with just the right amount of oil/vinegar/spices.  I would say it actually exploded in your mouth.  I had their wild mushroom cream soup with sherry, which was to die for.  Rich earthy flavor, nice texture and size to the mushrooms, nice note of sherry, and not too much cream as to make the soup too heavy.  Outstanding!

My wife&#39;s entree was Veal Praga, strips of veal sauteed with mushrooms and onions, served with spaetzel and red cabbage.  She could not stop raving about this choice, until she had finished every morsel, a rarity for her.  It was rich and complex with a hind of sherry or brandy.  This signature dish hints at the heritage and underpinning of the restaurant&#39;s menu--Modern European.  There are two other veal options, a few beef offerings, as well as pork and chicken.  Not fish entrees on the regular menu.

But the specials included two fish dinners.  I chose the Scottish salmon served over mascarpone mashed potatoes with a corn/asparagus accompaniment.  Simply superb.  Nicely crusted, not overcooked, and absolutely no fishy/salmony flavor or scent.  The extras on this dish we equally good and balanced well to the fish.

We had room for no more and were also pleasantly surprised when the check was presented, especially since we had 4 drinks.  While not an inexpensive meal, it was extremely fair for the quality, but remember this is not a &#34;family&#34; restaurant and the choices are all a la carte.  Those folks who have complained about price need to stick to Denny&#39;s or even the immensely overrated Glen Prarie restaurant a few blocks away in the Crown Plaza on Roosevelt, which is just a few dollars less per entree than this wonderful, comfortable restaurant.  

Do yourself a favor, skip going downtown Chicago for a &#34;special&#34; night.  There is a very special restaurant just down the street in, of all places, Lombard.  Bon Appetite."
praga-restaurant-lombard,Kristen H.,2YhFB-VoyCrpKwXKEHoOvg,"Chicago, IL",0,1,1,41,3,u7McjyyRSisq68VTVBpXPA,2.0,2014-09-14,"Based off the asparagus salad, bread, and wine, this location gets two stars, and for service I would put zero stars. My boyfriend and I had been dying to try Praga Restaurant for some time now and finally  had the chance to do so. We were immediately greeted and sat on their lovely patio that overlooks the peaceful traffic of downtown Lombard.  We had  bread and olive oil ready for us and my red wine was full of body and flavor. Our waitress appeared nice at first but that all changed until I ordered my food. As a vegetarian, I have special dietary needs, and I tend to be understanding if a restaurant has a small selection, and typically I move around this and substitute or subtract something from the meal. I already knew what I wanted before we arrived, because we had looked at the menu. I wanted their squash ravioli with beets and brussel sprouts. The only thing on the ravioli that I did not want  was their prosciutto glaze that was on top, which I did not believe to be an issue. Apparently, it was to the waitress, who believed that she knew what I would like better than me. When I stated that I did not want the prosciutto glaze, she stated that the dish would not then work because it would be bland, and I said that is fine (because I did not want to argue and know that I would  like it especially with those three particular veggies), but the waitress would not budge. She literally would not let me order it that way, until finally she agreed to just have a red sauce on the side for me which I just consented to in order to make her go away. I would never put red sauce on top of those vegetables and the sheer fact that she was not confident enough the restaurant could not cook anything but bland ravioli was discouraging. I chose to move on from the incident and we enjoyed our grilled asparagus with gorgonzola cheese and pecans which was phenomenal. As our entrees were served, I  noticed that the red sauce was all over the ravioli AND not on the side. I decided to still give it a try, but instantly regretted it. It tasted just like bland cheese ravioli with marina sauce and I become upset. When I addressed the waitress about the issue, she again wanted to argue with me and reiterated the fact that the vegetables were inside the ravioli. The beets were but I only tasted one piece of squash in all of the ravioli and definitely not the brussel sprouts. She brought me a side of brussel sprouts which were mushy and disgusting and I could not even finish eating them. I began to notice the way she treated her table next to us in a kind manner and was almost trying to avoid me, possibly because she believed me to be too demanding. I will never return to Praga by choice again, and I will tell all of my vegetarian friends to stay away as we are obviously not welcome here!"

In a word, the dinner was phenomenal.   We had an artisan cheese sampling plate as an appetizer and it was excellent.   I had a seafood pasta that was good (I won&#39;t say great, but good), my friend had a melt-in-the-mouth Filet Mingon, and my wife won the &#34;I ordered the best thing at the table award.&#34;  It was a pork chop stuffed with spinach, pancetta, and some kind of cheese, and served with caramelized brussel sprouts.  

Our server was incredibly attentive and personable.  This is definitely a hidden treasure - I&#39;d advise people not to skip it because of it&#39;s unassuming exterior."
praga-restaurant-lombard,Rob B.,o2jTQnnZAnNleBjeec5joA,"Chicago, IL",0,1,0,18,124,wR83FXbMsbaBN12jOUwLEg,3.0,2012-01-21,"Praga really earned about 3.5 stars for our dinner, but I dropped that extra .5 due to the final bill.

So there we were driving out to Glen Ellyn after doing some holiday shopping, and we were very hungry. I was driving by all sorts of fast food on Roosevelt when I remembered seeing Praga and Bonton just up the road. I figured if we needed to hang for 10 minutes, no big deal. I love Culvers and Arbys and all the greasy speed eats too, but we needed food of substance.

They open at 4:30 (yay!) and we got our choice of the dining room, naturally. We sat down in the nicely decorated dining area and our server came right over to get us started with menus, water and bread with herb infused oil. The bread was good, but the oil was bland.

We ordered a crab cake appetizer and our entrees were Scallops and Veal Scallopine. As we were ordering, another table of 4 came in and were seated directly next to us. The staff knew them and exchanged greetings which made me more mad that they were a loud table. The staff should have known not to sit the noisy table next to a couple dining in an otherwise empty restaurant.

So after our bread course our waiter swings by to clear the plates and do &#34;the crumb scrape&#34; which took a hilarious 4 minutes due to the over abundance of tablecloth accent pieces. There was a centerpiece diamond that was too large, and it was upside down so the crumbs kept getting stuck in the seams. It was a real conversation buster.

The crab cakes came. 5 star, amazing. Great texture, great flavor, the corn was a nice touch in the cake as well. If I was getting sauced at Bonton next door, I&#39;d have cakes to keep me company. If you&#39;re going to stop in, get the cakes.

The jovial folks next to us were just getting their food served as my wife and I were looking around to see if the waiter could give us an update. There was about an 30 minute gap between appetizer and entree even though we ordered everything at the same time. Just as we got his attention, the plates came shooting out of the kitchen. 

So next up was our entrees which were also 4-5 star quality. The sauces were good and the scallops were cooked just right, not tough, but with a nice searing on the exterior. It truly was a nice show from the chef of the evening between the cakes and entrees, and it certainly beat the pants off of anything else we were considering in the area.

When our bill came, that&#39;s when I started taking the stars away. We spent well over $100 between the two of us. I really don&#39;t mind dropping the bills on a dinner but if you charge over $50 per person, you better get things right. For that bill, there should have been better management of the dining room, and more attentive service. I felt like it was a pretty poor value. It makes some of my favorite restaurants that much more of a treasure since they provide great food with amazing service for about half the price.

Praga could be a 4-5 star establishment with some more attention to what happens outside of the kitchen."

I took my Dad here to celebrate the big day of Dads, it was both of our first time eating here and not a disappointment at all. Ooh- and as an extra bonus, it was nice out so we ate on the storefront patio outside. 

The service was great, all of the staff were so humble and friendly and made you feel welcome and appreciated without any coddling. 

The food is labeled as Eastern European but with none of the heavy meats and cheeses that you&#39;d expect. My Dad said that calling it American would give people a better idea of their menu beforehand. As a vegetarian, I made sure to check out the menu prior to my visit to make sure there&#39;d be something there for me, and ooooOOOOooooh was it good. They have a specials list that varies on the day you go but it&#39;s really extensive... several appetizer options, soup and salad options, LOTS of fresh fish entrees, and dessert. The daily specials menu here is bigger than a lot of restaurants real menu. 

My Dad and I got the Fromage appetizer ( goat cheese baked with caramelized onions, spinach, and red pepper wrapped in phyllo dough with a yummy pink tomato basil sauce) and the special salad that had spinach leaves, grapefruit slices, candied pistachios, grilled asparagus, and a really great vinaigrette dressing. Both items were mouth wateringly good... I&#39;m defo going to try to steal the salad recipe to make on my own time, maybe call it Candice&#39;s Summer &#39;09 Salad. 

For dinner my Dadio got the chicken dish with mashed potatoes. It looked good and was stuffed with peppers, spinach and other yummy goodness. He finished every bite of it. I saw another table with some sort of braised beef tomahawk looking dish and it was really a sight to see. I had to keep turning around to check it out like there was a celebrity sitting behind me or something. 

I got the vegetarian special which was seared polenta cakes on a bed of marinated spinach with a mixture of mushrooms, peas, asparagus, and some sort of dee-lish sauce. I, too, ate every bit of it. 

For dessert I got the &#34;Tony&#39;s&#34; crepes. They are banana crepes covered in syrup with vanilla ice cream and dried banana chips... served WHILE ON FIRE and then the dessert chef pours a ladle of something... I want to say Gran Marnier on top it. Twas dreamy... though some of my bites tasted like pure alcohol, it&#39;s hard to complain about getting a buzz from dessert. 

I&#39;m so recommending this to friends. Even for vegetarians, though there&#39;s not a huge selection- they are superb."

My wife and I each had some well-made martinis on the well-designed outdoor patio, but not before our appetizer of soup. Not a lot of soup, but some of the tastiest liquid one could ever slurp. Her asparagus-leek soup was quite good, but I&#39;ve never had anything like the sherry-mushroom soup, which is a staple at Praga. The martinis were smooth and well-balanced. 

Then the entrees came. A pleasant basmati-ginger rice lined both of our plates. My wife&#39;s tilapia was accompanied by a tasty sauce and seasoned corn mixture. But I ordered the seared tuna, flavored with sesame and brought together by a sauce of caramel-soy that left us wondering what exactly was in it and how could it taste as good as it did. I&#39;ve never had tuna that didn&#39;t come out of a can; I&#39;m now spoiled by this dish and happily so. It easily rivals any dish eaten at 302 West, an incredible restaurant that thrived in downtown Geneva before the owner passed away. (One employee of 302 West was Pavel, who went on to start Praga.)

Though we were happily full, we were able to indulge in dessert, and I&#39;m not kidding, but I couldn&#39;t stop smiling while eating the malted-milk cheesecake. It was that good. If it had been a cooler night, we would likely have ordered 302 Coffees, a delicious drink that no one else seems to get. 

I apologize for not being more creative with my descriptions of the meal. But is was astoundingly good, and i can&#39;t think of another meal I&#39;ve enjoyed more.

I&#39;ve read the negatives that people have given about Praga. They&#39;re service is not as instantaneous as some would like, and I get that. But I know for a fact that they&#39;re short-staffed, and that they haven&#39;t moved their prices in years. In this economy, something&#39;s gotta give, and we didn&#39;t mind waiting a little longer for our courses, especially one that achieves such a level of excellence, a work of art by a culinary master. (Can you tell how much I liked the tuna?)

Downtown Lombard is struggling. I don&#39;t think enough people know how great this place is, and it&#39;s likely because of the location. St. Charles Rd. is no state route. But it&#39;s in my town, I love that it&#39;s here, and we plan on frequenting it as much as we can. It&#39;s the type of place that you&#39;d expect in Naperville and Elmhurst and possibly be ignored. It&#39;s a crown jewel of Lombard, but is it pearls before the porcine? Seriously, are Lombardians too short-sighted to recognize the value of the extra cost? And why do they choose Claim Jumper over and over again? Strange."

Really, I can&#39;t wait to go back so I can try more items off the menu. First and foremost, I&#39;ll agree with another reviewer&#39;s husband who dubbed the food more American than &#34;family style European.&#34; I have no idea where that description came from but it wasn&#39;t the portion size or the menu selection. Anyway, on to the good stuff. 

We had a 7:30 p.m. reservation for two and arrived at 7:35. The Praga dining room was full so we were seated at a table along the back wall in Bonton, the adjoining wine bar. I preferred the quieter lounge atmosphere and space of Bonton so that was serendipitous. We were greeted promptly by our fabulous server, Pavel T. He was friendly and enthusiastic about the food in a way that wasn&#39;t annoying but rather, contagious. 

The free bread was of 2-star quality. No flavor and cold. The olive oil was okay but rather plain. No shaved cheese, no anything. 

Pavel brought our wine and calamari appetizer quickly. The wine list was, as everyone mentions, extensive. The calamari was a perfect portion for an appetizer for two. It came with a salsa-like dipping sauce we both enjoyed. Flavorful but not spicy. 

Our entrees arrived just as we finished the calamari. I ordered chicken stuffed with sun-dried tomatoes and goat cheese in a Marsala sauce, which came with mashed potatoes. YUM. I practically licked my plate. The sauce was delicious and the chicken was cooked to perfection. My husband had the filet mignon in a mushroom sauce on fingerling potatoes with spinach. He liked his best, I liked mine best. Both were delicious. 

We topped it all off with the bread pudding. I really hate bread pudding but liked Praga&#39;s enough to try several bites. It came with homemade whipped cream and fresh berries. My husband was in love. 

For two glasses of wine, calamari, filet mignon, stuffed chicken, and dessert our bill totaled $80. Great price, great service, great meal. We&#39;ll be back."

The atmosphere was friendly and relaxed.  Many diners appeared to be regulars.  Praga had just switched over to their fall menu.  I had terrific, juicy, tender duck breast over winter squash and red cabbage.

Service was friendly, provided by someone who truly knows and loves the food.  The Bonton Wine Bar in the storefront next door (and connected at the back of the restaurant) ensures you have a good choice of wines for dinner.  It looks like a great place to have a chat with a friend or take a date.

I found the storefront a bit difficult to find, approaching from the west on a busy street.  The sign over the front was hidden by trees.  My trusty car nav said I was &#34;there&#34; so I parked and walked and found it.  My friend had the same issue.   No problem -- I&#39;ll definitely be back."

The food here was pretty good.  It&#39;s been about a year since I&#39;ve gone, so sadly I can&#39;t remember the dishes I had; however, I remember the lobster bisque and the bar was convenient with a nice selection of wines and beers (nice when you arrive early and are waiting on others  -- as I was).

Ambiance was a definite plus.  The outdoor patio was very nice.  I went in late spring so it had a bit of a chill (not the restaurants fault), but with the park nearby and the trees around, definitely a nice place to take someone."

I travel a lot for work and find myself in new cities, so finding good food is a must. There is plenty of parking in a lot close to the restaurant. 

I was early, so the place was empty, and a little darker than I like. I took my time perusing the specials, wine list (book), dinner menu, and martini list. I went with the scallops special, but started with the stuffed pear salad. The salad was...meh. I was expecting it to be delicous. It *looked* delicious and pretty. But it needed salt. And there was no salt or pepper on the table. Another reviewer was correct, the oil for the bread service is bland/boring, and almost tasted a little rank. Skip it. 

The scallop entree was really really really good. The scallops themselves were perfectly seared on the outside and had that lovely buttery flavor good scallops have. They were served over yukon gold mashed potatoes, with a corn/asparagus mascarpone sauce. I ate every morsel and wished for more. The portions are European (smaller), so it&#39;s totally doable. 

I had the bread pudding for dessert...not great. The strawberry tasted as if it had been sliced with the same knife that sliced onions.

I wanted to try everythingon the menu, so I&#39;m sure the majority is really good. I&#39;d go back. I just wouldn&#39;t get the pear salad or the bread pudding."

My husband had the tuna and I had the salmon. Both entrees were excellent and the portions generous.  Praga has a  broad wine list and their house wines are decent. The dessert menu is large and we enjoyed splitting a raspberry Grand Marnier creme brulee. mmm.

Praga has street front outdoor tables that are surrounded by flowering plants.  On Saturday nights during the summer there are car shows on the street and it is rather noisy but tonite it was a relatively quiet early fall evening  and we lingered over a wonderful dinner.

There is street parking in front and a large lot 2 storefronts away.

Servers were attentive. There is currently a special running. 10% off dinner if you show your Lombard library card."

Decided this time to try their food as well as their martini. The food is good. Pork chop was too salty. Crab cake too mushy. But everything else was delish. The scallops were cooked perfectly. The chicken wings were so crispy and I love the batter for the calamari. Light and crispy. The only suggestion I would have is possibly have a more variety of vegetables. Squash, sweet potatoes or broccoli wouldn&#39;t hurt. Everything we had was accessorized with corn. It was good but everything looked so yellow!  Great wine list. The martini was good. When I disliked the raspberry martini right away waitress exchanges for another.  Definitely we will go there for food and drinks. If only drinks will go before 10 so we can order those chicken wings!"

Not often that I go somewhere and everything on the menu sounds amazing.  I had the Pork Rack with spinach and onion rings....tasted excellent.  My wife had duck with ravioli and cabbage, also good.  Had the &#39;pinwheel&#39; appetizer before this...also great.


This place did everything right in my opinion.  Not badly priced."

Scallops were lively.

Family style European restaurant with a flair for quality.   Pleasant service compliments the delicious food.   

Nice selection on the menu.  Extensive beer and wine menu along with various desert selections.

Within the past year, Praga has steadily gone downhill.  During this time, I have dined with them three different times.  Out of these three times, I have made reservations a couple of days in advance and had them confirmed with the hostess.  All three times, my party has arrived on time and they have told us that there are no more tables left and escorted us to wait in the gloomy bar area/dungeon.  What&#39;s the point of a reservation?  

This last time, today, my mother wanted to have their famous Mother&#39;s Day Brunch.  So after making reservations weeks in advance, when we arrived right on time, we were told that all of the tables were taken and we were escorted to the gloomy bar area, Bonton, where we waited 15 minutes for someone to ask us if we wanted something to drink. We then waited another HALF AN HOUR to be seated.  So a 45 minute wait in total for a party that made reservations far in advance. This was the third time that this exact situation has happened to me there.  I didn&#39;t make the reservation to have my mom sit at a bar for close to an hour and not eat.

When the waiter came to our table to bring us to our seat, instead of apologizing for the extended delay and inconvenience, he simply said &#34;Ready?&#34;

I couldn&#39;t believe it. Nice Mother&#39;s Day for my mom.

The food is sometimes awful/overcooked and sometimes amazing; you never can tell what you are going to get.  But the one thing you definitely can expect is plan on being inconvenienced over and over again at this place in some way, shape or form."

After many suggestions and lots of reviews read, I decided that Praga was the restaurant for my wife and I to celebrate......they didn&#39;t disappoint either! 

First off, service was phenomenal! Megan was our server and she was delightful, personable and made the whole dining experience very relaxing! We started out each getting our own appetizers, seeing how my wife and I have different tastes on certain things but she&#39;s starting to like more of the items that I always order. She had the Stuffed Pear with Gorgonzola Salad, so good.....she let me try it! I went with the Jumbo Lump Crab Cake, one of the best I&#39;ve ever had! 

For our entrees....my wife had the House Cut &#34;New York&#34; Steak with Gorgonzola mashed potatoes, to die for. I enjoyed the New Zealand Lamb Rack Parmesan Crusted served with the most unbelievable potato gratin, this coming from a person who usually dislikes potatoes done that way, so good I was taken back. The portion sizes are very generous and every bite was better than the previous! 

Dessert was a must, usually a skipped item at other establishments. My wife went with the Fresh Berry Creme Brulee, had no complaints. I went with the &#34;New Orleans Style Bread Pudding&#34;, not what I expected looks wise but some of the best I&#39;ve ever had! It looked more like a cake but was it really good, fresh berries to go with it and an unbelievable caramel pecan whipped cream on the side, again, to die for! 

All in all, this has been one of the nicest and best restaurants that we have been to in awhile, so happy we decided to go. Service is top notch, food is wonderful and we will definitely be going back, also recommending them to all of our friends/family!"

The atmosphere is cozy and great for a date night.  The food is consistently great, from the veal to the rack of lamb.  The mushroom soup is out of this world.  Easy parking and the benefit of the connected bar.  My only complaint would be the owner always seems so stressed and crabby.  Ok, business is not great, but with that attitude and the rude way in which you talk to your staff is a huge issue."

I dined at Praga Friday night and it was a lovely experience.I&#39;ve lived in Lombard for pretty much my whole life and we always drive past this place but for some reason have been scared to try it but not Friday night! We arrived at about 6ish and it was pretty empty which made me sad but quickly it filled up.So if your going I would recommend making a res. but if not there is a swanky lil bar attached called bonton you could have drinks at.

The meal:

Drinks---if you like beer go for the Czech beer Golden Pheasant or if you like wine their selection is out of hand!

Apps: My mom and I shared the Gorgonzola stuffed pear salad.OMG it was probably the best salad I have ever had! 

Din Din: I had the only vegetarian option a delish spinach penne pomodoro pasta.So good
 my carnivore mom and Bf had the stuffed chicken breast with mashed tatos and string beans.They both polished it off.
My daddy had the seared sesame crusted Tuna which he claimed was the best he&#39;d ever had.

So the pros are the  meal was delicious, the waiter was a really nice man, all the customers were really nicely dressed and good looking,  the drinks were amazing, and the menu changes often.

The cons are that arent very veggie friendly, kinda pricey and........ hmmm thats all I got"

Praga was recommended to me by a co worker of mine.. who also lives in Lombard.  It was date night for me and my husband, which is quite rare on a Friday night.  Without reservations we were sat immediately in a very cute and warm dining room and the service started immediately.. which was nice. 

As soon as we got our menus and water was poured.. my husband quite the stickler when going out noticed that the silverware was quite spotty, ie water spots.. it didn&#39;t really bother me. The wine list that was given to us was quite expansive we ordered a nice cab from a Paul Hobbs winery in Argentina.. (which averaged $32) our server though brought to us a $100+ Paul Hobbs Cab and swore that that was the one we ordered.. I know wine and I know that that was not the one we ordered. After about 15 minutes he finally came back with the one I had asked for.. it was quite yummy!

We ordered the escargot app and it was quite good, but it was too rich.. too much cream, but the flavor profiles were great. We then ordered our dinners, my husband ordered the duck breast and I ordered the lamb shank... it was around 7ish when we ordered our entrees and the server thought they may have been out of my entree... it&#39;s a Friday night at 7pm, and it wasn&#39;t that busy.. come on....

We get our entrees and my husband&#39;s duck breast was over cooked and you could tell that my shank was the last one, the texture wasn&#39;t quite right.. and then we found out that the spatzel that  was served with the lamb shank was not made there.. you could tell it was out of a bag... The caramelized root vegetable ragout though saved the dish, it was fantastic...

We ordered dessert Bananas Foster.. and again our server was like... it may be the last one... it was 7:45? Yikes... we did get it.. and it was fantastic! Yummy, yummy...

All and all, it was good.. but there were too many quirks.. oh did I mention the steak knives were from IKEA??? We will probably go back and give it another try.. they have an outdoor area which looks really quite nice... good for a great summer evening!

We do have to say, in old downtown Lombard there aren&#39;t really any fine dining places... this is the only one.. and we think it could only get better."

The stuffed pear salad was amazing.  On the large side, well dressed.  Husband had the roasted squash bisque.  It was phenomenal.
His entree, duck breast was better than mine.  I had the Veal and Spaetzle it was very good, but the duck was phenomenal.  
Only room for improvement is the front door opens to the dining room and a large coat rack.  Standing there waiting to be seated is awkward."

In a city where food is reason enough to visit,  Praga, in Lombard should be on your list too.

My fiance and eating companion says that the way to his heart in a restaurant is a constant supply of bread, and the waitress kept us well stocked with carbs and drinks throughout the night.  Even when the place became completely packed toward the end of our meal, service didn&#39;t slack one bit.

We split a lobster/phyllo appetizer, which was a flavor orgasm and had decent chunks of lobster for only $7!  The sea-bass had a deliciously crispy sear on it, and my dessert - banana rum crepes - were equally palate-pleasing.  It was definitely worth the drive and all the wrong turns we made trying to find it!"

We arrived at 6:30 (I know, early for us younger folk) on a Saturday and were immediately seated at a lovely table near the window. Our server was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and drinks. We decided to forgo appetizers and instead start with a round of martinis, quite good and a nice selection of specialty drinks. The wine list was huge (!) and most selections are available by the bottle or glass. 

For entrees, we ordered the scallops, stuffed chicken breast, striped bass (on special that night) and blackened NY strip. Each was served with a unique side dish pairing. The scallops were served with a spinach risotto that was rich in color and taste and the striped bass I ordered came with polenta parmesan fries which I absolutely loved!! The ambiance was very intimate and cozy, the menu was small but filled with unique offerings, service was quick and personable -all in all, a recommended pleasurable Saturday evening."

Pavel (the owner and master chef) is a genius when it comes to creating unique and extremely tasty European dishes.  His wife, Martina, is a wonderful hostess.  We have been there on numerous occasions and have absolutely loved every one.  They have a good wine list, which is reasonably priced - international selection of wines.  Appetizers and salads are each a unique creation.  Entreees (and we have tried almost every one of them) are rich in flavor, unique in the blend of meats, vegetables and garnishes, and always served in such a pleasing presentation.  It is best to make a reservation on a weekend, and, admittedly, there are some nights when service can suffer a bit if they are extremely busy - especially true in the summer months when all tables outside are full.  Nonetheless, overall we have always had an excellent experience.  They do no rush you - it is like an elegant European dining experience - right in the heart of Lombard!  Our favorite evening is on a summer Saturday evening, when Lombard hosts classic car night (Cruisin&#39; Nights), get there early (5:30 -6:00), enjoy a wonderful meal in the evening sunlight, and then walk around and check out the classic cars.  By 7:00 to 8:00 they are usually very crowded and then, admittedly, it gets more hectic for them, but we are near the end of our meal by that time, and have enjoyed a wonderful, relaxed international dining experience.."

I went here with my wife and my in-laws, back during the first week of January while we were back in Chicago for the holidays. The first thing I loved about the place was the music they were playing. I have a fairly eclectic taste when it comes to music, preferring downtempo european electronica and chillout, and that was exactly what they had on the sound system that evening.

Music aside, the place was small, intimate, and dimly lit. I love restaurants with atmosphere, and this place had plenty of it. With the snow on the ground outside, watching the cars drive past outside of the huge windows at the front of the restaurant, it just made for a nice evening that made me feel more like I was in Lincoln Park than Lombard.

The food... oh my god the food. The BEST, absolute BEST scallops I have ever tasted in my life, followed by one of the best steaks I have ever had. Everyone else in my party enjoyed their food as much as I enjoyed mine. To top it all off, the service was top notch. This is my new favorite restaurant in the western suburbs. It is a little out of the way, but the drive is well worth it."

Last week we celebrated a significant birthday for my husband with a party of 34 family and friends.  The owners opened up Praga on a Sunday afternoon for our party.  Earlier they helped us choose a menu and wine pairings which gave our guests a number of delicious choices.  Service by Maureen, Mitch and Erin was outstanding.  They couldn&#39;t have been more helpful and the food and wine were served seamlessly. The first 45 minutes were spent in Bonton and the outside patio with wine and cocktails as the guests arrived, then we moved into the restaurant which had a lovely, intimate quality.  Our choices for appetizers were the crab cakes or the fromage onlon tart; a choice of mushroom or vegetable minestrone soup or caesar salad; for entrees, a choice of pork chops, stuffed chicken breast, diver scallops or oven roasted salmon; and dessert, chocolate mousse, profiterolles or black cherries/ice cream.  Our guests all said the food was delicious.  
My favorites at Praga are always the scallops, the onion tart and the mushroom soup.

As a main course I ordered one of the specials which was pecan crusted halibut served over sauteed spinach and parsnips.  My wife ordered the veal medallions served over mushroom risotto.  Neither one of us could have been more happy with our dishes. The food presentation and atmosphere is also very nice at this restuarant.  

If you are looking to get away from the chains in the suburbs and want a more intimate experience with top notch food, this is a great place.

Definitely in agreement with everyone here that the food here is very good. And they have a huge drink selection as well. For appetizers, we had the goat cheese tart and the calamari.  Both were delicious, although i thought that the tart had a lot more onion than cheese but it was still very good. Two of us decided on the scallops with risotto for our entree and my other friend chose a chicken dish. All of us had the stuffed pear salad which was excellent. Our waiter forgot to put in our orders for the salad, and we got our entrees first.  He was very apologetic about it and although it wasn&#39;t a big deal to us cuz we got the salads anyway later, he was nice enough to throw in the dessert we ordered for free!

We sat inside initially because it was so hot outside. I had made reservations, but the table was not ready until 20 minutes after our promised reservation. I can understand a small delay (5-10 minutes) in a small restaurant, but 20 minutes was a little long. 

We waited in the bar (Bonton) which I highly recommend! Bonton is open very late when it is hard to find late night spots in the burbs. The decor is very urban and sleek. The bartender was very attentive and helpful. 

Once called to our table, our server was excellent!!!!!! We really liked her very much and showed our appreciation in a large tip. After dinner, we took coffee and dessert outside on the patio. The temperature cooled off slightly and it was a beautiful evening. I definitely suggest sitting outside on a nice evening. 

Now I&#39;ll chat about the food. I had the stuffed pear salad (which was excellent) and the seafood pasta. The pasta had scallops, shrimp, and a large portion of lobster meat. Another guest had the same dish and we both enjoyed it very much. The other two guests had a beef dish that looked like marinated beef tips. One of the guests strongly disliked the meal, but the other thought it was OK. Everyone liked their salads. The bread pudding dessert was great, especially since it did not contain raisins which I dislike. 

All in all, it was a fun night. My food was delicious but other guests would not agree. It is a great late night/outside dining choice. It is a little pricey."

For lunch I recommend any of their salads or sandwiches.  Their version of  a chopped salad is excellent.  If you are feeling hungry their beef tenderloin sandwich is the way to go.

I really like their roasted beets and polenta fries.  Had both with good wine recently and was well sated.  Their linguini with shrimp has a bit of a spicy kick and is my favorite dinner entree along with the risotto of the day, hard to say which one I enjoyed more.  Nice chicken and steak options too.

Nice outdoor dining area.  Nice service, rustic feel.   And, (BONUS!!!!) you can shop to your heart&#39;s content before or after dining!  What&#39;s not to love????"

I was able to have a delicious lunch of caprese salad and their homemade cavatelli with sausage for about $25. And their complimentary fresh bread and oil/giardiniera really completes the meal.  Great atmosphere and the wine selection was pretty impressive.  

The meal itself was very addicting.  Every ingredient tasted fresh and this was definitely one of the better cavatelli dishes I&#39;ve had.  The sauce for the pasta was bright, seasoned well and went so well with the sausage.  Omg, that&#39;s some good sauseege.  The service is what gave it a 4 for me.  While the host did a fantastic job at seating me (and explained the menu and the specials in less than 15 seconds) the waiter seemed like he would have rather been doing something else.  Overall, the meal was great and will be the reason why I&#39;ll return."

We came in for dinner and had a slight wait... Which is fine since we didn&#39;t make a reservation and the restaurant was packed to the gills.

When sat we got sat at a very cramped table right by the bathroom... Never usually like a table like that, but they were busy.

Server assistants came quickly with oil and cheese, and water. Big Plus.

Server whisked by and went over specials, which all sounded fantastic. We asked for a couple of sodas, regular sodas... Not diet.

Five minutes later our server swung by and announced to diets... Nope. We asked for regular. After another five minutes he came back with the correct beverages.

The husband then ordered the soup of the day. Cream of Brussels Sprouts with Bacon. It was quite fantastic.

For dinner we ordered two of our favorites.... Spaghetti Bolognese and Gnocchi Delicati. 

We received our dinners... My Gnocchi was quite fabulous! (As always) But my husbands entree was a whole different story. It was watery, had no flavor, needed salt... There was zero anything to it. Like it was all an afterthought. We wanted some Parmesan cheese for his pasta and tried to get the attention of our server many times... Either he would disappear... Or be too busy with other tables. By the time he got back to us my husband was already half way done with his meal, but we still asked for the cheese. It was so what this meal needed.

Entrees done and wrapped. I asked for a coffee and the husband always likes their gelato... Coconut was the gelato of the day but the server also mentioned they had some pistachio available too. So my husband asked for the pistachio. My coffee comes, and the cream I pour in quickly curdles. I had to wait forever for another coffee with fresh cream... And then my husbands gelato comes out, it was coconut. Not pistachio like asked for. The night was a true comedy of errors....

My husband and I are both in the service industry. And we know how things can get on a busy night. But from the front to the back of the house there was really no excuse for some of these errors.

Will we be back? Maybe... But probably not. Sadly."

Fried and grilled calamari were both great, pizza was outstanding, and a nice wine by the glass list upped the crowded, smallish space to tolerable, albeit quite loud (Saturday night). Crowd was festive, as the food was truly outstanding. My son and I also had their tiramisu  as final course; it was one of the better renditions of tiramisu I&#39;ve eaten.

The service was A+, top notch. Prices were really fair and proper, maybe even on the lower end of my expectations for the Chicago &#39;burbs. Small and claustrophobic dining area when full, keeps it from 5 star status, but I could easily give it a 4.5. Which I am.....

Antico Posto is located within the Oak Brook shopping center, which has a variety of stores and restaurants.  The menu items included pizza, pasta, and other Italian style entrees. I ordered cavatelli pasta with sausage and spicy arrabiata sauce.  The dish was very tasty and savory. It also had a nice presentation with shaved Parmesan cheese on top.  The two other friends I went with ordered heirloom tomato pizza and gnocchi bolognese and they both enjoyed their dishes as well. 

We tried chocolate budino for dessert and it was very rich and chocolatey.  The vanilla gelato provided a great contrast with the richness of the warm chocolate pudding cake.

Overall, it was a great lunch experience at Antico Posto!  I would definitely come back again to try something new."

Antico Posto is the 5th of 5 different &#39;Lettuce Entertain You&#39; restaurants in the Oak Brook mall area (the others being the ever-reliable Reel Club, the wonderful Wildfire, the meager Mon Ami Gabi, and massive-portions-a-plenty Maggiano&#39;s).

I had something like fifty LEY bucks to burn (thanks mom!) so with LeAnn P in tow, we came here on a lovely Saturday evening in early July.  Finding this place wasn&#39;t the easiest, as I expected it to be on the periphery of the mall like all of the other restaurants.  Eventually after aimlessly walking around for a bit {i.e. confused as sh*t}, I saw people eating pasta outside and assumed we&#39;d come to the right spot.

The hostess sat us as soon as we arrived; given the option to enjoy our dinner al fresco, we happily agreed.  Our server, Vicki, came by and took our order of &#39;vino rosso&#39;; LP got a split bottle of pinot noir and I got a split bottle of syrah for myself.  I was hoping to see Bordeaux on the wine list but my search came up empty.

Conventional bread &amp; butter isn&#39;t how Antico Posto rolls (hah!  get it?  bread....rolls?  aren&#39;t food puns the best!?)  Instead, you&#39;re given an amalgamation of olive oil, shredded parmesan, mild giardiniera, and balsamic vinegar to spread onto the warm yeasty slices.  I absolutely LOVED this option because I&#39;m the condiment king and I&#39;d never seen bread spread presented quite like this.  &#39;Twas most excellent.

Eventually we decided on entr√©es and talked for a bit until the antipasto arrived.  My cup of minestrone was all good in the neighborhood, no problems at all with that.  My lovely date wanted a small Caesar salad and when told that it only came in one size, we got reassurance from our waitress that &#34;it&#39;s pretty small&#34; and so the order was placed.

Well......it was a mammoth Caesar salad.  By that I mean it was sizable enough to be a main course.  Shocked, we looked at each other as if to say &#34;uhhh.....in what universe would this be considered &#39;small&#39;??&#34;  It became obvious that Vicki kinda sorta maybe tricked us into ordering this humongous salad that could&#39;ve easily fed 2 hungry adults.  Suffice it to say, I did not appreciate the ruse (which ultimately meant a bigger tab for our sneaky server).

I should mention though, that the laughably large salad came with a single deviled egg that was topped with capers and grated cheese.  That was a nice touch.

Our pasta arrived and both were up to standards.  Her shrimp with angel hair got the thumbs up, and my pappardelle was topped with prosciutto and asparagus.  I wasn&#39;t a big fan of how &#39;soupy&#39; mine came out, as every time one of those extra-wide noodles fell off the fork, it flopped down in the broth with the same intensity of Shamu&#39;s tail at a SeaWorld show.  #splashzone #youmaygetwet

Bread = 4
Circuses = 3.5

Thinking we&#39;d get ice cream elsewhere, we elected to pass on dessert.  The bill was reasonable (considering that we essentially got two pasta entrees and a whole bottle of red wine), but service could have been a smidge better.  Could&#39;ve done without the deceitfulness -- intentional or not -- and pasta entr√©es that weren&#39;t completely saturated in liquid.

The outdoor seating area is perfect for date night, and that complimentary bread spread is heavenly.  Otherwise, it&#39;s a fairly typical Oak Brookian Italian eatery.

So would I recommend Antico Posto?  S√¨."

We started off with some appetizers- though the complimentary bread and olive topping were delicious enough! The fried calamari, chicken meatballs, and burrata cheese were all hits. I also ordered the chopped salad for my lunch entree, which was light but filling enough.

Very simple menu that contains all the standard Italian classics and brick oven pizzas. I sorta felt like I was in a smaller version of Maggianos as the interior had the same vibe.

We started out with the grilled calamari appetizer.  It was grilled perfectly and came with some fresh arugula.  I ordered the pasta special and my wife ordered mushroom pizza. Both were good. Service was spot on. If you are looking for a good quality Italian eatery check this place out!"

Part of the reason we love coming here is the bread and giardinera although I have noticed they started salting the bread which we don&#39;t care for much.  We have had Rebecca serve us a few times and she&#39;s very friendly and attentive!  We usually come on Sundays for the Sunday sauce special which is cavatelli with a meat sauce that consists of sausage and rib meat.  It&#39;s soo good!!!  Really reminds me of our family&#39;s home made sauce.  Also I would recommend the mushroom pizza which is delicious.  Side note the turkey meat balls are just mediocre.

When I was a wee one and working my first retail job at J.Crew back in 1998, AP, was already there!  Alas, I just had my first Antico Posto (which happens to be a Lettuce Entertain You Restaurant) yesterday!

I met my friends here for lunch and the place was pretty busy for 1pm on a Thursday afternoon, which is always a good sign, other than the fact that this place has been around for at least 20 years! 

For my entree, I chose the risotto of the day which was a risotto with sweet corn served with a skewer of grilled shrimp.  My risotto was really creamy, and the sweetness of the corn enhanced the sweetness of the shrimp.  I must say the portion was a little on the small side considering it came with a $18 price tag!  Alas, it was good and I shouldn&#39;t really complain.  

My friend ordered the Chicken Meatballs which came in an Arrabiata sauce.  I had a bite of this and it was excellent.  Definitely something I will order the next time I am back at AP.  

But the highlight of the meal for us was dessert.  What I love about their approach to dessert is that they have &#34;mini&#39;s&#34; that are $1.50 each.  Italian food, though so delicious is pretty heavy an rarely do I have room for dessert afterwards.  Not this time!  And with a mini portion at such a reasonable price, how can you not try at least one?  We tried the chocolate bodino and some hazelnut mousse cake along with a small scoop of the gelato of the day: chocolate peanut butter.  Everything was amazing.  The chocolate bodino (flourless chocolate cake), which came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream was so good that we ended up ordering another :).

It was the best ending to what was already a wonderful meal."

Handmade pasta with smoked chicken was perfect and al dente which is rare for fresh pasta with just the right amount of flavor .

My fianc√© and I went and ordered a half bottle of Chianti (half bottle being the same price as two glasses) and ate the bread as an appetizer. Honestly if we went back we would do the same.

What set the meal apart was their gnocchi. They make it fresh using ricotta and flour instead of potato. This makes for a lighter gnocchi and incredible meal. We both preffered the bolognese sauce over the mushroom.

Tiramisu dessert ranks among the best we&#39;ve ever had. We will be back."

Plus I drive close to two hours just to come here. This was my first bad experience on my birthday. 

So the calamari I always order had shells in them, I literally chocking. Could have been something major, but luckily it came right out. My girlfriend also got one stuck but not as bad as me. So we called the waiter over and they replaced it and brought us new ones. The chef confirmed that they weren&#39;t cleaned throughly. 

Fast forward I get my bill, they&#39;re charging me for two calamari. I called the waiter over saying the first one shouldn&#39;t even have been on there, not only did I almost choke, I could have died from that! Plus they took the order back. So why would they even be on there. They went back and then came back and edited. Figured they&#39;d at least cover the second one for the inconvenience, but no.

The chicken on gnocchi delicati was not as they usually are. Taste wasn&#39;t there, overall this time was the worst I&#39;ve ever experienced. Not sure if there&#39;s a new incompetent chef or what is was but it ruined my birthday dinner with my family.

I don&#39;t eat meat so they were able to make something for me that was not on the menu, and the beet salad I ordered was pretty good...

My waitress was wonderful...nice but not too overbearing. She checked in on me just enough and because the bus boys kept on slamming pitchers of water next to the sill at the table I was sitting at and I kept on getting splashed left and right she took the salad off my bill.

---------------------------------------------

I&#39;m not Italian, but I have to imagine that if I were, this is what dinner at grandma&#39;s house would have been like.

The decor is perfect and comfortable. There was a short wait, but it was a Saturday evening, so that is understandable. We waited about a half hour, just enough time to have a drink at the conveniently-located bar. Smart, Antico Posto Manager. Very smart. 

We were seated in extremely comfortable, spacious booth seats. I kind of felt like Capone being given the prime booth. The server, dressed in a shirt and tie with a spiffy apron, took our drink orders and asked if we wanted appetizers. We ordered chicken meatballs and roasted beet salad. Both were amazing. Both promised deliciousness ahead. Our server returned and asked if we knew what we wanted. I ordered Spaghetti Bolognese, as did another member of our party. My wife ordered Chicken Raguso. Aaaaand that was the last time we saw our server. If it weren&#39;t for the amazing busboy (busguy? Busman?), we would have been parched. Or never would have gotten our food. 

Oddly, we then listened as our server spent a good 5-10 minutes chatting up a table of young ladies next to us, extolling the virtues of the evening specials. Specials? We were never told about specials...

The only reason this place gets the stars it did and not something much less is because the food. Was. Amazing. Our meals were perfect. And delicious. This is how Italian food should be!

Long story short, we gave a minimal 15% tip to the absentee server and handed cash to our busboy, who saved the meal. I&#39;ll be back, but I guess I&#39;ll have to wear a short skirt to be able to review the specials..."

First off, the staff was very pleasant. Our waiter was nice and one of the managers came out to meet us after our meal since it was our first time there. Also the hosts were nice and helpful.

On to the food. They brought out some bread with oil &amp; parmesan &amp; homemade giardinera peppers mixture. It was AMAZING on that bread! I actually think I ate more bread than my actual meal!

For dinner, I got the eggplant &amp; my wife got crab ravioli. Both tasted really great. To top off everything, our waiter brought us out a complementary dessert, the cake with cherries (I forgot the name of it). That was mind-blowing. Food and service combined, this place has DEFINITELY warranted a return!"

Also had the lobster pizza on special. They have a nice dough but I would have liked it cooked a bit more, the center was too soft &amp; soggy. Described as a white sauce pizza but it&#39;s actually an olive oil blend not like an Alfredo white. 

The bread &amp; oil w/ olives &amp; mild giardiniera is really nice.

We want off hours so it wasn&#39;t busy and the service was good."

I also had the three cheese ravioli and some white wine that was really delicious. Since it was my first time my sever surprised me with 4 free mini dessert options to try and those were unbelievable too!

Then we brought out of town friends there last night and we were so embarrassed with our recommendation. Look I love my Italian bread BUT they are apparently outsourcing the bread now. So it was different and that&#39;s OK, but this bread was so salty that unfortunately it ruined the whole meal!  By the way the portions keep getting smaller and I left hungry.

The location is convenient and the atmosphere inside is nice, dimly lit and romantic, yet still family friendly. I selected a red wine from their long list of available bottles and chose my pour (3 ounces, 6 ounces, or a half bottle). Of course I went with the half bottle, which came out in a nice carafe and kept me very happy and satisfied throughout my meal.

The server brought out warm bread with olive oil, balsamic, and Parmesan, along with an assortment of olives and pickled vegetables. Outstanding. 

I started with a house salad, which was perfectly chopped and seasoned with incredibly fresh spices and ingredients. All of their pastas are handmade, so I knew I needed to try. I ordered the cavetelli with roasted vegetables, which was so good. 

The service was really lovely. My server provided great recommendations and was sure to check on me multiple times throughout my meal. I was also pleasantly surprised when she offered me a dessert on the house since it was my first time at Antico Posto. And of course, it was delicious. Highly recommend and will definitely be coming back on my next trip to Oakbrook!"

I&#39;ve gotten carry-out from here, but today I came with a group of coworkers. Amongst us we got the gnocchi delecati, the risotto of the day with Italian sausage and peppers, and the caprese salad with soup. Everything was so fresh and had wonderful flavor- not one person had anything bad to say about our experience!

This was the first time I had the gnocchi from here, and it was so soft, so delicate and fresh... It compares nothing to other gnocchi that I&#39;ve had before that was chewy. The gnocchi tasted like it had some kind of cheese in with it, and was a fantastic light flavor that went perfectly with the sauce and pesto. 

Our waiter was absolutely amazing as well. I told him when we got there that we only had 40 minutes, and he respected that. We were in and out in 45 minutes, and he was attentive and polite the entire time. 

I will definitely return to Antico Posto, and I will recommend it to anyone looking for truly amazing, authentic Italian! Cheers to you!"

Inside Is a bit cramped with a small entrance bar and a tv. Not a bad spot for an after work dinner or drinks but far from romantic Italiana. 

My server was amazing names FELIPE and had it not been for him I would have given this place a 1 star. He was attentive and went out of his way to adress our dining concerns. He even grilled some jalape√±os for a nice spicy kick.

We sat on the patio but there are a LOT of little flies due to the flowers so close to the tables. (Not upset about it as it is part of eating outside on a nice summer day but it is something to consider). Starter comes with bread to dip in an interesting olive oil combination of parmesan cheese, olives, eggplant, and gardinera. 

I ordered the highly recommended shrimp diavalo. It was 4 large jumbo shrimp with marinated tomato chunks served on top of linguine pasta. Shrimp was nicely prepared but the pasta was uncooked and clumped together. Heavily lacked sauce and felt as if I was eating raw uncooked noodles for the most part. We a dressed this and Felipe exchanged it for a ravioli pasta with vodka sauce (the only thing I recommend eating here from the pasta dishes... very creamy and fresh stuffed cheese with about 8-10 pieces smothered in sauce!! )

I ordered the special pistachio white fish. Fish was prepared well but extremely bland. Came with unseasoned mashed potatoes and overcooked asparagus. By far not worth being considered a special. After a long day I was very disappointed in this meal.

The menu is fairly small and the wine list is large. Although, the many raving reviews I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll be back. I suggest dining at either the trusty Maggiano&#39;s or Tuscany which are both walking distances away!!!"

The outdoor patio is great on a breezy sunny summer day - had lunch outside a few times.  More recently came here for dinner for a birthday celebration.  The restaurant was not busy when we got there.  We were immediately served bread and olive oil - but after that, it seemed like it took forever to get our meals?  wine?  appetizers and yet the place was pretty empty...thinking 6ish on a Sunday...

We started with fried calamari (my nephews love this), raw clams and I ordered the roasted beets w/pistachios &amp; gorgonzola which was good but the citrus vinaigrette could have been more flavorful - needed more citrus for me.  For entrees - we were told the gnocchi is their specialty so I had the gnocchi w/mushrooms (brown butter - yum, sage &amp; parmesan)  this was outstanding....gnocchi was soooo light as it should be and it was so good that I let other&#39;s at my table taste my dish...very unselfish of me I know..(but secretly I didn&#39;t want to share this - it was simply divine).  

Honestly - I felt the portion size was on the smaller side and I&#39;m not just saying that because I loved eating this dish, it was just not a serving you&#39;d get at a traditional Italian restaurant where you end up bringing leftover pasta home.  But then again, I was at Antico Posto.....(serving was still too small).  they also had a braised beef shank special that both my father &amp; bro-in-law ordered and both agreed it was fantastic....and I got to snag a piece! YUM....Overall the food here is prepared very well - 4 star worthy.  Service however could have been much much better....we had to keep flagging our server for water, silverware, etc....

Prices here are pretty inline for great gnocchi and pasta dishes. Good wine selection.   I&#39;d definitely come back again - after shopping.  It&#39;s right next to the Professional building fyi."

Delicious restaurant, where have you been all my life? I wish I hadn&#39;t waited so long to give it a try.

We went out for lunch on a Sunday with a group of friends. Only one of our friends had ever been there before, and it is his favorite restaurant ever so he was very excited to be our guide for the meal. With his suggestion, the table shared the fried calamari, arugula and grains salad, and gnocchi delicati to start. Though the restaurant was quite busy, our food and drinks were brought out very promptly. Everything was amazing! For meals, my husband and I shared the chicken parm and the cheese ravioli and I loved both, though (of course) the ravioli was my favorite. The red sauce is very flavorful with a little tangy taste to it - yum! For dessert we were brought out a zuppa inglese, on the house since it was our first visit, and then we also got a chocolate peanut butter torte to share. If you love chocolate, peanut butter, and Oreos, it was heaven! The dessert portions are very large so I&#39;d definitely recommend to share, or to order the taster portions.

The restaurant is comfortable and pleasantly decorated, with plenty of room both indoors and outdoors. The patio section is small (and covered) but perfect  for nice days. Honestly, my favorite thing about this experience was the wait staff and managers of the restaurant - they all truly went out of their way to make our experience amazing.

The appetizers were bruschetta and grilled calamari.  Both were good though nothing special.  The same for my main dish, cavatelli with sausage.  The pasta was done perfectly, sauce was nice and I ended up taking half home.  After having the leftovers today I can say it was good, but nothing special.  The best part of the meal was the complex olive oil mix that comes out with the bread.  Really interesting and great flavor.  The wines were inexpensive and nice pours.

Went with some girlfriends and had the perfect round table in the corner of the place. We closed the place down, which isn&#39;t hard to do at 9:30 on a Saturday.

I am a veggie and while there are options, I&#39;m not a lover of raviolis, so I settled on the angel hair pomodoro. It was quite good, but I&#39;d consider it overpriced pasta. The rest loved their meals of ravioli and gnocchi and trendy kale salads.

But, let&#39;s be real. It&#39;s VERY important for me to tell you about dessert.

Pistachio gelato. SHUT THE FRONT DOOR. That was amazing. Like, clean that bowl with your tongue good.

Was overall very pleased with food and wine, though we felt the restaurant was loud. Would go back if in the area, but not worth a special drive. 

It took effort to talk with others at our table, which was fine, but it was nearly impossible to hear any description from the waitstaff. For example, we were really glad the specials were printed with the menu, because we couldn&#39;t hear anything when our waitress read them off quickly. Kept having to ask her to repeat things. 

The food was good. Four of the five in our party ordered a spaghetti/pasta dish and one ordered a pizza. The pizza was slightly overcooked and the pepperoni is very salty, but he was pleased none the less. One person in our party is vegan. She ordered the gluten free penne with a custom red sauce. All other pasta options have egg in them, so be careful and notify the waitstaff of any allergies. Overall, they handled her dietary restrictions very well. 

Finally, we were impressed with the wine selection and the waitstaff&#39;s ability to recommend one wine over another. The list of options is pretty overwhelming, so the restaurant expertise is much appreciated. 

Good food, but a little loud. Would go back for the wine, but food wasn&#39;t unique as far as Italian restaurants go."

It&#39;s a cute little Italian restaurant- casual, but you may want to make reservations to be safe.
The only thing I didn&#39;t like about this place was the seating arrangement. The tables are so squished together and I&#39;m not a fan of dining with my neighbors. If you can get past that- then you&#39;re fine cause food is great!
They are known for their homemade fresh pasta and wines, which you can order full/half bottle/glass, perfect way to taste and see what you like.

- Angel Hair w/ Shrimp: Tasted bleh. Mom said it tasted super fishy. Plain, needed some kind of sauce. Noodles had nothing on them.

- Grilled Chicken and Spinach fettuccine, 
creamy, but small portioned. For what I payed, you would expect a decent amount. Very good, but you get nothing.

- Fried Calamari was cold when we got it. Eh, was okay, but a little on the rubbery side. Marinara sauce was good.

- Chicken Parmesan was decent. Could be better especially for the prices. $17 that taste like $10 meal.

We had the chicken meatballs and the avocado and spinach salad for apps -- my goodness they were both so delicious.  The salad was so fresh and light and wonderful, and the meatballs were moist and covered in a flavorful spicy sauce you wanted to dip your bread into.

For entrees, Mom ordered just the calamari app -- which is grilled served on a bed of arugula and a couple slices of italian bread tossed with chili flakes.  Very well done.  I had the sausage risotto with baby mozzarella and it was outstanding.  SO full but kept nibbling because it would have been such a sin not to.

They offer a moderate upscale environment where casual attire is appropriate (even shorts and sandals.)  The food is traditional Italian cuisine executed very well.  Portion sizes are not large like most typical italian restaurants.  Quality supercedes portions, and this is good since Italian food can be overwhelming with too much pasta.

I was very pleased with food and service I have received there. I always recommend this place to other people. It&#39;s a cute restaurant and it has outside seating during the warm season. What happen today, results my rating of 1. The way the hostess treated me was outrageous. What confused me most is the reason she did it. I didn&#39;t give her any. I said hello and we need a table for two. The rest was a conversation between me and my friend, we were deciding if we want a quick bite at the bar area or to take a table. We didn&#39;t discuss it before we came and had different plans. But the discussion was just two sentences. We got the table. Hostess turned sideways to me blocking my friend from me and took her order. Then she was about to leave without asking me. My friend said make it two. Since she knew what I m eating. The hostess ignored. So when we got our waiter, he asked if we are sharing and if we would like anything else. I said we were trying to order two but I guess I pretty invisible. He didn&#39;t comment. Later they just brought us 2 desserts on the house. He waited on me before so as many others. I work in the area. He tried to fix the situation but he is not the one who needed to fix anything. I don&#39;t know what that host deal was, other than she is simple not well, however if it&#39;s the case and everyone is so nice at the restaurant to keep her there, they should let customers to know that, so no hard feelings. It&#39;s funny how after many years of going there and liking the place, I don&#39;t want to go there again. Just poof! So if you can go by the lunatic hostess, than you are ok. If I would be aware and prepare, I would be too. Since other people are very professional there.  I didn&#39;t make it a big deal right there and didn&#39;t ask for the manager. I don&#39;t want a free stuff and I don&#39;t want apologies from the people who don&#39;t need to apologize for others. All I want is a decent food and a cosy atmosphere. The choice of the hostess is going to be costly for the place since I m sure it&#39;s not her first or last mental outbreak. Too bad! I just have to find some other place."

The service was prompt and extremely friendly. The pasta is made In-house so that&#39;s what we sprang for. To say we were impressed was an understatement; the food was exceptional!

My boyfriend and I have been looking for a good Italian restaurant for awhile now.  This place was everything we were looking for.

They were accommodating in letting us choose where we would like to sit.  The colors on the walls were pleasant and comforting.  The chairs were not the most comfortable but that&#39;s my only complaint.

Bread served warm to start with delicious olive oil, giardiniera, cheese and balsamic.  We each had a dirty martini made perfectly with *easy* olive juice.  Our waitress Daniella was so nice, she allowed us to sit and talk without interrupting us to order ever 5 minutes.  We then ordered a bottle of red wine with dinner.  

Hand made pasta!  You cannot beat that quality.  I had the fettuccine w/ smoked chicken and spinach, he had the angel hair with shrimp.  This was the best pasta we&#39;ve had in over a year.  We were surprised by Claire the manager with a complimentary dessert for our first time there.  We were grateful for such accommodating service.  Wrapped up dinner with some White Russians ; )

The guy at the front door has a very bad attitude in his speech. I gave him my name and at first he didn&#39;t see my name and talked to me like I was a criminal trying to sneak in...there were plenty of seats.

As the outdoor seating is in the middle of the mall there was not much to look at besides stores and pavement.

The service is kind of slow as it took 30 minutes to get spaghetti and pizza. Spaghetti did not taste right (noodles were square and not round). Pizza was below average. Slices had too much dough and others not enough so some slices fell apart as it was overtopped. I think they were trying to do a crispy thin, but it turns out to be a pan/thin hybrid.

I wouldn&#39;t recommend coming here for the food or the atmosphere. It&#39;s a very generic place.

2 out of 5. Restaurant is clean, but food and service do not really reflect the price.

I would recommend Cooper&#39;s Hawk."

It was the best gnocchi I have had outside of Italy. I couldn&#39;t believe that we were in a mall, because you never get good food at mall restaurants, right? This is one of the best Italian restaurants in Chicagoland.

I am really big on a restaurant being clean. Antico Posto is the perfect example of a restaurant being clean. The service, from the reception to the wait staff, is great. I recommend making a reservation at least a week in advance if you are dining on a weekend. Ask about the specials. The wine list is good, and you can get smaller glasses of wine if you want to sample a few different wines throughout the meal. 

Please try this Antico Posto at least one time. You won&#39;t regret it. It really is a five star Italian restaurant. 

Two people can expect to pay $90 including tip for dinner, and that includes sharing an appetizer and dessert. If you drink more than three glasses of wine each, order two appetizers and separate desserts, expect to pay around $120 including tip for the meal. But again, it&#39;s worth it, especially if this is a special occasion."

Dad and stepmom had a chance meeting with the BF during a recent hospital stay so I had suggested lunch to make it a lot more official. This combined with the LEYE gift card I had given them for Christmas gave us the perfect excuse to check it out. 

Every table gets bread and a sort of antipasti plate. It is an olive oil base with actual olives, parmesan, definitely anchovies and some other stuff mixed in there. I didn&#39;t have any but I think I saw my dad licking that plate clean. He couldn&#39;t get enough of that! 

We started with the bruschetta. It was a nice serving of four slices and made with fresh mozzarella. Stepmom was incredibly excited over the surprise arugula in it! Dad and stepmom followed this with salads. They have some very interesting salads to pick from. Dad ended up with the spinach and avocado salad! 

NOTE: Everything is a la carte. 

BF and I both ordered types of gnocchi. I ordered a special that was baked in an Alfredo sauce. He had a tomato cream sauce. We had expected his to come in a vodka style sauce. It looked almost like a typical tomato sauce. As he mixed his plate together, you could smell the cream sauce start to come together. It was definitely unique. He enjoyed it. Mine was incredible! The gnocchi were flavorful and tender. I enjoyed every bite. 

They bring out a tray of small tastes of desserts. You can get the whole tasting tray, choices off the tray, or a single full size dessert. Dad and stepmom picked out two tastes to share. BF and I split the full size molten lava cake with vanilla gelato. It was very rich and very delicious. 

We will definitely be back. The four of us got out of there for under $50 after a $100 gift card and with apps, desserts, and a few glasses of wine."

I must note that we had some difficulty finding this place. The restaurant front is a bit small and unassuming, tucked away in a corner.  We were seated right away on a weeknight without a reservation. A lot of items on this Italian food menu looked great, but I went for the pasta. It was really well seasoned and cooked to perfection. 

The atmosphere was romantic and was perfect for a date. This was actually only the second date with my girlfriend, so I&#39;m glad we found a solid place. Back then I was actually trying to impress her a bit. ;) The service was pretty attentive. Waters were always filled, we were checked on a few times, and our check came out quickly when requested with no pressure to leave our table.

Two in our part had gnocchi.  I make my own homemade gnocchi at home, and the gnocchi at Antico Posto is fantastic.  Not heavy, or pasty, but fluffy pasta pillows.  My mom loved her 3-cheese ravioli, but wished there were one or two more.  Overall portions were fine.  Our salads were served with fresh greens, nothing that was sitting around.  

One of the kids at the table is allergic to shellfish, so the seafood risotto became beef tenderloin risotto.

This is always one of my go to places for a great lunch or dinner.  Service typically runs from good to great.  If you get Susie, it&#39;s great.  Highlights are their salads - if you can, go off the menu for the grilled shrimp chopped salad - best tasting grilled shrimp mixed in the salad (not sure why they took it off the menu) Ricotta Gnocchi is also among the best I ever had.  All pastas are freshly made.  

Orecchiette pasta was so delicious during my last visit... I always substitute their higher fat cream sauces with their Arrabiatta sauce which is awesome... Also got my calories back by adding crumbled sausage at the recommendation of our server.  A few knit picky things - server should have been quicker to check up on us as we were almost done before we got some cheese added - and they should have grated it instead of just putting a dish on the table.  Also, desserts, which are small and awesome were great, but knowing we are sharing, why not bring us small dishes instead of having us all eat off the same plate?  

And biggest pet peace is when server asks us if we want our change!  WTF.  Expect more professionalism.  I don&#39;t remember the server&#39;s name but he has a high pitched voice.... Teach him better please!!!!  Otherwise, send him to Volare where he&#39;d fit in with the rest of the loser staff over there."

The last time I was here I got one of their daily specials which was some type of stuffed ravioli. I cant remember which kind it was but I do remember liking it. If your feeling a little daring definitely give one of their specials a try. Also you get bread and olive oil at your table. Remember to ask for Parmesan and add that with some pepper to flavor up that olive oil a bit.  Overall this is a great place to eat without breaking the bank.

Started out with warm bread, served with a plate that had some oil, parm, and a little bit of antipasto (some marinated veggies, olives, etc), though the latter was spicy!

Husband and I usually get two entrees to share.  We got a ricotta gnocchi with mushrooms and then a steak sandwich.  Both were EXCELLENT.  Only issue is the gnocchi was a little too rich.  Even a half portion seemed too rich.  A half portion would be perfect as an appetizer to share between two people.  The flavors of everything were fantastic.

Because it was our first visit, they brought us a dessert sampler tray which was totally unexpected and unnecessary.  I don&#39;t really have a sweet tooth.  But I&#39;m not gonna lie, all the desserts were phenomenal!

It is super busy in here all the time so make a reservation in advance. The wine options are extensive which is key for an Italian place. 

I really enjoyed everything we ordered from the salad to the eggplant parmesan (my favorite!) The waitress was Italian and such a friendly woman! I ordered all of her recommendations and so glad I did. She told me that they make the pasta on site and I think that attributes to the quality of the pasta. Super yummy. 

Will definitely be back but the only one star I knocked off was for the parking. Its kind of a drag to park so far but hey its okay. I get to shop around after I eat so It makes up for it that I can burn some of the calories and carbs I consume while coming here :0

The place small and intimate, and I remember &#34;Check Please&#34; and/or a TV restaurant advertiser put this place on the map by giving it huge accolades. Thus, to forgo the disappointment and have to go elsewhere, phone first for a reservation. 

As for the wait staff, you can&#39;t go wrong. I&#39;ll return after 6 months, and with different diners, yet servers will stop by the table, say hello and add a comment to let me know she/he remembers me from my last visit. This time, Alexis S waited on my hubby and I. She couldn&#39;t have been any sweeter or kinder or more helpful when we couldn&#39;t decide on a salad, entr√©e, dessert. 

The grilled chicken limone is excellent. The lemon flavor is definite, but not too strong. The saut√©ed spinach is tastier than anywhere else I&#39;ve ordered it. While Brussels sprouts are the new fashionable vegetable at just about every decent restaurant, the spinach here is excellent and worth a side order with almost anything else, except maybe a pizza, which they have and they&#39;re delicious. 

What&#39;s special about dessert here is the $1 for each taste, which is enough for 2 to have a decent size bite, and if you order all 5 or 6 and/or the gelato flavor of the day, taste, it feels like you&#39;ve indulged in a delicious dessert without the huge hunk of cake, pie or whathaveyou that a lot of restaurants push.

Our friendly bartender allowed me to taste a few of the wines, and we settled on a unique Montepulciano blend.  My wife and I shared a few plates-- their take on the truffle fry is interesting-- they cut long &#34;bricks&#34; of potato and delicately cook them, presenting them like a Jenga game on the plate.  While we prefer a crispier fry, these were a fun alternative.  The highlight of the meal was the gnocchi bolognese; Antico Posto makes all of their pasta in-house, and they favor a ricotta-based gnocchi rather than a heavy potato-based which made all of the difference in the world.  Sitting atop their delicious meat sauce were pillowy, airy puffs of the best gnocchi I&#39;ve ever had.  This dish definitely soared towards the top of some of my favorites.  Great service and great experience-- we&#39;ll be back.  Until then, I&#39;ll dream of the pillowy gnocchi."

The meal was perfectly fine. I ordered the tomato and mozzarella salad for an app and it was simple, fresh but nothing special. They make the cheese themselves so I was anticipating the best cheese if my life. If the waiter hadn&#39;t told me it was hand made I wouldn&#39;t have guessed. 

For my entree I just ordered the fried calamari and Caesar salad. The calamari was excellent but the Caesar tasted funky. I added some lemon to it because usually lemon goes well with Caesar but it just made it worse.

 I ordered a glass of wine but the waiter forgot. I finally reminded him bc I didn&#39;t want it on my tab and he brought it and comped it (removed it from the bill).

I had read reviews online about a 3 platter dish involving 3 different types of ravioli/gnocchi ($15.95). I asked the server about it and he said they no longer offer it (and it was no longer on the menu) but he was willing to make me one. I decided to try the following:

Tomato Basil Gnocchi- Yum! Homemade gnocchi is really good and so was the sauce! I wish the gnocchi would better absorb the sauce though.

Mushroom Gnocchi- The sauce again was really good and so were the homemade gnocchi. The sauce, however, was very liquidy as opposed to creamy. I needed a spoon to eat this!

Three Cheese Ravioli- As this was just a taster portion, there was only 3 raviolis. The ravioli itself was pretty good- with it being homemade and all. I am not a big fan of Ricotta but if I was, this would have been amazing. The tomato sauce was really tasty!

My fiance got the following:

Sweet Potato Soup- He really liked it. He said it tasted like he was drinking a sweet potato!

Eggplant- It came in like 5 small circular slices. He said it was good! I liked it too but I don&#39;t think I would get a whole serving of it.

We got the 4 dessert sampler ($1 per sample). I had high expectations for the caramel pie because of the restaurant Beatrix... but it did not meet my expectations. It was just okay. There was a white/yellow cake which was ok. The peanut butter one was just ok (because I don&#39;t like peanut butter) but my fiance said it was his favorite. My favorite was the delicious chocolate molten cake!

The server was really nice. The place was dark/cozy. I&#39;d go back to try other things.


UPDATE: I came here again with a coworker at 11:45 and it was pretty empty before the lunch rush. Based on my previous review, I got the mushroom gnocchi... omg I had many regrets! What was the past me thinking?!!! Unless they made it different or something... it was terrible, absolutely terrible. I&#39;d give it a 1 star- it tasted just like plain gnocchi, plain mushrooms, and some liquid surrounding it. My review goes from 4 stars to 3 stars."

We went there for the first time this Saturday. The menu is extremely large, but what my wife and I ordered was very good. I had the Philly steak, and my wife absolutely loved her baked ziti. We both thought the calamari was also good. However that wasn&#39;t the best part of our experience. The hostess,  a lovely elderly lady was terrific. Sweet as can be, a true hostess. Loved her.
We will definitely be going back."

I was happy when I saw Paisan&#39;s was taking over.  I was really happy the first time I came in here and they had completely gutted what was Bombola, and made it exactly like the Paisan&#39;s in Berwyn.  The food, service, and atmosphere are exactly the same- so it&#39;s pretty cool to have that &#34;old school&#34; feeling at the Lisle location.

They are known for their pizza, but they do a lot of things really well.  Salads are pretty great here, and so are the burgers.  The burgers are huge and many of them are pretty creative.  Needless to say, the pizza is really good.

Service is always really nice and friendly.  They really do a good job of recruiting and training good people. 

We always have a  good experience here, so 4 stars it is."

As a life long Lisle resident I have seen this establishment turn from a lingerie Bar to now a beautiful family friendly trendy pizza spot! 
I am impressed by the flexibility of the space-it provides a fun bar atmosphere while at the same time a family friendly atmosphere for even the youngest family members. My 4 year old and 1 year old love the fish tank! Also, don&#39;t forget about the private dining spaces! 
Our favorite entrees are their pizza because of its sweet sauce and the ribs.

It is on a lonely stretch of Ogden Avenue and easy to bypass on your way to Naperville. However, I found it bustling with diners on an early Sunday evening. 

On my recent visit, I started by ordering a Boulevard Tank 7 and the Chicken Bombolas appetizer. Tank 7&#39;s looks are deceiving. In the glass, it resembles a Miller or some other weak beer. The head, however, is thick and the alcohol content is a whopping 8.5%. The brew went down easily and tasted mild, but it was powerful. My favorite part of the Bombolas was the pizza dough coating. The inside had a chicken meatball but no other spices, really. The meatball was tender but nothing all that amazing. The platter came with a spicy sauce that jazzed it up a bit. 

After the appetizer, I had an extra large thin crust pizza with pepperoni, onion, and black olives. The crust was a perfect balance of toasty and doughy. In addition, I liked how the ingredients, the onions especially, were crisp. The pizza sauce was a nice combination of spicy, sweet, and tangy. It was a rich red color. Overall, it was a great thin crust pizza. It held together very well; you could easily pick it up without having a topping avalanche. 

I&#39;d visit Paisans again. It had a fun atmosphere. The dining room had a very modern industrial feel and they are preparing to install a big aquarium. The one downside may be the prices. The Chicken Bombolas appetizer was almost $12 for four pieces, and the extra large thin crust pizza was about $36."

This is probably the nicest sports-bar type place you will ever visit.  A great place to watch a game or enjoy the weather on their covered patio.  

On this visit I had their nachos (usually what I order at the other location), soup and another sandwich.  The nachos are famous for the huge portion, typically for two or more to share, but I love them and planned to bring leftovers home.  

This time they were just ok...lots of chips - toppings that only covered the very top layer - underneath the toppings was just a mass of chips except for the cheese whiz sauce they put all over them, along with a sprinkle of authentic cheese on the top.   No guacamole, barely any chicken and I had to ask for another side of sour cream to give some flavor to the untouched chips on the bottom.  BIG they were - tasty, not so much. 

Everything else we had was decent so we will try Paisan&#39;s again - their pizza is always consistent and I&#39;ll probably give the nachos another try hoping this was an off night - one suggestion, get rid of the pseudo cheese sauce, it&#39;s horrible!"

I am generally not a fan of deep dish pizza (with the exception of Papa Dels down in Champaign), but this pie was amazing. It had a very cheesy topping with a sweet, flavorful sauce. We LOVED it. The crust was perfect. Most deep dish crusts are the same, boring and bland, but this one was more of a homestyle in the form of deep dish. We both enjoyed the pizza with a 20 oz Belgium Wheat from their specials. 

The place has great atmosphere, and everything on their menu sounded tasty. We will be returning."

I&#39;ll go back for sure and will try either pasta or pizza.  This is the old Pete and Johnny&#39;s on Ogden and had been under construction for some time.   

I had a spicy chicken sandwich and the bread, veggies and overall taste was good-fries in an old soup can were good-hand cut.   My son enjoyed his cheeseburger and the pizza my other son got (the meat lovers) was tasty-really good crust-crispy and not too thin.   

Why the 3-star rating?  To be honest, it&#39;s kind of expensive (no sandwich or dish under $10) but it is pretty good pizza joint/bar food and is worth a try."

It was pretty dead in there...probably more staff lingering around than people sitting down eating so if you&#39;re looking to avoid a crowd, that&#39;s a good time to go.  I&#39;ve driven by this place other times and it always looks pretty crowded.

I was looking forward to this place opening again, Pizzeria Bombola was a place I liked to go for pizza.  (the name this place was under before).  I like the change in decor in this place, pretty neat in there!  We were asked if we wanted to sit in the bar area with the high top tables or the regular dining spot to the right with regular tables.  We sat at the high tables.  They have a pretty extensive beer menu, and just menu overall...they have food besides pizza.  We ordered the chicken bombolas for an appetizer...you get for for $12.  They are basically deep fried chicken meatballs, but I might add they&#39;re good.  I wouldn&#39;t order these for a large group, but good for two to hold  you over till you get your meal.

We got a medium size thin crust pizza - it&#39;s not super thin, so I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s an option...in fact it&#39;s rather dough-y, and the sauce is sweet (odds are they add sugar) which makes this pizza a little different.  I&#39;d probably go again to try something different, but my overall first experience here was average."

The appearance is very similar to their Berwyn location, which opened a couple years ago, and has that industrial feel with steel, brick and large windows. Very modern and inviting.

As for the food, I had the Paisans Salad which has chicken, feta, red peppers, tomatoes, cucumber and olives in balsamic vinaigrette. Very fresh and good sized portion. Partner ordered the linguini arrabiata, which based on my taste was very spicy indeed and good tasting sauce (portion of that was sizable as well.)

Drink selections were ample and varied and even had several mocktail options, for those needing to abstain or be the DD.

Service was prompt and polite.

I would come back again!"

To all those harsh reviewers, I think this place deserves a break. While bad service always deserves a harsh review, comments such as &#34;sweet sauce&#34; or the way a menu item is prepared is almost unfair to critique. Paisans is known for sweet sauce, so don&#39;t knock the way a chef works. Just move on and order from another spot. 

That said! I&#39;ve been driving past this restaurant every day for what feels like a year. It&#39;s on my way to work, and is also across the street from where I used to live. I absolutely loved (and still miss) Pete and Johnny&#39;s, but was gone by the time Pizzeria Bombola opened. 

Enter: Paisans. My husband grew up in the Brookfield area and was a fan of Paisans back in the day, so I was pumped to bring him here. He warned me that it would likely be a dump, and I told him I thought he was wrong. Not surprisingly, I won. Paisans of Lisle has incredible decor. Very trendy and ridiculously industrial, it&#39;s no wonder it took so long to renovate. What was once a very open restaurant is now a spot with lots of small sections, which makes for a more intimate experience. 

After reading the reviews on service, I was skeptical. Though we had a reservation, we were asked if we wanted to sit in the bar (we didn&#39;t). We were seated in the dining room, and while we got our waters fairly quickly, it was about 20 minutes before our server was back to take any type of food or other drink order. I assumed it&#39;d be like this the entire time, or that at the very least, our order would be messed up (she didn&#39;t write anything down - I hate this) - but to my surprise, service was great from there on out, and the entire order was correct. 

Appetizers: HOLY EXPENSIVE!!!!!!!!! Clearly the appetizers are paying for all of the renovations here. $10.49 for MOZZARELLA STICKS?! We were blown away at the prices here. We originally planned to get an app, salad and pizza, but said no to salad after we saw the insane prices. We opted for the fried calamari, and it was fantastic, albeit pricy.

Pizza: I didn&#39;t taste sweet in the sauce, but my husband assured me I would have, had I compared it to another pizza. I&#39;ll admit, I wasn&#39;t overly impressed with the pizza. But you know what, that&#39;s okay. There are SO many other menu items, that there&#39;s enough for me to look forward to at the next visit!"

The regular pizza has a thicker crust than I was expecting on the southside of the suburbs, but it was still very good. Service was prompt and attentive. Appetizers are ridiculously priced though, so that&#39;s why I deducted one star. Instead of ordering an appetizer (priced at $8.95 and up), we just ordered the cheesy garlic bread, which was hands down the best garlic bread we&#39;ve both ever had. Fluffy and light and cheesy. The atmosphere of this place is interesting...very industrial feel, but also kind of feels like a chain because it&#39;s very clean and seems like a play on a biker bar. Music was pretty loud, but everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. A good family restaurant and solid food."

I give it 2 stars because there were good points. They definitely cut corners at this restaurant and service is severely lacking from all parties.
My first impression was the gooey sticky stuff on the door handle coming into the restaurant. Snot for all I know? I picked up the menu to look at the drinks and my thumb went sliding over the front cover because of the leftover food barely crusting on the top. Dirty and gross! Also, the bathroom was unclean and disguisting.
This was a couple&#39;s night out and the waitress (Michelle?) kept spending too much time talking and hanging around our table. At one point during the visit, she had actually sat down in one of our friend&#39;s chair while he took a phone call and said she needs a beer and suggested I give her mine since I&#39;m &#34;taking a long time to drink it.&#34; When he came back she did not get up so he grabbed another chair from the table across from us to sit at our table.
They have a nice beer selection and tall ones. The $11 weed cocktail (basically almost like a long island) was very good from what Im told. I asked for 2 samples and she brought out 1 sample which she took away before I was done sampling the new beer and 1 full sized drink of the other sample I wanted to try. We had asked her 2 different times about the name of the beer she gave us and who made it. By the second time we clearly understood that she was not going to be attentive to our needs.
The food was okay definitely not fresh. The waitress admitted that some of the food is premade/fried and kept under the light and they heat it up when it is ordered. The burger came with onion strings on it which was asked to be placed on the side; it was not. She took the burger back and it was taken off and both the burger and onion strings which was being &#34;remade&#34; came back within 1 min. The onion strings came back on a separate plate with cheese and sauce still all over it. We complained and she brought us a hot plate with cold onion strings on it. The waitress said these are prefried and sit under the hot light. Otherwise the salads  (full size is family size) and the burger was tasty. It was a bit pricey. $13 for a burger. I had a lasagna which is the typical premade with no fancy ingredients or freshly made seasoned sauce. I wouldn&#39;t order it again. 
The manager gave us a choice of a round of beers, dessert or 10% off of our bill for the trouble we had. We choose 10% off since we weren&#39;t staying much longer. We had paid and left tip and sitting there chatting while we finished our drinks when the busser came out with the mop and bucket (20 min til close) and closed one of the 2 doors. He told us that we could only go out the one door. It became a safety hazard very quickly which the manager did not seem to get. When we had finally gotten out of that back room, which was a hassle due to the lack of room to walk due to the objects in the way,  we were shocked by how wet the rest of the dining room floor was making it very dangerous to walk through (esp wearing high heels). The manager only seemed to care about reprimanding her staff and she started walking away when my friend was still talking. Ok bye manager good listening skills!
Side note: beer tastes like floor cleaner when someone is mopping near and under you."

Pizza was so over cooked that the crust pieces were hard as a rock. Seriously I&#39;ve had better frozen pizza.

Beer was over priced.

I was intrigued by the construction material used and the design and layout is very unique. So much to take in with just one visit... same goes for their menu.

Stopping in opening day was enjoyable and my decision on #nationalpizzaday will surprise you. I was tempted by their salad &#34;The Julie&#34;, but went with Nonna&#39;s Lasagna instead. Anytime grandma&#39;s recipe is on the menu you have to try it. It was delicious and the hint of spinach was perfect.

The burgers served on cutting boards looked insane, as they went wafting by. I wasn&#39;t going to give a review until I tried their pizza, but just wanted to chime in on my pleasant experience on day 1. There really is something for everyone on their extensive menu and great bar drinks too. Oh, did I meantion friendly staff?

I look forward to spring when the garage doors are raised and the fresh air will flow through the building. Welcome to the neighborhood!

Our younger son accidentally exploded a bag of oyster crackers, when trying to open it, all over the table, floor an all of us. Then about 10 seconds later one of the staff casually walks by without a word and dropped another bag at the table right by my son. Totally awesome!!

The first time I came here the food and service were great and it seemed like a new go to place.  I&#39;m starting to think that the first time I came here was the exception to the rule and not the norm.  Each time I&#39;ve gone the service has gotten worse each time, but the food is still really good.  I&#39;ve had a different server each time and other than the first time, it&#39;s always hit or miss and usually very slow.  On Friday and Saturday nights they have valet parking, I hate valet parking, the only thing more annoying are those stupid bathroom attendants (they don&#39;t have those).  Tuesday night was was the final straw for service. We ordered our food and when it came out, one of my friends got the wrong pizza.  I understand mistakes happen, the waitress was very apologetic and I could tell she felt awful about it.  She brought the manager over and the manager let us know that they were remaking her pizza.  Then the manager said if we wanted the incorrect pizza we could buy it, otherwise she was going to let the kitchen staff eat it.  She never offered to discount the pizza or offer a free drink while my friend had to sit there while the rest of us ate.   About 30 minutes later, after the rest of us had finished eating and had our plates cleared and were essentially ready to go home, her pizza showed up.  The bill had no discount on the pizza for the long wait or the inconvenience, nothing.  While they do have great food, there are plenty of other great places in the area to get food and that have great service.  I suggest trying one of those instead."

We were SORELY disappointed. While Ambiance was good, typical Chicago style Italian place, nothing over the top, pseudo trendy decor. 

First Issue: Unorganized - Made a reservation for 8 people, arrived and had to wait for them to put a table together for us. The place was not busy at all. maybe 4 tables filled (albeit larger group 4-6 people each).

Second Issue: Waitress kept disappearing. We were seated and got drinks but then did not see our waitress again for nearly 20 mins. There were maybe 30 people in the entire place with 7 members of the waitstaff but some how she kept disappearing. Every time I went looking for her (Yes I had to look for her, three times) I found her either hiding in the kitchen or clustered in a group by the register with the other waitstaff chatting. maybe it was because we were a party of 8 so she knew a tip was included and did not have to work for it. 

Third Issue: Timeliness (or lack there of) - Food came out in three separate waves and the food was luke warm like it had been sitting in a window somewhere. By the time I got to eat (after the third wave and everyone go their food) my food was cold. It took nearly 75 minutes for us to finally get all food. We did not order any appetizers and as I have mentioned the place was less than a third full. My colleague ordered a side salad with her sandwich and instead received Garlic Parm Chips

As for the food:
I ordered the Chicken Vesuvio and for $19 (with Vesuvio potatoes) I would rather have had a chicken nuggets from McDonald&#39;s and went back home with $15. I was not impressed at all. 

Three colleagues had Salads which they thought were good. (Turkey Cobb, Kung Fu &amp; one other)  

Two colleagues had the crispy chicken sandwich and were underwhelmed. 

One colleague has the Beef Panini and liked that. 

Garlic Parmesan chips were a tasty treat. 

We gave ourselves and hour and a half to have a leisure lunch only to be rushed because of the delay in getting the food.

Bottomline - I may give them one more shot because they are close to work,  but I will wait until they have the stuff worked out. There is no way with the amount of diners in that restaurant and the size of the kitchen staff  on site it should have taken so long to get feed let alone eat cold food. I have chosen not to call out the individual waitress as she seemed to have lacked training so I think it is systemic."

We moved out here over 4 yrs ago and have not yet found a great pizza place until now!!!  

Ordered a larger 1/2 sausage 1/2 pepperoni. Delicious!! Just like the one they make in Cicero!! LOVE PAISANS. 
The service was great. Very friendly!!

I will be going there once a week now that it is so close!

Have been going to PAISANS for more than 20yrs. Best pizza!!"

Went there on a Sunday afternoon. Nice crowd for lunch. We sat at the bar and were greeted promptly. We were looking for a light lunch so each ordered soup and half salad. The soup was creamy chicken pesto....excellent! Not too thick and creamy and a great flavor. We were quite surprise with the salads....1/2 salad for $7 was huge.I ate half, only because I was full! I got the BBQ chicken salad and my boyfriend got the Turkey Cobb salad. We were both amazed at the wonderful flavors and high quality ingredients. 

We will are excited to stop back in and try some of the other items on the menu.
Stop in...you won&#39;t be disappointed."

Interior is pretty cool, industrial vibe, nice outdoor seating with the garage doors for summer. House salad w chicken and feta was excellent. Pizza was average at best. Crust was kinda just ok.

Actually our whole table of Chicago pizza snobs agreed that none of us would make a trip back here on our own to eat.  Might be a fun place in the summer to have drinks though."

First issue: waitress was kind enough to bring my order to me when it was ready but didn&#39;t give me any plastic silverware or napkins. Maybe I&#39;m supposed to get them somewhere else though. I don&#39;t know. 

Second issue: a calzone (in my book at least) is not supposed to have the sauce on the inside of the calzone. It is supposed to be served on the side. 

Third: wasn&#39;t a big fan of the sauce or the sausage. 

I&#39;m sure issue 1 was either my fault or just an oversight on the employees part. Wasn&#39;t a show stopper. I&#39;ll be sure to ask for the sauce in the side next time so issue #2 is solved. Not sure I can do anything for item 3. Hopefully the sauce will be better next time i go or it will most likely be my last time. 

Will update the next time I go in."

Atmosphere: Cool, casual, eclectic with lots of games on the t.v.s in the bar area (high tops)

Unfortunately, as good as the food and setting are, the service has been really awful on several occasions.  We have frequented Paisans since the day after it opened after anxiously awaiting its opening (during the long construction).  We had one terrible experience with the server, wait time for food, and manager, but REALLY wanted to love this place...so we&#39;ve continued to give it a try and hoped they would work the kinks out through time.   We have probably been here 10 times since it opened.  8 of the 10 times the service has been &#34;ok&#34; - it&#39;s never been fabulous and the servers always seem to balk on knowing the tap beers, etc.  We have now experienced our 2nd time with a 45+ minute wait for our food, while watching other tables who arrived and were seated after we ordered receive their food.  The male manager on both occasions has acted somewhat uncaring, and acted as though it was a bit of a bother to talk with us. Tonight we heard &#34;sometimes orders just jump in front of others&#34; and &#34;we just had a lot of big tables&#34; and &#34;we had a lot of carry out orders&#34;.  Of course, a free dessert was offered, but we had already waited so long, that wasn&#39;t appealing.  It would have gone a long way if the server or manager just said &#34;sorry - we really messed up on this one; what can we do to make it better&#34;.  Bottom line....don&#39;t go here if you would like to eat within a reasonable amount of time or if you&#39;re hungry!!! If you have a free afternoon, want to watch games, and don&#39;t care much about when your food arrives, go for it!"

We really like the place, and have had a variety of food - from the flatbreads to full dinners, and some casual sandwiches.  Things are usually fast enough, but when it&#39;s crowded, it can take awhile for drinks from the bar service.
The only issue is - parking - sometimes they have valet, and sometimes they don&#39;t - and not enough parking places in the small lot on the busy nights."

Customer service is NOT a priority. On weekends there is mandatory valet parking. We went on a Tuesday night to hang out with friends pre-Christmas. Our waitress was super slow. She had no idea what beers were on tap. When pressed about the craft beer selection, she gave vague descriptions of the beer type, apparently having no idea what their names were. I ordered a pizza with 3 ingredients. The pizza brought to me had 3 ingredients, but only 2 matched what I&#39;d actually ordered. The waitress was a no show in re-checking on us so we had to ask another server to find her and send her back over. One of my friends observed her just standing by the computer, not doing anything. But she still didn&#39;t come over. When she finally did, I apprised her of the situation with my food and asked to have it corrected. Some time later, she came back with another person (not sure if the second lady was a manager or what as she didn&#39;t say). They offered to let me PAY for the mistake pizza, or they would just give it to the kitchen staff. I told them to keep it as I wasn&#39;t interested in paying for something I didn&#39;t want. Eventually, after my friends were long finished with their own meals, I finally got my pizza. I quickly ate some and boxed the rest to take home. When we got the bill, we noticed NOTHING was done to rectify the situation regarding my dinner. They charged me full price after all that hassle. I certainly have no desire to hurry back to an establishment that treats people more like cattle than appreciated guests."

One person in our party of seven swears he made reservations for that evening but when we checked in we were told it was foe Sunday. No problem, they found us a table with no wait. Our server was fantastic. Friendly, patient, and checked on us throughout. We had pizza, burgers, ribs and flatbread. Also some apps that I forgot. Food coming out was a little slow but was timed well between appetizers and beverages. Pizza was pretty good. Sauce a bit sweet as other reviewers have noted. My 13 year old said the ribs were fantastic and he wants to try pulled pork next time. Prices are a little high. This won&#39;t be a weekly stop. The decor is interesting, a lot of the walls are garage doors and could be pretty neat during warmer months. We loved Bombola when it was here and I think we will grow to like this just as much."

It&#39;s a nice touch! The decor of the restaurant is modern. Very cool rope lights, shinny silver metal plating, bricks and garage doors that will roll up on the summer and spring months. Kids have separate menu choices which was nice. Lots of families present. Casual dress is perfect. We ordered the nachos and they were huge and very good. You can taste the wood oven smoke in the chips, well done. We ordered a meatlovers pizza and veggie primavera. Both were good. The pizza does have a sweet taste to the sauce for sure. Not bad. Just a little different which was fine. The meat on the pizza was plentiful. Highly recommend and would go back a second time as the menu was quite large."

I am hoping I caught them on a bad day, it&#39;s Wednesday about 3pm CST. The portions are relatively small considering other places within driving distance.

i also had a house margarita, while I waited for the togo order, and it was okay. Nothing to write home about. 

It does give the sense of taste to be completely rushed and just over priced for what was received.

would I try again? yes, everyone has a bad day especially for the reviews received. I was excited to try a new place unfortunately it just didn&#39;t pan out this round.

The food and drinks were very good from the homemade chips and salsa. to the flan for dessert. My better half and I both ordered my favorite, Chile Rellenos.  The Poblano peppers were good stuffed with chihuahua cheese. Everything arrived hot and ready to eat.  

I am a Tequila snob, and I regret not adding a buck to my Margarita choice for Patron.  I picked a rita combo with Grand Marnier, and it was just a little off.  No complaint...probably my selection.  I am curious enough to find out on my next visit and I better find out they use fresh sqeezed lime...just sayin.  

Service and hospitality abound from a smiling owner who greets you and his better half who says hello before you leave.  Muy Bueno!

The establishment is clean. The staff is super-friendly and know the menu well.  Isn&#39;t it annoying when a server replies they have never tried something on the menu? Give me a break. Not at Delicia! In particular Elia is a very pleasant, knowledgeable, and attentive waitress. We&#39;ve had several different entrees and have loved every option! Dining with a group? Highly recommend the Parrillada Delicia Con Langostinos.  A delicious mix of marinated skirt steak, fresh water large shrimp, grilled chicken, fresh rib tips, chorizo, pork chop, cactus, grilled green onions and jalape√±os, and Oaxaca cheese served in a cool hot pot so it stays warm throughout your dining experience. Served with rice, beans, and warm tortillas. If your feeling like a satisfactory Mexican food meal, do your tastebuds a favor, don&#39;t go anywhere else."

Overall:
-The prices still haven&#39;t decreased. I know someone said they were supposed to - but that was a bunch of BS...nothing has changed in six months.
-Our orders came correctly this time - but there wasn&#39;t anything to write home about. While I ordered literally the same thing, the chimichangas were more fried tortilla than fillings, and the dry rice (presumably from a can) did nothing for me (or hubby - who loves Mexican rice).
-The service was MUCH much better this time - but not enough to bring me back to eat this food.

There are far better Mexican food choices in the area. I can see how Delicia may be good for a happy hour of margaritas and guac, but go elsewhere for dinner - take a hike to Rito&#39;s, or give Burrito Parilla a try."

This place is on in a strip mall after 119th street on RT 59. Ample seating with a separate bar area. Service is a bit slow but this maybe because of a weekday. The complimentary chips are nice and seemed made fresh on site. Plenty of food options on the menu. Tried the tilapia fish and pollo al Mexican .

We ordered the enchilada special as well as the steak fajitas and everything was EXCELLENT.  Steak had a great grilled flavor and the enchiladas with mole sauce were outstanding.

We had the chile relleno and carnitas burrito.

Both were good and you can add to them if you like. I added avocado to my burrito. The black beans were seasoned well. If I could change one thing I&#39;d request less oily tortilla chips. I liked the upbeat atmosphere and it was a perfect way to kick off the weekend!"

He refused to accept our Groupon for carryout, even though nowhere on it did it say not valid for carryout.

They provided sternos to keep everything hot and the metal stands to use. It was so easy and everything was delicious! My parents plan on using them this summer.

While this may not seem like a huge deal for many, I&#39;m a vegetarian and something as small as extra cheese can make a dish.  To me, the dish is to be  full of cheese, smothered w/sauce &amp; more cheese. This was your normal run of the mill chili rellanos you get at any good mexican restaurant.

Went to Delicia yesterday with the family, and everyone enjoyed their meals (always a difficult task). Ambiance was great, we were seated right away and staff was very attentive and friendly whenever we needed anything.

First off, the chips were super fresh (warm and crispy), never realized what I was missing until I sat down and started munching on these!  Came with Salsa, and we ordered some guacamole, which was definitely house made and tasted great. 

I had the Burrito de Picadillo (ground beef mixed with tomatoes and other ingredients), which is pretty hard to find normally, and was super tasty.  Was kinda jealous of the people who got the fajitas, that sizzle and smell had me wising i ordered it, and they definitely were raving about it, but I stand strong on my burrito decision!

Most importantly, they make a great Margarita! (had the Cadillac Margarita, and would highly recommend it)  Will definitely be back!"

I have eaten here 4 times. Most of the dishes are very standard.

I&#39;d like to see them get a little &#39;fresher&#34; with the sides.
The refried beans, rice, and letttuce/cubed tomato combo that is the SAME at EVERY B grade mexican restaraunt.   why not elevate it a little...............Make your own beans instead of glopping them from a can. why not use a green romaine or bibb lettuce instead of iceberg. Why not use heirloom tomato cubes instead of the grocery store hard as rock pink ones.

Their churrizo burrio was, and I mean this literally, dripping in grease out of the ends. It lacked imagination. Service was slow. I ordered a quart of salsa to go and a small bag of tortilla chips and it was $13 bucks. OUCH.  I will say that their salsa is extremely flavorful and delicious. (See? Im not just a complainer.....credit is definately due)

They have this completely nailed and it should please just about everyone. The tortilla chips are flour ones and made there. But they need to blot them with a paper towel.........mine were also dripping in frying oil.

This place doesn&#39;t offer any &#34;oooh&#34; factor that makes it interesting. Its rather generic. As I like to do, in fairness,  is to  compare it to one that a restarauntuer can aspire to:  visit &#34;A Toda Madre&#34;  in Glen Ellyn.  I&#39;d like to see some personal pride and passion put into the menu. I don&#39;t feel it here after 4 visits.

Id rather go to buchos and spend half of what I did here."

I am really excited to have found this place near my future home.  I was a bit sad not having an authentic Mexican restaurant nearby, after growing up in an area where you are around authentic Mexican restaurants at every corner, and would just have to subject myself to cooking it all the time-always tastes better when someone else cooks!  I was hoping that this place would just satisfy my appetite, well it did more than that!  It was great!  From the Margaritas to the Parrillada con Langostinos!  The quality of the meat and the condiments used to compliment the food are right on point.  The chips are SO addicting!  No wonder they charge for the second basket, as someone pointed out in another review.  It&#39;s about business as well, nothing personal.  I would had pause for 5 more baskets but then I wouldn&#39;t had enjoyed my margaritas and meal.  

The service was just as great.  No complaints here whatsoever.  The owner made us feel welcomed and told us about their events and their weekly Friday night salsa dancing.  I will definitly be back for dancing.  My boyfriend and I both look forward to making Delicias our new place for Mexican food."

I have my doubts if I ever had a better Mexican food than this place. The service is outstanding...attentive and ever smiling waiters. I can see a lot of positive changes under the new management...the owner is always present and very flexible. Will always advice if we over order and that is something i loved in him. Forgot to ask his name.....I call him Mr. Always Smiling...lol. 
I wont be looking at any other Mexican place...this is it.

The chips and salsa are just right.  The margaritas are tasty and the beer is served at the correct temperature along with a frosted glass.  The Queso Fundido with chorizo on freshly made flour tortillas is consistently outstanding.  We&#39;ve tried a number of different entrees and all have exceeded expectations.  We&#39;ve not tried any of the desserts simply because we didn&#39;t have any room left to eat anything else. 

Each time we have visited we have been greeted promptly and warmly, and seated right away.  Our drink and appetizer orders were taken immediately, and chips and salsa were delivered directly, warm and crisp for the chips, just the right amount of chiles and spice in the salsa.  Our service has been competent, friendly and attentive without any sense of hovering.  The owner is also generally involved, stopping at most of the tables with sincere interest in the diner&#39;s experience without being intrusive or overbearing.  One tip on ordering: order drinks and appetizers separately from the entrees as the kitchen is very efficient; they aren&#39;t trying to rush anyone, but by ordering separately the diner can control the pace of the meal without worrying about a slow kitchen response.

As other reviewers have mentioned, we found the restaurant to be warm and inviting without being overdone.  It is very clean and bright with good sound levels offering easy and enjoyable conversation levels."

My mother and I had lunch here today and we absolutely loved it. It is much better than most of the mexican restaurants around plainfield that&#39;s for sure! They are a little on the pricy side for mexican food ($10-$15 per plate on average), but since we were there for lunch they had some specials going on.

 I had two tacos (chorizo and steak) with rice and beans for $7.99 and my mom had the nacho supreme for $8.99. It was all absolutely &#34;delicia&#34; and the portion sizes were huge. The tacos were loaded up with meat, onion, and cilantro. By the time I finished them I couldn&#39;t even finish the rice and beans. The nachos were also amazing, but not your typical nacho supreme. Each nacho chip is huge and is individually topped with meat, cheese, corn, and tomato. The plate also comes with guacamole, sour cream, lettuce and salsa. 

The service was also outstanding. We let them know we were on a time crunch and they had us in and out of there in 30 minutes. I will be back no doubt. Absolutely one of the best mexican restaurants in the area."

It&#39;s the Americanized version, and it does a damn fine job of being that. Their food is better than ChiChis (RIP) ever was, it&#39;s better than Don Pablo&#39;s, it&#39;s better than Chili&#39;s. But, it&#39;s priced similarly to all of them. If you want the dine-in Mexican experience in the north end of the &#39;field, you can&#39;t do better than this. We&#39;ve been several times and have had good, attentive service every time we&#39;ve been. 

Now, more specifics: The vibe is like a standard nice suburban sit-down Mexican restaurant. Good margaritas, my husband is hooked on their chimichangas, my kid loves the quesadilla and I&#39;m content to bounce around to whatever looks good that night. Their prices seem in line with what other Mexican restaurants charge. They have a bar area that has standard seating where you can watch sports if you like. Their wait staff knows the whole menu, so if you are stumped, they&#39;re happy to help. And they don&#39;t just offer what they like, or the most expensive item on the menu, they ask you questions about your general preferences and make an assessment. And everyone I&#39;ve encountered there has been super nice. While I was pregnant and missing the hooch, they even made me a virgin mango margarita. That gets you saint status in my book."

We&#39;ve been waiting for a high quality, authentic Mexican restaurant in our area for years.  Finally Delicia has come along to give us our fix!

Firstly, the free chips and salsa are amazing and both made in house (as is all the food, apparently). Some of the best salsa I&#39;ve ever had (and I&#39;m a regular taqueria goer on my frequent travel to Texas, New Mexico, and Southern California).

We go here for lunch and dinner as often as we can, and have been here 9 or 10 times so far since discovering the place, and we haven&#39;t been disappointed once.  The carnitas (pork) and al pastor (marinated pork) tacos are really, really good. The standard beef tacos and tostadas are fresh and delicious. But the enchiladas with mole sauce are INSANE!

This place is a gem and a rare find in the far western suburbs: a totally authentic Mexican restaurant that serves amazing dishes and uses super-fresh ingredients.

One last comment re: the other negative reviews. My first and second visits were for take out to try the food right after they had opened, and it did look like they were struggling a bit with pulling their act together.  But they have, and wow is it good now."

10 minutes into our visit we still didn&#39;t have chips or drinks. Slow service throughout the meal but the server (Vanessa) was very nice. 

The food was good. Hubby had chiles rellenos and I had steak fajitas. The salsa was yummy. 

The owner was wandering around scolding the staff. It was very off-putting to to watch. I felt bad for them.

My first time here so I got the basics to see if it&#39;s worth visiting again. Got some steak and tacos al pastor. The al pastor tacos could have been a little more cooked to crisp it up a bit as they were a little too juicy for my preference but overall tasted ok. The steak tacos were decent and the quality of steak was better than most joints in the neighborhood. Both came with the traditional cilantro and onion toppings which in my opinion is all you need. Not the best tacos but not the worst either, at $3 a taco I would say they are over priced as most places are on par of not better with tacos between $2.25-$2.50 a taco. Also got an order of ground beef nachos which appear to be an attempt at some kinda fancy nacho platter. Again the quality of the ground beef was its saving grace but for $9 it was way over priced for an appetizer which for that price should have been an entree itself. Also got an order of fries and chicken fingers for the kids which kinda was the highlight of the entire order which came with seasoned fries and 2 chicken fingers. Overall I would rate this a 6/10"

Trust the one and two star reviews more.  Went there with our family of 5 and was not impressed in the least.  

Food: Sub-par mexican.  My wife got the Chile Rellenos and she said you could taste the fryer grease.  We both had tamales that absolutely fell apart when you unwrapped them.  Kids got the quesadillas that weren&#39;t even made with authentic chihuahua cheese - just some jack cheese with frozen vegetables inside.  Food was not fresh - although they attempted to make it &#39;seem&#39; fresh by tossing in one or two fresh avocados or tomatoes in a dish.  Salsa was sweetened and tasted canned.  Guacamole tasted like it came out of the freezer, although they tried to present it in a stone bowl like they had just made it.  Not fooling anyone.

Service:  Server was very inattentive.  Drinks were never refilled, never asked us if we needed more chips.  He spent more time standing at the bar than serving us.  

All in all, we won&#39;t be returning.  Never thought Pepe&#39;s would be more authentic than another Mexican restaurant, but that is the case here.  Don&#39;t waste your time, your money, or your good health."

Chips and salsa came out with the drinks. Salsa was ok. 

I got the steak burrito ($10) with added guacamole inside, which they charged me an extra $3.50 for and the amount in the burrito was sparse. The burrito was not bad, at least it came out hot, but definitely not worth trying again; it was just plain and flavorless. lack of salsas was also a letdown as the burrito had little flavor itself.  

My standard for Mexican food in the area is pretty high when compared to my favorite, Tortilla Flatz or El Burrito Loco for late night drunk food. 

Go for the margaritas, pass on the food."

We (hubby, 2yo, 4yo) went for lunch on a Saturday afternoon a couple weeks ago and were the only patrons in the restaurant.  There was no staff up front to seat us but they showed up within a couple minutes of us entering.  

Once seated the waiter came and took our drink order, came back several minutes later with drinks then asked if we were ready to order.  Chips and salsa were only brought out after requested.  It took more than 30 minutes for our food to arrive and it was stone cold by the time we received it.  It might have been ok had it been closer to warm upon arrival, but we won&#39;t be going back for a second run.

From what little we did taste, the salsa was ok but nothing remarkable.  The verde enchiladas were eh.  Whatever my husband had went virtually untouched- which is saying something because he will basically eat anything.  One better- his food was so noteworthy neither of us remember what he ordered.  The kids wouldn&#39;t even eat their basic cheese quesadilla.  Waiter didn&#39;t come back except to offer to-go boxes and the check. 

Should be a clue to the staff when the plates on the table are full, basically untouched, and to-go boxes are declined.  

Cold food, poor service, high-ish prices....just not worth it."

I was really hoping for authentic Mexican cuisine, since it&#39;s pretty tough to come by.  The overall food experience was pretty disappointing.  The menu seemed fairly limited and was neither really tasty &#34;Mexican fast food&#34; nor high end authentic Mexian food.  I guess it was a bit more Tex-Mex, but not really.

I went with the &#34;torta sandwich,&#34; which if it has the word sandwich in it, you know it&#39;s not going to be great.  It comes with french fries and mayonaisse on the sandwich!  I substitued the mayo for sour cream and kept the fries just for fun.  My wife order the chicken enchiladas.  The torta was pretty terrible.  Absolutely no flavor on the meat.  Even the rice and beans were very flavorless.  I never add salt to food, but this forced me to.  As I kept eating, I wondered how fresh the food was, or if it had been prepared for hours and just added to whatever a customer would order.  The &#34;carne asada&#34; on the torta was on the fattier side and somewhat tough.  Even the fries tasted like they were frozen before being served.  

My wife kind of enjoyed her enchiladas.  It was nothing to rave about, but she&#39;s pretty low maintenance.  

Dessert featured flan and tres leches cake.  Both were above average, but I doubt they were made at the restaurant.  We didn&#39;t have any drinks, so I can&#39;t comment on that.  Service was ok.  I did share some feedback with the manager.  

Overall, not good and we won&#39;t go back.  

If you&#39;re looking for some really good Mexican food, try Don Rafas Carnitas in Joliet, La Quebrada in Aurora, and Los Comales in Aurora.  All of these places have original Chicago locations and are top notch!  If you&#39;re looking for fancier, gourmet Mexican, Bien Trucha and A Toda Madre in Geneva are phenomenal!!"

I guess it might as well be new though, because the web site has &#34;new owner!&#34; splashed all over it. Anyway, my parents, grandmother and I went for a somewhat early dinner here last week. 

I don&#39;t know if the new guy changed anything other than the menu, because the place looks very dated and dark. There was only one other full table when we arrived but our waitress seemed harried and scattered. Our salads arrived quickly, along with some soda-type bread, but then it was a loooooong wait to the entrees. While more people arrived in the meantime, the place wasn&#39;t remotely full. (Please note, you WILL taste the creamy garlic dressing the next morning even after brushing your teeth multiple times. Just saying...)

Dad and I had ribs, and I will say these were generous portions, if not the greatest ribs I ever had (I didn&#39;t love the supposedly &#34;all new&#34; bbq sauce...maybe they should have kept the old one?) Ribs came with very skinny fries, which got cold rather quickly. 

Mom and Grandma both had crab cakes with a sweet champagne sauce and seemed to enjoy. 

Regarding atmosphere: I was the youngest person in the place by 25 years, the next being my mother. This is the God&#39;s waiting room set dining here apparently.

Overall, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d come back. Despite a few intriguing things on the menu, the inexplicable wait was rather off-putting, and the place needs a face-lift to go with its new menu."

It&#39;s 8:03, and we ordered our entrees 40 minutes ago. But let me start from the beginning.

My mother-in-law decided to start a tradition for 2015 for the three of us to go out to dinner once a month (her treat), trying new places that none of us had ever been to. Excited by the idea, we settled on Walker&#39;s to kick off this tradition.

When we first arrived (6:30 p.m.), we were warmly greeted and were told it would be a 15 minute wait. We said that would be fine and were told we could wait at the bar. So we did, and ordered a round of drinks while we waited. I got my usual beer and the MIL and M both got Moscow Mules. 

Walker&#39;s, like someone else said, has that Wisconsin supper club feel to it and I definitely agree. The atmosphere was cozy though, and the dimmed lights gave off an intimate dining feeling. But the boisterous crowd at the bar made it anything but. The interior itself could use some updating but overall it wasn&#39;t too bad.

When our table was ready, some guy escorted us to it (owner? manager?) Really nice guy; very personable and friendly. 

It was all downhill after that. Our table was to the right of the bar near the hallway that lead to the bathrooms and such, so it was hard to enjoy the experience with slightly drunk patrons standing about and the waitstaff running back and forth in front of our table. Once seated our waitress didn&#39;t  appear for over five minutes. When she finally did, she didn&#39;t introduce herself but was quick to name the soups of the day. Before she scurried off we placed our appetizer order  (calamari and spinach artichoke dip). 

The food arrived rather quickly and was delicious. The spin-dip was piping hot (blistering the roof of my mouth) but was perfectly melted and flavorful. The calamari was pretty good, though some pieces were rubbery and almost naked from the breading falling off. When the waitress returned, we placed our orders: filets for my husband and his mom, Chicken Caprese for me. I wasn&#39;t in the mood for steak, as I&#39;ve been under the weather and had zero appetite. I thought chicken would be a safe bet, as I can tolerate reheated chicken better than steak if there were leftovers. 

So we finished our apps and waited. And waited. And...... waited. Glancing at my phone, I saw that thirty minutes had gone by. While the restaurant had a good number of people dining in, I don&#39;t think it was at full capacity. How long do two steaks (medium) and a chicken entree take? Our waitress was MIA at this point and I&#39;m sure we looked pitiful with empty drink glasses, spent appetizer plates, half full water glasses scattered about our table and with looks of boredom/confusion on our faces.

8:15 p.m.; our entrees still hadn&#39;t  arrived. Our waitress came by ten minutes prior, assuring us that she had checked on our order and &#34;it should be out shortly.&#34; She said she&#39;d bring out a basket of bread for us while we were waiting. That basket of bread never came. At this point, we were frustrated and hungry. 

Our food finally arrived at 8:20 p.m. M and his mother loved  their steaks, however the Chicken Caprese wasn&#39;t great.  I wasn&#39;t given a knife to cut the chicken with and it was too tough to separate with only a fork. Luckily, my unused bread knife came to the rescue and I was able to sample my entree. The chicken was overcooked as I had predicted due to the long wait, and despite being smothered with fresh mozzarella, tomato, and balsamic, it was bland and forgettable. Disappointed, I ate my rice and vegetable sides but that was it. 

The owner/manager came over and apologized for the delay in our meals and offered me something else, but at this point I just wanted to get out of that place. When our bill came, we were disappointed to see that despite a lousy dining experience and my uneaten entree, the total didn&#39;t reflect any sort of comps or discount. Not that we expected anything huge but come on! Since I didn&#39;t take the owner/manager&#39;s offer for a different entree, at least knock off a round of drinks or something. I spent over two hours here, eating nothing but rice pilaf and some veggies (and a bit of calamari and spin-dip). 

So we paid and left. It was 8:50 p.m. I am a patient person when it comes to dining out, but everyone reaches their breaking point. I feel that a dining experience almost two and a half hours long from start to finish would be acceptable at a higher-end establishment, but not here. Yes, it was a Friday night but management should have anticipated that and made sure adequate waitstaff was available. I don&#39;t know what the issue was last night, but as a first-time diner, I was very disappointed. 

Long story short- friendly employees, decent food, lousy service. M and his mother said they&#39;d give it another go, but I have no desire to."

Plan to eat Sizzler steaks.

My 10 year old and I went for dinner last week.  We&#39;ve been debating going to this place for a while and ultimately the desire to support a local business won.  Off we went.

The interior is really dated.  When we stepped in the restaurant was completely empty but the bar had several patrons.  Pretty loud folks, but not a problem because they were having fun and clearly knew each other.  The only real negative to the bar patrons was a couple who&#39;d step outside to smoke every 20 minutes.  Smoke-em-if-you-got-em!  Again, they weren&#39;t doing anything wrong but it&#39;s not pleasant to have the smell of smoke follow them through the dinning room directly past our table.  Hmm, ok.

The next red flag was ordering salads.  I asked for french dressing and the, very nice waitress, said &#34;you won&#39;t like it here&#34;.  Hmm, ok.

My ribeye was ordered and the waitress tells me &#34;the chef recommends a temperature of...&#34;.  Seems a bit officious but I&#39;ll go along.  When the steak arrived it was an extremely thin piece of meat sitting in a pool of juice.  Not juice.  A pool of juice.  Hmm, ok.  

My son had the beef wellington from the special menu.  He loves beef wellington and was really excited.  When it arrived it was a teeny-tiny puff.  It would surprise me if the steak inside were more than 3 or 4 ounces.  The accompanying sauce was smeared on the plate and when I tasted it - A1 steak sauce mixed with some sort of fruit flavor (I think).  Hmm, ok.

I told my son I wasn&#39;t going to review Walker&#39;s because I thought the people were SOOOO nice and his response was...  &#34;Dad, I bet the people who pay too much are nice too.  You should tell them about our experience&#34;.  Hmmmmm, ok.

For the $60 my son and I paid we could have done much better."

I would say that the only &#34;better&#34; value steak in the Chicago area that I have had was at Tango Sur on the North side of the city...but that is very far from me!

Ambiance is old-person-family-restaurant kind of place.  I.e., warm and comfortable.  Wood paneling, red carpet, etc.  Sometimes, that&#39;s exactly what I need.

It is not as dark as it used to be, but on a Saturday night, old Naperville invades the place.  They all have  &#34;standing&#34; reservations.&#34;  So, good luck trying to get in.  We arrived before the crowd and were able to snag a table.

We ordered cheeseburgers.  The menu says they come with fries, and you have to specify exactly what you would like on your burger:  i.e. lettuce, tomato, mustard, ketchup, onions, you get the picture.  Other than the French fries, you only get a bun.  Let me tell you, this bun was awful, seriously, we ate our cheeseburgers with a knife and fork.  We also asked for cole slaw.  Surprise, you only get one side, so they deleted the fries and gave us cole slaw instead.  When we had finished and were told that by our server, she asked if we wanted fries.  Too late.  We got our bill and left.

The service, while friendly, was just not good. I ordered an appetizer for my wife and I - Roasted Goat Cheese.  It was okay. My wife liked it better than I did, but it wasn&#39;t much more than crumbled goat cheese on top of a pool of ragu served with toasted bread.

My wife wasn&#39;t very hungry, so she ordered a baked potato and a salad.  I ordered the bone in ribeye, medium rare, with a salad and garlic mashed potatoes.

Wife&#39;s baked potato was cold. My steak, while absolutely delicious, was still over cooked.  Medium Rare should be a warm red center. I got hot pink.  It was really so tasty that I debated sending it back, and my so my wife decided for me. She said, &#34;it&#39;s a $40 steak - you should get it how you ordered it.&#34;

The waitress finally came by for a visit, and I told her the steak was over done.  She looked at it and said, &#34;oh, it looks a little over done&#34;. 

Then she looked at me.
And waited.

And finally said, &#34;did you want me to take it back?&#34;

&#34;Yes, please&#34;, I responded.
So she took the plate, and walked back in to the kitchen.

Two minutes later, she returned with another plate, which had me thinking that was awfully quick to straighten that out.
Not so fast... She put down the plate and on it was the same steak that I had sent back, cut into a bunch of pieces, and she said, &#34;the chef took a look at it and said it was a little bit over medium rare, but still okay to eat&#34;.

Then she looked at me.
And waited.

When I said nothing, she asked if I wanted another one, to which I responded, &#34;No.  Take this one away.&#34;

My wife took over, and told the waitress that I wanted a new steak, cooked properly.

I did end up with a steak that night, but it came out bleu. I ate it quietly.

The manager checked on us. I explained that there&#39;s some range between bleu, and medium, and the chef needed to be able to find that if he wanted to cook steak.  The manager made some excuses about how &#34;we cook medium rare that way here&#34;, and how, yes, it was a little bit overdone, but it wasn&#39;t THAT bad.  

I understand not throwing your staff under the bus, but I couldn&#39;t believe that a simple matter was handled so poorly.  Later on we did hear a commotion in the back, and something about the chef not getting another steak sent back, so I&#39;d say this was definitely a problem that night.  

The food was very flavorful.  Based on that alone, I expect we shall give it one more try, but it wasn&#39;t a nice experience."

Kathy was our server tonight and we can&#39;t wait to come back and try more of their specials! My fianc√© and I are both in sales so every now and then we like being sold on something as well...especially if it&#39;s a great piece of steak! 

We started out with an appetizer, in which our case was the fried cheese curds they came with a Sriracha ranch dipping sauce which had a nice kick to it. 

For our entr√©es my fiance did a porterhouse with asparagus and garlic mashed potatoes and I did a NY strip with mixed veggies and garlic mashed potatoes. Needless to say it was a great meal with plenty of leftovers. We even took mini desserts home (chocolate &amp; peanut butter mousse).

Overall definitely a 5 star rating from myself, and I most definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants a nice quiet sit down, great service, delicious food, and a hospitable staff! =)

 P.S. I can&#39;t wait to come back and try the rest of the menu!!"

When we were seated the hostess recommended the blackened grilled shrimp appetizer, Fantastic!
I had the bone in rib eye most expensive cut on the menu and thought it was as good of a steak as I have ever had.  My wife had the sirloin which was much less expensive but was every bit as wonderful.

You could not ask for better food or service.  We had prime rib and rib eye (cooked perfectly) plus wonderful salad, creamed spinach and a piece of keylime pie which was great.  Our table was off balance so the waiter took the time not to move us but fix the table.  The whole evening was wonderful.  One of the friends was coming back in July, 2016 and requested to go to this restaurant again and I also asked my son to come along because they have been living in Naperville for over 10 years and always go somewhere else out of naperville.  Unfortunately, this evening all of the food was horrible.  The steaks were either well done or raw (I mean blue raw) when we all asked for medium rare.  The key-lime pie is now homemade and the texture was way off and was not tart at all.  The service was horrible and just as a side note it was the same server that we had in April.  The unfortunate part is none of us will be going back and both of my friends are coming back in Oct, 2016 and this restaurant will not be on my list, very sad. In April my experience was a 5.  If they had an off night it should not be my money that pays for it."

I took a walk over today and enjoyed meeting the new owner Bryan Werschulz and Chef Ryan Gramit, while enjoying a half pound Mushroom Swiss Burger. We were getting the tail end of some lake effect snow and there wasn&#39;t a whole lot of traffic for lunch today.

I&#39;m looking forward to following them on Facebook, to learn more of their daily specials and other promotions. I was excited to learn there will be some changes but Bryan is certainly willing to keep their original customers content, while making sure his new guests enjoy their experience too. Bryan became the owner 10/01/13 and his changes sound exciting. 

I&#39;ll certainly be in soon to experience a ribeye steak and his daily soups. I over heard a discussion about &#34;all you can eat&#34; ribs on Thursdays. I hope they&#39;ll consider a half slab dinner special for $9.99, for those of us that don&#39;t find the value of an &#34;all you can eat&#34; special. (When all you can eat is a half slab.) Either way, I look forward to a half slab in my future as well.

A gradual remodeling of the interior seems to be in the works too. If you haven&#39;t been in for a while or you&#39;re a first timer, I think you&#39;ll be very happy with what so many consider &#34;the hidden jewel of Naperville.&#34; So come experience this well kept secret, with all of it&#39;s neighborhood charm. Rumor has it they make one great drink too. The hassles associated with downtown parking is not a worry here and there are some other hidden gems in this plaza. Casey&#39;s, Trader Joe&#39;s and Great Harvest Bread, to name just a few.

I certainly wish them great success serving up great gourmet food and maintaining the homey, local, neighborhood atmosphere. If you haven&#39;t seen their big debut on WGN, then you can catch it on YouTube... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf2knuENx80&amp;list=PL0mga4zXp5eH7y-AAfz0xOX0fk5_KJ2_7&amp;index=6"

Nice people (like the owner and the employees) - not the creepy patrons; horrendous decor - like a wisconsin supper club but without the charm; HIGH prices like $30-$40 steaks, and a lot of what tastes like a greek family style restaurant. But... the steaks are great. So like I said, I dunno. What I would suggest is spending the money on a restaurant makeover - maybe call food network or something.

Naperville is getting over run with chains and the idea of a good locally owned steak house was very appealing, but for me it just doesn&#39;t cut it. Extremely helpful and friendly staff if a bit slow, and the new owner came by several times to talk to us. But the food was disappointing. 

Calamari was just OK, a little greasy and maybe under cooked served with a very average sauce. But the steaks was where the real heart break was. $39 for an 18oz bone in rib eye is pushing premium steak house prices but it was awful. Maybe 1 inch thick with a scraggly bone sticking out, not well marbelled at all. Other people got strips or filets and we&#39;re equally disappointed. Honestly, every single steak at Sams or Costco would be better than these. Also, their doneness scale skews towards well. I ordered medium and it came out dry, no pink, at least medium well. I sent it back and they brought out another that was slightly more juicy, but again no pink. Every one else was almost done at this point so I just went with but didn&#39;t finish. 

Much better options for steaks in the area. I hope they can turn it around but something needs to happen in terms of the quality before I&#39;d consider going back."

Planned to sit at the bar, have a beer, and place a to-go order.   Sat and waited for a long time.  Bartender was not attentive.  

Ended up being joined by a friend so we grabbed the high top at the bar.  Took a while for the waiter to come over.  It is true we were a bit of a moving target but any restaurant should have been able to notice us and get us service.  It truly was ridiculous and we were about 1s away from leaving.

Was a decent atmosphere.  Comfortable and not too fancy.  Was not too loud in the bar for having a beer and talking.  Placed order to go and food came out well packaged and hot.  Got home and there were accuracy issues with our order - not the right sides.  French fries are always soggy when taken to go, which is why I ordered rice pilaf.  Got fries though.

So let me tell you what was good.  The burger was very good.  The seafood pasta was also very good.  The beer selection included a number of craft beers so this was a big score.  The one I really wanted (Anti-Hero) was out so I had to substitute a Lagunitas All Day which is not so bad either!

They will get another chance but good food cannot make up for poor service.  I hope it was just a bad day for the wait staff.

Next time I will go for steaks and sit in the dining room.  This is their primary mission so I will hold judgement until having that experience.  Until then, three stars."

After years of not eating here, we have been here twice in a very short time.  The reason for that is the food is outstanding.  Just don&#39;t look at the octopus spread out on the ice on the right as you walk in the door.  However, I think the display of that moves around.  Although, I have been told by more than one person (and at least one of them NOT Greek ) that the octopus is good.  I am not that adventurous when it comes to my food.  There is an extensive selection on the regular menu, and daily specials.  Anything ordered was &#34; delicious &#34; as described by those who were eating it.  Portions are very generous so there is plenty to share if the others are willing.  The leftovers will travel well to work, to make your co-workers drool, or they can be enjoyed in the privacy of your own home where you can savor every mouthful and make as many noises and faces as you would like..
Yes, it can get very busy and crowded, but most of those people are speaking Greek ~ that alone should tell you something.  Yes, parking at peak times can be difficult. Yes, it can get loud.  But all those things are forgotten by the deliciousness of the food.  Oh,also, they have a 2-sided fireplace.  One side is on the entry side, the other on the dining room side.  On a rather blustery evening, we were lucky enough to be seated at the table in front of the fire.
For what you get, the prices are reasonable."

For starters, on a cold day or night warm up with an order of Saganaki! It&#39;s the flaming cheese appetizer sure to delight the savory taste bud. 

I&#39;ve tried several items from their menu from their lunch specials to dinner and every item has always been delicious. For lunch, you can never go wrong with the gyro plate or for the chicken and veggie lover, the chicken on a spit salad is hands down a pleaser.

They have a bar to order wine and mixed drinks alike. They also offer space for special events from birthdays to funerals.

The space is cozy and on a breezy night, try and find a spot to sit near their fireplace. 

I took away a star for their sometimes slow service. I&#39;ve eaten here several times during the busy lunch hour but that should not be a reason. They should staff accordingly and train appropriately. With that said, to keep away from slow waiters try to make it before noon or after 1:30pm.

Recently, we sat on the patio. Secluded and romantic. Same great service and of course all the great trimmings of this place. 

We always get the flaming cheese (OOOPAH!) and the cold platter. Then we try to order one of the specials or do half orders such as the eggplant lasagna, spinach pie, grape leaves.... you cannot go wrong with this outstanding greek food. 

We have a small child along who loved the greek speggetti and meatballs too. 

Fish, lamb, even GF or veggie choices. Try any of the greek wines which are affordable."

Our first date was at Dianna&#39;s on Halstead in 1981.  I was a Texas girl and had never had Greek food and fell in love with Saganaki (flaming cheese) and this Polish young man!!  We came back to Chicago and found the great reviews on Yelp for Greek Islands because we wanted to celebrate 35 years of a wonderful life together!  WOW, our waiter Philip took great care of us this evening.  The saganaki was as delicious as I remember, and the rest of our evening helped us celebrate our special occasion!"

You&#39;re greeted at the door by a friendly host each time, and service has always been great by all servers and bussers.

As for food, I&#39;ve only recently begun to switch things up, but I&#39;ve had the grilled octopus appetizer, cold calamari and shrimp appetizer, saganaki, gyros, kokkinisto, arne fornou, spaghetti, and few other dishes.

This review is for this location, but the experience is great at either one. We, most recently, decided to come here on a Saturday because we had not been in here a while and another plan had fallen through. 

It was not crowded (yet) and we were seated right away. Immediately you get bread and water. There&#39;s olive oil on the table for dipping. Service is always quick and cordial. They have an amazing deal for a family style dinner-don&#39;t let the name fool you, you can take part in this with as little as two people. We decided to go for it because it was a great deal at 24.95 a person. With that price we got saganaki, a plate of gyros meat, and a choice of three spreads. And that was just the appetizer. You also get a salad and a choice of 3 items for dinner. This comes with a side of rice and potatoes. AND you get a variety of dessert at the end. 

It was a ton of food. It was also delicious and came prepared wonderfully. Our service was great throughout the entire experience. I love Greek Islands because they are consistent with service and with great food. If you want Greek food, this is really one of the few great places to go and always be satisfied."

You lose nothing by not going to Greek Town. This past weekend we had another great meal of doulmades, octopus, beef tenderloin and saganaki. I wanted to mention a young kid named Adam who was our waiters helper. Just an amazing young kid who could not have been happier and more helpful. He had only been there a week and yet was doing an exceptional job. It&#39;s easy to recognize the hostess, the waiters and the cooks but this kid would make anyone come back again.

Uh, I certainly hope not for the sake of the people of Chicago!  You gave birth to Alinea--I refuse to believe this is all you can do with Greek cuisine!

We got the family style dinner at the recommendation of our colleague; she said it gave a wide variety of choices for not too much money.  That was spot on.  I can&#39;t remember the last time we had so much on the table of OK-quality food for so little.  But the devil is in the details.

The Saganaki (cheese flamed in a pan at table side) was actually very good.  Warm and gooey inside and slightly charred on the outside with a salty goodness that makes it a terrific way to start.  The Skordalia spread, however, earned one bite and then went untouched.  We ordered the gyro as an appetizer and it was one of the high points of the meal.  Possibly because it&#39;s one of the more popular dishes, it was fresh and moist and had great flavor.

The entrees had one star: the chicken oreganato (SP?) which was fresh, simple, and good.  But the moussaka and the spinach pie had that texture and flavor of food that has been kept warm all day over a steam table.  Mush.

Dessert was the final place to shine.  My aunt Ellen made the worlds best Galatoburiko custard, so I was hoping they could come through on a favorite. Unfortunately, it too seemed to have been thrown together as an afterthought.  The custard was dried and a little rubbery.  I only had one bite, so I don&#39;t remember much about the flavor.

I would like to say, however, that the staff there were all VERY nice and friendly.  I would say that the best way to experience Greek Isles is NOT to get the family style meals because there&#39;s just way too much food per person unless you&#39;re planning on taking a lot home.  I&#39;d also go with individual meals because you can cherry pick the good things, like the Saganaki, the gyro, and the chicken oreganata."

We thought the restaurant was packed when we arrived but they seated us right away! We had a wonderful server (Phillip) and he was never out of eye sight. Always attentive, always one step ahead of us. We noticed what appeared to be a manager floating the entire restaurant making sure everything was okay. Not like your chain restaurants where they ask you if everything is okay and then you&#39;re forced to have an awkward conversation with them. No this manager walked around and even stood in the corner with a watchful eye making sure everyone wasn&#39;t waiting on anything, that tables got refills on drinks, that chairs and tables were set and cleaned for the next guests. It was impressive. 

Food was amazing! Souvlaki was perfect, moussaka was so good and a great vegetarian option, and of course the baklava was out of this world! Loved their olive oil which I found was imported. They offer the option to buy olive oil, honey, fresh oregano, and a few other things too! Prices seemed really great and comparable to markets in the area. We will be returning to purchase a big bottle of olive oil! It tasted so fresh! I was so pleased with our experience here!"

Portions, service, quality are all excellent. I had the gyro app plate and it was enough to make a large gyro. The meat was perfect, and I loved the thinly sliced onions.
I had the chicken kabob plate and it was outstanding. Juicy, not overcooked. The side of rice and veggies seemed a bit watery, salty, and overcooked. Probably the product of sitting in a food warmer too long.
Overall, a great place. I&#39;d come back in a heartbeat."
greek-islands-lombard,Lily F.,Oavbr8dUe96Ap75kSwHhww,"Northlake, IL",1,1,1,397,1,JB-jKrhCk_x2rcL74QJ8Gg,4.0,2015-12-01,"I&#39;m glad this location exists, away from the downtown area and all of the congested traffic-y areas.  First off, this restaurant is huge inside with an equally huge parking lot.  Second, this place does not skimp on the quality or on the quantity.  My friend and I decided to get the family style to sample a little bit of everything and for the amount of food and the experience, I thought it was priced very well (around $22 pp). Our family style included: 3 apps, salad, 4 entrees with sides, dessert and coffee.  To go through each item would be a headache for you to read and for me to write, so the standouts for me were the saganaki, pork on the spit, Spanakotiropita, and the gyros. 

I got that everyone wanted the saganaki because it&#39;s fun to watch the servers not torch their eyebrows, but I wasn&#39;t expecting it be so damn tasty.  The fried cheese has a crispy edge and the lemon pairs very well with it.  The gyros and onion was another great little appetizer and again, the crispy edges were a win for us.  The pork on the spit is something I would highly recommend.  Yes, crispy skin again, but it was just seasoned so well, tender and a little fatty just the way I like it.  The spanakotiropita was flaky, cheesy and couldn&#39;t have been better.  Even the salad tasted pretty amazing even though it was so simple.  Everything was fresh and the service was spot on.  

Some random things: Besides the apps, the entrees were combined on two separate plates for each diner even though we ordered family style.  So we each had our own plate of the 4 mini entr√©e items that we ordered together along with a side of rice and potatoes.  Not good or bad, but had everything came out in the middle for a true free for all like I thought it would, it would have made it easier for me to eat disproportionately more of the delicious pork and leave the bf with more of the dry lamb.  Speaking of which, the roast lamb was a bit dry and not really something I would get again.  I think it was just sliced too thin and with the competing pork, it had no chance.  The dessert was decent but overly sweet for me so I was only able to eat tiny bites.  Overall, it was a great experience and I found a great new Greek place. Opa!"

Saganaki $6.50 - Opa! You really can&#39;t go wrong with flaming cheese.

Grilled calamari $10 - Yummy naked grilled squid.

Pastichio $13 - This dish looks tastier than it was but it landed on the bland side."

I think it says a lot about a restaurant that draws a huge crowd on a Sunday or weekday evening.  

Greek Islands has menu items that are suitable for both meat eaters and vegetarians. I love their lemon egg soup here, and and some of their other starters. One of their dinner options even allows you to select a couple of the popular menu items and make them part of your whole meal for one set price. This is a good option both veterans and newbies of Greek cuisine.  Their menu also includes many wine items, and even some other alcoholic items as well. Every member of the staff at Greek Islands is also super friendly and readily available to make your dining experience memorable."

I tried several seafood dishes and liked them all - the grilled octopus was fantastic.

My husband picked me up from work down the street one Saturday when I got off work a little a little early and I remembered this was just around the corner. I suggested Greek food and he said sure so we went to Greek Islands. It was early enough to we didn&#39;t need to wait at all for a table. 

The beautiful blonde hostess sat us in the back dining area just a few tables from the kitchen. 

Our server was Niko (I believe). He was very kind, knew the menu and was pretty much on top of everything.  I barely looked at the menu. I just asked him what he liked outside of the seafood realm and he suggested the pork with bell peppers. And my husband asked for a fish referral and he ended up with a white fish.

We kicked off our meal with meatballs that had a lot of great flavor and fresh break with butter and/or oil. I love the sesame bread. 

Waters never were lower than half way down thank you to the bus persons. Tables were kept cleared when you were done eating each course. 

I tried the Cabernet Greek wine and loved it. 

My husband ate every single bite of his fish and I tore up my pork dish. There was so much, my husband and I were able to make dinner off it for the next evening with the rice &amp; potatoes. 

Lastly, I can tell a good Greek place by their baklava. I was too stuffed to try it there but I took one piece to go. My only issues is their pricing for the balava for the portion size, there were was quite a wait to try to get our food packed up and pay our bill. Luckily, we didn&#39;t have to get too much done after dinner so it worked out. 

Final comment is that the place needs a fresh coat of paint and I received a dirty fork. I think they have a few kinds to work out and a little updating. The display cases were quite aged and a little dirty. 

Thank you all for making our experience so lovely."

My husband and I moved to Arkansas from the western suburbs a few years ago and this was our first stop when we got into town tonight. We shared a Saganaki and a cold plate for an appetizer. The cheese was rich and tart at the same time and the cold plate with a crisp delicious seafood salad, beets, Lima beans, feta cheese and three dips was perfect on a hot night. Despite the weather I had a cup of egg lemon soup (theirs is light, tart and velvety smooth) and an order of the pork kabobs which is an appetizer but I took home half since I had already indulged so much. DH had the gyro plate which was HUGE. The meat was tender and properly seasoned. Paired with a glass of house white (the only dry wine DH likes) it was an awesome meal.

Sometimes a little salty.  I order the Combination Platter.  I love the Sauce Served over the Roast Lamb.  A Beefy Lamb Gravy that is the perfect compliment to a platter full of Authentic Style Greek Food.  I believe there is an article from a write up on this sauce posted out front.   I have had the combination a few times .. The amount of sauce is inconsistent.. I&#39;m sure if the server were to check back with the table you could ask for more. 

My Man ordered the Salmon Salad... Visual appeal .. He likes to get it with extra Tomatoes.   Said he enjoyed the Salad. 

We ordered the flaming Saganaki to start..The &#34;older male server&#34; could have used a little of  the Brandy to put a fire in him... I felt we were putting him out to go through the motions.  Menu says served with flat bread .. Which was not served with the order.   Im certain he did not engage in conversation or smile during the service.  Don&#39;t ask him questions .. I get it you aren&#39;t there to entertain us. 

The other server assistants .. Bus People perhaps that were pouring water were very personable.  Would engage in conversation and were delightful.

The staff are so welcoming and pleasant from the moment you walk in until you leave. We started with saganati, which is a pan of goat cheese in oil that is lit on fire table side. I was not sure what to expect but what I got was so much better than I could have imagined! The flames give a light crunch to the outside and the inside is melted and delicious. We actually ended up ordering a second one it was so good. The lemon rice soup is very nice. Not too lemony.

I originally ordered the arni fournou and our waiter came back and informed me that they were out. Must be pretty good then. He suggested I instead try another lamb dish that included artichokes. It was good, I always love lamb. I wish I had gotten to try my original order though.

I tried my first shot of ouzo, I am not sure if I will have anymore. Black licorice is not my favorite. However, their baklava was delicious. It had all the crispy, sweet layered goodness I have tasted in the past but this one was not overly sweet like others I had tried.

The food is excellent and the wait staff is always super friendly, even though they probably want to go in the back room and hang themselves every time someone orders Saganaki.

Kababs, are all delicious. Desserts are solid and the artichoke appetizer/side is amazing.

It&#39;s also part of some space time rift where every table but you is there for a birthday because you will hear Happy Birthday sung by the wait staff no less than 17 times during your dinner."

The interesting Mykonos-style windmill design of the building provides a very expansive setting. The menu is quite varied. It would be difficult to complain that there weren&#39;t enough choices. The Greek-speaking all-male wait staff gives a touch of authenticity and the speed at which courses are produced was surprising. This may be the only one of the Greek-town restaurants on Chicago&#39;s Halstead street that has ventured into the suburbs, but it&#39;s a gift to foodies who don&#39;t want to face rush hour traffic to dine at one of the Greek treasures downtown."

We&#39;ve tried Santorini in Greek Town too but we will always come back to Greek Islands because it is delicious. 

Our most recent trip was on a Monday night and it was crazy busy, but the service is always fast and efficient. We had an excellent waiter on Monday who was very friendly and attentive. The ambiance is great because it looks like a little Greek village and the tables are full of big parties tables and lots of people.

The best option by far is to do the family style, which is more food than you could ever possibly finish (especially with only 2 people like us) but at only $22.95 it&#39;s a great deal and you&#39;ll have leftovers. 

You can&#39;t go wrong with this combination:

First of all, the bread and olive oil is excellent. But if you want to make it through the meal, try not to eat too much. 

Appetizer: (1) Saganaki (2) Gyros (3) Scordalia - garlic spread 

Salad: Athenian 

Main course: Dolmades, Spanakotiropita, Keftedes, Chicken Rignati 

(everything above is absolutely delicious) 

Dessert: Baklava and Galaktoburiko (I&#39;m allergic so I got some sort of flan and it was great) 

If you eat as much as we do, you wont be able to move, but you&#39;ll be happy and incredibly satisfied with the meal. If you&#39;re going to Greek Town, don&#39;t skip out on Greek Islands!"

Food and service were both extremely good.  The prices were reasonable.

As another reviewer has stated, there was a manager floating the entire restaurant making sure everything was okay.  There were at least two bus boys who constantly filled water glasses and took away dirty dishes.  One walked by a diner who had dropped his knife, immediately picked it up and returned with a new knife within a minute.

Only negative...when I got home, I noticed that there was a &#34;N/A Beverage&#34; charge of $2.95 at the bottom of the bill (after the food total).  As there was a $2.95 beverage charge in the itemized column, I think we were charged $2.95 each for the two lemonades my companion had.  Guess lemonade is not part of the free refills that most restaurants give for soft drinks."

The food was yummy and our server, Donald, was great! I had the Avgolemono soup, the large Athenian salad platter w/grilled octopus, and a lemonade. 

The Avgolemono soup has chicken broth, rice, and egg-lemon. The texture of the soup is kind of creamy and reminded me of rice porridge. You can taste the lemon in this soup so if you like lemons as much as I do, then you&#39;ll love this soup. 

My salad was delicious! The grilled octopus was nice &amp; tender and the salad was the traditional Greek salad, which contained mixed greens, cucumbers, tomatoes, feta cheese, and olives. The dressing they used was very tasty too!

My boyfriend had the gyros and I, of course, had to taste some. It was probably one of the best gyros I&#39;ve ever had and I don&#39;t usually like gyros! The meat was well seasoned and made to perfection! The pita bread also tasted very fresh and was delish!"

I was kind of confused though because I thought the menu said rice and potatoes, but I just got rice. Of course I ordered saganaki, how can you not! Overall, everything was very good. The meal was huge, so I had leftovers.

However, if you&#39;re just interested in one or two Greek food items you could go pretty much anywhere else in Chicago because Greek family restaurant/diner/pancake houses are a dime a dozen, and almost all of them have a &#34;Greek Specialities&#34; section of the menu.

This past Friday my wife and I joined our out-of-town family members for dinner at Greek Islands and it was very good. The food was great, the service was terrific and despite the place being packed, there wasn&#39;t a wait.

I&#39;m quite surprised, actually, by how busy they are considering the plethora of Greek food available in suburban Chicago. Our waiter treated us like family, making sure water glasses and other drinks stayed full the entire night. He checked on us regularly and made us feel at home. 

Food came out quickly, was hot, flavorful and downright good. The grocery store I shop at has the same stuff I ordered in its prepared foods section, but I enjoy it so I decided to give it a try here. I had the moussaka. It was very-well made and tasty. The serving I had was large and I left full. 

I&#39;d say that overall Greek Islands impressed me. I wouldn&#39;t expect a specialty Greek restaurant to fare well in this area, considering all its competition. But they do what they do well and that&#39;s important. Nicely done."

First, I called 4 days prior to make a reservation as we had 10 people and I know this place gets busy. They don&#39;t take reservations for after 5PM. When we got there, they made us wait until our entire party arrived before they even put us on the list! We all went to the bar to get a drink and wait around for our table.. for 40 minutes, no place to sit and all of us huddled in the small bar area. When we finally got seated we asked for separate checks before we even ordered our drinks. Apparently, they do not do separate checks. How does a restaurant not do separate or split checks? We even asked to speak to a manager. He said it would tie up the POS. Really? Our server came back and told us if it wasn&#39;t busy when we were ready to pay, he would split it for us. He ended up being able to so that ended ok. Told the waiter it was our friends birthday, twice. Nothing was done for him, even thought the table next to us got a dessert and birthday song. Food - they were out of what I wanted, the lamb and artichoke hearts with a lemon sauce. That was disappointing so I ordered something else. It was the special and was lamb in a red sauce with orzo. The lamb was amazing! Tender and a large portion but the orzo was gross. It just tasted bad and I didn&#39;t eat it. Everyone else at the table was happy with their food. Here is the kicker, they charged EVERYONE at my tables credit card twice!!! Still waiting to hear back from them as to why and already disputed with my bank. 

My friend was really excited to go here and while everyone enjoyed their food the service was just eh and I felt we were rushed and more of an inconvenience that an appreciated customer. We also had to park across the street because the parking lot was completely full. I don&#39;t normally post reviews, but I was just so disappointed with the overall experience."

Welcome to Greek Islands! 

First, I LOVE Greek food and entered this establishment extremely excited at its claims of authenticity. So no one is sadder about this review than me. 

I came in for lunch and sat at the bar where the bartender took forever to finally bring me a menu. They have no lunch menu so I made my way to the entrees section. They had about 4 different chicken items that had exotic names but were described almost exactly the same (&#34;marinated in extra virgin olive oil, and Greek spices...&#34;). Confused, I asked the bartender to explain the differences between the dishes. Rather than do so, he made a recommendation! I should get the &#34;chicken from the spit.&#34; How could I refuse? I have enclosed a picture of what I received just so you know I&#39;m not exaggerating. It was about 6 oz. of chicken, a pile of white onions, a single slice of tomato and tsaziki sauce with a single (not pictured) pita. The price tag for this &#34;feast?&#34; $13.95! I&#39;m embarrassed to even type this but the amazing thing is that this was what was recommended! Can you imagine how much worse I could have been ripped off if I had just picked from their atrociously put together menu? 

Still hungry and willing to believe that the menu item I ate might have been the exception rather than the rule of this joint, I ordered a Taxas salad after finishing my &#34;entree.&#34; An additional $5.95 brought me a dish that reminded me of something my mother would have made, a woman that was neither Greek nor particularly adept at the culinary arts. Small in portion, small in taste, terribly presented lettuce sprinkled with an occasional tomato and piece of feta. 

To add irritation to insult and injury, they also charged me 2.95 for sparkling water from the bar tap, which they deemed a &#34;club soda&#34; (no lime to be found). All in, I spent a whomping $24.95 (I also gave a $3.00 tip bringing it up to $27.95, don&#39;t ask me why) for a deconstructed pita, side salad and drink--again, this was a lunch--in a remote suburb--on a Thursday. 

Questions abound: are the owners about to go out of business and cutting corners on their customers? Have mainland Greece&#39;s austerity problems finally hit Lombard, IL? I&#39;ll never know the answers to these questions because there&#39;s no way in hell I&#39;m ever setting foot in this place again."

They only have 3 handicapped parking spots, which were all taken. My mother uses a walker and so I had to unload her at the door, then go find a place to park. It was 3pm on a Saturday but I had to park quite far as the lot was full. Oh well, I figured it was worth it as we love good (key word: GOOD) Greek food.

We ordered a bottle of rose wine. The waiter (who wasn&#39;t even Greek and didn&#39;t know any Greek words!) poured us a taste; we said it was too dry. He didn&#39;t suggest something else or offer to open another bottle; he just filled our glasses and walked away.

We ordered the saganaki; our waiter&#39;s &#34;OPA&#34; was half-hearted and not enthusiastic. We heard other waiters shouting &#34;OPA!!!&#34; with glee! Have had this appetizer many times before in other Greek restaurants; this one didn&#39;t taste right (something was off).

Mom ordered the lemon rice soup; it was bland.  Tasted like Campbell&#39;s cream of chicken soup out of the can with rice added to it, a thick and gloppy mess with no flavor.

I ordered the lamb with artichokes &amp; lemon sauce. The piece of lamb (on the shank) was small and comprised of mostly fat &amp; gristle. The sauce was like wallpaper paste and tasteless. My mom ordered the lamb in tomato sauce; it was so-so. Portions here are not generous, at least they weren&#39;t with the two entrees we ordered.

When I stepped away to use the ladies room, my mom told our waiter it was my birthday. He nodded and said ok. After we had coffee, he just brought the bill and said goodbye.

As we were leaving, my mom told the owner and manager about my birthday. He said &#34;Did you tell your waiter it was your birthday?&#34; My mom said she certainly did and he said &#34;Well, next time you come in, we will make a big fuss for your birthday.&#34; Didn&#39;t even offer a dessert to go which would have been the right thing to do!

We spent almost $100 for bad service, tasteless food and a miserable time. We should have taken the trouble to drive to The Parthenon in Greektown, as everything we&#39;ve ever had there has been delicious and the service is excellent (and the waiters are GREEK!!!). 

We will never return here again...save your money and go somewhere else."

The stuffed tomatoes are vegetarian on Saturdays, I&#39;m not sure what is in them the rest of the week. The spanakotiropita is philo dough with cooked spinach and feta cheese, it was really good. 

 Our server, Dimitrios was awesome. Ask to get seated at one of his tables. Being our first time, he helped us pick our dinner, beers and wine options. He was spot on. Dimitrios is your traditional Greek man, built like he use to wrestle bears but has a very deep voice that reminds you of your grandpa.

Started going here when I was a young Health Inspector for the Du Page County Health Department.  Our original work group still gets together here the first weekend in December.  We love Greek Islands in Lombard.  Regardless of who you  are you are treated like family from the moment you walk in.  This is a locally owned establishment that is a great value and the food is consistently good.  Try the cold sampler plate and ask for some extra Taramosalata!  The traditional  Greek bread with sesame seeds goes well with all the spreads.  A cup of avgolemeno will warm you up.

Grilled octopus appetizer is delicious and tender; fried zucchini with skordalia (garlicy spread) is well done here too.  Athenian salad is ample.  You can seriously fill up on appetizers and not have room for an entree.   I recommend pairing your dinner with not a generic roditis but the Makedonikos Tsantali version, ask for the little juice glasses for authenticity if you get a bottle.

For entrees I usually share the larger lamb chops done medium.  Shrimp dish is also quite tasty if not a bit on the rich side.  Chicken riganati is always tasty as well.  I just don&#39;t think you can go wrong here.

If they have the svigous for dessert give it a try (they only make it two days a week).  Otherwise I like a fresh cup of coffee and the creme caramella.

Having known a lot of Greek&#39;s from my work, I always ask them what Greek restaurant is their favorite and to a person they have always said Greek Islands!"

So, to me, if a restaurant can get that right...it&#39;s a winner.  I&#39;m not saying its perfect every single time, a few times its been alright, but the majority of the  time the food is consistently good.  On top of that, the portion sizes are generous and the prices are very reasonable.  Plus where can you find free valet parking in the city?  There&#39;s obviously a reason why this place is always busy even on a Tuesday at 9:00pm.  In my opinion, it&#39;s an all around great restaurant and a guaranteed good meal."

I have to compliment Edgar our server tonight.  He was the definition of 5star server.  Knowledgeable, attentive and his suggestions were spot on.  He was able to get me one of the last portions of Roast suckling pig A+++.

I have been to the Greek Isles and the Ambiance here is spot on.  A+

Tonight we ate the following;

Apps
Feta Bruchetta - A
Grilled Calamari.- A+
Saganaki - A (how could fried cheese not be an A??!?)

Dinner
Roast Suckling Pig (Sundays only) A+++
Lavraki (related to the sea bass) A
Broiled  Lamb Arni - A+ 
BBQ lamb special - A

Dessert
Greek Tiramusu B (just ok)
Rice pudding (no vote, I hate ANY rice pudding)
Chocolate Cake - C (juicy cake layer was a turn off)

I absolutely love this place.  I eat here as often as possible!  You can&#39;t find a Greek place (especially outside of the city) that tops The Greek Islands!!"

Unfortunately, the service is TERRIBLE!!!!!
First, I was ignored by the waitress Christine. I gave her credit thinking she was busy. when I asked questions about the menu, I was told to think about what I want and then she disappeared for 15min

When she removed the bone from a fish, 1/3 of the fish was gone 

When we request to see the original check since we have to split bill, we practically get yell at. The best part is she was standing there watching us. I really mean watching like a hawk to make sure we tip her

The place is huge, they don&#39;t take reservations but you won&#39;t have a problem getting seated. Everything on the menu is outstanding and the prices are very good for what you get. I highly recommend the leg of lamb and the Greek sea bass which they will de-bone for you at your table. It says market price next to the Greek sea bass but it usually runs about $25. Of course you cannot go without ordering the Saganaki which they do a very good job with. Most of the servers are Greek and there is always Greek music playing which positively adds to the atmosphere. I recommend ordering the Roditis wine, it is very tasty and has an awesome light red color. You also definitely want to finish up dinner with a Greek yogurt with honey and nuts and a Greek espresso with Sambuca. Order up good when you come here, you won&#39;t regret it."

- Dolmades (in a lemon wine cream sauce)
- Spinach cheese pie
- Tzatziki dipping sauce

The pig roast was horribly dry when we ordered it about a year ago but now was delicious. The chicken kabob is grilled &#34;naturally&#34; and tastes great; some other Greek restaurants drown it in olive oil while grilling, but here it sits in a light broth and is very flavorful.

I had barbecue lamb that was so soft and tender, and my dad had the other lamb special that he loved too.  He said it reminded him of his mother&#39;s slow-roast cooking where the meat was so tender.

...but the finale of the meal is the reason that I came on here to write this review..  The AMBROSIA DESSERT is DELICIOUS.  It&#39;s honey, vanilla ice cream, Greek pastry, some nuts, and more amazingness put together... I recommend it to everyone!!!"

Food good, but like many Greek restaurants they hurry you through dinner like it&#39;s a prison cafeteria. I get the rush in the city when on your way to a Bulls/Hawks game, but it is not needed here. Waiter hovering, dying to take your order. I am forced to use a system when we order each course only when finished with the previous course. Even then, you are done in an hour.  My big gripe, our waiter, a nice guy, made me feel like we were tourists getting hustled. Get this. We were a table of six, not all adults, celebrating a birthday. We ordered  taramasalata to start. He brought TWO orders. Okay, we were hungry, we would work on it. We followed with an order of saganaki, &#34;flaming cheese&#34;. Made it clear &#34;one order of saganaki&#34; were my exact words. He brought TWO. They were on fire before we could even notice. Left half an order. A trend was beginning. Not wanting to damper the mood, I said nothing, but was intent on making the next course, very CLEAR to Nick, our waiter. I explained to him that we wanted a tomato salad combined with a green salad. (They have done it before). He assured me, I will take care of it. Viola, TWO f****ing salads appeared. We barely finished one. Perhaps it was my fault for not being an a**hole and sending the double orders back, but I did not want to disturb the celebratory mood. I am convinced this is an &#34;upsell&#34; and not any misunderstanding. Very bizarre. You are all warned. Make things clear"

The restaurant is a fairly large place with multiple seating areas.  I was there on a cold night and was able to get right next to the fireplace, which was perfect.

Their specialty is the seabass.  I had it last time and it was a great dish.  Grilled octopus is also another &#34;famous&#34; dish of theirs.  I didn&#39;t think it was meaty enough though. It was charred on outside and then served in a lemon/olive oil sauce.  My favorite was the gyros.  They have a slightly different flavor meat than most.  I doesn&#39;t seem the normal foodservice bought slab of gyros.  The tzatziki sauce was nice fresh garlicky and I willingly slobbered it all over the gyros meat.

I stuck with the standard fare, but the menu selection is very wide and everyone in the group will be able to find something they like about this place!"

I had actually completely not even realized that there was a location in Lombard!  We had planned on going to Greektown but it was so damn cold and I didn&#39;t feel like possibly having to walk a great distance if we couldn&#39;t find somewhat close parking so we decided to come here!

First of all, we got that Facebook coupon for 25% off Monday through Friday from 2pm to 4pm.  We used it on MLK Jr day which was perfect.  (This is the first time we went, we ate dinner there again last night).  

So anyway, the first time, it wasn&#39;t crowded at all.  We had looked at the menu beforehand and had decided we would try the family dinner that comes with crazy amounts of food.  My husband had never eaten at a Greek restaurant before so I thought it&#39;d be fun for him to sample multiple things.  

So as we were choosing our 4 entrees, I mentioned we were picking two with meat and two without since I&#39;m a non meat eater.  For some reason, our waiter was explaining that this would be a problem.  I didn&#39;t understand what he meant because my logic was that I just wouldn&#39;t eat the lamb.  It&#39;s still a mystery to me why we couldn&#39;t have ordered that way.  There must be a reason but it&#39;s not like I would be forced to eat lamb if it was sitting in front of me.  This then prompted an intense discussion (in Spanish, no less) between my husband and the waiter.  I sat there, mystified.  

So the result of that was that my husband would order a combination plate (leg of lamb, mousaka, dolmades, meatball, vegetables &amp; potatoes) and I ordered the &#34;create a combo&#34; - two half orders of vegetarian mousaka and spanakotiropita (which is exactly what I would&#39;ve ordered if we got the family style).  We also ordered saganaki (how could we not?) and tirokafteri with pita bread.  

So on this initial visit, our waiter was not the best.  The exchange about the family style was just effing weird and we had to ask like twice for the pita bread.  The 25% off coupon made a huge difference though so we weren&#39;t in a position to complain.  I also decided to order a glass of wine so I got the only one that was labeled as &#34;sweet&#34; (samos muscat) because I love sweet wines.  The waiter warned me that it was VERY sweet and I said yes, that&#39;s what I like!  Bring it on!  Ha, well.  Being unfamiliar with it and thinking it&#39;d be reminiscent of moscato, I was in for a surprise.  It wasn&#39;t so much sweet as it was thick!  It was almost like drinking honey or cough syrup.  I couldn&#39;t finish it.  I should&#39;ve heeded the waiter&#39;s advice.  

We were kind of bummed because both of us got so full so fast.  We ate way too much bread and olive oil - a mistake we did not repeat last night.  

On to last night...

Our waiter was awesome and the place was pretty packed.  Good thing it&#39;s HUGE in there because we didn&#39;t really have to wait.  We ordered our saganaki and tirokafteri with pita bread again.  Husband had Spartan chicken (which came with rice) and I got the vegetarian kabob which I didn&#39;t even remember seeing on the menu last time.  

Our order came out perfect and the pita bread was delivered with the tirokafteri, yay!  

I ordered a glass of riesling this time, which I&#39;m glad to say I enjoyed.  

My veggie kabob was really good.  When I bit into the tomato, it like exploded in my mouth it was so juicy and good.  Pretty hot though so I kind of burned my mouth on the first few bites.  I couldn&#39;t wait for it to cool.  It came with two &#34;skewers&#34; and I was only able to eat like one and a quarter.  The spices/seasoning they put on it was very apparent.  I woke up the next morning and still had little bits of it in my mouth!

Husband ordered ambrosia for dessert.  

&#39;Tis safe to say he absolutely loves Greek food now and this place will be in our regular dining out rotation.  

Our total bill was $52.99 which included appetizers, two entrees, wine and dessert.  More than we usually spend, but not bad considering what we got.  And I feel healthier eating there with the olive oil and all that.   

We are bigass fans."

Friendly enough but terrible service we did did not order for another twenty minutes. The food was good but very expensive for what we got.  This was a birthday dinner and there was no acknowledgement of that even though we were promised free desert for waiting.  The kids did not like the Greek Lasagna (must agree).

Luckily for us, the weather which is normally all polar on us, was in the 40s which feels like the desert heat at this time of year so we got to stand outside while we waited. They have complimentary valet which is a plus. The hostess was nice but she quoted us a half an hour to 40 minute wait on a Saturday night around 7:30 so get here earlier if you don&#39;t want to wait as much because it stinks that they don&#39;t take reservations. Also, what I found to be really annoying is that your whole party has to be here before you can even get a pager. What if i want to be that nice friend who comes in and decides to wait for all of us while the other arrive. Nope, I couldn&#39;t do that. So I had to wait for my friends for 20 minutes and then an additional half an hour to get that damn pager. That left a sour taste in my mouth. 

Now onto the place. It&#39;s cute, Greece like per say but very crowded. I mean I felt a little suffocated here if you ask me since there were sooo many people. Even in the long foyer, it felt like a million people so I was happy that I had some time to breath some fresh air outside since inside was overcrowded. The tables in the room that we were sat were also really close to one another but I wasn&#39;t going to let that stand in my way. 

The food, well we definitely had to get the saganake, I&#39;m not a big fan of it in general and found it to be on the salty side, but apparently that&#39;s how it is everywhere. The taramasalata with the fresh warm bread was amazing, get a large portion of that and they get a star alone for that. I also semi liked the grilled octopus hot appetizer as it was in a nice lemon sauce. We got the gyros entrees and they were okay, with a few slices of pita bread. It wasn&#39;t served hot which makes me wonder how long they were sitting out for. My friends got the entrees and they looked better than they gryos. I didn&#39;t even love the tiziki sauce, which come on, you have to get that sauce right if you&#39;re a Greek establishment. 

So overall, the service was good, our server was nice, but not necessarily always around. The food was good, decent, not incredible. I wish I had the carmel flan dessert as I saw it looked good but I was on the low carbs diet that evening, and after everything else, I felt like I&#39;ve swallowed enough calories. I&#39;m glad I tried it but it wasn&#39;t something I&#39;m a super fan of but if I was invited again for whatever reason, I probably would go again and devour a large portion of their taramasalata."

Mainly I say this because there are places that put together a slightly more sophisticated take on Greek food in Chicago.  Also, it is worth mentioning that I literally used to walk from my apartment to their location on Halsted and have been eating at their restaurants for some part of five decades at this point.  Why all the background?  Mainly because this is one of those Chicago food experiences that I will rework my agenda to ensure I have pretty much every time I make it back to the windy city.

Top picks:

Saganaki - seriously, flaming cheese with a shot of brandy before quenching it with the juice of a half lemon is pure genius.  The slightly crispy corners and sides combine with the gooey center to make pure joy on a sizzling platter.  I don&#39;t know how authentic it is but damn is it good!  I&#39;ve had this dish elsewhere and it always seems to fall a little short. 

Charcoal octopus - very simple dish that I cannot resist ordering every single visit.  At a minimum, as an appetizer although frequently as an entree.  I love the way that the lemon juice, olive oil and spices combine with the slightly charred finish on the remarkably tender octopus bites.  Perfection on a plate!

Baklava - bring a friend!  There is almost no chance you can eat this one by yourself.  Generally, a large slice of baklava sets off warning sirens with me - old, bland, dry - but not here.  They have a great baklava and they serve it in mammoth portions.

They serve lots of other dishes that I also enjoy but these three are the ones that make me change my agenda whenever I&#39;m in the area."

The price is right for the food and it&#39;s relatively fast service (which we like since we have to hurry back to work). It&#39;s an old diner, staff is friendly, but definitely not the greatest. This place is well-liked because it can get very busy. 
I think our server was having an off day. She kept forgetting some things and having to go back to get it---totally fine. She was nice about it and extremely apologetic. 
I ordered a burger meal (I like to try staple options to compare and see if I&#39;ll come back). I ordered the cheddar cheese on my burger and immediately regretted it when my food came out. It looks like they used the cheese from a nacho cheese machine to squirt it on my open-faced burger. I ate it cause I was so hungry, but I made a mental note to never order cheddar again. It would&#39;ve been nice to get a heads up or have some indication on the menu it&#39;s cheddar liquid. 
They accept credit cards, but their machine took forever to connect and you have to pay at the front on your own. Just an FYI if you&#39;re in a hurry."

My co-worker got the &#34;taco&#34; salad that had crab meat salad in it with a variety of fruit in a taco shell.  Looked fresh and really huge!  Got plenty of food for the money too.

Although coupons are in the monthly mailers, the are rather unnecessary if you go for the daily specials.  I know Monday is $1 burger night, and I think Tuesday is the $12.99 all-you-can-eat wing special.

Aesthetically, the place was remodel to look semi-classy, with olive colored booths and a beautiful stone counter at the front entrance.  Gone are all the tacky wall decorations, and in their place are plenty of flat screen televisions, all tuned to sports.  Only drawback is that the dining room is extremely dark.

Service has been polite and prompt on all visits, and they were very accommodating when it came to changing the channel on one of the televisions for us to watch a soccer match.  And on both visits, our table was visited by a member of management just to check in.

I am a fan to the $1 burger special.  It&#39;s actually a very decent sized patty, not at all what I was expecting for a dollar.  You can add extra toppings like cheese, chipolte mayo, and bacon for anywhere from $.25 to $1.  (They come with the standard lettuce, tomato, and raw onion.) As an appetizer, the truffle Parmesan onion rings are very tasty (you can get fries or tots done this way as well,) but I was not a fan of the truffle butter for dipping.

The wing special was a great deal as well.  For $12.99, you get all the wings you can heat, and a regular order of fries come with the first serving.  The bone-in wings were good-sized, and were favored over the boneless.  Perhaps it was the sauce we ordered on the boneless; it tasted a bit like burned garlic, which was very bitter.  We were easily able to swap them out for a different variety.  The sauce choices are very extensive."

Perfect! We paid about $14 for a bottle of moscato. It was great. 

The environment was pretty chill and we ordered the chicken nachos and they were pretty good. Nothing to write home about but they filled the craving. 

They had the hockey games on tv and other sports stuff too. The thing that rubbed me the wrong way was the manager I assume. He went around and told everyone they were closing probably 30 minutes before, which you know last call and all that. Then 10 till he was shutting off TVs and telling everyone to wrap it up and that they were closing soon. So we were waiting for our waitress to come and give us our check. We split the bill and she accidentally charged my friends card twice. So when that guy came around again saying they were closing we brought it to his attention and he just blurted out &#34;She ran the cards wrong then.&#34;...it was kind of mean and we felt bad for her. We knew it was an honest mistake and he kind of said it mean to her as well. 

All you had to say sir, was that it was a mistake and you&#39;d fix it. Don&#39;t shame the poor thing.

My husband had the ale house burger, which was layers of flavor from the cheddar cheese, bacon, onion straws &amp; BBQ sauce and a perfectly medium rare juicy hamburger. It was delicious and rivaled my fav burger place, Burger Antics.  Bulldog offers many combinations of unique burgers. I had the house chicken salad wrap.  Filled to the brim with crispy chicken, egg, bacon, tomatoes, cheese, greens, this was a tasty wrap and huge. The portions were plentiful and the taste was great on both sandwiches.

For us gluten free foodies, they have plenty of options and as a vegetarian I am able to find a lot to choose from. 
Bar seems happening, with lots of beers on tap, but haven&#39;t made it here beyond lunch hour!  
Service is great too.   Tell them you are in a hurry and you are out in a hurry!"

We went on a Saturday night and I ordered a cheeseburger as part of their special they have every Saturday night. It is a great deal and was delicious. My mom got the fish tacos which were very good for a change as well. The restaurant was crowded, but we had no problem getting a seat during the peak of the night. I was disappointed at how loud it was in the restaurant, even away from the bar. It was very cold in the building which made it hard to enjoy dinner."

I&#39;ve read other less than stellar reviews here, and I just figured I was lucky enough to not have experienced any problems. The past two times I&#39;ve been here (we usually end up here at least 1-2x a week), things haven&#39;t been the best. 

  The only reason my rating isn&#39;t lower is because the servers are usually pleasant and accommodating. However, when items consistently end up missing from your order, drinks end up not being full, and charges show up on your bill that do not make sense, the visit starts to get a little less fun. Again, I do not think the servers are at fault, but maybe the kitchen, bartenders, and manager need to coordinate together for an overall better experience for the customer."

A few things to note...
1-Super sticky floor under our table... I  mean super sticky
2-Waitress did not clear the dirty plates but came back twice looking to close out the check
3-Iced Tea is $2.50?? Seems a tad high for water and a tea bag. Also, they do bit have hot tea&#39;m.
4-Super cold inside on a rainy day"

The atmosphere is a good vibe for a chill relaxing date. We were never disappointed with the serve and the food. However, there takeout service is quite not so great.

My Mother my girlfriend and I had dinner at Bulldog last evening (1/2/16) around 5-6PM. We were seated by a friendly hostess but that is about where the positive experience ends. Petty as it may sound our waitress was not the friendliness person as I cannot recall if she smiled once and did not offer any form of chit chat being that she had to come back three times to take our beer orders since each other time we were either informed that the menu has changed or they were out of that particular beer.

For an appetizer we had the waffle bites and for an entree I had the Cajun Chicken Pasta. I have had this particular pasta dish before but boy was this the worst I have had. The chicken was dry, I did not taste a hint of cajun and it was served not hot but fairly warm. I should have said something at the time but for the sake of having a good time with my Mother and girlfriend before I went back to Chicago for school I figured I&#39;d let it go.

Being that Bulldog&#39;s was the only meal I had that day I cannot imagine what would cause the next experience I am about to reveal. Around 5:00AM this morning I woke up with a horrible pain in my stomach, and to save you all the details I have been in the bathroom ever since up until now. I have never in my life experience what I can only recall as some sort of food poisoning. Even now I still feel like I am about to be sick. 

Horrible experience and just to recap for everyone; unfriendly staff, not up to date menu, food served warm and lastly there has to be a dirty kitchen if I got this sick. 

Save yourself the trouble everyone and avoid this establishment."

This time Tuesday after work we had a double date. The first table we were sat at by the windows in the bar where they are building the patio had ANTS crawling all over the table, wall and window sill. We asked to be moved only to see that about 5 min after we moved they sat the same table again. Gross! The manager had told us that there was ants 2 weeks go but across the restaurant. Nasty! Service today was very slow. I honestly cannot recommend this restaurant in their current conditions. No way should they have bugs crawling all over it."

It is the best fish in the area that I have tried so far and it is good every time I have come here.  I have also tried the shrimp poboy which was ok but kind of stingy on the shrimp.

I went here on a Saturday afternoon and had the urge for a burger, well low and behold the deal of the day was a build your own burger.  I never even looked at the menu, I know that makes me a bad yelper.  Then I was informed that they had their own house beers and they were on special for $3 for a 24oz beer.  Because of this I never looked at the beer menu either.  The burger was great, cooked to perfection and served with some great fries.  The house beer I chose was similar to a Blue Moon and was pretty tasty, especially for $3.  Service was good and very efficient and the place was really nice inside.  They have a huge selection of beers on tap and next time I&#39;ll actually see what they are and crack open the food menu as well.

Got seated almost immediately.  Ordered drinks which were delivered pretty quickly.  From there on, it was a train wreck.  We ordered our food at 6:30pm.  At 6:55pm, our waitress stopped at the table and I inquired about the food being MIA.   Her response was that the other side of the restaurant was very busy.  That was BS because there were multiple empty tables and booths throughout the restaurant.  At 7:10. STILL NO FOOD!  A couple behind us, who came in 10 minutes AFTER we were seated, got both an appetizer and dinner while we sat there.  We attempted to get the attention of what appeared to be the manager yet, we were ignored.

A great tap selection and a good bar food menu.   Some favorites are the pizzas-Italian Beef is good-not much sauce, but good heat and their pizza crust is tasty.  Also, burgers are large and generous with the toppings.  Truffle fries are good-a must, as their fries aren&#39;t great by themselves.  The Caesar salad I had as a side was really good as well.

Service has been good both times and while there was a wait each time, they get people in and out without pushing you at the same time.

The second time I went on a Friday night and it was very busy. We were told it would be about 20-25 minutes for a table, but we ended up only waiting about 7 minutes so that was a nice surprise. We ordered the Korean taco appetizer. My fianc√© and I both just thought they were alright, but that we would not order them again.

We also love that coupons are constantly being sent out to us! Bulldog has specials every night (good
Drink and food specials) I love the burgers here, they all Come On pretzel buns which are my FAV! A few different options for fries too which makes things more exciting. I prefer the waffle fries, boyfriend likes the truffle fries....both are amazing!

Many, many beers on tap, this is another great place to come to watch a game and sit at the bar. I have yet to be here and have them be out of a beer we have requested.

The only bad thing I could say about bulldog is the service is not so great. We have never had that great of a waitress or bartender. In fact the last time we were here it was pretty obvious the bar tender was drunk. I think a better eye needs to be kept on the staff and then this would be a 5 star joint!"

My burger came out on a dirty plate so I pointed it out and asked for a new plate and new bottom bun. Instead of bringing the new plate with bun to me (so I could see they didn&#39;t just throw the whole burger on a new plate), they took it to the back. After it was brought back I looked at it and there was a very small amount or cheese, so I asked for another slice. They have to ring everything up before giving it to you so I was charged for it. It would have been a great way to say I am sorry about the dirty plate, but no. Then on the bill I saw I was charged for the &#34;free&#34; pickles I asked to have on the side. I told the MOD and he fixed it as he did the burger, but still left the cheese on there. I thought it was classless."

I had been to the one in Carol Stream and the burgers there were/are ridiculously good. We tried this Bulldog and the first 3 times we were there (in 2015), it was fantastic. Buttery pretzel rolls, (I assumed) hand-made patties, delicious, fresh toppings. Then, my husband and I went out for our anniversary (Nov, 2015)--we like it THAT much. We both love a good, tall beer and the burgers were always fantastic. But they weren&#39;t. We thought it was just us. So we went back again, this time with a group, all the while raving about this place. And bam, again. Bland, bad, frozen burgers, cold, stale bun. I called the manager over to ask if they had changed the type of burgers they served. He said he just started a month ago, and  they&#39;ve always been frozen patties brought it from somewhere since he has been there. I told him my good, past experiences with this Bulldog Ale House and he was less than sympathetic. In fact, he said, &#34;well, everyone is entitled to their opinion&#34; and walked away. No apology, no comped burger, no coupon for next time...nothing. This happened 5 months ago and we haven&#39;t been back since.

One the best burgers i&#39;ve had in a while. There seems to be a theme in the comments of people poo-pooing all over the other menu items so if you&#39;re unsure of what to order the burger is a safe bet. I happened to stop in on Monday which is $1 burger night, added a few extra toppings (big list to choose from) for a small upcharge. 

Poppers, I agree with another reviewer. They have too much snap to them. They should be fire roasted in the least before stuffing. That would only take a few seconds and would soften them up. They are served on a hotplate or what ever but that seems about the only cooking they receive. 

I got the Parmesan truffle fries and wifey got the waffle fries, The truffle fries where just meh but the waffle fries are really good. They serve them with a &#34;chipotle&#34; ketchup though I couldn&#39;t really taste anything chipotle about it. 

Waitress was quick and attentive.

He is friendly, talkative (not too much though) and above all is a bartender who tends to his bar. So many times it&#39;s hard to get good service sitting at the bar you don&#39;t have to worry about that if he&#39;s taking care of you. We will definitely be back."

My husband came on a Saturday night. The food was okay. It wasn&#39;t terrible but it wasn&#39;t great. The service was.. Interesting. My husband got two samples of their beers and the server just put them on the table and walked away without telling him which was which.. When our food came the server just placed the meals down - didn&#39;t ask whose was whose .. Which they were put down wrong.. Everyone was friendly though - just not trained well or enough. The Rumchata Bread Pudding was THE BEST thing by far we are - so worth the beer and bread pudding

Had a coupon for buy 1 get 1 free.  The coupon was valid for up to $7.00.  I don&#39;t think any of the entrees are anywhere near $7.00. 

First of all I ordered a cup of coffee.  After waiting 10 or so min. a different waitress brought it out.  I thought to myself, great a nice fresh brewed cup of hot coffee!  NOT!  It wasn&#39;t even warm.  I asked the waitress about it and she said she could bring me another cup.  I said a coke would be fine. I had a feeling the 2nd cup was going to be like the 1st. 

I ordered a steak salad that came with french fries on top.  I ordered the fries on the side.  I also ordered them crispy and they came out fine.  The salad came with a homemade ranch dressing.  The salad was fine but I can have a salad just as good at many places for the same amount or cheaper.  It was $11.49ish?  I asked if their salad dressing was homemade and our waitress said no.  The only homemade dressing was ranch and I believe they had a couple of varieties of ranch.  

My friend ordered a steak sandwich with waffle fries.  Waffle fries, onion rings, small salad etc. was a $1.99 up charge.  We both thought that was quite a bit for waffle fries.  The only thing that came with their sandwiches were regular fries or cole slaw.  Many of her waffle fries were clumped together so they were rawish in the center.  Her sandwich was fine but like I said you can get a comparable sandwich many places.  The waitress also brought her out another coke and it had the waitress hair on it so when she picked it up it touched her food.  So gross!!  

The manager came by and we told him our complaints, the coffee, the hair and fries but he didn&#39;t seem to care.  He told me he would make sure the coffee didn&#39;t end up on the bill.  

I didn&#39;t check out the bar but it looked amazing!  Lots of beer, wine and drinks!!"

Food was very good but the service and general disorganization of the staff was somewhat disconcerting.   My server Sarah O. was very nice but was not very attentive.  Maybe she was busy, maybe just a bad day but if her service was better I would have added another star.  Food: Pretzel appetizer was very good and the queso was perfect.  The Pulled Chicken Nachos were plentiful and tasty.

I was taken a back as I was leaving that there was quite a few folks waiting and I noticed several clean ready to be used tables in the dining room

Overall I look forward to m g next visit."

But we opted for some wings and entrees. The  wings were  pretty good,  not very spicy, very saucy. I wasnt in love with my pot roast I ordered, had an interesting tangy sauce that I wasnt diggin. My hubbys bourbon chicken was very tasty. Waitress forgot my soda, manager gave us one on the house. We got charged for an extra salad, didnt notice till after we paid, caused a huge debacle bc they voided it and then my card declined when they were running it through again.  You would think with these issues I would be rating lower, but the manager handled our issues very well, and  hey mistakes happen! Because of the great customer service we will be back.

Was really expecting a great burger after hearing high reviews of it. While we didn&#39;t have any issues with the service the food was just ok. I would say the highlight of our meal was the Appetizer platter. It was good but nothing that would make me drive out of my way to dine here. Would easily be 4 stars if they used fresh ingredients. Nothing tasted homemade. Atmosphere was nice though and they have potential. May just need some time to get in the grove."

The service is lacking though. Even other servers who dropped things off to our table weren&#39;t very attentive. Getting anything extra like napkins or a refill took awhile. We asked what looked like a manager for dessert plates and silverware but they never came. He walked by twice after and completely ignored us. Is it worth it for the food? Probably...but just be aware of what you are getting into.

The restaurant was crowded as the Hawks were playing.  We ordered drinks, appetizers and entrees.  We ordered the pulled chicken nachos.  The chicken was good but the cheese was hard by the time we received it.  Not sure how the chips were warm but the cheese had cooled and hardened.  Made it difficult to eat and I wouldn&#39;t recommend it. I ordered a steak sandwich and it was decent. They have quite a few items on the menu and nothing is very expensive.  Take advantage of the specials and you will get a great deal. The prices for beer and ciders on tap were great.  More reasonable than I anticipated.  The servers are all really friendly.

Working in the industry, and having been to many, many bars, I was pleasantly surprised by how many beers they had that neither I nor my boyfriend had heard of. If you&#39;re just looking for a great deal and don&#39;t care too much about trying something new, head to the bulldog on sunday, where you can get 32 oz draft of any of their domestics for $4-a freaking steal, especially on game day. If you can&#39;t decide between beer or a bloody mary, fret not; you don&#39;t have to choose. When you buy a bloody Mary it comes with a sidecar of beer. ANY beer that they have on draft. I love that. Other than beer, they also have food that was above your average bar food. I had a Chipotle black bean burger topped with guacamole, Jalape√±os, and tortilla strips, and it was just delicious. Service was prompt and efficient, though not friendly.  However the hostess bookended our experience with a sweet smile and warm greetings."

We receive coupons all the time for this place, but can rarely make use of them.  ANY modification to your order while trying to make use of a coupon will result in the coupon being invalid.  They are NOT willing to accommodate the customer. 

Although the food was edible, it was certainly nothing to write home about or wait a long time for.  Beware, if you want to substitute tater tots in place of fries, be prepared to shell out and additional  $2 for each plate.  That&#39;s a crime!  It should be the same cost for fries or tots - period. 

Although we pass this restaurant ALL THE TIME,  we just keep on moving past.  And that&#39;s too bad.  We had high hopes for this place, but have been disappointed all three times we went there.

There was no wait which was great, but sort of a bit concerning. We were greeted immediately upon entering and waited a couple of minutes to get the table together for the 9 of us. The waitress was very prompt when we arrived. Took all of our drink and appetizer orders. We had a couple people arrive late and she was prompt with them as well. We ordered the wings and fried pickles both were so dry there was no flavor to either of them. We placed our order, I ordered the grilled cheese panini and we also ordered a chicken wrap (I won&#39;t list all the others too many). The grilled cheese was so small and so dry. It was horrible. The waitress at this point didn&#39;t really pay attention to us so I had to scrape the cheese and bacon off with my fork to at least have something to eat. The chicken wrap was so bland, there was no flavor at all. I will mention Mom had the French dip, this did have flavor it was like a salt lick.  This was a very disappointing experience in regards to the food. Someone needs to look at the menu and revamp it."

Our server was awesome and food came out quick but I still struggle with their prices here. We finally ordered the loaded waffle fries as I think $10 for fries is rough. We were ensured by our server they were loaded and a large portion so we bit the bullet and ordered them. The large soup bowl came out with about 15 waffle fries and very little cheese and bacon. Kind of disappointed. The cheese that was there was hard and I&#39;m pretty sure the waffle fries are the ones you can buy at Costco. As goes with the boneless wings. Heavily breaded with very little meat. For a place in this area I would expect a little more. No reason anyone should serve frozen boneless wings at this point. I will say the sauces were good though and the alcohol specials are a good deal. I so want this place to be good as it&#39;s so close to our house but the food is a bit overpriced for bar food. Step it up a notch Bulldog...please!!

I pulled Yelp up and came across this place.  We walked in about 6:00 on Sunday. It was fairly crowded but not crazy.  There were a lot of families and big groups in the restaurant.  First thing my husband and I noticed were all the craft beer taps!!! There were probably 30 or so and they had some good beers (yes, I am a beer snob)!  We were seated right away and our server was at the table within 2 minutes after being seated.  She was pleasant and helpful.  It was .39 boneless chicken night so we ordered 25 to share between 3 of us.  We also ordered waffle fries with cheese and bacon to start.  It was way overpriced.  It wasn&#39;t a large portion, there was nothing expensive on it and it cost $9.00.  We won&#39;t order that again.  But, the .39 boneless wings were tasty and they had lots of sauces to choose from.  They are about the size of a McNugget so I&#39;m glad we ordered plenty.

First they made sure that there was enough fish for what we would possibly eat before we ordered, which was very nice of them. Our waitress never left us without refills or enough sauce for our fish.

Bad: The fact that they run their better red wines through chilled taps. Makes absolutely, no sense. Don&#39;t care if it is an Ale House. Red wine is not chilled to draft beer temperatures.

The mac &amp; cheese was probably frozen triangles dropped in a fryer.  It was edible.  The great thing about this place is the beer.

Recommend skipping this place. If your not a regular at the bar the staff forgets your there. Every time I come in and order there house beer it is always out VERY POOR MANAGEMENT. There drinks are very weak more mix than Vodka. We waited 15 minutes before we were asked we would like to order. Do your self a favor DO NOT WASTE your time or money on the dive the service sucks if your not a regular customer very unfriendly bartender staff. In a word this place SUCKS

The pizza by the slice or the pie (think manhole cover sized), buffalo wings, Stromboli&#39;s, sandwiches and just about everything else on the menu is good. Just remember that it is bar food so do not expect something you pay too much money for elsewhere just because you are paying for their name. This place knows what they can do well and they just do it. 

Since I don&#39;t drink, I can only say this about their beer choices: if you don&#39;t find something you like, you are in the wrong place. Their beer list is easily over 90 beers in bottles, cans and draft. The bartenders are some of the friendliest anywhere. They remember what my wife likes, a shot of Tequila and a bottle of Stella in a mug, and have it up and on the bar as soon as they see us walk in.  

Prices? Very reasonable. I go for lunch, two slices of pizza and water (told you I didn&#39;t drink) and walk out for less than $7.00. Dinner, add a salad and some of their various appetizers and a slice for my wife and we are very satisfied.

Two secrets
1) If they have chili available and you enjoy chili, try it. You won&#39;t be sorry, I promise. 
2) If you like deserts, try their chocolate cake."

There is plenty of seating and an area to play bags.  The inside is typical of a neighborhood bar, it&#39;s comfortable and a decent spot to gather and drink a beer.  There are plenty of TVs if you want to keep your eye on the score too.  The second time I came here, my friend watched the Cubs game while I glanced up at a re-run of &#39;Real Housewives of New York&#39; - ideal!

The Pineapple IPA is the best beer I&#39;ve had so far this season.  I&#39;ve forgotten the brewery name, but when I came back a week later it was still on their draft list.  The Sweetwater Blue is another good summertime beer with a distinct blueberry flavor.

The food is pretty good.  The macaroni &amp; cheese bites are a must!  I tried the stromboli too (the &#34;domboli&#34; with steak, mushrooms, and white cheddar).  It&#39;s a hearty portion and was pretty tasty, but I did have a rumbly tummy after eating that (I noticed another review said the same of the buffalo chicken).  These might be a little grease-heavy.

Parking is available once you find the gravel path off of the one-way street.  There is no parking alongside the building and good luck getting out of the lot if you accidentally turn into it.  Some signage about parking would help a lot."

If you are looking for a good beer selection I would recommend this place although it&#39;s hard to pass up the taphouse next door. Food is terrible and the prices are way to high for what you get. Last night the special was a slice and side salad for $6 (Regular price is $7 so not much of a deal) the slice was one of the worst I have ever had. It was extremely soggy and tasted like it was made that morning and just re heated. The side salad was small and the lettuce was not very fresh. Service was good but that could be because we were sitting at the bar. I&#39;ll definitely be back but not for the food.

They were good except... The two appetizers came out AFTER our dinner (which were made incorrectly.)When we were served our dinners, I mentioned to the waitress that we hadn&#39;t gotten our apps. We didn&#39;t end up getting them until we had already finished. Additionally, I received green olives instead of the black ones I had actually ordered. 

We were surprised to get the bill and see we were charged full price for all of it. When we approached the counter and asked to speak with someone regarding the matter, the manager WALKED AWAY instead of resolving it. To our surprise it took three other individuals and quite some time to correct the bill. We were by no means rude or impatient, just wanted to correct the issue. The manager, however, could be heard telling the cooks to, &#34;get them the f*** out of here. F*** &#39;em!&#34; I couldn&#39;t believe it! The rest of the staff was helpful  and the waitress was apologetic. I want to reiterate that we were not mean or unkind, or short tempered, or loud, or even expecting anything other than acknowledgement and to help fix it for future customers. We left a nice tip for the hard working waitress, but will not return because of such awful customer service from the &#34;manager.&#34;"

So much so, in fact, that the three times I&#39;ve eaten it I had weird poopies, but I still order it. That comment speaks more towards my weak stomach and not toward the quality of food, by the way. And, for the record, I have now switched to eating pepperoni stromboli just to give it a rest. It&#39;s a huge portion for $9. All calzones are just as immense.

Pizza dough is delicious. Beer choices are vast. Servers are, for the most part, helpful. My biggest critique would be that servers seem to not write anything down. I ordered a side salad but because our server couldn&#39;t remember 10+ things, understandably, it didn&#39;t come. They could be making more money by just throwing a pen and paper into the mix when you are taking orders for a table of four.

The food was ok at best.  The meal was very expensive for what you got and the meat was dry.  To make matters worse absolutely no BBQ sauce was served with the meat.

We opted for burgers (which are also pretty massive) and it was a good move! We both had the Hazmat burger. Mmm, mmm! Super tasty and you can never go wrong with bacon. I thought it was fun that they used a croissant bun. It was a first for me and I liked it.

Great beer selection. It has several favorites and a few I hadn&#39;t heard of before. I&#39;ve been away from IL for a few years, so maybe I&#39;m behind on my local, midwest beers. We both really enjoyed our beers, and you could pretty much throw a dart at the menu and hit something you&#39;ll like.

I&#39;ll go again, this time with my fiance and dad also so we can tackle a pizza.

Plenty of parking around back, even though you can&#39;t tell from just driving by. Very friendly staff and a nice firehouse theme. Once the weather warms up, they&#39;ll probably open up the big patio in the back."

Very cool interior&#39; decorated like an old fire house.  But there were several flies swarming around on the night we were here, and the floor and tables looked like they hadn&#39;t been wiped down in quite some time.

The service was okay; nothing spectacular.  I was please with their beer list as they had Three Floyd&#39;s and Revolution on tap.  I ordered a salad and the bf ordered an appetizer of chicken fingers because he wanted to try the spicy wing sauce with them.  Then we were going to split a calzone.  Pizzas only come in one size, 18&#34;, which we decided was too big for just the two of us.

My salad was fine; nothing special.  Chicken fingers were pretty heavily breaded, and we ended up being charged an extra 50 cents for the sauce substitution-minor detail, but annoying.  Our calzone came out at the same time as our salad and appetizer--also minor, but annoying.  

The bf freaked out when he realized that his nemesis, ricotta cheese, was included in the calzone.  It did say that on the menu, we just happened to overlook it, so that was a mistake on our part.  Luckily, they sell pizza by the slice here, so he was able to order a slice of pizza to have instead, once we were able to track down our waitress.  NY style pizza, nothing fancy.  Crumbled sausage, fresh mushrooms (not canned), which was good.

Overall, we were a bit disappointed, and I don&#39;t think we would return, unless we had a much larger group so we could order and share multiple pizzas."

Unassuming from the front.  When you go in you are greeted with 5 tvs behind the bar,  perfect for game day.  

The outdoor seating is awesome and in the back.  They have bands, cornhole,  and a huge TV.  

The best part aside from awesome burgers and apps is the 90+ beers they have! Yeah I said 90...they give tap house grill a run for their money.  

This is my new favorite summer place to hang!"

For a place that prides itself with  &#34;pizza&#34; in the title, the pizzas are large but quite inferior. The taste is mediocre. The sauce and crust leave much room for improvement. This place could truly be great as it&#39;s a great location, cozy place with outside patio. I would love to see it improve."

I used to live in New Jersey and it definitely seemed to me like a New York pie.  My wife always prefers Chicago pizza - those with more cheese and more tomato sauce.  For me, the pizza was worth it.  In other reviews you&#39;ll read that the dough is undercooked - you can ask for well done crust.  Yes, the service was slower than I would have liked, but for me, it was fine because I was with good company.  What I liked about it is that the wings and the pizza had that original, fresh cooked real flavor, not the franchise box &#39;everything is the same&#39; taste and feel to it.  I liked it because it&#39;s not a chain restaurant.
There is another review about the pizza being greasy.  Ours was emphatically not greasy.  Next time I go, I&#39;ll keep an eye out - I&#39;ve only been there once so far, but will definitely go again."

Outer edge crust of pizza too thick and has absolutely no flavor.  Left it on the plate.  Center crust of pizza very under cooked and still doughy.  Only positive thing in menu side us the huge 32 oz. NA drinks.

Needs some sound deadening materials in the dining area.  Concrete floors don&#39;t help.  Music too damn loud, making hard to hear wait staff much less your dining partners.  Back garage door open to patio with temps in the 50s doesn&#39;t make for a pleasant experience.

If this place is busy, expect a considerable wait for your food.

Mark this as a place I won&#39;t be frequenting."

(In part because I believe they borrowed $130,000 from Oswego to do some work to the property and I would love to see that get paid back...)

The set up:
I went on a Thursday night. The patio was mostly full and the main restaurant was mostly empty. 

On Entry:
No greeting, the Front half was empty and I stand there for a bit until someone in the kitchen asked if they can help me. I felt like I should have known to just walk to the back of the place. 

Service:
Kinda slow, I sat down at 7:50 and did not get my Pizza until 8:45. This was a combination of the pizza taking a while to make and the server not taking my order for a while. I did get a Platter appetizer that came out fairly quickly after I ordered it. Drink refills were lacking.

Food:
My app platter had some rather dry and hard Pretzels on it, Bread sticks were good. Poppers/Mozzarella sticks were your normal heat and eat. Overall I felt it had a high price for what it was and it was not that great. At first I thought the price for the Pizza was high, after I saw it, I no longer felt that way, as it was rather large. That said, I really needed a drink re-fill to eat it. It had this amazing ability to suck your mouth dry. The dry crust and what I can only explain as extra flour coating were to blame. My wife and I could not finish our first slice without dunking it. It tasted okay, but the dryness was overbearing(maybe its a New York thing?). My kids ate the topping but not the crust. 

Overall, I wish them luck, I like to see a small town place do well, but we wont be back. 

Some Redemption: 
The next day I had some cold leftovers, it inexplicably tasted better and since the crust had some time to absorb moisture from the refrigerator, it was better! I did finish it all over the next two days."

We started with some pretzel bites and an order of jalape√±o poppers both were great. We ordered a sausage and mushroom pizza and 10 wings. We were so surprised that they would have such good pizza in a town so for out of the city. It was delicious. Fresh mushrooms and delicious sausage tasty crust  and really good sauce. Tastes like my mom would make it homemade. Straight from an Italian Kitchen. The wings were awesome and they had all kinds of craft beer selections. It&#39;s a ma and pa atmosphere which we love. We will be back probably many times.

The other poor reviews pretty well sum up our experience there. The pizza truly is tasteless...in a &#34;how is this possible?&#34; sort of way. And REALLY greasy...yuk.

Let&#39;s start with the positives, The Jalapeno Popper Pizza was Orgasmic, The crunchy crust loads of Mozzarella and Cheddar, real strips of bacon and hot jalapeno made my tummy happy. 

The do have a decent beer list, lots of safe picks and some beers I have never had!

We came on a Wednesday night and it was full but we sat ourselves and were served quickly. She was attentive and friendly. 

The place has tasteful decor touches, and is very clean, The brass fire extinguishers for lights above the bar are nice. Comfy seating, lots of t.vs,  great place to watch a game. 

Negative Nancy says: 
 The menu is limited, and what we ordered was not on it, we saw it on another table, and took a chance, they do not even list what toppings they offer!  Obviously we don&#39;t eat based on price alone, but had no idea what it would cost. 

I know I am kinda a beer snob but most the list was bottles, and I am weary of a 50 plus list of craft beers as they have a tendency to sit for to long and get skunk,  8.50 for a draft beer is outrageous!!!!! They also did not give you any more information then the name of the beer. Bad Form."

The  place is tiny, but has a great patio in the back. Parking is scarce. Nice fireplaces in the winter, but the front area is almost useless, as most people filter to the rear or patio. Great beer selection. Service is sort of slow, but it&#39;s a slow tiny town. Appetizers are your run of the mill frozen fried apps, so nothing special there. The pizza is pretty good however, and worth the visit. It does  take a while to get. My complaint is that there is only one size, and its HUGE! Two people can barely eat half a pizza.  It appears to be a Brickoven baked pizza, and the crust is nice and crispy vs sloppy gross NY style.

What is deep dish? That&#39;s not pizza.&#34; So my neighbor recommended firehouse in Downtown Oswego and said thats the closest were gonna get to New York style pizza. I liked it but my husband says its still not the real thing. You can order a large pizza for 22 bucks or you can order it by the slice. The slices are pretty big and they are good. I tasted a lot of garlic in the sauce which is definitely a plus for me. The atmosphere was very casual. The place looks like a pub where old, retired firemen go to eat and drink. They have TVs everywhere and the music is very loud. They have two different seating areas. The front is more quiet and for people who wanna get in and get out. The back area is the louder area with the bar. Our servers were nice and as quick as they could be. There were a lot of people there (it was a friday around 5ish). We also ordered the breadsticks which are homeade. I wouldnt recommend them. They tasted and looked like funnel cake without the powdered sugar. They also have a menu that, aside from pizza, offers cheeseburgers and other types of bar food. Overall, it was a neat place with decent pizza."

I had seen this place for a while in downtown Oswego but had not thought of stopping by but with a head full of Tom Cruise I was feeling adventurous.

Let me start by giving a complement - this place is a dive.  But in the best use of the term.  The staff was very friendly, the setting was like someone converted their garage into a bar and grill (and from what I could see that&#39;s almost exactly what happened.  It does not have the sterile, over rehearsed feel of the chains and...the food is pretty good.

Let&#39;s talk pizza.  They do a NY style za in only one size - HUGE.  Now you have to be a fan of fold-up pizza but they do it right.  Of course if you don&#39;t feel you can down five pounds of pizza they will whip up a slice of your choosing.  I had a slice of sausage and was not disappointed.  Although I prefer chunks of sausage this is a crumbled kind of place (hence NY style).  At $3.50 for a single slice and two for $6.00 the portion is way more than generous.  The base red sauce was just a little on the sweet side to my taste but the abundance of cheese made up for it.  Over all i enjoyed the pizza and would not hesitate to order it again.

I also had a 10 piece order of their wings in the medium spicy Asian sauce.  The wings are deep fried with a dusting of flour so you get a crunchy result without getting soggy breading a la Hooters.  The wings were well coated but not served in a soup of sauce - big bonus in my book.  I also liked that the celery and blue cheese dressing was included - again, well done!  had I been dining alone I would have gone for one of their hotter sauces and I look forward to doing that on my next visit.

My wife had the mushroom Swiss burger which was cooked to YOUR desired doneness and hand formed.  I took a proffered taste from my sweetie and found the burger to be delicious. They use a unique hybrid of hamburger/ croissant bun which was very tender yet hearty enough to handle the juiciness of the burger.  I could easily make this my new burger joint.

We finished off with the cinnamon ties - and DO NOT leave before you have an order.  These are strips of pizza dough tied in a simple knot and deep fried.  I am well aware of the fried dough desserts all pizza places offer but, trust me, these are different.  The had a light texture packed with sugar and cinnamon and jam-your-mouth-full tasty.  If there had been a side of glaze to dip i would have been a dead man.

There are some minor downsides. The parking is not well marked and you can easily end up driving around the block to find yourself going the wrong way on a one-way alley.  The interior has an unfinished feel about it and the slate floor looks like it&#39;s dirty in need of mopping, but it&#39;s really just the maroonish color that shows every bit of detritus.

The menu has a lot of variety in both za and sandwiches. There is a bar area and a large (70+) selection of bottled imports and craft brews.  The place is stuffed with flat screens on a variety of sporting events so it is a little noisy - but HEY!  It&#39;s a pizza dive!  The prices are reasonable, my wife and I came away with about $35.00 including tip and sodas.

I am recommending this place on two levels, first - it&#39;s good food at a good price with a fun atmosphere.

Second -= IT&#39;S NOT A CHAIN!  Support this place, you will not be disappointed!"

This weekend was my first chance to go back since they&#39;ve been open to the public and to see how things are.  The place is not very big, they have a front section with regular tables and then a back bar area with higher tables.  The food that I&#39;ve tried here has been excellent, both at the soft open and over the weekend.  This trip I went for the simple pizza slice and some breadsticks and both were great.  The pizza is NY style, very cheesy, giant floppy slices that extend over the edges of the plate.  The breadsticks are also not to be missed, they taste like Little Caesars crazy bread that someone deep fried.  They have a nice crust on them, but be aware, they are pretty garlicy.  I look forward to trying some of their other items, I&#39;m told the burger is very good and I look forward to finding out.  My only ding on the place was that the service was just okay, it wasn&#39;t horrible, but it wasn&#39;t great either. They have a pretty nice beer selection and an outdoor patio.

I ordered my usual &#34;slice of pizza&#34; which arrived cold. It was replaced but the second one was burned. The third replacement obviously came from the same as the second since it was just as crisp. At this point someone from the kitchen came to our table and said that&#39;s the way their pizza is served. Funny, it wasn&#39;t that way the first two times. My wife ordered the Meatball Sandwich. It was  obviously a re-heated frozen meatball that was VERY dry. To top it all off WE had to go to the order window to get a drink refill since the server never returned to our table. All in all an unpleasant dining experience. Better pizza at Uncle Lars in Plano!"

It&#39;s a small place, but very typical of the pizza joints you&#39;d find in my Dad&#39;s old neighborhood in Brooklyn. The menu is extensive, but if you are looking for traditional NY style pizza, you found it. Slices are pie shaped and you eat it the traditional way...fold it in half.It is obvious from other reviews Chicagoin&#39;s don&#39;t understand good NY pizza!!! Pizza&#39;s are HUGE, and at first appear expensive...but they aren&#39;t for the amount of food and qualty you get, You can also buy pizza by the slice for $3.50...day or night. It&#39;s a good deal!! Friends have ordered sandwiches off the menu...all got rave reviews. My favorite appetizer...the Chief Chips!! Yummy!!

I have seen complaints on the service, I have had nothing but great service everytime I&#39;m there. I love the back deck with the big screen TV outback to watch games.

If you&#39;re looking for a fun local place to come hang out, get some good food and watch a game...this is the place!! So happy to have found this place!"

The atmosphere was fun, and there were authentic fire-house items hanging all around. This place receives full marks for the pizza. The portions are huge and very tasty. I had to leave off a star for service. We were placed by the door in the back, and every time somebody entered in the back (every minute), we were treated to an icy blast of air. Next time, I&#39;m going to ask to sit in the front. The food and drinks took a long time to get to us, as the service was pretty slow. I chalk this up to the staff getting used to working in a new place."

I was told &#34;yes&#34;.

Once we got there and sat down, I saw they had no kids menu. And no crayons. And no kids cups. How is this kid friendly? I ordered 2 chocolate milks for the two year olds and they arrived from the clueless waitress in GIGANTIC styrofoam cups that had to be 24 ounces.

My mom asked if the Bloody Marys were made with tomato juice or a mix, the waitress said tomato juice. And guess what? She ended up with a Bloody Mary mix drink that was way too spicy.

My husband ordered a summer shandy on tap and it was flat.

At this point we decided to pay for our drinks and leave to go eat somewhere else. We told our waitress this and she went to get our check without asking what was wrong.
As she was preparing our check, we saw her quietly telling the owner/manager that she didn&#39;t know why we wanted to leave. The owner/manager looked over at us and didn&#39;t even come over and talk to us.

Don&#39;t waste your time with this place. I will never be going back."

Since it was only my wife and I, we decided to order slices rather than the whole pie.  My wife is from the east coast and claimed this was the best New York style pizza she&#39;s had in Illinois.  The ingredients were fresh and the pizza was well prepared.  We also ordered 10 BBQ garlic wings.  They were good, but nothing to write home about.

Drink-  Can&#39;t really comment on taste since we didn&#39;t order any drinks, but their beer menu was huge!  I was definitely surprised to see how many options were provided in such a small place.

Service-  Our server and what we assumed was the female manager were great.  They were very attentive and super friendly.  

Other-  Parking is a little tight, but there&#39;s tons of spots on the street.  Of course that requires us to walk about a 1/2 block, but that&#39;s really no big deal.  Inside they have a ton of TVs which was great for the Blackhawks&#39; game.  

Conclusion-  My wife and I plan on coming back soon.  The food was great, service was friendly, and it had a fun atmosphere.  Glad to have two good restaurants in downtown Oswego!"

We arrived just before 7pm and put our name down as there was a twenty minute wait. No big deal, and definitely to be expected on a Saturday. I don&#39;t mind waiting typically I&#39;ll just grab a beer or drink at the bar, but don&#39;t bother with that this place is so small if they&#39;re business there is no place to stand and wait....We got sat after about 30 minutes of waiting, which again wasn&#39;t a big deal. Our server came over, clearly her first serving job, and asked &#34;what drinks would you guys like&#34; and we asked if there were any specials for the night. She responded, &#34;No drink specials, but there is a food special, any appetizer, pizza, and cinnamon sugar knots (they&#39;re dessert) for $21&#34;. Each couple ordered the special and we also were drinking beers. Appetizers took 35 minutes to get delivered and were typical frozen appetizers that were flavorless... oh well it&#39;s a pizza joint and I came to try the pizza. We received the pizzas and they are HUGE but that was the only good thing about it. Very greasy, overly cheesed, and generic pizza. Nothing about it stood out or would bring us back. Cinnamon knots.... I&#39;m not even going to waste my time with this failed attempt at a dessert. We then asked our server for our checks into the three couples. Our checks came back and without looking at the tab I just paid the bill....BAD MOVE. I then went to sign and for my wife and I we, by their math, managed a $60 tab.... not so much. Told the server to please adjust the amount. Check came back a second time, then all three tabs were wrong. Next try, the checks come back and now all of us were charged $26-$27 for our $23 pizza special. My wife then took the check up to the man near the register and explained our concern and that this would be the fourth revision to our check. He explained well it&#39;s my computer that over charged you and I can&#39;t do anything. Finally he said he would try and fix the checks to make them reflect the special. The checks come back the fourth time and were yet again wrong. We hand them back to the server and she hands them to the man at the register and he says &#34;What now?!&#34; My buddy went to talk to the man at the register and asked to speak with a manager.....and you&#39;ll never guess..... the man at the register was the owner....WHAT?!?! This is your new restaurant and this is how you treat your customers? Not only did he not offer to fix the checks and apologize for the poor service. He stood behind the counter with an attitude. Seriously? This place is not worth your time, effort, or money. I really wanted to see this place be great but we won&#39;t be going back....ever."

1. Horrible parking. If you can&#39;t park on the side, good luck in the back. Gravel, no defined parking spots. It&#39;s a free for all. 
2. Small. Like the other gentleman said in his review, waiting for a table is not easy there. There is a small bar, but there is literally no room. Until we snagged a seat at the bar, I felt like I was intruding on other diners. And once I did sit, I felt intruded upon when waiting customers were hovering next to my table. 
3. Limited menu. I went last week and they still had their limited menu. They had been open about two months at this point.Plenty of time to have your act together.  
4. Basic waiter/waitress skills. Everyone needs silverwear and napkins, or at least just napkins. Why not bring them out at the beginning? I shouldn&#39;t wait five minutes while my food gets cold. 
5. Staff crawling all over each other. We actually had a really good bartender, so that was my one plus (get out while you can, man). But some other dude kept coming back and second-guessing him. Same dude asked me if I wanted another drink. I answered in the affirmative. He took my glass and never came back. Sigh. 
6. The pizza. Humongous ... a good value. But greasy and tasteless. And on a paper plate. Was I at a restaurant or a carnival? 
7. Ventilation system. The fire smelled good for a while but then got overwhelming and my hair smelled disgusting when I got home. 

Finally, they had a problem with our check. Had to run my friend&#39;s CC twice. I certainly hope they can pick it up. If I ever go there again (doubtful), I will update my review."

Loved the crust, you will too if you are a NY style fan. Greek fries were outstanding/different. Summer Shandy on tap, in a mason jar, is always a bonus, and waitress recommended an outstanding microbrew (Lost Coast something er other)  While I see where this has been labeled unfriendly to kids (no milk, kids cups, or real kid menu) my 4 yr old loved the lemonade, the bags out back, and the cheese pizza which is a great value at $6 for two HUGE slices.  Go when the weather is nice, sit on the patio, let the kids run around, and be happy that you are supporting a new, different business in downtown OTown."

To the complaints below, this is still a relatively new place with waiters and cooking staff that is still getting used to the menu (hence the limited menu). It IS a rather small place and the lack of real plates is a little off-putting, but beyond that I don&#39;t have any complaints. They gave us large glasses for our drinks, the pizza was both cheap, huge, and delicious, and the serving staff was very friendly! I will be ordering from here again tonight with my buddies."

The side of this strip mall that often gets bypassed since the Food for Less shut its doors.  Come to the Lily Cache side and be sure to hit up the Doggie Diner.

The menu is unbelievably massive for such a tiny carryout joint.  It includes, but is not limited to:  Italian Beef, sausage(brats, Italian, and Polish), hot dogs, hamburgers, gyros, chicken sandwiches, subs, pizza puffs, ribs, tamale boats, chili dogs, and a ton more.

I love the gyro, and one day a week , they have a 2/$8 special that comes with two gyros, fries, and drinks.  Their fries are super stick thin and crispy.  Pizza puffs are the frozen variety, but taste really good coming out of the deep fryer.  

Service is counter-style, and the guys behind the counter are funny and engaging.  With so many things to try, this place definitely has a return customer with me!"

The menu is huge. You can get hot dogs, hamburger, subs, gyros, meatball subs, philly cheese steaks and many other sandwiches here. They have a bunch of different fried potato options like french fries, steak fries, greek fries, etc. Even their salads are pretty good.

The best thing is that they are usually pretty fast even when busy, and they have  very reasonable daily specials."

The food was decent but a little expensive in my opinion. My love ordered the chicken tenders meal and I ordered the gyros plate. 
My love thought the tenders were okay but nothing spectacular. My gyro was fantasy! The guy was right, you can make two gyros from the meat in the gyros plate! I was stuffed. Now for the bad part... dun dun dun! The fries were cold and tasted slight uncooked :( and my dearest raved about how good their fries are only to be disappointed.

The au jus was also nice to add from the separate container I ordered.   I also tried the Gyro plate.  I have a very hearty appetite, but couldn&#39;t finish it because they give you a lot of meat on the plate vs the regular sandwich.  The seasoned fries are quite good when hot and fresh.

The cheeseburger did not have a typical taste. Typically a cheeseburger will attempt to fill me up. This one tasted more like a veggie burger, very light, little flavor, and not filling at all.

The hotdog also did not taste typical. It was undercooked, and left you wondering what was in it - pork, beef, or what?

The inside is beautiful reminds me of some fine dining restaurants in the city very upscale. I had the scotch egg, oxtail, tartar, and rillete ended the dinner with the chocolate cake. As far as flavor goes everything was delicious the scotch egg was probably my favorite never had anything like it before it blew my mind. As for the oxtail it was my main course the meat fell off the bone it was cooked beautifully.  Since I was trying all kinds of new things I had the tartar never thought I would like tartar but it was excellent and the presentation of all the dishes was beautiful. I enjoyed my time at The Craftsman and will be returning soon to try some other items on the menu

His was one of the best restaurants I have ever had dinner or breakfast at. The chef defiantly knew what they were doing! I would defiantly know good food too I dated an amazing chef for two years of my life."

I feel like two stars is generous, as the experience was such a disaster. We wanted to eat at the restaurant, which I guess is different from the sandwich place on the first floor? Anyway, we go to walk upstairs and are stopped by the host who told us we had to put our name down, which is where everything went off the rails.

Absolutely no one could tell us how long the wait would be. The whole reason we committed to hanging around was because they said it&#39;d be maybe 15-20 minutes since we were just a party of two and they could squeeze us in. I grab a beer at the downstairs bar, which is different from the upstairs bar, but they only had a small selection of Two Brothers beer? Odd, but, whatever, I can drink a beer while we wait.

15-20 minutes come and go, and I go ask the totally different people who are manning the host stand. They had no estimate beyond &#34;It shouldn&#39;t be too much longer.&#34; I ask, &#34;OK, should I get another beer or do you mean it&#39;ll be ready in just a moment?&#34; They go check, and say I should get another beer as it&#39;ll probably be another half hour. We&#39;d waited this long, so, I guess what&#39;s a little longer?

An hour after we arrived, I went up and asked again, still no solid estimate beyond &#34;real soon.&#34; At this point we were really passing the point of no return, as once you&#39;ve invested an hour waiting for a table, you might as well just keep waiting. Another half hour passes, and I go up to the host and am just like &#34;Go ahead and cancel us, we&#39;re going somewhere else,&#34; as I was starting to get a headache as I had skipped lunch that day. As soon as we say we&#39;re going to leave, they suddenly have a table open for us.

We go upstairs, and HALF THE DINING ROOM IS EMPTY! With annoyance at sky high levels, I figured what the hell, we&#39;re here, let&#39;s try to enjoy it.

The menu at The Craftsman is super wacky, like they&#39;re going out of their way to awkwardly do fine dining in a place that still feels like a bar. We got a charcuterie board which was very expensive for how little we got, and looking around at what people were having comparing portion sizing to menu pricing, I just said screw it and ordered a burger which took forever to come out and was cooked wrong but at this point I&#39;d waited so long I would have eaten my shoe if they gave me a little ketchup.

It&#39;s really pretty incredible how much our expectations of The Craftsman differed from reality. I was expecting a nicer tap house, in downtown Naperville. Instead, we got a weird mish-mosh of restaurants, bars, a sandwich place, a coffee house, and other stuff confusingly smashed under one roof while somehow not having the whole Two Brothers beer lineup?

I don&#39;t get it."

Downstairs is a unique coffee and sandwich niche, and upstairs is an intimate dining room. We ate upstairs, which is beautifully decorated and pretty hip. Oddly, there is a hostess at the bottom of the stairs who is poorly trained and doesn&#39;t know how to direct people upstairs to actually be seated. Strange. We had a reservation and were finally seated in a little nook in the back. Our waiter was excellent - well versed in the menu and made it all sound awesome.

Bonus- the Two Brother&#39;s beer is served in an ENORMOUS glass and is SUPER cheap!

Sad news - the food is really mediocre and rather expensive. I&#39;m not above spending a little dough for a great meal, but while everything on the menu sounded exquisite, it was just heavy, midwestern food of regular quality. The squash soup was cheesy and too thick. That&#39;s weird. The small plates are indeed insanely small and very expensive. And cheesy, in ways that cheese should not be present. The chicken was okay, but again, super heavy and greasy, served with a heavy oily side. This makes me very sad! I would be delighted to come again if the menu was lightened up and freshened, which it sorely needs."

Man, was I disappointed that being a Two Brothers branded restaurant that they had a super limited selected of their beers and other craft beers. The menu online was for the downstairs? Upstairs? I don&#39;t know, it is confusing but I guess I drank at Third Floor?

How do you guys not have on tap/bottled available the following: Northwind Imperial Stout, Outlaw 2.0, Atom Smasher, Heavy Handed, Dog Days, Hop Centric, Monarch or Cane and Ebel??? They were pretty pumped that Revelry just was tapped but being a feed from their brewery it was severely disappointing and then really expensive. 

Better off going to Jimmys for a better Two Brothers selection or better yet the local Binny&#39;s. Two Brothers connection? Hardly noticed from my side. Skip it or wait until they get their own beers over there."

We just had dinner at the Craftsman and I want to give you a flavor of the multiple options available.  But first, kudos to Two Brothers for their creativity in a challenging vertical footprint in downtown Naperville.  

The first floor is a high end walk up market cafe with limited seating.  Smoothie bar, coffee bar and sandwich bar where the standard lunch offering goes for about $9.  I&#39;ll come back and try this out.

On the second floor is their dining room.  The menu is &#34;farm to table&#34; focusing on offerings from the tri-state region.  The menu is creative.  That&#39;s the good news.  The bad news is the price points are high for small serving sizes.  $17 for a hamburger.  Really?  $17 for a medium sized serving of pasta?  And, if you want a salad with either of these --- that&#39;s extra.  My instincts are I will not be a repeat visitor to the 2nd floor.  

The 3rd floor looks inviting and I&#39;ll be back for that.  They&#39;ve got a creative menu of drinks with prices around $12.  They also serve a number of tapas plates on the 3rd floor.  AND, they&#39;ve got outdoor seating.  Looks nice!!

So, overall, the jury&#39;s still out.  Creative menu, but pricey for what you get on the 2nd floor.  First floor and third floor -- I&#39;ll come back to sample those."

Drinks were OK at best. Manhattan &amp; Old Fashion were too syrupy, to the point the bourbon was lost  

Had to send the Cheese appetizer back the first time. Described as &#34;WARM Burrata Cheese, Marinara, Black Sea Salt, Olive Oil, Grilled Crostini&#34; - it came out literally COLD. On the second attempt the kitchen sent us a plate that can only be described as lukewarm at besThe manager did come by our table and apologize for the trouble and didn&#39;t charge us for either one, which was nice but expected at that point. 

Oxtail Ravioli were ok - the candied walnuts overwhelmed the rest of the sauce. Bolognese was lack luster, if that. Pasta was great, but the meat sauce was a complete failure.  Both were tremendously overpriced for the serving size &amp; quality. 

It would appear on the surface that this new establishment is struggling with its identity and really needs to focus on doing a few things spot on instead of a little of everything with some mediocrity.  Hope they can figure it out."

Our server Sam was very good.  Someone else already described the space as cold, which I agree with.  It is relatively sparse.
The 3rd floor bar is a gem.  The cocktail menu is the best in Naperville and the space is cozy and comfortable.  Our server, Kevin, was fantastic.

Turns out they weren&#39;t serving lunch, but breakfast (brunch). Was quite surprised that even at 1 in the afternoon it was only brunch options. Regardless, the food is the only thing that really saves this review: Four stars for food. The two 14 year olds that we brought with us liked the food, even when they got stuff they had never heard of/had before (like truffle oil egg sandwich). Everyone finished everything except for one person in our group. That&#39;s where the trouble starts...one person ordered the french toast. We saw the table next to us have some trouble with their order of the same thing when the waitress told the guy next to us that the kitchen was out of sausage so he could only have bacon with his french toast. I could tell that guy was kind of bummed. 
So 40 minutes go by waiting for our breakfast food...then a server (not our server) comes up to us and says that the kitchen ran out of french toast so we have to pick something else. I can&#39;t believe they waited 40 minutes to tell us that. We were bummed. Nothing comped or anything like that either. Even drinks comped would have been nice or throw in something else. 
Server was good but didn&#39;t fill drinks fast enough even though the room is small. Probably has something to do with having to go up and down stairs (the kitchen is downstairs but restaurant is on the second floor). That&#39;s gotta add some inefficiencies. 
Anyway, meal was good regardless and they&#39;ve only been open 3 weeks so hopefully they can iron out the kinks because they have a lot of good things going for them with their food (would be nice to have an actual lunch menu though and better hours where they don&#39;t close from 2-5 or whatever). 
Food: 4+ stars
Restaurant atmosphere: 4 stars (restaurant on 2nd floor is small and very modern/european; not good for big groups)
Bar atmosphere: 4 stars (the rooftop bar is incredible but this place is a bit posh for my taste and the door bouncer is a bit much)
Service: 3 stars
Wait time for food: 2 stars (do not go here in a rush. even the waitress said the food is cooked SLOW)

Spaetzle, super light and creamy with a butternut squash pur√©e which was a fun flavor combo and pretty on the plate, the moroccan shrimp with quinoa, also really good, and the scallop tofu, which was served on Swiss chard and a strawberry relish, which I&#39;m not a vegan but it was really interesting I was into it. Also got the house steak which had some herb butter on it which was a nice touch and fried Brussels that for someone who hates Brussel sprouts, totally at them all lol and the fish they had, which was the Walleye... super pretty and tasted even better, it came with a wild rice and mushrooms and a little light raw Swiss chard on top that was dressed with a semi sweet lemon vinaigrette, soo good, a must try! And ended the whole thing with a chocolate cafe that will send you straight down the diabetes road haha and I mean that in a good way, it was moist and very tasty.

What a mistake!  First, the layout of the first floor is bizarre.  If I hadn&#39;t read other reviews I wouldn&#39;t have known that we needed to go all the way to the back to order sandwiches.  We had a muffeletta, 1/2 Cuban and a cup of chicken noodle soup.  After we ordered our food we had to go back to the middle of the place marked &#34;Beer and Wine&#34; to get two glasses of wine from the very limited wine list.  Maybe I should have expected this from a beer place.  The Beer and Wine section is also where you get breakfast items, really?

The chicken noodle soup was salty (cheap soup base) and didn&#39;t have any noodles in it.  The 1/2 Cuban had at most 2 oz. of meat on it.  The pork didn&#39;t look good and the ham was just ok.  The cheese was hard to find.  We took one bite and left the rest.  The muffeletta was worse.  The outer casing was still on the meat.  I choked on the first bite.  I took it back to the cashier.  She said, &#34;Sorry&#34;.  The remade sandwich arrived 8 min later.  SAME PROBLEM!  Are they kidding?  Also, would it kill them to put a few chips on the plate so it doesn&#39;t look empty when served?  I took this back to the cashier and asked for a refund.  She called over the floor manager because she didn&#39;t know how to do that transaction.  He didn&#39;t know how to do it either so he called over a person who I assumed was the General Manager.  He comped our food ticket.

Bottom line:  Don&#39;t bother with this place (first floor).  The food gets 1 star.  The service is pretty much clueless.  They only get 2 stars because they comped our food after I got TWO inedible sandwiches."

Good overall. An interesting and innovative addition to Downtown Naperville. Creative farm-to-table menu with appetizers, small plates, salads, charcuterie, and main courses. 

Main entree choices are somewhat limited as there were only 7 dishes, with only one fish and one chicken dish. The oxtail dish was great. It is served with papperdelle pasta that was phenomenal. The gnocchi (one of the small plates) were good but greasy from the pancetta in the dish. There is a delicious creme br√ªl√©e trio which was very good but unfortunately came cool to our table. There were many other deserts that looked amazing 

Two disappointing things: the meat and cheese tray only included two tiny pieces of cheese (there was a lot of meet though) and was not worth the $26 price. One person in the group wanted to substitute a side on their main dish. The chef said no. So then they asked for an additional (different) side (for an additional charge). The chef even turned that down.

There were a lot of interesting items on the menu and I look forward to try them out soon. 

Wide selection of beers, which of course include a lot of Two Brothers brews, wine, and spirits. Service was good and the design is amazing. 

The online reservation system worked very well. You get a confirmation text the day of. Then when you check in at the restaurant, you can hang out in the first floor cafe. You get a text when your table is ready. 

If you get a table towards the back you can see the (very) open kitchen. 

The whole place looks amazing. In addition to the full service restaurant on the 2nd floor, the first floor is a cafe. I look forward to getting some breakfast or lunch there soon. It even had a deli counter. 

Overall, worth trying the Modern Tavern out.

I wonder a bit why they have high chairs at all on the 2nd floor.  Probably my favorite place in a long time that there&#39;s an excellent chance I will not return to ever.

There were a lot of items on the menu that I was curious to try.  Two strikes against it, not a lot of promising vegetarian choices for my wife who aspires to more than a salad, and a rough selection of choices for kids.

First, I&#39;ll cover the kids.  Certainly, they don&#39;t have a kids menu. The waitress pointed out the Bolognese (house made fettucine, house ground beef and pork, pecorino cheese), which looked to be the perfect choice for the unadventurous/children   So, which ~$20 entree to get a 3 year old who is in a picky phase and was never that keen on pasta in tomato based sauces?  We were tempted by a risotto appetizer, but had concerns about spices with the cajun spiced shrimp, and the waitress suggested she wouldn&#39;t advise it for a kid based on the spice.  We settled on gnocchi (parsley parsinade, gorgonzola cream sauce), it was very good, we had two kids (one was a currently less picky 1 year old) who didn&#39;t seem very keen on it.   Not tragic, it happens.

Here&#39;s my point about serving kids. After our meal, we went downstairs and perused the1st floor area and the little cafe there totally had a kids menu that would have been perfect to just have something simple from while we adults ate tasty fine dining.  I won&#39;t rule out that young children aren&#39;t particularly desired on the 2nd floor, although they didn&#39;t balk at my request for a high chair, and try to push us towards the 1st floor or anything.

The food was very good. My wife, who is not a fan of meat, but will fall back on fish and things in a pinch, she had the fish of the day (I forget what), and it was really well prepared and tasty, but she kind of agonized over falling back on it.  She had looked at the various salads and none particularly cried out to her.  which is while I was discussing what I was picking out with her, I was like &#39;Well, I have a feeling we&#39;re never coming back here, based on your struggling to pick something and figuring out something for the kids, so I might as well pick something really interesting looking.&#34;  I picked the oxtail (beer braised oxtail ravioli,
mascarpone cheese, ricotta, truffle cream, candied walnuts, red wine reduction).  It was very good, I was wishing we still had bread around that I could have used to pick up that sauce.

So, it was kind of weird to have such a positive sort of lightly negative experience.  I gave it 4 stars, my initial thought was 5 stars, the fact that it&#39;s a tough sell to everyone else who I would generally be eating with would bring it down to 4, but then I go downstairs and see they could cater more to picky children, but just kind of... don&#39;t... and that makes me want to drop it to a 3.  The food was really good, though, so it&#39;s a super low-in-my-mind 4, because I can&#39;t do 3.5."

I had the chance to hang out in the Market Cafe the day before and had a nice time with a great pour over while working on my laptop. 

The restaurant itself sits upstairs above the Market Cafe. We got seated promptly due to my wife making a reservation via their website. The staff was all really nice and the ambience was fantastic. I also liked that it wasn&#39;t super loud, which can ruin the dining experience. 

Now to the food. The menu is a mixture of &#34;farm to table&#34; small plates and entree&#39;s we ordered two small plates and the burger to split. 

The two small plates were delicious however very small. Not quite big enough to even share with each other. Which was a bit disappointing. But hey when in Rome eat small I suppose. 

The Burger and fries were also very good but again a modest portion for $17. 

Overall the dining experience was very pleasurable. I would say however it&#39;s a bit over priced for what it is. Also for a &#34;farm to table&#34; restaurant I saw no listings for where the ingredients were sourced from. So who really knows. 

I would say go once and enjoy some interesting fare but then frequent Sovereign in DT Plainfield for a more affordable and tastier experience."

Excited finally someone renovated the whole building- you know if you seen it before, it was desperately needed. The Craftsman is a three level level building - first floor coffee shop feel with the added bonus of being able to order wine or two brothers beer on tap, some baked goods, sandwiches, small meat market. The second floor - open concept kitchen, fine dining restaurant. Dining room was busy so we ended up going to the third floor with some friends. Third floor had just opened tonight which we were told will be open late during the week and weekends 2am. To get in, take the solid black iron door on your left all the way up- late night mixology, speciality cocktail, beers, wines, and local liquors and small plates, 21 and up only. Had a beer and some small plates just for a late night snack. We had ordered the smoked salmon drip with beer crackers, mac-n-cheese, deviled egg trio, and chicken empanada and everything tasted great. Great flavors and nice presentation, friendly staff. Upstairs vibe is relaxed, soft lighting, great place to enjoy a upscale drinks alone or with friends. You will not find any televisions, instead enjoy the company of your friends.  Overall great vibe and excited to explore all the floors more. Till then cheers! Awesome concept that Naperville was missing."

After being seated we waited about 15 minutes for a server to acknowledge us. I realize they are new and really let it slide.

The real rub was the quality of the food and lack of customer focus.  How do you screw up a hamburger? We&#39;ll start by charging $18 for a dry burger with a cheap bun. No frills. I had to ask for lettuce, tomato and onion. Quote&#34; I will check with my manager to see if I can get that&#34; . I asked what were are the cheese options &#34;only white cheddar to make it easy on the  cook staff&#34;.  WTF?

$18 for a bad no frill burger and 15 pieces of soggy fries. Bad value and I feel they are arrogant based on their name. Better choices for food and drink and if they don&#39;t alter their way, well, good luck."

Nice looking place that has no clue what it wants to be.   Walked in at noon on a Saturday to grab a beer and some lunch.  They proceeded  to make this as difficult as possible.  First, non lunch menu, just brunch.  Hmmmm, not what I was in the mood for. Luckily they have a deli serving sandwiches.  Limited menu, but I made due.  Everything is a la carte so that&#39;s a bummer.  That&#39;s okay though, I can deal with it.  Try to order a beer.  Can&#39;t order beer where I order my sandwich.  REALLY?!?!?   Okay, they&#39;re not making this easy.   Go to order a beer and they&#39;re out of the Atom Smasher.  I saw it on the board when I walked in.  So now the beer menu board is being changed.   Once again I adapt and order an Eble&#39;s Weiss.  Always good.  So now do I tip where I ordered my food?  Tip where I ordered my beer?  Leave a tip at the table even though there&#39;s no waiter?  I think I&#39;ll stick with the Two Brothers Tap House in Warrenville at least it&#39;s full service.   Plus parking is a lot easier (I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d EVER say that about parking there).   I was so looking forward to coming here.  Maybe with some time to adjust the experience would be better. For now, I&#39;d hold off on coming here.  Oh... before I forget...  the food was just okay.  Got a Pork Cemita and some chips.  Sandwich was okay, chips were over cooked, but crispy.   No clue what&#39;s on the 3rd floor either.  I heard some people talking and I think it&#39;s a bar.  I didn&#39;t see any signage, but I&#39;ll take their word for it."

We had heard the Craftsman was open and thought to check it out. We heard there was a restaurant on the 2nd floor so after we walked in, we headed towards the stairs. Saw someone (an employee) at the foot of the stairs so I asked if we could go upstairs. He simply said &#34;no&#34;. After standing there confused for a bit, we then continued walking to the back of the place. My sister-in-law then found out the 2nd floor doesn&#39;t open until later from a different employee. We just left. The initial employee was rude and not helpful at all. The place hasn&#39;t been open long and clearly we were confused and would have appreciated some additional information and guidance."

First, we tried to order some beer off of their bottle list and the server told us that they only had two of the 10 or so bottles on the list available. I ordered the gnocchi and my friend got the bolognese. The gnocchi came on a very small plate for $13. There was no browning on the gnocchi. It was pretty bland tasting and tough instead of soft and fluffy. My friends Bolognese for $17 was a larger portion but not generous by any means. It tasted very porky to me, but was pretty good. They also have a burger that comes with fries for $17. The table next to me ordered it and it looked  closer to a slider than a burger. At another table I saw the fillet which is $44 and it looked pretty tasty, but looked to be an 8-10oz portion. Service was fine. Nothing bad, but not great either.

Overall, I was pretty disappointed. I understand that fine dining restaurants typically don&#39;t have large portions but I expect better presentation and execution for the price. I say order a sandwich at the deli or get a coffee on the first floor and skip the overpriced restaurant if you want to try out The Craftsman."

The atmosphere was great, however the food was over priced for the lack of flavor in their dishes. We had the shrimp with cabbage salad and oxtail ravioli. For a $15.00 salad, it came with a couple of tiny fried breaded shrimp and very bland chopped salad. Not worth the price. The oxtail ravioli, the meat inside the ravioli needed salt and the presentation was not very impressive. The just threw 6 raviolis in a circle and tossed some candied walnuts on top. I really want this restaurant to succeed. They have a great location, nice architecture, nice concept, however they need to up their game.

The service was fine. The hamburger I got for $17.00 with fries only was tasty but to me over priced.  I also found it odd that the chef determined what should go on the burger --ketchup/onion. No lettuce, no tomato etc... No condiments at the table. I could get the same burger (my way) and fries at other downtown Naperville restaurants for a lot less (e.g., Five Guys).  Truly,  I was kind of expecting (hoping for) more.  I really feel like Two Brothers got away from what made them successful (i.e., beer). The menu is limited and focus is seemingly on cheese and sausage plates. Not really what I would be looking for on a regular basis. I really can&#39;t say that I would want to return. Not because of bad food or service as I indicated what I experienced in that regard was fine. Its just the restaurant concept and limited menu offerings did nothing for me as far as distinguishing this place from the many others in downtown Naperville..  However, this is only one man&#39;s opinion. I wish them .

Chicagoland has countless breweries and some top notch beer, so I looked forward to seeing Two Brothers find their place in downtown Naperville. Two Brothers is a brand that I trust, and The Craftsman hit close to our expectations, but we were left wanting more. When I think of Two Brothers, I think immediately of beer, however, The Craftsman is trying to hop on the farm to table train in almost too high a fashion. What Naperville needs is a great bar (minus the whole stabbing in the streets ordeals) with a fantastic draft selection. I&#39;m not saying that The Craftsman needs other local beer on draft (let&#39;s not mention Windy City distribution here ), but their selection should be on draft (at least!!). What their former location (The Wise Boxer) had going for it was a wide draft list with a comfortable first floor setting. However, as told by a manager, &#34;if I wanted beer, I needed to drive 4 miles either direction&#34;.... But hey, isn&#39;t this run by Two Brothers? 

To the food: the food and service were excellent! Perhaps, we would like to see the main floor become more of a brew pub. I truly believe The Craftsman missed out on a target crowd that would appreciate an afternoon beer any day of the week, with a wide selection of draft beer. Yes, you are able to get their beer/wine at their first floor bar, however the drafts are very limited! 

We will try the top floor after it&#39;s completed, however we were told the drafts would also be limited up there, but the wine and (limited) barrel liquors would be flowing. *sigh* The iconic brewery Two Brothers is jumping on another train that they will do well in, but they need to maintain what their true branding is... Beer!"

Went there for lunch with some girlfriends today and we all ordered the Apple Avocado Salad and added Chicken.  For an extra $3 we got the smallest 3 slivers of cold, dry chicken ever. Really?  They did add 2 more pieces of chicken when we told them we were disappointed in the salad, but I was shocked that it didn&#39;t come that way originally.  Also they need to add more tables or open up the 2nd floor, which isn&#39;t being used, because people were just standing around without a table or leaving before they ordered since there was no tables.  I feel like this place could be something very cool, but they aren&#39;t utilizing the space well and need to look at their menu and realize people don&#39;t want to pay $13 for a bowl of lettuce. On a plus side, their beers are $5 (though they already ran out of the Octoberfest and it&#39;s only Oct 10th and they own the brewery) and their coffee is delicious."

The menu is on the wall and not online, my suggestion would be to make it available online so that more people know what to order.

I always get my dad a few of the frozen prepared desserts, which they have a large selection of.  They also operate a carry-out portion of the store, and it is owned by the same gentleman who operates another delicious Indian restaurant in Naperville.

The meat/butcher section looks fantastic, but I haven&#39;t personally picked up anything from that counter yet.

To begin with, as is customary in most stores; most of the items do not have prices mentioned on them (or on the rack they are placed or in the aisle they are located). This is ideal from the store owner&#39;s viewpoint; since you are in the dark about the prices and will almost always overpay on items at the register! 

Add to this, the extremely unhealthy food that is served (they have a take-out menu) and it makes this place less desirable. Similar to another Yelp poster who mentioned losing their faith in this place because of the watered down food; we have too, but because of tastelessness and healthiness: their butter chicken was a paste, chicken 65 had tough chicken pieces and the chicken noodles were raw with blandness - the chicken felt uncooked and the noodles were bland. This is depressing because we had indeed ordered food from them that was slightly better than average, once upon a time.

We stick to the place called &#39;Jalaram Plaza&#39;, also in Naperville, that is ethical - with prices clearly mentioned everywhere, an incentive if you shop for greater than a particular amount, and a staggering array of well - organized Indian food items (masalas, atta, rice, chivdas, chips, sweets, frozen veggies, biscuits etc.) of excellent quality per unit price.

If this place wants to improve, I suggest:
1) Clearly marking prices on every item in the store
2) Organizing the store better
3) Hire a separate team only in charge of the &#39;restaurant / take - out&#39; section of the business and focus on quality
4) Increasing the number of items in the store and competitively marking them to attract more customers and grow business."

The party room has kitchen basics like a sink, counter top, and electrical outlets.  The room was enormous with enough space for a wedding banquet.  Everyone could comfortably sit, stand, and socialize without being trampled by the kids running around.  There was a stage at the front of the room, which I suppose could be used for a variety of things.

The facility itself was very clean.  This is not the grungy, sticky, questionable Chuck E Cheese kind of places I remember going to as a kid.  The building is well maintained.  All guests have to wear a wristband too, and an employee appeared to be manning the front entrance at all times.  

Aside from the cafe, which is separate from the party room and playground, there is no food service.  But you can bring in your own food or have it catered/delivered.  I don&#39;t think they allow alcohol, but I&#39;m not sure.

I liked that it wasn&#39;t overcrowded or loud, and there was enough room to spread out or wander.  The space itself allows party hosts to be creative with their themes or ideas too, which is nice.  It&#39;s a nice option in the area, but there&#39;s not much to keep adults engaged unless they&#39;re chasing after a tot."

The menu has a little of everything on it including a whole bunch of breakfast and light lunch items. I challenged them with a 16 ounce Chai with coconut milk (I&#39;m vegan) and a double shot of espresso. They had only almond milk, which was better, and loose leaf Chai, which was better, and it cost me a buck less than Starbucks.

There is a small entrance fee. I think it&#39;s about $5 or $35 for a six month membership.  Outside food and drink are not allowed but they do have a cafe. The cafe offers coffee, teas, sandwiches, cookies, etc. I love the iced coffee and simple snacks. I would not recommend ordering lunch if you&#39;re in a hurry. The lunch items/meals take awhile to receive. It is hard to wait for your food and still watch the kids playing. The food is great if you&#39;re not in a time crunch.

The major negative is that I found the lady working the front desk to be aggressive about the rules to a fault. My friend&#39;s 18 month old took off his socks. The worker pointed it out (fair and I appreciate it). I picked him up and immediately started to address it by gathering the socks and all. And I was trying to make conversation. This particular kid HATES socks and I was just chatting about that. Her only response was to tell me multiple times that he had to wear socks here or he couldn&#39;t play. I clearly understand. I&#39;m putting them back on. He&#39;s not even two. He&#39;s not doing it on purpose. Relax. If I had been intentionally ignoring the rule, it would be one thing, but I was trying my best to comply. The worker had the same attitude about other things. She seemed invested in the rules to the point of rudeness, asking me multiple times if I had read the rules, etc., when I was still filling out the waiver! It really cast a pall on my experience. I felt like she didn&#39;t want to be there and didn&#39;t want us there. I considered the pass, but I am not going back and volunteering for that experience again.

I brought my 18 month old and met a friend with her two kids this week. I bought a 6 month pass when first arriving and now slightly regret it.  

Usually the play places we go to are a bit more expensive but allow outside food. This place does not allow outside food - fine no big deal - I get that&#39;s it&#39;s part of their mission. 

The front staff was friendly and nice. They have a fast food style jungle gym in the entrance and a baby room and another room filled with toys. I expected a lot more based on their video.  What I didn&#39;t notice was a dirty bucket for parents to put toys that may have made it into their children&#39;s mouth. This seems like a huge omission to me - unless I missed it. I also didn&#39;t see hand sanitizer or disinfectant wipes anywhere.   

I was disappointed in the room with the &#34;other toys&#34; (treehouse room maybe) for ages 2-5. While they did have some plastic boxes filled with blocks- cars- things like that. There is a kitchen with no food I could find and other toys that pieces were missing. 

What bothered me the most was taking a break and getting a snack with my child, my friend, and her two kids. As we were done and I was putting away the high chairs my daughter was following behind giggling and cooing at the sight of the rolling high chair. I had a grumpy old man ask to &#34;keep her quiet, she was hurting his ears&#34; - seriously this is a cafe with a play place attached! I understand it&#39;s a &#34;quiet&#34; zone but there were plenty of people of cell phones and other devices making as much noise if not more.   I was really thrown off and disappointed. I said I&#39;m working on it, we are leaving as my response and walked away as he was continuing to groan about his ears. Why can&#39;t people see the joy children have and give there very tired parents some understanding?- besides I was cleaning up and we were leaving- why feel the need to ruin my day. I was truly annoyed. 

I bought a pass so we will, I  guess be back but I feel like now I have to look over my shoulder and make sure she isn&#39;t laughing or cooing when someone may not like it. Here&#39;s hoping the next visit goes better. 

Oh oh.  As far as the cafe goes- the staff was friendly and kind. The food was standard and reasonable. Very clean. As to the people complaining about noise level - seems slightly silly... any place where children are present - isn&#39;t going to be a library, so adjust your expectations."

The positives are the nice open space and immaculate bathrooms plus very nice people who work here.  Also, the business model of using the profits for charity is very commendable.

The negatives are the high noise level from the children&#39;s playground and the fact that my coffee was just OK, nothing great.  Not sure why because they use Intelligensia beans.

First impression when walking in was that the front desk ladies are very welcoming and nice. They explained the process very clearly to sign in, and were helpful to answer any questions. Sign up/in was painless and fast. The place was very clean in both the cafe area and in the baby room. There was a lady that came in twice during the time we were there to pick up stray toys every now and then, and also to bring toys/introduce toys to my son who was a bit shy at the beginning. What I really like is that there&#39;s a &#34;family restroom&#34; in the playroom (which was clean!!), but really it&#39;s a changing station and a toddler-size toilet. There&#39;s also a dirt devil vac to clean up after yourself and a sink (outside of the bathroom) if you need it. There were a few comfy chairs for adults, as well as a rocker. All of the smaller toys were well-organized in bins, and there were plenty of larger toys throughout the room. I love introducing my son to new toys without having to buy them first lol. The cafe was alright. They had huge (HUGE) cookies, and while that sounds like a plus, remember that the center can be a bit wet/raw still by the time the outside is done baking (bleh). The tea was acceptable, though nothing to write home about. It was hot and tasted like bagged tea. If you&#39;re a loose leaf tea snob then don&#39;t bother, because it will taste burnt/bitter. :P Anyhoo, I&#39;ll definitely bring my son back here to play. We even left our coats outside the play room and they seemed very safe. It was nice to not worry about kids whose parents aren&#39;t paying attention.

There are plenty of tables, free wifi (that in itself is worth it!), super affordable drinks and snacks... and they even have paninis and a soup of the day! I was quite impressed that they offer Ghirardelli chocolate for their hot chocolate (served with milk for only a buck!)... though I ordered a tea because the pomi-berry sounded delish at the time.

I also ordered a chocolate muffin. Oh my heavens. It was gooey inside like a brownie and only $1.20! I couldn&#39;t even get half of a muffin at Starbucks for that price.

tea: just over a buck
muffin: $1.20

total: $2.47 for a fun stroll on a crisp fall day! 
The fireplace was going and there were news updates on the flatscreens that I was a big fan of. My clothes didn&#39;t reek of coffee (ehm, like Starbucks) because I sat with a friend for an hour... and ...

best of all... proceeds go to World Relief! I will be a frequent visitor and recommend checking it out especially if you have a kiddo. You can order something hot, a snack, and your kiddo can play in a safe and warm environment. An indoor park with perks! :)

Nice.

The jungle gym or play house is free for kids to play. The big playhouse was closed for an hour for a birthday party when we were there but later I found out they do post the party schedule on their site: http://www.groundsforhopecafe.org/#/birthdays/birthday-calendar I will check before I take my kids in next time. 

There is also 4 different play rooms on &#34;kids street&#34; to play if there is not booked for the birthday parties. Me and my 3 year old were in the Wonder room which was open at the time. It was designed for infants and toddlers. They also have the changes pads, wipes, and even a kids&#39; bathroom attached. 

I got a cup of nice latte for about the half price of the Starbucks one. Watched her play for an hour before I got a huge sugar cookie for her from the Cafe. Needless to say, both of us were very content when we left.

As a former barista myself, almost no coffee shop can live up to my standards, so that&#39;s why it&#39;s a 4 instead of a 5. 

First of all, the prices are just phenomenal! First time, I got a chai latte and 2 muffins for less than I&#39;d pay for a small coffee at starbucks. That was a Sunday morning, just before service (Grounds for Hope is inside the Trinity Lutheran Church building, where they have really cool contemporary church services). So it was uber-busy, and the chai wasn&#39;t up to my standards. I&#39;ve been told by friends it&#39;s really good when the place is not so slammed and not made by a brand new employee. 

Went again this past Monday night after work. Got a hot apple cider (oh sooo good!) because I didn&#39;t want caffeine at 7pm, and was happily surprised to discover grilled cheese sandwiches on the menu!

I ordered a grilled cheese with american cheese on herb bread. They use a panini maker, so it takes about 5 minutes. Totally worth the wait! I&#39;ll be ordering this again and again!  And the sandwich and cider? Still less than you&#39;d pay for a (what do they call large again?) coffee at starbucks.

Also good to know: there&#39;s free wi-fi, flat screen tv&#39;s, board games on a shelf around the corner, and a huge jungle gym for the kids!  Great place to bring kids to work off their energy while you relax (and way healthier than taking them to the McD&#39;s) or meet with your friends!

p.s. a portion of all sales goes to charity - you can&#39;t get better than that!"

When we went today, it wasn&#39;t very crowded at all.  Much better for one&#39;s sanity than, say, Little Monkey Bizness.  Plus, it was free on the weekend!

The atmosphere was pretty calm.  The facilities were immaculately clean, spacious, and new.  I enjoyed being able to eat my lunch (panini, salad, chips, and fancy iced tea) in the playroom while my 3 year old played with the various toys.  Staff was friendly.  Will definitely go back!"

The stay at home part is the hardest. Getting out of the house is super important for things like sanity. I heard about this cool place via mommy groups and thought it sounded great, well, it is. First of all it&#39;s part of a church, in a strip mall, which makes it sort of hard to find. At first you think this used to be a grocery store but it&#39;s a brilliant use of space. To the left is a big, enclosed play area for bigger kids with some seating for adults. To the right is seating and a small cafe. So far I&#39;ve only had coffee, which to be honest with you isn&#39;t great but whatever, I love the place. My friend says the smoothies are good though. Also, I like the profits go to folks that need it.

There is a front desk registration deal and they recently started charging admission which I think is okay. I&#39;m sure it takes some big bucks to run the place. Back to the layout, behind the front desk is the play rooms which are really big and nicely stocked. I spend the most time in the baby/toddler room which we love. It&#39;s clean and well stocked with mostly functioning toys and even some swings for the little babies to nap in. The only problem I had here was once there was a lady watching like ten kids and some of the kids were too big for the room and throwing toys at the babies. This happened during a zumba class. FYI, if you take an exercise class here make sure there is someone capable watching your child. There were crying infants and that drives me up the wall. My friend did complain about the situation and said just let them know at the front desk if it happens again. Okay, will do super nice people. 

They also rent out rooms for birthday parties stocked with an attendant. Overall, great place for mom&#39;s trying to stay sane. Or some semblance of that word."

The climbing area is fun but past the doors it seems like a lot of wasted  space. There&#39;s only a few bins of toys that my 4 year old quickly tired of. Compared to monkey bizness or kids town in Wheaton this place just seemed like a giant open play space with hardly any activities."

WHAT IS THAT PLACE ANYWAY?
Grounds For Hope Cafe in Lisle is one of the most unrecognized and unappreciated places around!!!!!  Moms, Dads, Grandparents, Nannies: attention:
There is an infant room, playhouse for ages(2-9), a Treasure room(with some toys) and a Treehouse room!   It is a non-profit organization which means: FREE!!!!!

2 Rules: 

1.  NO OUTSIDE FOOD OR BEVERAGES(against health dept. regulations)
2.  ALL KIDS IN PLAY AREA MUST HAVE SOCKS ON

That&#39;s all...  Get a muffin, cup of coffee, or make a donation and they will stay open providing you with wi fi and a little break!!!
******They are the cleanest play area around also!!!!!!

I HOPE YOU CAN ALL COME TO GROUNDS FOR HOPE CAFE!!!!

It&#39;s a place where you can get a decent cup of coffee or food while your child plays.  The prices are also very reasonable.  The coffee shop itself is a little noisy if you were to just go for quiet talk or reading but if you&#39;re going for the play areas - it&#39;s a wonderful find (especially since it&#39;s free to play!).  The staff is always pleasant.  Sign up for the email list, they mail out a free coffee coupon about once a month.  They have assorted rooms with toys where your child can play - plus their treehouse area.  It&#39;s always busy in the mornings and can get quite noisy/chaotic but it&#39;s a nice play to connect to other parents and have some coffee."

Nice to always give business to organizations trying to make the world a better place.  The food was not bad.  I had a pannini, non-descript, but not bad.  Turkey.  It was not near warm enough as the cheese had not melted, but that was a simple fix but having the nice staff put in back in the press for me.  The wild rice and chicken soup (homemade) was really good.  Now remember, this place also has a inside play area for youngins, so be prepared for screaming babies and tired/whiney kids.  It is nice to this available for families.  Moms can enjoy a treat and a chat in a clean, safe fun inside place and kids and spend a little energy.

The first time, before we went my wife called and asked the lady on the phone if it was ok that we bring our 16 month old to the play area.  She said that was absolutely fine.  We went that evening and had a great time. The coffee was good and affordable, and my scone was delicious.  It was also nice to find out about a new place in our community and the grounds for hope idea is wonderful. I have been back a couple times with my daughter and have had wonderful experiences.

Our last visit was not so good.  From the minute we came in I noticed an employee eyeballing everyone.  At the time of our arrival there were a hand full of other kids and their mothers.  As my daughter began to climb and play ( me supervising her) and my wife watching ( 40 weeks pregnant with our second!) the crowd of kids thinned out to two little boys and my daughter. Again, as this visit progressed I would noticed this employee watching all of us With her hands on her hips and NO smile on her face.  My wife and the other mother were talking about the kids and the community as I was playing with the three kids, and this employee comes up to my wife, leans over the table very close and very &#34;hush hush&#34; and says, &#34;how old is your daughter?&#34; my wife says &#34; she&#39;s 16 months almost 17&#34;  the lady continues to say, &#34;well, i guess its ok when were not busy, but we would appreciate if you would follow the rules.&#34; my wife says, &#34;ok, well I called before we ever came and asked if it was ok for her age to come here and I was told it was&#34;  She says &#34; Yes well  your children have to be accompanied at all times no matter what age&#34; implying that we were not accompanying our child &#34; and parents seem to think this is a place to come and socialize and not watch their kids.&#34;   We were so offended we left.

To be honest, my wife and I felt like we were being judged.  We are a young married couple (trendy and fun) and we felt like this lady was judging us from the moment we walked in.  First of all, you don&#39;t want people coming here to socialize, then you shouldn&#39;t open a coffee shop and play area OPEN TO THE PUBLIC!  Second, to be judged by an employee of this establishment which is essentially church owned and operated is completely hypocritical!  

If you are a new church and looking to open your arms to the community and bring people in to join your congregation, this is not a very good welcoming committee.  This person alone has ruined our experience with this establishment by representing her church, congregation and employers so poorly."

This is the first time coming here and being a lamb fan I have to say it was a great to see the menu. I will start with the food, everything was great from the lamb burgers for the kids to the steak to the roasted lamb with the only complaint being the asparagus that came with the lolly-pop lamb chops tasted boiled then grilled for marks but had zero flavor. The service could have been better, the server&#39;s workload was way to high and I had to follow her to another table as she ran by ours for the second time. The issue I have with this restaurant is the special birthday menu that was printed for our table (yes the custom menu is a fantastic idea but I am getting to the why). The manager typed on our menus &#34;
&#39;Celebrate our 7 year anniversary with us Monday, October 15th thru Thursday October 27th 50% off our menu(food &amp;non-alcoholic beverages only)&#39; 
We asked the server for this discount and was told that the discount only applied on the anniversary day. I then found the manager and asked him about his. He came to our table and apologized stating that he made a mistake while typing the custom menu up and put the wrong dates for the 50% off. I asked him if he planned on honoring this since it is advertised on his menu and we were told no. I spent ten years in the business, friends longer, as managers and can tell you this. I would have admitted my mistake and defiantly honored this 50% off as advertised. So to Basils.. You had a first time customer with the food, I looked past the service but sorry I cannot forgive false advertising, mistake or not... You lost me and the other family plus neighbors I have told all thanks to your manager on Duty  Friday night October 21."

The ambiance is great with a visible kitchen. There weren&#39;t many people in the restaurant given the time of day, so we didn&#39;t need to wait to get seated at all. Service was good and prompt. We ordered hummus as starter and it was really good. Coarse hummus with warm pita bread! They also served some sesame bread with butter which was fresh and yummy too. For our main course we ordered chicken kabob, vodka gnocchi and basil pasta. I personally ate the chicken kabob and it was truly delicious. The grilled vegetables were done to perfection, the chicken was flavorful and the rice and gravy was good too. The other dishes were both vegetarian dishes and my family loved them. I will add pictures of these dishes to this review - they are all highly recommended, especially the chicken kabob! Nothing bad to report here... A very positive lunch experience!"

Like circled the parking lot way too many times packed. Finally found a spot and was excited to try the highly rated suburb Greek food. We had reservations for 6:30 and we waited until 6:50 to be seated. 

Our waitress didn&#39;t even come to greet us for another 10 minutes. When she finally arrived we ordered saganaki, fried calamari and a crab cake (we were hungry). It came out shortly and the crab cake and saganaki were delicious, the fried calamari was mediocre and kind of tasted like it was previously frozen.

We ordered two plates of gyros, rib eye, lamb lollipops, and a lamb burger. We ordered food and waited a lengthy time for it to come out. 

We&#39;re a sharing family so we all helped ourselves to each other&#39;s entrees. My gyro was AMAZING. You could tell it was made in house and fresh. The  tzatziki sauce was mixed with feta and added to the deliciousness! They provide a healthy amount of gyro meat and too little pita to go with it. 

The lamb burger was okay, nothing to call home about.

I didn&#39;t get a chance to try the the lamb lollipops but heard it was amazing. 

The rib eye seemed like it was a flank steak with ribeye cost. Sooo chewy and tough to cut. We ordered it medium and it was well done. I wouldn&#39;t recommend that for anyone. 

Service was slowwwwww! Our waitress rarely visited our table. We had to ask other servers to grab her every time we wanted to talk to her.

For the price of this place, I&#39;ll stick to grabbing gyro sandwich in the city."

The food was lovely- I had the spanakopita and an IPA, and my husband had a pasta dish. The menus were customized for the birthday girl, which was a nice touch! They let us bring in our own cake, and didn&#39;t charge us any extra for letting us use their dishes and silverware (we cut it ourselves).

Their gyros are good as well any of the traditional Greek fare. This visit we started with the usual, saganaki. So good...opa!  I then had Basils wedge salad, which was fresh, crisp and had lots of blue cheese, bacon and tomatoes. I ordered the grilled octopus appetizer for my entree which was prepared perfectly and had a lot of flavor. I loved it. I ended with a cappuccino and a free complimentary dessert that I received a coupon through email.  The on,y negative is the cappuccino was served in a tiny cup and was not even full, plus is was lukewarm at best. I like a hot cappuccino...and fill the cup to the brim, please.  Service is always good here. The restaurant has a nice bar area and a large dining room. In warmer weather, their patio is great with a large outdoor fireplace. I definitely recommend trying Basils.  If you like Greek food, you&#39;ll enjoy this place."

I find in the midst of the suburbs locating an &#34;independent&#34; dining establishment is difficult.  Basil&#39;s has all the right moves but execution often falls short.  I&#39;ve been three times and keep telling myself I&#39;ve not really dialed into their &#34;menu stars!&#34;  Both times I was with a dining companion who leaned to the traditional gyros platter which is as well prepared as it is abundant.  The basil chips appetizer are battered zucchini and yellow squash  which are not as &#34;chippy&#34; as you&#39;d expect since there&#39;s no crunch factor but they are tasty.  On my latest visit I had the octopus stew which was served with two starches (rice and potatoes) and was a bit too home spun for me.  Who does two starches, and those Greek potatoes are greasy and bland...they need work!  The stew was sweet and just left me unimpressed.  The Mediterranean pasta was too oily but baklava for dessert was tasty, if a little stingy on portion size.  The stars of the restaurant are the servers, who strive to make your dining experience a good one!  This is why I gave it 3 instead of 2 stars.  The wine  and beer selection is small but good and the bar is talented for a good cocktail.  I like that the menu is not like an encyclopedia of choices.  I do intend to return and try saganaki, Greek Chicken, lamb and more traditional Greek items and enjoy their excellent service!"

The place was quiet when we went there during the week.  We had a variety of starters.  Gyros, grilled octopus, and dolmades.  The gyros was my favorite.  It&#39;s a homemade gyro meat and not the distributor bought meat.  The other two were good too, but the uniqueness and tastiness of the gyro meat was a standout.

We had a large Greek salad to share for the table.  This is the way to do it since it&#39;s a large bowl of salad.

As the main course, I had the fish special, which was fresh and well prepared.

Finally, we finished up with the dessert.  Home made cheesecake, Baklava Sundae, and the Chocolate Lava Cake.  Cheesecake is my recommendation for everyone.

The place is very nice and is a solid place for upscale Greek food.  The homemade food is definitely what sets it apart from the other random Greek places that you find in the suburbs."

I personally was very surprised and not on a good way that the charge .25 cents for the piece of pita bread....who does that??? Service was good and friendly, I didn&#39;t like they did not have platter options on the dinner menu. We found ourselves very limited as we all liked like different things and some if us had to sacrifice as it didn&#39;t make any sense to order so many food when not everyone was going to enjoy it. At the end of the day we&#39;ve had better options at other Greek restaurants. Perhaps that&#39;s what they need just to expand their options on their menu, as the rest was just fine."

We had seen the great reviews but what really pushed us over the edge to try Basils was to earn some points. This restaurant is part of the Hilton Dining Rewards so you earn points per dollar. If you are a Hilton member, this is definitely something to look into. We earned over 300 points just for having dinner. 

Anyhow, we went dressed pretty casual but I didn&#39;t feel out of place or not dressed up enough. The place is really cute and they have an outdoor area that is nicely decorated. I only wish it didn&#39;t look over a mall parking lot, boo. The first thing that I thought was kind of odd...........no booths. I don&#39;t know that I&#39;ve ever seen a restaurant without booths. It&#39;s like Peanut Butter without Jelly, or in this case Gyros without tzatziki. Somehow we survived. 

We decided to start with a few appetizers, Saganaki obviously and Basils&#39; Chips. The Saganaki was very good, to be expected. Now that we had it once there, I don&#39;t know if I would necessarily get it again. It was good but $9 for a small piece of fried cheese is a little hard to swallow. ESPECIALLY when the Basils&#39; Chips are freaking awesome. To the point that I really could have these as an entree. The portion is huge but you need to pick one dipping sauce. Being indecisive at the moment, we ordered both tzatziki and skordalia. Next time, I would only get the skordalia. It&#39;s basically mashed potatoes ground with garlic. It&#39;s phenomenal and is a perfect combination with the veggies. 

We split the Gyros. This is where it gets tricky. We saw the $14 gyros and expected some kind of side. No dice, so we ordered a $5 side of Greek Potatoes. The gyros isn&#39;t typical AT ALL. It&#39;s more of a platter that comes with one pita, quartered, tomatoes, onions, tzatziki and a mound of meat. I think the amount of meat was appropriate for the price and after taking that first bite, the quality surpassed average. This was real lamb (and beef) but goes way beyond your typical gyros. I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the Greek Potatoes, but those aren&#39;t really my thing anyway. 

For dessert we requested 1/2 and 1/2 of the two baklavas. Somehow our awesome waitress made it happen. The traditional baklava tasted WAY too &#34;clover-y&#34; for me. The chocolate dipped, however, was way good. It was a little too frozen as I read in another review but delicious none the less. 

Our waitress was awesome, food was great. Can&#39;t wait to be back!"

Even with our children. However, this evening, after our kids were well behaved for almost an entire dinner, the last 20 minutes of course were a little challenging with the baby and a toddler. The kids were walking around to some of the other nearby tables and talking to the people sitting around us, who didn&#39;t seem to mind one bit and were laughing and playing with them. The waiters and Waitresses were also very friendly and playing with our kids.The manager however, seemed really annoyed, came over to us and basically asked me to keep my kids in check, and apologized all the other tables. I would say my view of this restaurant being kid friendly has gone down the hill, and because of this, I will likely not be back. I was already stressed out enough trying to constantly wrangle up the two children, without being chastised by the manager. It made me feel like I was in the principals office. A softer approach from the manager would have been just as effective and less embarrassing. But I would like to say thank you to the waitstaff for being so nice to us this evening.

I ordered the gyros after skimming through other reviews and I would also have to agree that the gyros were right on the mark. The portion size was generous but it only came with a few measly pieces of pita bread and they charged extra for more. The price for the gyros was pricey ($18)--I could get an order in Chicago for less than half the cost. I stole a few bites of my bf&#39;s domales, which was also really good.

The staff was very nice and always there when you needed something. My gyro was okay, I would have preferred to get one big pita opposed to 3 small slices of pita bread for assembling the gyro. I also would have liked to see some rice with the dish (which is how a gyro platter is normally served). 

We were with a group and everyone else loved their food. The &#34;basils salmon&#34; is very good.  The chicken parmigiana was &#34;ok&#34; but that is to be expected considering it is not a speciality dish one would order from a Greek restaurant.

Like any long lasting relationship I&#39;ve had my ups and downs.  Like, when I&#39;ve been here on signature date nights like Valentine&#39;s Day and made a reservation I still had to wait over an hour for a table.

But, those kind of problems happen few and far between.  For the most part, I walk in get a table and love everything I&#39;ve eaten here.

The Gyros is good, but I wish it came with greek potatoes as just a huge mound of meat leaves a little to be desired.  Although this is the highest quality gyros meat you will get.  I learned something once about gyros, even though a lot of these places buy from the same suppliers their is different grades of meat.  

I always start everything off with their saganaki.  It very good.  Also their bread is usually amazing and very addicting.  Add the two together and you got yourself a great start to any meal.

I&#39;ve tried their Avgolemono a few times, and it is pure comfort food for me.  Just the right amount of lemon and the cream is not too thick.

Two things that stand out more than anything is:

Their Pork Chops are amazing and huge.  And, for dessert get the Baklava Cheesecake and drift off into a food coma that will leave you mumbling to yourself as your loved one&#39;s help you find your way to the car.

It&#39;s a big place - the parking lot seemed full, however the restaurant itself had a lot of room inside. They have a large Greek menu as well as some (to me) odd items - like ribs. I don&#39;t know why every restaurant in Chicago has to serve ribs, but this place is no exception.

Anyway, I ordered the keftedes (at the recommendation of the waitress, over the moussaka) and my companion ordered the gyros. Gyros were good, but pretty standard. They came as a &#34;plate&#34; - meaning not the sandwich you might think of, but a plate with the sliced meat, pita quarters, and toppings. They could have give us more tomato and less onion, but they were good (and frankly, just as good if not better the next day when I reheated the leftovers in the frying pan and browned the outside of the shaved meat a little).

My keftedes were a pleasant surprise. I wasn&#39;t really sure what to expect, and at first bite, they were just OK, but they kept getting better. They&#39;re mild meatballs, seasoned with a good blend of spices (including lots of cinnamon, so don&#39;t get this if you don&#39;t like cinnamon in savory foods) and served with a kind of slightly sweet red/brown gravy and rice. By the end of the meal, I really liked these. They were also good the next day - would definitely recommend to someone. And it was a huge serving, I still had several for lunch the next day.

I would definitely come back here - want to try some other things: a near by table had both fish and chicken dishes that looked really good, but I would also get either of the gyros or the keftedes. One final note - this place participates in United&#39;s Mileage Plus dining - those 120 frequent flier miles might get me a free trip from the gate to the taxiway."

First off, the menu prices online at the official website do NOT match the prices in the restaurant. I paid 30% more than the &#34;quoted&#34; online menu price.

To add insult to injury, I was not happy with the quality or taste of the food.

My least favorite thing was the dessert called Galaktoboureko which is a somewhat of a custard cake between layers of phillo dough. It had the aftertaste of the inside of a refrigerator. The texture was a bit off too.  They either put too much cornstarch or they used gelatin, which I have never seen in all the times I had galaktoboureko and I lived 5 minutes from Greektown for years and had this on many occasions.

The two stars are for the service (very prompt) and for the d√©cor (nice building - tastefully decorated and overall very good upkeep of the property)."

This used to be a favorite but after not having visited for a couple of years we came back to discover a mediocre overpriced meal was awaiting us. 

The scallops were overcooked and rubbery. The shrimp was undercooked. In the same dish. 

The Basils chicken was yummy. 

The Basils pasta, promising to be angel hair pasta, olive oil, basil and garlic with red sauce was drowning in red sauce (what was the point of the other ingredients?) and cost $18!!!! No protein! Just a bowl of pasta. What a joke. For that price there should be a chicken, shrimp or something in it. It was spaghetti marinara.

Decent food ....have had much better saganaki.

Saganaki is 10 bucks.
never seen prices that high for those dishes.
a small cup of avogolemeno dollars.
wont be going back.

I tried out Basil&#39;s when visiting home for the holidays and had a great experience. Immediately upon entering, my family was greeted by the owner. Now, I think my parents go here on occasion and it was cool to see that they remembered their names. What&#39;s cool is that the owner really cares about your dining experience and stops by tables to check in on service and your food. 

They have tons of options for food and drink. They have a rotating selection of beer on tap. Their menu is pretty extensive. They have many of your tradition greek dishes. I had the double Lamb Chop drizzled in a red wine reduction. It was amaaaaaaaazing. The grape leaves and gyros were pretty awesome too. 

We finished our dinner with some ouzo. Our server explained that there is a tradition/joke where every greek family has a bottle in the liquor cabinet. It&#39;s never opened, just sits there. It was a nice way to finish off our meal.

I will definitely be convincing my family to go back next visit home."

They did have a gf menu, which was really great to have options.  The service was wonderful as well.

Recently visited here on a Tuesday night around 7pm. The restaurant itself wasn&#39;t too busy, but the bar area was pretty crowded and there was a party of about 20 people going on in the banquet room.

We were seated right away, and the hostess was very friendly. Gave us a very nice table. The only thing is, she sat us right on top of another couple at another table. There were plenty of other tables, and why she chose to seat us right on top of someone else is beyond me. However, it was not an issue. Our server seemed a little preoccupied from the start - it appeared that they had him taking care of the large party going on in the banquet room. But, then manager stepped in a was helping him out with his tables, and since we were not in a hurry we really didn&#39;t mind. 

The food here is always phenomenal. We ordered saganaki as an appetizer, and it was awesome! She had shrimp and scallops over orzo, I had the Basil&#39;s Greek chicken breast. Both entrees were fabulous! We will definitely be back soon!"

Everything from the ambiance to the small details is accounted for and presented in a phenomenal manner. 

The management really does care for you to have a wonderful meal, and will do anything to make it right. We had ordered a gyro for my mom and she was not sure if she would like it. Our waiter Eric assured her that if she didn&#39;t like it, he would take it off the bill and get her whatever she would please. She ended up not liking it, (I don&#39;t know why, my brother and I thought it was excellent) and ordered grilled chicken instead (which was also excellent!). While she waited for her plate, we all had ours already, and they brought her a complimentary delicious soup! By far, this is the most hospitable, worthy, and quality restaurant we have been to, and takes the prize against places like Andiamos, Magiano. 

Please go and check this restaurant out, you will not be disappointed. Be sure to ask for Eric, as he&#39;ll make sure your dining is as fine as ours was and more! Thank you Basil for the exquisite evening!"

My only visit thus far was a few nights ago. The service was pretty poor. It takes awhile to get a refill, and our server kept forgetting about things that we needed in our party of six.

The prices are really expensive here for what it is. If you want lamb some of the entrees are in the forty dollar range. Luckily, we went on a night that they were having half price specials. I probably would only recommend going on a night like that, because it won&#39;t be a very good value otherwise.

The food itself was not bad, but I think I went into the meal with really high expectations. I enjoyed the roast lamb, and my wife enjoyed the lamb chops, but those plates are expensive as I mentioned. Stay away from the desserts. They aren&#39;t worth it. My wife ordered just a bowl of plain strawberries for dessert, and got charged seven dollars for them. We thought that was unnecessarily high.

All of the appetizers our table shared were quite good. That was probably the best part of the meal. I may or may not come back, but if I do it will be with some kind of deal or special going on."

My husband brought me here when I got a promotion at work, knowing that I love Greek food. It was a Tuesday night, so pretty much all the &#34;special occasion&#34; places would&#39;ve been wide open, but we finally ventured to give this place a go. It&#39;s been at it&#39;s location for 4-5 years at least, and if you know anything about this area, places go out of business VERY quickly if they don&#39;t do somewhat well.

The place is classy, but not so classy that you can&#39;t go in jeans. The manager sat us as soon as we walked in and spent a good 5 minutes telling us about the menu and how it is laid out...the small plates, the entrees...the steaks, which sounded mouth-watering by the time he was through with this elevator pitch...and the beer/drink menu. He was super enthusiastic (obviously, he&#39;s the manager), but not in a salesy way. I pretty much wanted everything on the menu, because of him! Bravo, sir!

Back to the beer/wine/drink menu...what a surprise, they had a really outstanding beer selection! I had no idea. Greek places tend to specialize in wine, so being the beer geek I am, I was over the moon. They had just had an Allagash tap takeover, so the selection for Allagash was more than I&#39;ve ever seen in my life. They also had the locals (Two Bros and Solemn Oath), between the draft and bottle selection. So BEER NERDS UNITE, this place is far from shabby.

We started with the saganaki...very delicious, great presentation by the waitress, and great for 2-3 people (or hey, enough for just me). I ordered the lamb entree with the tomato sauce (can&#39;t remember for the life of me what it is called) and my husband got the moussaka. His moussaka was excellent. My lamb was really great, although I think next time I&#39;ll get it without the tomato sauce. Don&#39;t get me wrong, it was very tasty, I think I&#39;m just a bit of a minimalist when it comes to sauces (personal preference). It was a hell of a lot of lamb, I was stuffed at the end. My only complaint would be that the potatoes were just ok. They were just kind of boring, huge potato wedges, and I think there is a missed opportunity there.

Really nice, classy place. I want to go here sometime and sit in there outdoor patio area, with their stringed lights and outdoor fireplace...it stinks that the view is of the Fox Valley Mall, but I think a few drinks and moussaka will pull me back to the vibe that Basil&#39;s offers."

You know, something a little different (and classier) than typical game day sports bar stuff. When I arrived, the hostess told me it&#39;d be a 45 minute wait because even the seats at the bar are reserved. You&#39;re kidding, right?

After about 20 minutes, I checked in with the hostess and she asks if it&#39;d be okay if we sat in the bar area. I was confused because not only was that what I had originally requested, was she not planning to seat us if I had not asked? My friend and I literally stared at the empty seats and wondered why we were not allowed to sit down. Whatever, just give me a chair.

Upon being seated, we were immediately given our menus and glasses of water (with slices of lemon on the side which was a nice touch). Not long after, our waitress came by to take our orders. We said we weren&#39;t ready and she responds by tapping on the menu and saying &#34;well, let&#39;s get on it girls.&#34; Perhaps if she had said it with a smile or a giggle, it would be playful and cute. However, she had a permanent scowl on her face so it was just rude. This attitude continued the rest of the night and definitely did not alleviate the already stressful atmosphere created by the conversation my friend and I were having... but I digress.

The poor service alone would have gotten Basils one star, but my kale salad was good and the Bulls won so it gets two."

We ate here last Saturday night, sat out on the patio which was very nice. The service is wonderful very personable and the GM stopped by twice to see if there was anything we needed. He offered to move us under the canopy as it looked like it was about to rain, which it did a little later. Fortunately we had finished dinner and we finished our drinks inside the bar.
The place is very nicely decorated and is actually not located in the right place for the type of restaurant they are.(I&#39;m sure they&#39;d do better in downtown Naperville) 
The food is very authentic and delicious, if you don&#39;t like Greek food they have American dishes that I&#39;m sure are as good. My girlfriend is Greek and knows the good stuff when she has it. 
The only negative to the evening was when a bus boy was pushing a cart of dirty dishes past us to get to the back of the restaurant. I&#39;m not sure why he&#39;d be going outside the building to do this. To make it worst as he made his way thru a gate he slammed it.... not a very romantic setting if you know what I mean.

Many restaurants miss the mark on this aspect, and I have to say it really makes the whole experience of dining here a pleasant one. 

I ordered the grilled Octopus as an appetizer, (I had never tried Octopus before, so you can imagine my nervousness). The waitress assured us that if we did not like it she would give us something else. It was amazing! They prepared it in such a way to where it feels as though you are eating chicken and not seafood. Very tasty.

Our waitress was exceptional. She checked on us every 10 minutes or so and made sure to bring us more bread and water when needed. We did not need to ask for anything. For the entree I ordered the filet mignon kabob with greek potatoes and it was excellent. The meat is aged, so it is very tender. The manager/owner came by towards the end to ensure we had a good meal.

Unfortunately, I did not have room for dessert, but I will definitely be back to try it as I am sure it is as good as the rest of their menu. I believe they also have live music on certain evenings and would like to experience that as well. Having been to several Greek restaurants in the past (primarily in Greektown, &amp; few other suburbs) I have to say this place is one of the best. The food is fresh not microwaved, and the restaurant is very clean. No flies flying around the place either. You can see into the kitchen through glass as well which is a plus.

Our server was congenial, helpful and just chatty enough. But the bread service was cold and bland, my kebabs suffered from under-seasoning and over-oiling. The cheesecake was equally bland and the crust soggy.  My companions were content, but no one raved. Altogether, it was all very much bland and not memorable. 

It&#39;s easy to compensate for mediocrity with generous portion size, and this seems to be the case. Mr. Basil - how about paring back the plates and upping the quality? Then I will consider another visit."

It went from Italian to Greek...and some Italian. The waiter was very friendly and the place was crowded but surprisingly the wait wasn&#39;t that long.  The food is very tasty. The calamari was not too tough and tasted very fresh. The chicken flatbread was one of the best I&#39;ve tasted, very light sauce delicious with enough chicken to satisfy you for a meal even though its an appetizer. We were celebrating a friend&#39;s birthday party and decided to share our dishes like family style so I got to taste everything.  The chicken kabobs, chicken pasta, gyros plate and chicken fetuccini Alfredo. The chicken kabobs were slightly salty but still a 4. The gyros needed another pita...there was a lot of meat.  The chicken alfredo was not too saucy and had fresh asparagus and surprisingly tomatoes....I guess im used to Olive Garden alfredo but this was a good change.  My favorite was the chicken pasta...very tasty. At first I thought its kinda expensive but they give pretty large portions so its definitely worth the money. Overall a great experience and I will definitely return."

Well I went today for lunch and had a blast. The aroma of wood-fire oven and amazing Greek dishes wafted as I entered. The new entrance is much more diner-friendly and prevents drafts.

The menu is tiny in format size, but deceptively so, as it is very comprehensive when it comes to dishes! And boy do these cover the gamut of delicious Greek delicacies!

For my lunch, I had the dandelion greens salad (olive oil and two lemon wedges), a side of skordalia (potato and heavy garlic), and a side of broiled octopus (with chives and a light balsamic drizzle). 

Everything was delicious, freshly made, and I couldn&#39;t have asked for more. This is the perfect mediterranean diet place.

The iced tea was lovely, and made from scratch--tasted like real tea should and without too much ice. Their bread is the classic style with the sesame seeds.

I was full but wanted to take a look at their dessert menu, and decided on an all-time favorite: the creme caramel. It was deliciously creamy and didn&#39;t taste pre-manufactured. Not terribly caramelly--has a sort of white liquid drizzled over it--but it is delicious nonetheless.

Good adult beverage selection. Lovely redesign of the interior decor to a Greek ocean blue and tasteful table settings.

I can&#39;t wait to bring my parents and significant-other unit! A little more affordable than Greek Islands, and a notch above the bistro-style Tassos in downtown Naperville.

If you love Greek food, you must try this place. It&#39;s a hidden gem."

So armed with a $20 gift certificate from that event and off to meet my friend who lives closer to Aurora than I do - I went to visit Basil&#39;s to see what the place was all about.

I arrived and noticed that the decor lacked the usual blue and white colors that come with most Greek restaurants - I was good with that - the ambiance was pretty pleasant. It was a Friday so they also had a musician playing a &#34;Greek guitar&#34; - he kept rolling through most of the night. Good stuff all in all.

As for the food, it is priced a little higher than what you&#39;d expect in an ordinary Greek restaurant, maybe $2- $3 per entree. We ordered their version of kolokothakia with skordalia. They use eggplant in addition to zucchini and it was pretty good. The skordalia was on a par with any other I have ever had. I ordered spanokopita and it came out on a plate with Greek potatoes. The spanokopita was made like a small &#34;loaf&#34; and cut in half. Pretty good, but a little pricey at $14. My friend ordered a mahi-mahi dish that came out like a casserole. He said it wasn&#39;t as firm as he would have expected and the order itself wasn&#39;t quite what he anticipated, but overall the dish was good.

We ate at the bar and the bartender, Maggie did a nice job! With the gift certificate it was a decent deal - without it Greek Islands in Lombard may have been a better option. I&#39;ll probably try Basil&#39;s again if I&#39;m in the area."

Nice and loud so you can really talk at your table and laugh. The menu is wonderful with a variety of options for everyone. Really reasonable prices for a semi-formal restaurant. It&#39;s the type of restaurant where you know the food is cooked by a chef and not just a cook. Only negative is that I think I might have eaten some bad scallops. Had two pieces of it that tasted and smelled like hair dye. The server had them make me a new dish with just the shrimp. Had the shrimp and scallops dish. I&#39;m not sick yet so I think it&#39;s all good. They really do try to make your experience a nice one. Would definitely recommend for date night.

I had the longest day at work and decided on my way home that I did not want to cook and a relaxed sit down meal and a drink would be perfect. I drive by this Mexican restaurant with a sign over the door that says &#34;the best margaritas in town&#34;. Right then it hits me, Mexican sounds perfect! I pull in and the first thing I do is check Yelp, so-so reviews and it says the restaurant is open til 10pm, it&#39;s 9:10pm so once again everything seems good, until I go in....,
   Now my parents owned a restaurant back East for over 20 years and the first half of my life was spent working in it. I know what it&#39;s like when everyone is ready to close up and go home and that party of two walks in at 5 minutes to close. That being said I got a healthy stink eye from the bartender when I walked in, a friendly hostess eventually came over and seated me. The same girl came right back to see if I was ready, I wasn&#39;t but i didn&#39;t mind putting a rush on things. I asked what the best margarita was as she said &#34;I&#39;m sorry the bartender closed the bar&#34;!! What! I was shocked, it was 9:20 and it was stated in several places that they served until 10! I told her how ridiculous that was and she went over to bar and exchanged words with bartender. She came back and said sorry. I said clearly you guys want to go home and I will go elseware. She said sorry again, and I said I can&#39;t imagine your manager would close the bar down an hour before the kitchen and headed for exit. At that point she said, I could grab you a beer! I said maybe next time and left. Headed to the larger chain Mexican restaurant down the road where they were more than happy to serve me.
 Sorry so long winded but I have a couple last things to point out. The hostess/waitress was young and actually very nice. I know what it&#39;s like to be pushed around by older staff, like bartender. There are so many food options out there that we don&#39;t need to settle for places that don&#39;t want our business. I was really excited when I pulled in.............."

I told the waitress I was surprised they would serve store bought and not homemade guacamole. They should have been honest. She did take the $3.50 off my bill. I also think the refried beans were from a can and not homemade. My friend had ordered a skirt steak and it was rubbery and chewy. We also had to wait quite awhile and had to ask twice for a to go box. This restaurant has gone down hill and we will be going to other Mexican restaurants in the area from now on. I used to come to this restaurant quite often and was so surprised that the portion size was also so much less then it used to be.

This used to be a fantastic Mexican place to go ... fun atmosphere, impeccable service, cheap, good drinks and amazing food. 

Well not anymore.  

Tonight we were seated at a table where someone&#39;s cane was perched (and remained there the whole time), waited about 10 mins for waters, ordered fajitas with corn and flour tortillas, and soup.  Drank our water with our chips and salsa and waited about 20-mins for our food, not bad but she forgot my soup and our water. And the corn tortillas. And the extra napkins we asked for, three times. And this sauce we couldn&#39;t remember the name of which, we described as an oil-based sauce that goes on steak, and she brought a cream-based sauce (that she charged us $1.29 for without even asking if it was the right sauce.  She brought my soup, the tortillas, and *some* water, but she used one pitcher to fill all the other tables first, so she ran-out of it by the time she got to us and said she&#39;d bring more. We asked for the napkins again. She left to get them, ten minutes later, she appears to sang &#34;Happy Birthday&#34; with a group with other servers. Then she left without checking in us -- or anyone else. Never brought napkins. No water. Ten minutes more to wait for a box and our check while she&#39;s chatting at the hostess stand. And another eight minutes to bring back the receipt. 

She was either oblivious to the fact that she was an awful server, or she didn&#39;t give a sh*t. I&#39;m going with the latter. 

Really sucks bc the food is great and the drinks are awesome, but the service has gone downhill over the years, and now it&#39;s just the worst.  Tonight was the worst service I&#39;ve gotten there. And I took someone there who heard me raaaave about Friaco&#39;s for like a year.

I got the steak taco dinner, It was absolutely huge! and delicious.  3 tacos stuffed w/ topping, beans, rice, 2 salsas that came in mini hard shell edible taco bowls, a pico de gallo salad.  Free chips and salsa.  I initially thought 13.99$  was pricey for a mexican dinner, but boy was I wrong!  Worth every penny, even my very picky friend had a hard time finding a negative.  She had problems understanding the waitress, I did not.  What was killing me was how FRESH the toppings were! I will for sure be back to this place."

The cheese in the enchiladas was hard, not melted. My carne asada was dry and as thin as jerky, and the tostadas never mind about those. The only thing good about this place was our waitress, very nice and attentive. I mean I&#39;m sure there will be people that will like this place but if you&#39;re looking for authentic Mexican food id say you would be better off at Taco Bell."

Good salsa and chips. The chicken crispy taco was a generous portion but the beef enchilada dinner was nothing special and almost bland just being mostly beef wrapped in a flour tortilla.  The side of guacamole was very small for the extra money and rather thin. Overall a comfortable atmosphere but for the money I would probably try someplace else next time.

I was completely disappointed. The horchata was disgusting. I LOVE horchata and this one did not taste right. I ordered a chicken quesadilla. The presentation was alright but my tomatoes on the side were complete mush. As soon as I bit in, I could tell the chicken tasted frozen. I asked the waitress to please find out when the chicken was cooked and how its stored. She didnt even come back to tell me, the manager came over and asked what the problem was. She studdered through all her sentences as if she wasnt even sure of her answers. Very unconfident about the food. I sent it back to the kitchen . Very disappointed in the food.

The Tejas margaritas leave no doubt that there is a liberal pour of tequila used. The service is always fast and friendly and the food is served piping hot. I really enjoyed the chipotle fish tacos. The homemade chipotle sauce was spicy and flavorful without inflicting pain. Each taco was adorned with a very generous wedge of ripe avocado. Unlike some other local places the food here is not swimming in grease. My only gripe is that the fish is not the star of the dish. Chopped up too small and a bit too &#34;fishy&#34; tasting, not in a good way.

Half a month later and my favorite meal is the Pollo Chipotle with a side of the Poblano Mole sauce. The chipotle adds a nice counterpunch to the sweetness from the mole.  Add in the guacamole, pico de gallo, sour cream and frijoles con queso with flour tortillas and it&#39;s heavenly."

We were seated in what I would consider their private party room to the right side of the restaurant. We had a group of close to twenty people.

They brought us chips and salsa which were good then took our drink our. Took a while for our drinks to come. We knew it was gonna be a bad idea to stay there any longer and order food because of the time it took to deliver our drinks and the fact that there was only one server assigned to a table of 20.

We asked the server for our check for 2 margaritas. She left and never came back. I had to look for her and she was on a POS system entering an order. We finally had to get the manager involved and he explained that they don&#39;t separate checks.

OK.... I understand it&#39;s a hassle to have separate checks for a large party. We were never told we couldn&#39;t have separate checks nor is it stated on their menu or anywhere in the restaurant. All she had to do was remove 2 margaritas from the tab which they did after a good 20 minutes waiting.

The table ordered their meal as we were leaving. This was around 7:40. I heard later on from those that stayed behind that their meals didn&#39;t hit the table until 8:30.

We also noticed that it wasn&#39;t very busy on the way out. Just 4 tables and our big party. Why couldn&#39;t the other two servers or at least one, come over and attend to our table. They had plenty of time to stand at the podium and chit chat with each other.

The food here isn&#39;t bad. I&#39;ve been here before and that&#39;s why I agreed to go there for this birthday party. I would go back on slow night, maybe, but definitely not host an event there."

I eat at Friaco¬¥s quite frequently and my friends and I love going there for lunch. We like benefiting from their lunch prices. The staff is always very welcoming and friendly. 

My favorite dish is chicken fajitas and I have never been disappointed with that choice. I also like their quesadillas.

-Margaritas = good
-Quesadillas = FANTASTIC
-Free chips &amp; salsa (salsa is perfect!)
-Latin music

CONS:
-Service can be slow if you&#39;re in a group
-Chimichanga was terrible

Overall, friendly service and good food.  If you&#39;re crusing down Route 59 and want Mexican, it&#39;s a more inexpensive choice than On the Border (but OTB has better margaritas however VERY Americanized Mexican food there).

One day my friend called to meet up at Friacos for their happy hour specials. He ordered the monster margarita and I had a huge stein of draft beer for about $9 each. Along with that we were both offered the free taco bar and chips with salsa. The taco bar was nothing special. In fact, the meat tasted a little too greasy and the tortillas were stale. But hey, who can complain when it&#39;s free? And when you&#39;re drinking, food flavor really isn&#39;t that important; it&#39;s just something to soak up the liquor. 

The second time I went here (for a proper dinner), I tried the monster margarita. This thing is the size of a big round dinner plate. It&#39;s huge and well worth the money. It&#39;s also great, just don&#39;t expect to be driving yourself home afterwards. I&#39;m not a lightweight drinker and I felt it kick in hard about halfway during the meal. The food was good. I ordered the beef enchilada, chicken taco and beef burrito. They&#39;re pretty solid on the flavor and the portions are big. And yes, I love the little bowls of salsa with the chips because I&#39;m a double dipper and chip hog as well. The waiter was attentive and friendly (though he was pushing me to order another margarita. You have to be kidding. I&#39;m not that much of a lush). 

I wouldn&#39;t call it the best Mexican food I&#39;ve ever had. But when those taco/enchilada/burrito cravings kick in, Friacos is a good bet in this area."

I went there for my second time about a week ago. I was with a large party so I was trying to be a little understanding when it came to our service. I arrived around 6:30pm and the place had about 3 tables in the main area and then our party in the back (about 25 of us). (The host of our party called ahead a week in advance) We sat around chit chatting among each other for about 30 minutes when the server came around asking for our drink orders. We received our drinks about 25 minutes later. The server came back about 15 minutes later for our food order. At that time, I knew we weren&#39;t going to getting our food within an hour wait so I decided to hang out and asked for my check for my drink. As the server finished up the orders, I expected my check within 15-20 minutes (to give her enough time to put the food orders in). After waiting, I noticed there were a couple other servers talking and laughing with each other. They were standing around not doing anything. I was starting to wonder why they weren&#39;t helping with our party... Our service was starting to suffer, and there were other servers there that could have helped. After waiting and waiting for the ticket I asked for 45 minutes ago, I finally went to the front of the restaurant where the manager was standing. I asked him for my check because I was ready to go. I explained to him how long I have been waiting he told me he could not split up the checks and I would have to pay with the entire party. I became frustrated and asked him why this was noted on the menu, or said to me when I initially asked for my check. He had a blank stare on his face and started speaking in Spanish to the server that was at our table. After going back and forth he printed me out my receipt for my drink. The rest of the party had to wait quite some time for their food and said that they paying process was a headache. I understand that it&#39;s a pain to split up checks. However, I feel like this should be noted somewhere so that people can plan on making payment arrangements. I would never go back to this place. What an awful experience. I was there for 2 hours and had 1 drink and then had to fight for my bill."

Keeping that in mind as I stepped into Friaco&#39;s, I ordered a variety of things to just try them out.  

The interior is pretty generic Lalo&#39;s-like Mexican chain place.  I did like the cactus guy on the table with the buggy eyes.  My husband looked a little nervous like we were going to hate the food but I stuck it out.

A basket of chips and a good amount of salsa came out right away along with 1/2 price margaritas (the special on Tuesday) which put the marg at $2.75.  Not a bad price at all.  It wasn&#39;t the best margarita I&#39;ve had for sure but it was about what I expected...margarita mix and fruity but pretty heavy on the booze which was appreciated after a long day of work!  

The chips were great.  Not too thin but not thick and heavy.  I really liked them and the salsa was good too.  I often don&#39;t eat many of the chips and salsa (like back at Garcia&#39;s in Lincoln Square I usually skipped them because they were so heavy) but I couldn&#39;t stop myself.

I had the tres amigos combo with a mole enchilada with chicken, a friaco&#39;s enchilada with chicken and a shredded beef taco.  The enchiladas were fairly forgettable.  They weren&#39;t bad but they weren&#39;t all that great either.  That taco, though, was so delicious!  It was so tender and juicy and filled with great flavor.  Whatever they did to that meat they deserve a round of applause.  I loved it.

My husband had the carnitas plate which came out with a few huge hunks of pork and the fixings for making your own tacos.  It was ok - not what we were expecting from carnitas we&#39;ve had before - but not horrible.

Our waitress was so nice and sweet.  She seemed to know a lot of the customers which was nice.  She was very attentive. At the end of the meal we were and I mentioned that the shredded beef taco was great.  She mentioned the queso appetizer and I said, &#34;Oh yeah, I saw some folks on Yelp saying that was great.  I&#39;ll have to try it next time!&#34;  She told me to wait one moment and she came back with a fresh basket of chips and a plate of the queso with shredded beef on top.  Even though I was so full I managed to snarf down several bites and would have to agree it was pretty tasty stuff.  If you&#39;re the type to like queso dips you&#39;re going to like this one for sure!

All in all, I think I might not be back here that often but if I do,  I&#39;m going to stick with that taco I loved."

This place gets only 1 star because of the bar mainly.  If you order a margarita, it comes from a plastic gallon bottle.  They do not mix their own.  If you order a pitcher of them, you may as well ask for the gallon bottle to be brought to your table.

So far all the Mexican restaurants we&#39;ve hit have been some degree of disappointing, ranging from &#34;Ehh, that could have been better&#34; to &#34;Man, that SUCKED!!&#34;  Friaco&#39;s was a fairly solid entry in the pantheon; here&#39;s the lowdown:

- Good queso! It was queso blanco (white cheese), not Velveeta, and was seemingly free of pico de gallo, yet still had some kind of spice to it. We wolfed that down with the slightly thick yet small chips, being grateful that it didn&#39;t have ground meat in it [what IS with the &#34;queso fundido&#34; craze up here??] 

- Drinks. I had a strawberry margarita, which had NO liquor in it whatsoever (I am a lightweight and got no buzz at all, nor even detected a whiff of booze); the taste was a bit odd, fruity at first but a chemically finish. Also, the salt rim was table salt rather than kosher. VERY salty! The folks had sangria, which they enjoyed. 

- Dinner. I ordered steak fajitas, which were a bit overcooked and thus slightly tough, but had a good flavor, and I was offered an option of corn or flour tortillas. Parents enjoyed their chicken fajita burrito and beef enchiladas respectively. 

- Dessert. Fried ice cream. A fist-sized scoop of vanilla battered and fried, then set in a fluted, cinnamoned tortilla shell, festooned with whipped cream. We made short work of that, let me tell you. Even my father, who claimed he didn&#39;t need any dessert, ate about half of it. 

The decor is bright, with tables and booths carved and painted with flowers and the restautant&#39;s name. The service was generally prompt and good, though we lost our waiter a bit toward the end (more patrons were starting to arrive at this point; unfortunately, it was also when we were looking for our bill). 

Overall, not the best Tex-Mex I&#39;ve ever had, but certainly a lot better than some of the stuff in this area. Reasonable prices, especially drink specials. I would return."

Salsa is good.
Chimichangas are good.
Margaritas are good
Pina coladas are good.

There&#39;s nothing about Friaco&#39;s that really jumps out and screams authentic Mexican cuisine, but I like it because they have good food at good prices and good service as well.

I recommend coming here for some margaritas and a bite to eat after some shopping at Westfield Fox Valley mall, which it&#39;s conveniently located next to.

The beef enchiladas were well seasoned, but nothing extraordinary. What made this place worth it was the excellent jumbo margaritas- 7.99 on a Saturday night- as well as pretty much everything else.

The place is well designed. Booths, tables and heavy chairs have flower and themed carvings. The bar seems to be sunken into the center of the restaurant because it&#39;s surrounded by higher level booths and tables. 

I loved the chips which are thick and not salty and the salsa which is smooth with a definite spicy kick to it. 

The service was excellent, and we could tell the managers were watchful all night. After two of us sat for well over an hour our server wasn&#39;t annoyed as he had a right to be, (it was pretty busy, though no wait), instead he gave us a free desert! It might have also been because we were on our third margaritas and an $80 tab :) but excellent service none the less.

Incredibly weak and tasteless. The food was terrible also. Two of us got taco salads which were both very watery and lacking in ingredients.

The &#34;cheese dip&#34; is PHENOMENAL. My boyfriend and I clear nearly two baskets of chips (which are light, crisp, &amp; amazingly delish) every time we get the cheese. My boyfriend says they have the perfect salsa, a good mix of saucy &amp; chunky with a medium spice. 

We have had the fajitas, nearly every &#34;Friaco&#39;s&#34; named special (Friaco&#39;s Burrito, Friaco&#39;s Chimi, etc.), and have not once had a single complaint. The rice is average, but the beans are great. The steak and chicken marinades are flavorful and everything has a little *kick* to it (not to be confused with &#34;hot&#34; or &#34;spicy&#34; it is noticeable but mildly so) which is how I feel Mexican food should be. You cannot go wrong with this menu, there are options for everyone, including the kiddies.

Service has always been great. We have had a different server each time, and believe the manager actually served us this last Monday. They are always polite, swift, attentive, eager to refill your drink/chips/salsa and make sure everything is going great! 

Bottom line: With so many commercial (On the Border) and sketchy (El Famous Burrito) Mexican restaurants in the Aurora/Naperville area, go for the only one guaranteed to give you great food and great service every time - Friaco&#39;s!"

They give us chips and salsa, which were good. I was there with my fiance and son. We order about $60 worth of food and a couple of horchatas (rice water). The horchatas were good nothing special. This was our first time here so we decided to try a little bit of everything. We ordered tacos, a burrito, a chimichanga, quesadilla, and a enchilada. We didn&#39;t wait long before our food was ready. I tried the burrito and my fiance tried the enchilada and we were in horror. It was the most disgusting thing I have ever tasted. The meat was so dry and chewy and had an awful taste. Also, they were both plain. The burrito was just a cold tortilla with a nasty pieces of steak. We called the waitress over and asked her to look at our food. She felt embarrassed and said she never eats any of the food there. She was very nice and called the manager over. He apologized and said they always serve their burritos that way. When I showed him the burrito his face turned beet red. He told us we wouldn&#39;t be charged anything even for the drinks. So, we ended up leaving without eating more than a bite. If you want good authentic Mexican food...PLEASE DON&#34;T GO HERE!!!!! If I was the owner I would be embarrassed to own this place. On a good note the staff was very nice too bad they work at such a horrible restaurant. 

BTW: I am shocked at the good reviews calling this place authentic and good. I am Mexican and no this place a NO NO!!!! You know there&#39;s something wrong when the staff won&#39;t eat the food!"

 I will tell you what authentic is, authentic is when the beans aren&#39;t out of a can, but actual beans, that look like beans, with bits of pork stewed together with onions and tomatoes. Authentic margarita? Uh, no. This was mixer margarita. The meat was tough, the enchilada was disgusting.

A few friends and I had dinner here yesterday and it was worth it.  All of us love Mexican (authentic) food, and while this may not be the best we&#39;ve ever had, we each were pleased with what we tried.  The salsa had a zippy flavor and the chips were appreciated while we waited.  
Actually, I arrived late, but as soon as the server saw me, he came by to fill a drink order and was back with refills when he saw we were close to needing one.  
The fajitas, chimichanga and the tamales were on our order.  Each was served with rice (again, not the best I&#39;ve had but ok...) and either refried beans or charro beans (like a bean soup).  My only disappointment was that they don&#39;t have black beans, which would have been my preference.  
We stayed late to talk but had so much to eat that we didn&#39;t try a dessert.  While it was busy, it wasn&#39;t overly crowded or loud while we were there.  It was a comfortable setting for conversasion.

Last night was my second trip to Friaco&#39;s. The first time I went, I was very impressed. The drinks were above average, and the chicken fajitas I ordered were perfectly cooked, while not being too greasy. The chips and salsa were also excellent.

So, last night some friends and I were jonesing for Mexican food, so we decided to head over to Friaco&#39;s. The drinks were good, although this time I was a little disappointed in the lack of fruity goodness in my sangria. The chips and individual bowls of salsa were delicious as before and the bowls are great for double-dipping.

Now on to the main dish. There were 5 of us, and the waiter didn&#39;t write any of our orders down. I am always afraid when this occurs. Well, my fear was realized. Two dishes were screwed up, one even to the point where it had to be sent back. I ordered the chicken fajita burrito this time, which was ok, but I was wishing I had ordered the fajitas themselves again. The BF ordered chicken nachos, which were very good. Others ordered the fajita chicken salad (review: it was good but soggy), colorado chile chicken (review: excellent), and a combination dish (review: ok). 

Overall, I would still go back, but I&#39;m not as excited about Friaco&#39;s as the first time I went."

The chips and salsa were fresh, and it was nice that we each got our own little bowl for salsa.  That way, we could double dip as much as we wanted to.

When the waiter came to take our order, he didn&#39;t write anything down.  I&#39;ve found in the past that sometimes this works out much better than expected, but often it&#39;s better if they just write it down.  There were 5 of us so it was a fairly large order, but this was definitely one of those cases where he should have written it down.  A few of our orders were not quite right, and one actually had to be sent back.  The waiter took it back without a problem and promptly brought out the correct item, though.  

The drinks were fine.  The food was very good.  I had the chicken fajita salad.  It was very flavorful.  The fajita meat was excellent, however somehow the salad was very soupy.  I guess it was more fajita than salad, but in the bottom of the shell-bowl, there was a pool of juices, queso, and probably melted sour cream.  It was tasty, but a little weird.  I will definitely try something else next time, and there will be a next time because the chicken and the queso were so tasty."

Soon after walking in I knew this wasn&#39;t going to be a good experience. Went up to the greeter&#39;s desk and had 3 young ladies look at me and my party as if they had no idea why we were there. FINALLY one of them asked how many. Told her how many were in my party, she acknowledged and walked away. WALKED AWAY! No I&#39;ll be right back or please wait a moment, nothing. Everyone in my party looked at each other with quizzical looks, like, did that just happen? After 10 minutes of waiting another girl finally decided to seat us. This is in a 3/4 empty restaurant now! I won&#39;t go into all the details of the dinner and service but I&#39;ll highlight a few. Waitress never ONCE said yes please or  thank you or sorry (which she should of through the whole experience). Just a little manners goes a long way. Waitress didn&#39;t know what term &#39;beer on tap&#39; meant. Didn&#39;t know what drafts were available and instructed me to look at the bar menu on the table, under the drafts section of the menu it read &#34;please ask your server&#34;. OH THE IRONY! When I read that out loud to her she laughed and said &#34;that&#39;s funny&#34; then proceeded to stare at me like &#34;so...what kinda beer do you want?&#34;. She didn&#39;t have clue to even think of asking another server or going to the bar to ask. First drink order took at least 15 minutes. Food order was taking so long that we ordered another round of drinks. Second drink order didn&#39;t come to our table till we were all done with our food. Food quality was poor at best. Very small portions for the price. Not a very good value. No one ever cleaned up our plates after we were done eating. Waitress disappeared for 30 minutes when we needed our check. As I said, I would only highlight a few. Many other service, decor, cleanliness issues I could have gone into.

I have to believe that the only reason this place is still open is due to the clientele they serve there in Naperville. The types who wouldn&#39;t know good Mexican food or service if their BMW SUVs with child seats depended on it.

 I was physically sick for 24 hours after eating here. NO JOKE!"

My fiance and I, having a craving for some Mexican and he having been there before, set out on the 20-25 minute trip to Friaco&#39;s.  We were greeted by a young lady immediately upon entering.  We were seated at a booth next to an already occupied booth (they were already mid-meal) and adjacent to several other in progress tables with her parting comment being that our server would be right with us.  As soon as our bottoms hit the seat chips and salsa were on the table, delivered by a different young lady, her parting comment was also, your server will be right with you.  Evidently they had been misinformed.  No server, EVER.  We checked out the menu, decided on drinks, fiance hit the restroom, five minutes passed; servers attended to the aforementioned adjacent tables, but nothing for us.  I headed to the host stand to see if maybe we ended up in a &#34;dead zone&#34;, but when I got there all the service personnel that I had seen milling about the dining room only moments before had vanished, not one person was available to even ask about getting some service.  I returned to the table and almost immediately servers were again at the tables around us, but still not one person came to our table, even having made eye contact with a server from a distance too far to make verbal contact.  It had be a solid 10 minutes, and I am being generous in their favor.  We decided clearly our business was not wanted so we got up to leave.  Probably the most irritating part of the situation was that we passed the young lady who sat us on our way out and she looked at us, smiled and said thank you!  Really Friaco&#39;s??

2.  Menu has changed, spinach aren&#39;t on the menu so I tried the spinach quesadilla.  It wasn&#39;t a fresh spinach item, it was mixed with some type of something to make it white and creamy, like creamed spinach gone wrong.

3. A pet peeve is going to a restaurant and smelling like grease/food when you leave.  Last night was awful, clothes, hair, coat, the inside of my purse.....even my husband commented.

The air conditioner was set to arctic circle, and since I hadn&#39;t brought my parka with me I was a bit chilly.

I enjoyed the salsa and chips quite a bit. Individual salsa bowls make for a nice touch.The menu is full of typical Mexican fare that you&#39;d find at any tex-mex type place; if you&#39;re a frequent Mexican food eater, you can likely order without seeing the menu.

I was happy to see that they had beef tongue, so I went with that. It was flavorful, cooked decently, and there was a lot of it. The particular style cut they used wasn&#39;t especially to my liking; it was a bit thin. Given that it&#39;s so rare to find tongue on a menu, I&#39;d order it again. I enjoyed it, and certainly left with a full tummy."

Having only been in IL for 2 years now and having grown up in Texas, I can still savor the flavor of a lot of authentic Mexican food and your traditional Tex-Mex fare.  I cannot say that Friacos is bad in anyway.  It is very different from the food that I accustomed to, but they will make enchiladas with corn tortillas if you ask, and everything else is standard fare.  I will be honest here in stating that I have only tried 2 different menu items as I am EXTREMELY picky about my Tex-Mex, but of the items I tried they were not bad.  When I need a break from making my own salsa and cooking my own Tex-Mex, Friaco&#39;s is my first thought (and trust me when I say we have tried A LOT of Mexican food restaurants and still fall back on Friaco&#39;s)."

I&#39;ve had panda express in malls before or other random locations, and this one is the best one that I&#39;ve been too by far. 

First of all, I love the fact that they are ALWAYS cooking something or bringing something from the kitchen, which means that the food there is usually fresh because a lot of people stop by. I have never been here without waiting a good 10-15 minutes for some sort of chicken or veggie dish. I always tell them that I don&#39;t mind waiting for a new batch because I don&#39;t like Chinese food ( yes, even panda-styled Chinese food) lukewarm.

While I have never eaten in, I always go inside to order my food so I don&#39;t know how the drive through is. The inside is very clean, can serve a large party or two, and plenty of tables for people to sit in."

The guy said they had some chow mein, fried rice, orange chicken, one order of Kau Pung Chicken and one spring roll, that was pretty much it for the night. 
We&#39;ve noticed that Panda has tasty food but cuts corners like this and they all give small portions. Their food isn&#39;t fresh- most of it is frozen shipped in from corporate and heated in a wok to make it look better. Closing early and not having sufficient product to make it easier to clean up and get out of there quick is poor management."

If you don&#39;t have kids, it&#39;s easy to think, &#34;just get out and go inside,&#34; but to avoid the whole *out of the car seats, through the cold, into the warmth, get the food, have to potty, back through the cold, back into the car seat* thing is nice once in a while. Even better when the kids are sleeping.

So I&#39;ve never actually been inside. But the drive thru experience has met my expectations, and the food is always fresh and delicious. They will let you know if they need to cook something to order, and then you may need to wait a few minutes. Fine by me for freshly steamed veggies or extra hot shrimp. Mmm I&#39;m getting hungry.

I checked the sign on the front door and the dining room is supposed to be open until 9pm. I hesitantly went to the drive thru because I was afraid I would get food that&#39;s been sitting out for too long. I ordered 3 (2-entree) dishes. I wanted the orange chicken and string beans with chicken on all three orders. They said they only had enough for 1 order of string beans. Sure enough, when I got home, the string beans were all shriveled, onions burnt, and really salty. I would&#39;ve never ordered the string beans if I had seen it in the dining room."

Obviously if you want authentic Chinese food, don&#39;t come here. But I mean, for a quick lunch break, and when you have a craving, this place does the trick. In my opinion though this place is a little over priced. With the amount of meat you get that is (I always get the orange chicken). I usually try and wait for them to introduce a new item to the menu because they they give it to you for free. Then it&#39;s like a 2 for 1 combo special.

The new building is nice, but you would think they would have more seating. They have some booths, but during lunch, some people eat alone. So a table that should fit 6 is being hogged by one person. I&#39;m guilty of this too, but luckily as I got my food, these two people were leaving a table. From the outside it looks like there&#39;s two floors, but no, it&#39;s just a high ceiling.

First there isn&#39;t any other fast food Chinese restaurants that I can even think of.  The food is pretty good for being fast food but 2 hours later you think maybe you should have ate healthier.  

The Orange Chicken &amp; Hot &amp; Sour Soup are always good.  I also like that they tend to have new items on the menu pretty frequently.

The Shanghai Angus Steak was cooked beautifully, and it seemed to be seasoned just right. And the Honey Walnut Shrimp were nice and crispy. Dad&#39;s stuff was yummy too.

The atmosphere is nice, with a high ceiling and a wall facing the street made completely out of glass. There is some music playing softly in the background, at a nice volume that is hearable  not too hearable.

My coworker is a vegetaian so we knew there would most likely be vegetarian options.  

The restaurant, itself, is decorated in tasteful traditional italian flair.  Very elegant with white table cloths and napkins folded to look like rosettes.  Bread was served with a tomatoe paste that we could mix with olive oil.  It had just enough zing to delight your taste buds!!  (We later purchased a pint of it for $3.50 to take back with us to Dallas, TX).  

I ordered the Rigatoni Vita Mia.  The waitress recommended a special veggie &amp; pasta dish, not on the menu, for my vegetarian co-worker.  I&#39;ve never seen such huge noodles!!  Most times large noodles are really mushy but the rigatoni vita mia was perfect al dente.  Our waitress shared that it was a very old family recipe.  The noodles were complimented with a ground sausage &amp; vodka sauce.  My co-worker raved about her pasta as well.  Our only regret was that there was so much that we couldn&#39;t finish it.  Since we are traveling, we couldn&#39;t take the leftovers with us.  I eould have loved to try a dessert but I had completely filled up with the pasta.  

Service was quick &amp; efficient and our waitress was very knowledgeable of the menu.  I&#39;m glad this  restaurant is not closer to home because I could easily forsee gaining an extra 10 pounds from the delicious pasta!!"

Any business must disclose all charges prior to swiping your card and processing your transaction. Capri Sogno will give you one receipt, and bill you another. I have given them a chance to prove my order was mistaken with another, but they don&#39;t care, they already have my money. ***

Good food, but shady business practices. Be sure to check your bill for hidden charges.

My group got check for $50 so give him card, and it&#39;s swiped for $55, an extra $5 from the original bill? 

Why, you may ask? The reason for the error, or so I was told, was that the upstairs and downstairs dining areas have different POS systems, and my order was confused with another party&#39;s 

After speaking to the chef/owner, he confirmed the waiter lied, and there is only ONE POS system , and he confirmed that the waiter probably made a mistake. 

So, what does he do? He says his waiter made a mistake, and the error is on me. Makes no senses, apparently Capri sogno customers are responsible for their waiters mistakes. Service is totally sub par here, which is a shame since the food is good. I keep wanting to come back,  but may not be coming back anymore"

We&#39;ve walked up and down Lockport many a time and said numerous times we should stop; Well tonight we did. The Mrs and I came here on our anniversary and we&#39;re not disappointed at all.  First things first- only the downstairs is open on the weekdays so seating is limited to @10 tables and the bar. So I would suggest reservations or get there before 7 like we did.  There is plenty of outdoor seating which is very nicely done.  People were rolling in when we left at 8, and I completely understand why- Food and service were outstanding.  
The staff was very attentive, knowledgeable about the menu, and beyond polite.  Our server Melissa recommended 2 dishes and she was spot on.  We were asked countless times how was the food and if we needed anything.  The atmosphere downstairs was extremely cozy and white linen while yet not being presumptuous.  Nice sized and well appointed Bar should you need to wait.  (Mrs and I said we&#39;d eat at the Bar if no seating was available.) 
Let&#39;s start at at the beginning for the food.  The bread is what I&#39;d class as Arthur Ave in the Bronx Italian bead good. (fellow NY&#39;ers will understand) And yes the Oil and Cheese are already on the table.  On Melissa&#39;s suggestion we had the Calamari alla Capri for an appetizer which was very good.  The sauce made the dish and the fry wasn&#39;t heavy at all. The serving was more than enough for 2 and perhaps even 4
Dinner time (getting full)  I had the Pollo Limone and one again the sauce was very good.  You get the pasta, in this case Mostaccioli, on the side with Red sauce.  Personally I&#39;d suggest angel hair on the plate mixed with the sauce.  Hindsight being 20/20 I should have asked for that.  I&#39;ll do so when we go back.  My dish was $16. Mrs had had was the &#34;daily special&#34; which was called the fish special. A white flake fish sitting on a bed of green-beans with a butter/lemon sauce. Portion size was large and filling
The staff heard it was our anniversary so presented us with a slice of chocolate heaven.  I have no idea what it was, but holy crap it was good.
We had the appetizer, two entries, coffee, 5 glasses of wine, one mixed drink for $125 including tax and tip. 
Side note- this is Italian Italian, not Americanized Italian.  There is a ton of seafood on the menu.  The folks next to us had The Potato Vesuvio appetizer which looked to be a meal in itself.   We will be back and already have the Gnocchi Bolognese and 
Rigatoni di Casa targeted for the next meal.
My only suggestions would be to offer the pasta on the side with sauce options and not charge $10 for mixed drink.  This is the perfect place for the special date.  Downtown Chicago feel without the drive or cost.  Highly recommended."

We were seated at the table right in front of the bar and the front door.  Awful experience! It is like you are in a fish bowl being watched by the wait staff hanging around the bar as well as people standing at the front door waiting for a table.

The food was very dry and lacked flavor.  One out of the 4 dishes we ordered was liked.
Afterward, we tried to call and voice our displeasure and also wrote an email to the management and neither was ever responded to.

Let me set the stage; Saturday 6:30 PM, sit outside with our best friends for a nice meal.  We order some sangria, a bottle of wine and some apps.  Apps were good.  Waitress explains the specials and does a hell of a job up selling the Dad&#39;s day Steak.  My friend and I order the steak, him medium and mine mid-rare (of course).  Mouth begins to water....,

Soup comes... Tasty.   Steaks arrive and I immediately cut mine in 1/2 to stop the cooking process.  Dammit....well done.  Now, if I was sitting in Chili&#39;s and I was dumb enuf to order a 16 oz ribeye I would expect to get a ruined steak.   But Capri is billed as a top notch eatery, and that comes with a responsibility.  Charge $45 for a steak, don&#39;t turn it into a hockey puck.

Sooooooo, that was a mistake, and having served in &#34;fine&#34; restaurants for 12 yrs it still wouldn&#39;t pull a 1 star from me, cuz shit happens.  But Capri then proceeded to break the cardinal rule of the service industry.

I informed my waitress of the ruined meal, and she apologized profusely.  She offered to replace it.... But with 3 toddlers, I told her that wasn&#39;t possible. I told her I would eat it but she should inform the cooks so no other patron&#39;s meal was ruined..

We finished our meal and asked for the check because it looked like rain was coming.   FULL  PRICE FOR BOTH STEAKS!!!!!!

No apology from a manager... And not a cent of discount. It is sooo  easy to fix a kitchen fuck up..... Give shit AWAY!!!  Bad food, bad management. In-excusable!


Will not be back.... 

Do yourself a favor and eat at Borolos in Joliet or any Francesca&#39;s is you want legit Italian.   You&#39;ll thank me .

Cons: Pricey, mediocre food

I&#39;ve been here twice.  Once about a year ago and it was decent and again at the end of January 2016 and it was not.

Stuffed mushroom appetizer was okay, but for $15.95 I expected a great deal more in both taste and quantity.

Pollo Limone had a great sauce, but it was a single small butterflied chicken breast .  For the price, I would expect two chicken breasts.  The pasta came on the side with only a drizzle of a flavorless marinara sauce. Not a very good presentation.

Pasta alla Mamma was okay. Unfortunately, this was something that most people can make successfully at home. When I go out to eat at a nicer restaurant I expect a dish above and beyond my basic culinary skills. 

Wine pours are measured out in little carafe glasses and poured in front of you... a little tacky and somewhat of a mechanical feel to it. 

For a dinner with two glasses of wine that was well over $70 (tip not included), I did not feel it was a good value nor did we leave the place feeling like we had just enjoyed some satisfying culinary creations."

The restaurant is very small and with that being said they do not make you feel rushed at all, it was a full evening out and each course was spaced perfectly apart so that you could enjoy dinner chat and visiting. Our server was Linsey and she was amazing. I highly recommend the mussels in the red sauce and get extra bread because that sauce is full of flavor, I can&#39;t say enough about them. They are the best mussels I think I&#39;ve ever had. Also, If you like Bloody Mary&#39;s.. Well theirs are ridiculous good!! :D 
Anything you order will no doubt be extraordinary. We absolutely love it here.. We&#39;ll be back and we would definitely recommend it to friends."

First off the bartender did not seem to know much of anything and maybe doing hair is a better option than being a bartender! The menu is a Gosh darn mess like any other Italian joint! Less is more people! On top of that two drinks cost over $30 WTF!! We had just been at hopscotch and had Mussels and shrimp cocktail and two adult beverages that added up to $37 and it was great! The icing on the cake would be this bartender having the audacity to shhhhhhh my friend and I for being excited and laughing, there was only 2 older guys in this place! Honestly I do not ever do this but his place is not worth your time and if ur a foody or cocktail enthusiast stay away!!!

Everything from the appetizers to the soup &amp; salads to the entrees and the grand finale of the Italian Ice for dessert was truly amazing !

It was our first visit and will also be the last.  Pretty uninspired dinner overall.  My wife&#39;s lasagna was pretty tasty and my mother in law said her chicken parm was pretty good.  Nothing special but both pretty decent.  I had what I hoped would be a plate of Italian deliciousness in ordering carbonara.  Looking forward to a beautiful sauce with some vegitables, Italian ham, etc.  What I got was essentially butter spaghetti noodles with cheese melted in.  What a complete disappointment.  Sent it back in favor of eggplant parm which was better but not great.  The prices on the menu indicate a much better dining experience than was delivered.  Plenty of better Italian places in the area that will get my money in the future.

The best part of the meal was probably the server who was fairly engaging, had his shtick down pat, etc.  He did a good job.  Now balance that with the hostess who had long brown hair and kept putting it in a pony tail over and over.  Not a big deal unless your table is about 3&#39; from the hostess stand.  Which ours was.  Lastly, the menu touts about 4 or 5 dishes that some food critic liked (he has apparently passed away so I am not disparaging him in any way).  I have to believe that if he was alive today and tasted the menu as a whole, he would not care to have his name associated.  Maybe an expensive bottle of wine BEFORE dinner is the way to enjoy a meal here.  Unfortunately, not a wine drinker.  Guess that ends my review and any future thoughts of returning to Capri Sogno."

The restaurant is very nice but LOUD!!!! I mean shouting across the table loud when they are busy. The service was slow, very slow. I think they either screwed up our order and didnt say anything or completely forgot about us becasue it took 45 minutes to get our food which in my opion is long for pasta.

When we sat down the waitress told me about their specials and mentioned that they had a stuffed mushroom apetizer. I love stuffed Mushrroms so of course i ordered them. 3 decent size stuffed mushrroms, pretty tasty although kind of luke warm. When the bill came $16.95!! almost 17 bucks for mushrooms... ridiculous.

I&#39;ve seen some people mention how nice the owner is... Not on my visit. He spent the entire time i was there talking with the 2 tables next to ours and never once came over to ask how our food was as a matter of fact one of the few time our waitress actually came to the table she was interupted by the owner to come over to a different table.

The food was decent but not for the money and the rest of the experience was horrible!

Bad Service
Bad Prices
Bad Atmosphere
SO so food

Dont waste your time with this place!!!!!!!!"

We are frequent diners at Capri in other locations but decided to try this adorable spot in downtown Plainfield.  

I was a  bit surprised that 1/2 the dining space is upstairs (a very long, steep set of stairs) and I&#39;m not sure if they have an elevator so if you plan to come here with anyone who has mobility issues - request a table on the main floor. 

The service was amazing - our server (I can&#39;t recall her name) was so pleasant and attentive and believe me, our table was demanding!  She and the buss staff were well coordinated and so helpful throughout the meal.  

The food was very good from the appetizers to the dessert - the portions were large so expect to have leftovers unless you share dinners.  I would say the Plainfield Capri is in the top two of the Capri restaurant family -  we will be back!"

Score! We started with a bottle of wine. No apps as we already had some wine and cheese at the house. I ordered the homemade rigatoni in a vodka sauce. The lady at the table had the linguini vongole. Both were outstanding. But my friend got the veal and eggplant. Really. I am moving in after trying this. I have to come back to taste everything on the menu. The last time I had Italian food this good was in a burrow of NY. Or at my mothers house from age 1 to 39. Four people and two bottles of vino came to a buck forty. Seriously? I told the waitress that we had a birthday at the table and the old Italian guy came and sang Happy Bird day with a lit cannoli. How awesome is that! What a wonderful and memorable evening.

I ordered the calamari and pasta and the sauce wasn&#39;t really there at all. I ate a small portion and asked for it to be wrapped up to go. Went home and added more homemade tomato sauce, not bad. 

We also ordered the standard spaghetti and meatballs and it was excellent. Sauce was spot on and meat balls were as Italian as Mom&#39;s homemade ones. 

I&#39;ll be back again but will avoid anything seafood. Beer selection had some Italian brews and the rest was domestics. 

Pricey ($50) for two with a drink but that was fine for a white tablecloth environment."

When we arrived a tall man was anything but friendly. As soon as he saw us walking in, he was not welcoming and had a disapproval  reaction.  He told us he was going to get the hostess. When the hostess arrived she confirmed we were the people who had just called. She stepped away and came back after a while and said the manager wouldn&#39;t allow for us to be seated at the open table even though it was a common practice to sit 4 adults and a highchair at a table for four.

Small place, I think only 8 or 9 tables plus the bar and the patio, maybe there is an upstairs?. good service but food was really only ok. My spicy rigatoni was very good, but daughters Alfredo was thick and dry, more like a paste than a sauce. Wife was not a huge fan of her pasta either, some dish with peas, prosciutto and pasta. Side salad was pretty boring but not awful. Pasta soup was ok. Bread was warm but overcooked and tough (maybe microwaved to warm it up? - that results in tough dense bread).

The mostaccioli is amazing. It&#39;s supposed to be home made pasta and it has an amazing texture and served with a tomato cream sauce. Everything else has been so, so.

For starters, the hostess was not good. We had a reservation and when we try to check in she walks away and comes back and says &#34;yeah it&#39;s gunna be a while.&#34; Pretty shortly. Uhm what?

We stood at the bar while waiting to be seated and the woman working as bartender that night was great. She was very friendly and knowledgable and made sure we were happy with our drinks.

Another problem with the restaurant was that it was REALLY LOUD. I mean REALLY loud. And there isn&#39;t much space in the restaurant so we kept being bumped into by everyone. It was like watching a traffic jam. 

When we were seated the servers were very friendly and knowledgable as well. They always made sure to &#34;tend&#34; (idk what word to use) to us quickly. 

What I didnt like was that the water that came with the tasted like crappy cheap tap water. I mean I guess what&#39;s what you get with free stuff eh?

I got the non-alcoholic drink known as the &#34;Easy Living&#34; which was a combination of pineapple juice, orange juice, and cranberry juice. It was freaking amazing!! I also got the Eggplant Parmesan for dinner and it came a side of the BEST tomato florentine soup ever!! The bread was quite good and it was warm but not the MOST amazing bread I ever had at an Italian restaurant. The love oil that came on the side was really good and the table had a jar of Parmesan too.

Overall the servers are what made this was a 4 star review instead of a 3 star review."

I chose the calamari steaks over a bed of greens that tasted like tofu instead of seafood. I had to load it up with sauce and parmesan cheese to give it flavor. He chose the lasagna which he enjoyed.

Who do these people think they are? That&#39;s just plain robbery. The food was marginal I ridere Eggplant parmigiana , they make the usual Americanized version, which looks more like Eggplant lasagna! It&#39;s typical old world Italian restaurant that have no clue! And try to please the American palate, with the big layers a bunch of melted cheese and some pasta! The cannoli were pretty good. Dario, i appreciate your reply. I know I was harsh I. My review. And I apologize for that I guess the Campari really pissed me off! I have to your restaurant and I have always been very pleased! Sorry did not like the eggplant parmigiana not my style!

Location &amp; building: Like other restaurants in the area, it is not easy to park here. You may have to walk a few blocks to get here, but you should already know that. The building is on the corner, and is eclectic and inviting. When we first walked in, we wondered where the heck they&#39;d sit our huge party, only to be guided around the back and up some very narrow stairs to the upper level. Another bar and dining room! This would be perfect for planning an event.

Booze: They have it, and a good wine selection at decent prices. There are reviews that are upset that they didn&#39;t have it when they opened - don&#39;t hold it against them, it&#39;s there now. Move on.

Appetizers: We ordered a few appetizers including a few of the caprese selections and calamari. The boys loved the Salsiccia Giambotto, and I&#39;ll admit the flavor of the sauce was great.

Dinner: I ordered the Linguini Scampi Diavolo and I was pumped to try it. I LOVE spicy food, love seafood and love Italian. Perfect, right? NO. This was so loaded with red pepper that it was nearly intolerable to digest. Even my other spice-fans that ordered it couldn&#39;t stomach more than half the meal. I took it to add cream sauce as leftovers, but later that night my stomach turned so violently that I knew that was going down the drain. Disappointing. Being a fan of very spicy food, I can&#39;t even imagine what would happen if the normal consumer ordered this. So stay away from the spicy red pepper items. Otherwise - everything was great. All that being said, I&#39;d still return for another try."

Excellent home made pasta done to.perfection. Guest had chicken lamone from menu. Chicken was done perfect, not overdone, not under done. Very tender. Added a little red pepper flakes to spice it up. Waitress &#34;Tiffany&#34; was willing to adjust any order to our liking. Never hear of that anymore. Great Plainfield secret. If you like authentic Italian, home made pasta, this is a must. Have not had an upscale restaurant in Plainfield for more than 10 years. We will be back. A little.pricey, but don&#39;t forget, real home made pastas and sauces. Happy to pay the bill.

We tried Capri after hearing good reviews about the place. I thought the menu could have been a little bigger, but it had an OK variety. As is typical of Italian restaurants, the headlines and dish names are in Italian,  but the descriptions are in English.

Our food was exactly what we expected. Not bad, but not outstanding. My wife ordered Chicken Vesuvio, and the way Capri prepares it is with mushrooms and onions. For an &#34;Italian&#34; dish that was invented in Chicago, it sure gets a lot of variety in the area and this was the farthest off of the &#34;norm&#34; that I&#39;ve seen. Our chocolate lava cake dessert was beautifully presented, but sadly overcooked.

Our service was excellent. We were seated immediately on a Friday night without reservations, though I&#39;m sure this had a lot to do with the fact that the place has no liquor license yet. Our waitress was very pleasant, attentive, and made good suggestions.  The decor of the restaurant very much was reminiscent of the former Irish pubs that preceded this restaurant in the same location, save for the removal of the tap rail and the addition of white tablecloths, a replica of the Mona Lisa, and Ol&#39; Blue Eyes playing in the background. Seating is cumbersome, as it&#39;s split half upstairs and half downstairs with no restroom upstairs (that I know of...)

Overall, as Americanized Italian restaurants go, this hits right in that sweet spot of &#34;Exactly what you would expect, but unremarkable.&#34; - We&#39;ve all been in this restaurant dozens of times, just in different places with different names."

We had a 7pm reservation and when we went in, it was very crowded. There&#39;s not much room at the front so everyone was crammed in and bumping into each other. 7pm came and went, 7:15..7:20..7:30..finally, we were able to be seated. My main issue was the hostess. There is a younger girl who is always friendly and courteous. This Saturday they also had an older woman who could care less that she was at work. She was playing on her phone behind the podium and looked so bored. She could give us no update on our table the whole time and was not friendly to people entering or leaving the restaurant. I was VERY put off by her behavior."

Our server was Paulina, and she was / is fantastic! She was super friendly and very attentive to us.
We chose the Lasagna and Chicken Marsala. The portions are great. Actually, the lasagna was 3/4 of the size of the plate, so lucky for me I have left overs. :-)  The taste of the food was awesome. It definitely tastes homemade, compared to some places where you can tell it came in frozen off of a truck.

My waiter, Mike, spent 10 minutes to go over explanations of some dishes, his favorites, and the daily specials. Great service, wow. 

I ordered the Vodka Rigatoni. But from Mike&#39;s recommendation, I got it with sausage in it. (Same price with or without). HOLY MOLY!!!! I was almost falling out of my chair. The sausage was to die for, or to kill for... preferably.  :)

I also ordered a side of house-made meatballs. But the sausage and rigatoni was so good, I mainly focused on that. Also, rigatoni pasta is handmade. GREAT texture. 

I will DEFINITELY be back. Very satisfied customer here."

The issue is with every other server employed there.  At one point, there were 6 of them all standing at the end of the bar all playing on their phones.  I don&#39;t know about you, but I don&#39;t need an audience while I eat.  Then...  The &#34;manager&#34; says that it&#39;s time to light the candles on the tables.  NOBODY MOVES.  Finally, the bartender, who&#39;s the only one doing anything so far, goes and lights all the candles.  Also, I forgot to mention that the female (?) server with the long frizzy hair has not stopped eating since we walked in.  Bar fruit, chocolate, anything she can grab, all while licking her fingers between each course.

I ordered a gift card by phone for a birthday present and was told it would be mailed the next day. 5 days later after not receiving it I called and was assured that it was mailed out. Waited 3 more days and called again and was told that it was actually mailed out 3 days after I ordered it. Waited 2 more days and called them again and asked to talk to a manager this time. Manager said he would look into it and call me back. 3 days later no call back so I called again and talked to another manager. Told him that it was now 2 weeks and the person&#39;s birthday was 4 days ago, and now I just wanted a refund on my CC. He kept saying he would look into it and I told him three times I did not want him to look into it but I wanted a refund. In fact he kept cutting me off and I had to ask him to please let me finish my sentence! 3 days later I had not received the refund on my card so I filed a dispute with my credit card company. Then later that day I received the card!
Through this whole process no one apologized for their mistake, I was blown off by a manager, another manager would not even let me finish a sentence and did not follow my instructions to refund my card, and no one called to follow up. The customer service could not have been worse."

We frequent downtown Plainfield and wanted to try something different. We had a taste for pasta and this seemed perfect. 

The restaurant was very nicely decorated and had a good feel to it. Music was a little loud but bearable. 

We were  the only ones in the place but did not receive the attention you would have expected. We ordered the caprese to start, each of us had the minestrone. My wife ordered the tilapia with lemon sauce/artichokes/sun dried tomatoes. I ordered the linguine with clams and white sauce.

Appetizer and soup was good. No complaints at all on those.
The fish was good but fairly basic. Artichokes were canned. It was weird that the pasta came with marinara since the fish had a lemon sauce.

Linguine was ok. 100% not homemade pasta, definitely dried pasta, like the $1 box at the store. It was cooked very well though and not over/under done. Clams were plentiful and tasted normal. Very watery sauce though.

The bartender used the F word at least 5 times while he was reading a bad review of the restaurant! Not very professional, good thing the kids weren&#39;t with us.

Save the $75 and make pasta at home, it will taste the same. I will stick to the Wine and Cheese shop next door."

The food was easily a 5+. We had the Capri Calamari for an appetizer and I had the Italian Meatloaf special for my entree. The calamari was great and the Italian Meatloaf was came in a proportion that will allow me to eat if for lunch for the next 2 days. 

The service from the waitress was great, she was very knowledgeable and told us about the specials which we all ended up getting and they were great. The only weird service thing was the lack of a hostess at the front door and confusion about what table we were to sit at when we got there. But that was just a minor thing and the food and service from the waitress makes up for that easily.

The &#34;host&#34; was too busy sipping coffee to even say hi. It took her a minute to just acknowledge us, which was really rude. Maybe hiring a younger host who smiles and actually greets their guests, would help on the 1st impression!
We sat down and noticed the place was pretty small, but we were hopeful the food would outshine the experience thus far.  
Our waitress was nervous, not knowledgable or too interested in providing exceptional service. 
Day old bread was waiting on the table with a tomato creation, that was actually so bad, we asked for it to be removed. 
At this point-we should have left, but I did not want to be rude &amp; possibly cause a scene. 
We asked about their wine, a huge disappoint. Their selection is very limited. Unless you are buying the bottle. 
Their food is completely Americanized. For Plainfield, maybe this has proven acceptable. I will be making the drive to the city for true Italian food next time. 
If you do not mind the mediocre food, loud music where you are yelling at your guests at the same table, rude service, and don&#39;t ask questions-then eat here.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Ok... First off, as a real Italian, and by real I mean traditionally raised with all the included Italian bs, this place has potential. 

I ordered baked clams, which were not too good, and the gnocchi bolognese, which was PHENOMENAL. The complimentary bread was hard and almost not edible. 

First the clams... Very greasy! Had an odd aftertaste. Not worth the price at all. 

The gnocchi... Holy shit this was like crack. Very soft and melts in your mouth, just deelish. I got half way through and was stuffed but HAD to finish! The bolognese means it has meat in the sauce. Not my favorite but it was extremely good. 

The bread.... Ummmmmmmmmmm, yeah it sucked. 

All in all, I will definitely go back and try other items. Very reasonably priced and the gnocchi alone would keep me coming back. 
Give it a try and have an open mind. This is a nice Italian restaurant in PLAINFIELD, remember that. It&#39;s good for the area it&#39;s in. 

The waitstaff was excellent! Very friendly."

The chef is from the Capri in Burr Ridge, which puts him in a pretty good league.  EVERYTHING is made from scratch. We ordered the tortellini and the eggplant parm.  Food and service were great!   The manager/owner was present and made sure to spend time with all the tables and guests.    As a new restaurant I&#39;d offer just a few suggestions:   1) There is a decorative martini glass when you walk in filled with red liquid.  Looks nice, but a natural fly trap.   Not a good first impression.   Dump the water and fill with decorative rocks.   2) The menu is very traditional italian, so doesn&#39;t have a ton of healthier/lighter choices.   I would suggest adding some more salads or a few healthier options in addition to all the great rich italian cuisine.

They now have their liquor license!

Bruschetta was lack luster.  Bread is good, but simply drizzling tomatoes in olive oil &amp; a dash of parm leaves much to be desired.  This could be easily fixed with a little balsamic, basil, and/or oregano.

Caesar Salad was fantastic.  M wife ordered a house salad with balsamic dressing that was boring.

For dinner I had rigatoni arrabiata with prosciutto that was very good.  The pasta was great, the spice was just right.  Could have used a little more prosciutto in my opinion, but that wasn&#39;t enough to make it an issue.

My wife had Chicken Marsala, which was ok, but didn&#39;t wow either of us.

Reasonably priced, in a good location, just needs to grow into what it has the potential to be.  Overall, this was a good first experience with a new place downtown Plainfield.  We will be back to explore the menu a little further!"

Capri Sogno is within walking distance of my house. Priceless. I will be here every week. 

Hubby and I walked to Capri and were seated right away at 6 on Friday for dinner. We sat upstairs in the dining room. Our server was their bartender. I wish I could remember her name because she was excellent!!! We ordered 2 appetizers, their bruschetta and calamari that was breaded and saut√©ed in olive oil, lemon and seasonings. Both were delicious.

I ordered lasagna and hubby ordered tortellini with peas, mushrooms and pancetta with Alfredo sauce. He also opted to add Italian sausage. The lasagna was solid. I would definitely order it again. The tortellini was excellent. Their Alfredo sauce is light and creamy and in my opinion one of the best I&#39;ve ever tasted.

Worst ever they dumped a meat sauce over the top that was so greasy it made me sick. No complaints in the past , but they really dropped the ball . It should have never been served even after adding a little green leaf on top. It was the worst ever after a $ 60. Bill. From now on I will send back anything I question. I was nice because it was my birthday dinner."

  Mike was our waiter . He was awesome and very knowledgeable about the menu and the specials.
    For drinks , I had Merlot and my wife had Sangrias. The Sangrias were very good.  For the appetizer we had stuffed mushrooms. They were very tasty. The only thing wrong was that the plate only had 3 mushrooms and not 4!

  I had the stuffed chicken special on a bed of Risotto and my wife has a pasta special. Sorry I don&#39;t have more details on the meals but their presentation was fine. The food was hot and a very good quantity.

For dessert we had Limoncello cake and a Chocolate Lava cake. I liked the Limoncello cake the best of the two.

   We would both recommend dining here and plan on returning soon!"

Also butter was served In a little pad that needed to be opened similar to what you would see in a diner.  Totally did not go with the ambience and atmosphere that this restaurant is trying to convey.  Also for our table of 6 we got 5 pieces of bread and had to request more.

I had her key lime pie martini, which was out of this world good. My husband and I generally prefer to share several items, so we shared the Calamari alla Capri (delicious and cooked *perfectly,* which tends to be tough to find!), ceasar salad (fantastic homemade dressing, though be prepared for garlic!), and Lasagna di Carne (best I&#39;ve ever had, including my own- the pasta had to have been fresh).

I went to dinner with 3 of my girlfriends this past Sat. We had made reservations at 3 pm and they were very busy but somehow managed to squeeze us in. Upon arrival, we were informed the table behind us was lingering a lot longer than anticipated. 

Most people would be worried that would turn in to a longer wait, which we were. Sure enough they opened up the private room for us upstairs despite it only being a party of 4 to make sure we were taken care of as promised when we made the reservation. 

The manager Ed was very friendly and recommended numerous dishes for us to try out. Our server, Tiffany, was incredibly attentive, friendly, and overall more than what anyone could ask for during their dining experience. 

I don&#39;t even need to talk about the food because there are not words to describe how great the vodka sauce is there. The gnocchi was also incredible  and if the stuffed calamari is a special when you go, I highly recommend it.

My wife tried their Sunday plate, which was really, really good.  Like we took it home and had it for lunch and dinner the next day, it was so good.

I had the Tortellini Paesano, which was thankfully smaller than the Sunday plate - I only got to take some home for lunch.

The french bread was fresh, the salad and soup were good, and the tomato and mozzarella appetizer (which is part of the reason why we couldn&#39;t finish dinner, okay what I couldn&#39;t finish dinner) were pretty darn good.  

I like authentic Italian, the problem is that it is hard to find.  It was nice to find this place - we&#39;ll be back.

One quirk - we were there and the tables were all full (reservations are suggested by me if you want a seat!) so we sat at the bar.  Since we had some idea of what we wanted, we ordered wine at the bar, and then had to cash out that ticket.  Most places would just jump it to the table.  Odd, but who cares for food this good."

Right when we walked in- it truly smelled like the elephant exhibit at the zoo. Talk about taking your appetite away. 

So we are making our food at the self service bar of food and all the food is mixed together due to everyone just grabbing it. I opted for the ribeye and ny strip as my meat. The ribeye was sooooo stringy it was just in globs of stringy disaster. 

Then as we go up to get in line to get our food cooked several of the guys had exposed beards or hair standing over cooking all the food - all I could think was I really hope there isn&#39;t going to be hair in my food.

So they have their system where they match your sauce to the dish and of course they messed up a couple of peoples dishes and sauces and didn&#39;t offer the girl anything due to messing up her dish- just a &#34;I&#39;m sure it will be fine seemed like a similar sauce to yours&#34; 

We then got our food and my boyfriend specifically didn&#39;t put any &#34;greens&#34; in his dish but ended up with a few broccolis, peapods and even a couple edamames. The system they have is not a good one and the service was not good.

i used to frequent mongolian bbq back when they were in lakeview and cared about what they were doing. it was awesome.

this place is horrible.

rice on the table was basically raw.

my friend has shellfish allergies so after she tells the &#39;cook&#39;  about it he goes ahead and  throws her food on the grill with everyone else&#39;s.
we call him back and tell him and he says &#39;oh sorry, here&#39;s a bowl, just fill it back up.&#39;
she does.
she comes back and what does he do?
puts her food right back on the grill with everyone else&#39;s.

i would understand if the place was really busy and food orders were flying in left and right but it wasn&#39;t. 
it was so empty the cook had the time to sit there flipping dirty food bowls splattering sauce and noodles all over the counter and people waiting for their food.

id avoid this place at all costs, especially if you have allergies because they just don&#39;t care.
save your money."

But I wouldn&#39;t make this voyage again (even if Cookie Dough Creations is walking distance from here).

Each of us ordered the make-your-own stir fry bowl for about $14.50 each.  Unlike at Flat Top (next most comparable restaurant that offers custom stir fry like this), the meat/veggie/toppings station does not have the same items on each side of the buffet set up, so you&#39;ll either have to a) reach across to the tongs on the other side of the bar and likely inadvertently smear your cheek against the clear &#34;hood&#34; over the food which displays what each of the items are, or b) get out of line on your side and walk over to the other side of the buffet bar to wait over there... which I did and led to my food being prepared 10 minutes after my husband&#39;s.  Yes, the line does move pretty slowly during prime time dinner hour.

Also unlike at Flat Top, you need to stand and wait for your stir fry to be prepared before taking your dish back to your table vs. leaving the bowl at the cook station with an ID number that a waiter later picks up and delivers to your table.  It was a madhouse at the cook station, and I wondered how often orders get mixed up or served to the wrong person.  I didn&#39;t have to wonder if it would happen to me though bc it did!  For my sauces, I chose teriyaki and Mongolian BBQ sauce, which were both brown/tan, but when I was served my plate, it had this red pepper flake/red tomato sauce over half the meat and veggies.  Ugh. 

I will give them this: toppings are plentiful.  Meats include ribeye (highlight), New York strip chunks, chicken, scallops, tofu, etc.  Plenty of veggies include edamame, mushrooms, broccoli, peppers, and onions, and there&#39;s a bowl of eggs to pick from right before the sauce and spices station.  Be prepared to slip and slide a little down the buffet line bc there were a lot of toppings accidentally dropped on the floor.  With your stir fry, you can choose a side of white rice, noodles, lettuce wraps, or fried rice.

The shocker of the evening is that bd&#39;s is on OpenTable!  I also missed my chance for a free fried Oreo by checking in via Yelp.  Dang!"

I had a craving for some hibachi last weekend, but the hubs and I really didn&#39;t want to spend a whole lot of money on this casual date (otherwise we would have gone to Kiku). It&#39;s been a few years since I&#39;ve been to Mongolian, so we decided to pay them a visit. 

At 6:30 pm on a Saturday night we had to wait about 20-25 minutes for a table. We sat in the bar area to wait and it was like 90 degrees in there. I ordered a root beer ($2.60) and despite it being served with ice, it was still warm. My husband ordered a beer for $6. They actually had some really great local beer on tap. The cubs were playing so we enjoyed watching that while we waited.

The hostess finally called our name and we were sat in the back room which we were grateful for because it was much cooler and a lot more quiet. They have a TV screen back there as well, so my husband was happy to finish watching the game.

If you&#39;ve never been to Mongo before, just know the menu explains all your options and also offers different appetizers, desserts, etc. We decided to start with the potstickers and then headed up to make our bowls. I always do my own concoction of meats, veggies, noodles, and sauces, but they offer recipe cards if you&#39;re looking for something specific. 

Here are some tips for moving through the line:

* Although noodles are first in the line, I recommend putting them on top. That way you can fit more in your bowl and items aren&#39;t falling all over the place

* It may seem confusing and you may be concered the grillers will lose your bowl and matching sauce, but they&#39;re like a well oiled machine! They know exactly what they&#39;re doing.

* Stay in order while in line! And keep moving down to allow more folks to fit around the grill.

I pretty much make the same thing every time I&#39;m here and I love it. I got a side of tortillas and my husband opted for white rice. Everything tasted delicious, but I must warn you - if you have  a sensitive stomach, you might want to ask the grillers to not use so much oil on the grill.

Overall, BD&#39;s is a bit chaotic, but a fun experience. Food is great and service is good, but it will not be a relaxing and quiet dinner, so know what you&#39;re getting yourself into. I also suggest making a reservation because they get really busy on the weekends."

The concept of this place is great. It maximizes volume and efficiency. That clearly makes it pleasant for both staff and patrons. 

However, I would be more impressed if they had actual Mongolians making my food.

With all of that being said, the buffet itself is a freaking mess.

We agreed that since we were heading here at 5:30 p.m., we didn&#39;t need a reservation.  But the restaurant was full less than an hour later on a Friday.  

When we arrived, the hostess asked us if we had a reservation.  I thought she was joking, because there were several empty tables.  She said, &#34;hmm okay let me check if I have anything.&#34;  We waited another few minutes only to be seated at the empty table right behind the hostess stand.  

Um, maybe make a reservation...they seem to be more efficient if you do.  BD&#39;s is a super casual chain, so we didn&#39;t think it was necessary...

The concept is simple, and the same, at both the Bolingbrook and Naperville locations.  You can order 1 bowl, or unlimited bowls, depending on how hungry you are.  The salad bar is basic and not worth it.  The soups are terrible.  Customizing your stir fry experience IS worth it, and that&#39;s what you&#39;re there for!  You select from a variety of noodles and rice, vegetables, and meats, and you can pile as much or as little as you want into your bowl.  

The guys cooking the food are pros.  I don&#39;t know how they kept track of orders on a Friday night.  The restaurant was packed, and although there was a wait for food, those guys were hauling ass!  The waitstaff isn&#39;t as great though.  Our waitress disappeared a few times and was later replaced.  A police officer showed up and was talking to our waitress in the middle of the restaurant.  Yeah...that was strange.  Maybe take your personal business in the office?

I love the make-your-own stir fry.  I piled my bowl with tons of veggies (sugar snap peas, water chestnuts, cilantro, broccoli, mini corn cobs, bean sprouts), lots of meat (New York strip and chicken) and topped it with a garlic chili sauce marked &#34;hot,&#34; but it wasn&#39;t all that spicy.

There&#39;s also something called an &#34;allergy zone,&#34; most likely for those who have shellfish or gluten allergies.  I&#39;m not sure exactly how it works, but it&#39;s there.

The food bins were very messy at this location.  There was a lot of spillage of one ingredient into another bin.  Everything is raw in the bins and gets cooked, so there&#39;s less need to worry about contamination than at typical buffets."

The idea is really cool, but if your super picky( like you only want meat and noodles) then it&#39;s kinda pricey. But if you like to load up your bowl lien myself you will like it.
I will say if you have allergies this may not be the greatest place for you. I&#39;m sure they have a certain procedure but there flat top grill cooks literally everything on it. They do scrape the area clean before they put someone else&#39;s food in the same area. I really enjoyed my meal. The bowls look really small put after it is cooked and plates it is plenty of food, and I can never finish my plate.
The beer prices were not the greatest but this isn&#39;t really the place you go to for drink specials so that was okay.
Overall I enjoyed my experience, my server was good, and my food was delicious. The only thing I will say is that the bar was kinda dusty and the grill area was pretty dirty, but it&#39;s a resultant and I understand that. The bathrooms were clean and I do appreciate that."

Salad bar isn&#39;t much better. Grill area is also really nasty. Food was ALL over the floor, dirty,dirty,dirty.

So much so that even after two horrible experiences I made my husband attempt a third.  But this past Spring was the last time we visited and were sorely disappointed...again.  When this location opened, I remember top notch service, clean and full product selection, and most of all fresh choices.  The last three times we went to make our own stir fry, several of the meat choices were turning grey, which can&#39;t be healthy.  Granted we always chose this restaurant as a late lunch, early dinner kind of place so visited around 4 pm, I realize it was an off time.  But that didn&#39;t mean I wanted to eat off steak!  
But it wasn&#39;t just the red meat.  The vegetables were poorly cut, so that I had ain&#39;t her huge green peppers, or no green peppers.  Some of the sauces had a film so thick on the top I couldn&#39;t get the spoon to stir, let alone lift!  And the calamari was a giant glob of frozen tentacles.  And I&#39;m describing three separate visits that all were like this!
When we dined there last time, I was at my wits end trying to find our server for a refill.  I never did find her, and ended up asking the hostess for the new drink...and the check.

My husband asked for tortillas and they were cold and I think they served them straight from the package. There are so many yummy restaurants, I will not be returning!"

Bd&#39;s specializes in, you guessed it, Mongolian BBQ! They do have appetizers, drinks, and desserts, but it&#39;s mainly all about the bowl.

They have separate lunch and dinner menus. Lunch is cheaper and has the same things.

They give you a relatively small bowl to stack up as much meat and vegetables as you can. They have a variety of sauces and spices, too.

We all decided to do one bowl with the unlimited soup and salad combo. I had chicken, two eggs, and a ton of different vegetables. I didn&#39;t have any sauce but I added some cracked black pepper with my meal. You can also request white rice, brown rice, tortillas, or lettuce wraps with your bowl. I went with the latter!

For the soup/salad, they have an iceberg/romaine combo along with spinach for the bases. They have your typical salad toppings with a few different dressings too. As for the soups of the day, they featured a tomato parmesan and a garden leek soup. I had the garden leek and it was good; not great, just good.

Back to the bowl... it was very good. Lots of flavor even without a sauce! I put lots of my bowl (which turned into a plate once cooked) into lettuce wraps. Very good!

My only complaint is some of my friend&#39;s noodles ended up on my plate. It wasn&#39;t a huge issue but if someone had an allergy or didn&#39;t want something, that could be a problem.

Overall, I was extremely satisfied with Bd&#39;s and I&#39;m looking forward to returning. Service was good as well. Restaurant wasn&#39;t crowded but it wasn&#39;t empty, either.

If you&#39;re in Naperville and looking for something relatively healthy, head here!"

The eight of us decided to try the BD Mongolian grill across the street where the manager explained this company had bought out Flat Top.   The eight of us agreed that we were very disappointed in the flavor of our meals and the fact you don&#39;t have the Roti bread which was our favorite.   The tortillas were horrible, I&#39;ve feel better from the grocery store.   In our opinion you closed the wrong restaurant and should&#39;ve left Flat Top open.

I dunno why, but I really suck at this...ALWAYS!  Parking is annoying here which is weird because it&#39;s in a gigantic suburb! The restaurant itself was also freezing where I kept my winter jacket on the whole time which was annoying.

The waitress recommended potstickers as appetizers.  Being asian, I&#39;m  always skeptical about ordering these at non asian restaurants, and I was right to be here.  Even in the picture it didn&#39;t look appetizing...but she said it was there #1 seller and everyone loves them.  They came out looking like they came right out of the bag and you could see the freezer burns.  On top of that they were still a little frozen and tastes god awful!

We get unlimited soup and salad along with our unlimited bowls, but all the soups looked gross and the salad bar didn&#39;t look fresh...so we just stuck to noodle bar.  I tried 3xs to make a bowl and didn&#39;t like any of them...that is my own fault.  

I do love the concept though, but I just can never be happy here!  I also find it annoying that you have to  flag down your  waitress everytime you want to make another bowl.  And everytime you make a bowl the guys who cook the food say stuff like &#34;this is your second bowl right?&#34; Why are you counting??? It&#39;s unlimited bowls! stop judging me!

We also got the deep fried oreos for dessert for free for checking in on yelp  Probably the best part of the meal!"

Even though I live in Chicago, I&#39;ll still make the trek to Naperville now that they are the last man standing.

The waiter brought us bowls and we went to make our dishes.  The bowl is pretty small, so it&#39;s hard to put all the stuff you want in it and try to juggle some noodles on top.  They and to be free and don&#39;t want to stay inside the bowl.  It&#39;s much easier if you forgo the noodles.  The waiter will provide a side of white rice, brown rice, or tortillas with each bowl.

The dish I made turned out alright, but definitely not worth the $12.99.  Maybe I should have just eaten a bowl of scallops.  As for the sauces, they provide a good variety of them.  I went with the Chili Garlic Sauce, Peanut Sauce and Shiitake Mushroom.  I guess you&#39;re supposed to put the sauce in a separate small bowl, but I didn&#39;t know that until I went to the cooks to hand over my creation.  All they do is stir fry the stuff in the bowl together on a large heated surface.  I like Flat Top better because you have other options like adding soup or making a lettuce wrap.  And I just remember the overall taste and experience being better than here.

One Bowl of Stir Fry-$12.99
Unlimited Bowls of Stir Fry-$14.99

If you read some of the older reviews and saw the $1 Miller Lite pint, that is NO more.  No dollar pints here  (they are $3), but there is a bar nearby that was serving $1 drafts.

This restaurant is located in downtown Naperville near Flat Top grill.  There&#39;s a free parking deck close by if street parking isn&#39;t available."

Im used to going to the Bolingbrook location, and let me tell you they do not skimp out on anything! Here it seemed they skimp you out on anything they give to you besides the bowl portion that you control the amount of. I ordered lettuce wraps and they give you the tiniest leaves ever. I ordered a second helping thinking I got the end of a head of lettuce, and nope same thing small itsy bitsy leaves of lettuce again. I ordered brown rice and they barely filled the bowl. Besides the portions they also do not give you the options they do at the Bolingbrook location. Sure, theres an egg scare going on so I understand there being no control on having egg with your dish, but at least at the Bolingbrook location they still give you the option to have egg in your dish you just have to ask. This location abandoned the egg all together. Claiming that it was too costly...whatever. The biggest gripe I had though is they did not have any curry powder! I asked and they said they ran out of curry weeks ago and forgot to order it. Wow, coming here was a big let down because the bowl I make egg and curry made my dish. I had to settle for a bland dish, and wacky small portions that are too small for even a child. Two stars for letting me down BDs, twas a sad night for dinner.."

My visit was on Saturday Feb.7, around 7:30 PM. I suppose it was a busy night for the place. We were part of a rather large birthday party. We were seated in the front section of the restaurant right next to the bar. The space was definitely overcrowded with our party and other patrons. They could have done away with at least 4 or 5 tables in the room. I felt like I was crammed into a clown car. Seriously. This over crowded dining area only had 1 server manning the floor. Unacceptable. I mean, I can read the menu. I can grasp the concept of walking to the sections and grabbing my own materials to make my on creations, I don&#39;t like that I had to ask for a water refill. I had to ask for tortillas, and what is up with tortillas(South American) at an &#34;Asian&#34; inspired restaurant? I had to ask if I could have ice with my lemonade. The server was doing her absolute best, she was a sweetheart. But management could have sent another person to help her on the floor. The concept and idea of the restaurant is very cool. Loved the giant grill and watching the cooks work their magic on the foods. Ingredients were fresh. Food tasted fine. They have these little cards that tell you what you can mix in there.

Partly because I love the food and atmosphere, and party because they send me a coupon for a free meal every year on my special day. When I got stationed in North Carolina for four years, I was extremely upset because they had nothing like Bd&#39;s. So every time I came home, I made sure I ate here!

What I love most about this place is that it remains consistent. I have been going here for over ten years now and nothing has changed. They understand that they have good thing going and that there is no need to change the menu, the atmosphere, or the way in which they cook the food. Smart!

For those of you who have never been here, Bd&#39;s Mongolian Grill is pretty much like stir fry. You can order either one bowl or unlimited bowls and with it you get to eat from their soup and salad bar as well as their stir fry bar. 

The stir fry bar is great! You have so many different selections of meat, vegetables, noodles, sauces, and seasoning. You make everything yourself and then you bring it to this giant grill where cute guys cook it up for you. The whole process takes maybe 5 to 8 minutes on a good day, but if it&#39;s packed...expect to be there for awhile. It can take at least 15 minutes to get through the line, but they do a good job of keeping everyone moving for the most part.

Aside from their bowl options, they have other entrees, appetizers and desserts on their menu to choose from. I usually stick with the bowls because I can make it how I want it. 

Another great thing about this is that it makes eating out healthy if you do it the right way! The staff are awesome about helping people put together meals if they are on a special type of diet. If you&#39;re on the paleo diet, you can choose from a variety of meats and vegetables. If you only eat gluten free, they have little signs on everything to let you know what doesn&#39;t have gluten. 

Of course if you don&#39;t care about eating healthy...order the deep fried oreos! They are heavenly.

Overall, Mongolian is a great place! The prices are very reasonable, the food is delicious, I&#39;ve never had a problem with the service, and the atmosphere is just really fun."

He gets a 2 star.  It seemed like a mess to me but he had it all together.  (though he did get a few dishes mixed up)  The server on the other hand was a bit MIA but pleasant.

The food was not good.  I prepared a vegetarian meal, not because i don&#39;t do meat but I just chose not to today, and I found several pieces from others dishes.  I mean I know stuff gets mixed up but I felt like it was more than one stray beef chunk.  Several pieces were black and clearly burnt to a crisp.  The whole dish didn&#39;t even taste like I got sauce (which I actually threw in 2 sauce dishes of peanut/pad thai sauce with peanuts....just saying).  Several of the other people at my table had the same complaints.  I was still hungry so a tried the salad bar which was underwhelming but at least I didn&#39;t leave hungry.

The salad bar and meat/veggie bar looked like 250 people had just gone through.  Food was in-between containers, the floor had food on it, and the bars were just unkept in general.  The restaurant was not busy.  The shrimp looked mushy and many still had the veins.  I wouldn&#39;t eat it.  The ribeye was just a mess.  The large table next to us had not been cleared from the previous customer and stayed that way for 30 minutes after we arrived.  The gentlemen cooking the food had no personality and didn&#39;t interact with customers. Behind the food bar, a tile was broken on the floor which is a potential tripping hazard.

Seriously, hands down the worse I&#39;ve ever tasted. They are cheaply priced, but still not worth it. My mom got a frozen mango margarita and when it came it wasn&#39;t even freshly blended. It was like it had been blended in bulk an hour ago then put in the fridge. It was just cold liquid, not frozen. And it tasted terrible. It was WAY too sweet and it didn&#39;t taste like tequila was even in it. I got a strawberry margarita on the rocks, and it was worse. It was SO syrupy and sweet, and tasted nothing like strawberry. We sent it back immediately and I ordered a coke. 
So those are the drinks, now the second worse thing: the service. We waited 10 minutes after being seated at our table before a waiter came for our drink order. She was nice, but so slow. It look another 10-15 to get our drinks and about 30 minutes or more to get the appetizer we ordered. The appetizer was actually pretty good, which is good news. 
As for the bowls, they do have a good selection of meat, veggies and sauces, but it is SO dirty! So much stuff on the floor and sauces dripping into other sauces. If you have allergies or specific diet I would never go here because who the hell knows what you are actually scooping into your sauce bowl when you put in teriyaki sauce. My bowl was okay. Nothing special. Service continued to be slow. The best part of the night was when I manager (maybe) came around and asked how everything was and we told him about the terrible drinks. He pretty much agreed that they&#39;re terrible and he was sorry. He chatted with us for a bit which was nice. He saved me from giving a 1 star rating! Over all... Don&#39;t waste your time or money.

I gave this place a shot because I thought hey, maybe it might be better. Boy, was I wrong!!! The drinks are really bland. The cocktails are pure syrup. The food is even more bland. There weren&#39;t a lot of choices for sauces and I couldn&#39;t try any of the them. I had no idea how they tasted so it was a hit or miss. Usually I&#39;m used to putting rice or noodles as my base and at this place you got rice separately. Only one cup of rice per table....I guess there&#39;s a shortage that no one knows about. They didn&#39;t offer any cheese or roti bread. The vegetables were very limited as well. There was no spinach or cabbage only mushrooms, tomatoes and a few other. overall the service, food, beverages and atmosphere were bland. No other word to describe it. I would not come back to this place."

My husband and I usually go to the Bolingbrook location and when we moved to Naperville, we were excited there was a Bd&#39;s near our apartment! Sad though that this location wasn&#39;t as good as our normal Bolingbrook. We went on a Sunday and it honestly wasn&#39;t that busy. Our waitress was nice... But we saw her like a handful of times and was always waiting for her to come back. We also had to ask for water refills. I didn&#39;t understand that at all. Usually the waitress/waiter is supposed to offer refills and what not, but she never did. We always had to ask. Anyways the monogolian here was just okay. They only had two cookers so I thought this is going to be quick! My husband got his dish and then I got mine. Mine was so burnt! It was not flavorful at all and it was disgusting. So thankfully I was able to make another bowl(free of charge), but by the time my bowl was finished cooking my husband was done eating his!:( He was basically just watching me eat. We didn&#39;t enjoy our date night dinner which was disappointing. :/ So we won&#39;t be back to this location. This location needs to stepping up to do."

I love Mongolian BBQ but my co- worked had never had it. The menus offer recipes to help you get creative or for the new comer.

Super friendly and nice and customer focused.  This is the way customers should be treated.  

The food was great (except bring back actual blue cheese on your salad bar!)....but I am loving the new choices of meat including siracha chicken!  Great way to keep up with the times!  I now live on the west coast and miss it out there - always happy to visit BD&#39;s when I come home to visit."
bds-mongolian-grill-naperville,Eli H.,8q7xPmUI05LI-xQN8DLOww,"Aurora, IL",1,1,1,161,8,QZcgv_t1jO440La4V_ISdg,2.0,2012-07-13,"It&#39;s a little sad how the once almost exotic novelty of create your own stir fry has since been homogenized into a filthy restaurant with poor service and an attitude of &#34;Eh, we&#39;ll just cook whatever.&#34; Perhaps it&#39;s the rose colored glasses of nostalgia, but when BD&#39;s Mongolian Grill first opened, it really felt special. Your server would come by, explain the whole process, offer suggestions, keep your beverages constantly topped off, and just generally serve as your tour guide through what used to be a really cool experience that seemed to blend almost-teppanyaki style cooking with an all you can eat buffet. The buffet area was meticulously clean and orderly, and the guys cooking your food engaged the people waiting, making you excited to take another trip up.

But, oh, how the mighty have fallen.

Your typical Mongolian Grill trip these days involves standing around waiting for a table as the wait staff focuses more on checking their text messages than they do cleaning tables and seating people. From there, you sit down, some greasy and/or sticky menu cards are tossed your way, and your drink orders are taken. Keep your fingers crossed they have clean glasses, as the last time we went we were served with an apology and mason jars.

From there, you&#39;re given a bowl to fill up, and are told to have at it. As mentioned before, beyond a couple paintings on the wall and a few sauce selections, they&#39;ve all but entirely ditched the Asian theme. Meatballs, sausage slices, and all sorts of other strange selections have joined the old standards, although it&#39;s all so poorly curated that no matter what meat you select chances are you&#39;re getting a little bit of at least a few others. The vegetables are even worse, and the saucing station (along with the floor below it) looked like it hadn&#39;t been wiped down this decade.

Once you make it to the grill area, it&#39;s not much of a surprise that it&#39;s even more repulsive. I&#39;m sure the grill itself is fine since I can&#39;t imagine any bacteria on this planet that can survive the heat of the massive cast iron cook top, but I&#39;m not sure the same can be said for the metal utensils they use to stir everyone&#39;s food as well as the tile floor surrounding the grill- Both of which seem to share a thick layer of black greasy sludge.

From there, interactivity is limited to continually being told to move to the left, as you stand there inadvertently judging the culinary combinations of others, and second guessing your own. Oh, also, a new monstrosity we discovered this trip is the fact that human ingenuity has resulted in people double-dipping into the salad bar to add cheese to their creations. Apparently that&#39;s a thing now, and useful if you really want to shatter your previous daily caloric intake records.

The food itself is decent, as I&#39;m not really sure it&#39;s possible to mess up a mixture of meat, vegetables, and a random sauce. Make sure you pay attention to their beer specials too, as with soft drinks priced at nearly $3, you might as well flip out the extra 50¬¢ and get a tall glass of beer.

I suppose the novelty of BD&#39;s Mongolian Grill still makes it worth vaguely checking out, although I&#39;m not sure why you&#39;d come here anymore unless the wait at Flat Top Grill (Which is quite literally across the street.) is too long. If you get squeamish about dirty restaurants, stay far, far away from this one."

I think they forgot but didn&#39;t want to admit it. Already starving, we waited another 45 minutes in line. The grillers were vulgar and rude and treated customers like cattle. The bowls are smaller than they used to be and you pay more - $16 I believe for one bowl. I ordered a drink after I got my food and the waitress forgot about it. This place used to be awesome and reasonably priced, but has gone completely downhill. 

I went to Flattop Grill recently and the experience was the exact opposite. Clean, professional staff, great food, healthy portions, more options (especially for veggies), and excellent value. As a bonus, the second bowl at Flattop is only $4 so you can get a cheap meal to go. Don&#39;t waste your time on Mongolian - it ain&#39;t what it used to be."

Their mango cocktail was excellent and don&#39;t get me started it with the fried Oreo cookie! Absolutely amazing! I would definitely go back.

Our server seemed..... confused. It took forever for her to bring anything we asked for. It was just my husband and I. All we ordered were drinks and the unlimited bowls, and asked for water.  Each item seemed to take longer than the one before to reach us. We finally gave up on the water. She never offered the rice or tortillas to us. We had to ask after seeing them on other people&#39;s tables. We had not been to a Mongolian bbq in ages, and I remembered that at Flat Top the rice was up by the buffet. So finally after asking for it, she brought it to us so late that we were done eating. 

The food was good. Everything seemed fresh. The grill guys were nice. I brought my bowl back up because my steak was too rare and they were very nice about it. 

We only went here because my husband had gotten a free entree coupon. I don&#39;t think I would go back unless we got another one. I definitely like Flat Top better."

I&#39;m giving 2 stars not because the food was terrible, it really wasn&#39;t (mostly because I created my own food), but the experience was lacking. Service was SLOW, with not a whole lot of people in the restaurant which made it even more frustrating.

Over the last couple years the food quality and service have really gone down. The cleanliness of the buffet area has also really gone down hill too. 

On my last visit, there was a weird smell of rancid meat wafting from the buffet to our table. I had to go sit outside while the others paid for their meals. There are many better options in downtown Naperville, so I will not be returning here. 

Fried Oreos are still amazing, but won&#39;t be returning for just those."

Had a late lunch on Saturday for our family of 4.  We arrived around 2:30pm and it seemed like we caught the tail end of the lunch crowd.  We left around 4 and it was busy by then.  We both had unlimited bowls/soup/salad bar, and the kids had one bowl each.  Luckily though, it was quiet throughout the restaurant for most of our visit and we didn&#39;t have to wait long for our food...so, a tip - go when it&#39;s not as crowded!

I&#39;m still on their email list, so I received a recent email that they&#39;d revamped the menu selections.  All our faves were still there (shrimp, sirloin, NY strip, scallops) along with a few new ones, namely sausage and meatballs.  My husband and I stuck to our old faves, but the sausage and meatballs were a hit with the kids.  Good variety of vegetable and everything seemed fresh; though, I did get a few random pieces of veggies that I didn&#39;t put in my bowl (not sure if that was from the hibachi or the fill-up station), and the sauces were all good too.  Along with your meat/veggies, you get a choice of white rice, brown rice, tortillas and fried rice.  We shared white and brown rice, and got tortillas as well.  We went up a couple times each and also tried the salad bar.  Very happy with our food.

I have to give a shout-out to the staff.  The guys at the hibachi were great...quick with the food, friendly, and entertaining.  Kids loved watching them cook (and eating the stir-fry too!).

But a special mention to our server and the manager.  While waiting for our food to cook during our first-round up, our daughter was sitting back at the table for us (in clear line of our vision...we were seated right next to the grill) and she knocked over one of our drinks.  She rushed over to us at the grill to tell us, and our server and the manager noticed too.  Complete mess all over the table and the floor, but they got it cleaned up quickly, while reassuring our (crying) daughter that it was ok.  And after that, they made sure to stop by and check on us frequently as well as clear the table, give us new bowls, and top off our drinks.  Big ups to them.

We ended with dessert and while I wanted to try the fried Oreos, we went with the mini-cupcakes.  Good stuff, and another good experience at BD Mongolian."

It&#39;s very casual and a great stop for lunch to avoid all the dinner time crowds. They have daily drink specials too, which is nice if you are looking for some cheap drinks. It&#39;s a create your own stir-fry restaurant, so you grab a bowl from your server and head up to concoct your dish.

I always make one bowl of stir-fry with some chicken, beef and vegetables. The veggie and meat selection is always fresh and diverse. There are meat options such as chicken, sausage, beef tenderloin, sirloin, duck, shrimp, calamari, etc. Veggies are great too- I love that they have waterchesnuts here! They give the stir-fry a nice crunch. One bowl (full to the top, mind you) is always more than enough to satisfy me- although my boyfriend really likes the AYCE option. 

The desserts always look tempting, but by the time I&#39;m finished, there&#39;s no room. They have massive desserts that are really good for sharing. This is a great place for a group of friends to go for a celebration, or just a night out. 

The service is sometimes spotty, but overall, the place has a good vibe going on."

No thanks. Not to mention the fact that they should just give you bigger bowls for the veggies. I ended up with no food because I didn&#39;t realize I had to make the bowl literally overflow in order to get a respectable meal.

As if this place wasn&#39;t bad enough, i inadvertently got something extremely spicy in my dish. I don&#39;t like spicy things at all and I stuck to the mild sauces and spices but my mouth was on fire after one particular bite. 

And there&#39;s a large sign that says &#34;Vegetarian? Please inform our grillers&#34;. So I did and in response the griller rolled his eyes at me and haphazardly scraped the grill off a little bit. Thanks, that&#39;s every vegetarian&#39;s dream."

I&#39;d been there once before and what I like about it is that you totally control what goes in your bowl. So, it&#39;s a good choice for those who prefer not to eat meat or are watching carbs.  (However, bear in mind that EVERYONE&#39;s food gets cooked on the same grill.)

I was able to whip an incredibly hot and firey seafood stirfy and leave out the rice, for example. The bf was free to create his usual Mongolian beef.

And for those of you who are not culinary whizzes, they&#39;ve got recipe cards that give you a hint about how to combine foods in the right proportions so that your dish will  turn out tasty.

The only criticism that I would make is that the first time when I went on a Wednesday nite, the food seemed fine. However when I went on a Saturday afternoon, I thought there was a lot of carbonized bits in my food. I think they should have scraped the grill surface a bit more stringently that day.

Pros: You control the bowl.
Cons: You gotta stand in line and wait for your food to cook."

Yummy. If you are a big eater--come here. If you are a big meat or even just a vege person-come here! The restaurant is BIG. You can smell the wonderful spices from outside. Right in the middle of downtown Naperville, this is the perfect spot to spend 12 bucks for non-stop food.

I went tonight, a Tuesday night, and it was pretty full. The service is excellent, they are very friendly and make you feel comfortable. When creating my own stir-fry bowl, I added pasta, chicken, some veges...but I definitely put in the mango marinara (its sweet with a kick!) They have eggs, amazing sauces (you can sample some!) Teriyaki and BBQ are pretty popular with loads of spices. A tip is to fill small bowls (like pair up steak with veges) then fill the next bowl when you go up with shrimp, and so worth! 

They provide you with your choice of rice (brown, white) and warm tortillas at the table! If you tip the guys heating your food, give them a tip! They work hard, and fast, and are sweating while being super friendly! They will a bong on the drum thing? Haha. 

People that love the place, literally love it because it&#39;s the only restaurant they eat at when they come to downtown Naperville. Trust me, I know, I&#39;ve been living in this town for awhile, and the same people keep returning!

Then my shrimp tacos came (which were good) but my sons food was still not ready yet. All three of of the others had gotten their food made and started eating, they all were in line at the same time but for some reason my sons was the only one not done. So as my food sits getting cold as I wait with my child, people are still coming and going and my sons food is still not done. By the time we return to our table the rest of our group is DONE eating and my food is completely cold. We complained and the manager never came over to apologize. Not only that happened on our visit. There was a cook who was cleaning the grease off the wall and then swept the floor. Once he was done sweeping the floor he used his hand to empty the dustpan into the garbage, then touched the spatulas and someone&#39;s plate. He never washed or sanitized his hands.

A friend that works in the area introduced me to BD&#39;s, and quite frankly, it is a step up from my beloved Panda Express. Go munch on bamboo shoots Panda girl, you&#39;re about to become an ex. Well, not quite, as there aren&#39;t that many BD&#39;s around. Okay Miss Panda, will you take me back?

Anyways, where were we? Oh yes, BD&#39;s Grill. The format is simple. Mix and match your meat and greens, toss it in a bowl till it is overflowing and then hand it to the chefs to sizzle to perfection. Imagine Old Country Buffet style, only with much fresher ingredients and then add an 800 degree grill with massive sword style tongs to toss your goodies. Hungry yet? You bet.

Three tips for the savvy connoisseur of grilled goodness:

1. These folks are busy on the weekends, get here early and park your car on the Chicago St garage, there isn&#39;t any street parking left if you arrive later in the evening. 
2. Sign up for their email newsletter for discounts.
3. Come in on your birthday for a free meal on the house!

Panda Grill, when my other lover is not in neighborhood, will you have me back? Please? I hate to beg."

We were immediately seated and the hostess had us sit at a table of four and pulled up another chair. When my mom complained, the hostess somewhat reluctantly, moved us to another table that seated six.

I ordered a Pomegranate Raspberry lemonade and as the refills kept coming the ratio kept changing until I was just drinking raspberry lemonade.

The concept of this restaurant is really interesting. It&#39;s an interesting twist on an all you can eat buffet. You order a bowl per person, the next one is two dollars, and any one after that is free. You put together everything you want to eat in the bowl and there are plenty of sauces and spices. Then you give it to the chef and they cook it there right in front of you. 

I found it only to be good if you are trying to eat traditional Mongolian. I tried some of my brother&#39;s firecracker shrimp and it just didn&#39;t taste right. I got two bowls of duck and sirloin and both meats were good (I liked the sirloin more) and I just mixed spices and sauces willy-nilly style and it turned out good. There are suggested recipes to make certain dishes but I wanted to create my own inventions. Afterward, I tried to make mahi mahi fish tacos but the mahi mahi cooked on the same surface as all the other meats just tasted burned and charred so the fish tacos were a failure.

I didn&#39;t get to try either soup of the day. 

If you&#39;re looking for an asian fusion type meal, look no further, but it&#39;s going to get old real fast and trying to do something new (my brother tried chicken fajitas also) will be either hit or miss."

The guys at the grill are always enertaining regardless of how busy they are. During busy times there can be long lines to get to the grill and through the ingredients though. The ingredients are always fresh and tasty. Soup and salad is included with every meal which is a nice touch. Prices are a little expensive, but you can make it worth it by the variety that you put in your bowl (for the stir fry). Service is decent, maybe could be better, but overall is a good experience."

If I had to choose between Flat Top Grill and this place, I would go with Flat Top, and for one simple reason: here at BD&#39;s you get all of your stuff together in a bowl just like Flat Top. The difference is that here you stand in line while they cook your food and at Flat Top, you can go back to your seat and enjoy talking with the people you came to the restaurant with. We went here on a busy Friday night and we spent a solid 10-15 minutes standing in line waiting for our food to be done rather than relaxing at our table...not a big deal, but I go to a restaurant to have dinner with people, not to stand in line and watch them make my food.

As for price, my wife and I both had one drink and between that and the meal...it was $50 - which isn&#39;t bad, but it&#39;s not great for what you get. Again, Flat Top is more reasonable in this regard.

A word for BD&#39;s Mongolian Grill Mgmt: I get that your food is made in a Mongolian style, but that&#39;s where the comparisons end...you really don&#39;t need the ambiguously Asian pictures on the wall, or a gong that is occasionally hit at random.

As I re-read this review I realize that it is a bit negative. I would suggest watching the people at the grill once, they are very skilled with their instruments and the way they toss and egg around, crack it and dispose of the shell is very entertaining. Also, without a doubt you will leave here full, unless of course you don&#39;t put enough food in your own bowl."

I feel a little conflicted about this place.  And no matter how many people tell me that somehow it is safe, some voice inside always screams to me that it is never okay to let raw meat sit around or let people cross contaminate the non-meat items by touching the meat with their tongs as they put more crap in their bowls.

Aside from that, the one sauce I wanted to try, garlic chili, was empty, so I had to substitute with the kung pao.  It had a spicy kick to it, but was otherwise lacking in flavor. 

I got my bowl filled and brought it up to the counter and the griller tried to do something fancy with his tongs and my bowl and managed to spill the top half of my bowl onto my feet.  Yes, I was wearing sandals. Yes, there was meat juice.

I tried to go back and refill it, but the line was so busy and I just gave up. Forget it.  Good food at a restaurant shouldn&#39;t take this much work."

The grill looks VERY dirty and the noise level in the place is unbearable. I felt that I needed to shout for anyone to hear anything that I was saying. The meat piles that anyone could just dig their fingers into were a bit less than appetizing, and if you have a food allergy, do not even walk in the door.

If you are looking for a good stir fry place where you do not have to yell over screaming teenagers, drive ten minutes north to Stir Crazy. It is far more sanitary and the food and ambiance is much nicer."

The grilled taste that their stir fry technique gives to the food is way more satisfying to me. I love that it&#39;s not a soupy consistency. Also, I think that the quality of their meats is top notch! 

The grill masters are very entertaining and try to help everyone have fun during the short wait for your food at the grill. They sometimes do tricks with their grill sticks, sing, etc. They do more stuff if they see you give them a tip, and then they bang the gong a little bit!

They play pop music while you eat stir fry and do humorously cheesy things while they make the stir fry. Drinks are likewise kind of cheesy but decent. All you can eat stirfry (make multiple trips) is pretty darn good really, you make it how you want. 

Want more meat? Throw it in. Want it 100% vegetarian? No problem. Not to mention a good plethora of seasoning options too. You get served pretty fast, although the waiters aren&#39;t very attentive but who cares? They don&#39;t do much and I&#39;m sure college waiters are not very attentive anyway.

I feel as if they&#39;ve streamlined it back a bit over the years as they probably had too many options for people and no one knew what the heck to do when putting together their bowls.

So although there are still a wide variety of meats and fish to choose from, they&#39;ve cut it down and also tried to get creative by encouraging you to make a pasta bowl (with meatballs and marinara) or other ethnic type dishes.

If you only want to make one trip ($9.99 versus $12.99 for multiples) then you need to really pack in that bowl as once everything hits the flat-tops it tends to shrink up pretty good.  It still gives you a good quantity plus you get rice and/or tortillas at the table to accompany your creations.

Waitstaff was really attentive and not too pushy.  I really do love this place but I guess I liked it more when it had more spices/sauces/meats and less of the pasta-inspired things."

The first, and possibly the most exploited at this particular joint, is the idea of getting your money&#39;s worth.  The phrase &#34;getting my money&#39;s worth&#34; is probably uttered more than drink orders.  The waiters push the extra bowls like a dealer, where the first taste isn&#39;t nearly enough for satisfaction, and by the second bowl you&#39;re hooked.

When I eat here I suddenly become ravenous.  I pile my bowl high with meat products and the occasional broccoli stalk (to avoid any judgment from the staff and other patrons).  In the past they&#39;ve had trouble with putting out ingredients that are still frozen, but my last particular visit featured fully thawed food, which is a marked improvement.  

The nice thing about this place is that if you find the food to be less than tasty you can only blame yourself, and you&#39;re offered a second chance to get it right.  I recommend eating here if for no other reason than to get in touch with your subconscious American desire to stuff your face for as little money as possible."

That also includes brown or white rice or tortillas for the table.  Service was average at the table and it is worth the time that you stand around the grill, waiting for your food to be cooked, because the grillers do put on a pretty amusing show sometimes.

I had never been to a place where you actually get to create your own stir fry (I have since in the area but BD&#39;s is the only one where you get to choose how much, or little meat you get).  Basically you get a bowl and go to the buffet line.  You fill up your bowl with whatever you want in your stir fry.  There are a few different cuts of beef, chicken, seafood, pork and (at some locations) lamb.  You then add your veg, noodles and seasonings and/or sauces.  You can make your own creation or follow one of their recipe&#39;s.  

After you have your bowl filled you get in line at the grill and watch the cooks grill your masterpiece. Here&#39;s where the show begins, the cooks are masters at the round flat top grill.  After your creation is grilled you get to see how you did with your recipe.

Here&#39;s my creation:

Needless to say this place is a great change of pace and is very affordable.  They have 2 locations in Chicagoland (Naperville and Bolingbrook) as well as locations in Indians, Ohio, Maryland, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Missouri, Kansas, Colorado, Virginia and Michigan.

Dining in is fun: staff is pleasant, friendly, and attentive. (Note: They don&#39;t serve alcohol. You can bring your own from the liquor store in the same strip mall and they&#39;ll give you glasses.) The food options are lovely.

It&#39;s also super easy to order for pick-up (you can phone in an order or order online - they offer some freebies if you hit certain price markers with ordering online, which is really nice). Food is packaged thoughtfully and warm components are still warm when you go to eat them. 

The thing I really like about Chiba&#39;s is that there&#39;s variety - you can find non-fish options. You can find classic sushi options and classic roles. You can find some creative twists and &#34;Chiba Specials&#34; that are lovely. If you&#39;re a purist and want simple, they have it.

The lunch specials are great at only $8.95 for 3 makis or 7 piece sushi/sashimi. I always get the Philly roll, Snow crab California roll, and Eel avocado ($1 up charge for the Philly roll).

For their dinner menu, I recommend the dragon roll, spicy grill, flame dragon, crazy maki, black angel, beauty and the beat. But if you prefer deep fried rolls, the Sam Rittenberg is great, it&#39;s just very filling. If you like spicy tuna/salmon, you&#39;ll like the Bird of Paradise roll. The Pink Dragon is great if you like sweet fruity, tropical flavored. 

You really you can&#39;t go wrong with any of their maki or sushi. If you don&#39;t know what to get, just ask the waitress to recommend a few rolls based on your taste preferences and trust me, you won&#39;t be disappointed.

The place itself is tiny - maybe seating for 12, but that would be very tight.   It is BYOB.  I would say this is mainly takeout, I can&#39;t see myself eating in.  Easy parking, located in a strip mall.   I walked in around 5:30 on a Saturday to place my order to-go.  All the workers jumped up when the door opened, as they were just standing around talking, there was nobody else in the joint.

Super friendly people. I felt very welcomed as I looked over the menu.  They offered to give me water as I waited.   I placed an order for 3 rolls, and they told me that I can use the coupon on the menu to get a free california roll, awesome!   It took about 10 minutes to make my order, and then I left.   The 3 rolls were about $38, which I thought was decent, as I ordered their specialty rolls.   

I get home and the rolls were small, very very small.   I am used to specialty rolls being a bit bigger, hence the $13/roll price.   Everything tasted good and held up to the 20 minute ride home.

It appears to be family run, judging by the little boy who was hanging out at the back of the restaurant and kept peeking at us from behind the curtain.

We ordered the Rainbow, Spicy Crunchy Tuna, and Mexican rolls.  It is impossible to pick a favorite of the three.  This is fresh, delicious, well-made sushi.  Any time we have sushi, there&#39;s always one or two rolls that I&#39;m not as impressed with and leave the last few pieces for my husband to finish.  Not this time.  The Mexican roll is slightly spicy, but nothing I couldn&#39;t handle.  It is topped with a slice of jalapeno, which you can pick off with a chopstick if you want something more mild.

I ordered them for delivery and the driver arrived in 35 mins. The hibachi to go is very good. They give you nice portions. I ate my meal for two days and the meal includes a salad. Miso soup. Rice. Noodle and your choice of meat and vegetables. Looking forward to ordering from them again.

I had a spicy crunchy kanikama roll, it&#39;s good
The vegetable roll was really great too. 

However the side order hibachi chicken is quite dry and the garlic butter kinda overpowered it.
So was the fried rice, it taste good the first couple bites but it gets really heavy and a bit greasy because of the amount of the garlic butter they had cooked with it. To make things worse I don&#39;t know why I poured the creamy sauce all over the rice, just imagine putting ranch on Mac n cheese. It was just too much creamy and buttery for me. 

I will definitely order their sushi again but I will probably skip the hibachi items."

I had the specialty vegetarian roll (I believe it&#39;s called the Caterpillar), which was delicious - although I wish it had less mayonnaise or mayonnaise-type sauce they put on it. I absolutely love mayonnaise, just not so much on my sushi.

I also ordered the tempura veggies, which I initially thought they had forgotten about (and was relieved, as I was filling up pretty quickly with the specialty roll), since I was served my sushi roll first and the veggies about halfway through finishing my roll. I had anticipated getting the veggies first since it was listed as an appetizer - no biggie, I just ended up asking for a to-go box. My only complaint about the veggie tempura is that it was heavily breaded - I feel the best anything-tempura is when it&#39;s done with a much lighter touch. It was otherwise delicious.

This place is definitely much more of a take-out place rather than a sit-down restaurant, as the seating area is tiny and they were super busy with takeout orders - which however, did not negatively affect my experience, just something to note if you&#39;re looking for more of a restaurant atmosphere.

I would definitely stop by if I&#39;m ever in the area again and had a craving for sushi, but as someone else had noted, I wouldn&#39;t make a special trip."

I want to say, the staff was very friendly and the lunch prices were great. However, I have had better. I picked the lunch special - two rolls: spicy tuna and eel avocado for $8.95 and soft shell crab. I was okay with small rolls but there was very little tuna and eel. Instead, the tuna only it was mix with a mixture and the eel was very fatty.  Also, the SSC batter was three times more than the crab itself.  In addition, the lunch special includes miso soup and salad. The miso soup was salty and the salad was very sweet. I can only image the sugar level. I was really hoping for a great experience but instead I left disappointed."

Sam Rittenberg Roll
Black Angel Roll
Spicy Grill Roll
Dragon Maki
Spicy Crunchy Tuna Maki

We disagreed on our one favorite. I&#39;d have to say my favorite was the Dragon maki. This place was not expensive at all as other yelpers have agreed. All in, the bill was $55. Not bad.

The service was very good, and the lady that was serving our table was very sweet and thoughtful, and even gave us a free appetizer since we ordered a lot. The sushi was fresh and the fish, it seemed, was bought earlier that morning. I would recommend the spicy grill roll, it has three types of fish. The seaweed salad potion was good for the price, and the sashimi was, as I&#39;ve mentioned, very fresh. Good place to take a lunch date. I believe they deliver too."

Shrimp Hibachi Lunch Special - This came with a miso soup and salad. I really enjoyed the dressing on the salad. This was a lot of food. It had noodles, rice, veggies and shrimp. It was good.

3 Roll Lunch Special - This came with a miso soup and cucumber salad. I preferred the other salad. I chose Calamari Tempura, Unagi &amp; Avocado and Spicy Crunchy Shrimp. Sushi was okay, but not the best.

When we went for the first time the other night we got the boiled goyoza, which were tasty and good. Then we got two rolls. One was something sweetheart, and came in the shape of a heart with honey wasabi sauce on top. Just a dab of the sauce, not enough to hurt you, just enough to be tasty. This roll was very good, but the other was wonderful. I do not unfortunately remember the name of it, but it had spicy sauce, and was amazing. I really wish i remember more about it! Last we each had a piece of mackerel. The  nighiri pieces were large, fresh, and tasty, with no dressing or fixings. You also get free edamame side with your order! Great!

The owner himself was there, and ensured or meal was great and was very friendly.

The place is a bit small and probably not a good place to go with a big group unless you call ahead of time. There are two tables that sits four and three tables that sits two. 

Although the fish was super fresh, it seemed the fish was redder than normal. I was once told it is not uncommon for food coloring to be added to make the color more vibrant. I&#39;m not certain if this is what happened here, but don&#39;t think tuna can get that red. Maybe because it was close to sweetest day? IDK

Strolled in without reservations to a very small sushi joint run by a Chinese family.  Super friendly service from start to finish, and adorable children of the owners hanging out in the restaurant added to the family centric theme.

The wife and I ordered up a string of nigiri pieces which were very affordable (on average $2 per nigiri), but a bit to my disappointment, the quality of the fish is just above average.  The rice provided with each nigiri is just the right size (pretty small with large cut of fish draped nicely over it), but overpacked creating an almost gummy like texture instead of a soft pillow on which the fish sits on.

We ordered up rolls, and this is more where they shine.  The inventive flavors of the rolls and less overpressed rice around the outside are done well, and the sauces/combinations help escalate the flavors.

Verdict:  If you&#39;re looking for die-hard fresh fish nigiri/sashimi, this won&#39;t be it.  But if you want to go to a family friendly place that serves some inventive and tasty rolls, come check out Chiba.  We may come back again."

I am a sushi fanatic, and very particular about sushi. Of course, everyone wants their sushi to be exceptionally fresh, but I also appreciate a nice variety of signature maki rolls with different flavor profiles. Chiba delivers both of these things flawlessly!  
The space itself is very small, and doesn&#39;t have the best ambiance, especially for a romantic evening, but if you&#39;re in the area and want to carry out some outstanding sushi, definitely call them. The Godzilla Roll is a standout, as is the Beauty &amp; the Beat. I tried the Sakura roll last time, and it was very fresh and delicious. I&#39;m usually not a big California Roll person, typically opting instead for a spicy tuna roll. However, they currently offer a free Snow Crab California roll with any $30+ order, and it blew my mind how fresh this was. None of that imitation crab meat...this was real snow crab, and very tasty! On top of all this, their prices are quite reasonable. Obviously what they save on having a swanky space, they spend on quality ingredients."

enter chiba.  fresh, THICK cuts of sashimi (love salmon and yellowtail), and their rolls are delicious - make sure you ask for the house-made wasabi mayo!  and for all your non-sushi friends or maybe a picky kid, their hot kitchen menu was great!  my Philistine buddy doesn&#39;t eat sushi, so he got the &#34;hibachi chicken dinner&#34; which I scoffed at, but I shouldn&#39;t have been surprised - it was a generous portion and quite tasty!

you notice I didn&#39;t mention service.  welp, being from LA, I&#39;m accustomed to crappy service, especially in ma-and-pa sushi joints.  so if I get a friendly server that&#39;s a plus, but I don&#39;t expect it.  but Jim and his wife are super nice very hospitable; it almost seems like you&#39;re a guest in their quaint little house!  go there more than once and Jim will remember you - he&#39;s hilarious.

they could be charging more for their food, especially with the quality, but they don&#39;t.  their hard work is evident in every plate that hits the table, as well as the constant line of people picking up sushi to enjoy at home.  this place is amazing.  oh, and the BYOB is *hiccup* awesome =p"

They have lunch specials (hibachi, maki, nigiri, sashimi) Monday thru Saturday from 12-3:30 and on Sunday they offer 20% off. Niiiiiice!

We mostly order takeout, but we have also eaten in the restaurant, and service is good in both circumstances. The food is prepared quickly without sacrificing quality or taste. Their lunch special is fantastic. You get a really filling lunch with your choice of 2 or 3 rolls and miso soup and cucumber salad. The food is always fresh and delicious and the customer service is great. The chefs and waitstaff are all very nice and attentive, though its hard not to be attentive in such a small room. 

Speaking of the room, if you&#39;re coming with a group of more than 4 people, call ahead or get takeout. It&#39;s a very small room and that&#39;s the only reason I&#39;m not giving a full 5 stars. It can feel cramped but it isn&#39;t ever loud. The decor is simple but still keeping in theme with a Japanese restaurant. In spite of the tiny room, it&#39;s a good restaurant with really great food and is definitely worth a visit."

I&#39;ve not always been a big fan of sushi, although my expertise in the area is limited to a few pleasant encounters with the dish. Sashimi, however, is one of my favorite dishes... and to those who love it, we know the fresher the fish, the better the experience.

The fish here is great! I&#39;ve gone here for over 5 days straight for the reasonably priced [in comparison to common sashimi pricing] lunch special at 8.95 for 7 pieces of sashimi [chef&#39;s choice], a bowl of miso soup, cucumber salad, and a generous side of rice.

The cucumber salad is perfect, the tangy-ness of the vinegar balances well with the cucumber and carrots. The miso soup isn&#39;t overly seasoned or salty &amp; has the perfect amount of nori, and the portion is also perfect IMO. The rice is slightly sweet and topped with roasted sesame seeds, a delicious compliment to the sashimi.

Usually when I order the lunch special, I get 2 nice sized pieces of tuna, 2 nice sized pieces of fresh salmon, and 3 sliced pieces of red snapper.

To fully enjoy the flavor, I try to enjoy the dish as the japanese would. I never mix the wasabi with soy sauce, and I don&#39;t dowse the fish in wasabi either. I&#39;ve heard it described in the same way as drenching a good piece of chicken in ketchup.

I take a small dab of wasabi and put it on top of a piece of fish I am about to eat. Dip that in the soy sauce, then enjoy! In between different varieties of fish, I eat a piece of ginger to cleanse the palate so I may enjoy the delicate variances in flavor the different fish provide!

The atmosphere is also nice, but don&#39;t bring too many people! I&#39;ve seen groups of 6 squeeze in, but 4 would be more comfortable. The place is tiny, but it adds to its charm!

The food is always delicious and well-priced. I highly recommend eating in for a casual lunch or dinner, because although the place is somewhat small, it has a great atmosphere and the service is always phenomenal, and the waitstaff is really friendly.

The last time I was there, I was with three friends. We missed the lunch specials by about twenty minutes, and were pretty bummed, but the waitress quickly won us over by throwing in a free bowl of green tea or red bean ice cream (both of which are yummy, by the way) for each of us! And if that wasn&#39;t enough, she gave us a bowl of gummy bears to share, because she said that they taste great mixed with the ice cream, and she was right!

chiba-japanese-darien,Brian B.,wx-PYvY0MOE7TBtmFHvHCQ,"Portland, OR",0,1,0,41,12,2DLgJmNdJ5YysMiiPH4jMA,5.0,2013-02-06,"Absolutely phenomenal time at Chiba. My wife and I were celebrating our seventh anniversary, and sushi always seems to be our big event meal. I was looking for something in the burbs as I didn&#39;t want to traverse the city only to be stuck down there, and I know you can find those killer sushi places in little strip malls in random little towns. This place had the best reviews of any place I scoped out, so I went with it. 

BYOB, so we packed up a nice bottle that our neighbor gave us for making her family meal, and made the short drive to Darien. 

Upon pulling into the parking lot I immediately became sketched out. The place just didn&#39;t feel right. Didn&#39;t have that immediate charm I was expecting, and I worried for a second that I&#39;d been led astray into the world of over-sauced, frozen-fished, meh sushi. This feeling wouldn&#39;t last long, I promise.

Once we sat down and started talking with Jim, we were transformed to a world that exists in a realm with the rest of the amazing restaurants in the world. Jim is knowledgable, amicable, funny, interesting, willing to give his opinion, and extremely helpful when one is attempting to peruse their highly intriguing menu to make something of a rational decision. He told us we had to have the Mexican, the Bage, and the Black Angel, the rest was up to us. In all we ordered five rolls and a bit of sashimi. While I wouldn&#39;t order the sashimi here again, the rolls were simply divine. The dragon, black angel, shrimp tempura and spider were some of the best of those I&#39;ve ever had. The dragon in particular matched the smokiness of the eel with a perfect avocado, and enough unagi sauce to melt in your mouth without being overly mushy. 

The highlights wer the bage roll and the Mexican roll. Smoked salmon, cream cheese, deep fried. Like the greatest appetizer you could ever imagine. Not greasy in the slightest, crunchy, still soft, a wonderful mixture of textures. The Mexican was incredibly fresh tuna with avocado, jalapeno, a bit of tempura, cilantro and ponzu sauce. Just brilliant. Perfect way to kick off our meal. 

By the end we were stuffed, happy, gave Jim the rest of our unfinished bottle of wine, and were ready to head home for scotch and Top Chef. Escaped with $80 for a massive meal of sushi. Can&#39;t beat that. 

Places like Chiba deserve your business. They don&#39;t fret about creating the &#34;perfect atmosphere&#34; through decor or location. They just do it by crafting some of the best sushi I&#39;ve had in the states, all through intelligent, friendly customer service, and a desire to make people happy with good food.

Why can&#39;t every restaurant be like this?"

Then split a side order of fried rice for $3 which was delicious and perfectly sized for a little appetizer.  Then had 3 rolls a yellowtail and scallion, dragon, and calla Lilly.  We had $5 off $25 coupon and our bill ended up at $27.50!  And we were stuffed.  So we tipped generously and will definitely be back.

Our server was very attentive, since it was our first visit, he made recommendations about their food &amp; drink menu, taking care to explain our options. 
The salsa was really good and the chips were served warm and perfectly salted. 
The margaritas are based on your choice of tequila and they feature a really nice selection of flavors. 
I had Chile Rellenos, they were delicious! 
My favorite part was the fried ice cream-made with chocolate ice cream... a nice twist!"

Tried a couple of appetizers and eh. The chips are a little different, but not in a bad way. Their guacamole, however, had a weird oily taste to it that got worse as we ate. We stopped and didn&#39;t finish it. If you know me, I can eat guac and chips all night. 

Service was also eh.

Worth trying if you like Mexican food and judge for yourself. Perhaps it was an off night when we were there."

We started with Margaritas which I enjoyed, though one of us thought his was too sweet. 

We had guacamole as a starter, I really appriciated that it wasn&#39;t loaded with salt. We ran out of chips twice and the staff was quick to bring more and brought additional salsa upon request.

Our entres ran from  $16-20. My chilies rellenos included two large stuffed poblano peppers and refried beans. It was tasty and well worth the price to me. My partner had tilapia ala veracruzana, he said the flavors were good but he felt the portion size of the fish was small for $19.

The atmosphere wasn&#39;t very mexican with two flat screen TVs playing NFL football, and being a busy Friday night the place was loud so not the best place to carry on conversations.

Our waitress did a prety good job following up and keeping our drinks filled without being bothersome. The only miss was salt on one Margarita glas where no salt had been requested. 

In summary, we all agreed we would go back again."

Unfortunately after many visits I can give no longer give them the benefit of the doubt. The margaritas are good. The guacamole is ok. The enchiladas can be good, but they are not consistent. The service has been worse every time we have dined there. 
Last night was probably our worst experience. Our server wasn&#39;t attentive and looking at other tables while taking our order. She was in such a hurry she didn&#39;t confirm or really listen. 

We ordered dinner for our son and when she came back 10 minutes later we placed our order. She failed to put our order in as we did not get our food until about 30 minutes after my son finished his dinner. Before realizing that we had not received our food she asked if we wanted dessert. 

The service is so bad I do not think I will be returning to Mia&#39;s anytime soon."

I came for a family birthday dinner recently, and issues started immediately after we arrived. We had a reservation, but had to wait almost 45 minutes before we were seated. We actually would have been waiting longer if my dad hadn&#39;t asked the host about how much longer it would be until our table would be ready. He had already asked the host a couple other times before this, and we kept getting told, &#34; a couple more minutes&#34;. Unfortunately, the host admitted that she had forgotten about us. To drink I had the Cadillac margarita and mojito.  My Cadillac margarita was good, but not memorable. My second drink was a pineapple mojito, and that was a well balanced cocktail that I enjoyed better. 

Once we were seated, we got to meet our &#34;fantastic&#34; waitress. The entire time she was hard to get a hold of to place orders with. Initially, I assumed it was because she was overwhelmed with a lot of tables , but after I noticed her standing around and laughing with another server, I assumed differently.

The guacamole was one of the appetizers we ordered, and it tasted fresh and had a nice kick to it. The quesadilla was okay, but pretty bland. Our group ordered a big variety of different main entrees, and everyone seemed to like what they got, but very few of us were blown away. I would like to see this place amp up both their service and food flavor."

And then I remembered Mia&#39;s and how we hadn&#39;t tried it yet. So we came.

The atmosphere is lively and colorful and I think they did a decent job of blocking seats from the draft of the door. We were seated immediately but unfortunately sat waiting for a server for awhile, thankfully with chips and salsa. Apparently nobody told our server she had a new table.

The chips were very crispy and a bit on the greasy side, and the salsa was thick and well seasoned. The menu has many taco options, as well as burritos, enchiladas and so forth. 

Thankfully our server came and she was apologetic and attentive, and we ordered right away. I had shrimp tacos and the husband went with steak. They were really good, and I like that they had a bit fancier options, with handmade salsas and fresh veggies. The tacos don&#39;t come with sides, but rice, beans, potatoes, veggies and other choices are reasonably priced. We got some rice and it was well seasoned.

Overall I was impressed with the flavors and general atmosphere. I think we&#39;ll be back, and hopefully with faster service next time."

I went here this past weekend with a group of friends. So glad we had a reservation - the place was packed! Mia Cantina is located in what used to be a quilting store but went through a huge transformation into a delightfully fun bar and restaurant. 

The food was great.  I ordered the Carne Asada that came with fried plantains, rice, and a small salad mixture - I finished everything on my plate.  My husband enjoyed the chicken tacos. And though there was a slight mix up with his order (kind of expected since they just opened), it was fixed quickly.

My friends had the Baja Fish Tacos, the Sofrito tacos (these looked amazing!), and enchiladas.  Everyone left our table happy and satisfied with our meal.  Will definitely be hitting this place up again."

It was packed but knew we would have to wait without reservations.  I joked with my friend that we are going to wait awhile to be seated by the kitchen, the door or the bathroom...knowing my luck.  Well, she won cause she guessed kitchen.....ding ding ding ding.  Sat in front of the brightest lights, watched the kitchen, saw help just standing there. One guy was doing stretches. 

Finally, our waitress comes over and looks pissed off.  Doesn&#39;t tell us anything about the specials.  Just got our drink orders.  Came back to get our order and she had no clue.  I ordered the tampiquena.  Didn&#39;t even ask how I wanted my steak or what type tortillas.  She says the cook just automatically cooks them how they should be. . Didn&#39;t see her until after food was served by someone else.  Table never approached considering I was sitting in front of the kitchen where they were sanding.  Finally, I got the attention of someone to ask for more chips and salsa since we just got an order of guacamole too.  He gave attitude. 

Anyway, the food was good.  It was a bit on the cold side.  The cheese in the enchilada was solidified. 

Finally ask for check and boxes.  This is when I saw a million servers finally come to my table.  I was completely rushed out.  We had a ton of food to take home and this girl comes back with this tiny take home box.  Are you kidding me? 

I&#39;ll write off this experience to hoping it was just a bad experience with service.  One more chance that&#39;s it cause high dollar for rice and beans isn&#39;t worth it."

Yes, you read it right, frozen lettuce, and my mexican chili was watery and flavorless.

We sat at the bar and waited to order drinks.  The bar was not as busy as the amount of time we waited to order our drinks.  Someone brought us chips and salsa (very good salsa) don&#39;t know who it was because she came from behind and left quickly.  By the time we ordered drinks and were told they couldn&#39;t make a pina colada because they were out of pineapple juice, I decided I no longer wanted to eat there.  The $8.95 small margarita wasn&#39;t even that good.  The service here leaves much to be desired.

I have been here 4 times now and while the food is very good and I like it a lot (would say 3-1/2 to 4 stars for food), the service leaves much to be desired. On my most recent trip, Friday 6/24, we sat at the table for 20 minutes without getting any water even though we asked 3 different people (not including our server). In fact, we received the waters after our orders were taken, and our starter arrived, and minutes before the main course arrived. Now it was a Friday and they were busy when we arrived, and it was Rotary Fest - but to be completely left alone for 20 minutes by our server is unacceptable. In fact - we had to flag her down on several occasions. Since I was facing the rest of the restaurant I saw no other tables, except in her section, experiencing the same service. So maybe it was just her? I doubt it however since every time I have been here the service is sub par at best. I love the food, and the atmosphere is great too - but the service will keep me away."

The owner is extremely pleasant to deal with and was visually busy.  It doesn&#39;t look at though the hours on Yelp! are correct as they are open for lunch.  I will say when I left, it was packed.  Good for them!  I really liked the vibrant colors on the interior and the bar area is very cute and had TVs on and was very inviting.  I judge most Mexican spots by two things: margaritas and chips and salsa.  One hit the spot and that was the margaritas.  As others have commented, they are very good.  I got the Cadillac and it tasted extremely fresh with their own lime juice concoction.  The chips and salsa did not hit the mark for me.  The chips are a few layers thick but crumble very quickly.  If you&#39;re like me and split up one chip into a few salsa dips, these won&#39;t really work.  The salsa itself was okay but was tomato heavy and could benefit from some onions and cilantro or peppers of some sort.  In fact, I think the food as a whole can benefit from some spice.  I&#39;m not saying ghost chiles or something but just a bit more pop.  i got the sopes and I enjoyed them.  I think the dough was a bit on the raw side for me and I would like it more crispy and flaky, like a pie dough.  The pastor was tasty.  Also the sopes were huge!  There were three of them and they were all about the size of a small burger.  I&#39;m used to sopes being small and more appetizer sized but I&#39;m not complaining, just pointing out.  The flavor was decent but I think it could use something more.  Overall good food, great service but nothing really blew me away.  I look forward to going back though."

What a bunch of crap! For one, we get there on a Friday night. Place was hopping and it was smelling soooooo good! 
 We walked in and got a table for 4. We were told 30 minute wait. No problem! We were seated and our waitress was friendly enough. It did take her a good 10 mins to realize we were there.  She apologized for the delay and said there was a mix up. Again, no problem. She took our drink order and pointed out that the frozen margaritas were not so hot because they water down the alcohol. Hmm ok! We ordered our margaritas on the rocks. Also, a cheese quesadilla and flautas appetizer to start.  I asked for the flautas to not have any cheese or sour cream. 
 So we wait.... And wait... And wait... 20 mins into the wait, the drinks come. Who would have guessed, the margarita I ordered was frozen instead of on the rocks, it Just so happened that the flautas came and quesadilla as well. You guessed it, the flautas had  cheese and sour cream. So made incorrectly. I asked them to remake the flautas and apology was given and I said &#34;hey it&#39;s ok one out of two isn&#39;t bad I&#39;ll keep the frozen margarita&#34; ... Yeah I was just trying to make it easier on them.  Well, the flautas were nothing special at all and the cheese quesadilla my companion ordered looked smaller than the takeout place we usually order from and twice the price. Lol. We then order entrees. I had steak tacos and rice. They charge you extra for the rice but whatever I wanted it! Big mistake. The Carne Asada tacos were just ok. Like actually on the verge of being boring. The rice was god awful. I couldn&#39;t even eat it. It was left. Plain, cold, bland, hard, it was like one of those cheap box mixes. Really!??? My companion liked his fried ice cream. Said it was good and my friend liked her carnitas tacos. We all agreed it wasn&#39;t worth the price or value. 
 The location is great for this business and its ok because they have a lot of middle aged yuppies to suck money from. If it were not for those two things, this place would be out of business. The waitress was extremely scarce and I had to chase her down to pay the bill. We were there 2 1/2 hrs!! Not of our will. It was all of the waiting time for food to come to the table. Absolutely ridiculous. This place deserves to be shut down. What a rip off."

The last time I was at Mias was March 8th. There were four of us out for dinner and we had not seen each other in awhile and were looking to enjoy our evening and catch up on some girl talk. 
The place was hopping for a Tuesday night. There was a steady stream of customers. It took a few minutes for the waiter to come over so we flagged down the hostess and asked if she could get us some water. She did and when our waiter showed up we put in a drink order. The margaritas arrived and not everyone had a lime in their glass. We asked for another lime and that took quite awhile. He never asked if we cared for another drink once he delivered the first drinks.
We ordered guacamole for an appetizer and put in our dinner order and everything seemed to come to the table within an appropriate amount of time. 
After dinner, our plates were not picked up (despite our stacking them on the end of the table). We were presented with the bill before he checked to see if anyone wanted dessert or coffee. We ordered coffee and our waiter told us that it would take up to 10 minutes because their coffee pot is so slow. We all got the impression that he was trying to discourage us from staying for coffee. We said we would wait. The decaf coffees came out almost immediately and the regular coffee arrived as the others were finished with their coffees. We were not offered refills and we were never asked if we wanted dessert. 
I&#39;d like to say that this happened only once out of my three visits, but, that is not the case. Each and every time I have gone, I have run into sloppy and/or slow service. Either they forget to bring something that was ordered or the wait staff disappears. Initially I felt this was due to the newness of the restaurant. However, this is not the owners first place. He should know how to train waiters/waitresses. What about the bus boys? They see dishes piled up at the end of the table and walk pass? What&#39;s that all about? They are a new restaurant in DuPage county and doing well so hire some more staff if there&#39;s not enough to handle the dinner crowd and train them. Where&#39;s the management? Shouldn&#39;t they be walking around making sure that customers are happy and staff is doing their job?
The food... I think they have a limited but very complete menu. The food is made with fresh ingredients and prepared very well. The black beans are pureed. I think they tasted great but if you&#39;re not expecting that I guess it could be a bit of a shock. I like their food very much. It&#39;s a big leap from your standard tacos and enchiladas. I have no issues with the food at all. The one margarita I had was also quite good. Too bad I wasn&#39;t offered another because I would have bought one. 
I am giving them 3 stars for the food and the ambiance. I truly hope this restaurant makes it and is part of the DG community for a long time. If that is to happen though, I think it is going to have to improve on their service. You can have the best chef in town but if people leave your restaurant feeling like they were not served well it will leave them with a bad taste and not a great desire to return."

Been here on a 40 degree day and begged the waiter to open a window due to it being at least 80 inside. Returned this week, 95 degrees outside, comparable 85 degrees inside. Ugh. Add the heat from the jalapenos and I&#39;m dying. I overheard the people next to us saying the same thing. Please turn on the air conditioning and make it comfortable for your customers!! (68-72 is comfortable! Not 80+!!)"

That said, food was marginal and overpriced. I ordered grilled chicken tacos. Meat was dry, portion was very small and no sides (such as rice) came with, despite it costing $10.  My son had fajitas.  They were ok, but rather expensive at $18 and, again, a small portion.  

Service was not too good.   Waitress clearly had not had much experience.


I&#39;d go back out of convenience/location, but definitely better options exist (Las Palmas for value ands Los Dos for authenticity/quality.  As I said, they probably will survive just with the location, but I can&#39;t  say the food was that good or that the value was there either."

I also love Mexican food.  I had 3 margaritas the night I visited. The Margaritas were excellent. They tasted fresh and not watered down at all. The only thing that was disappointing was that they were not served in a Margarita glass. They were served in a stemless regular glass. For the price ($11 for the ultimate Margarita), I was expecting a big Margarita glass. But that&#39;s fine, they are totally worth it. 

As far as the food is concerned, I think there are some areas that need improvement. First we ordered the guacamole appetizer. It was fresh and home made, but we ordered the spicy and it was mild. We were not offered the chips and salsa at the table so we requested them and the waitress gladly brought them over. Our waitress was very nice. The chips were thin and broke easily, not restaurant quality chips and neither was the salsa. It was more like just a red sauce out of a jar.  I ordered the chicken tacos from &#34;The taqueria&#34; section of the menu. I was really shocked as to how flavorless the tacos tasted. The chicken was kind of chewy and not seasoned at all. The taco order came with 3 plain tacos. They were served on a corn tortilla with chicken and a few cilantro leaves on top. I called the waitress and ordered a side of rice and beans to be able to tolerate the bland taste of the tacos and make the dish a full meal. The rice and beans were okay, not authentic but decent. Temperature wise, I was kind of disappointed as they were not hot but more like room temperature and I like my food to be served hot. My friend ordered a tres leches cake for dessert, and it was actually really good. 

The staff were really nice. I might give it another try but not sure yet. 

One last thing, the place is kind of small and we were seated towards the back on the long bench you share with others.  There was no privacy at all as you are sitting right next to other customers sharing the same space. I personally don&#39;t like to sit on top of others and prefer more of a private dining experience."

mias-cantina-downers-grove,Critic R.,GdIDWaVo5f_O-WorvOU69w,"Westmont, IL",0,1,0,0,3,VFocnP8Sq1bL1NPxg-vrxA,2.0,2016-03-07,"Grabbed a quick lunch last week and dinner over the weekend, so having had a little better than a one-off opportunity for this new joint, I feel it is fair to rate them.  Unfortunately, for the 2 times I&#39;ve been in, the place doesn&#39;t do it for me.

For starters, to be fair, the variety of Mexican restaurants around the west suburbs makes a Mexican restaurant a tough venture, mostly because now I know what an excellent Mexican restaurant can be like (Bien Trucha), or even a really good one (Aguamiel).  Mia&#39;s is just another like every other, and does not distinguish itself for me.  With all the competition, I would hope that new Mexican restaurants do something to try to set themselves out beyond just a Tequilaria, but alas that seems to be all Mia&#39;s is really shooting for.

When I was seated on both visits, a generous portion of chips and salsa were immediately delivered to the table.  However, the chips and salsa were ordinary overall.  I did appreciate that the chips were served warm, and the flavor was good with a little salt to push against the oily tortilla flavor, but the salsa was too much tomato, with very little citrus, cilantro or onion expressed.  This made the salsa very tomato-soupy with no real salsa kick.  Unfortunate.

The food is traditional Mexican - American fare, and by that I mean you will find the staples of the run-of-the-mill Mexican restaurant in the US:  tacos, enchiladas, burritos and fajitas.  There is a fair variety of appetizers, but again just common choices - queso, camarones ceviche, guac, etc.  For lunch, I ordered the Sopa Azteca, which was actually the best thing I had between my two visits,  It was a well balanced broth between savory and spicy, with just the right amount of cilantro to check the salt and the spice.  But the tortilla chips in the soup seemed too stale and chewy.

For the dinner visit, I had the Tacos Nortenos (steak).  Unfortunately, I did not find these too good.  In fact, the flavors were all very muted and overall missing any tang or kick.  As a contrast, the steak tacos at Neat are very well-rounded and flavorful with a delicious, savory and tangy meat marinade balanced against the sweet and sour of the green apple salsa.  Mia&#39;s taco&#39;s were a rather big miss for me, as the steak tacos for a Mexican Restaurant should be much better.

The atmosphere is very nice and colorful, but nothing inspired.  In any event, this did not color my impression of Mia&#39;s for the better.  Unfortunately, Mia&#39;s is just another like the others - a Mexican restaurant that will probably be a serviceable Cinco watering hole, but not for a regular south-of-the-border meal.  For that, I&#39;ll stick with the operations that do it better.

Grades:  Food - C-minus; Drinks - incomplete (I only ordered bottled beers); atmosphere - C; service - incomplete (it wasn&#39;t great, but its not fair to rate since they just opened so they need time to iron out kinks)

Over all - C-Minus"

Hands down the BEST chips and salsa I have ever had. The guacamole was delicious and served on a big bowl that could easily feed 3-4 people. The chips were hot each time they came out and crunchy but not too hard like I have had in other places. I had the carnitas at the recommendation of our server and they hit it out of the park. Shredded pork, cheese, salsa verde and fresh guacamole on soft flour taco shell. My boyfriend had the enchilada suizas and we both really liked them. To drink I had a margarita la perfecta made with silver Patron and Cointreau, no complaints. He had a frozen raspberry margarita and the taste of the house tequila really over powered the raspberry flavor and left a lot to be desired. That was really the only negative in terms of the food. It was very loud in there and they were slammed, but I guess that is to be expected given how good their food was!  Our server Eber was very attentive and helpful. Very busy at 6:30 on Saturday nights and glad we made a reservation.

I considered giving 4 stars, because of the congested atmosphere of the restaurant. However, I do believe that this is part of what also makes this a nice place. It is quite impressive how they manage to pack a complete restaurantand bar into such a small corner store.

Service 2 Stars 
Food 2 stars (minus 1 star for the Ceviche)

Cocktails forgive many sins and also make food taste better than it is.  That is truly the case here.  The service on a busy Saturday night (we had reservations for 6:30 and we (party of 4) were seated promptly) was slow.  10 minutes - no water but finally a waitress arrived.  Cocktails for 3 arrived 10 minutes later, the 4th, a soft drink, was forgotten.  The ceviche appetizer was a huge portion - Menu described it as citrus marinated shrimp with fresh tomatoes, onion, cilantro and jalapenos.

Traditional ceviche is seafood (usually scallops) cooked in pure lime juice.  This was anything but - shrimp had been cooked firmly and then tossed in a dressing that had some citrus juice, but was overdone with cilantro, an occasional tomato piece, onion and the jalapenos were missing.  It was, with all of that, bland.  Lots of something does not always make it better.

Two had enchiladas trio, one had shrimp tacos sauteed with Tequila, the fourth had Pollo a la Parrilla (chicken tacos).  Food was average plus.  The enchiladas trio had three, one each with mole, verde and ranchero.  The mole was very good, the other two were OK.  The tacos all got good marks for flavor and temp when being served.

We did pass on desert.  The acoustics are awful and the place was packed.  Reservations are likely a must on Friday or Saturday.  The cocktails will keep the crowd coming back.  The margaritas were fresh and loaded with good flavor.  Mia&#39;s does need to be better at managing a full house - the staff was clearly struggling to be reasonably timely although once the orders were placed, the pace picked up nicely.  

It will take a while longer for the kitchen to get up to producing top quality entrees, but this will be a great addition to the Downers restaurant scene."

We live in DG and want to support small businesses and my Mexican husband was looking forward to having a local Mexican restaurant.  At 12:30, we walked in and there were maybe 3 tables full.  The bar is right at the entrance and the floor was littered with tortilla chips.  I assumed that someone must have just left, but they were really everywhere.  We were quickly seated and the waiter brought chips and salsa and took our drink orders.  The chips were probably the best part  of the meal.  Freshly fried corn tortillas, not too salty.   The salsa was ok.  Zero heat, heavy on the canned tomato sauce.  (We make it fresh all the time and know good salsa).  I ordered steak tacos and he got the baja fish tacos.  My steak tacos were really, really good.  His fish tacos were pretty decent,  The batter was excellent and you could tell they were freshly prepared.  The portions are quite small, but I actually appreciate not having a huge plate of food.  Beans were pretty pasty.  Looked like they had been warming a long time without much liquid.  The rice was just ok.  We each took a bite and didn&#39;t finish.  The whole time we were there, the staff seemed to be milling about, talking.  When we left about 35 minutes later, the chips were still all over the floor in the entry way by the bar!  I worked as a waitress through college and there is no way we would not be hustling during our &#34;downtime&#34;.  Just lackluster.  I hope they step up their game so we can keep a restaurant in that spot.   7/7/16 EDIT:  Adding a star.  We want back last night with friends and it was a better experience.  The tacos nortenos are SO GOOD.  Get them with corn tortillas.  Perfect portions, you won&#39;t feel like a glutton after.  Better service overall."

First off I asked if they were a tequilla bar and I was told yes they were. So we arrive and sit at the bar while we wait for our table.  When I think tequilla bar I am anticipating a minimum of 10 different tequillas available.  Mia&#39;s cantina only had Milagro on display.  For those of you that need help that&#39;s only one type of tequilla. Then we are at our table and they bring over chips and salsa.  Now let me note that the &#34;salsa&#34; was like tomato water with a few specks of cilantro and onion maybe in it.  So thin that you needed to use the chip as a spoon.  Well using a chip as a spoon only leant its way to breaking the chip in the bowl of tomato water.   Now we ordered guacamole thinking they would also come with a chip that was more sturdy well we guessed wrong.  So we ended up mixing the chips into the guacamole and just eating it with our forks at that point.  So here we are at the entree we all ordered different tacos off their menu and decided to share them with each other.  Well let me tell you the tacos were tasteless.  Well needless to say the &#34;tequilla bar&#34; that only offered one type of tequilla and had the super crumbly chips and tasteless tacos is what you are after then please go at your own risk. But if you want real Mexican food and great service head up the street and go to Alfredo&#39;s.

When we went to pay, one of the gift cards (never used) read a $0 balance. We knew that couldn&#39;t have been right because my friend had literally taken the gift card off the sticky tack that it come on. We talked to the server, and then a manager. They were very understanding and the manager took care of it no problem. That&#39;s the type of customer service to makes me want to keep going back to a place. 
Aside from that little hiccup, the food was great! We had a few appetizers to start. The warm pretzel and dips was delicious!! We also got sangria and it was some of the best sangria I&#39;ve ever had. YUM! 
I had the Korean steak tacos and they had amazing flavor! I saved one so I could bring it home for my husband to try. Very good! We sat on their patio which was nice! Seemed like the inside gets a little loud later in the evening but we had a really nice time on the patio. The service was great. Our server was attentive and our food came out pretty quickly. I will definitely be back!!"

The first thing I noticed about Fuller House is the noise level.  There is seating upstairs and on the main floor, but even on a hot summer day our group preferred to sit on the patio, so we could at least hear each other talk.

The patio is cute and set up like a backyard with lots of picnic-style tables as well as some tall tables.  We came here on a weeknight, and there was already a wait for a table, but even so it was only about 20 minutes.  The taller tables are better suited for two, not three, like how we were seated.  We were constantly shifting around our plates and drinks trying to make it work.  

The service could have been better, as it became frustrating when our waitress just wasn&#39;t listening and repeatedly brought us the wrong drinks.  She was kind of dismissive about it too.

I ordered a margherita pizza and tried my friend&#39;s truffle parmesan fries - the food here is definitely good, and I would come back to try any of the sandwiches, pizzas, or other shareables on the menu.

There&#39;s a solid list of cocktails, the Hinsdale Mule is great.  The beer list is equally good, I had a strawberry draft beer that was a perfect summer brew - so good I had two!

Food and drinks are good here, but I wasn&#39;t a fan of the cramped table space and slightly awkward service."

Growing up in the area, I can definitely see how this place is the ideal watering hole in Hinsdale. 

Sadly I was DD that night, so I didn&#39;t order a cocktail. I did get a taste of the Hinsdale Mule, and it was one of the best Moscow mules I&#39;d ever had! For starters, we ordered the 312 Fried Wisconsin Cheese Curds and Buffalo Shrimp (I heard this was a must-try). Both were delicious! Where can I get a bottle of the southwest ranch? 

For my entree, I ordered the Steak Caesar (Had I not come from a kid&#39;s birthday party with pizza and cake, I would&#39;ve had a much larger appetite to order a bigger entree), which was tasty. My boyfriend, being quite the burger connoisseur, ordered the Day + Night burger, which he loved. The truffle parm fries were out of this world, and that&#39;s coming from someone who&#39;s not huge on truffle. I also tried a straggler from the animal fries without sauce on it, and it was delicious. You can never go wrong with plain fries!

To top off the meal, we all shared the Gooey S&#39;mores Brownie and the Whiskey Banana Pudding. Both were sooo good!! Highly recommend either to top off your meal!

Service from everyone was excellent and the ambiance was awesome. I can definitely see why this place attracts so many people! Perfect spot for friends and family."

Had to wait for a table for a few minutes and ordered drinks at the bar. I enjoyed my blackberry lemonade and they have a wide variety of beers.

I started with the cheese curds- yum! I ordered the West Coast burger and almost felt like I was back at In N Out! Large portion- I only finished about half of my burger. (It was perfectly sized for my husband though) I upgraded to the truffle parm fries and they were great! The mayo dipping sauce was a great pairing.

Service was attentive and the restaurant looks awesome!"

They have a great thing going here and have invested a lot of money into the place.  It definitely has a sport bar feel but there is enough room to get away from the sports if you want including a second floor.  Prices responsible for the area.  The decor is kind of industrial look which is great and different compared to typical suburb establishments.  Parking can be a bit tricky but not unreasonable.  Go...you will like it."

For starters, the decor. Their unique, rustic, chic look is to die for. Our waitress gave us a little history on the different pieces they used in the interior decorating - wood from an old barn, panels from the previous hardware store, etc. Pretty cool stuff! Their huge winding staircase to the upstairs is my favorite.

Both times I&#39;ve been to Fuller House now we&#39;ve had a party of 5-6 and have been sat at a booth/table in the upstairs corner. A great spot for larger parties. Brian was our server the first time and then we had Molly. Both were super awesome and so fun to talk to. They really know the menu well and are great at giving suggestions.

I&#39;ve loved all the food I&#39;ve tried and I highly suggest the following...
- Harvest salad (it&#39;s huge!)
- Brisket chili (a cup is perfect, the bowl is really big)
- Tater tots (the perfect crispy texture)
- FH chicken sandwich (filling, delicious, and the bourbon BBQ is amaze)
- Brisket nachos (I mean come on, brisket baby!)
- Cheese curds (standard and satisfying)
- Cole slaw (a great side - not your average slaw, I think they include broccoli)

The drink selection is also rockstar status. The Woodford Reserve old fashioned I had was the best OF I&#39;ve EVER had. So smooth, perfect sweet to bitter ratio, and packed a good punch without being overbearing. Phil the bartender working that night clearly has some serious skills behind the bar. I&#39;ve also enjoyed their cucumber cooler (which I believe is seasonal) and their ginger pear cocktail (too sweet for me).

If you haven&#39;t made your way to Fuller House yet, GO. Go now. I&#39;m already planning my next trip back..."

It was a packed house on a Saturday evening so we grabbed seats at the bar. The soft pretzel is amazing, alongside the delicious cheese dip it comes with. I had the amish roasted chicken with Thyme fries, it was a large portion and very well seasoned. My partner had a bison burger all customized with the works.

The restaurant is designed beautifully down to the last detail! I loved the lighting, bar, exposed brick, chairs, the bathroom- all were just great! I liked that it has a second level too, but the people aren&#39;t visible so you don&#39;t make awkward eye contact with people above you.

Our server was super sweet, service was great throughout the entire experience.

I like that they have a strong emphasis on whiskey. I feel like it&#39;s not easy to find a good whiskey cocktail around here, but this place has them! If you are hesitant about whiskey, try one of these bad boys! They are well mixed with a great balance of flavors. I tried their Chicago sunrise and their Old fashioned and enjoyed each immensely ($9)! 

For food, I ordered their Harvest Salad. If I wasn&#39;t trying to eat healthy, I would&#39;ve gone for one of their burgers or pizza because those looked amazing, but was really happy with my salad choice. This thing was BOSS- mixed greens (not a leaf of iceberg in site!), red onion, apple, dates, creamy feta, pecans, and pulled chicken. It was a great mix, and a huge salad. The vinaigrette was good too- not too acidic by any means! I ate the whole thing! ($12)

My guy ordered their burger, which he also ate all of. He said it was good, but not the best he&#39;d ever had. I tried some of their house cut fries off his plate and thought they were great- not too big or small, crispy, well salted.

For the location and what they had going on inside, I thought the prices were more than reasonable. I will be back!"

And judging by how packed this place is every night of the week, I am not the only one who feels this way.  They even have valet parking on the weekends as there is literally a traffic jam on this once sleepy corner.

Hard to believe that this bustling, two level space once housed the local hardware store for there are no traces of that era to be found.  But Fuller House commands First street with outdoor seating and large windows looking out.

Not wanting to deal with the crowds and knowing that they don&#39;t take reservations for parties under 6 (and not even those on Sundays) we went on a Monday night.  The place was pretty busy although I scored a table inside by the front windows.  There are plenty of TV&#39;s to catch your favorite game on and the bar was pretty crowded.  Know before you go that it is pretty loud in the place so this is not going to be a great conversation spot.

We went with our server&#39;s reccos of the guac and chips and buffalo shrimp to start.  Pretty tasty although not remarkable.  I had the fish tacos as my entree which was fine but my friend&#39;s salad really was the winner of the night.  They have a decent wine list and the speciality cocktails are also quite good.

Our server, while friendly, went missing about halfway through our evening.  Not sure where she went but I had to go and find her to get some drink refills.  Hate empty glasses!

All in all a nice addition to downtown Hinsdale.  Clearly it&#39;s one of the busiest places in town!"

My wife, who is rather short and has knee and ankle problems, is capable of neither sitting at high tables or going up and down long flights of stairs.   That left two tables for us to sit at downstairs and inside Fuller House.  Luckily one of them was available.  FH does not serve decaf coffee - ever.  This is a major drawback for those of us whose doctor has said, &#34;No more caffeine!&#34;  Our drinking days are long past, so we&#39;re indifferent the selection of beers and other potables.  Also, the noise level is very high, making conversation difficult.   

That being said, my wife enjoyed her Grinder, and the Day and Night burger was well put together and tasty.  The homemade potato ships were very disappointing - the least appetizing homemade chips I&#39;ve tasted. No potato flavor or texture.  FH had tried to zip the up with a little seasoning, but the experience fell short of the mark.  

So...if you&#39;re agile enough to sit at high tables and go up and down stairs, don&#39;t need to avoid caffeine, and like to imbibe, FH is the place for you.  If not, you can find more accomodating restaurants in beautiful HInsdale"

As we sat at the bar... It wasn&#39;t  busy at all around 5:30pm... But the bartenders just ignored me and my boyfriend.

Ok ok so there&#39;s a nice Asian bartender... But unfortunately she was not assigned to us.

Diana was and she was a total b*tch.

Didn&#39;t greet us at all... Just asked what we wanted to drink. Seriously?!!! That&#39;s how you treat customers???
She didn&#39;t greet us... Didn&#39;t ask if we have been there before.... NOTHING...

Granted that we were the only minorities at this place - all Caucasians everywhere ... But damn, we have money girl ... I&#39;m just saying... 

Diana was giving us an attitude ... I ordered wine.. She gave me this small glass filled 1/3... For $13.... No sir

I asked her to give me a beer instead... 

Fast forward an hour later when another girl sat beside me and ordered the same wine, A to Z Pinot noir ... She had 3/4 filled glass... What the f*ck?!!!! 

Thank god I declined the first time...

So since she was really not smiling at all, not giving any indication of &#34;customer service&#34; ... I went to the Yelp app in front of her face... Just making sure she knows I&#39;m on it... 

BEHOLD... All of a sudden, we see some teeth... What?!!! Did I just see her smile?!?! Wow!! Yelp power yeyah!!!!

So we ordered the ff:

Crab dip -- 5 stars

Tomato soup -- 3 stars

Brisket grilled cheese -- 4 stars ( more cheese please )

Day and night burger -- 5 stars

Gotta get some truffle fries -- 5 stars


So yea, food was definitely decent.... But I wish Diana treated everyone the same... She would be smiling to everyone before the customer make eye contact with her... Not fair...

For our bill to be $81... And for us to still give her $16... She is lucky we always give 20% tip or higher .. Diana certainly didn&#39;t deserve it...

Oh btw... The Asian bartender saw us eating our entrees already and she asked if we needed some water... Diana didn&#39;t even bother... That&#39;s how bad it was...

3 stars for ambiance and decent food.

Will we return? Nah"

¬†As we reached there it was fully packed,they also have outdoor seating. We were warmly greeted and seated comfortably near the bar. 

So,lets get started with drinks. I asked my server what would she recommend me and she suggested Blackberry Lemonade and Alagash Draft beer. ¬†
Blackberry Lemonade includes Bulleit Bourbon,fresh lemonade and blackberry. It was served in a Mason jar,totally fascinating. 

We ordered loaded Nachos with chicken(I am a nachos fan really, so no other food stands the chance.) and Buffalo Chicken Wings. Both were appetizing but wings were better out of the two. With a very little space left in stomach,we opted for BBQ chicken pizza. The pizza was average,that&#39;s all I have to say as it was neither really flavorful nor bland. ¬†

I suggest you go at an off time because it is definitely geared to a drinking crowd.  However, we sat upstairs and there were some families up there.  I was shocked that when they rearranged the tables to accommodate a large group, they sat a group of 5 at a table for 2. (The other table that had been with it had been moved to the larger group.  Maybe the hostess thought it was  still a table for 4.  Personally, I would have asked if that was a joke.
We had a couple of appetizers ~ the pretzels and the nachos. The pretzels were outstanding, but we made the mistake of adding chicken to the nachos.  It was processed lunch meat.  The elongated strips of meat did not work with the nachos. I had also ordered a salad which had the same strips.  I do not know if the other meats offered were any better.  Others had the fish tacos and said they were good.
A nice beer selection.
Our berry shortcake was good except for the extremely dried out shortcake.  Nothing that was with it could save it.  It was dry, very dry.
Taking everything into consideration, it was A-OK.
Oh yeah, they only accept reservations for 6 or more."

Went on a Sunday evening for dinner. I was immediately impressed with their decor, it is impeccable! The two staircase, exposed brick, lighting.... It&#39;s a 5 in my books for looks. The food.. Well at least my food was not impressive. I ordered the brisket grilled cheese and the animal fries. Can I just tell you, the animal fries are amazing! When my dish arrived my sandwich was hot but my fries were cold, so cold that I thought about sending them back, but I took one bite and I was in heaven. I can only imagine how much yummier they taste hot, with the cheese actually melted, my cheese was not melted and it was a big unmelted square on top of my fries. Those fries, yum! Now my sandwich was not as good, it was dry and flavorless. The brisket was minimal and had no flavor. I only ate one half of the sandwich and brought the other half home, it was not eaten. To drink I had their white sangria which was ok. I&#39;m used to sangria being served with fruit, this had none. I&#39;m not into whiskey and most of their cocktails had whiskey in them. 
Our server, Zack, was very friendly and very honest in giving us opinions about certain dishes, he was also attentive without being overbearing. I would have liked for him to come check on us after our food came out since I would have pointed out the cold fries. 
I think I will return since it&#39;s a cute place, close to home and a great place to watch a game since they have giant tvs all around. I will for sure be back for those animal fries!"

I went on a Saturday afternoon since it was literally 55-60 degrees out in December and had to take advantage of our beautiful weather.

The hostess sat us within minutes of entering and shortly greeted by our server with the most addictive smile (Megan). The menu is straight forward and so is their drink list. We went for the Moscow Mule (hold the bitters) and a pint of Allagash White. For starters we chose the Buffalo Shrimp appetizer with crumbled blue cheese and ranch dressing. Seriously freakin&#39; fantastic and just the right amount of spicy kick to keep my anticipation on hold before the main meal.

Next followed the brick oven Margherita Pizza with fresh mozzarella, basil, garlic, tomato sauce and extra virgin olive oil. We had an additional topping of carmalized onions too because that is the way we roll! Just the right amount of crisp and I am a total crust person so I enjoyed every bite. We also ordered their handheld Buffalo Fried Chicken sandwich tossed in buffalo sauce. That sucker was HUGE! Very filling and although the menu indicated served on a pretzel bun it came on a brioche bun. No complaints it was tasty and held up well. I did upgrade the hand cut fries to be served &#34;Animal Style&#34;. A delightlful formula of thousand island dressing, carmalized onions and cheese. The cheese could have been melted a tad more (it was only half melted) but still delicious!

A good beer selection with some good, local choices.  We started with the nachos and added pulled pork - REALLY good.  Usually nachos are just nachos, but these chips were particularly good.  We all had a bowl of their soup - pasta faggiole.  Very hearty and flavorful, which was great on a chilly day.  My shrimp po&#39; boy sandwich was really good, and I enjoyed the truffle fries that I upgraded to.  Serving sizes were generous and packed with flavor.  Everyone in our party really enjoyed their meals - the burgers looked huge!  I would definitely recommend, and return the next time thru town."

Very clean and cool industrial decor. Smaller outside patio area but great on a nice day. We started with the soft pretzel, which was HUGE and delicious (especially the cheese and mustard dipping sauces). I would recommend it with a large group. Great alcohol selection,  especially whiskey and beer. Very friendly and knowledgeable staff. The brisket mac and cheese and briskett grilled cheese is mouthwatering just looking at/smelling it. Delicious and hearty salads. Great place to watch a sports game, weather you stay for a meal or just have a few drinks."

I&#39;ve had a couple of people tell me about Fuller house and I finally got to experience it. I met a few of my friends there for GNO and we pretty much ordered the whole menu. Started out with Nachos for the table. Also got their virgin blackberry lemonade and  strawberry basil drinks, they were so refreshing. Then we ordered the West Coast (double 1/4 lb steak burger patties, animal sauce, caramelized onions, pickle chips, american cheese, lettuce, tomato), Red Devil (roasted jalape√±os, smashed avocado, pepper jack, habanero mayo - spiciest burger I&#39;ve ever had), southwest salad (fried chicken, romaine + iceberg mix, tomatoes, avocado, roasted corn, black beans, cheddar, southwest ranch), Grilled shrimp tacos, Caprese handheld with animal fries, and salmon la puebla salad. For dessert we ordered the chocolate mousse cheesecake. Everything was delicious, I don&#39;t think we had one thing we disliked. It&#39;s a perfect place to watch the game with big screen TVs everywhere and great food. I wish our waitress hadn&#39;t disappeared on us for while and then messed up our checks but I think it&#39;s because it was a busy night. I will be going back there more often to watch football and have some more of those nachos!"

So much so, that I&#39;ll dedicate review # 700 to you, Fuller House. When a friend saw my pics on Facebook of FH, he said sooo how was that place? I couldn&#39;t stop gushing about it and I think he was sorry he ever asked.

Fuller House has every part of dining that I love: great service, a solid beer list, crafted cocktails and dynamite food. The ambiance and decor is also chill. If you love brisket, then run--don&#39;t walk-- to Fuller House. (Side note, a run is a good idea. You&#39;ll probably need a good cardio workout if you indulge in everything that you want to try.) There&#39;s brisket nachos, brisket chili, brisket fries, etc etc. 

We tried the brisket nachos, which was one of my favorite items of the night. The chips are homemade and there&#39;s enough toppings to ensure that every chip is covered. We also started with the cheese curds, which were pretty good but I preferred the nachos. Trip # 2 will require a sampling of the buffalo shrimp, but I feared ordering those because I wouldn&#39;t want to share with anyone else at the table.

For dinner, I ordered the fish tacos with a side of animal style fries. If you&#39;re one of the ones bummed we don&#39;t have an In N Out here, I recommend ordering the animal style fries. (They also have a West Coast burger, inspired by the great West Coast chain.) The fries were great and even with so many toppings, they weren&#39;t soggy. The fish tacos were pretty good, although I ended up bringing them home and eating them warmed up so I&#39;ll come back soon to try them fresh. Ericka and I also split the triple mac &amp; cheese. It was also very tasty.

For drinks, I ordered the Vandermill Blueberry Cider. I also went with the Hinsdale Mule, which is similar to the Moscow version but with orange bitters. It was so refreshing on a hot summer night. The drinks are average prices and a cocktail off the menu will cost you $9. 

Our server was Brian and he was excellent at making recommendations and letting us know about all the current specials. Our food was spaced out accordingly and we were never rushed or hurried. 

I already have a second trip planned to come back and I&#39;ve told pretty much everyone I know to check them out. Fuller House is one of my new favorite spots."

Fuller House has become a regular &#34;go-to&#34; spot for my friends, family and I. Your trip is not complete unless you order their Blackberry Bourbon Lemonade cocktail and their buffalo shrimp (in the small bites section). With that being said, I&#39;ve tried a good amount of items off their menu and usually have a hard time picking what I want to eat because everything I&#39;ve tried is SO delicious. The atmosphere is very lively and the decor is beautiful - make sure you check upstairs for the awesome American flag and the women&#39;s restroom!

Buffalo Shrimp
Fried Buffalo Chicken Sandwich

I&#39;ve been here on a Saturday night, a weekday for lunch and a weekday night and every time this place is hopping!  Can&#39;t believe this was the hardware store my mom used to send me to for hoover vacuum cleaner bags!

Their pizzas are great, kudos to the oven for cranking these out.  My fav is the prosciutto and arugula.  I&#39;ve also had their calamari, fried pickles and truffle fries.  Their brisket grilled cheese is decadent as are desserts.

Great beer choices, great bourbon selection (husband thanks you for this) and some fun and unique cocktails too.

I had asked the waitress on a whim if they had my favorite beer and they did not. (No big deal) then a few minutes later the manager came out with a bottle that he said he kept in the back.

The thing about bars and restaurants, especially with current trends is a lot of them over promise and under deliver. Although this restaurant is new, if they continue with the consistency in service, food quality and beer selection then I don&#39;t really see too many flaws. For starters I would like to compliment the chefs and cooks on the house made pretzels, although simple to craft in theory, these are probably quite laborious  to make and hats off that they are served with three house made dipping sauces and both of the cheeses are made to order for as little as 7$. The only suggestion I could make to my meal, is that on the west coast burger, the burger to bun ratio should be more around 5-6 ounces , even with two patties or possibly toss it in a bun with more density and ditch some lettuce. Ultimately though, this is a cozy type of place that you could meet a couple for a drink at or swing by to watch a game at with the guys. The best pubs and bars don&#39;t overcomplicate their menu and execute those simple crowd favorites with consistency, so if Fuller House continues like this then I will be back every week!"

I think we were dining around 7:30/8:00 pm, and service lagged a bit. We had a pretzel for an appetizer and all had sandwiches for dinner. I upgraded my fries to the truffle option, and they were delicious! I would go back if in the area, just during a slower window."

We had to wait a while for a table but once we sat down we were overall pretty happy. Cool atmosphere and music, pretty broad menu, and prices are reasonable. The food was overall good, but the salads were a bit sad. Just lettuce and meat in a deep bowl. They need to work on those a bit. Tons of fun drink options. We tried the manhattans, old fashioned, and a tequila drink with strawberry and basil. All were tasty. We also had a cookie skillet dessert that was good. We will probably wait a bit to go back, till some of the buzz dies down."

The food, which I describe as gourmet bar food, is excellent. The burgers, animal fries, and brisket grilled cheese are particularly good. 

Good beer selection, even better bourbon selection. We have had great service each time we&#39;ve dined here. The space is cool and there is a lot of energy in the place. Two of the largest tv screens in the area make it a good place to catch a Hawks game."

We started out with a round of bloody Mary&#39;s, which were subpar to say the least. With a $12 price tag I expected a lot more out of them. For an underwhelming garish of olives, lemon and lime wedges they were exceptionally pickley. As for the Tito&#39;s vodka I paid for I was hoping to at least taste it..

The cheese curds were to die for; they came with an interesting chipotle ranch but we opted for marinara instead. I ordered the wedge salad, it had a tasty but barely there blue cheese dressing.  If I didn&#39;t ask for extra ($.50), I would not have had enough for the two massive wedges of iceberg lettuce with brown centers.. My friend ordered the brisket tacos with truffle fries which were too greasy for my liking.

Our server was nice yet seem a little preoccupied with other tables as our waters were left empty and our finished appetizer left on the table for quite some time.

I cannot wait to give this place another chance in the near future as it is a lovely and lively bar/restaurant with plenty of other options on the menu to try."

So-so food, a wait staff that is overwhelmed and clientele who think they&#39;re the only person that matters in the entire place. That being said I had a good time until we ordered the chocolate chip cookie skillet to finish our meal. My sister-in-law took one bite and immediately had to spit it out due to the fact that she has a very severe peanut allergy. The menu doesn&#39;t mention anything about peanuts being in the dessert and not a single person in the entire place could tell us whether or not it actually had nuts in it until the cook came out and said it in fact did have peanuts.

When we mentioned that was a problem to the manager (possibly owner) and could potentially harm or kill someone in the future, she seemed less than receptive to our recommendations. She told us it was our responsibility to tell the server about any special food allergies... not exactly the reaction I was hoping for.

At the end of the night when we received our bill there were drinks on the bill that had not been delivered to the table the first time we ordered, so had to be reordered and we were charged twice for them. After a long discussion with the manager (possibly owner) of the establishment she refused to take the drinks off of the bill and told us they weren&#39;t in the business of giving things away for free. Needless to say we will NEVER step foot in this place again and I would warn anyone going there to make sure every drink you order actually shows up at the table and that if you do have anyone in your group with one of those &#34;special&#34; food allergies to make sure and talk to the cook directly about what they are puttng in the food.

DINE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!"

The buffalo wings were perfectly crispy and saucy. My shrimp po boy was perfect- I wouldn&#39;t change a thing.

Definitely a little lite for two but just right for our sweet tooth. We were there pretty early and it filled up fast. I can see there could easily be a wait on the weekend or a sport night. A little noisy but you could easily carry on a conversation upstairs where we were. Our server was very attentive and had a great personality. TVs in every direction.

While the food may be acceptable this is not a place you may want to go if you want a quiet meal. To start it is small and cramped. If a patron does not get a seat at the bar it is very likely they will be standing next to your table and you will have a rump in your face. Also it is not a place I would recommend for a night out with friends. This is not a place to spend the night having cocktails. They charge downtown prices for drinks and my pour was so short that I was insulted. I made the mistake of going there twice, having forgot my first experience. Honestly, even if they offered me a free meal and a drink after reading this review I would have to decline."

Totally worth it and they are super delicious (a little on the greasy side for some people but it&#39;s Fries people)

I settled on the Boston Filler which is gyros,along w/ a chopped up italian sausage in a 9&#34; chunk of french bread with onions, &amp; choice of gyros sauce or cheese. It was fantastic! And so were the fries. And I came because they have  green river on tap which I dont find often and love. This is a divey place but reminds me of my divey place in Plainfield - Smileys.

 When you walk in, and that gyro is broiled to perfection ---
It&#39;s sold. To the person ahead of you, or to the phone order.

After a few amazing gyros, I got hooked on this place. Started going often.
2 out of 3 times - raw meat, heated on a fryer, 
JUST ahead of the guy or gal that got the good stuff.
Sometimes diced instead of strips, but the sauce always rules..

Except for the Last Time, I got the rind.

The place hasn&#39;t been updated in years, but the menu is expansive and everything I&#39;ve ever tried has been amazing.

This is one of those places that are ubiquitous in Chicago, but I think they do a much better job. You can get all the usual suspects here: hot dogs, hamburgers, beef sandwiches, gyros, but then they go above and beyond. They have about ten different types of potatoes: french fries, cajun fries, tator tots, etc. Try the feta cheese on the tator tots!

Also, they have a wide variety of sandwiches and salads that you wont find at any other hot dog places. A couple of examples are fried fish and shrimp, wraps, cold sub sandwiches, bbq rib sandwich (this rib sandwich is there year round and I think better than the one at a certain fast food restaurant), cuban sandwich and monte cristos to name a few.

The best part is that the food is reasonably priced and you&#39;re always surprised by how much you get. 

They also have specials every day."

Lots of platters that come with fries, but I thought the Greek Fries that came with the Gyros Platter was just like steak fries with seasoning. The Gyros was good! The meatball sandwich was ok, not much flavor! The regular fries was salted too much! The tater tots was like regular tots nothing fancy with that. The dining area is small, so come with a few friends to eat, not many people unless you want to stand. It&#39;s a typical fast food place to get your gyros, hot dogs, and burgers. Not bad for the prices. I will come here again and try the Italian Sausage. They even have ice cream here! No complaints here!"

The driver forgot to come with the credit card machine that was suppose to be with him per my conversation with the man that took my order. I then attempted to pay by phone by calling 10x and the line was busy so I called the driver. He contacted a co worker who said the phone was off the hook. All in all it took about 30-40 minutes to actually get my food and the place is only 6 minutes away. I was even more upset because no one apologized or even acknowledge the inconvenience. The lady that ended up taking my card information even had the nerve to ask was I adding a tip.

Was my favorite place growing up so when I moved back to the area of course had to get a delivery order. Forward two months and I tried to place a delivery order last night and was informed on the phone it would be over an hour, not ideal but okay for sure, I told him that was fine. He starts to take my address and when he heard Downers Grove got very rude and said that was out of their delivery zone. Funny considering I&#39;ve ordered delivery here before and we are only 2.4 miles away, I checked. He said they could still do it but it would be &#34;well over an hour&#34; I had already said an hour was fine and I didn&#39;t appreciate the attitude like he was annoyed by our residence. I decided not to order because of it and asked to speak to a manager. The manager offered to buy our food and personally bring it to us, which would have been a nice offer, had he not insulted me. He gave me attitude and stated that he had asked the employee if he was rude on the phone and the employee said no and that he hadn&#39;t had a complaint on him in three years so it was my fault. He also told me I was condescending because I politely declined his offer after all that had happened. Sad that a place I&#39;ve loved so much for so long believes that&#39;s customer service.

This is exactly what you would expect.  The menu covers one wall over the counter ~ how could you not possibly find something to stimulate those taste buds?

Yes, with only the dog to share the bed, I selected the gyros.  I had not had one in years.  It was plenty for me to share with said dog and not have to worry about cooking anything for dinner.

I mean, really, the bag still smelled like gyros an hour after I had been home.  Can heartburn be far behind?  And TOTALLY worth it :)

I&#39;ve experienced Doggie Diner a couple times in a variety of forms as someone working  and living in the area:

Hole-in-the-wall happiness:
Located within a suburban strip mall with not an entirely appetizing name, it&#39;s def more of a place the locals visit. Dining area is divey yet cozy with basic tables and chairs, sports memorabilia and TVs in the corners. Counter for placing orders is super high, but still allows customer to converse with cashier and cook.

Short and sweet service:
Quick and friendly with both delivery and carry-out. Even though I tend to have a lot of specifications (ie. dressings on the side, subbing out items, questions about specials for the day), employees are understanding and willing to accommodate.

Greasy goodness -
It&#39;s the kind of food to either have the morning after a late night-out  or the kind of place to go for a quick bite. I&#39;ve gotten a variety of items in the past such as the gyro, Greek salad and tots. 

Portions will always be ginormous. For instance, one time I thought was getting a small side for my tator tots + feta but it turned out to be a basket. And another time, my gyro was bursting with meat.

However, size doesn&#39;t always matter ... when it comes to food, of course.

Tater tots were crisp on the outside, soft on the inside - just like how I prefer my fries and tots. The feta was a unique salty/creamy complement, but the dish would be even better if there was a bit more seasoning to kick up the flavor component. I ended up dousing mine with tangy ketchup and sprinkling ground black pepper.

As for the gyro meat, it isn&#39;t the most juicy/tender or flavorful that I&#39;ve had.

The Greek salad is actually one of my go-tos because of the surprisingly fresh ingredients - bright romaine instead of iceberg, which I truly appreciate, as well as crisp slices of cucumber, thinly sliced white onion, plump black olives and more chunks of feta. The vinaigrette is light and added the right acidity.

Loyal on local -
For fast food, I&#39;d prefer Doggie Diner any day compared to the nearby national chains in the area so I will continue to patronize this joint when in a pinch or in need of some sustenance post-all-nighter."

Their Chicago Dog was pretty standard fare.  The real winner was the Francheezie Dog with Bacon.  It was a hot dog filled with cheese and wrapped in bacon.  Definitely a must try if you&#39;re looking for a good dog.  They also have plenty of other standard diner options.  One of my friends enjoyed the Philly cheesesteak dog.

So what if it&#39;s in a generic strip mall next to the insurance guy...you probably should get insurance so you have an excuse to walk in here at least once a month (and then sign up for a gym membership down the street at Edwards).

I grew up on Doggie Diner as a Woodridge/Downers Grove native and I rarely get to go back and visit the original Woodridge location, but it&#39;s pretty much exactly the same as I left it. There&#39;s some fresh paint, a small flat screen TV for Cubs&#39; games, and some new menu offerings but everything&#39;s the same--I can still barely see over the counter since I&#39;m short, the guy taking the order is the same dude (he hasn&#39;t even aged a bit, I swear)

I talk about this place every time I&#39;m have a gyro craving. Don&#39;t even get me started on their Greek Fries -- Ohhhhh MMMMM Geeee! I&#39;ve had these at several places in the city and nothing, I mean nothing, compares! The Greek Fries at Doggie Diner have the perfect crunch and crispiness and they don&#39;t make it soggy by using red vinegar.

Their tziki sauce is crazy good. Their gyro meat which I&#39;m sure isn&#39;t unique to many places just tastes better for some reason. (And they gook their meat crispy mmmmm)."

There&#39;s a really good Filipino/Asian grocery store in that strip but that&#39;s for another review.

Ordered the gyro platter, which had extra meat and Greek fries. Everything on the gyro. Everyone was friendly and didn&#39;t have to wait too long even though there were a few others waiting for orders in front of me. The other reviewers are not exaggerating when they say it&#39;s enough meat (and toppings) for two gyros. I was nearly full from just the fries and toppings before I was able to pick the thing up to eat it. Very delicious, meat wasn&#39;t too salty, tzatziki was tasty, then couple huge feta cheese blocks on top was a bonus.

I lived in Woodridge for almost a year before trying this place due to the fact I thought they made fancy food for dogs. Seriously. The name threw me off. I think those places exist, right? Well the bf brought be home a hot dog and some feta fries from here one hangover Sunday afternoon. The tasteless hot dog was a shade of white I have never seen before and the fries were so soggy they were almost inedible even with a fork. They had a vinegary taste too. Yuck. I will eat almost anything greasy whilst hungover and I couldn&#39;t even finish them.

Upon walking in you&#39;ll notice there&#39;s two doors with a slight divide between them. The door on the right leads to the counter where the menu board is posted and you can place your order. The door on the left is there for patrons to leave and to confuse people who&#39;ve never visited before. There are a handful of tables inside and a counter with stools right near the menu board where you order your food.

When I arrived at Doggie Diner I was fairly hungry and decided to try a few different menu items. Let&#39;s first start with the hot dog.

The hot dog came on a regular non-poppy seed bun. The bun tasted fresh and was soft with no signs of dryness. In ordering the hot dog I was told that celery salt and peppers are not included by default and that they&#39;re optional, I decided to go for both. It was once I received my hot dog that I discovered why this particular hot dog joint has these as optional items. The sport peppers used are of the very very hot variety and I&#39;d recommend passing on them if you plan to eat a hot dog here. The celery salt was applied fairly liberally and almost entirely on the pickle. The pickle was perhaps the biggest downfall of this dog, it&#39;s wider than the hot dog and nearly as thick. On my first bite I tasted far more pickle than any other ingredient and this is quite an accomplishment considering how hot the sport peppers were. There seemed to be a bit too much mustard, but the onions and relish were applied well. I&#39;d rate this a two star hot dog at best.

Fortunately for Doggie Diner I also decided to try a cheeseburger and tater tots. The burger I received was a juicy well grilled delight. The cheese was an excellent compliment, strangely enough like the hot dog the pickles on the burger were too thick as well. Fortunately, this was the only negative thing I had to say about the burger.

I also tried the tater tots, I was surprised by the amount they gave me as it was an entire basket of them, I only finished around a quarter of them while in the restaurant and got a bag to take the rest home. They were crispy on the outside with a nice inside. I&#39;d recommend them.

Overall Doggie Diner seems like a good enough place to pick up fast food, however I wouldn&#39;t recommend their hot dog. The pickle taste overpowered the rest of the dog. Based on the tater tots, quality burger and fact that they serve green river I&#39;m giving the restaurant an overall 3 stars. I&#39;d come back again, just not for the hot dog."

I mostly come here for the nostalgic feeling, although the food is still pretty good even though I am not really a big hot dog person anymore.

The only place I can think of that has better hot dogs than Doggie Diner is Portillo&#39;s. I like that they serve RC Cola here. Even though I prefer Coke and Pepsi, I like to have RC every once in awhile, so I think its awesome that they have it here. 

Doggie Diner has very reasonable prices and they give you a lot of fries, so I still enjoy eating here from time to time."

One of my pet peeves about any restaurant is the temperature of the dining area.  I know most lower the heat over night to save a buck, but at three in the afternoon, it should be at least warm.  During my visit, it was so cold that my food got cold within minutes of getting it and that my backside was freezing.

Now the bad things on the food.
1) $1.79 for a liter if RC, maybe Coke or Pepsi.
2) No poppy seed bun.
3) Run of the mill french fries.
4) Pickle way too big and too cold for the dog.
5) Too much liquid ingredients, bun got soggy.
6) No tray to bring food to table, had to make several trips to counter.
7) Way too much salt on the fries.
8) Order was wrong, had to get it corrected.

Needless to say this will not make as one of my favorite places to get a good hot dog."

Wolverine and Sabertooth.  Doggie Diner&#39;s Fries and my dieting aspirations. Bitter arch enemies to the end, I&#39;m afraid.

I&#39;ve been dipping into Doggie Diner for these oh-so-delicious fries ever since I was kid. A family friend lives within walking distance of this place, so whenever we&#39;d visit her, it was fifteen minutes behind the church, over the creek, and into the diner&#39;s cute establishment. 

All the food is great here: I&#39;ve had gyros, hot dogs, and burgers, but their deliciously greasy bag of fries is what keeps me coming back They&#39;re lightly seasoned with what tastes like garlic (not entirely sure) and there is always enough for sharing. If you&#39;re looking for a place with great American junk food, Doggie Diner is the place for you.

The place is decorated in typical diner fare: neon signs and sports memorabilia. There are booths and a table or two, so you can round up a group of friends to hang out. The atmosphere is pretty laid back: the guys and gals behind the counter are the usual high school/ college crowd, so talking to them while the food is cooking is always fun."

Doggie Diner has been around for decades--and they even have more locations now!  It&#39;s THE local place for cheap eats (especially if you&#39;re in a bind where you screw up cooking dinner), and it&#39;s pretty quick service considering how busy they can be.  There&#39;s almost always a line, and they&#39;re always taking phone orders, and they even deliver!

Cons: Grease.  You want fries to go?  Perhaps a gyros sandwich?  Better apply Scotch Guard to your car&#39;s upholstry, because the bags will be soaked in grease.  Anyone who&#39;s eaten here knows what I&#39;m talking about.  The dining room isn&#39;t much to boast about, either.

The food&#39;s okay, but it&#39;s not great.  But is that the point?  I mean, c&#39;mon - everyone&#39;s got a favorite here.  It&#39;s not totally about the food but about enjoying the summer air with a hot dog, fries, and a shake.  Get back to work on your diet in the morning."

Now, I love Gene &amp; Jude&#39;s, Portillo&#39;s, Buona Beef.  This place is equally priced but dreadfully lower grade.  And my wife and I both paid the price the next day, if you know what I mean.  
Skip this place, grab Jewel&#39;s chicken wings (fantastic) or drive a little further to Portillo&#39;s if you crave a hot dog or combo.  If you crave a gyro, try the mexican version of a gyro...Al Pastor tacos.  Same concept of meat on a stick sliced and placed on a corn tortilla.  Easier to find and usually better than most gyros."

We always do take out, and they are really fast for the amount of food we order.  The people are really nice.  I always ask for the fries to be extra crispy, and they always do it.  Also, when you get fries to go you get one of those paper lunch bags of fries.  It is an insane amount of fires!  

They do serve beer here.  However, it is socially unacceptable to have lunch beers at my place of employment, so I go with some yummy Green River!

Yeah, it is greasy. Yeah, it is unhealthy.

But where else can you find RC Cola and Green River?

Where else do they serve gyros piled so high that you have to eat them with a fork first? And the Tzatziki/cucumber sauce that goes with it is perfect. So many places screw up this ordinary gyro condiment.

Chicken sandwiches here are so basic, but it is that combination of fried chicken pattie, the right amount of mayo, and chopped iceberg lettuce that fulfills some craving

I like their chili, I eat their clam chowder, and I&#39;ve tried lots of other stuff. This place never lets me down, ever."

The first time I went, I intended to order the gyros &#34;plate,&#34; but the guy misheard me and I got the platter. It was a very happy mistake! For an extra 20 cents, the platter comes with Greek fries and two squares of concentrated deliciousness (which is to say, feta). I never even knew I liked feta! I&#39;ve never been to a restaurant that just hands out hunks of the stuff, especially not for what amounts to less than 10 cents apiece! 

The portion size is AMAZING, given their quite-reasonable prices. I can eat off this $8 meal for an entire day. I keep going back with the intent to try something new, but visions of feta and more meat than even 2 pitas could possibly contain bring me back to the gyros platter every time. I like to hold a square of feta in one hand and take little bites as I eat the &#34;overflow&#34; strips of gyro meat, until the pita is light enough to actually be picked up and consumed (don&#39;t worry, I get it to-go so nobody else has to see this... trust me though, it&#39;s a lot of fun!)

Maybe one day I&#39;ll get sick of the gyros and try something else. But don&#39;t count on it! Not anytime soon, at least. I&#39;m about to go pick up platter #4. 

The only thing I didn&#39;t like about Doggie Diner was the smart-aleck sign about how ketchup isn&#39;t allowed. Well, I&#39;m not a Chicago native. I wouldn&#39;t put ketchup on a Chicago dog, of course, but I still like ketchup on my fries. I can&#39;t remove a star for that, since I know most people would probably think it was cool. Still, little kids like ketchup on everything. I think it&#39;d be nice if they kept a bottle around for the customers who want it."

The sauce is good, the pita is good, and the meat is good, all of which collectively complete the high quality delicious gyro trifecta.  The fries are also good, very similar to WacArnold&#39;s, which probably explains why people like them so much.  The large fries is LARGE.  I have also had the cajun fries which are basically Arby&#39;s curly fries, but they are not that great and the portions are MUCH smaller then the regular fries AND they are more expensive.

RBK is a sleek and cozy spot right in the heart of Downers Grove. They feature fresh, quality food at slightly elevated prices but I&#39;d say it&#39;s worth it.

We started with the totchos, crispy sweet potato nuggets with pulled pork, salsa, cheese and sour cream. It was a small but nicely sized portion and very tasty. I also had a cocktail from their nicely done list, a riff on an old fashioned with vanilla bourbon and brandied cherries.

My husband ordered the Nashville hot chicken, and I went with the short ribs. The chicken was perfectly crispy and nicely spicy. The short ribs were extremely tender and melted in my mouth.

Service was good. The seating was a teeny bit awkward with a small half wall separating me from the face of the woman at the next table, but we ignored it for the most part. 

Overall it was a great experience and we&#39;ll happily add RBK to our nice dinner repertoire."

We didn&#39;t have a reservation on a Friday night, but it was still early enough and it was nice out so we just sat outside for about 15 minutes, then a spot opened at the bar so we headed inside for a couple of cocktails. I tried the watermelon mickey and my wife had the stormy morning. Both were tasty and made with good quality liquor. Crystal was super friendly and helpful at the bar, and gave us recommendations for dinner.

We didn&#39;t feel unwelcome. The hostess (owner?) visited us at the bar several times, letting us know how long the wait would be, asked if we wanted to just eat there, and then offered to prolong our seating time because we seemed to be enjoying ourselves (we were). 

After being seated at our table, I ordered a caesar salad and the braised short rib. My wife went with the lobster roll. Everything came out incredibly quickly for how busy they were. And everything tasted good. The prices were fair and the service was completely on point. It wasn&#39;t the best food we&#39;ve ever eaten, but it was definitely up there in quality, texture and taste. 

We will absolutely return for another meal some time in the future. I look forward to trying some of the other tempting items on the menu as well as sample a few of the cocktails."

Wasn&#39;t expecting too much, just another suburban &#34;trendy-spot&#34; wannabe.  We&#39;ve seen dozens like that come &amp; go.  I mean, it&#39;s a long way from north Halsted or Randolph Street,  Mixed reviews confirmed that this was gonna be another disappointment.

But the steak was excellent.  I had a 28-day, dry-aged, 14-oz NY Strip, and wow!  They&#39;re no Ruth Chris, nor even a Capital Grille, but they knock the socks off of Gordon Biersch (a good, local, no-frills steak place).  My wife&#39;s Sea Bass was equally impressive, but in a more subtle way.  Not many, but great wine-by-the-glass selections.  And the flourless chocolate cake could even compare with Logan Square in quality (though offering it with raspberry sauce would have been so much better).

We skipped appetizers, though several looked tempting enough to bring me back again soon.  Short rib sliders and Maryland crab cakes will definitely be calling my name.  The service was friendly, though lacking in attentiveness and polish.  Disappointing (though not enough to dissuade me from returning) was the fact that they didn&#39;t have cappuccino.  And the prices are a little higher then I&#39;d expect (especially from a place that don&#39;t serve cappuccino).  Coffee was just so-so.

Overall, local and convenient enough for me to want to add it as a &#34;regular.&#34;"

The staff was very accommodating with splitting the bill between all the various couples and another party who was paying a portion beforehand for us.  The appetizers were quite good, my favorite of all was the asparagus dish.  We had the salmon and eggplant Parmesan, and found both to be quite delicious and appropriate portions for the price.  The flourless chocolate cake was amazing.  I was actually sad to see how small the portion size was because it was SO GOOD!  Definitely don&#39;t order this dessert to split, keep it for yourself!"

Weird that the owners really keep to their selves and are a little uppity.  For a place this small it would be nice if the owners walked around to make sure customers were happy.

We went on a Friday night with no reservations, we walked in to a few open tables but was told by the befuddled hostess it would be 20 min we were shown to a nice place to sit and we looked at the menu. The hostess sat the people that walked in behind us then sat us immediately. why I call her befuddled, is because it seamed like a competent hostess would have been able to handle two parties walking in at the same time and figure out how to seat them accordingly. Again not a huge deal but if they want to be good something to address. 

Our table was comfortable but our waitress was MIA. WE waited  a few minutes before anyone said anything  all the while our friend the hostess just watched us be obviously thirsty. It&#39;s a small place so the waitress not making eye contact with us until she was ready to deal with us was a little uncomfortable.  When we finally got some attention things were better, we had drinks. Disco lemonade was underwhelming the Cosmo was well made.  We ordered the goat cheese appetizer, it was great. Neat way to do a simple dish. 

When ordering our main dishes I was a little taken back by how I was helped with the menu. I like to use a server as a resource in a good restaurant, so I asked about 3 dishes, pork chop, the short rib or the fried chicken.  I was told the pork chop takes 25 minutes and the short rib was like 20, so if I didn&#39;t want to wait forever have the chicken it&#39;s good. 
I went with the chicken( because I love fried chicken but I&#39;m also a pork chop guy). My gripe here is if you have things that take a long time you need to tell people when the order app&#39;s so the time me is not an issue, I&#39;m sure the chef doesn&#39;t want that to be part of the menu,,,,time of prep.

The chicken was 2/5 not allot of flavor,,,,crust too hard. The flesh of the chicken had a funny flavor and texture. It was dry and best I could figure it was &#34;burnt&#34; in a brine or marinade. 
Slaw was inedible , I&#39;m not a big slaw guy but this is a bad representation of any kind of slaw. 
Mashed potatoes were excellent. 

Wife had the lobster roll. 3/5 seemed fresh but nothing special,,,, fries were great. 

Weakest part of the meal was the banana cream pie.
The pudding seemed home made but the crust tasted pre made. 

My suggestion is to keep refining your menu and execution and train your FOH &#39;s a little better."

This is a great place for adults, though. The shrimp tacos were great, and the appetizer menu had quite a variety. My husband tried a cocktail, which was a little weak, but it was a pretty early dinner, so perhaps that is expected. Our server was very friendly and respectful of the kids (their food came fast, and she brought their drinks in kid cups, offered booster seats).  My husband and I will be back, but we&#39;ll get a babysitter next time."

They are cute lights strung up and comfortable outdoor chairs.  What a great spot to sit with a glass of wine and some food in downtown DG to people watch and enjoy the weather. I love their wine list - unique wines you won&#39;t see at every other restaurant in the suburbs without the list being too &#34;out there&#34;.  I always try something new and haven&#39;t been disappointed!  Food is excellent, too.  Innovative takes on American classics using fresh, high quality ingredients.  Happy to have RBK as an addition to downtown DG - it needed something like this!"
rbk-american-grill-downers-grove,Mark C.,7CMgE_je6s2b4Pu9eY1rCw,"Chicago, IL",0,1,0,2,18,TJ9aHU224knVXFHuwZLGzw,5.0,2015-09-04,"A burger on par or perhaps better than Au Cheval?  Indeed....

I&#39;m going to come right out and say that this is the best restaurant in Downers Grove.  Parker&#39;s is a top tier restaurant, but is a bit formal and high end for most diners to go on a regular basis (their bar however is fantastic). Capri is also exceptional, but Italian food isn&#39;t very diverse. 

My wife and I eat out a lot, both here in the Western suburbs as well as downtown Chicago.  Finding suburban (non chain) restaurants that rival Chicago ones is always a challenge.  I think RBK stands as a &#34;City worthy&#34; restaurant within a mediocre dining scene in downtown Downers (too many average pubs and pizza joints).  

Inside is tastefully decorated, clean and modern.  Service was polite and quick, no concerns.  Now on to the food:  we started with some cocktails, I had a cherry bourbon manhattan and my wife had the berry vodka cocktail.  Both were nice and strong and well crafted.  They also had some great wines and craft beers that we drank during dinner.  We had 3 appetizers, the PEI mussels in broth, which were tasty and made for great bread dipping.  However the other 2 appetizers were our favorites, the tempura asparagus (incredible) and the goat cheese balls with crostinis and sauce (again, amazing). We could of easily forgone dinner and ordered another round of those. 

For dinner I opted for the Pierce burger, and my wife ordered the shrimp tacos. She loved her tacos (3 large softshell with fried shrimp) however she would prefer a grilled shrimp option.  Now on to my burger.  Let me preface this by stating I love burgers, and eat a lot of them around Chicagoland.  Until RBK, Au Cheval on Randolph was the king of burgers (followed by Kuma&#39;s and a few others).  The pierce burger is absolutely in my top 3.  Incredible flavor and texture, cooked absolutely perfect (which seems to be a lost art these days) and topped with grilled onions and a stupid good dijonaisse.  Served with a mountain of top notch handcut fries.  It was one of those meals that you almost started laughing at how ridiculously good it is.  

We topped off dinner with the banana creme pie, which was lighter than I expected and very tasty and balanced with an oreo crust.  Unfortunately, the restaurant does not have an espresso machine...hopefully they can add one to the kitchen. 

I don&#39;t post a lot of restaurant reviews in general, but this place deserves everyone&#39;s attention.  It is so good that I am taking the time to write this up and spread the word.  Downers Grove hasn&#39;t had the best track record with dining, but I think all of this is changing in the right direction.  Again, get over to RBK and have a fantastic meal."

Mom had the tuna tartare appetizer and it was good. I had the prime steak and it was only okay. Not a great cut of meat, and the first time I&#39;ve ever had a steak served pre-cut into strips for me!

No soft surfaces to reduce sound, so even only half full it was quite noisy.

Food was excellent as was our attentive server Alex. 
We shared mussels. Very fresh (always a risk ordering mussels as they go bad FAST), and a tasty butter sauce. Plenty for two. We both had the Scallop special. Very nice. 
Saw others ordering the burgers, which other post rave about. Burgers are waste of this place skills if you ask me. 
One observation, Alex our waiter was self serving some of the bar orders. Didn&#39;t seem to cramp his style, but if biz gets faster, the bartender better get faster. IMO 
Definitely 5 star suburbs. On par with other favs like Antico Posto.

There were only 6 to choose from and none were seasonal. We ordered the goat cheese appetizer which was amazing!! However, all appetizers come in portions of 3 which makes no sense. I ordered the short ribs with horseradish mashed potatoes.  The short ribs were fine - though not very flavorful. They tasted more like pot roast, however very tender. The mashed potatoes were also a dissapointment. I did not taste any horseradish. They tasted like plain mashed potatoes.

Regarding cocktails, the Lost Dutchman was a tasty Manhattan riff with vanilla infused bourbon. 

My wife and I had the Braised Shortrib and a Sea Bass, which was one of the specials. Both dishes were very good and fresh tasting, delivering well on the &#39;from-scratch&#39; promise. Would order both dishes again. 

For dessert, the Ginger Creme Br√ªl√©e was a unique taste on a standard dessert. It was good, but my only critique would be that it&#39;s served in a tall narrow dish, as opposed to a broad shallow dish, limiting the amount of toasted sugar crust on the top.

I decided to give them three.stars. I&#39;m giving more than two stars based upon the excellent service we received. He was efficient and knowledgeable. I had a penne pasta meal and all I can say is &#34;eh&#34;. My date had the Sea Scallops offering. She said it was worth the mid 20&#39;s price tag. I had the soup of the day which was some sort of carrot soup. I&#39;d say it appeared to be bland. Sue had a salad which she referred to as pedestrian. The place was crowded so it appeals to enough folks. I think the one item that is most off putting is the coldness of the furnishings. Whatever, I originally was going to give it 4 stars but I just couldn&#39;t do it. I&#39;m sure some one will post something about how great the penne pasta tasted...things like that happen you know. My advice is that the place is ok but stick to the higher priced items. The chef seems to spend more time there. The sign of a great restaurant is that the least of the offerings is still better than other restaurants in the area. If not then RBK is just being pretentious. Also, at no point did the manager talk to any of the customers. The table next to us were three women and at least one of them was a manager. This is the second time here where management seemed more interested  in taste testing the Martinis."

 Upon paying our tab we had a very rare moment with the bartender(she was great, I promise!) .

He never checked on us once, having perfected the art of avoiding making eye contact. 
I&#39;d go back, however, because the food is really good."

Ordered the Pervivan Sampler which included chicken skewers (so tender), ceviche (also good), Papa a la huancaina ( boiled potatoes in creamy sauce) and Peruvian tamales.  Favorite was the Ceviche and the skewers for sure.  Even the appetizer portions were huge and we (2 people) didn&#39;t get to finish all the items.

Main course was spicy seafood fettuccine (HUGE PORTION) that was full of mussels, octopus, shrimp, squid, scallops and clams.  It was nicely prepared, and loved the hint of spiciness.  Italian dish with South American flair.  Love it!  Especially for 23 dollars, it was a steal!  My lovely date ordered the Seafood rice which she couldn&#39;t finish also.

We didn&#39;t get to try any of the specialty cocktails since we were going to the shooting range after, but I definitely see myself coming here again!"

Originally we had taken this place off our bookmark list after trying Middleterranean (same owners, also reviewed), but decided to give it a go anyway. 

It was a Friday night around 6:45 and we were able to get in right away without reservations. The service was very good, our waitress was very friendly and knowledgable of the menu. Delicious fresh pita bread with some spicy sauces arrived at out table shortly after our order. Unfortunately, the rest of the food was just OK. We started with the Incan Tater Tots. They were cooked nicely but bland. They could have used either some spice or a sauce. My girlfriend had the Parrillada de Mariscos. It had lots of seafood and, aside from the Mahi, it was cooked perfectly. The Mahi though was dried out. Similar to the Tater tots, there wasn&#39;t a lot of seasoning, which is good if you want just a clean seafood dish. I ordered the Brochetas Rio De Janeiro. The steak was cooked to medium as I asked, but there was only one scallop among the shrimp on the other skewer.

All in all, everything was good, not great. We&#39;ll be trying somewhere else the next time we get to eat without our toddler (AKA not rushed, no spills, food still hot)."

The lunch specials are really reasonably priced especially considering how big the portions are, definitely beats going anywhere else! The El Guacho skirt steak sandwich is my personal favorite. It comes topped with cheese and avocado, so delicious! 

If you stop by for dinner you absolutely have to get the Bon Bones, Tamales and the Anticuchos for starters, and the Parrillada Casera steak as an entree. Plus the mojitos are a personal favorite from the bar.

I ordered the Pollo Enrollado con Chaufa and Corte de Entrana Estilo Rio.

However, when I got home and opened my food I was quickly disappointed to see that my chicken was forgotten. I called the restaurant right away and told them that they gave me an incomplete order. The young woman on the phone went to talk to the chef to confirm this and then passed the phone to whom I&#39;m assuming was the manager.

He apologized for the mistake and quickly resolved the issue by offering to deliver the entr√©e to my home. While I could of been one of those customers that raise hell and demand something free or be rude, I appreciated the customer service and the solution offered.

The salad and house dressing were out of this world and no doubt the best part of the meal.  The main course included a baby lobster tail and mine was completely overcooked and downright mushy.  

Where this meal failed in my opinion is the fixed menu included dessert but did not provide or allow for any choice.  They served a coconut flan and I am allergic to coconut.  When I brought this to the attention of the waiter, he went on to tell me how he never eats dessert.  Hmm.  I was really hoping for a substitution."

The menu is extensive and has some very different items. Everything has pictures, which I love. Our waiter was really nice and attentive throughout the whole service.

Malbec prices were reasonable as was the selection.

Perhaps most annoying was the attitude of the server, Mariah.  Whatever happened to the common courtesy of waiting until dining guests were NOT talking among themselves before speaking?

The menu has a wide variety  of dishes. The steak used for the Lomo salteado and steak tallerines salteado was not filet mignon which is most typical of Lomo dishes. So the meat was kind of tough and overcooked. We experienced very poor service from the moment we walked in and waited a long time to place an order, so we opted not to order appetizers so as to not delay the service any longer. We went on a Friday night and it was not busy at all there were still lots of empty tables so not sure why they were having issues. I think the Rio&#39;s in the city has better execution of food and service."

I&#39;ve been here four times at decent intervals apart, in different seasons, with different sized parties, for different meals, most recently today for lunch.  

:-/  It just ain&#39;t happening.

It looks great.  The patio is nice.  The food is okay...but it just doesn&#39;t reach the level of flavor and service that makes me a regular.  Memorable bits...  first visit was soon after they opened.  We laughed that the waiter had to be someone&#39;s nephew brought into service in a pinch because he was a disaster.  No matter...  Brought a foodie on another visit and I recall him not being pleased to have an unhappy substitution made on a menu item.  I&#39;m remembering the service always being a bit of a challenge.  Food unmemorable.  

Today for lunch we sat outside.  Lunchtime on a gorgeous day and the vacant tables on the patio weren&#39;t ready.  One was a mess and the other wasn&#39;t set up.  Our server came and I asked for a glass of red with a preferred flavor.  She couldn&#39;t make any suggestions.  The manager was brought in to help but I didn&#39;t get the impression he knew any better.  To him more expensive was better wine.  Uh...not always.

We ordered a skirt steak, medium rare.  While decently sized, it was very thin and therefore more like medium to medium well.  Wasn&#39;t very tender either.  Overall the meal was good but nothing to get excited about.

One quibble...  They had a large drink special board facing the patio promoting their $5 mojito.  Yea!  One was ordered.  Only problem?  The sign said, &#34;Wednesday Drink Special&#34;....and it was Thursday.  After a holiday weekend when I&#39;d been out of town for two days it never occurred to me that I was off a day or that they would advertise a drink special to the room a full week off.  They didn&#39;t honor the price.  Our mistake but it angered my dining partner and I thought it was a silly stand to take over $3."

The meal was yummy. Ceviche was good. The entree was a surf &amp; turf. The menu called it stir fried beef with seafood including lobster. I doubted it myself having a stir fried rice beed at a latino restaurant. However, it was very delicious. We would come back again anyway. The dessert was chocolate cheesecake with chocolate ice-cream which was again very yummy, rich &amp; creamy. The meal was also very reasonable $70-80/ per couple excluding tips. We misunderstood their menu at the beginning and ready to drop $80 per person, $160 for the meal. The meal was definitely tasty and reasonable!"

I have tried many things off the menu here and they have all been super good. I have also been here with my boss and a few other coworkers and we have all enjoyed our meals. The Rio&#39;s lemonade is also super delicious. 
The employees all seem very friendly but the service is a little slow which can be an issue when you are on your lunch break  When I order take out it is normally for myself and a few of my coworkers, so I always call first and it usually takes about 15 or 20 minutes. 
On New Years Eve I met my husband there for lunch. We were given the dinner menu when we got there so I asked for the lunch menu. We were told that they did have sandwiches but were not given a reason for this so I assumed they were out of bread. Since then I have spoken to the manager and the owner there and they explained that on holidays they only serve off of the dinner menu. They also said that they would add that info to their website.
The only thing keeping them from 5 stars is that the slow service."

They made them nice and strong. It could just be the particular bartender we had, but hope it is the same the next time we dine here. We started with the humitas de pollo which was light but very flavorful. We split the pollo a labrasa, which was dry, and the house fried rice, which was definitely our favorite. Lots of steak and shrimp in there. One disappointment, the home fried potatoes that came with the chicken were just generic French fries. Highlights were the drinks and the service, they made the food seem all that much better. Probably go back at least for drinks."

I had their shrimp corn soup which was delicious and my husband had their salad with fresh fruit.

I had the tamal, cebiche and papa a la huancaina. Portions were decent but not huge as with other Peruvian (and cheaper) restaurants. Pisco sours were good and strong enough. They also had Cusque√±a, which made my day. Waitress was friendly but didn&#39;t understand some things (I guess since we pronounced the dishes in Spanish because we&#39;re Peruvian), and did ask many times how we were doing.  While we appreciated it, it was getting a bit uncomfortable to keep a conversation going in our table.

The atmosphere was nice. They have many Peruvian/South American decorations and music. However, the service was slow. The food was good, but I would call it more Latin American fusion than traditional Peruvian. We were really looking forward to it, but walked out disappointed. The papa a la huancaina had a sort of orangey sauce instead of the traditional yellow sauce. The aji de gallina also was orangey red instead of yellow. It tasted nothing like the authentic version. I can&#39;t speak for the others plates, so they might taste more authentic. My husband is Peruvian. We have eaten at other Peruvian restaurants in Chicago, Miami and Lima. Rio&#39;s doesn&#39;t compare in terms of authentic flavor. We don&#39;t live far from Rio&#39;s and were hoping it would be the perfect alternative to having to drive into the city for Peruvian food. However we would rather drive the extra 15 minutes to our favorite Peruvian restaurant, Ay Ay Picante, in the Albany Park neighborhood.  Overall Rio&#39;s has good food, but if you are looking for homemade authentic Peruvian cuisine, Rio&#39;s may not be the place depending on the dish that you choose."

We had a couple of appetizers including a tamale, which was awesome and a ceviche dish that was OK.

My wife had a skirt steak that was very good and the salad was excellent with an interesting mix and greens and a light dressing.

I had a tenderloin and shrimp stir fry dish that had really great flavor but the steak was overcooked for my taste and the shrimp were undercooked, one was inedible.

Their normal bottle of wines seemed overpriced in my opinion for what they were, but we did order a really good bottle of Malbec that was on special and more reasonable.

The waiter was seemed very inexperienced, but I&#39;m fairly certain that he was just new to the job.

Would definetly recommend and will go back to try some other of their wonderful dishes."

What to expect - traffic is usually light (too light for such good food), but the weekend evenings can get busy. You don&#39;t need reservations, but they help on the weekends. Food is primarily South American (especially Argentinian, Peruvian, Chilean) inspired with some Japanese fusion. The restaurant has a good vibe to it - trendy enough at the bar, quiet enough at the tables, nice outside seating area. Their ceviche is to die for, Entr√©e&#39;s are great - especially the skirt steak and the mixed seafood options - and the bread will keep you coming back for more.

Not enough people know about this restaurant but if you are looking for something a little different and are in Schaumburg, Itasca, Bloomingdale, Lombard, Elmhurst it is worth the 10 minute ride to Lake Street in Addison. This is my must go to destination for clients, friends and family. Enjoy!"

Their menu looked so amazing and the reviews of the fried bread had me very excited. I could hardly narrow down my options to only 1 main course. My family was coming in from out of town and wanted a new and different experience, so I figured Peruvian/Brazillian food would definitely meet that criteria. 

I saw the new discounted appetizer menu on their website.  They were only available until 7pm so I made reservations for 6:30 to ensure I got my butt there in time. My table of 4 was promptly seated in the tiny dining area.  I asked the hostess if we would be able to take advantage of the discounted appetizers or if we needed to sit and have a drink at the bar for that portion.  She had me wait while she checked (suprised by the lack of autonomy given to the hostess).  She came back and said we were only able to get those appetizers (which are not even on the menu at regular price) if we sat in the bar area.  Naturally, I obliged since I already had my heart set on two of them. She mentioned this information came from the manager.  We were moved a whole 10 feet (place is tiny) to a less comfortable bar table. What a turnoff that they would make an issue of this.  

I loved the shrimp claws, but the tamales were just okay.  I ordered the classic peruvian non-alcoholic beverage, chicha morada, which was very sweet and yummy. The main course was good. I split the Moqueca de Pescado &amp; Aji de Gallina with my husband. Honestly, I was slightly disappointed with the meal as I expected more flavor and seasoning.  While not bland, it certainly wasn&#39;t as seasoned as expected. It tasted like they had held back to accomodate traditional American tastebuds.

We got the churros for dessert. They weren&#39;t filled with caramel like the menu lead me to believe. They were okay, but not as good as Mexican churros I&#39;m used to. I wouldn&#39;t recommend them unless you&#39;ve just never had a churro at all.   As with previous reviewers, they were once again out of their traditiona Lucumal ice cream. They may as well take it off the menu if they are never going to have it.  Also, they had a new desert menu released for May and advertised on their Facebook page-none of those items were available. 

It wasn&#39;t until the next day when I realized the thing that now upsets me the most.  THEY NEVER GAVE US THE FRIED BREAD! The appetizer that everyone gets and I was so excited about was never given to us. I can&#39;t beleive it! I wonder if it was because we sat at the bar to get the special appetizers. Wow! If I knew I would have to pick...obviously I would have gone for the bread. What a bummer!

In Summary:
Rio&#39;s, you get 2 stars because of horrible customer service overall and food that, while not bad, just doesn&#39;t meet expectations. You should not have a menu of special appetizers that are only available in the bar, but rather, offer those same items for full price on your regular menu.  You create a difficult situation for a patron to try those items otherwise. Don&#39;t release a dessert menu publicly until it is actually available.  And, most importantly, relax on your strict policies.  I wanted your establishment to become a regular in my rotation of ethnic cousines, but instead I have decided to never come back."

Their flat bread appetizer was served with 3 condiments and all had very good flavor.  The entr√©e included fried plantains which are often on people&#39;s menus but rarely done correctly.  These were perfect and went very well with the glass of Malbec I had with dinner.  My only complaint is the plating was done so that it was awkward to cut the skirt steak and avoid the tower of rice.  It would have been better to reverse some things keeping in mind the need to cut the steak.  Service was very good and I enjoyed my evening on the patio.

I was very disappointed the last couple times I&#39;ve been here, the food was mediocre, they lost that Peruvian seasoning that kept me coming back. Food is now bland, not to mention they took away one of my favorites off the menu the Tallarines verdes con bistec apanado. So disappointed :( .. Instead they have ravioli!

Once I walked in, however, I knew I was in the right place. The ambiance was amazing! Very classy and upscale but still casual enough that I felt comfortable in Uggs.
We started with the steak filled wontons with tamarind sauce. The have somehow excellently merged South American and Asian cuisine and this dish was an ode to that. 
For dinner I had the aji de gallina (chicken in a Peruvian sauce). It was amazing and made me regret filling up on wontons. The black beans I ordered alongside my dish were excellent and very flavorful. The chicken was tender and the sauce was creamy, but not too rich; very complex flavors that did not rely on salt or cheese. I added some plantanos to my dish and I was in HEAVEN.
My husband tried a fusion dish-- the Rios Special Chaufa Saltado. It is a rice dish with steak and shrimp. He isn&#39;t a very adventurous eater but he cleaned the plate! The proteins were excellently cooked and the flavors were savory and slightly sweet.

Healthy portions, excellent food, friendly staff, and a very classy ambiance made for a pleased diner!! Thanks Rios!"

I highly recommend the quinoa salad and it is one of my favorite items on the menu aside from the meat dishes. The service was a bit slow the second time I went to the restaurant, but I think it contributed to the South American cultural aesthetic of the restaurant.

The menu has influences from several South American regions.  Some dishes have a Cuban flare.  Your tab will be a little higher than average but the fresh and different dishes and flavors we&#39;ll make up for it.

My only negative comment would be that the kitchen tends to get overwhelmed with even the slightest hint of a crowd.  Expect to wait a little while for meals when it&#39;s busy.

We love coming to this restaurant because the food  has always been excellent. The complimentary fried yucca bread with various dipping sauces are a perfect start to the meal. Jalea de Mariscos is a great appetizer if you like deep fried calamari and mixed seafood. The Chupe de Camarones is a shrimp chowder that was okay but not as creamy like most chowders I&#39;ve had. Because the dinner entrees tend to be large, we will generally split one dish. Our favorite and go-to dish has been the Corte de Entrana Estilo Rios, which is a wonderful combination of well seasoned and flavorful skirt steak, sweet fried plantains, black beans, fresh side salad, and rice. No matter what dish you go with be sure to order a side of sweet fried plantains, they&#39;re delicious! 
The only thing that kept me from giving Rio&#39;s a five star review is that the level of service can use some refinement. There are times when there are very few customers in the restaurant and it will take quite awhile before a server will take our order or even check up on our table to replenish our water or see if we are enjoying the meal. But there&#39;s been times, where we have had excellent service and our attentive waiter is well-versed with the food/drink and provides accurate recommendations based on our tastes. 
So overall, our experience has been very good and we plan to continue to make Rio&#39;s a regular spot for us to enjoy good food and time together."

Their service was great, they even gave me a free gift when I went on my birthday. 

To start out, the bread and butter: absolute perfection!! I could make a meal out of that bread, butter, and whatever other dipping sauce they served with it. Their steak is always cooked to perfection and their flavors are fantastic.

The only thing keeping me from giving this 5 stars is that I went for lunch once and was a little underwhelmed. Everything was delicious, but the rice was a little under-cooked and the shrimp was just a little too cold. But the flavor was still perfect. And my sister got a burger and loved it as well!"

The venue is very nice, both times it seemed a bit quite/slow but it was on a week night.  The food is great!  The menu was easy to navigate, with pictures to make it easier to see what your options are.  Our server was very helpful and personable as well.  The first time I went I had the Aji de Gallina.  This was SOOOO good!  Our server suggested ordering it a bit more spicy and was super delicious.  The second time I had the Lomo Saltado al Pisco.  This was also very good, but I enjoyed the first dish I tried.

Needless to say, I will be going back (as I already have) and have already told others about this gem.  Check it out."

We were treating my Mom to dinner and wanted to go slightly classy.  First, the ambience is truly superb.  The room is beautiful and I loved the South American music they were playing.  It definitely had a Sergio Mendez/ Lani Hall vibe.  It really set the mood nicely.
Our food was excellent across the board.  I started with the Cerviche Nikkei and had it with the bits of flounder.  This was very nicely done with a small roasted potato on the side and this delicious Peruvian corn.
My Mom and I ordered the same paella entr√©e that was filled with shrimp, octopus and scallops.  The rice and seasonings were perfect.  I can&#39;t recall enjoying a paella as much as I did that I had at Rio&#39;s.  My wife ordered the South American / pan-Asian noodle dish and she loved it as well.  I tasted it and it had a succinctly different flavor profile that our paella dish.  I read the criticism from another reviewer regarding the lack of fresh ingredients.  Although we did not order a salad, all of the ingredients in our dishes were very flavorful and fresh.
Finally, our server Christopher was great!  Engaging and attentive, he took care of all of our needs.  I have no hesitation in giving Rio&#39;s 5-stars!"

We never had south American food before and this was great. They served us a fried bread cut into strips with 3 condiments a peppered compound butter a spicy puree and a paisley cilantro compote. My wife had a shrimp and rice dish with plantains and black beans. Only thing she didn&#39;t care for were were black beans. She loved everything else. 

I had the Lamb shank with rice and pinto beans. The shank fell off the bone. No knife needed! It had a nice sauce that was a cilantro base to it that I really enjoyed. The pinto beans were awesome. Never had this style of beans before. Great alternative to Mexican refried.

Couple issues it was freezing in the place they had the lights down so low it was hard to read the menu. The menu is like a photo album and the print blends into the photos. Would have done 4 stars if that was better. 

We will be going back! The food was very good. It was great to have something different that still had south of the border flavors."

We ordered wontons for appetizers, which we gobbled up, and the fried bread they served with dipping sauces was inhaled. Unfortunately, for my partner and I, we got into a discussion that ruined the mood for the night, so by the time our entrees arrived, I lost my appetite. 

I did enjoy the taltrines saltados, but I just couldn&#39;t bring myself to finish it; I can&#39;t remember what his is called, but it looked appetizing as well having a spicy fettuccine noodles with steak medallions. In the end, our dinner was ruined by our own accord.

The service was really good and I felt bad that we came across as having a terrible meal, so I hope this somehow gets to him so he&#39;d know it wasn&#39;t his fault. We definitely turned down dessert so we could just get out of there and because the server knew it was our anniversary, he gave us a little gift box, which we just opened and found a cute little couple doll pin and a keychain from Peru. 

We would definitely go back and probably avoid having serious, mood-altering discussions the next time around to fully enjoy the experience."

I had grown tired of the only &#34;latin food&#34; option around here being American interpretations of Mexican food.  That being said, I believe the owners must have something against Ecuador.  Their so called Ecuadorean dish consists of the side dishes served just about anywhere in South America: rice, salad, fried egg.  if they are to call this dish after Ecuador, maybe at least they should investigate the multiple, very unique special dishes served in Ecuador.  For example, they could add llapingachos (a potato cheese mini pancake of sorts) if their intent is to keep the meal vegetarian.  As an alternative, they could add empanadas de verde- another uniquely and truly Ecuadorian choice.  If they want to invest some time, they could pair the sides dishes with hornado or fritada."

I travel very often and being that my father is of Peruvian decent, I always look for great Peruvian cuisine anywhere I go. As I search for this on Yelp, Rio&#39;s came up with 3 stars out of 327 reviews. I thought to myself, we might have a winner and the deal was sealed when I saw Peruvian dishes such as Ceviche and Lomo Saltado. I have never been so wrong in my life and Yelp has never failed me so badly out of all my years of using it as a guide.

I arrive to Rio&#39;s and sat at the bar. The bartender starts small talk and I eventually ask where the chef is from and his exact words were &#34;Our old chef was recently let go and he was from Peru.&#34; Yet he didn&#39;t know where the new, current chef was from. Already feeling like I already made a mistake, I decided not to jump the gun so I gutted it out and order a Ceviche Clasico (classic) for starters. Let&#39;s just say that Rio&#39;s needs to call back and rehire the chef from Peru they let go! Ceviche is a dish that even if it isn&#39;t made that well is very tasteful and delicious...this one was flat out horrendous. I also asked the platter to be a mix of fish and shrimp. The plate only came out with fish and I had to advise the bartender the shrimp was missing. The bartender came back from letting the chef know of the overlooked error and the bartender said &#34;I went back and told the chef about the shrimp and he gave me this for you to have.&#34; It was a small bowl of shrimp &#34;ceviche.&#34; This little bowl of shrimp was even more terrible than the fish Ceviche I previously had. In my book, if you can&#39;t conjure up regular ceviche don&#39;t try making fusion dishes of a classic Peruvian dish that is known around the world.

Next was their $30 Boneless NY Strip...sounds scrumptious right?!?!....WRONG!!! I asked for this beautifully displayed piece of meat on their menu to be cooked medium, like any seasoned for days in aged spices meat is suppose to be. Never have I cut into the first piece of a NY strip and it not drip in juicy, slightly red, watery gravy goodness. It made me question if the steak was good medium at all so I kept cutting. At this very moment, a guy who I assume was shift manager at the time said &#34;is there anything wrong with your steak?&#34; I told him &#34;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s cooked medium&#34; and he glanced at it and said &#34;I&#39;m so sorry, I will get you another one&#34; and asked if medium was the correct cook temp&#34; which I said yes to. He comes back with the same steak butchered....I mean, cut in half,  to show me that the steak was cooked medium. So you can imagine that I haven&#39;t even taken a bite out of the steak and it&#39;s been cut like 5 times already so I am saying to myself...this better be worth the taste. Yet again...WRONG!!! The steak was the most mediocre NY Strip I have ever tasted in my life and instead of $30, it should have been $9.99! I never knew what strip club food tasted like until I ate the steak. Out of frustration and hunger, also being out of town with the urge of just wanting to get back to my hotel, I manned up and just ate the damn thing. Afterwards the same manager guy asked me how was the steak and I told him bland and very mediocre for the price. None of that matter because he still charged me for it which I found hilarious but I felt bad because the place was pretty empty and seems like it doesn&#39;t get much business with the turnover of terrible first timer experiences that happens there. That explains a 3 star rating with 327 reviews.

So I warn anybody and everybody...tread faraway from this location unless you want a horrible outing. Don&#39;t say you haven&#39;t been warn!"

I read some of the reviews and was a bit put off since some of the comments weren&#39;t too positive. We decided to try it anyway and give Rios the benefit of the doubt, and I&#39;m so glad we did!

The staff were all friendly, and our waitress (who also happened to be the bartender, I think) answered our many questions and offered up suggestions from the menu.

I ordered the Rios Ceviche, which was absolutely delicious. It was served with sweet potato and corn. My husband ordered the fried sole, which was probably one of the tastiest fish dishes I&#39;ve ever had. I don&#39;t recall what type of sauce was on the fish, but it was just so flippin good! 

We weren&#39;t planning on having dessert, but our waitress convinced us we just had to try the churros. And wow! Definitely glad we ordered them. 

Lastly, the pricing was totally fair. All the entrees were basically in the $15-20 range. And you definitely get what you pay for. The portions were perfect.

My husband and I will absolutely come back to Rios for another date night."

The japanese tofu dishes are pretty yummy, but Minghin tends to go heavy on the sauce. It&#39;s good if you like pairing rice with the sauce, but I really don&#39;t like soupy dishes. Dim sum dishes (shumai, BBQ pork buns) were decent, but not super fresh. Not sure if that was because we ordered carry out or if it&#39;s just how their dishes are."

The host prepared our table immediately even though it was starting to get busy and looked pretty full. We we seated in the back in a nice booth. The interior here is probably one of the nicest Chinese restaurants I have seen. I heard it gets really busy here so we got there a little early on Sunday around 11:30.

Food wise everything was ok. We ordered dimsum, beef noodles, fried rice, and BBQ duck. Was not a fan of the duck or fried rice but the noodles were good (not too salty or oily like most places). Dimsum was also good. What really shocked me was the bill which came out to less than $50. For the amount of food we ordered it was a great deal and we left full. Service was also good and attentive.

Saves a trip to the city but know the food is not as good, still better than most places in the burbs.

Service at Chinese restaurants is a rarity and this location continues to break that trend like the one in Chinatown, though the service is actually better here if you ask me. They are more attentive with refilling water and tea and getting things is pretty much immediate and very polite.

Japanese Tofu 2 ways - 5 each of: a slice of tofu, a slice of scallop then topped with either garlic or black bean. It was very flavorful, strong bold garlic and black bean tastes.  I loved mixing the topping with my rice to stretch the flavor out and make it last longer.

Seafood in a nest: Shrimp, scallop, peapods, mushroom, celery in a potato nest. The nest is pretty terrible and it lacks sauce to flavor it so it&#39;s just mushy flavorless cardboard essentially. The cook on the ingredients were good though.

Beef short ribs with Salt and Pepper - not a normal menu item, we requested it. It was not battered so not your traditional salt and pepper. It was more like honey beef short ribs w/ jalapenos and red and green peppers diced up and cooked.  It was pretty good tasting but it wasn&#39;t what I expected.

Cage free chicken - very little meat but then again I guess most of the naturally raised stuff is like that.  It had great flavor though.  I wish the green onion and ginger oil had less ginger in it and more oil and green onion. Also there were many bone shards in the chicken, I think it&#39;s due to poor chopping technique on the duck.

BBQ Combo platter - you get to pick 4 things, they were out of BBQ pork so we were stuck with the other 3
Ribs pieces - actually quite tender and flavorful, a bit honey&#39;ed but they give you sugar to dip in so you can make it even sweeter which really helped if you ask me
Roast Duck - not roasted enough so the skin was not very crispy.  Also was a very thin duck so there wasn&#39;t a lot of meat
Pork Belly - excellent ratio of fat to meat, had wonderful flavor and great crunch to the skin,

Rice noodle with Beef - basically HK beef noodles - they used way too much oil and did not cook it enough, it was mushy when it should be firm/chewey. There was good wok hei/smokiness though to it.

Overall, I will wait until the Rolling Meadows one opens, opening soon!, it is much closer and hopefully will have better cooks.  It could have been a 5 star if they had perfected the dishes instead of what they served us."

I recommend the deep fried pork dumplings, pan fried vegetable and pork buns, and beef crepe. The crepe was generously stuffed with beef filling, although it could have used a bit more of the sweet soy sauce. I also tried the pan fried taro cake but didn&#39;t like the dry texture. I probably should have gotten the pan fried turnip cake instead.

I&#39;ve also ordered the pork belly with preserved vegetables and chicken feet for take-out and they were good. 

Now the reason why I give Minghin a mediocre rating is because of two, unedible dishes: beef brisket and ginger pig feet. The brisket was impossible to chew. I had to either swallow my piece whole or spit it out. Flavor was also not there and the brisket was strangely a little sticky. The ginger pig feet was sickeningly sweet. Taste is certainly subjective, but I don&#39;t believe anyone could enjoy such a level of sweetness. In fact, I wonder if they accidentally put double the sugar. The ginger flavor was also very strong and reminded me of the ginger water my mom had me drink when I got sick as a child. 

I would still recommend Minghin for anyone who likes dimsum, but don&#39;t order the beef brisket and pig feet!"

Good thing I checked on Yelp because I found this place and it was only 25 minutes away! I was really surprised to see MingHin open in the suburbs, considering it&#39;s a popular dim sum restaurant in Chicago. There&#39;s a lot of parking and when we got to the restaurant around 1:30pm, it was super packed. We each received a post it note with our number and used a microphone to announce the next number for seating. They told us it was a 25 minute wait (even though it was super packed) and we were seated 25 minutes later! There was a bunch of seats in the entrance so waiting wasn&#39;t too bad.

We were seated on a table usually for 6 but we didn&#39;t mind since we were hungry! We ordered our favorite dishes when eating dim sum: shrimp crepes, shrimp dumplings, and deep fried taro. The food was delicious and high quality for a dim sum restaurant in the suburbs. It was like eating in Chinatown except we were in the suburbs! I loved the shrimp dumplings and crepes they&#39;re my favorite foods to eat at dim sum. The deep fried taro was delicious and crunchy, so good! We noticed that there weren&#39;t any carts with the foods on them, which is a typical experience at a dim sum restaurant in Chicago. However, we ordered the foods and they brought our order within 5 to 10 minutes. The service was great and several waiters made sure our waters and jasmine tea were refilled and were ready to take our order at any time. We ordered the Mango pudding for dessert and it was heavenly! 

As the for interior, it was super modern and gorgeous. I know the restaurant used to be an old Mexican restaurant so it still looks the old Mexican restaurant on the outside but the inside looks beautiful. 

5 stars for excellent service and high quality dim sum. Now we don&#39;t have to drive all the way to Chicago for delicious dim sum!"

It&#39;s like going to Chinatown, but it&#39;s so much closer to my house! Ok, so first of all, this restaurant is BEAUTIFUL. There is tons of space. The front has a great waiting area. We got a number and they use a microphone to call the numbers so there really is not a way to miss yourself being called. The front of the restaurant has more of the family style tables. Bring a group of 10 and they can definitely handle it! The back rooms are for the smaller groups and couples. I like how this place is sectioned off because it is quieter in the back and is better if you are just with one other person. 

Onto the food-this Minghin location offers Dim Sum ALL DAY. That&#39;s right. Definitely order from this menu, even if it is just for a few things. We ordered from this menu. My husband and I wanted a good idea of the food here, so we tried a lot of different things. We got the banana avocado tapioca smoothie (not on the menu, but you can just combine fruits that they offer). The smoothie was very good and was just as tasty as Joy Yee&#39;s smoothies. For food we got the short ribs in honey sauce, the fried spring rolls, the siu mai, the beef crepes, the creamy egg yolk buns, the pork belly macau style, and the roast duck pan fried rice noodles. 

The dishes that really stood out here include the short ribs in honey sauce, the pork belly, and the egg yolk buns. You MUST get the egg yolk buns. I&#39;ve never had anything like this before and it was so delicious. It was a perfect combination of sweet and salty and it was just a fluffy pillow of egg awesomeness. I can&#39;t describe it any better. The short ribs are a bit tough, but has a lot of flavor and I enjoyed them. Everything else tasted great as well. The siu mai are filled to the brim, the beef crepes are very good, but you have to be in the mood for that texture. The pork belly was perfectly crispy on top and braised on the bottom, and the pan noodles were very good too.  For the noodles, I wish that there was more meat and more noodles that came in a serving. 

Service was okay. They have a pretty efficient system of making sure you receive all of the food items that you mark down on your paper. It was a bit hard flagging down a waitress, though. We had to wait 10 minutes after our check to get almond cookies and fortune cookies, which I believe that they are supposed to pass out at the end of the meal. Some people were getting them and some were not, and after I asked for them (I would have paid if needed) it still took 10 minutes to get them. Our waters were refilled during our visit and we did get our food pretty quickly. 

MingHin is an awesome place. It gets busy, but its a great place to eat and is the best place in this area to get dim sum. We will definitely return!"

BBQ Pork Buns, Pan Fried Pork Buns, Egg Yolk Paste Buns... So many hot buns and so little time. 

I loved every dumpling or bun that I tried. The pork dumplings with peanuts were his favorite, while mine were the Siu Mai (pork and shrimp). One of the things I love about dim sum is the way something new keeps arriving throughout the meal. I think every restaurant should take that approach as well. --It&#39;s like unwrapping presents on Christmas Day. Just after you finish sampling something, a new something arrives.  

The only thing I didn&#39;t care for was the brisket. Just way too fatty for my liking. Burned a lot of cals just trying to chew it. And while I loved the Fu-Kin Fried Rice --dried scallops, scallops, duck, and chicken, He thought it was fishy tasting. I heartily disagreed. But it came as no surprise when I went downstairs the next morning and saw that he left my leftovers out all night. Drat! Had to toss. He probably did that on purpose. ;)  

This restaurant always looks completely packed, but wait times are generally 20 min or so on weekday evenings. Up to an hour on weekend evenings. They do have a ton of seating though. A benefit since they don&#39;t take reservations."

MingHin Cuisine has long been known as a Chinatown staple for classy dim sum and they have recently opened another beautiful location in downtown as well. This location in Naperville continues to impress and I would be suprised if the owners weren&#39;t trying to push their case for a Michelin Star.

Spacious parking, gorgeous decor, attractive exterior, speedy service, and a wide variety of menu options make this the perfect place to go for a large gathering of family &amp; friends. Unlike many of the Chinatown options, you won&#39;t have to worry about being packed tightly in the dining rooms nor being so loud you can&#39;t have a conversation. In the suburbs, this is definitely the place to go for dim sum in terms of both quality and selection. There are a few items you can find elsewhere (like Bistro Chen or Royal Buffet) that are fairly good as well, but neither possesses anywhere near as many options as Minghin offers -- and not consistently at as good of a quality.

Like Lao Sze Chuan in Skokie, the food at the Minghin location outside Chinatown is not only good for the suburbs -- it&#39;s among the best for Chinese in Chicagoland. Food temperature was great, items were generally not too sweet or salty and did not rely on sauce for flavor, and textures were excellent. Here are the items that stood out for me:

Tea: Nothing ruins a great dim sum experience more than using poor quality tea. This is not an issue here as the tea is tasty, hot, and delicious.

Fried squid: Light, crispy fluffy batter that covers softly prepared squid. Simple and delciious way to start a meal.

Beef crepe: This is among the best in the area you&#39;ll find (Phoenix is the other great one that comes to mind). The chewy elastic rice crepe perfectly envelopes a soft filling of spiced and herbed beef prepared masterfully in a thin meat patty. No restaurant outside of Chinatown even comes close to the quality of this crepe.

Baked creamy egg yolk bun -- Imagine a delicious egg yolk filling that is not quite creamy but not quite hard boiled surrounded by a slightly chewy dough and this is what you get. Based on the quality of this dish, I&#39;ll need to try the puffy egg custard tart one day.

Chicken and dried scallop bun. Not sure why all the steamed options are called bun instead of bao, but this really delivered in terms of dough fluffiness and having a tasty meat filling. The dough is a bit sweeter than what you&#39;d expect from a bao but this worked out perfectly with the meat. Try the BBQ Pork bun if you&#39;ve tried bao elsewhere, the difference in quality is apparent from the first bite.

Fresh fish paste congee: Definitely the creamiest congee I&#39;ve had anywhere in the Chicago suburbs. Healthy and lightly flavored, this is a perfect item to have on a cold day or if you&#39;re looking for a more soupy-type option.

Crispy Pork Belly Macau Style: Perfectly marianated pork from a nice juicy and fat cut with a delicious crispy skin. It&#39;s great to find such high quality Chinese BBQ outside of Chinatown (I believe the next closest respectable choice is in Richwell Market in Morton Grove, but it doesn&#39;t even come close to this).

Pork Rice Noodle Roll with XO Sauce: Just like the rice crepe, the rice noodle roll has a fantatic bouncy texture to it and is perfectly presented with spicy XO sauce and peppers.

Fu-Kin Style Fried Rice: One of the more saucy preparations of fried rice, but the egg flavor is infused perfectly into the rice and the sauce captures the flavors of meat and seafood very well. 

Overall, a fantastic experience. I only regret that I cannot write a much longer review without this being the size of a chapter in a reference book and that my stomach didn&#39;t have the capacity to try more dishes (you can easily get super-full with even trying half a piece each of a huge order of dim sum!). Definitely worth the trip if you live anywhere west of O&#39;Hare airport, it&#39;ll completely alter your perceptions of fine Chinese cuisine."
minghin-cuisine-naperville,Angela P.,3lUkFxUQKeMUYH7-z_kmjg,"Aurora, IL",1,1,1,401,21,di2nbEtYg1cmPYXEeGjBFw,4.0,2016-07-23,"The service at MingHin leaves a little to be desired, but the food is just as good as their Chinatown location.

I was easily able to make reservations for a group of 10.  When we arrived, we were seated in a brightly lit dining room, with high ceilings and a lot of white and gold touches.  The interior looks like a palace.

On behalf of the group, I chose to opt out of ordering tons of dishes to share, since not everyone has the same sense of adventure when it comes to ordering.  MingHin&#39;s menu has a lot of familiar dishes like General Tso chicken and crab rangoon, but there are a lot of other unfamiliar dishes like pigeon and a dish that resembled coconut Jell-O.  The best part of the menu though is the dim sum - and it&#39;s ALL DAY dim sum.

The menu does not contain descriptions, only photos and names of items.  I don&#39;t need a full biography of everything, but I prefer to see brief descriptions that include ingredients.  My husband &amp; I ordered a few things to share, and I really liked most of them:

*Crab Rangoon.  No joke, the BEST crab rangoon ever.  Eating these ruined crab rangoon from anywhere else.  These are made with real crab, proportionate to the cream cheese, and cooked perfectly.

*Short Rib with Honey Sauce.  The texture was too jerky-like for me, but I generally don&#39;t like eating meat off the bone anyway.  

*Egg Rolls.  Surprisingly not that great.  Skip these.

*BBQ Pork Bun.  Soft, fluffy buns with BBQ pork tucked inside.  We should have ordered more of these.

*Chicken Wings.  These were my husband&#39;s pick.  I did not like these at all.  Very little flavor, dry, and small.

When it comes to service, they were great about splitting up our checks into groups.  For our table of 10, we split our tabs into I think 4 different checks.  I&#39;m not sure how they kept track, but for the most part it worked out okay.  My one complaint about the service is that they would drop food at our table and very quickly walk away without telling us what it is!  When most of the food is covered in sauce or fried into buns, everything looks the same.  The food was delivered at strange intervals too, so while three of our friends chowed down on several dim sum dishes, two of my friends hadn&#39;t had a single bite yet.

MingHin&#39;s food is delicious, and the restaurant is pretty and a good size for larger groups.  It is probably best if your large group all wants to eat the same dishes though, which would make it less confusing when food gets dropped off at the table.  The food stands out from other Chinese restaurants though, so I&#39;ll definitely be back soon."

For dim sum, we ordered:
Shrimp dumpling - when I pick up the shrimp dumpling with a chopstick, the shrimp doesn&#39;t fall out.
 Siu mai
 Chicken feet
 Rice crepe with deep fried doughnut
 Pork dumpling with peanuts
 Sticky rice Lotus Leaf
 Spare rib noodle in pot
 Baked BBQ pork turnover - not greasy
 Jumbo sesame ball - not greasy

 BBQ pork bun - a lot of BBQ pork.  
 Pork preserved egg congee - hint of sweetness but not soupy
 Egg custard tart - the shell is flaky but not greasy
 Three color egg custard - the shell is flaky but not greasy

For dessert, we ordered:
 Mini sweet custard roll
 Mango pudding

 Coconut pudding

For dinner, we ordered:
 Nagaimo yam
 Ginkgo shrimp

 Salt and pepper Japanese tofu - the breading is really light and not greasy
 Rib eye steak with asparagus

For drinks, we ordered:
 Lemon green tea
 Red bean coconut freeze - this is best to order last for it&#39;s very filling.

There are many things that Minghin does right.  They do not nickel and dime customers to death.  There are no charge for refills on soft drinks, no charge for tea, and include utensils and napkins for carry-out.

The service was impeccable.  The hostess and multiple servers greeted us when we walked in.  Our server pulled out the chairs for us.  Different servers came by multiple times to see if we needed a refill on the tea.  Our server came by with two forks on a napkin without asking.  More importantly, she took our carry-out order to our car without asking.  The hostess opened the door for us when we leave.  How cool is that?"

This is the same restaurant as Chinatown in Chicago which I&#39;ve been to many times over the last 5 years or more.  It&#39;s great that they opened up a location in the suburbs so we don&#39;t have to go all the way down to get it.  Yes, it&#39;s that good."

The other location in China Town came highly recommended by a friend, so I was really happy to see this location open up.... and it definitely did not disappoint. 

The problem with most places in the suburbs is that they end up dumbing down their menus because suburban eaters just aren&#39;t that adventurous.  This place does use a smaller menu than their China Town location but there&#39;s still good depth to the menu.

The fried pork belly was a definite star of the meal.  My favorites on the dimsum menu were the shu mai, the shrimp with chives, and the egg yolk bun. The egg yolk bun is an easy one to do poorly but it was outstanding here.  Everything else we tried was good too. The bbq pork buns and turnovers weren&#39;t too sweet, and the egg rolls were good. The fried duck was delicious but not really my thing. The texture of the duck was fantastic I&#39;m just not a fan of all the bones you get in duck. The beef with black bean sauce was savory and good but didn&#39;t stand out in the group of other entrees.

Make sure you try the sweet and sour sauce,  it&#39;s a world better than the usual pink slurry your neighborhood place serves. It&#39;s worth ordering the egg rolls just for that sweet and sour sauce. 

Is it the best Chinese food I&#39;ve ever had? Close but no. But, it&#39;s by far the best in the suburbs."
minghin-cuisine-naperville,Derrick T.,_qRV6YI3wm6hF0SF-2z8ng,"Woodridge, IL",1,1,1,125,481,bl9S89CciM2tEUawi0BbgA,4.0,2016-02-15,"So I love my dimsum.  Seriously.  I&#39;m Chinese.  How could I not like the stuff I&#39;ve grown up eating all my life with family on weekends??

My relationship with Minghin has been love and hate... when they first opened in Chinatown, they shut down one of my favorite dimsum places (and about 5 others) to open they&#39;re mega restaurant... and like a bad breakup, it took me awhile to get over that.. but once I did, Minghin in the city was the freakin&#39; bomb... (though definitely a bit more expensive than my old standby).  Gorgeous interior, great quality food, etc.

This one that has opened in Naperville isn&#39;t the same experience.  And here&#39;s the scoop...

Customer service:  The service here is far friendlier!  They actually have smiles on their faces, and come by to check on you fairly regularly!  Better than Chinatown by far.

Decor:  Very modern looking, and very bright.  Lots of shiny white surfaces, giving it a very clean look.  Their layout could probably use some revamping, as I&#39;m confident they could fit more seats in the place than they have now, but there&#39;s something nice about having lots of elbow room as well.  Better than Chinatown.

Food:  So this is where things differ quite a bit.  

Pork Congee:  It was definitely more flavorful here than Chinatown.  Lots of porkiness, and they didn&#39;t skimp on the ingredients at all!  Better than Chinatown.

BBQ Pork Bun, steamed:  I don&#39;t know if they handmake these (unlikely) or whether they bring in from a vendor (probably) but they aren&#39;t as good here.  The bao itself is too mushy, and texturely far different than what we get in Chinatown Minghin.  I don&#39;t know if the Chinatown one has changed vendors (it&#39;s been a few months since I&#39;ve been there) but the one here was inferior to what we used to get.

Siu Mai:  Again, unsure if it&#39;s handmade or vendor, but they&#39;re siu mai here have thick cut pieces of Chinese mushroom in it.  It&#39;s not a bad thing, just different than the finer dice used in Chinatown.  

Turnip Cake:  Tasty was good, but the outside wasn&#39;t fried crispy enough... it needed a nice hard fry to crisp up the edges/exterior to contrast the interior softness.  Chinatown does this one better.

Verdict:  All in all, there are some plus and minuses to this new Minghin that I hope will continue to improve... though they were so packed on a Tuesday lunch, they may have no need to.  Service was better, some food items were better, and I don&#39;t have to drive 45 minutes and fight for parking... but the Minghin in Chinatown so far still wins from a food quality perspective."

I can&#39;t say enough good things about the food here. The dim sum (and other menu offerings) are delicious! Everything is made fresh to order so you don&#39;t have to worry about how long the food has been sitting in carts. You also don&#39;t have to worry about dim sum carts bumping into you or trying to find the cart that has the dishes you want. Just sit, order off a menu, and wait for the hot plates to come your way straight from the kitchen.

My go-to dishes are the fried squid, pork sticky rice, Chinese broccoli, salted fish fried rice, steamed pork buns, custard rolls, and other assorted dim sum dumplings that change depending on my mood. If you live near the Naperville area, I would recommend stopping by if you&#39;re in the mood for delicious Chinese food. You know this place is good when the restaurant is packed with Chinese people on opening day even though the restaurant did nothing to advertise."

I received shrimp with a few mushrooms and not very good bok choy. I also asked for brown sauce, but I received a white sauce that was very poor. Also, it was almost $11, and that is a lot for a lunch special. Most places would charge about $8.00 for a shrimp meal. I do frequent Chinese restaurants often, but I do not think I will go to this one again.

No dim sum carts so everything you have to order through the kitchen. And the staff is OKAY, they&#39;re just friendly enough not to get fired.

We came here three days after their initial open and being seated was okay since we made reservations. After being seated, we ordered our food. Granted they were busy, but the end result was, we had to ask 4-5 times for fried rice, which they forgot, each time. Not even kidding about this, by the time we were done with our food, we happened to ask one last time, then did they acknowledge it. 

I believe this place focuses mainly more on the ambiance rather than the food. While they serve dim-sum, you&#39;re better off getting quality dim-sum at Raku down the street. For better quality authentic cuisine I would suggest Joy Yee Noodle and Mapo around the corner. 

I do like Minghin, but not here, the menu and service itself overall is actually, contrary to the initial belief, FAR better at their main location in Chinatown/Chicago. 

Sidebar: hostesses, when asked how long a wait time is, and you aren&#39;t sure, please don&#39;t state the obvious (when it&#39;s obvious the answer is otherwise) that the wait time is &#34;10 minutes&#34;, because after waiting nearly 40 minutes for a call, it gets a bit tiresome. Clean up your attitude a bit, there are quite a few other people of younger age that would happily take the position you have for a few bucks an hour less that can outperform you on even the most basic of tasks. Okay? Great :).

But you know what that means, right? Driving all the way to Chinatown. And neither of us wanted to do that on a Friday night after working all week. We&#39;re so suburban. But frankly, for good dim sum, we would make the sacrifice. 

That&#39;s when I remembered Minghin sitting on my bookmarks list. A quick map search and we realized that Minghin was 5 miles from our house. Five. Miles. That&#39;s even walkable. Not that that was going to happen.

Holy cow, guys. The place is gorgeous with a capital ORGE. I&#39;ve been to Asia and haven&#39;t seen places this pretty. Their interior decorator really needs a raise because they did a beautiful job, and not in that tacky cheap Chinese restaurant style that I know you&#39;re familiar with. This was upscale elegant and we felt a little slobby in our sweatpants. But if wife wants sweatpants, wife gets sweatpants.

We did a little spin around the menu and loved almost everything we had. But the pictures aren&#39;t entirely accurate to what you receive. The corn and shrimp dumpling was more of a corn and pea dumpling. And the noodle dish we picked based on a picture didn&#39;t have the same ingredients as what was shown. No biggie, tho because everything was fresh, hot and tasty. 

Service was polite and quick. I&#39;d highly recommend this place and will absolutely come back the next time a Friday night dim sum craving hits."

It&#39;s very contemporary and modern with some well designed decorations featured throughout. However I was hoping that the horrific sanitation practices that run rampant through every Chinatown restaurant would not follow them to their newest location. Sadly, they did.

The bathrooms, while being well appointed, are disgusting. There is a standing puddle of urine in the men&#39;s bathroom surrounding the urinals that extends about 3 feet from the wall. The sink also has no paper towel dispenser, only a forced air dryer which means that the entire counter top is basically an elevated puddle of stagnant water that is difficult to avoid if you&#39;re not very tall. Also the forced air dryer causes water to be blown all over the tile flooring which may be a considerable hazard.

They say that the cleanliness of the bathroom is an indication of the cleanliness of the kitchen. Don&#39;t be fooled by the nice decor. If they can&#39;t be bothered to maintain the conditions in an area that is very public that everyone sees, why would they bother with cleaning the kitchen that nobody sees?

Next time you need your dim sum fix, look no further!  The food is excellent. The facility was beautiful.  The service was efficient and attentive.  I have been to dim sum in LA, Houston and Ohio but never had as smooth wonderful experience as this.  My favorite items were the shrimp crepes, shrimp and scallion dumpling and egg yolk bun.  The price point was reasonable again compared to the other locations I have been.  If I lived in Naperville, I&#39;d come here every couple weeks at least."

The college girl tried to seat us next to a pile of rags sitting at the smoothie bar, but didn&#39;t say much when I asked for another table.
The service was good. The college kids are attentive.

The rice wraps were good, but not as good as NY Chinatown. The wraps were a little more gummy - too much potato starch. They didn&#39;t soak up the soy sauce. 
The chive dumplings had only a sprinkle of chives. I thought they were scallions. We&#39;re used to the dumpling being 75% chives. Here, it was 90% shrimp. Shouldn&#39;t have ordered Har Gaw, over kill on the shrimp.

Overall ok, and a nice step away from the regular greasy fan fare of American food."

Granted, it was 4:30pm on a weekday, but it was opportune to take advantage of their 20% off pricing from 2:30-5:00pm Mon - Fri.  This discount looks to apply across all of their menu offerings and not just dim sum.  Like its predecessor business, Ginger and Garlic, the space here is huge and comfortable, and elegantly decorated in contemporary style.  I counted 5 eating areas, each a little different.  They look to have dismantled the previous private dining rooms to make the place even more spacious. The front and back areas are more sunny with windows, and the two middle areas are interior and have no natural lighting.  Dim sum was quite decent but not quite up to the tip-top quality of the flagship Chinatown location - possibly just from less traffic flow and associated food prep.  Prices are also a little higher here not surprisingly.  Overall, great stop for Chinese if way out westward.  Also a nice special events venue for a large gathering."

I was simply amazed by how gorgeous the location was designed and how the tables are set up. 

The reason I made this a four star review was the service. When we ordered our food, we ticked with a check what we wanted, so there couldn&#39;t have been any possible communication error. However, when we got the receipt with our food, they ordered the wrong item. We informed the server and he fixed it for us so that was nice. However, the wrong ordered food still came to our table, so we were very confused and just decided to eat that instead. The server came over and addressed the issue and we clearly said that we were fine with what we ordered and we don&#39;t need the other item. When we were in the middle of eating, she brings out the corrected order item and charges us for it! It made me and my friend kinda upset because we said clearly we didn&#39;t want the other food item. We just brushed it off and enjoyed everything else.

I did give them a second chance and they did much better in terms of service so I am very happy about that! Definitely would recommend to come here."

The pork belly literally melted in our mouths, and I highly recommend getting this dish as it is worth eating.

We ordered mostly off their dim-sum dishes. The duck was very fatty, tough to chew, and a lot of bone. It&#39;s like the scraps left over from Chinatown. Maybe it was just the hype, but I felt really let down by this place. My Caucasian friend absolutely loved it though. Go figure. I&#39;ll give it another shot.

My first issue has to do with a severe food allergy. I told the waiter my allergy. The waiter expressly recommended a dish, and said yes, there is none of the food I am allergic to in it. I ask him again to make sure, since there isn&#39;t an English description I can refer to. I took a bite of the dish, and there is the food I am allergic to. I am furious, and suffer an allergic reaction and all the pain that comes with swelling hives. 

The meat in some of our dishes was dirty. The crab had a lot of blood left on it, like this dried blood on the leg meat inside. And the pig&#39;s feet or st had a lot of hair or whiskers. Not properly cleaned. 

The flavor of the food does not taste good. Several of the dishes were much too salty. 

The place was a circus when I went there. A table full of kids were spinning the lazy susan, faster and faster, over the course of their dinner, and empty dishes flew off of it and broke all over the place. 

It was just awful. Informing the manager while we are eating does not do anything. Well, maybe a lawsuit will. The decor is beautiful, but the employees appear miserable, and I saw every bit of that in the food and training. 

Buyer beware guys."

So I made a conscious effort to get some! I was looking for a place known for dim sum and came upon MingHin Cuisine in chinatown. But then I realised they have a new location in Naperville and the stars aligned! With Dim Sum, a lot of the options have pork in them and it was difficult to find something that had only chicken or veggies but I found a couple. Started with the creamy crab corn soup, then got the shrimp pea tip, chicken fried pot sticker, egg yolk paste bun and salt and pepper shrimp. The egg yolk paste was really interesting, I was surprised when I took a bite that it was sweet. I wish the waitress at MingHin was more helpful. We told her that it was our first time there and first time trying dim sum and she told us &#34;don&#39;t order what you have never had&#34; or something along those lines. Basically she didn&#39;t want us trying something new incase we returned it for not liking it. It was a total turn off from the place. It would&#39;ve been a different experience if the waitress was helpful and wanted to guide us. I will be trying dim sum again but probably at a different establishment."

The interior is very classy, modern, bright, and clean. There&#39;s a ton of staff running around everywhere.

Dim sum all day, woohoo! More places should offer this luxury. 

We ordered the usual... I don&#39;t remember the names, just the pictures. All were pretty good. We got the bbq pork bun, shrimp crepe, turnip cake, shrimp dumpling (I do not like this one), udon noodles (meh, wouldn&#39;t get this again), and the roasted duck (super moist and delish! But very greasy). 

They allowed us to bring in our own birthday cake and gave us the supplies to eat it which was super nice. Overall, great experience! I wish they took reservations though!Thanks for the chat today!

The service was really bad - not all staff is not fluent in English and it&#39;s hard to get a message across. They have this weird system, of sticking the order ticket on your dining table and the staff comes around to peep into it all the time interrupting your conversation at dinner table. It&#39;s just weird.

Both the quantity and quality of food was good. The lunch items come withyour choice of egg roll or crab rangoon. I ordered shrimp and vegetables and it was very delicious.

The menu combines traditional Chinese-American restaurant choices with more authentic Chinese dishes, noodle-house cuisine and - my favorite - Dim Sum. This is a separate menu, from which you can order small plates in a wide variety of flavors and styles. Dim Sum is often a Sunday-brunch-only item, but MingHin has it available all the time! The decor is light, open and modern (very different from the older buildings in Chinatown), and the service is quick and courteous, overcoming a little language barrier (many of the staff are Chinese-speaking) with energy and enthusiasm. MingHin also does excellent take-out. Strongly recommended!"

The building is huge so even though it was packed on a Sunday night they found a table for us right away. In addition to being big, the building is really beautifully decorated. 

All the food we got was really good, though we ordered way too much of it. 4 dim sum plates, a noodles plate, and a vegetable turns out to be a lot of food for two people. Their egg yolk buns were amazing, you should definitely try those. There can be a bit of language barrier, so I think we ended up getting one thing we didn&#39;t ask for, but that was ok because it turned out to be our favorite one. If you eat here a few times, you&#39;ll find you own favorite menu items, but from what we&#39;ve seen so far its all really great"

Or at least, the last decade+ that I have lived in Naperville???? I&#39;m SO GLAD that we FINALLY have a yummy dim sum restaurant here in town! Ditto for all of the wonderful comments from everyone says about the dim sum, but the dinner/entree dishes are nothing to smirk about. Unfortunately when we went the restaurant was extremely busy and they were out of fresh prawns, and so instead we ordered the Salt &amp; Pepper Shrimp. Delious!!! The West Lake Minced Beef Soup was also tasty. We also ordered several other dishes, and of them the only one that even fell a bit short was the Salty Fish &amp; Chicken Fried Rice that seemed to lack some flavor. I guess the chef didn&#39;t have a chance to dip his finger in to sample it, not that it didn&#39;t have a good taste, but there just wasn&#39;t enough seasoning.

What I did notice was thay the service was spotty. Some employees were eager to please and gave good customer service while others just stood around waiting (or maybe hoping) that another employee would do their work for them.

For people who don&#39;t speak Chinese, there are pictures on the menu that help me pick out my dim sum favorites.  The restaurant its self is impressively bright and clean.  I definitely recommend it.  Groups of 3-6 are idea because you can try a larger variety of things.

2. Miss the overhead soft jazz of the previous establishment. 

3. Customer service is a bit slow and chaotic. A family that appeared to be seated well before me hadn&#39;t received tea or water by the time my first dim sum dishes came out. I wasn&#39;t offered any beverages other than the tea and water already on the table. I had to ask for napkins and straws. No silver was offered throughout the entire meal. Fortunately, I know how to work a pair of sticks. 

4. The dim sum was an embarrassment to the original location. My fried shrimp spring rolls were pedestrian, the pork dumplings were too greasy, and I couldn&#39;t stomach the texture of the shrimp dumplings. I&#39;ve never had them in whatever wrapper was used. It&#39;s almost like they were stranded and then resteamed into a mushy gelatin. 

5. For an entree, I must&#39;ve asked for candied chicken, because my sweet and sour chicken was way too sugary. I&#39;ve had better at panda express. The fried rice was bland. 

6. For the price (all the food I mentioned above - $35), this was a reasonable meal.

I used to work in this building when it was Casa Lupita many moons ago.  Nothing resembled the place I worked at. It was totally transformed into a very bright and large space with a few different areas to sit.  We arrived at 6:30pm on a Saturday and the parking lot was full. We grabbed one of the two spots left in the huge parking lot. Luckily, we made reservations and were seated within 5 minutes. Our table was large and the big square wicker chairs comfortable. The noise level was loud with the crowd and it was difficult to hear (and understand) our busboy and server, Sandy, but she was sweet and attentive, always checking on us. After reading reviews, my husband and I decided to have a dim sum dinner. I came prepared with a list of some of my fellow Yelpers fav dishes to try. The dim sum menu is a large placemat size two-sided menu with photos and you mark which items you desire. They come out in no particular order. The other menu had typical Chinese cuisine from potstickers to udon to rices to chicken, pork, beef and seafood entrees. So we ordered six items. We had the crispy pork belly, which had a thin very crispy and flavorful crust with the fatty pork underneath.  The fried squid turnovers had a very light tempura batter, but the squid was very stringy, chewy and were saturated in grease.  The fu-kin fried rice was delicious and was plentiful. It had the best sauce and was served piping hot. I will definitely get that again. The pork BBQ bun had shredded and flavorful pork surrounded by a slightly sweet white bread dough. Very good. The sui-mai dumplings were a miss for me. The pork and shrimp inside the dumplings were a jelly-like textured matter and did not taste good.  We ended with the egg custard tart. The tart was a light flaky shell filled with a not too sweet egg custard inside. I liked it. I would have had a cocktail or glass of wine with my dinner, but no drink menu was offered. I didn&#39;t see a bar when I was brought to my table so I thought maybe Minghin didn&#39;t offer alcohol. Upon checking their website once I returned home, I discovered they do have special cocktails, wine, smoothies with tapioca among other beverages. Next time, I will ask to see a drink menu.  For the six items we ordered including the tea and tax, our bill came to just under $38. Very reasonable and I walked away with a full tummy. When we left, the waiting area was wall to wall people. The food seemed very authentic and the clientele added to my feeling that it was authentic Chinese cuisine. Most of the tables were large circular tables with a lazy Susan so coming with a group is ideal. I will definitely come back and try other buns and dumplings on the dim sum menu and try a some items off the main menu as well."

One of the few places sub-locally that serve snow pea tips. If they served soup dumplings, then it&#39;d be a 5. It&#39;s just not dimsum without soup dumplings. 

I found the decor to be a little...fobby. A little mismatched. I think they put a lot of effort into it but just missed the mark. When I sat at a table in the &#39;hallway&#39; area, I developed a legit headache and motion sickness from the combination of lighting and slatted room dividers. That has never happened before, and I&#39;m still baffled by it. Fortunately, they have a huge space and each room is a little different.."

Nice to have a Minghin Cuisine in Naperville.  The food is pretty much the same as the Chinatown location.  Just like the original one in Chinatown, there are long waits to get in if you don&#39;t have a reservation.  Our group of 3 waited almost 1 hour for a table on a Sunday at 12:30.  Like the other locations, this one has unusually nice, modern decor for a Chinese restaurant.  The Naperville location sports vaulted ceilings and a lot of natural light - something that requires not only that the food looks good but that the tables, place settings, floor, etc. - are all clean.  Mostly, the place looks very clean and fresh so kudos to the management on this.  Service is generally friendlier than the Chinatown location, no doubt to cater to suburban sensibilities.

We tried an array of the usual stuff and all were pretty good, and all were piping hot which is really a plus.  Particularly good were the shrimp dumplings, pan-fried chive dumplings, Macao-style roasted pork belly, chicken feet and the steamed beef tripe.  The pan-fried rice noodle roll in XO sauce is awesome.  The baked egg yolk bun is delicious - is it sweet or savory? - who knows but it&#39;s really, really good.  Less successful were the steamed spareribs in black bean sauce - show me the beans! - and the turnip cake - where&#39;s the turnip?"

The fried udon with bbq duck is a tasty favorite. The crab rangoons are also delicious - generously filled. And the egg custard tarts with the creamy custard filling and the flaky crust is a nice end to the meal.

For a building that has been 20 different restaurants in my lifetime located in Naperville, this is pretty great. The restaurant is very nicely decorated and has a sophisticated but traditional Chinese look.  There are tons of tables, so even with a packed parking lot for a weekday lunch, we got a table fast. 
The service is not amazing, as others have noted. I didn&#39;t realize at first that the protocol is to mark the quantity of items off on the picture menu sort of like at a sushi bar.
For two of us, we ordered 5 items.  My favorites were the BBQ pork buns and the shrimp dumplings. Both were flavorful, delicate, and and served quickly. Those 5 items were enough for us, and at $32, I was full, happy, and looking forward to another visit."

Sure, the selection may not be as wide as what you&#39;ll find at their Chinatown restaurant, but I think its enough to satisfy 99% of their customers. All of the dim sum dishes were very good to excellent. My favorites were the deep fried taro puffs and the beef tripe with ginger and onions (this was really the best I&#39;ve ever had anywhere). My only quibbles were with the deep fried shrimp rolls (tasty, but the cigar-sized rolls were too small, perhaps ok as an hors d&#39;oeuvres), and the spare ribs in black bean sauce (again, tasty but sliced into pieces too small). The service was very efficient. We&#39;ll definitely be regulars here."

2nd visit: went there for lunch with coworker, on 2nd day of Chinese New Year, at 12:30, got immediate seating. We were placed at a table large enough for 10. I am very impressed! Very positive experience. 

Food taste was excellent.

3rd visit: Feb 13, 1:30pm, wait time 30 min. This time there were empty seats for us to sit down. And they kept to the wait time. Good! Got a spacious booth with a view, and A/C socket nearby, good for people who need to work on a laptop. 

We ordered about 20 items from the Dimsum menu. Liked their crystal sugar bowl. Most restaurants would only give a small dish of crystal sugar, this place uses a large chrome cup. I like this.

I was kind of nervous because I am not very familiar with this cuisine, style and how dim sum works. We ended up chatting with a gentleman, while waiting for our table, who has been coming to this restaurant every week since it opened! He said it is some of the best Chinese food he&#39;s ever had AND said its comparable if not better then a majority of restaurants in Chinatown. That&#39;s a bold statement if you ask me haha. He did give us some great suggestions for dinner. 
Our waitress was very nice and patient with us through the whole evening. I would definitely recommend the dim sum options especially if it&#39;s your first time here. It&#39;s a great way to get to try out a wide variety of dishes.  Overall we had a very enjoyable evening and I plan on coming back!

Came here for a quick dinner as my hotel is nearby.  I was pleasantly surprised.   Had I read the reviews on Yelp ahead of time, I wouldn&#39;t have been surprised.   Staff is friendly and attentive.  Service is fast.  Decor is new, airy, and modern.  And most importantly, the food is great.   

I usually have a low expectation going to any Chinese restaurants in suburbs.  Just don&#39;t know what to expect.  Food is often westernized to a point where it is hardly Chinese anymore.   Not that there is anything wrong with that, if westernized Chinese food is your thing.  :-)   The food Minghin serves has a high level of authenticity.   I ordered the Fu-kin [insert jokes here as you wish] fried rice and spicy beef tripe.  The fried rice is a simple enough dish that is hard to screw up, but it is also hard to make it well.  Minchin&#39;s version is done right.   The spicy beef tripe is probably a lesser known appertizer to most people but it was awesome.  Right level of spice and flavour.

Didn&#39;t have dim sum as dim sum is usually considered as breakfast/brunch/lunch, but the pictures on the menu look quite good.  They also have the classic Cantonese BBQ.  Will definitely try these next time.

This is Cantonese food done right.  Can&#39;t wait for my next visit."

Interesting that the egg rolls and crab Rangoon here are &#34;hard fried&#34; - as in VERY dark, which is fine with me, but if you don&#39;t like that, be aware.

Everything was really good and service was friendly. It does get really crowded to expect a long wait, especially if you are going during peak meal times.

The pie was excellent...that &#39;s coming from a pizza snob.  It was as good as any thin crust in the Chicago area.  The crust is much like a NYC thin crust, not John&#39;s which you have to fold, but more like the original Rays. I think it would be better if the bottom was seasoned and charred a little.  

I come in to pick up my pie and an attractive silver haired lady is talking to Louie about family and food, and as she is about to leave she turns and says to me,

I was not disappointed. It was a high quality gyro with amazing flavor cooked perfectly. Next time I&#39;ll ask for a little more sauce, but that&#39;s just preference. Between the gyro and what the owner says he&#39;s going to do with the place I will be back for many lunches to come. The pizza looked good too, and he said that he kept the previous owners recipe.

He is so kind and passionate about his little take-out restie.  Just scarfed down two pieces of a 16 inch sausage, onion an and mushroom pie!  OMG, I didn&#39;t get when other reviews said how fresh everything was but yep, it is so fresh.  I could taste the mushrooms, the onions and the sausage.  It was delicious!  

I will be back for sure for another pizza and to try his gyro.  This is the real deal.  The sauce on the pizza, the cheese and ingredients were super fresh and so damn good.  He makes everything from scratch and you will taste the love for sure!

Go here Yelpers!  This place is awesome and next time I am ordering his deep dish or double dough.  The thin crust was absolutely delish!  I love this place and the owner.  I have never met a kinder restaurant owner."

Since moving to Naperville, we have tried a bunch of different places, but hadn&#39;t found one we really liked yet.  This is it!  We have been getting a pizza with various crust types (gotta sample a few :) ) with gyro meet, mushrooms and olives.  It&#39;s delicious!  Perfectly cooked every time.  I am looking forward to trying some more of their offerings.

We call in our order and get delivery.  It&#39;s usually there within a half hour (we live pretty close).  They have coupons available if you order directly through them instead of GrubHub."

1) The cheese on my garlic bread was barely melted. I had to throw it in the broiler for another five minutes...isn&#39;t the point of delivery that I don&#39;t have to cook? Please note... It&#39;s all on one side because it wasn&#39;t cooked enough and stuck as one glob instead of on each half of the bread.
2) I&#39;m pretty sure the garlic spread is the same stuff I buy at the grocery store (and have in my fridge)...again, I&#39;m pretty sure I could have made this myself.
3) I asked for my pizza to be well-done. In my opinion this means I would like the pizza cooked longer so that it&#39;s nicely browned...that is NOT what I received so THAT TOO...under the broiler.
4) my pizza arrived in SLICES??? We live in Chicago...it&#39;s called Chicago cut for a reason. 

I&#39;m guessing those of you who love this pizza are East Coasters...

There are MUCH better places for thin crust pizza here in Naperville..."

The GrubHub selection in our area is pitiful, and seems to be getting worse by the week. Our usual pizza place has failed us miserably on our past two orders, so the hubs and I were eager to give Louie&#39;s a try. After a bit of debating, we decided on our &#34;usual&#34;; a large thin crust with pepperoni and black olive. 

Our order arrived about 30 minutes later, and we immediately dug in. The cheese was perfectly melted and stringy when we pulled pieces apart. The pepperoni was amazing and the sauce was NOT sweet, thank god. As for the crust, it was a nice combo of hard yet chewy.  This had to be one of the best pizzas we&#39;ve had in a long time.

They also offer Italian Beef sandwiches, gyros, and pastas.  I look forward to trying many of their menu items. The best part is that the prices are very reasonable. Louie&#39;s exceeded our expectations and will probably be our new &#34;go to&#34; spot for delivery."

Nice thin crispy crust and flavorful toppings. We got a half sausage half pepperoni and our second was was the louie special. Both were delicious. I will definitely be ordering from here again. Pictures will follow on subsequent review.

UPDATE: I have now eaten here several times and have decided that this is the best pizza in Naperville (that I have tried). It&#39;s flavorful and just the right texture. It&#39;s my go to pizza place. The reason I didn&#39;t upgrade it to 5 stars is because 1, it&#39;s pretty expensive. $30 to have a 16&#34; delivered and 2, the crust is fairly dry. In my opinion if there is going to be a crust around the edge then it should be chewy and fluffy. If the dough is a dry crust (which this is) then I would say put sauce all the way to the edges. The undressed parts aren&#39;t very good. But the actual pizza. I&#39;ll eat that any day."

Knew they were sort of pricey for what you get, so went online to look for coupons.  Coupons were right there on their website.  Called in my order (they answer with &#34;Hello.&#34; - should have been my first clue), with one small change request (take off a meat and add a veggie), no problem (or so I thought).  Told them I had a coupon. They said &#34;it is expired&#34;. I said, &#34;no, I just printed it from your website.&#34; They said that website belongs to the previous owner (clue # 2).  Wanted pizza for the game, so still ordered. Asked for price - about 30% more than shown online (clue 3, but, of course the website belongs to the previous owner).  Pick up pizza and home in time for the 1st pitch. Husband asks if I cancelled all the meat - &#34;no, sausage should still be on there.&#34;  Well, actually that is the one good thing I have to say - there was almost no sausage on the pizza, but that was a good thing, because what was there, was awful.  So I guess the new owners of Louie&#39;s has taken the goat curse from the Cubs - Louie&#39;s will win again! (At least not my order when I am looking for a good pizza.)"

We had a slice of pizza, gyros, mushrooms and chicken strips. 

Let me start by saying the pizza is one of the best I have ever had in the burbs (read my reviews,  I&#39;m very picky about pizza). You can clearly tell everything is homemade in it. The crust is a perfect mix of crispy and doughy. The sauce is a great blend of sweet and savory.

The gyros were perfectly cooked. The bread you can tell is fresh. The meat could not get any better.

The strips and mushrooms were super tasty too. They really do a good job at frying to the perfect amount of crispness.

I highly recommend this place for anyone that wants a quick bite or want some great pizza!"

We were very VERY happy with our meals. Our order consisted of a baked mostaccioli, gyro dinner and a chicken parm sandwich. 

mostaccioli was a very big serving. We ordered it for our girls knowing they wouldn&#39;t eat a big portion anyways but they had seconds and there&#39;s still left overs! My oldest even asked for some leftovers for lunch tomorrow! The red sauce is pretty good too. It&#39;s not overpowering with spices. 

I had the gyro- I&#39;m a sucker for them but I&#39;m also very picky about them. Hands down- best gyro I&#39;ve had in awhile. Even the tzatziki was on point! Only thing I&#39;d change is to ask to have the sauce on the side.

Louie the owner is a kind Greek gentleman with excellent customer service and a passion for good food. I myself have worked in the food business for 20 years and this place is an all around good value. The mostaccioli sauce is different than you&#39;ll have anywhere else and the sauce is a breath of fresh air compared to the sweet garbage sauce most places give you. Like I think he actually chops fresh vegetables for it! Pizza is DELICIOUS and very reasonably priced. One thing to notice is the cheese is good quality. It&#39;s not your typical crappy cheese. One thing I recommend he do though is get some tacos on his menu. If you have a flat top griddle (which I think he does...not sure), tacos are easy to make. I think if he keeps up his quality and doesn&#39;t cut corners to save a buck, he&#39;ll do well. I wish him the best! GO LOUIE!"

The food here is fantastic, and as a bonus the people that run the place are just as great. The owner was working the counter, and he told me about how they make everything from scratch, gave me a dollar off my bill just because, and thanked me profusely for the small take-out tip I left. I joked with my husband after I brought the food home (but before we dug in) that if it was good I would write a nice review, and if it was bad I wouldn&#39;t say anything because the owner was such a nice guy.  Fortunately it was scrumptious, so I did not have to grapple with that moral dilemma. We had a Pepperoni pizza and wings - the crust on the pizza is is thin and crispy but substantial, the sauce is great. The cheese was generously layered and was clearly a quality mozzarella. I was surprised that the hot wings we ordered came naked with the sauce in a container on the side (we got hot and ranch), but this actually resulted in the wings remaining crispy-crunchy in their box. I mixed the two sauces together and dipped, husband just drenched his in our own sriracha and was perfectly happy. We are really looking forward to eating here again. Traffic on 59 stinks, but it&#39;s worth it! As a note, this place is in the same turn-in/plaza as the 7-Eleven, not the Jimmy John&#39;s (they don&#39;t connect)."

When I called to notify them that the chicken (that was paid extra for) wasn&#39;t there, I was brushed off because he was too &#34;busy&#34;!! I was informed they would not bring the chicken back and we could have a free salad any day after. After all of this I did enjoy my Italian beef, so i attempted to order again today to get another beef and the replacement salad. When I called, I was told my order was too small and that it wont be able to be delivered until after one even tho i called at 11:10 am!! I was again brushed off and hurried off the phone and told to call another time for it! HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. After my coworker calls to request the salad for after 1 pm, LOUIE THE OWNER, states to her that this was too much trouble all for $1.50. I am appalled at the way we were spoken to and treated after spending our money and not receiving an item that was paid extra for.

Not much, really.
Everyone knows that the ability to serve food doesn&#39;t exist, although I understand that a kitchen is currently being built.  And the ambiance offers nothing unique or scintillating, and our first waitress (Is it OK to say waitress or do I need to refer to her as a female beverage service technician?) was rather surly, not in a Surly Furious IPA kind of way, and slow, and there is but one electronic beer menu that provides a full listing of the beer offering.  If someone is using it, you&#39;re out of luck and you&#39;ll  be guessing or relying on the staff for a recommendation, which is hit or miss.
I prefer the Beer Market at The Promenade in Bolingbrook where the service is better and the food flows tastily and abundantly, and the beer selection is as good or better."

There are over 50 beers on tap and hundreds more available in can/bottle.  For the ones on tap, you can try before you buy!

It was a fun and relaxing atmosphere.  They even had a live performer singing some cover songs.  Our waiter loved his job and was friendly and knowledgeable about beers.  They don&#39;t serve food here, but you can bring your own or order from tons of places nearby that delivers.

Surly Hell - $7.50 can - I wanted to try Surly Over Rated IPA, but they were out.  The Hell pale lager was a pretty good second choice.  This is one of my favorite brewery, though.  

Penrose Fractal - $4 - I&#39;m not a huge IPA fan, but this one was great!"

World of Beer has an ever changing beer list and the sheer selection is hard to find elsewhere. That said, they&#39;re a touch pricy and you need to make sure you have the menu with the correct date; I was somehow given the wrong one and they didn&#39;t have the beer I wanted.

Our server was nice, however one thing I must note is she didn&#39;t write down orders. With a party of five and craft beers with long names, I found it off-putting. One of the beers wasn&#39;t as described and I can&#39;t help but immediately think we just got whatever since she never actually wrote our order. If you&#39;ve got a one or maybe two person party, fine. But five people and multiple other tables, you really should be writing  orders.

I do plan to return to see how much their selection changes, and to try the food."

I have been here several times and every single time has been great. They have tons of different beers, ciders, and fruit beers. They have Three Floyds Gumballhead, which makes me happy. The waitresses tend to their areas well and the wait isn&#39;t terribly long. It&#39;s a similar place to the Beer House in Lombard. You can order food from places nearby and they will deliver food. Ordering from the actual pub/restaurant is better, but I guess they have a good thing going for them.

I recently hosted a bachelorette party there on a Saturday night. We got there early, but didn&#39;t need to make a reservation (though I didn&#39;t ask either). We all ordered several drinks and she got a good tip. Our server was friendly and prompt with her service.

They had a band playing (really just a guy and a guitarist). Only downside to the band, he only sang guttural songs from bands like Nickelback or Creed. Um, no thanks. I prefer a true acoustic set. Or, any other bands other than Nickelback or Creed."

Expansive beer list? Check. Loud atmosphere at times? Check. Small place, bring your own food, and crappy parking during peak hours? Check, check, check. Moving on.

We first experienced WOB way back in June 2012. Being avid beer fans, this place was right up our alley. We signed up for the loyalty club which in turn gave us some t-shirts, and by downloading the app we were able to keep track of all the beers we&#39;ve tried. Some personal favorites include Small Town Brewery&#39;s &#34;Not your father&#39;s root beer&#34;, Kona&#39;s &#34;Longboard&#34;, Dark Horse &#34;Red Raspberry&#34;, and Great Divide Hades ale (yeah, I stick to the lighter side mainly). If you&#39;re undecided about what to try, the bartenders and servers will suggest something for you. Don&#39;t come here expecting to grab a Miller Lite or Budweiser. You might just get laughed at.

The &#34;Beer Book&#34; is pretty amazing; not only does it contain pages and pages of beers, but it also educates you on the different styles of beer and is full of fun tidbits to read up on. Personally, I want one even though the beer selection changes. It&#39;s just something I&#39;d like to have.

It&#39;s definitely not cheap to drink here, unless of course you&#39;re one of those disciplined types that only drinks one beer and calls it a night. The BYOF kind of sucks. Usually I&#39;ll eat either before or after visiting for convenience sake. The crowd is a lot better than those that hit up downtown Naperville, which is a plus. Seating can be scarce at times and service is hit or miss. They have multiple t.v.&#39;s and I&#39;ve been here a handful of times during Blackhawks games and baseball playoffs, but I don&#39;t recommend it. It&#39;s nearly impossible to find a seat, let alone getting a drink. 

World of Beer would probably be a five star for me if they were in a bigger facility and offered a bit of food. No big plates, just some apps and finger food would be great. I wish I could visit more often, but these days it&#39;s just not in my budget. Nonetheless, WOB is a great place to experience many different kinds of beer. You never know what might become your next favorite."

No kitchen but you can bring your own food or they have a book full of places that deliver.
I&#39;ll go back here just because I like the atmosphere and when they aren&#39;t out of everything they actually have a great selection of craft beers. I just hope next time I go I&#39;m a little more impressed.

There is easily something for everyone though, and typically more than 1 something at that! It definitely took a while to read the options in the menu book, and I&#39;m sure I missed a ton of winners, since you get so distracted with the tons of options.

They don&#39;t serve food, but they have a full book of local options and prices for delivery, which is a welcome tool for those who don&#39;t live nearby. We actually ended up going across the parking lot to a place for food, which is also nice to note that you don&#39;t have to be stuck paying for delivery.

She didn&#39;t write anything down, but brought the right thing every time... they must do a lot of studying in the off hours! She kept checking on us too, so we never had to wait to be served. I will definitely be back!"

I had the best time at World of Beer, mainly because I was drinking awesome craft beers. If that&#39;s your thing, you will love it here too. My fiance and I just finished a 10-mile bike ride at Morton Arboretum and thought to ourselves, &#34;What&#39;s the best way to get back all of those calories we just burned off?&#34; Why, by drinking a lot of beer! Duh.

It was the first day of Chicago Craft Beer Week and World of Beer was featuring a ton of Dogfish Head beers. The CCBW website said the event started at 12. Wrong-o. It actually started at 5, and the bar didn&#39;t even open til about 2 or 3. We were the first people there, and it looked like we had a drinking problem as we waited for the doors to open, looking all sweaty from the bike ride and not dressed very &#34;Naperville-like.&#34;

The bartender was still getting stuff set up so we scanned the taps. I was like a kid in an alcoholic candy store. I think there were about 10 different Dogfish Head beers. For some reason, I always dismissed Dogfish Head, thinking it wasn&#39;t anything special. I can really be stupid sometimes. Their beer is crazy cool. They do such weird stuff. One of the features at the bar was two different Dogfish beers infused with coffee and pineapple, respectively. Who comes up with this stuff? Genius, I tell ya. Once the bartender saw how into beers we were, he came by every once in a while to talk to us about some of their stuff which was cool.

World of Beer also had this beer by Stone that is part of their &#34;Enjoy by&#34; series. It is only available until a certain date. After that, they have to throw it away. It is a double IPA that I can only describe as being slapped in the face with hops. I loved it. Later when the Dogfish event started, pint glasses were passed out. Sweet.

I realize this review was more about beer than the place, but basically World of Beer has amazing stuff that you might not find other places, especially on tap. I don&#39;t even think they have crap domestics, which is a good thing. The place is new and the crowd is great: full of people that love good beer. I&#39;ll definitely be back."

I like this place, but they NEED some live music going in the later hours.  Its not that &#34;happening&#34; of a bar to have no music on!

They DO NOT serve food here, which I kind of like, because then you get to bring whatever food you want!!!  They have a HUGE selection of beers and do give you samples of them if you are unsure.  Our waitress was great at recommending and describing the beers, which I feel is important if you are working at a place like this!!

It is a smaller place and was super busy around 830/9, then died down around 930/10...

This must be the first place that I asked for an Irish Red and got a Pale Belgium Ale served.  I&#39;m trying to get something kinda like Sam Adams&#39; Brick Red (served only in Boston) and this wasn&#39;t even close. 

The fact that they don&#39;t have food served here takes them down a notch. I know you can order a delivery  (or you could bring food in) but it&#39;s not the same as going to a bar and ordering food. Who wants to wait over an hour for a food delivery? 

The Not Your Father&#39;s Root Beer was great but pricey. In fact, everything here is on the high side. I&#39;m not adventurous and stick mainly to my main man, Sam. So all the other micro-brews don&#39;t really interest me. Please stay away from the Brooklyn Lager. That&#39;s the one that was deemed poo (I can confirm since I tasted it too) with John S.

Service was excellent though. You have to kinda stalk out a table if you want to sit down. The place is packed especially on the weekends.

This is okay once and awhile place but definitely not any every weekend to drink. I&#39;ll stick to my plain ol&#39; beers and bars where I can get food ordered out of their own kitchen."

Another challenge was the app did not completely match the inventory, and my initial requests (shown as available on the app) were not found. The service was a little slow too.

Anyway, the service was good...and so was the beer.  I had a cider beer and a root beer beer which I&#39;ve been wanting to try as well.

Okay, no one&#39;s ever called me that... BUT, if someone ever did, I&#39;d be okay with it if I was patronizing the World of Beer.

I personally recommend a flight if you can&#39;t decide on a particular beer (THERE&#39;S SO MANY THERE!)  It&#39;s a great way to try a sampling of unique flavors.  I prefer stouts but you can mix and match different types.  I also really like the fact you can bring food or get food delivered (no delivery charge) from any of the surrounding eateries in the Freedom Commons.  Oh plus, their playlist is a mixture of 90&#39;s bliss!

The only negative would probably be the parking situation.  It may be tough if you get there during the evening hours, but it&#39;ll be worth it for a good time with friends. Just carpool! :)

The waitress was nice and answered our questions.  We had couple round of beers which went great with our sandwiches from Jason&#39;s Deli across the street.

The draft list is impressive, and most beers are $6-7.  I was especially hyped to see Blackthorn Cider (or any cider) on tap.

A group of about 12 of us met here on a Sunday evening.  It wasn&#39;t very busy, but our server later apologized for &#34;the long wait&#34; as she handed us our checks.  I didn&#39;t feel that we had to wait long for our beers at all, but maybe she was worried about a poor tip.  Our server was very attentive and not at all bothered when we kept asking for samples. This is my favorite part of World of Beer, you can sample any draft beer, and it doesn&#39;t appear they limit you.

Back to my cider.  It wasn&#39;t as tart as others, but I was happy with my sample.  I also sampled the Dark Horse Raspberry, which was just OK and not as fruity as I expected; the Sea Dog Blueberry was really good and light with a bold blueberry flavor; the Agave Wheat was, well, yucky.  I just wasn&#39;t a fan.

All of our friends were raving about the root beer.  It&#39;s a beer that tastes like root beer.  I was initially put off by the darkness of this, because I don&#39;t like any dark beers.  I sampled a friend&#39;s and I then immediately ordered this 10% beer that tasted liked liquified root beer barrels.  You absolutely must try this beer!  We had eaten dinner at home prior to coming here, so the root beer was almost like dessert.  Halfway through my beer, I felt a slight buzz.  It&#39;s very filling, so just one beer last night was enough for me.

I agree with other reviewers about the &#34;corporate&#34; feel.  I prefer the ambiance of Bigby&#39;s over World of Beer, but WOB is closer to home for me and has a standout menu aside from the manufactured feel of the place.  It is loud in here, but I was able to somewhat comfortably converse with 4-5 people at our table.  I wouldn&#39;t go here for live music, because it&#39;s not a big place and that would make it impossible to converse with anyone.

BYOF = bring your own food.  A friend brought in some Q BBQ, while other patrons had a pizza delivered from Jet&#39;s."

World of Beer has several craft brews on tap including many hard to find ones. You won&#39;t find bud light or miller light here! If the brews on tap aren&#39;t doing it for you, then surely you&#39;ll find something in the walls lined with fridges housing hundreds of beers from around the world.  Go ahead, try a new one! There&#39;s so much opportunity for adventure, and with the exception of the occasional frat boys that will stumble in, everyone else is there sharing the common love for a good brew.

As far as entertainment goes, there are TVs above the bar, and often WOB has a live band that does a great  job of providing great tunes, without being overly loud to the point where you can&#39;t have a conversation with the person next to you. The bartenders are fast, friendly, and most importantly: knowledgeable. I have yet to ask a beer question that any of the bartenders didn&#39;t know the answer to. 

My lack of a fifth star however lies in the fact that they don&#39;t serve food. This isn&#39;t a deal breaker, and i&#39;m told you&#39;re even welcome to bring in your own food, but some little finger foods would be nice.

If it&#39;s available during your visit, get the root beer beer that they have on tap, it&#39;s delightful!"

They have beers from brewers across the country and around the world.  Don&#39;t know how to choose?  Their staff is extremely helpful and THEY HAVE AN APP FOR THAT!  That&#39;s right, they actually have a World of Beer app that will filter out suggestions based on the types of beer you like and what they have on tap.  Still don&#39;t know what to pick?  I highly suggest trying the &#34;Not Your Father&#39;s Root Beer&#34; from Small Town Brewery.  All the taste of root beer with 10% abv.  Very unique and worth a try!

They usually have a band on Saturday nights so if you&#39;re planning on coming in, come early.  The place begins to fill up around 8 and will be standing room only throughout the night because the tables go so quickly.  You can call to reserve a table, but they only take a limited number of reservations.  Friday nights you won&#39;t have as much trouble finding a table or a seat at the bar.  

Truth be told there is no kitchen at World of Beer, but no worries, YOU CAN BRING IN YOUR OWN FOOD!  You can have food delivered to the restaurant or bring food in with you from home or your favorite carry out destination.

Bottom line, if your love of beer goes beyond the typical domestic brew - this place if for you!"

Pluses: Tons of beers to choose from, all on tap, Major variety and not focused on any one style.  Beer was really fresh, was really happy with it for that.
Negatives: REALLY needs food, or some sort of options.  Kind of awkward seating all around.  Servers needed to come by more often, even though we were the only group there.

It&#39;s not like they hide this fact, I mean, come on! It&#39;s their entire concept, get over it! You can bring in your own food and (n/a) beverages which is awesome, especially when I&#39;m the DD for the night.. There are so many food options around, it&#39;s nice to eat exactly what I want!!

I love their beer selection!! It&#39;s so nice to try something new and not the same 10 beers that every place that boasts a &#34;craft beer menu&#34; has. I love me fact that the bartenders, Dakota, Ben, the man with the beautiful hair (can NEVER remember his name) have beer picked out for me when I walk through the door (they haven&#39;t been wrong yet!) I love sour beers, and they always have a stellar selection.  

The only negative? I can honestly say I haven&#39;t enjoyed any of the bands they&#39;ve had, they&#39;re always too loud for the little space, and honestly aren&#39;t that great. But, a lot of people really enjoy them, so it&#39;s just a personal thing.

Next time you&#39;re in the area, grab some food, grab some friends, head over to WOB, ask for Dakota and enjoy a great brew!!!"

I only heard about this place a week ago. Was there on 12/29 with 2 pals. We sat at the bar and the service was good.  I got samples of 3-4 beers and found one I likes. Another friend wanted wine - minor options available but she found one she liked. 

The place is narrow and it&#39;s loud.  The band plays up in an elevated space so you can see and hear but there is no dancing area. 

The din in the place reminds me of downtown Naperville - most bars there... same tone, just a lot of guys and some gals drinking beer. 

I have to admit I was surprised that people order food from places like pizza parlors and the food is delivered there.   

It&#39;s not a bad place - just sort of depends on what your cup of tea is.  It&#39;s not quite my flavor but it&#39;s not all bad or great either."

The selection of beer is nothing short of awesome. 

I&#39;m not sure why people complain that there&#39;s no food. They&#39;re very specific about it both verbally before you place your order and again in print on the beer menu. Go to any one of 6 places in that strip mall and bring it with. I like how they don&#39;t have food and understand it in a business perspective.

It&#39;s a very casual and relaxed atmosphere and usually has a decent number of people and can get pretty packed in the evenings. If you sit at the bar they will even let you taste a beer before you order it which is a plus since they have over 500 beers to choose from. They have a lot to choose from on tap which is nice and it&#39;s really tasty.

They do not serve food here however, they do have a book of places you can order from and they will deliver - which we&#39;ve done (just make sure they bring napkins, plates, and utensils). It&#39;s not listed in their menus book but in the same plaza they have about 5 or so carry out places that you can pick something up from and bring it with you. 

They have a lot of TVs and stream all sports game.

This is not your regular bar where you can drink 10 beers in one sitting because beers are not cheap and the lowest you will fine is $6 per beer but most cost higher. You will spend some money if you get more than 2 drinks. 

One time i went there they had a VERY LOUD band playing which i did not like because you could barely hear the people talking around you. I would say a band is not needed in a pace like this. There is nobody dancing - and frankly there is no space to dance."

I&#39;m not a tremendous beer snob, so I don&#39;t get offended if someplace doesn&#39;t have an esoteric micro brew that my cousin&#39;s brother-in-law swears is the best beer ever.

In other words, I can almost always find a beer that suits me just fine.  And I expected that a place called World of Beer would easily have a few suitable beers on hand.

True to form, I found several beers that I knew I&#39;d like.  

World of beer was not very crowded when I went this past weekend, but part of that is maybe due to the fact that it&#39;s in sort of a &#34;weird&#34; part of Naperville.  It&#39;s in a new&#39;ish strip mall sort of section that is surrounded by mostly office buildings and close to a Marriott hotel.

Anyway, the beer is plentiful, the service is fine, the music is a bit too loud, and the food does not exist.  You can order food from restaurants that are close by and have it delivered if you&#39;d like.  At least I was told that you could do that so I assume they weren&#39;t lying to me.

I would go back to grab a beer or two, but I wouldn&#39;t consider this a destination spot for the evening."

No food but who cares? I like that they focus on one thing and do it well. Food just gets in the way of more beer anyway.  My tip is come at happy hour, the place is pretty slow and you can really explore the World of Beer with a dedicated bartender. My one complaint:  when they have bands playing its just too loud. I like a little conversation in my World of Beer not music so loud I can barely think. The setup fo the room and acoustics just doesnt lend itself to loud music.

Dollar beers. Craft brews. Free tiara.

This is my kind of place to watch the clock strike midnight on NYE.

Casual sports bar in a suburban plaza is not my typical choice for such a night. However, my husband and I recently moved to the area and have been wanting to try it out. Not to mention, we are total beer enthusiasts and have heard of the rotating selection of more than 20 on tap.

When we sat settled into the comfy leather bar stools and positioned ourselves in front of the TVs for the countdown, our server immediately informed us of the specials: Bottles of Christmas craft beers from Lakefront in Milwaukee, Breckenridge in Colorado, Anchor in Cali and Goose Island in Chicago - $1 each. I had to do a double take and ask him to reassure us this was truth. 

I seriously almost hugged the guy. 

I love these winter brews for the spices reminiscent of the holiday season - cinnamon, clove, honey, brown sugar, etc. Plus these are hearty for the cold winter weather - stouts and brown/dark ales. My fav out of the four was the rich-flavored Anchor (which my hubby and I had actually recently shared the giant bottle size with friends when visiting in Michigan).

Then, icing on the cake: We got more beer for free to toast with the rest of the bar&#39;s patrons! 

Plastic champagne glasses filled with North Coast PranQster&#39;s Belgian style pale ale mimicked the color and light smoothness of the traditional NYE drink. In addition to the free drink, customers got free noisemakers and hats or tiaras. My tiara even matched my outfit.

I LOVED the time we had here, so I am only hoping when we come back on a normal day, it is just as enjoyable of an experience!"

At first I thought it was like a fancy beer store of some sort. It&#39;s actually a bar, which serves beer, beer, and more beer (there is a wine list, too, but I don&#39;t know why you would be drinking wine at a place called World of Beer).

My husband and I visited on Sunday with a friend who had been there many times before and insisted we try the Small Town Brewery Not Your Father&#39;s Root Beer. This is a dark beer with a sweet, fizzy, complex root beer flavor and it took one sip for me to become totally obsessed; it is a must try! I was glad to have this suggestion as a starting point because the menu here is insane. Even limiting myself to what was available on tap, I had a hard time choosing!

The atmosphere on Sunday was comfortable and relaxed and our waitress was really nice and let us try as many samples as we wanted. You can even order or bring in food from any restaurants in the area (they have a list in the back of the menu of places which will deliver at no additional charge, including my beloved Naf Naf), which I am totally trying next time. I wonder what beer to pair with hummus and falafel."

I&#39;m a stout kinda girl so I like my Left Hand Milk Stout Nitro. If you&#39;re a root beer lover like myself, do try the Small Town Brewery Not Your Father&#39;s Root Beer. It is delicious!! Don&#39;t worry, it is very alcoholic. It&#39;s 10.0% so don&#39;t have too many of those...The prices here are your average Chicagoland pricing.

One nice thing is that you can bring your own food or order food from the area and have it delivered. Also, the wait staff is pretty nice.

There is one downside. The parking sucks. There&#39;s a parking lot but it&#39;s always full. I suggest just carpooling with friends."

Middle of October and they have no Pumpkin beers on tap or in the bottle.  &#34;I guess we are all sold out&#34; was the server&#39;s response.  A big problem is the staff at world of beer does not really know about beer.  Two glasses of Lagunitas had at least a 3 inch head and after I specifically asked for the second one to be poured different.  

The boss was there and ordered the Chimay Blue and the server dumped the whole thing into the glass like he was emptying a ketchup bottle.  This beer is fermented in the bottle and you pour it and leave a finger of beer in the bottle to avoid the having a floating yeast party in the glass.

The other big problem is the lack of food on premise.

Rather casual, great amount of beer selection, but I will warn that there is absolutely no food service.  Drinking establishment only.  The will let you order a pizza from across the street and have it delivered, but that&#39;s about it.

The beer selection is everything from foreign to domestic, saison to IPA.  I was also shown a phone app to help track what beers they have.  They keep about 25 beers on tap and another 400 or so bottled.  I wouldn&#39;t call it a trendy place, but people there always seem to be having a good time.

My only knock about the place is the volume of the live music on the weekends.  It seems the worse the band is, the louder they turn up the volume.  At one point it was impossible to hear what someone was saying unless it was shouted directly into your ear."

Positives:
Great beer selection
Free samples

On the negative side, the place is extemely loud, even without the band.  2 of bottled beers I requested were out of stock.  I was overcharged and when I asked about it, it took another 15 minutes to get it corrected.

I also don&#39;t like the policy of giving a credit card up front to start a tab.  I know it&#39;s somewhat common at higher end places in Chicago, but it&#39;s annoying to me.

To me, this is inexcusable for somewhere that claims to be a &#34;world&#34; of it. Why does somewhere like The House Pub in Saint Charles have more to offer? 
That aside, this place is a nice place to go for a good brew if you&#39;re around Naperville. They have exceptional service and amazing promotions during Bears games (which might translate into baseball season... we&#39;ll see.) Part of me wishes they served some type of food here, even small plates, but the policy of bringing your own food in might do more than supplement it if you plan ahead."

The first issue was mainly of my friends, not mine. I went with a group and we are all internationals so we were joking that we were going to all get beer from where we were originally from and see who had the best beer (I am from Germany, my friends couldn&#39;t compete anyway!).
A lot of beer they had listed was not available i.e. they had never received it. There were also some prominent countries that were left out. The Filipino was a bit more obviously sour that there were no beers from where he hailed. So in all honesty, the selection is a lot of Germany beers &amp; I.P.A., then a few solid Japanese beers.

It is also an extremely loud place. This place really isn&#39;t set up for dancing like other famous dance/bar haunts in Naperville i.e. Rizzo&#39;s, Black Finn, Bar Louie, etc. So I really don&#39;t understand why the music was so loud. I was hoarse by the time we left because I had to yell just to talk to my friends and we were only there for an hour and a half at the mostl

I also think they should at least offer appetizers or snacks, it is strange to me a bar doesn&#39;t offer at least some sort of pub food. However it is a nice perk that you get to bring in whatever you want, though I have yet to take advantage of that perk.

I never had an issue with rude staffing, but it is something I hear complained about a lot. The only person I have ever talked to is the bartender and I always had a guy with an afro. He was very friendly and offered samples of anything on tap that we desired.

It is worth going to, I mean there is a severe lack of choice in the suburbs, and I can at least get a Koelsch here!"

It&#39;s good that they support local businesses!

I think this place will fair well for people who are not super-knowledgeable on what beer they like. They have a club which gives you incentives to try new brews, which I like. Plus I love how their menu is laid out...it describes all the beer styles and categorizes them for you.

I wish they offered up some pretzels and cheese or something!"

The interior has a very corporate/ chain feel to it.  Lots of TVs and dark wood - the seating configurations are a little confusing and maybe don&#39;t lend themselves exactly well for small groups of people to converse.  I can imagine it is very hard to get around the place if it&#39;s more full than it was this evening.  Some kind of tight spaces.

It&#39;s also very loud - we came in right after work and the volume level was excessive for three people to have a conversation comfortably without the end people needing to sit in the middle person&#39;s lap to hear each other a lot of the time.  They have live music so you may want to check the schedule if you have a notion of actually hearing your companions.

The servers are friendly and did make some good recommendations, which was nice.  They were also fairly patient while we got situated.  

The selection is large so unless you have a plan ahead of time, it is going to take you a few moments to make your choice.  We are talking hundreds of beers or every kind you can imagine from all over the world - this is not your basic Miller or Oldstyle establishment, to be sure.  It&#39;s nice to be able to try some new stuff and, apparently, which we did not realize, you can sample the wares before you buy, which we will keep in mind if we do decide to go  back again.

There is no food being served here so if you&#39;re hungry, there is actually a blurb in the menu that tells you to call various location to deliver to WOB. Or bring your own.  Weird concept but it&#39;s called World of Beer, not World of PBJ, right?  We did see Papa Johns being delivered to the bar while we were there - definitely a little odd.

All in all, not bad."

I&#39;m very happy that their&#39;s another place to drink good beer nearby.  The servers and bartenders are very friendly and patient.  On my first visit on a Tuesday night, my wife tried a few different samples before settling on finishing my beer.  The server didn&#39;t seem to mind at all.  Neither did I.  It allowed me to try another beer on their extensive list of drafts.  Some of the beers can be found at several other bars or at Binny&#39;s, but there were also some that are difficult to come by.

My second visit was on a Saturday evening.  I went specifically because they had Firestone Walker Parabola on tap, which is not the easiest beer to find.  While there, a live band started to play.  They actually weren&#39;t bad.  During both visits, I ordered food from Naf Naf (across the parking lot) and they brought it right over to me.

There are two things you should keep in mind.  It is a bit loud in there, but its a bar not a lounge.  If you&#39;re looking to have a quiet conversation, then this is not your place.  Also, some of the beers can be pricey, but if you peruse the menu there are also some deals to be had.

I will definitely be back!"

If you want a great selection of bottled beers, go here. Their draft selection is very good too, but I wouldn&#39;t say other-worldly. I went on a Monday night, so I will need to return to confirm this, but I liked the atmosphere. Very chill but friendly. I will admit it is a bit of a franchise feel, but I didn&#39;t find it overwhelming. 

The problem is a simple one: cost. I am never opposed to spending more on good beer. I wouldn&#39;t be a beer snob if I was. However, having had these beers before, I know what they should cost and everything here is at least a buck more than most other places. It may not sound like a lot, but it adds up quickly. And I might be ok with it if I knew it was locally owned and that&#39;s what I was supporting, but not at a chain. 

Overall, I am sure I will return, but this won&#39;t be a regular spot for me."

I went back and forth between 3 and 4 stars but in the end am feeling generous. :)  First of all, the beer list is fantastic.  Since this is a beer venue, that is obviously important.  I also really like that they have local brews on tap, including Solemn Oath and Two Brothers.  Also the service when I went was excellent.  My friend and I sat down and immediately the waitress asked us what kind of beers we like and offered us each three samples in the style beers we suggested.  Free samples -- yes please!  (And since I am still bitter about this, there goes Bavarian Lodge&#39;s weak excuse of having too many beers to give samples!   See my review on them...)  The other positive to the place is that you can bring your own food or order from local places for delivery.  Since Naf Naf is one such place and one of my all time favorite restaurants in Chicagoland, that&#39;s a great deal.

On the flip side, there are a few negatives to the place. First of all, it has a very chain/corporate feel to it, which is always a turn off to me.  Secondly the beers they &#34;feature&#34; are just bizarre.  Leinenkugel Summer Shandy...seriously?!  Any real beer drinker wouldn&#39;t come near that stuff with a 10 foot pole.  I suspect that their &#34;featured&#34; beers are actually paid for by the brewery and &#34;chosen&#34; by the corporate office.  Also, the night that my friend and I went there was a &#34;band&#34; playing that consisted of 2 guys playing Top 40 hits (think Lady Gaga...) which was just odd and not really what I want to be hearing.  Not at all the establishment&#39;s fault, but to up the ante of annoyingness, a group of 20-something guys were standing by our table, fist-pumping and singing along to the music.  Eek...

So to sum it up, I&#39;ll definitely be back for the awesome beer list and great service.  I&#39;ll probably stick to earlier in the evening pre-entertainment and before the place gets too crowded."

Being a Friday night the place was packed. I found the service to be great considering how crowded it was. Our waitress stopped back many times to ask if we needed anything. Service here was top notch. Had a few downsides however. The beer list had few beers that really stood out and felt like they were worth the high prices. The root beer was quite interesting and probably the big surprise of the night. Another Irish beer I had (wish I knew the name) was quickly deemed to be poo water by our table. It was just awful. Also being called world of beer I was expecting beers from all over the world. Well the world to them is Ireland, The us and Germany... Not one Asian beer on tap. Come on really. I wanted something different not Goose Island I can get that at 100 other places. My other complaint was the food situation or lack there of. They don&#39;t serve any... You want food they have delivery menus for other businesses. With the exception of great service can&#39;t find any reason to go back. Plenty of better places to get a drink... Want to try different beers go to the Bavarian Lodge they have a better selection and great food to go with ti."

They have a menu FULL of beer from all &#34;corners&#34; (Earth is spherical) of world, and the servers are always willing to help you out with making a decision on what you should order, which can actually be rather difficult considering how many options they have. 

The only drawback of this place is that it can get VERY loud, especially if they have live music from a local band. From what I hear though, you can order food from wherever you heart desires and eat it in the restaurant along with whatever beer you are drinking, which is quite unique and pretty badass in my opinion.

When the bartender was asked what Irish beer they have -  he responded by saying they had &#34;Harp Crap&#34; and we always have Guinness.  He behaved like it was an intrusion that he was bothered to make a recommendation for Irish beer on St Patrick&#39;s Day. 

 They did not have anything on tap for the day nor do they sell growlers.

Time of my visit: around dinner time

This was my first time there.  My girlfriend works in the area and saw the place.  We decided to try it for dinner. 

Let me start by saying, it is a little pricey, but they are located in Naperville, so I am not that surprised.  In that area everything is overpriced, even McDs.

Let&#39;s get to the food.  I have ordered giant burrito.  Purely on size, probably should not be called that.  I have been to other Mexican joints and that&#39;s about an average size burrito, so that was slightly disappointing.  As for the taste, this was by far one the best burritos I have ever tasted.  I order al pastor and the seasoning and marinate was awesome!  My only complaint was I got a couple of chewy pieces, but it is pork after all.

The server was awesome, friendly and attentive!  The chips kept coming in as we were running out and all of them felt warm, made an impression of just being made to order for us.

Overall, I would say it&#39;s an A-!  Would defiantly be back to try something else"

We ordered delivery from this dump and they sent the soggiest nachos and &#34;crispy&#34; tacos we have ever seen. Not to mention a big ass hunk of garlic and a CARROT sitting on top of the so-called &#34;nachos supreme&#34;. By the way, the only thing that differs between nachos supreme and regular nachos is TWO small pieces of jalapenos. 

Oh, and this is the only Mexican restaurant that delivers in Naperville too stingy to give you A single chip on the side (or anything else) for free.

I would not recommend this restaurant for carryout. I ordered ground beef enchiladas with no sour cream (the ONLY special instruction in an order of only 3 items), but I received chicken enchiladas with sour cream. The queso fundido app, which had been recommended, was sadly underwhelming. The cheese hardened way too quickly, so it was not an actual dip. We kept having to microwave and stir it to attempt to restore it. The enchiladas were pretty good, but the Mexican rice was unusual - it had peas, corn, carrots, and green beans mixed in. The best part of the meal was actually the salsa, which was delicious. Again, maybe the dining-in experience is better, but based on this meal, I won&#39;t be going there to try it anytime soon."

When the meal was served... No tortillas.  (Fajitas without tortillas are about as useful as ...(insert your favorite saying here).  She asked again &#34;corn or flour?&#34; ... then I sat and watched my fajitas sizzle (and the veggies scorch) on the table for a good 3-4 minutes more until they finally appeared.  At which time I reached for the serving spoon resting on the table-top hibachi style grill-plate and almost burned my hand it was so hot from the hot plate!  I soon extinguished the flame underneath the hot plate to keep my food from burning.

As if the food wasn&#39;t disappointing enough, they&#39;re service was even worse! The guy who took our order over the phone was totally rude cutting us off while trying to place our orders. Polite people know to wait their turn, he obviously was not polite the least bit. 

Once my friend picked up our food and got back to work she discovered that one of her three tacos had no meat in it! What kind of bs is that! She immediately called and spoke to them explaining the situation. They did not care to apologize, instead they argued back saying that it was impossible that they didn&#39;t fill the taco! They said they couldn&#39;t do anything about it without taking the food and showing it to them! Unbelievable! My friend actually drove back and showed them.

The atmosphere is typical of a Mexican restaurant complete with mariachi music playing overhead and a giant (GIANT) statue of a well hung bull in the middle of the dining room.  

We arrived around 4:30 and aside from two other patrons, we had the place to ourselves.  By the time we left around 7, business had picked up but only slightly.  Perhaps this was due to the fact that it was a Monday night; in the bitter cold; after Thanksgiving weekend.  The dining room is large and perfect for large groups.  You could easily have a birthday fiesta for 20 here.

The complimentary chips and salsa were good, better than many.  The salsa had a spicy kick to it, so beware if you are sensitive!

I ordered the Chiles Relleno, which were perfectly battered and fried, and oozing with cheese when I cut them open.  I also liked the tomato sauce served atop the peppers.  The dish came with a side of warm corn tortillas.  Entrees come with beans and rice, and I&#39;m always a happy camper when black beans are an option.

My friends all ordered some variation of the tacos, and most had difficulty finishing the large portion.

The food here is very good, but if I want an &#34;ay ay picante!&#34; experience, I&#39;d probably wait until the weekend or go somewhere a bit busier.

The weird part of our meal was when we all had our wallets out, preparing to pay the check.  A young boy, maybe 10-12 years old, approached our table while carrying a box.  He asked us if we wanted to buy chocolate bars.  I&#39;m assuming he was the son or friend of an employee, but soliciting chocolate bars to patrons is so tacky and inappropriate.  I think it would be more appropriate to keep the box of chocolate up at the hostess stand instead of trying to shake down ladies for their dollars at the table."

I ordered a Chicken Fajitas and to my surprise, they brought out a burner with a little grill on top to my table. The food was cooking in this contraption right in front of me. The food was done and sizzling hot. The food smelled so good and it was nice to have it served in such a way to prevent it from getting cold.

The flavor of the chicken, veggies, and corn tortillas was right on the money. The portion was for a single person, but two people could have easily made enough tacos to fill themselves.

I had the cheesecake dessert which was nicely decorated and fresh. The server was a nice lady with dark hair, (I forgot to get her name), and she was very polite. She helped me understand the artwork that was on the wall featuring the sad story of Hern√°n Cort√©s and La Malinche. One painting featured Cortes taking her away in his arms while she was passed out. Another showed her partially dressed, afraid, and the Conquistadors looking at her as a commodity.

The exterior of the building needs a little remodeling, but the inside is cozy. They play Mexican music for the full effect and it looks like the restaurant doubles as a dance floor due to the speakers and light system they have near the ceiling.

My experience at Las Palmas in Naperville was very good. I plan on having lunch there again soon.

Las Palmas can be enjoyed by families or couples, or people on their lunch hour looking for a fun place to eat.

Sleep won out that morning and breakfast had been skipped, so we needed some hearty chow. We ended up here and I&#39;m torn. 

While walking past the Sunday buffet, it was easy to decide that we didn&#39;t want that at all. There weren&#39;t enough people eating there to turn the food over regularly. Instead, we ordered off the menu. Chicken enchiladas with mole and a combination plate. 

The table and floors seemed pretty clean. But the windows were a mess. The place is loaded with windows, but the sun probably doesn&#39;t make its way in because of the streaky windows. 

The chicken and the mole were good. But the rice was overcooked and pretty mushy. 

The glasses were kept full. But on one of the refills, my glass was filled with Diet Coke instead of Root Beer. It took a while to get this corrected and then when it finally was, I received a cracked straw!

With a pretty open restaurant and lots of tables and seats available...my hubs and I get seated all the way in the dark, back left corner of the restaurant next to the exit door. That was okay to us, I guess...but then we sat down and noticed that in front of us...was another table UPSIDE DOWN ON TOP OF ANOTHER TABLE...and next to us...was all of the EMPTY HUGE BUFFET STATIONS lined up on the order side of us. 

Hmmm...ok?

The waitress came, we asked to be seated somewhere else...but she didn&#39;t speak or understand great english bc she said...&#34;oh yes...fine&#34; ummm, does that mean you can move us? &#34;oh yes...fine&#34;...umm ok? She left and said she would be right back.

Needless to say, we sat there...for ten minutes. No water, no chips and salsa...nothing.

She finally came back and asked if we were ready to order...hmmm?

We asked for water, she said...&#34;oh yes...fine&#34;. I mean, I&#39;m not making this stuff up. I LOVE me some mexican food...but this was the worst experience ever!

She came back with water, and the chips and salsa...we said we were ready to order. 

She took our order, and left as we sat and munched on chips and salsa. About 20 minutes later she checks in on us...and ten mins later she brings out the food.

I ordered the Cheese Enchiladas, and the hubs ordered the Chicken fajita&#39;s for one.

The food was...MEH. Honestly, I would have much rather eaten at Taco Bell. Thats how this place made me feel...and I DON&#39;T eat at Taco bell...

So...we&#39;re sitting there eating and needed water refills...but or waitress didn&#39;t come by for another 20 mins to check on us...so when she finally did...we were done eating and asked for the check thinking it would be quick...but why in the world would we feel ourselves into thinking that?!!

Well...20 mins later...no waitress again. So the hubs went to find someone, anyone, our waitress...SOMETHING! Luckily, he came across the manager, explained everything...and was basically told...that the waitress would be right over. We were expecting anything, but at least an apology from the Manager on Duty about the slow service, seating situation...etc. But...nothing.

Finally after waiting another 10 mins...YUP...I said it...ANOTHER 10 MINS...

She came, gave us the bill...we didn&#39;t even look at it...we gave her our card...she came back, we signed. and we left.

The servers are very friendly. The atmosphere is decent but could use an update. The bathroom needs work.

We stopped in at 2pm. During that time not a single item was replenished. The rice and beans were empty for a good portion of that time. As far as buffet food goes it is on par with all the other mexican buffets.   If the buffet food is the same as the menu food then I can say I have had better.  The one redeeming feature of todays visit was the service. Our server was top notch. He came and switched out my drink cause the tea looked old. Also for him being the only server he spent a good deal of time on us. 
So you have been warned."

They wanted something ethnic, but also wanted a buffet because I have a 10 year old brother who can never decide what to eat.

We all ate the buffet except my brother who ordered the Super Nachos off of the menu.  The buffet was pretty great, plenty of meat choices (steak fajita, chicken fajita, some stewed pork, stir fried shrimp, and carnitas cut to order on the line) as well as your typical rice, beans, all the accouterments and both flour and corn tortillas.  I was impressed to see many salsas available, as well as shredded cheese, sour cream, and even guacamole for no extra charge.

I ended up having a few carnitas tacos, one steak fajita, a bowl of menudo, and chips with guacamole and salsa.  I was pleased with the carnitas, which I topped with the available cilantro, onion, and lemon (no limes today).  The menudo was OK, the flavor was a little light but the stomach was cooked wonderfully.  The steak fajita had decent flavor, but tasted like it had probably been sitting on the line a little while.

The nachos my brother ordered looked great when they came out, but overall lacked flavor or pizzaz, for being named Super Nachos. 

The wait staff was pretty attentive to our table, it was not the busy at the time we dined, and they also celebrated two birthdays while we were there, which was very festive and loud.

Overall the fact that there is a Mexican food buffet for those times you&#39;re feeling very indecisive, is a good thing.  BUT if you know exactly what you want, I wouldn&#39;t say this is the place to go and order off of the menu."

Most of the entrees on the menu are in the $10 area, so we decided to truly make it rain with steak fajitas for two and an order of guacamole.

The guac&#39; was fantastic, almost obnoxiously avocado-y, which isn&#39;t a bad thing at all. With the price of avocados at the store, you&#39;re definitely getting your moneys worth. Fajitas were pretty legit too, massive fresh slices of peppers, onion, and steak were accompanied by fresh made tortillas. Oh, and it was elaborately plated on this contraption with its own sterno heater to keep everything hot.

On Sundays they have a crazy buffet which is $10, and it seemed like a substantially better deal than our Groupon, but, whatever. Las Palmas isn&#39;t the best Mexican food I&#39;ve had in the area, but it&#39;s certainly in the upper echelon. Any place that makes their tortillas in house is A-OK in my book.

Definitely check it out if you&#39;re in the area. Also, I&#39;ve heard at night this place turns into a dance club. I have no idea if this is true or not!"

There is a rather extensive buffet hour from 11AM-7PM on sundays when most places only have buffets Monday through Friday. Its a quick and simple solution for my family to get together for brunch  I am rather picky about buffets however their menudo is delicious. Their barbacoa is fresh pulls apart bursting with flavor. Love their mexican rice however I will pass on the refired beans, my mama makes it better.

I love the fact the buffet spread was consistently warm. The staff was on top of replenishing items that went.

Food is way overpriced and I&#39;d bet Taco Bell would win a taste test competition between the two. Mexican food is my favorite food and this place looked so promising!! This is what went wrong:

It was our first time so naturally we had questions and I felt like our server seemed annoyed and/or just busy. So we tried to keep our questions and needs to a minimum. No big deal though as I can overlook that.

I ordered our daughters nuggets first with our drinks because she is 3 years old and it was already 7:45pm. We also ordered the guacamole made table side for an appetizer and the queso bowl. The queso was not even melted it was just a hot block of cheese. I mean, no judgement if that is their thing, but any other Mexican restaurant I&#39;ve been to you could dip a chip in the queso. Here there was no such thing; I needed a fork to eat it. We just sent it back. 

Then the guacamole. A small green glob with chips sticking out of it and was brought out on a side plate. When I told the waiter we ordered it to be made fresh table side the waiter told us &#34;no this is a bigger serving size anyway&#34;...um ok? I guess we will eat and pay for what we didn&#39;t order.... All in all very bland and way too small a portion for $8. The picture on the menu is very deceiving and not what you really get. Bummer.

After the appetizers (or lack thereof), we waited for about an hour for our food to come. Finally, I got up and asked the manager where our food was he said he would take care of it right away. A few minutes later the food comes out. Mind you my I got my food BEFORE my three year old and I ordered hers an hour earlier!! We had to wait another ten minutes for hers. Awful.

After dinner, I was blown away to see our bill still had my daughter&#39;s meal on it. I went and found the manager again to explain why we shouldn&#39;t have to pay for her meal. He took it off, but not her drink...lol. Figures. We just had so much hope for this restaurant so it was disappointing. 

Pros: very charming Mariachi Band! They sang a whole song for us. Also, the family sitting behind us bought us dessert to congratulate us on our recent marriage! Beyond blown away by their kindness! 

Sadly, we will never come back. Too many other great Mexican places to choose from close by."

So I have this theory on cultural music and restaurant performers are the last remaining public exposure to culture outside of ethnic summer festivals. These guys were great. Call ahead to see what days they are there.

When I worked nearby this was a great place for appetizers and beers (or margaritas). I will always remember Ricardo&#39;s birthday here.

Regarding kids, the food is good and plenty of it is not spicy. So much so that between food he could eat and the mariachi band (I mentioned them, right?) my six year old had a blast."

They play Mexican music on weekends - apparently mostly cumbias, some cha cha and merengues.  Music is WAY TO LOUD.  The DJ is a complete moron who seems ti equate volume with quality.  His transitions between songs were awkward.  Sometimes I didn&#39;t know what to dance to.  And my ears are still ringing.  

The other negative they had was very obtrusive security.  One guy with his security cap and full uniform stood for a half hour on a wall near the middle of the dance floor with his arms crossed.  What a buzz kill!  I felt like I was at a prison social.  Maybe he was protecting the DJ.

Food was good.

The pros that come to mind from our dinner are:

- lots of ok tasting food for the dollar;  the chicken fajita dish was huge 
- clean and comfortable interior
- fresh tortilla chips and salsa
- very convenient location and parking

The cons were:

- the queso fundido appetizer was swimming in sausage grease
- the flour tortillas were cold and hard

The last time I was here the chimichanga was deep fried and had a wonderful cheese sauce on it. I asked if they had a cheese sauce and what did they put on it? Another big glob of the queso that we said we didn&#39;t like as an appetizer.  Ugh! The manager came over and said well maybe you had an enchilada or burrito. Really?

For $20 I got $40 worth of food, great deal, right?  I don&#39;t think so.  I saved this groupon for about a 2 months, waiting to go for my birthday with my whole family.  It was an absolutely horrible experience.  The waiter pretended not to know what the groupon was, even though we were clearly at the correct restaurant.  He then continued the charade by stating that &#34;as a favor to me, I could use it.&#34;  Ha, even though I had already paid for it.  He was clearly angling for a larger tip, implying that groupon users are cheap and wouldn&#39;t tip in addition to the groupon.  Little did he know I was a waitress through college and usually tip 30% for excellence service.  Well, he certainly pissed that away.

In addition to insulting my intelligence with his ridiculous charade, he then tried to take advantage of my 60-something year-old father.  My father excitedly ordered a guacamole appetizer.  Well this jerk (sorry, but seriously), said &#34;what about the ceviche?&#34;  My father thought he meant a different way to prepare the gauc, said &#34;is that like Mexican-style with extra jalapenos?&#34;  The waiter so no, no, jalapenos, just Mexican style.  My father then agreed to the ceviche, not understanding this was a separate seafood appetizer for $12.  (my father HATES seafood, so he would have no idea what ceviche is).  But being a veteran waitress I knew, this guy had just upsold my father on something he would never eat.  The waiter ran from the table, so happy for the upsell, after about 5 minutes of searching for him, I actually had to flag down another server to cancel the ceviche.

But I am always am very careful about tipping and making sure the servers are taken care of which I know is the their reasoning because they lose out normally with people assuming the tip is included, etc. The food was great, the margaritas are to die for! Next time I will opt for their 16 oz. margarita because I got the jumbo 27oz. one and had a very hard getting through half of it!! Our server didn&#39;t crack a smile the whole time! And at the end he didn&#39;t know which Groupon was ours as he came up to us with 4 in hand. Ours was the color copy, the rest were black and white copies?? But then I check on my phone app for Groupon to make sure and it was disappeared!!? So they must have scanned the coupon!?  He got annoyed and walked away. Then I did find it in my used Groupons?? But he never said anything more so I&#39;m guessing it was fine! A bit of a hassle and I don&#39;t know if the language issue was a problem or he was just clueless!? But we got through it, besides the food/drink the server made our experience questionable!?"

I&#39;ve been to the Westmont location many times and the food is great there.  Naperville - not so much.  Went on a Saturday night and the place was pretty empty.  That should have told me something.  It never picked up while I was there either.  They got my order wrong but I had it anyway since we were in a rush.  Then they tried to still charge me for the meal I didn&#39;t get.  I was okay with paying for what they gave me but trying to charge me for something I never got come on (obviously I wanted something more expensive than what they gave me).

The food itself was a lot different than what I get in the Westmont location.  Maybe they had a new cook - i dunno.  What they gave me was very bland.  No flavor.  They are cheap on their sauces.  The protein was burned which made it chewy.  I was just generally disappoint with the whole experience."

My family and I have been going here since I was little, and now my sister and I finally have the pleasure of enjoying their margaritas! Yum. I recommend the standard house on the rocks, never fails.

I think Las Palmas has the best fajitas anywhere in the burbs. Hell, I&#39;d even venture to say best fajitas I&#39;ve ever had. They are always served piping hot with great, large cuts of meat and fresh veggies. I love the steak and chicken combo fajitas. I actually never order anything else here, they are that good.

My father gets the skirt steak with some really hot sauce on it, I think it&#39;s called Bistec... it&#39;s damn good and has a real kick to it. The standard chicken tacos and enchiladas are also note-worthy. 

We come a lot on Sundays for their buffet, which is vast and delicious. They serve lots of things like fajitas, pasta, carnitas, soup, salad...everything. Something funny: they have the best french fries! I swear they are divine. Sometimes they are on the buffet and I have to stop myself from eating a whole plate of french fries to save room for the authentic food. 

Last point: the staff is great. The owner is such a hard worker and really takes care of his customers. The wait staff are all great and have awesome personalities. The only time I notice a glitch in service is when they&#39;ve booked a musical gig on the weekend and all of the performers&#39; groupies haul it out to Las Palmas to see them. The place becomes really crowded then, so get there early or call ahead to see if they have entertainment that night!"

The margaritas are usually fairly priced along with the food. Big portions, and always cooked fresh and hot. 

Look on their website ahead of time for a coupon, as this will usually give you one free dinner with a purchase of another dinner.

Though to be fair, that was probably my fault for ordering the oh-so-delicious queso fundido.

Anyway, this was my second visit here and I was a lot happier with my experience this time - I guess I just ordered the wrong thing last time. The chiles rellenos, taquitos and Mexican rice were all excellent, as well as  the above-mentioned queso fundido - though anything made with chorizo is a winner in my book.  The lunch buffet offers a ton of variety and is a pretty good value for your money. The service here is also very friendly and quick.

I&#39;m very glad to have this place nearby - really good Mexican food is sadly hard to come by around here (with the exception of Front St. Cantina, but that&#39;s for another review.) Can&#39;t wait to go back and try the mango margaria."

Decided to go here after receiving a 20% off coupon for the entire bill. Someone in our party ordered a drink special for $5 and when the bill came the waitress told us we couldn&#39;t use our 20% discount coupon because we could not combine offers. She pointed out the fine print on the coupon. I told her it was a drink not a food special. She said it didn&#39;t matter. I asked her to charge the regular price for the drink which came out to $12 then give us the discount. All in all we saved $3 from a $60 tab. 
Food was bad. We ordered the taco plate. Crunchy tacos were soggy when they finally arrived at our table. Should have gone to taco bell. Would have had a better meal without the hassle. Guacamole was tasteless. Waitress seemed like we were putting her out.
I&#39;m not quite sure why they ever received a 4 or 5 rating. You want real Mexican Food, go to www.yerbabuenacuisine.com in Lisle, Illinois. It&#39;s down the street and Oh so worth it!"

We split a vegetarian burrito ( with spinach, mushrooms, onions, refried beans, Mexican rice, covered with ranchero tomato sauce and melted cheese, garnished with lettuce, tomato and sour cream)  and nachos supreme. 

Got the burrito without mushrooms, but decided to try the spinach, because I do generally enjoy spinach. However, spinach in a burrito? It was just too weird. I ended up pulling it out and just eating the rest of the burrito. 

But the portions were very large, definitely worth the price!!!  The nachos were nothing extraordinarily spectacular, but they were good and filling.

Heredity being what it is, she had an eagle eye out for any place that looked remotely Mexican.  Enter, Las Palmas.  

Now, I&#39;ll stop right here and tell you that we are insanely picky regarding Mexican food.  Really and truly.  We know this.  And we try to balance out our innate quest for warm and crispy tortilla chips and fresh-tasting salsa for the realization that not all Mexican restaurants are created equal.  But, Las Palmas was a disappointment.

I ordered my standard chile rellenos (standard vegetarian fare at a Mexican restaurant) and my daughter ordered chicken tacos.  Unfortunately, the chile rellenos was less than warm and very greasy and the chicken tacos, my daughter reported, were nothing special, &#34;The chicken was too chewy and the lettuce was singed&#34; (her descriptor of wilted, past-its-prime leafy veg).  The salsa was also bland and unremarkable and the chips merely meh.

Short review: Most mexican places charge less $ for much better food and better service. These people are obviously not even trying anymore! They survive off of lazy Napervillians who don&#39;t want to drive beyond a few miles &amp; don&#39;t know any better. 

We were one of two tables occupied and it took nearly 20 minutes to get our food. Strike One!
We ordered the guacamole appetizer which was $8. It consisted of a glob of guacamole on a plate with 3 chips shoved in it and bits of iceberg lettuce for garnish. rather flavorless and way overpriced for what it is. Strike Two!
All their meat is tough and fatty. Some of the meat has connective tissue attached. I tried the mexican buffet and it was gross. Not just gross, but cold as well. How the hell food in warming pans gets that cold is beyond me. Strike Three!
It gets worse...
My friend got a burrito and said the meat was not good. Also, he paid extra for sour cream and guacamole on the side. When he got the burrito there was nothing else on the plate. He told our server and she said. &#34;Oh no, we put inside the burrito.&#34; While there was plenty of sour cream inside, there was no guac. He only ate half of it. The other half we dissected and sure enough, no guac. The meat looked bad.
My mom ordered the the chicken fajita salad. It was supposed to come with sliced avocado and chicken fajita meat. It came with a blob of guacamole and gnarled chicken pieces that mom said were rubbery and sour. They looked really bad. The salad was finished up with iceberg lettuce, tomato slices (one was green) and dices jalapeno peppers. AND IT COST $10.95!!!
The manager took $3 off of our bill. I told him were never coming here again. he shrugged.

Being from Cali, I can be critical of &#34;good&#34; mexican restaurants. Pretty decent mex for the area (which doesn&#39;t have much mex outside of the fast food stuff).  They really need to update the interior though. 

Food is authentic enough. I could tell it&#39;s decent just from the chips and salsa.  Liking the cactus (nopales) in the side salad.  Steak tacos were pretty good, but a little dry. Cheese enchiladas were extra cheesy but I&#39;m not complaining, lol. Fried banana dessert is a nice ending. Good place to go for margaritas especially. Nice selection of tequila. Staff can make mistakes, but they&#39;re friendly.

I even think their chips and salsa is the best I&#39;ve had in a restaurant.  The only thing that always gets me is the price.

In fact, the place was El Torito many years ago. It may have been a chain but the food was solid, especially their buffet. So I thought OK, name change, new ownership, I&#39;ll give it a chance. As I ate the buffet, one song came to mind- &#34;Rapper&#39;s Delight&#34;...no joke. As I ate this food, this verse was running through my mind:
&#34;have you ever went over a friends house to eat and the food just aint no good 
i mean the macaroni&#39;s soggy the peas are mushed 
and the chicken tastes like wood 
so you try to play it off like you think you can by sayin that youre full 
and then your friend says momma he&#39;s just being polite 
he aint finished uh uh that&#39;s bull 
so your heart starts pumpin and you think of a lie 
and you say that you already ate 
and your friend says man there&#39;s plenty of food 
so you pile some more on your plate 
while the stinky foods steamin your mind starts to dreamin 
of the moment that it&#39;s time to leave 
and then you look at your plate and your chickens slowly rottin 
into something that looks like cheese.&#34;

That was my first visit from a few years back. I decided to give this place another chance. Not much flavor at all. Chick meat was so so as was the beef. Rice was so so, beans were pretty runny. The staff was VERY nice. Enchillada didn&#39;t taste very good at all (somewhat soggy).  Chips &amp; salsa might have been the best part of my meal. Not sure what the issue is because I&#39;ve know people who ate at different locations and the reviews are just the opposite. Maybe I&#39;ll try again down the road, but I have plenty of Mexican places I can go to now. 2.5 at best (for now anyway)."

I walked in and my waitress was Mexican....for a Mexican restaurant that is always a good sign. A sign that is NOT present at most of the chains around the area.

Chips and Salsa- good. Tacos- good (no greasy taco sauce here!). Chimichangas- delicious. Nice blend of meat, cheese, beans, and rice. Their rice and beans did not reek of &#34;can&#34; and were actually quite tasty. The boy reports that the enchiladas and tamales are a good bet as well. DEFINITELY the best choice I&#39;ve seen in the area.

HUGE PLUS: Margaritas!!  They are like smoothies with tequila! REAL FRUIT! Absolutely delish and quite reasonably priced.

This place will never compare to the authentic places I&#39;m used to in the city, where the owner/waitress/cook/cashier all live in the apartment above, make fresh tortillas, and dry their own peppers in the back...but for a suburban alternative, I recommend!"

The only exception to the greesy food is the chicken which was extreemly over cooked and felt like mush in my mouth.  It was so bad I barely ate it.  Last time we ordered Nachos and they were something I could whip up at home with some taco chips, ground beef that I do not drain the grese from and two types of cheese neither of which taste like a mexican melting cheese.  
And to top it off I have an IPhone application for the coupon clipper where you are able to show coupons without printing them.  They refused to accept the coupon because it was not in the print form.  Well if I knew it was going to be a problem I would have printed it before going.

Don&#39;t even know if they make deep dish pies, they&#39;d be smart not to! But their thin crust is passable.

At my job, holidays are double hourly pay and overtime is 1.5x so it&#39;s a tradition for someone to pony up some food for the 10-14 of us on a shift. In this case a manager wanted pizza for our group so I was the pick up guy. I was aghast when, with $60 cash in hand, her order for two large and one small pizzas totaled $70.95! I told the cashier lady that was expensive by Chicago, let alone Aurora, standards! She gave me a dismissive smirk.

Get them pies back to work and half of our shift&#39;s hungry masses are waiting. Perusing the receipt I see mgr ordered extry cheese on all 3 pies, accounting for $7 in overhead. The small pie was half cheese and half roni, I believe, but wholly unremarkable. The two larges were pinchy delicious though, I will say! Each had 3 toppings, some combo of sausage/onion/mushroom (how *I* like) and bacon/something/something. The extry cheese, I thought, was overkill.

Mgr and I concluded we still like Rosati&#39;s best though. I want a pizza where I first have to mop up red grease with a few napkins. Mmmmm! And too pricey here, come o&#39;!

PS: It&#39;s pronounced not &#34;ack&#34; but ach like how sandwiCH ends. One of the owners who had bad allergies and I guess sneezed a lot, like &#34;achoo!&#34; They have 3 slot machines inside so those inclined can get their gamble on!"

We called to place an order for pick-up last week, and the girl who answered the phone was extremely short with my husband. Not polite at all!
When we got there to pick up our pizza, we walked in to see a bunch of kids behind the counter, standing around. The girl gave us our pizza, and we left. 
Once we got home, excited for our delicious pizza, we realized it was seriously overdone. Barely any sauce left on it and the cheese was dark brown/almost black overdone.

However, looking for a new angle, I purchased a frozen  A-N-L pizza to cook in my own oven! &#34;That&#39;s a different perspective completely.

I decided to buck the odds in regards to label warnings regarding variable cooking time disclaimers, no warnings of &#34;gluten&#34;, and not a single &#34;peanut&#34; was involved!

Unfortunately the taste of A-N-L pizza doesn&#39;t translate the same in frozen form. The cooked pie had the taste of squeaking cheese curds on your teeth while the pizza sauce was as rare as ponding water on scorching asphalt.The Italian sausage only made an guest appearance.

It wasn&#39;t good!

The pizza is great, and while we&#39;ve tried a bunch of different options, the classic thin crust cheese and sausage is simply the way to go.

They&#39;ve got a really crazy &#34;super cheese&#34; pizza which I&#39;d say is worth trying once, as it&#39;s insane just how much cheese they manage to stack on it, but you&#39;ve got to *really* like your mozzarella to get through any more than once slice of it. Similarly, their taco pizza is great, but I recommend eating in if you&#39;re curious about one as they stack lettuce on top and you really need to eat it while it&#39;s in the sweet spot of the pizza being hot and the lettuce being cold.

Deducted a star as I *really* wish they offered delivery. Ach-n-Lou&#39;s would likely just be out default pizza place if they delivered, but I guess we just need to think ahead and keep a few of their frozen pizzas on hand for when we have pizza emergencies around my house."

There is nothing fancy about this place...just a little pizza pub in a strip mall off Farnsworth.  But the pizza is fantastic!  I order thin crust cheese and there is nothing else needed on this pizza - no need to smother it in cheese and peppers because it is perfect just as it is.  Beer &amp; wine is available in bottles.

I come here for lunch, as it&#39;s right down the road from work and the food is good.  The employees are extremely friendly and make you feel welcome.  

The interior is a nice mix of booth and table seating, but there&#39;s a bar and also gaming machines.  This place certainly deserves to have &#34;pub&#34; in its name.  It isn&#39;t overly bright in here unless you&#39;re near the windows. Closer towards the pickup counter and bar, the atmosphere is very pub-like. If you removed the restaurant portion, it would feel like a dive bar (that&#39;d be awesome!) I love me a good dive bar and maybe that&#39;s why I love this place so much. 

The pizza isn&#39;t bad but the sauce is a little sweet for my liking; it&#39;s very similar to Braconi&#39;s pizza sauce. The toppings and cheese are quality though, and the pizzas are well cooked so no complaints there. The thin crust is my favorite. If you choose, you may purchase their pre-made pizzas to bring home and cook at your convenience.  Every time I&#39;ve visited, I&#39;ve witnessed many patrons purchasing pizzas to bring home and cook later, so they must be good.  I&#39;m just a lazy cook when it comes to pizza and prefer delivery, but maybe I&#39;ll bring some home one day.

Their Italian beefs are phenomenal. Why? Because they are the size of a football and they sit in your belly like one.  You honestly will not need to eat for a while after consuming one of these bad boys.  What I love about them is they put the hot peppers UNDER the beef, therefore keeping them in place while you eat.  It&#39;s not your typical giardiniera either, but pickled peppers (small jalapeno or possibly serranos) sliced lengthwise.  It&#39;s different, but damn it&#39;s good. I also chose to have  it sweet topped; the bell peppers are raw and diced which was again different, but surprisingly good.  Portillo&#39;s has nothin&#39; on Ach-N-Lou&#39;s. 

Even though they have a bar, this place is family friendly and not somewhere to come, get drunk, and make a scene.  I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;d be somewhere to hit up for a date (nothing fancy here) unless your date is into low key and casual.  Good food, great vibe, friendly service. I&#39;m a fan!"

One of the better thin crust pizzas in the Chicoland area, IMO.   If you are going with the goal of being pampered with service and attentive wait staff - this is not your place.  You stand in line and place your own orders for food &amp; pick your own bottles &amp; cans of pop out of a cooler and then wait for you name to be barked out over the sound system.  The place is usually pretty busy, so you have to play the vulture game of table watching to bag an open table.

Good sauce.  Cheese is different from most pizza places and I mean different in a good way.  I can&#39;t put my finger on it? Is it a mix of mozz &amp; something else?  Different moisture content than regular pizza cheese? I don&#39;t know.  Great sausage - not the typical rabbit turd style by real sausage.  I am guessing it is made especially for them by a local butcher and not the typical pizza supply type.  I was a little saddened to see that they use a pre-made crust.  It is a good crust, but I had always thought that was their own.

Our favorite dish is the baked mushrooms.  Really simple, but really good.  Mushrooms, pizza sauce &amp; cheese.  My liking would be a little more baked cheese, like a French Onions Soup or baked lasagna - you know almost burned on top.  The cheese is the pizza cheese and is very thick and chewy.  

I have found Ach &amp; Lou&#39;s to be one of the few pizzas that is NOT as good or better as a next day leftover.  It must truly be enjoyed in the old school goodness of the Farnsworth Ave location.  It is just about unchanged since the &#39;70&#39;s.  I like that."

To me, it can be almost sweet, like a nice homemade Italian bread. Finally, I think they also spice the cheese a little with maybe some oregano or something. Whatever their recipe is, I REALLY like it. I purposely order Ach n&#39; Lou&#39;s whenever we have out of town guests because I like to introduce them to an Aurora institution.

It&#39;s not worth it to be treated horribly when you have given this business your time and money over the past 3 decades.

We have been eating here for years and never been disappointed.  Make sure you ask for fresh crust on a busy night.  It will take a few more minutes for your pie to arrive, but well worth the wait.   We love pizza, so we have tried every pizza place in the area, but always end up coming back to Ach&#39;s.   

Not a big fan of the recently added gaming machines, but I guess that is what we call progress in Illinois.  The gaming machines are crowding in on the bar which use to be a nice place to sit and have a beer while waiting for your pizza if you were getting it to go."

Other items on the menu include wings, spaghetti, an Italian beef sandwich, a meatball sandwich... you get the idea.  All of it is great stuff!

This is a &#34;family-style&#34; restaurant.  This is not a great place to go get drunk and loud with yer bros and/or brahs - there WILL be at least a few kids runnin&#39; around, especially if you go there on a weekend afternoon.  You&#39;re likely to see a local youth sports team there for a pizza party!  Behave yourself while you&#39;re there enjoying some killer food, and save the partying for another establishment later in the evening.

Please switch to a waitress type style of serving customers. Your system of having everyone come to the front counter to order and pick up their food and drinks is ridiculous. The physical space in which this takes place is way too small, and results in long wait times. If you&#39;re going to be stubborn and continue using this system, at least assign someone to the bar full time to handle drink orders only. Waiting in line almost 10 minutes to order a beer behind countless families ordering dinner for their entire table is frustrating.  

Now onto your pizza....The hand tossed pizza with sausage and green pepper was good, but the prebaked crust with super cheese and Italian beef was downright awful, and more like Italian beef casserole. The crust on the bottom was extremely soggy and could not support the toppings. This resulted in knife and forks being necessary.  

While I would be willing to eat your hand tossed pizza again, I don&#39;t have the patience required to put up with your inefficent ordering system. Let me know when you start hiring some waitresses. 

Sincerely, 

Thirsty, annoyed yet somewhat satisfied customer"

You walk up to the counter in the back of the restaurant, place your order, and go sit and wait for your name to be called. It saves you from having to tip a waitress from bringing out one item: pizza. 

Anyway, I&#39;ve heard numerous times on how great this pizza is. I have to say that I was underwhelmed. It&#39;s not bad, but there&#39;s nothing special about it, either. The sauce tastes like it came right out of a can - specifically one that says &#34;tomato paste&#34; on it. That&#39;s it. 

I doubt that I&#39;ll be back on my own. If a group of friends wants to meet up there, sure, but it hasn&#39;t happened to me yet, so it probably won&#39;t anytime soon."

I picked up the pizza no more than 5 to 10 min. after it came out of the oven and 15 min. later by the time i got home the cheese was pretty hard even with the sauce piping hot underneath it.

Really solid thin pizza! Fresh toppings as well! 

Hole in the wall place, have separate party room and a dining room. Would go again if I need a sit down pizza place. I am all about local businesses. This and Al&#39;s Pizza in Warrenville are my top two thin crust pizza places.

I LOVE pizza and I LOVE little &#34;hole in the wall&#34; pizza joints.  I will eat just about any type of pizza from just about anywhere!  From frozen to gourmet I LOVE pizza!  I am not picky about it!  I also love to surf YELP and find places that I haven&#39;t tried before.  I think everybody likes to try the &#34;best&#34; of something...
SO, I went to this pizza joint on the recommendation of friends.....and YELP.....  According to this site and the (current) 48 reviewers this pizza is considered one of the best in the area.
Big Mistake.  I don&#39;t know who these people are that are reviewing this place and giving it 3, 4, or 5 stars....
With all due respect to them I have to say that I disagree in every way possible.  The pizza was so bad that I couldn&#39;t eat more than 2 slices.  The sauce is thin, soupy and has a tomato ketchup sort of taste.  I can&#39;t describe it as anything but bland.  The pizza was undercooked and the crust was no better than your standard &#34;Jack&#39;s Frozen Pizza.&#34;  I guess the rest of the toppings were okay but for me if you have cruddy sauce you have a cruddy pizza.  That goes the same for the pizza crust. 
 
As far as prices go....the place is a rip off!  For a one large pizza with a couple of toppings I paid more than $25.00.  Just for a sub-standard thin crust pizza!  I didn&#39;t mind paying that price before I started eating the pizza.  At that time I didn&#39;t realize what I had just purchased.  I thought I was buying one of the area&#39;s best pizzas.  After I started to dig in and realized what I was eating I started to get a little bit upset.  I should mention that it was $25.00 without any drinks or appetizers.  
Ok....so after this experience I decided to give it another try.  A couple of friends were jabbering on about how &#34;wrong&#34; I was about Ach-N-Lou&#39;s.  They talked me into placing another order on a weeknight.  The argument was that &#34;maybe they were busy.&#34;    When all was said and done, it was the same bad sauce, lousy crust and this time the toppings were burnt.  At the end of the day.......They agreed with me."

The dining area is much larger than you might expect and groups can be accommodated with ease.

I haven&#39;t tried one but their &#34;Taco Pizza&#34; looks fantastic. Next time I will order it for sure.

Prepare for a bit of a wait and also to serve yourself for the most part, nothing wrong with that, just be aware. A tip is to call in your order in advance- it cuts down on the wait time if you want to have your pizza ready sooner."

Their sauce is unlike any pizza sauce I&#39;ve ever tasted.  It&#39;s a bit on the sweet side, but that&#39;s part of what makes it so fantastic.  The crust is also unlike any I&#39;ve ever had anywhere else. It&#39;s definitely thin, but not paper thin like a flatbread crust.  It also holds up well (not soggy or floppy), but it&#39;s not crispy.  It&#39;s perfectly chewy yet firm.  You won&#39;t be disappointed.

I typically order cheese, sausage and mushroom or cheese, pepperoni and mushroom.  Those ingredients are excellent.  They use fresh mushrooms (not canned mushrooms like some places use).  I&#39;ve not tried their other ingredients.  Also, the cheese they use is fresh and fantastic. 

Whenever I&#39;m out the Chicago Prime Outlets at the corner of I-88 and Farnsworth in Aurora, I call Ach &amp; Lous about 1/2 hour before I&#39;m done shopping to order my pizza.  Then when I get to the restaurant, it&#39;s usually 
read in a few minutes.

Total - $31.08 for the two pizzas (they forgot the beef and I paid $5.75 or so for that)"

Why go to some place fancy when you can pig out on awesome pizza and pichers of beer? Of course, the wedding was fancy - but the rehearsal does not have to be. If you want a real community experience, go to Ach-N-Lou&#39;s. 

The counter service is always fast and good - they know you by your first name if you&#39;re a regular. It&#39;s nice to be able to see the kitchen in full swing too - just makes it more original. 

The pizza is always piping hot - becareful, but that makes it sooooo good. 

The place is ALWAYS crowded! Never expect to be there by yourself - plan ahead and grab the tables before they&#39;re gone. 

Only mistake Ach-N-Lou&#39;s made was to replace the wooden picnic tables in the back with plastic picnic tables. 

Ach-N-Lou&#39;s perfecet for any event, get together, or just family experience."

I always remember driving past it when going to the outlet mall, but I never think to stop there.  It&#39;s located in a mini strip mall.  I didn&#39;t think the inside would be as big as it was.  The place was pretty crowded, and most of them were locals because I remember seeing them from my job.  

Anyways, a bunch of us were celebrating a friends birthday, and we got there just in time to nab 3 tables.  This pizza place is one of those where you go to the counter and place/pay for your order, and then they call your name to come get it.  A couple of people got the veggie pizza, and the others got a cheese and sausage pizza.  I&#39;m not a huge fan of thin crust, but I really liked this one.  They also offer an ultra thin crust, which I&#39;m assuming is more like the crackery version kind of crust.  The pizza was DELISH! One of my friends told me that they use 100% real mozzarella cheese and such...boy was she right! The sausage and cheese pizza was so ooey gooey! And their actual sausage was good too.  You know how sometimes sausage at pizza places can taste like poo in your mouth, or have too many fennel (sp?) seeds.  

So I guess to sum it up, it&#39;s a great place to have a good ol&#39; pizza and beer....or pop...or h2o."

I must say that the buffalo wings are some of the best I&#39;ve had! Tender and Juice with just the right kick, I could enjoy the wings with no ranch or blue cheese dipping sauce, which is a very good thing!

I fell for them.  All of them.  I wanted to like it, I really did.  I was sick and tired of every suburban pizza place disappointing me by being a Rosatti&#39;s or tasting like it. I hoped this would be my pizza place.  This place fell dreadfully short of any reasonable expectation.  First of all my pizza not only didn&#39;t wow me, but it became more of a commitment or a matter of principle to eat it.  It was after all, my dinner for that evening.  The crust was like cardboard and the items on the pizza were wet and didn&#39;t taste fresh.  It was like they took the pizza out of a freezer and baked it for me.  If I wanted that, I would have paid $2 for a Tombstone.  That reminds me, the pizza was pricy.  I&#39;m not against pricy pizza, so long as it tastes good.  I prefer Pizza Now! or Papa John&#39;s, or even Domino&#39;s, so much as it pains me to say so.  As bad as the pizza was, it was nothing compared to the wings. In the spirit of full disclosure, I consider myself as sort of a buffalo wing aficionado.  Growing up about an hour outside of Buffalo, NY, I know what a buffalo wing should taste like.  I know how they should be cooked.  I might be a bit of a wing snob, yes, but I gave the wings here a chance.  I asked a battle-worn lady behind the counter who talked to people like she owned or at least ran the place if their wings were any good.  She assured me, yes.  I should have asked if they were fried, but who asks if buffalo wings are fried?  That&#39;s the only way they are made.  The only debate about a buffalo wing is whether or not they are breaded, I got my pizza and wings to go or else I would have sent the wings back.  When I got home I realized that they were not only baked, but I&#39;m not sure if they were even cooked all the way.  The skin was still loose and fatty, the chicken hot and slimy.  There wasn&#39;t even enough sauce on them to coat.  I choked down one and thought I had better try and eat another one to try and get my money&#39;s worth.  Big mistake.  Ach-N-Lou&#39;s is a complete waste of time, that is, unless you enjoy hot, wet, circles of garbage and soggy baked wings with skimpy sauce."

It&#39;s located in a strip mall which shouldn&#39;t be a deterrent if you&#39;re thinking about stopping by. The ordering system may be a little strange if you&#39;ve never been here before. There is no wait staff. Basically, you go up to the register and put your order in, drinks are either in the cooler or you can get pitchers of beer or soda, then they call your order over the loud speaker for you to pick up at the counter. Like I said, it gets busy on the weekends and there is no wait staff so sometimes it can be hard finding a table but we&#39;ve never had a problem yet. The other food and sandwiches they offer is ok, but I come here for the pizza. They have a nice sauce which is a little on the sweet side, which I think is delicious.

I really like the shrimp tacos, especially when accented by some of the roasted jalapeno salsa from the salsa bar! Corn tortillas aren&#39;t terribly leathery either (I&#39;m a flour girl).

The menu is apparently generic with the rest of the locations but they don&#39;t have some things here (like horchata), so that must be a drag to have to correct. (I got mandarin Jarritos instead.)

I really like their chips (they err on the greasy side) and as stated the roasted jalapeno salsa! Caliente!!

As previously mentioned, the place is small and it can get LOUD. So check your mood then determine whether you want to dine in or take out. The parodies of old Mexican movie posters make for fun decor. 

My parents live nearby so we will probably eat here more often. Reasonable prices and a lot of choices."

The men/boys behind the counter were nice, and patient while I looked over the menu as this was my first visit here. I ordered two steak tacos and one garlic chile shrimp taco to go. Ate it fifteen minutes later once I arrived home.

The tacos are made with soft corn tortillas. I found the meat and shrimp, as well as the tacos in general, to be very bland. They do offer about 8 hot sauces and salsas, of which I did use one, but still the tacos were lacking in taste. Additionally, the tacos are American style with lettuce, tomato, and cheese, which is a negative in my book. I prefer the more authentic cilantro-onion topping.

They do fill the tortillas full, so two tacos would have been sufficient.... three was overkill. If I was to return to Taco Fresco again, I think choosing a full meal platter (with rice and beans) and dining in would result in a better experience.

Overall, the tacos (in my opinion) taste quite similar to El Famous Burrito restaurant. 

What this restaurant does have in it&#39;s favor, is a colorful dining room, with a Panera-Bread-like atmosphere... everyone relaxing and enjoying a meal with friends and family. It was also nice to see the staff cleaning the dining room tables quickly once a customer was done at the table."

After seeing Gravity at Showplace I did a search here on Yelp for a taco spot. Had no idea this spot was here for four years. Had to do the cruise around to find it as the marker was off. 

I have never heard of Taco Fresco (other Naperville location is closed) and found this franchise location serves up some tasty tacos. They have four locations in the city and another in St. Charles. I had one pork and one lean beef on corn tortillas. I over looked the salsa bar at first but quickly relies they&#39;re dry without salsa. At least six salsa varieties and I enjoyed a couple of them. A bit pricey but there was a good amount of meat on them both.

I was given a frequent spender card and just might need to try a dinner here in the future. Always nice to be able to enjoy a lunch outside, seating available right out their front door."

I usually get the steak quesadilla and by boo gets the carne asada torta. It&#39;s definitely a unconventional torta - a huge piece of meat versus the chopped up variety I&#39;m used to. It&#39;s good, though - like a Mexican inspired steak sangwich.

that being said I have typically enjoyed my meals from a &#34;fresh and healthy&#34; standpoint, but I am always left with something to desire, ie: flavor.  Their foods are a little bland which is disappointing.  Eating healthier doesn&#39;t mean loosing flavor. 

The flavor profile should obviously be different than typical Mexican food, cooked with lard and oils, but you can still muster a TON of flavor in a dish using the right amount of citrus, cilantro, onion, garlic, oregano, jalapeno, etc.  

At the end of the day if you are someone like me who enjoys the experience of a meal more than just feeling full this may not be your ideal stop."

If you get the side of rice be sure to go with the beef or shrimp rather than plain. You&#39;re selling yourself short otherwise. Like people that want a tablet and buy something other than the iPad - you&#39;re just putting yourself in a losing situation!

They also have ahi tuna and tilapia for those for are looking for some seafood.

What i really like about this place in comparison to other Mexican joints in the area, is that you do not feel like the food you are eating ends with you feeling like you are experiencing sodium overload.

Steak - Good, not enough steak.
Ahi Tuna - Very Good, Ahi a bit over done.
Chicken - Very Good.
Tilapia - EXCELLENT.  &#34;Little Village Style&#34; - this was the best.

Honestly, the prices are a little too high IMO.  Tacos are $2.50-2.95 each.  Four tacos didn&#39;t quite fill me up, and with a drink was almost $13 bucks.  A little steep for lunch......fill em up with meat and fixins, and it will be worth the price.

HOW DO TACOS GET COLD IN A MATTER OF MINUTES?? They are wrapped in foil, why when I got food there on my break by the time I walked back to my store my food was always cold??

I&#39;m not sure how you can mess up a torta, but they did.
I&#39;m not sure why my torta carne asada had a singular large piece of steak placed sloppily between two pieces of bread, it was burned and after a bite not edible, and then topped with guacamole which might have been the only decent thing about it all. I took two more bites, but couldn&#39;t really bite since the steak comes in ONE SINGULAR PIECE. I have never eaten a torta like this and it was a waste of money.

Chicken tacos for the little one, equal waste of money.
Worst part is, there is no excuse for the food to have been so foul tasting because I was the ONLY customer in the store. Whatever, 17$ later I learned my lesson not to return to this &#34;mexican&#34; eatery. 

Instead I was pleased to know a Chipotle will be opening right across the street where even if it isn&#39;t &#34;real&#34; Mexican food at least it tastes GREAT.

Menu is similiar to other Taco Frescos - best points being the fresh salsas and large menu selection, including many &#34;healthy&#34; and vege options for the entree items.  I opted for the grilled tuna fish tacos, which ended up slightly dry, but not terrible - the salsa definintely saved them.

Chips are great tasting, but the knowledge of the definite deep fry draws back a little bit.  The chicken tortilla soup is a little different than most other chicken tortillas you may usually have - there wasn&#39;t any (or very little) cumin in the mix, and the soup was more clear.  It was very good though, and decently priced vs. the soups at Panera a few doors down.

Service was a bit slow during the first week, though I think the kinks would be worked out in due time.

Taco Fresco is considered fresh-mex, like a mash-up between Mexican food and a salad bar.   The good thing is I actually went in there craving a salad and ordered the Chicken Taco-salad, it was a good deal at 5.79.  The portion was pretty large in comparison to some other places in the area.  I do agree with one of the prior posts regarding the salsa being bland but its a good thing for me that I also picked up some of their ranch dressing which was quite tasty.  If you want a cost effective, quick meal, give this place a shot."

I ate at the one near Naper and 88 a while back and it was terrible.  So I find myself looking for a place to eat easy and cheap before a movie near Rt. 59 and 95th St. and the pickins in the area are slim.  So here is where I landed.  The two taco platter for $8 was so not worth it.  The meat (about 2 bites worth) was buried under a pile of veggies on top of soggy tortillas and tasted like it&#39;s been sitting a while.  The rice tasted like it was microwaved from a frozen TV dinner.  The chips took a double dip in the fryer rendering them greasy and shiny.  How can you screw up tortilla chips, people?  I eat a ton of Mexican food and I&#39;m sure the Mexican folks working here are saying to themselves &#39;I wouldn&#39;t eat this crap&#39; en Espanol.  This place is for moneyed suburbanites who don&#39;t know good Mexican food if it fell into their lap.  I don&#39;t understand all the high ratings of this place.

There are two lanes and two drive thru order kiosks and a set of winding paths that lead to the window where you pay and pick up your food. 

I decided to try the two hot dog special, my food was ready quickly and I was soon on my way home. The hot dog included was a skinless dog, it came on a soft poppy seed bun. The pickle included is thin and not sour, a small tomato slice was included towards the center of the dog and celery salt was visible. Just the right amount of mustard, onions and relish were applied and the sport peppers weren&#39;t too hot. 

The fries included were thin fries very similar to those served by Mickey&#39;s Hot Dogs in Villa Park. They weren&#39;t too salty and had a nice potato filling. These complimented the hot dog very well.

Overall Jimmy&#39;s makes an excellent Chicago Style Hot dog, none of the frequent missteps made by other hot dog joints were present here. I&#39;d recommend Jimmy&#39;s Dog House, good food at a fair price."

The Egg Drop soup was flavorless. I think there was ZERO salt in it. Fried rice was OK. Egg Foo Young OK, but NO CHINESE VEGE&#39;S. The Egg Foo sauce was darker than I&#39;ve ever seen. Mongolian chicken consisted of chicken, large slices of yellow onion, and sauce. I never had Mongolian chicken before, maybe it doesn&#39;t have many vege&#39;s.

What we got, while not the worst, was nothing to write home about either. Because they are the only show in town (that I know of so far), we have ordered from them twice. I have to say that the delivery times were nice and quick, both times we were quoted a 45 minute delivery time, and the food arrived in about half an hour. No problems there unless you had planned around the 45 minute wait time.

Now, onto the food. We have ordered the General Tso&#39;s chicken, chicken fried rice, egg rolls, crab rangoon, pot stickers, and a few others. The General Tso&#39;s chicken tastes good, but the quality of the meat is horrendous. In one order, there were three pieces that had bone fragments embedded in them, and not tiny ones either. The crab rangoon would be good if they didn&#39;t fill it to capacity with onions, the egg rolls are nothing to write home about, and the potstickers are waaaaaaaay too doughy (the pork mixture inside is tasty though).

It tastes like a slightly oily normal rice with a hint of salt.  The vegetables were soggy and bland.  Ok... a swing and a miss.

The General&#39;s Chicken?  totally bland.  It was literally tasted like sugar syrup, sweet pepper and mediocre fried chicken.  I was not impressed.  The chicken itself was stringy and had too much gristle for just small pieces of chicken.  

My ex&#39;s veggies?  Bland and fatty tasting.  No kidding.

Then I had one or two questions about specific items and was told by the person helping me that they could not elaborate on anything because they have never had it before... 
My order was confirmed at least three additional times(which fine I guess) and then I was told if I was using credit I would be paying 10% extra. The credit card attachment device would not work and I was told I had a problem with my card.. Upon the sixth try low and behold it went thru
All the chicken items I got were very good but I got a beef seek kabob and it was not good at all.
For the prices I think the food is reasonable, the service however is comical at best. Everything takes very long and don&#39;t rely on the staff to be able to do much, even take your order this took a very long for me on this visit. All the chicken items were excellent. Go for the food and the opposite of good service"

The naan was pretty good. The rice dish I had some problems with. i don&#39;t mind larger chicken bones with my dish, but there was a number of very small vertebrae bones mixed in. That really hurt the experience because I had find that out the hard way (lucky I didn&#39;t chip a tooth). I spent the rest of meal being super careful with each bite and eventually I through away a large amount of the meal.

I can&#39;t recommend this restaurant based on my experience."

They have a good selection and the food tastes good/fresh. Their puri and chana are decent and perhaps one of the better ones in the area from what I have tried. Their service is pretty standard. Nothing to brag about but I would recommend this place.
saag-hut-aurora,Hira H.,JQ0WIULuDW_EoADiSv2bMw,"Aurora, IL",0,1,0,98,8,YeKWb-1Jhn4sV9i_6aOQ7Q,5.0,2014-08-17,"I&#39;m not someone who tends to go online and write a lot of reviews - but the food here is SO good, I couldn&#39;t help but want to scream it to everyone at the top of my lungs! Let&#39;s make something clear, I&#39;m a foodie of the CRAZY kind, but I am also an accomplished cook, so I&#39;m VERY discerning about my food (especially desi food). This place has the BEST Pakistani food, this side of town, and stays true to it&#39;s root. The food at Saag Hut truly reminds me of Pakistani food IN Pakistan - it&#39;s authentic and flavorful. 

Let&#39;s talk about the menu (I&#39;ve tried EVERYTHING on the menu, this review has been 3 months in the making!) - starting with what the restaurant is named after:

Special Saag - This is a delectable combination Spinach and Mustard leaves, with just the perfect amount of heat. To be eaten with their Makkai Roti, or their Paratha. The way it&#39;s served, along with it&#39;s taste, is COMPLETELY reminiscent of food of the Punjab. Truly one of the BEST things on their menu! 

Chicken Tikka Boti - Large succulent pieces of boneless chicken marinated in the perfect blend of spices, and baked in the tandoor (clay oven) - these have the kind of flavor that would blow your mind! This is one of my favorite things on the menu, and I tend to eat these just by themselves. A complete explosion of flavors, with the perfect char on the outside, and juiciness on the inside - these are a MUST try! 

Chapli Kabab - Another hidden gem on the menu. A lot of people don&#39;t know about chappli kababs, and therefore, they tend to not order them. Imagine a nice large patty of succulent ground beef, with chopped onions, chilli, coriander mixed in, and marinated with the right blend of spices, then fried to a nice, beautiful crispy brownness. Mouth-watering!!! Try them, on their own with a paratha, that&#39;s the way I go.

Chicken Handi - This dish is a DIFFICULT one to perfect, but Saag Hut has done it. It&#39;s a rich, sumptuous chicken curry that utilizes lots of onions, and is usually made and served in a clay handi (pot). This savory curry has a base that is like silk, without being creamy or too heavy, and despite the zillions of spices that go in there, it still leaves chicken as the star of the dish. Another favorite of mine - this one is best with just plain naan. 

Fish Curry - My MOST favorite thing on their menu, next to their Saag. Their fish curry is like a fish karahi/kadhai. Tomatoes, chilies, ginger, garlic and onions are the supporting cast of this dish, while the fish itself is the king. Nice fillets of fish sit in a wonderfully zesty curry that pairs well with both naan and white rice. I tend to call half an hour in advance for this dish, as they always make it fresh - and it is ABSOLUTELY well worth the wait, I PROMISE YOU! 

Chicken Corn Soup - I know, you&#39;re thinking, &#34;really!?!?&#34; the chicken corn soup? YES, yes, YES, my friend! Their chicken corn soup is flavored, and spiced just right to remind you of the chicken corn soup sold by the thelay-waalas (street vendors) selling this soup. It&#39;s not to say it&#39;s unsafe or anything, it just has the PERFECT flavor. In the winters, I order this twice a week, every week...it&#39;s absolutely BRILLIANT! Again, call in advance, for this unknown gem on the menu! 

Daal Fry - Another brilliant vegetarian dish. So many restaurants master their meat dishes, and leave their veggie dishes wanting. Not this restaurant, this lentil curry is a revelation, and simply delicious. Good with either rice or naan (or if you are my dad, both!). 

Bread Pakora - If you have NO idea what this dish is, you are in for a delectable treat. Envision this, rectangular pieces of bread, with a scrumptious potato filling sitting atop of it, dipped in a spiced whisked egg wash, and then deep fried to golden perfection. These are to be eaten RIGHT AWAY, these are NOT the take-home kind of food as they will get soggy - but these fried pieces of heaven are SO worth a try! 

Lastly, all their parathas and their naan are absolutely to die for. I didn&#39;t even LIKE Mooli Parathas (Daikon Radish filled Paratha), until I tried theirs. I don&#39;t usually order it, but I might when the mood strikes. Let me tell you, either call and order in advance, and let them know you are coming to eat, so they are prepared for your order, or be prepared to wait for your food. It&#39;s SIMPLE, the food is ABSOLUTELY FRESH, and you can TASTE this - but the caveat is the wait. I find a wait perfectly acceptable for food that tastes this FANTASTIC! The staff will keep you company, they are the NICEST staff I&#39;ve come across at ANY desi restaurant! Also, the interior is sparse, but again, they&#39;ve stayed true to their origins, as foodies (especially desi foodies) will tell you, &#34;It&#39;s not about how it looks, but how it tastes!&#34;

If I could, I&#39;d give it 10 stars, but Yelp won&#39;t allow it (what gives, Yelp!)...it&#39;s &#34;home away from home&#34; for me...."

Remember that this is a family owned restaurant and they have very limited food items off the menu.  They usually have 5-6 items made....and they will let you know when you ask. I have tried the chicken handi, Karahi chicken, chicken biryani, and a few tandoor items..all chicken. It all tastes really good, you won&#39;t be disappointed They rarely make anythjng with lamb/goat..I see it sometimes during buffet. I guess they&#39;re trying to save money. 

What..I don&#39;t like is during their buffets is that they purposely delay making rotis and people get tired of waiting and move on to rice. They have done this A LOT OF times. It&#39;s really cheap and defeats the whole purpose of buffet. I like the owner..who&#39;s usually in the front and he&#39;s very sweet. Their service is really slow at times but that&#39;s to be expected knowing that it&#39;s family owned..and they&#39;re to save as much money as possible. Doing take out is probably the best thing to do :)"

Service used to be good until they hired this one female server. She is pretty rude and isn&#39;t really attentive. We came in for lunch one day and she asked if we were with a party. It was 2 of us so I said no. She then said that we had to leave,  even though there were 3 tables empty. This wasn&#39;t the first time we had a bad encounter with her. We will not be coming here again eve though we live 3 minutes away. 

*original review*
We came in right before closing (without realizing it) and they were still very accommodating. They even left the kitchen open until we said we were done. 

Food was very tasty.  We got the chicken tikka boti and karahi gosht. Both excellent but could have done with a little more portions.

The decor was great but the temperature was a little cool because of people opening the entrance door. Still, I will definitely eat here again. It&#39;s one of the best tasting Pakistani restaurants in Chicagoland."

There was a mutton karahi dish that had 3 small pieces of mutton floating around in a pretty liquidy brown-colored gravy. Cooked in too much oil/butter and did not taste good at all. 

Chicken haleem was not bad, probably the best of what I tasted that evening. There was also Chicken tikka masala, which was passable, not too bad or good. However everything was very very oily. I wish they used less oil/butter for cooking."

Saag hut has made sure that they stay true to their name. Hands down the BEST saag outside of Punjab (either side of the border)! The non-veg dishes we tried, boti kabab, shami kabab and aloo-gosht were made very well and we could taste the authenticity of it all with every bite.

What makes it even better is that the owner / staff are some of the most humble and nice people I&#39;ve come across. 

If you&#39;re in the mood for awesome Pakistani food, give this place a chance..it will charm you with it&#39;s simplicity and awe you with it&#39;s quality and taste.

Took my to friends that were super unsure of this choice of restaurant but were super The price when I got the food their eyes got big and my one friend didn&#39;t even want To eat.

They served us old biryani, mutton karahi was full of half-cooked onions &amp; tomatoes and the naan was raw from one side and burnt from another. The worst part was, mosquitos. There were lots of mosquitos and fruit flies. They bit us and probably fell into our food too. I am sad to know that they have compromised their food quality and cleanliness."

I have never had it before so I have nothing to compare it to.  It&#39;s very similar to Palak Paneer, which is one of my favorite things to eat.

They also served the best naan I have ever had, and it isn&#39;t even close.  So fluffy and flavorful, soaked up the juices of the Saag and tucked each flavor into the proper taste bud.

I will be back often.  I am really thrilled to have Pakistani food so close to home.

Fruity with strange aftertaste. The food was sub par looking and it was all &#34;chicken&#34; on the bone. We exchanged it for &#34;whatever he thought we&#39;d like&#34; which ended up being tough,&#34;boneless&#34; mystery meat he called chicken, and a huge plate of white rice. The naan was doughy and tasteless and we consistantly heard a mircowave which made us worry more! We asked for music and he said he just turned it offf and would turn it back on, but that never happened. We soon after payed and left. never to return again. Lesson learned. Do not recommend at all....."

It was a slow night so they closed a little early. The person that calls the shots while I got there hooked it up with a free slice of pizza for my troubles. 

The reason I went though was cause I was craving some spaghetti and meatballs. The pizza I had was so good that I went back today and got a sampler pizza and spaghetti and meatballs. Both were fucking delicious. I&#39;ll be back as often as I can for the two slice lunch special and every time I get the craving for spaghetti and meatballs. This place is amazing. I&#39;ll also be getting pizza here anytime I&#39;m craving that NY style. 

There was another review where some guy commented about his food spilling in the car. I posted some pictures about my food and also how my spaghetti was wrapped. Either this place added some extra security to their to go orders so you don&#39;t gotta worry about your food spilling out, or that reviewer is a fucking idiot. 

I&#39;m leaning towards the latter cause he said the restaurant didn&#39;t try to make it right but then the owner commented saying she offered another order then and that the offer for a free order still stands."

This place is a NYC style pizzeria/Italian Eatery. They offer pizza slices for carry out customers, as well as a decent size dining room with table service

We sat down and ordered a large pepperoni pizza, cheese fries and a small pasta for my kid. Food was good, but a little pricey and they don&#39;t have the capabilities to offer fountain drinks, so we were served 20 oz bottles out of their front cooler which means.....no refills

If I do come back, it&#39;ll be to try something different off their menu. Their pizza isn&#39;t bad, but I prefer Chicago style thin"

I was a little bummed to find out after I had paid and looked at the receipt that there was a fee of $1.25 added for ordering through their website (for the first time) that wasn&#39;t mentioned anywhere in the order process. I was just getting carry out. Had I known, I would have just ordered over the phone or even had it delivered if it wasn&#39;t much more.

There is little question about that from my view. There pizza is NY style in the truest form: big slices, thin, foldable, and good greasy. But their menu is full of doughy goodness so let&#39;s breakdown our first visit.

Ambiance
Walk in and you are in the takeout area or by a slice spot. I would love to see them flipping pie dough and getting that NY feel but not so much.

The dining area has my love on the ceiling - outdoor lighting! Wallpaper brick brings a little taste of an Italian  restaurant.

Menu
It is pretty robust with many choices. I&#39;m not a huge fan of trying to be everything to everyone so tried to block out a lot of it. I want what they do the best.

Service
A little disappointed. There wasn&#39;t much excitement when we entered. In fact, there was stress and confusion. This was an early Sunday evening. It took about 15 minutes to get a table for six because they had to clean one off. Plenty of room but it was slow going. Our person was also less than excited and we tried hard to engage her. Owner was walking around and chatting it up, which is nice to see. We never had her visit with us.

Line formed as we ate.

OUR ORDER

Pizza
We asked what the recommendation was for a first timer and it was the standard cheese. Love that message - it should stand on its own. We followed the recommendation but did add pepperoni to one side. The pizza is really good. It is NY so the sauce is light and it is mostly cheese and dough. That means those two things have to be on point and they are very good. Without question, best NY I&#39;ve had in Chi area and definitely the burbs. Table was split between ok and great. The ok was the grease and pepperoni as well as service. The great was that even though a lacking flavor, the dough was exceptional!

Pepperoni was uneventful and made it too greasy. Would try sausage for some flavor. 

Appetizers
We&#39;ve been on a mad search for garlic knots that match ones we had in college. We&#39;ve found them! These have the garlic kick of Bob Chinn&#39;s with a tremendous doughy taste. Home run!

Mozzarella sticks were recommended and they were a great choice. These are homemade and it shows. Different sizes and lots of cheese with an amazing breaking. Makes me think breaded raviolis would be worth a try.

Dessert 
We did he Zeppoles on recommendation from a frequent visitor. These were again a product of excellent dough. Homerun!

Will we be back? Yep. 
Rating: we gave it a four because of the apps and dessert. Pizza was a 3.5 and service was a 2-2.5. Like to spin the pizza again because I think without the pepperoni we are taking an easy 4.

Tips
1. 18&#34; is perfect for four people
2. If kids are less of sauce fans, they&#39;ll love
3. Skip pepperoni"

The first time the pizza arrived messed up as the driver said he had to slam on his breaks and the pizza went flying. They replaced the pizza with a larger size which was nice but it was under cooked. First try not impressed!

After hearing friends rave about their pizza I thought I would try again. Ordered pizza at 6:11 PM with an estimated delivery time of 55-60 minutes, pizza arrived at 8:00. Granted it was a Friday night but at least let me know before I order its going to be close to 2 hours.

The pizza itself is average and at $30 for a medium 3 item pizza after all the additional charges (on-line ordering charge, delivery charge, tip, etc.) I will be ordering elsewhere going forward."

Back to the days of when there was so much garlic in the air that your eyes would water, and you would want to jump out a window, rather then being crammed  in a one bedroom apartment with about 20+ members of your family that you would have to scream just to talk to the person next to you.  But we long for those days because the food was so good and the company wasn&#39;t bad either.  

While I do not have a time machine, or the ability for weekend flights back to NY to get some real pizza, this place is about as close as we will get.  Back to that apartment in Manhattan, with food almost pouring out of the oven, and all of us arguing over who would get to use the only bathroom.

The food is so delicious, that my wife and I refuse to share a cannoli and must have our own, they&#39;re straight out of those little corner bakery&#39;s.  They have perfect crunchiness and the filling is something out of a dream so you know they&#39;re are fresh.  If they have a Cappuccino that brings me back to a sidewalk cafe in Brooklyn as the sirens go howling by, and I&#39;m sitting across from my Aunt Loretta; I&#39;m moving in next door!

Truthfully, it&#39;s not the greatest pizza I&#39;ve ever had, that&#39;s a personal matter, BUT ITS PRETTY DAMN CLOSE!  I will continue to return hungry for more!

Updated, 2 weeks later.  My family and I have been back to visit a few times since we first discovered this gem.  I&#39;m really considering requesting a table with our name on it since we&#39;re easily recognized by almost the entire staff.  The mozzarella sticks are perfect for a picky 20 month old, or my wife, except don&#39;t ever come between the girls and these little bites of heaven, you&#39;ll loose a finger!  

We&#39;ve even introduced a few of our pickier Chicago natives, family and friends, to our new spot, and everyone loves both the atmosphere and the food.  

I&#39;ve also gone out of my way to spread word of mouth to anyone that I know who will appreciate this heavenly creation, and will actually listen.  I would chisel it in on the  Pyramids of Giza, if it wasn&#39;t so damn hot and I don&#39;t want to be arrested for damaging a historical landmark.

My tip for anyone who doesn&#39;t have the overall enjoyable experience&#39;s as we have; is to be respectful and talk with the staff, TALK, Not belittle or complain on social media first, and you will find they will work to earn your business. 

P.S.  I did finally get my cappuccino, but was over ruled by my better half out of moving in next door. &#34;Sad face&#34;"

Delicious, foldable slices and a very friendly staff made for a very good dining experience although the Caesar salad could have had a creamier dressing. Also, the addition of a soda fountain would be nice as $2.00 for a 20 ounce bottle of pop is a bit much. Still, the pizza is more than good enough for many a return visit."

Pizza is solid-I prefer NY style thin to &#34;Chicago&#34; style-and sauces for pizza and pasta are good.   Meatballs are o.k. but the last two times I&#39;ve had them, they were almost burnt.   Portions are large, so you get a decent value here, plus they run daily specials.

At least that&#39;s what I thought. This is a small place, thank goodness they&#39;re expanding since there just isn&#39;t much seating. 

Currently, there are no fountain drinks. The refrigerator that had the soda cans and bottles was at sixty degrees. That&#39;s simply not cold enough. we asked for some cups with ice and they said that didn&#39;t have ice. So they need ice, the chance to get a glass of water instead of a bottle. But then we found out they had just got the refrigerator that day so they were still figuring it out. So that&#39;s certainly forgivable.

Ok, onto the food. Garlic knots. The reviews for these have been amazing. I can&#39;t go that far. Good garlic knots have a crunch on then and these were just chewy. Good dough, plenty of garlic, but that crunch was sorely lacking. The marinara sauce was nice and zesty though. We got a large pizza, sausage and mushrooms on one half and meatballs and roasted peppers on the other. The sausage was round and sliced which is how I remember it coming on the East Coast. Just an amazing pizza, the ingredients were well proportioned, and just a magnificent flavor. We also had the Arthur avenue sandwich special. Roast beef, fresh mozzarella, fried eggplant and roasted peppers on toasted bread. It was a great combo. 

I also got a free order of Zeppole and little did I expect to get a grocery sized paper bag with about thirty little donuts with a ton and I do mean a ton of powdered sugar. Treated like bits of deep fried heaven. The service was really friendly as we were checked on and I think we got a few extra Zeppole.

There were a few kinks which hopefully will be solved with expansion. But the quality of the pizza alone makes this a place with returning to. Wow."

After a long day of swimming, water slides and sunshine, I pulled up reviews for &#34;best pizza&#34; in Naperville. Little Pops caught my attention with the rave reviews which are well earned. We were starving and took the plunge. We ended up having...
Fried, lightly battered string beans - yum
Boneless hot wings - soft on the inside, crispy on the outside with (fair heat quotient) buffalo wing sauce
Garlic knots - heaven sent knots of dough, garlic, parsley and butter 
Spaghetti, one with the homemade meatball - devoured.
Pizza (NY style), rich sauce, fresh toppings, crisp and chewy crust as our main course and a huge Stromboli -with pepperoni, ? prosciutto ? salami, mozzarella and sauce in a crispy rolled dough - yum and yum.
To finish we had the Zepoli - a generous portion of fried dough dusted in powdered sugar and served hot in a bag - excellent, soft chewy pillows to enjoy.

Sausage had great flavor. Sauce and cheese were on point as well. Not many New York style pizza places around so it is a breathe of fresh air and something different for us Chicagoians. Still love Chicago pizza but liked this a lot too. Service was good not great. Maybe server was just too busy since there was only one sever. Everyone else was really nice that we talked too.

The food was good, but the service sucked. We waited a good 30 minutes before the server acknowledged us, she got our order wrong, and I had to chase down another server to point out the mistake. We were told that the new pizza would be out in 10 minutes, but waited another 30 minuets for it.  People who had come in after us had eaten, paid and left before we even got our food.  How the hell does that even happen?  We were never approached by a manager, she stopped as asked everyone else how things were, but not ours. I guess she knew that we were not pleased at all. My husband and kids felt horrible since it was my birthday and we had such a bad experience."

Nice that the cashier checked and brought it right out to me as I was peaking at the new dine in area. 

Another very tasty meal.   Wasn&#39;t really sure about meat balls on pizza but it really made for a balanced taste.   Obvious the veggies were fresh which is wonderful and adds great flavor. Have no doubt this is a winner.   We are also falling for the thin new York crust,   just great."

The only pizza the whole family could agree on.  We also always order the antipasto salad. I think I like it more than the pizza- or should say did.  We ordered our usual tonight and something tasted off with the salad.  My husband noticed also, before I even asked him.  I called up to the shop and a nice young man listened carefully to what I said and asked if I could hold.  I was a little worried that something in the salad was &#34;bad&#34;.  Luckily when he reported back nothing was expired but they had switched the ham they are using in the salad. The young man took my name and said they would call if they changed the ham back to the original. I was very impressed with they way the situation was handled.  But so so bummed about the change.

Pizza came out very late because they actually forgot to put our order in. At least they apologized, but then I overheard them make similar apologies to other customers. That&#39;s troubling.

Garlic knots were undercooked. Sauce was watery. Actually, the only thing we enjoyed was the chicken Cesar salad, strangely enough -- not the pizza.

We will be back at some point and hopefully see that last night was a fluke. Otherwise, izza no good for me."

I sure was anxious to try the place! Overall, it was good and I hope to come back, although my partner was &#34;meh&#34; about the pizza. I started with a tossed salad which was disappointing on two accounts: It was watery at the bottom. Ugh. And none of the dressings available are homemade. How hard is it to mix together olive oil, red wine vinegar, a few pinches of herbs like oregano and basil and a bit of salt and pepper?... The pizza itself was delicious. We ordered one ingredient, Italian sausage, and I did enjoy it... Parking is right in front of the place, which is mighty appealing. And one nice touch was the old-school paper bag to hold the leftover slices on a simple paper plate. Erin, our server, was quite attentive and made our experience enjoyable."

The pizza is NY style and although I was born and raised in Chicago I can love NY style pizza and this is the BEST.  We&#39;ve tried the veggie, pepperoni and cheese  and it never disappoints.

Although this shop has been open for a short time, it has built a huge following.  If you like thin New York style pizzas (and you&#39;re in Naperville) this is the place.  Their pricing is very affordable.

A trick I learned (when they are super busy and the wait times are long) I ask them to reserve a few pre-cooked slices for me.  Then when I show up they are all worked up and ready to go -- minimal wait (as long as you like what they happen to have already there pre-made).

Sides are good too, especially the garlic balls and mozzarella sticks."

I FOUND MY BELOVED NY STYLE PIZZA HERE IN NAPERVILLE. Actually, let&#39;s be fair. Chris L. found it and kindly sent me a message, noting in my other pizza reviews that I hadn&#39;t yet been sated here in our little suburb. BUT NO LONGER, FRIENDS.

The same damn DAY I received Chris&#39; message, I got home and told my husband we HAD to try it. He agreed, and we quickly ordered a large pizza, half pepperoni, half sausage. We live way too far for delivery, so we drove on over to pick it up (side note: is naperville not the MOST confusing sometimes? Like on what planet do I drive from Naperville, through Lisle, to get to a place in Naperville? Who even knew this location was technically Naperville? Does Naperville actually ever end, or can you end up in like, Naperville Alaska? Because seriously. So much Naperville).

When we drove up, I was pensive. It&#39;s a reeeeeal hole in the wall looking place and is not exactly pretty. BUT, I was here for my NY style pizza. The place can look however it wants. When the hubs got the pizza into the car, it smelled heavenly. I was getting pumped.

We made the long trek (haha ok 16 min trek but WHATEVER) back home and, I opened the box in awe. YES. THIS WAS IT. Thin floppy crust! Huge triangular slices! YES!!! I took a bite - and it&#39;s delicious, too! It&#39;s foldable, it&#39;s cheese, it&#39;s amply topped with your choice of ingredient - it is RIGHT. I don&#39;t need to order pizza from anywhere else. I&#39;ve finally found it. My fat kid sojourn has come to a close. I damn near ate half a pizza.

P.S.: just in case huge cheesy slices of greasy delicious pizza aren&#39;t enough gluttony, take my word and order the fried dough with cannoli filling and chocolate drizzle. It&#39;s like a freakin diabetes chimichanga and $%*T it is so GOOD. It&#39;s soft, it&#39;s crispy, it&#39;s literally oozing delicious, sweet cannoli filling. Omg. So good. So very good.

Thank you, Naperville. Thank you for being boring enough for me to maintain my quest for perfect pizza but interesting enough for me to find it. Thanks for having Chris L.&#39;s who alert you to delightful NYC pizza. Thanks for being weird and windy and seemingly having Lisle in the middle of you and THANK YOU for Little Pop&#39;s Pizza because it is a delicious thing."

We ordered the White Pizza which is hands down the best white pizza we&#39;ve had - better than Pal Joeys which makes theirs too greasy or Lou Malnati&#39;s (you can sub olive oil and garlic for tomato sauce on any non deep dish) which lacks any flavor. Little Pop&#39;s puts on the right amount of oil and garlic to give you flavor balance with the ricotta and mozzarella on top. We ordered ours for delivery and the crust underneath was nice and chewy and not a bit of grease! Perfect!  

We also ordered the zeppoles which were great- totally reminds me of a cart vendor in little Italy in Nyc I always get zeppoles from!  

Also got mozzarella sticks which are thinner than Lou Malnati&#39;s but are much better - they&#39;re crisper and more balanced. 

They were half and hour late on delivery but called in advance and let us know they weren&#39;t happy with our pizza and were making a new one for us. Sent us some awesome brownies and fried mac and cheese  for free and we couldn&#39;t have appreciated it more! Believe me the wait was worth it. They&#39;re. A family business and it shows in the product. 

No you can&#39;t get  three pizzas for $15 here but the one you get is much better quality and I&#39;ll pay for quality over quantity anytime.

Understand that I think a lot of the high ratings are based on the notion that locals ABSOLUTELY LOVE the idea that this is in the middle of their neighborhood.  It is a unique strip mall in the middle of several subdivisions, off of two smaller roads (not main arteries).  This is basically why I love the place.  They recently opened a dining room as well.  They are not full service (I&#39;d bet they will be in time)- you order at the counter, sit in the restaurant side (or wait in the carry out side) &amp; they&#39;ll bring the food to you.
The food:
We&#39;ve had the beef sandwich, a cheesy bread (I forget what they call it), salads and pizza.  The pizza is quite good, though a bit pricey (no more so that other comparable places, but much more than chains obviously). The beef sandwich is a bit unique (toasted bread?) and it is HUGE (for the regular size).  It is really for 2.  Is it as good as Bueno or Portillo&#39;s?  No.  Is it good though?  Yes- a solid 4.  The cheesy bread was well received by my family and the salads were solid.  &#34;
They are a lovable management group (nice people- I hope for their success), but you can tell they are struggling with their fast growth.  They have trouble with orders and they take some time to get items out (carry out or in restaurant).  
All in all, they are great little place located in a sad little neighborhood strip mall.  The neighborhood has embraced this place- you might too..."

The service was definitely 5 stars.  The young lady behind the counter couldn&#39;t have been nicer.

The food is another story.  The garlic knots that everyone is raving about were hot and garlicky.  The interior was soft and undercooked, close to raw.  We got a minestrone and a pasta fagioli.  The minestrone was overpowered by some herb that we couldn&#39;t identify, maybe oregano or thyme.  The pasta fagioli was average at best.  Next we had two slices, one cheese and one sausage.  I was amazed that the sausage slice had almost no flavor.  The cheese slice had a little flavor but there was no pizza sauce on it except at the very outer edge.  Maybe the lack of sauce is why the sausage slice had no flavor.  The crust was thin and crunchy on both.  We still prefer Traverso&#39;s thin crust pizza to this one.

Note: Little Pop&#39;s is expanding.  The store front next to them has signs in the windows that say Little Pop&#39;s Coming Soon.  Also, Little Pop&#39;s currently has no adult beverages.  Maybe that will change when they expand.  I don&#39;t know how you can run an eat-in pizza place with no beer and wine."

It&#39;s all we ever get, and it just tastes horrible. Sorry to all of your native Chicagoans. I grew up in New Jersey and the pizza I grew up on is the pizza I prefer - greasy and delicious, cut in triangles, and not crackery.
So I decided to search Yelp to see if anything near work had some variety and I ran across Little Pops. Boy am I glad I ordered from here. First, the people were very nice. I called the night before to ask if I could order 8 pizzas when they first opened at 11:00 AM. They said they&#39;d be happy to. The next day, although the driver got a little confused about where we were, we got our delicious pizzas for lunch.
The staff raved about the pizza - and I had no idea how many former New Jersey and New Yorkers we have in the area. They all talked about how the pizza reminded them of the east coast. I agree! While it;s not 100% the real thing, it&#39;s a really good copy and definitely the best I&#39;ve had in the area. The slices are also humongous. I ordered way too many pizzas because each person ate one slice and was very full. So the price of the pizzas are totally worth it since they&#39;re so big and filling. The pizza also tasted good leftover, and I love me some cold pizza.
So Little Pops, I salute your dedication to bringing real pizza to the Chicagoland area. Please stay open forever, and I promise we will order again the next time we have a work function that requires unsucky pizza."

I really haven&#39;t had decent NY style in the Chicago suburbs. And I tried. I&#39;m ashamed to say I&#39;ve been resorting to Dominos Brooklyn style which is ok but not yummy. Enter Little Pops. 

I&#39;m gonna keep this short. I&#39;ve only ordered delivery from these guys. And they have straight-up great New York-style pizza. They deliver fast. Pretty reasonably price. I&#39;ve tried the sicilian, white pizza, garlic knots. Yeah, they&#39;re all good. The plain-jane cheese large pizza...it&#39;s a home-run. Sauce is great, slices are the same size, crust is yum-o. Is it the best NY style pizza ever? Probably not. For Chicago it&#39;s damn fantastic and I hope they keep churning them out. This may actually become a problem with me having them deliver every week. Too bad."

I ended up getting a slice of pizza and some garlic knots.  I also ordered cheesecake, but they didn&#39;t have any.

All and all the pizza and knots were ok.  I&#39;m leaving a 2-star rating for the unethical way in which I was lured to the restaurant.

There are only a few tables inside and 2 outside so don&#39;t expect a big restaurant! You can order either by the slice (huge!) or an individual pizza or pasta. 

We had: bacon chicken ranch-5 stars, spicy sausage-4stars...could have been spicier, cheese-4 stars cuz it just needed the extras but our daughter likes it plain, and the star of the show....THE WHITE pizza-5555 stars! It was amazing! We also tried the knots and they were ok, but a little heavy on butter....but really, I mean it&#39;s bread and butter so what should you expect? Oh, and the homemade Tiramisu....awesome and flavorful, and well worth saving room for! 

We looked over the menu and there are lots of things we&#39;d like to try in the future. Also, for parents of picky eaters...they have a good basic kids menu that fits everyone&#39;s needs. 

The staff were friendly and attentive! We waited just a short time for the food and it was perfect temp to eat! Hopefully they will consider delivering to us since we are a little further away because this may very well become our pizza night hot spot! 

Overall better than any chain pizza and better than many of our local pizza places! Welcome to Naperville Little Pops!"

Staff was friendly, everything looked clean, cute tables set up outside. Ordered 2 slices to go-cheese and margherita- and a chocolate chip cookie. 
Slices were on display and warmed per order. The portions were generous for the price. My little boys enjoyed most of them and I enjoyed the rest :) 
Love that chewy thin NY style crust and the sauce and cheese were good. Margherita was more exciting obviously and I&#39;ll definitely return to try their meat toppings as well. Special for the day was veggie lasagna which also sounded awesome and was priced well. I&#39;ll be back to try it!
Oh and the cookie was ok. Dried out, but good flavor, so I&#39;m sure they are great fresh. Homemade tiramisu is more tempting for next time!

From the first day we moved here I have been asking my hubby to take me here for a date night. Well fast forward to today and we are ready to move away. Before we fully move away we had a little time after some packing and decided to head here for a beer at the bar - you know, just so he could say he finally took me here - sweet isn&#39;t he? ;)

It was a Sunday night after the dinner crowd and only a handful of people at the bar. The place is really nice and trendy with the decor. I love it!

We glanced at the menu just to see if there was anything truly calling our names even though we weren&#39;t very hungry. Turns out nothing struck my fancy so we passed.

We asked the bartender what drink specials they had that night - because who doesn&#39;t love a deal? She told us they had Goose Island flights on special. We decided to each get one after she explained each beer. I liked maybe 2 of the beers out of the flight. My husband liked a couple as well. But we finished up and asked for the bill.

$48. Pre-tax. Yep. For two beer flights. That comes to $24 per flight folks. One flight equals one beer.

Yeah we weren&#39;t too happy. I know we asked for a special, but that usually implies it is cheaper. We paid and left. Never to come back again even if we continued to live nearby. 

Still stings thinking about being duped into paying $50 for a couple beers."

First: Staff is super friendly. Downloading their app nets $5 off your bill &amp; they graciously allow two people per table to use it

Second: Food was really good. We started with the grilled asparagus &amp; literally had to restrain ourselves from licking the rest of the hollandaise off the place. Then we shared the Prime Rib French Onion soup (good, but a bit salty-- best to dip other things in, like the steak) Finally we finished up with the Skirt Steak. Great flavor, cooked to the correct temperature. Loved it. 

The ambiance on the bar side is really cool. We wandered over to the other side (Trivia night was going on) but the lights were turned up &amp; we felt a bit out of place

Burgers looked absolutely amazing &amp; looking forward to trying that next time. Blend of chuck, short rib &amp; brisket = yummy goodness in my book.

There was a blues stage set up right outside their front door on Cass Avenue.  So we were able to have some beers and listen to the blues from their outdoor seating, protected from the sun.

Our server said they were known for their burgers so I ordered one.  And I quickly understood why.  It was perfectly prepared.  A great piece of meat and the bun was bakery fresh.  I also ordered their chips instead of fries and they were very good.

TIP: If you are a Blue Moon drinker they don&#39;t carry it.  But they do have Allagash White which is also a smooth beer."

I am not one to go off the beaten path with food, but let me tell you that the short rib grilled cheese was amazing. I enjoyed their sweet potatoes fries as well, hearty but not super potatoey. I split this with my friend and had half a Cobb salad. I have had better Cobb salads, but I liked that this one included chopped greens. Disappointed they did not have feta to replace the Bleu cheese crumbles, but was still delicious. Tried their nutty Mexican cocktail and it was perfect for a light but dessert type drink. Service was excellent and the atmosphere is fun. I think some music would be a nice addition to play. Something instrumental to add to the atmosphere."

The tortillas were fresh and delicious- made in house, I hear! The tacos were a little small, and we were contemplating another order after we finished, but made ourselves hold off. 

Service here was friendly and efficient. They have great beer, cocktail, whiskey (strong emphasis) and wine options. When I selected a breakfast stout, the waiter said it was his favorite, and it was good. It seems like they&#39;d be able to help you out if you needed! 

The decor is that perfect shabby/chic/country vibe that is so trendy and cute. I really enjoyed how they recycle old whiskey bottles as the water containers for each table too. Great eco friendly idea!

Our faves are the onion soup, short rib grilled cheese (sinful), and their cheesesteak (I&#39;m not from Philly so I can&#39;t guarantee authenticity, but SO delish). Our daughter is addicted to the mussels (always served with plenty of broth and grilled bread). Tacos are delicious w house-made tortillas that don&#39;t get soggy and split while you eat them. (On Taco Tuesdays they offer them for $2/each!) I generally love fries but rarely in restaurants bc they either overthink them or underseason them. Not the case at Neat; both sweet and regular potato fries are simple and perfect as-is. Great food, great staff, great service, and adequate parking."

The set up is a bit strange.  It isn&#39;t a large, open concept.  You have to sort of zig zag to get to the bar area.  The bar itself appears unfinished and not at all cozy.  The server behind the bar was actually extremely friendly and attentive but lacked knowledge.  They also did not give us water, which isn&#39;t a huge deal as we didn&#39;t ask for it but at this price point, I expect to just have that automatically.  The wine list by the bottle looked good but this isn&#39;t really a &#39;by the bottle&#39; type of place.  By the glass they had price points that are the same as downtown.  For example, Kim Crawford is the exact same as you&#39;ll find at most places downtown.  Overall I felt the price point was a bit strange for the quality of food.

We ordered the pork belly buns, the pork wings and 5 spice pork.  Yes, I realize pork heavy but not abnormal for what we typically order.  The pork belly buns were definitely the biggest let down.  There was literally almost no meat in them (see picture).  Also, the hoisin sauce should have been put all over the pork as opposed to just in the bottom of the bun.  It led to very uneven bites.  The ratio of bun was way, way off.  The buns themselves were bland and chewy whereas they typically are light and fluffy.  We asked what the difference was on the 5 spice to a banh mi.  The server had never heard of a banh mi nor knew how to explain to us the difference.  It&#39;s not like that&#39;s something extremely exotic and, as someone in the food and beverage industry, I would assume it&#39;s something that should be known.  For the record, this sandwich is a banh mi, in case anyone is looking to try it.  If they just called it that, it would probably help people to understand what it was.  The sandwich itself wasn&#39;t bad but the fries that came with it were completely flavorless.  The redeeming dish was the pork wings but they were legs, not wings.  We didn&#39;t care but I could see some people looking specifically for wings to be upset.  The skin was crispy and the sauce had a nice spice to it.  However, putting it on cabbage that isn&#39;t even dressed (literally just dry cabbage) was a huge miss.  Had it not been for that, I&#39;d give that dish itself a four.  It is the only dish I would get again.  The service was good and very friendly and the pork &#39;wings&#39; were solid, which is the only reason for two stars but I would not recommend."

I looked at the reviews and decided this would be the place to go!

I love their decor. Trendy, huge bar, Edison lights, I could spend a long time here. They have a HUGE list of beers (mostly bottled, but they do have some on draft), whiskey, wine, and cocktails. I went with a beer on draft, and my dad went with a bottled beer and tried a whiskey.

Their menu is interesting. I would consider it to be upscale bar food, with an Asian influence. I had a hard time choosing what I wanted to eat! We ordered the mussels as an appetizer, and each ordered a burger for an entree (I had the Neat burger). The mussels were good, I had had broths that were better...but this one was definitely not bad. It was more buttery. They don&#39;t give you a lot of extra broth to dip your bread in. The burger was good - the duck egg is definitely a different flavor from anything I have had before. Tastes more eggy than a chicken egg. The burger was cooked perfectly. It was a little salty for my taste, but still good.

Our server was very nice and attentive. They made sure to fill our water and clear plates. We were never waiting on our server. We were seated right away, and they were willing to help me find the bathrooms. No complaints with service!"

We went there with a fairly big group about 12 people. I feel our server kind of ignored us at times; maybe she thought we wouldn&#39;t tip well or something. Just be aware they run out of things quickly. I had ordered a beer and apparently the tap had just went dry, no biggie it happens. But then when I went to order food I had asked for their bison burger and they had just run out of that too. I had ordered another burger which was still good and the sweet potato fries were worth the extra 2 bucks. I would&#39;ve given this place 5 stars of it wasn&#39;t for them running out of things so quickly I feel they were a little unprepared in some aspects.

There&#39;s a parking lot, which makes getting here easy.  There isn&#39;t a lot in downtown Westmont, but Neat is a worthwhile destination.  Although the food menu is smaller, everyone was happy with what they ordered.

The Short Rib Grilled Cheese was delicious, I would definitely eat this again.  The fries were ordinary - if you like sweet potato fries, order those instead!  I ate one from my friend&#39;s plate and automatically had fry envy.  The fries were perfectly crispy on the outside and soft and potato-ey on the inside.

The wine and beer selection is outstanding.  I can&#39;t pass up anything with elderflower; there&#39;s an Elderflower Sparkling Wine on the menu that could not have been any better!  If you like sweeter wines, this one is a must try.  

Early in the evening there was a free wine sampling of three different reds.  Later in the evening there was live music, but the volume was well controlled and we were still able to hear each other talk.

I killed an afternoon here doing work (literally, I used their wifi), attempting to dominate one of their massive burgers, and enjoy a couple brews. 

Atmosphere: clean yet bar-based. Pretty much what you would expect from what seemed like the most foodie/ craft-brew focused place in this part of the Chicagoland &#39;burbs. I liked it.

Food: freaking amazing. I got the bison burger, and I would go out of my way to go back and get it again. Not to mention the french fries (which I normally don&#39;t find to be super appealing) were crazy good. 

Beer: longgggg list, I really wish I hadn&#39;t been working during my visit. Very random, from all over the country/ world. You can tell they take time to choose what they serve you. This matters to me. I was happy.

Service: these peeps are FRIENDLY! They were super accommodating with my crazy &#34;Can I keep my bike inside?&#34; request, and checked in on me regularly without being even somewhat over the top."

The burger was cooked to perfection for the most part of being medium rare and it did not fall apart at all! Hooray for that. It was delicious. The bacon dust should&#39;ve been on top as I didn&#39;t taste it at all... It was there tho salty as heck. Onion marmalade was fine. 

The tacos left me with disappointment for 12$. I easily could&#39;ve gotten a better dish at the patio or another fast food place for that price. There were like two shrimps which were small to begin with. Service is kind and friendly... Uncomfortable bench to sit on in the waiting area though.  It&#39;s ok. Nothing to special. The bill was still 32$. For three petty shrimpy tacos and a buuuuurger.  Much better than any other open late establishment...maybe if I could drink is have a different opinion of this place. 

I guess overall
They&#39;re deserving of 4 stars at least as this was a seriously excellent burger."

The beer selection - draft, can, bottle and cider - is extensive and can satisfy almost anyone&#39;s taste. The servers as a whole are extremely friendly and passionate about the dishes on the menu. You can build your own 10 oz. burger with any toppings you like on top of a patty made with ground chuck, short rib and brisket. The short rib grilled cheese is absolutely amazing comfort food, the chicken and apple sandwich offers an explosion of flavors, and the five spice pork sandwich is a star that no other restaurant like this offers.

The only negative thing I can say is that the main menu really never changes, though they do have different specials regularly. Make no mistake - this is a fantastic dining experience."

I drove by it about 3 times before I found it. The inside it set up interesting but it is cute. From other yelpers, I wanted to try the burger. The taste of the burger was excellent. Although it is excellent, I have had phenom burgers so they are only about a 3, which isn&#39;t bad. The presentation of the food is nice. Their fries tasted homemade, which paired up with the burger very well! The downside is, I ordered my burger medium and it was RED in the middle and very pink on the outsides. So basically, I ate around the middle. Today, I&#39;m not feeling too well, but I will not be that guy to blame the burger. 

The service was great. I had an extremely nice waitress! The restaurant is very open and it carries noise, so if this place gets packed, I can see it being very noisy. I will be back to try the chopped salad because it looks amazing. :) I&#39;ll give an update once I try it."

To start with, the food was pretty good. The wings were tasty but we thought $9 for 6 small wings was quite high.

The service was decent, and they were very good about refilling our drinks.
What we disliked the most was that the tables were so close together. I know they are sort of going for an &#34;urban&#34; vibe but I just don&#39;t like hearing my neighbors conversations. Plus the waiter kept sort of knocking into my husband when he would serve the table next to us."

I&#39;m a DJ in Chicago and had the pleasure of working there this past Saturday for a fundraiser. The parking was ample and load-in was extremely easy through the front door. From the moment I stepped in, I was welcomed by the lovely Molly, shown my space, and asked if I needed anything to drink. I loved that I was constantly loved and checked on, which made me feel like a guest, and not just a DJ. Their manager, Michael Cairo, really cares about connection and making people feel at home. It speaks volumes to be respected and seen in this way. Neat has delicious food options; my favorite was the buttermilk chicken sandwich and their cheeseburger, both well-created and delicious. I wish I had more space to eat more of their offerings, but I was full after a few appetizers (it was that good and filling). Here&#39;s the biggest take-away: At the end of the night, my equipment accidentally fell off my cart. Megan and Shannon saw what happened and immediately asked if I needed help. That right there is a huge testament to this restaurant&#39;s quality and standards as I was in need of help at that moment.

The service is always great as well. Especially my last visit. The waiter was the only worker for the restaurant and bar. You could tell he was working very hard and tried to keep up as much as he could. WHAT REALLY UPSET ME? ( why I am even writing this review) At one point the manager or owner came out from a different area and started talking to a guest. While he was standing there chatting he barked orders at the waiter who all ready was busting his ass to grab a beer. There were tables and the bar area that needed cleaning and customers that needed serving. But instead of the man helping out he talked down to his employee in front of costumers. Not okay really changed my view on the restaurant and how they treat the staff.

I was very interested in going back &amp; this visit did not disappoint! It was early afternoon on a Saturday &amp; we were greeted &amp; seated immediately. 

The menu seemed small but once I got to looking at it, I realized it was packed full of beautiful dishes.Their beer/wine/whiskey menu on the other hand is not small at all! I was overwhelmed by the endless possibilities &amp; the server was kind and asked if she could help in any way. Lady, when it comes to these decisions there is no helping me! LOL

We ordered the calamari to start. The batter was light, the calamari was not at all chewy &amp; the spicy mayo concoction it was served with was pretty yummy. In my opinion, the batter definitely could use a little salt &amp; pepper but my husband says I am crazy. Whatever, I like my salt, don&#39;t judge me. 

Not surprising at all, I was undecided for my entree sooooo we shared The Burger &amp; the short rib grilled cheese (with a side of brussel sprouts). The burger was quite possibly the BEST burger I have ever had! I am salivating thinking about it as I am typing! The seasoning &amp; mixture of meats they put together is just so delicious, I don&#39;t even know how to describe it. Definitely a must try when you go. 
The short rib grilled cheese was.. um, well, different. Not bad necessarily but different. There was a sauce or something on there that gave a weird after taste, Not really sure what it was but it didn&#39;t really set well with me. The side of sprouts had an asian fusion kinda thing going on... soy sauce &amp; ginger. Pretty good &amp; different from the bacon and onion norm. Here&#39;s a little secret though.. the ones that are at the bottom of the dish. sitting in all the juices.. yeah eat those first. Those are money!

With this comfortable place and nice flow of the conversation, we asked for more wine and the awesome berry bread pudding. The food was not the most important thing at this place. The atmosphere was relaxing and warm and comfortable.

The drinks are poorly made, I do better bartending in my kitchen. The prices for drinks are what you find at bars in the city, so they should really be good drinks if they&#39;re gonna charge that much in Westmont, but they&#39;re far from it. I ordered a flatbread with mushrooms and truffle oil that was pretty good. I also ordered tacos (shrimp, pork belly, and steak) that weren&#39;t good at all. Particularly bad was the steak and the pork belly. They tasted like dry old chips of meat were used. I could barely tell them apart. The hole-in-the-wall taco stand that sells tacos for $2 is a zillion times better than this place. Clearly the focus of Neat is the ambiance and being trendy, not quality. The audience they target are snobs with disposable income that they don&#39;t mind spending on ambiance instead of good tasting food and strong drinks."

When we were seated by the window, my first thought was &#34;Wow, it&#39;s drafty in here.&#34; We asked to be moved to a table that was more towards the center or back of the restaurant so that it was warmer. When we were seated at our new table in the center, it wasn&#39;t better at all. I sat there turning my head left, right, up and down wondering where the heck the draft was coming from. 

Atmosphere is very chill and kind of dimly lit. The tables and chairs are pretty spaced out from each other, and there&#39;s a big empty space in the middle between the entrance and the tables. 

It wasn&#39;t busy when we went, so we didn&#39;t have to share our server with a whole bunch of tables. He was pretty attentive but not to the point where he was breathing down our necks.

We ordered the Neat burger, three fish tacos and a side of asparagus. All three items were pretty good. The fish was just a tad bit on the dry side. So why the one star deduction? I chose this restaurant with the intention of ordering three shrimp tacos as listed on their website menu. Drove all the way to the restaurant and found out that their taco menu was almost completely different from the website! They need to update their website menu. I want my shrimp tacos! :(

Overall, I would recommend this place, but dress warmly when you come here in the winter."

1. They were able to accommodate our large group easily &amp; provide the attention we needed.  Great place to go with friends!  Friendly staff which is very important to me.  

2. Large craft beer selection. I was able to find a new standout beer here with some help after discussing my preferences. 

3. Great food.  I wish I could have tried everyone&#39;s meal but I couldn&#39;t.  I did  get my hands on a few things of course. I went with a healthy option &amp; ordered the salmon which was cooked perfectly &amp; seasoned well. My husband went with the Neat burger which I obviously tried &amp; I would dare to say is the best burger I&#39;ve ever had.  I had a bite of the short rib grilled cheese which was good too.  We also had the edamame &amp; calamari for starters which I enjoyed as well.  I think the standout of everything I tried would definitely have to be the burger.  I think it&#39;s difficult to find a good burger &amp; that is why I don&#39;t usually order them.  This one I would come back for.  I heard it was recently in the newspaper which I think it deserves.  

4. Enjoyable &amp; appealing atmosphere.  I would call it rustic contemporary.  The lighting is just right with enough over head light but not too much &amp; candlelight in mason jars on the tables. It is set up so you have enough space between other tables and don&#39;t feel cramped. There was a nice crowd but we could hear each other easily.  

We will definitely return in the future.  Next time we will try some new things but also be sure to get the burger."

Neat Kitchen did not disappoint! We started with the pork belly buns which were absolutely delicious. Then I had the asparagus with the fried duck egg. The egg was perfectly cooked and the asparagus grilled was charred but not too much . This was the highlight of my meal. I also ordered the pork wings because I had never had them but they were disappointing as they lacked flavor.
My husband ordered the crab cake with chorizo and corn saut√© it was very very good.  The grilled broccoli was his side and was good but nothing spectacular.
I was impressed with the wine by the glass list and the beer list. Overall this was a perfect place for good fast service, great food and good adult beverages! We would highly recommend Neat to anyone."

neat-kitchen-bar-westmont,Critic R.,GdIDWaVo5f_O-WorvOU69w,"Westmont, IL",0,1,0,0,73,uVRp0JGMDoRtKEkftC55OQ,5.0,2016-02-15,"OK, disclaimer, I like Neat a lot, and have been going here since they opened three or so years ago, so there is some bias in this review.  With that said, what is great about the place Jason and Mike run is that they are keeping it fresh with some changing menu items and now, recently, with developing their stock of bourbons which is just mind-bendingly awesome.

Starting with that, all you have to do is go up to the bar and ask to see the drink menu.  From beers on tap in bottles and cans, to wines and other spirits, they have so many you will lose count.  But the whiskey and bourbon list is amazing.  Best is, if you can catch Mike behind the bar, which is almost always, he will be more than happy to pour you a taste of almost anything, and will even set up a tasting flight so you can experience the differences between the different bottlers and batches even.  Honestly, its like being at a Kentucky distillery, and both Mike and Jason are passionate about their place and obviously take great pride in it.

This pride also shows in the food, both in quality and variation.  It is best described as an American Bistro, as they have a great selection of burgers and sandwiches, including the signature Neat burger with the fried duck egg, but they also offer a rotating variety of delicious appetizers and soups.  Try the beer and cheddar soup, a cold-weather favorite of mine.

For a great appetizer to share, get the pork wings in the sriracha or the Italian Speck.  The tacos (especially the steak) are also a great alternative if you are just grabbing a bite at the bar and a bourbon - trust me.

Don&#39;t worry about the service, it is great.  Al the servers, even the new ones, are knowledgeable and prompt.  And as a sign of a well run place, they have some long-standing servers, too. 

Desserts are also a treat here since the owners partnered with the former pastry chef of a failed patisserie down the street - she really makes delicious desserts, especially the bread pudding (though I will admit, the bananas foster bread pudding at Tally&#39;s in Clarendon Hills is unrivaled as far as I&#39;m concerned).

Grades:  Ambiance:  A (industrial chic but comfortable); Food A-Minus; Service - B-Plus; Booze - A.  Overall - A-Minus."

Nothing thrills me more than finding a great new restaurant, especially when it is close to home and Neat Kitchen + Bar is just that.  

The d√©cor is simple and earthy, a great place for a casual gathering with large tables that can easily accommodate big groups and parties.  The service from the minute we walked in was friendly and attentive.  

Their small but wonderfully imaginative and diverse menu has something for everyone, apps, sandwiches, steaks, fish, chicken, pasta and dessert.  Their wine and craft beer lists are long as well.  Tonight we ordered a bottle of pinot noir and Esteban, our excellent waiter told us about  1/2 price wine bottles on Wednesday (calendar noted!).

We started with their Prime Rib Baked Onion soup - a very large serving of cheesy onion broth with plentiful chunks of tender prime rib.  Our entrees included their Neatburger and the Short Rib Grilled Cheese.  Both were excellent but I have to say the burger (topped with a fried duck egg) was one of the best we&#39;ve ever had - ever!!  

As if the wine and food wasn&#39;t enough, we decided to order dessert and landed on the Triple Berry Bread Pudding with Burnt Caramel Ice Cream.  Do NOT miss this dessert - I know you will be tempted by many others on the menu that sound delicious but believe me - this is the one to try!

Neat Kitchen + Bar will end up on my &#34;Best of 2013&#34; list for sure!"

They have several taco options, sandwiches and burgers, some entrees and salads, and great desserts. We tried three- we loved the pot du creme and the bread pudding. I very much enjoyed the neat burger (with duck egg and shallots, on an impressively good bun). They also had a healthy beer list and a huge whisky/scotch/bourbon/rye selection. We had a great time. 
One drawback: very, very loud. There are no sound baffles, and by the end of the night it was much less crowded, but we were still yelling to be heard across our table. As awesome as the food is, they could use an interior designer to refine their look, inside and out, and advise on adding some sound dampening.

The French onion soup was almost inedible. The tuna nachos on special were decent but they could work on presentation. The NEAT burger was super tasty but once again the saltiness of the fried shallots atop the burger was BEYOND salty. We both left hugely disappointed and THIRSTY!

Apparently the secret that was NEAT is no longer a secret.  Went Friday night with my wife for a little casual dinner.  Came in around 6:30 to watch the Blackhawks and sat at the bar.  When we left the place was packed and people were waiting.
The place has a hipster feel - but more of an inviting way for the suburban clientele.  Not pompous or snobby like most of the downtown restaurants of this genre.  Many 30 &amp; 40 somethings.  Lots of specialty whiskeys and some good drink choices plus a decent selection of craft beers.  My wife likes plain old Miller Lite and they served it up without the attitude you might get at other places.

Menu is not huge, but has a good variety and some things that you might not normally order - but is worth taking the chance.  At the bar, lots of people were having the tacos.  Several proteins to choose from included shrimp, fish and a couple of pork options.  I love the tacos, but ordered a burger - after getting a pre-order food envy from a bar stool neighbor.  Burger was huge and tasty.  Ordered it Medium and it came in kind of rare, but it was still really good.  My wife had a rigatoni dish that was also good.  For the benefit of this review, I HAD to try it!

There were two bartenders that were large and in charge.  It seemed that every barstool was dining, so they were kind of doing double duty for the bar as well as handling the service bar.  Seemed like they had it under control.  The back wall of the bar has a bar to ceiling shelf wall of whiskeys and other specialty spirits.  At one time one of the bartenders pulled a step ladder to climb up on the back counter to reach for a true top shelf bottle.  You don&#39;t see that as most places.

We have been there several times and had enjoyed each visit.  There are not to many options in this style or segment in the western &#39;burbs.  It seems the secret is out and at least on weekends, this place is hopping!"

We were looking for something in the area for dinner and saw all the reviews and the ratings, we thought we&#39;d finally give it a shot. Hands down, the absolute best burger I have eaten in a very very long time. They cooked it exactly how we asked--medium rare. Not overcooked or undercooked at all.  Perfect. It&#39;s so hard to do, but they did it. And the burger was so flavorful. We were trying to figure out what the seasonings were. 

Excellent list of beers.  We also got a frisee salad, which was done perfectly as well. As good as one would get at a french bistro.  And we got the pork belly tacos. Those were good. But I think we were so full that we could not enjoy it.  

Overall, I would definitely be back for more burgers and beer."

We decided to come eat here after sampling some of their delicious cuisine at the Taste of Westmont festival. 

The 10oz burger was fantastic with fresh, juicy sirloin perfectly cooked with homemade buns and tasty cheddar cheese. The fries were some of the best I&#39;ve ever had and it definitely did not disappoint. You also have your choice of chuck, rib-eye or short-rib and they will add pretty much anything you want. Everything is homemade, even the mayo! Wonderful.

The pork belly tacos were absolutely my favorite part. They were tender, sweet and sour and probably the best I&#39;ve ever had. You MUST ask for the green sauce! I&#39;ve never had pickled cucumber before, and this made me a believer. 

The &#34;brick-chicken&#34; was fall-off-the-bone tender and covered in a super tangy but sweet sauce with grape tomatoes and crispy &#34;brocollini&#34;. They marinate it for 24 hours and you can definitely tell the difference. Full of flavor.

The calamari was, hands down, the best I&#39;ve ever had. I highly recommend. They don&#39;t bring out marinara sauce but the horseradish chilli sauce they do offer is a nice change and I actually preferred it to the usual marinara.

I absolutely recommend saving room for dessert and our waitress recommended the bread pudding with gelatin and it was stock full of cranberries and raisins and it was like eating fruitcake at Christmas time with more flavor and better fruit. 

Everyone was friendly, inviting and knowledgeable about the menu, ingredients  and kept our water and drink glasses filled. We really felt comfortable and I love how it is within a block of my buddy&#39;s house. Excellent work, Neat! Keep it up!"

Relaxed atmosphere, friendly staff, mellow ambiance, and fitting background tunes have led to great experiences had by the wife and I. Huge craft beer list, specialty cocktails, and vino galore are just some of the things we look for in our favorite hangouts, and they&#39;ve got them. Food has been above reproach during our visits, and quite possibly some of the best offerings we&#39;ve ever had. The FRIED CALAMARI is solid. Lightly breaded and cooked to tender magnificence. No chew whatsoever, and accompanied well with their spicy mayo. Their &#34;BURGER&#34; is ridiculous, comprised of ground chuck, short rib, and brisket...add a slice of cheese, order it medium, and trust me you&#39;ll be happy. The meat is throw your head back juicy, popping with flavor, and seasoned to perfection. SPROUTS had more of an Asian-inspired spin, boasting soy sauce, ginger, and lemon. Grilled and sauteed until tender, seasoned well and near void of common bitterness.There was some inconsistency with the bigger pieces...to be expected I suppose. The SHORT RIB GRILLED CHEESE is a bit of a head scratcher. I think there&#39;s a bit too much going on within the walls of pressed bread. Sweet yet sour, rich and briny, there&#39;s a lot of contrast in the ingredients. Not sure that the combo of sweet meat, tart onion, and creamy Fontina achieved quite the levels we hoped. A good sandwich no doubt, but a change in accoutrement could bring it to new heights. Atmosphere, vibe, drinks, food...Neat Kitchen has everything going for it. Prices are right but believe me, drinks and dinner for two will set you back a bit. Don&#39;t check in on a budget, try something new (I will!), and enjoy!"

The menu was a simple slip of paper thought he offering all looked very enticing. My coworkers go hamburgers (nice presentation and they looked deliciously plump) while I went for the cochinita pibil tacos as I was curious as to how their version compared to mine along with some fried brussel sprouts on the side.

If you want to know, the pibil tasted just as it should though achiote is a distinct flavor that you may or may not enjoy. My only complaint of the meal was that the tacos were very very barebones. They were served with a  single small corn tortilla and a bit of meat and pickled onions. As I know how much that meal costs to make I would definitely say it was priced a bit high. It would have been nice to have some sort of side dish to round the meal out (which is why I felt the need to order the sprouts! Which I am glad I did otherwise I would have left hungry).

The food was pretty good and I would happily visit this establishment again though it does seem to be a bit more expensive than it should."

I have a theory. I found this place because of their 4.5 star ratings and expect some near perfect dining experience. I didn&#39;t like anything I ate the first time I came here. I didn&#39;t dislike the food, but there was no reason for me to return. We started off with spicey pork wings and I ordered a blue cheese burger. The pork wings tasted like pieces of pork. They were nice and tender but nothing special. I didn&#39;t like the blue cheese burger but that is because I realized I don&#39;t like blue cheese inside of burgers so take this with a grain of salt if you are a big blue cheese burger fan. 

The 2nd time I decided to give this place a shot was for carry out. Nothing I ordered had good quality. I ordered their flagship &#34;neatburger&#34; and I thought it was meh. It had a bunch of fancy ingredients in it like fried duck egg and kewpie but it tasted like any old burger. In fact, it tasted worse than any old burger because they did not cook the meat to my specifications of medium. The meat patty was a definite bloody and bitter medium rare. That&#39;s right, BITTER. I never associated meat with being bitter before but both of the burgers I have had there were bitter. I also ordered a side of asparagus. DO NOT ORDER ASPARAGUS AS A SIDE HERE! My imaginary pet rabbit wouldn&#39;t be starved if I fed it Neat&#39;s portions of asparagus. It&#39;s nearly $1 per asparagus."

The food was a great. I enjoyed the little play on the comfort foods. The Pork wings... (yeah you read that right) were awesome, so good and I couldn&#39;t wait to take a bite of my friends short rib grilled cheese. 

I did have one complaint and that the dessert portions were small. Our party size was 6 and we usually get a couple desserts to share and when they showed up at the table I was curious if our waiter ate half of it on the way to the table. Man, were they small. Now, they were tasty and delicious but way too small. Other than the bread pudding everything else was one or two bites at most.

The atmosphere and decor are also superb. 

The only drawback is that at times the service can be a bit lackadaisical.

Because I couldn&#39;t get my teeth through it, I had the choice of either swallowing it whole or spitting out, and I chose the latter, discreetly.

Meanwhile, my companion was served a delicious looking burger with pieces of wire in it.  The manager apologized, laughingly saying that they&#39;d &#34;get the chef a new SOS pad&#39;, and a replacement burger was brought out. Unfortunately, my companion was unable to eat it because his appetite was now gone. We just wanted to pay the check and go home, but the server unexpectedly brought us a triple-berry bread pudding -- we hadn&#39;t ordered it so I&#39;m guessing it was intended as some kind of an apology.  We really didn&#39;t want anything else from the kitchen and just wanted to leave, so we didn&#39;t eat that either.  We asked for the check.

When the check arrived, it included a charge for the wireburger.  They removed the charge when we requested they do so, but the chef came out and leaned against the bar, glaring at us while we waited for the revised check, and while we paid it.  Not cool.

There are lots of places in the western suburbs offering great selections of craft beer and great food.  If you want both, this isn&#39;t the place for you."

I had the burger on the first visit and tacos the second time. Excellent selection of beers and a nice bar. Only suggestion is to add either a turkey or vegetarian option for the burgers which are clearly the popular items on the menu. I will be back!

I&#39;ve been there a handful of times and  have never been disappointed. The setting is pretty nice, a bit dim and comforting with great servers.

The pork belly appetizer is a full-fledged flavor party in your mouth. There&#39;s nothing I could suggest to improve it. I&#39;ve also had the regular burger and it is so juicy and delicious that you won&#39;t even reach for ketchup. 

The absolute best thing on the menu is the Neat Burger. It comes open-faced with a fried duck egg sitting on top of the burger side like a beautiful work of art. The other side of the bun is covered with crispy shallots. When you combine the two sides and take your first bite it is like when all the Captain Planet kids&#39; powers combined.

Combine the delicious food on the menu with a very tempting cocktail list (try any of the whiskey concoctions if you are looking for some punch), scotch and bourbon flights, and an impressively diverse and imposing beer list for a must-visit new restaurant."
neat-kitchen-bar-westmont,Carol K.,ZYZNcugF3xUEGyLOVGiZ0Q,"Chicago, IL",1,1,1,1235,15,8xFf5Vt3gZhX9QcM8xSmVA,3.0,2013-11-27,"We were looking for a new place out in the burbs for a &#34;girls night&#34; and NEAT fit the bill in terms of location and menu so off we went to check it out.

While the d√©cor is a bit Spartan (I think they were going for a minimalist approach), the friendly greeting that we got from Ben the bartender was not, so we cozied up to his bar for a couple of very well poured martinis while we waited for the rest of our party to arrive.  Ben was great . . so great so that we even came back to the bar after dinner for a nightcap.

On this weeknight- there were not many people in the place so once we were all there- someone showed us to our seat.  Turns out the person that showed us to our seats might have been a food runner or busser as he was back at our table several times throughout the night. And while I appreciate him seating us, the server for our area seemed to be a bit flustered as she said she didn&#39;t know what we were doing in her section and given we had been waiting for about 20 mins for someone to come over and wait on us we didn&#39;t care why- we just wanted a server.   Service hiccup number one.

Hmm . . . . .I was hoping this wasn&#39;t going to be a portent of things to come.  

We reviewed the menu and there were quite a few things that caught our eye so we ordered a couple of appetizers to start like the Mussels (quite good) as well as the 3 taco sampler (they come with chicken, steak or pork and while all were good- the steak is clearly the winner!).

For our entrees- one in our group had the chicken and apple sandwich and the rest of us had the salmon.  The salmon was delicious- perfectly prepared and served over a bed of jicama cilantro coleslaw that was really a nice complement.

So the 2nd service hiccup came when the server brought us over another bottle of the wine we were drinking.  We hadn&#39;t ordered another bottle but when we questioned it she said &#34;oh, the owner probably sent it over&#34;, which made little sense to us but we rationalized it that one in our group was planning a big holiday event at the restaurant so maybe it was a way for him to thank her for the extra business.

Just after we got done talking about how thoughtful a gesture that was, the server came back and &#34;no- that was a mistake.  There is no free wine&#34;.  Really?  At that point- they would have been better off offering us something- a free glass of wine or a free dessert or something because all this service gaff did was leave us all talking about how poorly the mistake was handled.  And given the bottle of wine we were drinking was only priced at $40 (I drink this wine all the time and know the retail is about $20) it probably would have been a worthy investment.

All in, dinner for 3 with wine and dessert ran only about $140 so the prices are really reasonable given how tasty the food is.  If you like beer- they have quite an extensive list and their wines are reasonably priced as well.  And there is plenty of free parking in their private lot or on the street out in front of the location.

Good food but in my opinion the service still needs some fine tuning at this place.  Because there was nothing &#34;NEAT&#34; about it!"

I love the atmosphere, the people and the food.  Their &#34;Neat Cocktail&#34; menu is great.  My favorite is the St. George Raspberry Bramble.   Definitely recommend trying it. 

I&#39;ve never had a bad thing to eat here until today.... I actually want this review to inform people rather than discourage.  I ordered the calamari today and was very disappointed.  My concern is is that if it is someone&#39;s first time here and this is what they order I don&#39;t want them to be disappointed or let down in the food over all.  The calamari was just ok... I was surprised by how bland it was actually because of how great the rest of the food is. I&#39;ve tried most of the Menu and everything is wonderful. The calamari just doesn&#39;t fit. Very bland. Under cooked. The only thing that remotely saved it was the dipping sauce. If they spice up the calamari it would be a perfect menu all around. 

Over all love love this place and definitely recommend it to all my friends and family."

Every time I venture out of the food desert in which I reside (waiting anxiously for when my lease is up in May!!), I&#39;m happily surprised at what I discover. Neat is the perfect kind of neighborhood spot that offers great food and a nice selection of wine and craft beer in a setting that somehow manages to meld urban chic with suburban charm.

To start, alongside a chalice of Victory Golden Monkey, which, frankly, was just decent and did not at all resemble a true Belgian tripel (not Neat&#39;s fault), I enjoyed a French onion soup with hearty nuggets of braised prime rib and a gooey floating raft of Swiss and Muenster. I wanted more green apple in my grilled chicken sandwich with chipotle mayo, but it was still delicious. Next time, I&#39;ll ask. I hope there&#39;s a next time. The BF loved his Neat Burger with a fried duck egg, and we both devoured our crispy, golden shoestring fries ... we normally can&#39;t stand shoestring fries.

For some reason, previous reviewers expressed qualms about dressing casually here, but don&#39;t worry. All the staff wear shorts or jeans and Neat logo T-shirts, so come as you are. It&#39;s more fun when you do, anyway."

What a pleasant surprise! Drinks were great we had Bloody Marys (had a kick which I like ) and hubby had gum ball head on tap... Yes I wrote that ! I also had a beer flight (4 total). For dinner we had the burgers, I usually don&#39;t do a burger but was in the mood, we also had calamari which came with an aoli sauce and not marinara. 

Long term I hope they offer more flight options as I love to sample my beer and more apps. Beer and apps- a good thing. Hopefully they have happy hour come summertime too!  Overall great spot to try ! Enjoy. We will be back;)"

The area is very nice, but it just doesn&#39;t seem like a culinary hot spot. Well, I was wrong. Neat was fantastic!
I came with husband and brother-in-law on a Saturday night and were able to get a seat, but the place was busy. Service was great and the place is upscale, but certainly not fancy shmancy. 
My favorite part was definitely the beer selection. Dozens of options and a very solid wine menu and custom cocktails. I stuck with the beer, but the guys got some great cocktails and whiskeys.
We were starving, so we opted to split a variety of plates instead. The 3 each of the Fish, Pork Belly and Pork Pibil tacos, the spicy wings and then the short rib grilled cheese.
The tacos = awesome. Great flavor and a hearty portion of meat in each one... I passed on the wings since I&#39;m not a fan of a ton of heat, but the short rib grilled cheese was the winner... and those fries! Fantastic. For $14 this is not a grilled cheese for your kids, but it was so good. I&#39;ll definitely be back here when visiting the in-laws again. Definitely a place to bring visitors to!"

Yes, the food is a bit pricier, but you&#39;re paying for some creativity and some added quality ingredients too. We&#39;ve always been quite happy with the service, the beer list is amazing. We enjoy the tacos a lot and have tried almost all of them by mixing them and ordering as a starter. I would agree with other reviewers that the appetizers can be a little pricey. We&#39;ve ordered the short rib sandwich and the neat burger with the fried egg and both are mouth watering and delicious, and the portions for the price and quality are appropriate.

This is a great place to take friends, but also if you&#39;re looking for a modern date night feel without feeling too fancy or too casual. Love the ambience."

The atmosphere is laid back, and it&#39;s very open and rustic looking. Both times I have been to Neat, I&#39;ve ordered the tacos. I had one of each-chicken, fish, and steak-and all were absolutely delicious. I also had the bruschetta appetizer, which I would recommend. Other people I went with ordered the cobb salad and the burger, and they loved it! Neat has a smaller menu, but that is because they do everything on that menu really well, and each item has its own special twist of flavor that you might not expect. They also have a large beer menu which is perfect for lovers of craft beer. 

The service was awesome, and I love the waitress, Ellie, who I had both times I was there. She&#39;s wonderful, and suggested Allagash White beer to me after I couldn&#39;t decide what to get, and it&#39;s my new favorite summertime beer!

Also, both times I went to Neat, I was there for a Musician&#39;s Workshop, and the live music really added to the laid back atmosphere of the restaurant, which I loved.

When they finally put tvs in here I think that this place will be super popular, although I think the bar will be too small - put some more seats in please!!

I was excited to have my husband try the extensive craft beer menu as well. We started out with the fried calamari which was interestingly mushy. We moved on to entr√©es where I had the fish taco and my husband had the special for the night, stuffed burger. My fish taco was gross. It was dripping, soggy and all I could taste was the corn tortilla it was wrapped in. The burger had my husband spitting out pieces and asking me if there was something in his meat. He asked for medium rare and he swore the burger was not cooked at all. I couldn&#39;t try because I&#39;m pregnant and cannot have meat anything but well done. We each had sides of fries... fries that were soggy, oily and needed to stay in the fryer for another 2 min. 

We were crammed in between people and I felt smothered. We couldn&#39;t have a conversation without people next to us involuntary being able to hear us. Again, 9 months pregnant and the last thing I want is to not be able to move in and out of my seat. 

Our server was Molly and although pretty on top of it for most of service, she dragged toward the end. I wanted to try a dessert after seeing people next to me devour their&#39;s, but decided it wasn&#39;t worth another 10 min to figure out if she was going to come back. 

The ambience is nice. They did a great job with redecorating the place. I used to work at this joint when it was Brickyard Grill and looked nothing like what it does now. Would I return because it looks nice? Doubtful."

I was wrong. The food was amazing. Very fresh flavors, not greasy or over fried. This will be my go to place when I want Chinese food. Keep up the amazing job."

Pot of tea was hot with tea bags in the pot.
Hot and Sour Soup was so-so.
Egg Roll was perfectly fried but lacked an impressive filling.
Order Kung Po Chicken as a level set.  Chicken was tender.  More veggies, lot of celery, than I ever had in a Kung Po (bad thing).  Portion was served on 7 inch plate.  Large enough for a 200lb male but no left overs.  More rice than Kung Po  (70%/30%) on plate. 
Fried rice was not memorable.  
For $9 I will not be be going out of my way to return here.  

I am still looking for a favorite Chinese place in the Wheaton/Warrenville area."

They are fast and friendly. The food is great. I always enjoy getting their pan fried noodles with carrots and the waitresses go the extra mile to put jalapeno in them for me. Their fried rice is also very good.

I ordered on grub hub and was really hungry so I picked this place seeing it had a decent rating. I ordered the empress chicken as I am accustom with the dish along with some pot stickers. Well to refer to another review that i have now seen after eating the pot stickers were a mouthful of dough. The chucked was swimming in a sea of sauce with a bunch of over cooked vegetable and the tempura chicken was as soggy as a dish sponge. I didn&#39;t not even bother to finish any of it because sit was awful. Never mind the fact that they got lost looking for the address i provided. But i will say they have one thing going for them and thats the prepackaged fortune cookies lol.

It&#39;s one of those places that if you blink, you&#39;ll miss it. It&#39;s tucked in the 7-11 plaza right off Route 59. Tiny but adequate.

The decor inside was a little dated. It doesn&#39;t seem to be a place that does a ton of dine-in business. In fact, the bar seemed to be the happenin&#39; spot. I placed my order for the appetizers of shrimp toast and egg roll right there at the bar.

Prices weren&#39;t bad; they&#39;re in line with other local places. The service was quick less than ten minutes my order was ready.

So I took my order home and dug into the goodies. The shrimp toast were okay. I think by cutting them into 8 pieces instead of 4, they turned out a touch too greasy. But the egg rolls were awesome! Probably one of the top ten I&#39;ve eaten. It was cooked perfectly, flavorful and not greasy. Definitely a plus.

I will be back to try the entrees. I love the fact I can choose what size dish I want instead of the one size fits all of something I can&#39;t finish. I&#39;ll definitely add this to the list of my to-go Chinese restaurants."

The place is not very big which I prefer but they have a extensive menu and good food. The waitstaff was very quick moving around the tables and the bartender was very attentive. This is actually the first time I saw a bar in a Chinese place so I guess they serve some Chinese brand beer. They also have a very nice fishtank.

I can&#39;t quite fork out the 5 star rating because delivery is usually pretty inconsistent.. sometimes they&#39;re fast and sometimes they&#39;re so slow that I have to call to make sure they didn&#39;t forget about little ol&#39; me.

They have all the usual Chinese dishes.  Every time I come in there are a few people sitting at the bar, hanging out with the receptionists/waitresses (?).  The staff all seem very nice and never rush me even though I always order my food an hour within closing time.  Sorry and thanks!! haha."

The egg rolls are tasty and the service is second to none.  They are so sweet to us, patient while my mother dawdles over h food and quick to help me maneuver her wheelchair out the double doors.

And to us this place was an ultimate FAIL.  We ordered our food to go. We live a little less than 10 mins away and by the time we got home our food was cold. We ordered the Mongolian Beef and Hunan Shrimp. I specifically asked for both dishes to be spicy. But the Mongolian beef was more on the sweeter side than spicy (which I absolutely hated).  And for the Hunan Shrimp I requested not to have any water chestnuts but I guess they forgot and there was plenty in the dish. Both the dishes just didn&#39;t meet our expectation at all we ended up tossing it in the trash. Sorry..definitely not a place we&#39;d go back to again.

We did take out, which they said out be ready in 15 minutes, but it was more like 30 minutes.  The chop suey was incredibley small serving size, and was made with a can of &#34;la choy&#34; chineses vegetables (can do that at home,) and was a combinaiton of beef, chicken and shrimp; However, I did not recognize the chicken part of it (did not taste like anything....not sure what it was.)  The &#34;pot stickers&#34; were mostly dough and had pink colored meat inside with very strange taste to it.  The beef chow funn was a large enough serving (for $9.95 it should be,) and was ordered  extra spicy, but they put halopinos in it, which gave it an entirely different tasting hot (eyes watering...nose running.)  Normally, we would look forward to the left overs for the next day, but this time, we threw it out.

Conclusion: This was high priced, low qualtiy Chinese food. If you want good tasting Chinese food in Warrenville, go across the street  to China House."

east-china-inn-warrenville,Johnny G.,1ByswKsCK_Ca2THpqfAVRQ,"Mt Juliet, TN",0,1,0,10,26,WAjfbDL-lCi_0xwBEwf7dA,4.0,2009-12-25,"The Background:
* Don&#39;t confuse East China Inn as the China House. Very close proximity but not the same place.
* I live about 1/2 mile from ECI
* our family averages 1 meal a week from ECI but we have never dined in the restaurant.  This review is for take-out only.
* I initially wanted to give this place 3 stars based on my worldly travels as a chef but the reality is that we eat here a lot for a reason.

The Good:
* Large menu with lot&#39;s of choices.
* Food is always quick - and hot! Be careful I&#39;ve burned my tounge more than once.
* The standards are always well prepared and come in big portions.  I love the eggrolls here - they are a usually a unique combination of  vegetables with bbq pork and baby shrimps. The Large, almost overstuffed eggrolls are always crisp and flavorful as an appetizer it&#39;s a great place to start.
* Our usual order includes beef broccoli which is a nice balance of both vegetable and beef. The broccoli is always tender but sometimes undercooked (which I like) and the beef is very tender and flavorful.  
* For the adventurous try the beef chow fun.  It is a huge portion of fat rice noodles, green onion, and tender sliced beef in a rich, earthy blend of seasonings.  
* Standards such as Sweet and sour shrimp, sesame chicken, and fried rice are usually pretty good quality and execution - you can&#39;t go wrong staying on the safe side.
* Cheap food - my family of 4 usually averages about 20 bucks for dinner with plenty of leftovers for lunch the next day.  Recently we splurged on extra appetizers and soup for a whopping check total of 26 bucks.  (don&#39;t forget that 26 bucks is truly a dinner and a lunch).
* Convenience - I would guess that out of the thousands of cars that drive by on IL-59 hourly only a handful know about this place.  having said that, I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to recommend this place for a quick stop on the way home to feed the family.  I rarely have to wait long for my food and often I will call and arrive to find my food ready to take with me.
* The crab rangoon is a pretty decent rendition albeit a little bit on the cream cheesy side.  The wontons are stuffed to the max with the creamy filling and we find it to be a nice change of pace for our weekly order.
* Although I&#39;ve never been to the bar the Asian chicks that work here are friendly enough. At least that&#39;s the impression I get from the older, single male crowd that seems to hang out at the bar. Kinda reminds me of being in the PI back in my Navy days.
* Did I say cheap! and when I say cheap I really mean inexpensive.

The Bad:
* Although we&#39;ve never dined in the restaurant don&#39;t go here expecting to feel like your anywhere near the 21st century.  The decor is from about 1976 - remember the bicentennial year?
* Consistency - I&#39;d have to guess that the economy has been good to ECI.  Nowadays the place is pretty busy with take out orders - in the days just a couple of years ago when things were a little slower there were some consistency issues - I once had an eggroll a couple of years ago that had everything but the kitchen sink.  Getting rid of ingredients is an art form and if things ever slow down here you may get an off experience.
* Soups - my wife enjoys the egg drop soup but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s anything special. especially knowing that i only need three ingredients to make it at home.  The hot and sour soup is a pretty weak attempt and usually very inconsistent.  The hot and sour soup is where I&#39;ve found the kitchen using leftover ingredients the most.
* Fake condiments - I&#39;m partial to real soy sauce. skip the crap in the small packets including the hot mustard and non-brewed soy sauce. you&#39;ll be better off buying a bottle and keeping it on hand at your home.

All-in-all:
* We enjoy ECI at least once a week in our house.  The place is convenient, fast, somewhat consistent, and pretty good in the taste arena.  I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s the best Chinese I&#39;ve had (a very biased opinion since I lived in Hawaii for 3 years and dined throughout Asia including Hong Kong) but it&#39;s a great corner Chinese restaurant that I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to recommend for less than 5 bucks per person.  We&#39;ve used the delivery on occasions with no issues but as quickly as they prepare the food we like to pick it up and be home eating within 10 minutes."

Every time we tried before, they were busy. Today we got in before the crowd. We couldn&#39;t do the Nick burger because it&#39;s just too much burger, but the Mrs and I love Patty Melts and that was our choice. 

The Melt was perfect, the right amount burger spread over the bun with cheese on top and bottom and right amount of grilled onions. Cooked just rights with just enough pink. 

Yes it is a bar but so what. Not always keen about cash only but for some reason today was perfect ......maybe because the Hawks were winning. 

We&#39;re definitely going to be back."

Worth coming here even if from far to experience it since these type places are few and far between.   It&#39;s ok to bring kids even though it&#39;s a bar, I would suggest an age where they can sit still.  This is a small place inside and no where to move around with little ones.  So I&#39;d say 8 and up type place for kiddos.

I ordered a grilled cheese on Texas Toast ($4) with a cup of vegetable meatball soup ($3). The vegetable meatball soup was really flavorful! The grilled cheese was pretty big and extremely cheesy. It was really good! My friend got cheese flavored chips which were not homemade- they came in a packaged bag- she did not like them.

The menu says cash only and NO fries. No fries?!!! Those are the best part of a meal!

Service was ok.

If you&#39;re stopping by here, I&#39;d definitely recommend the grilled cheese and vegetable meatball soup! =)"

Not sure why I didn&#39;t make my way over here before. Nicks is a little hole in the wall place - if there were 25 people in here you&#39;d be bumping elbows. 

I sat at the bar and ordered a beer and the &#34;Little Nick&#34; which is an 8 ounce burger with cheddar cheese. I was able to see into the kitchen from my seat and I saw the most beautiful red burger patty go on to the grill that I&#39;ve ever seen - I could tell from 20 feet away that this is the kind of ground meat you get at your local butcher shop - not something that comes from Sysco that&#39;s been frozen for months.

The burger took a while to cook, however I did order it well done. Even with it being well done, it had plenty of flavor and even with it being the &#34;Little Nick&#34; was more than filling. I complimented my burger with some Andy Capp&#39;s Hot Fries - which I hadn&#39;t had in years - and a Polyanna beer. All in my check was slightly over $11. Not too 
bad!

All in all this place is definitely worth checking out if you&#39;re in the area. I will be back!

Protip: Bring cash - they don&#39;t take credit cards. There is an ATM on site though if you happen to forget."

Order 2 burgers to go while my family ate because I had to leave and they didn&#39;t even start the burgers until I asked her about them. I guess she was expecting us to watch my family eat while I waited for my burger to go. So I just left. Then the first time the bartender was too hungover to read an id.

We were there to watch some football on a saturday night and it was not too crowded, but there were some really loud talkers and people yelling as they played LCR (dice game)... I love LCR, but don&#39;t need to have someone screaming in my ear for 30 minutes straight about it.

But, their jukebox (frozen in time at 1974?) played all kinds of classic rock from the sixties up to 1974 was a nice diversion from the screaming going on. Maybe I&#39;m just getting too old? Anyhow, will come back and definitely try the burger that everyone raves about.

Had it not been for fellow Yelper, Robert R., I never would have found it- for it was here that we met one night to enjoy &#34;burgers as big as my head&#34; (his description) and icy cold beers.

His promise did not go unfulfilled.  For within 15 minutes of ordering- there arrived on our table, paper plates groaning with the weight of the burger it was being asked to hold.  The burger and bun overlapped the plate and the toppings were piled high.  And this giant mess of meat was perfectly cooked but it was almost a shame to cut this giant in half just to be able to eat it.

If you can&#39;t see any of the the thousand signs in this place that say, &#34;No Fries&#34;, know that they have, no fries.  But bags of chips are in abundance.

Service was friendly and this is obviously a place full of &#34;regulars&#34; as there was a lot of back slapping and hugging going on with everyone who walked in the door.  And this place has one of the nicest women&#39;s restrooms I&#39;ve ever seen in a bar of this type. 

But the funniest thing?  They close whenever they want.  Slow night?  Close it up.  Bartender needs to go?  Close it up.  I think on the night we were there they kicked us out around midnight.

After hearing it was on Chicago&#39;s Best AND they served ONE LB burgers we had no choice but to go. Portion size is very important to him as you can see. 
 
Nick&#39;s is located in downtown Lemont with plenty of street parking right out front. We visited this local hot spot on a Friday around 6pm. We were lucky to snag one of the last few open tables. The place was full of locals, a rowdy group of middle age women, 20 something guys taking shots of Patron at the bar, and other sipping on Coors Lights. 
 
I was not quite up for the burger and did not want to take leftovers home. I opted for the Chicago-style hot dog. My bf got the burger. The hot dog was thick and juicy (yes, you! get your mind out of the gutter! ). Stuffed with onions, relish and mustard. I stole multiple bites of the burger and it was awesome. No twist on it. Just a burger done exactly how all American burgers should be done.  
 
A unique pitch. They pride themselves in NOT having fries. Hmmmmmm Although I think most of the time I would rather just not have fries especially if they are mediocre. However, tonight instead of mediocre fries I had mediocre BBQ chips. Skip those.  

 
While I thought the burger would be bigger, closer to this (http://www.huddle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/fat-guy-eating-giant-hamburger.jpg)  at least it&#39;s less likely to make you hamburger shaped in the middle."

You probably have been to a place just like this many times before. An ordinary bar. Some tables and booths to eat and drink at. A limited menu of standard fare, hot dogs, hamburgers, etc...

We came here after a day of gallivanting in Lemont and what a perfect place to stop. The bar was practically empty, aside from a few regulars and everyone in the place was as nice as can be. The owners happened to be there at the time and came over to talk to us. 

There is a house dog who is very friendly, and they made sure to let us know that during the day friendly dogs are more than welcome. The prices are reasonable and there was one of those electronic jukeboxes on the wall to pick music. There were two small pool tables I believe and even though there were about 8 of us, no one gave us any nasty looks like some of those Lemont bars. 

Nick&#39;s isn&#39;t the fanciest bar, and it may look like a bit of a dive, but the people are great and it&#39;s a nice place to hang out. Kudos Nick&#39;s!"

We were about half an hour late. Kitchen closed at 11. So we sat and had a drink with the new owner. Very friendly place. We had a great time with the bar tender. And the Dr. Who&#39;s Tardis shaped cooler in the corner. And they have Shlitz in bottles. We were there with an Irish fellow that just got off the boat and we told him that was a premium beer and he had to try it. Well of course, everyone that walked into the place after that he talked them into drinking Shlitz. The owner loved him. Great little find. Will be back for the burgers."

On my way home from work today, I realized it&#39;s been waaay too long since I&#39;ve stopped at Nick&#39;s and so I checked my glovebox and sure enough, their menu was still there.  When ordering, I try to keep the toppings to a minumum so the flavor of my burger is not to be disguised.  That&#39;s how I tell how good the meat really is.  Anyway, one quick call and in no time, my burger was ready and waiting for me when I&#39;d arrived.  With 10 minutes still to go before I was pulling into my driveway, I buried my meal behind the seat so I wouldn&#39;t start nibbling at it on the way back.  Sometimes you just do what you gotta do.

If you&#39;re in Lemont and get a serious hankerin&#39; for the Angus, stop at Nick&#39;s for a burger and a beer...and tell &#39;em I sent ya.  They&#39;ll have no idea who you&#39;re talking about, but tell &#39;em anyway!"

I ordered the Italian wedding soup instead, it was unremarkable, and I had to eat it with a plastic spoon!  Nice atmosphere, so it&#39;s probably a better place to drink than to eat.

Nick&#39;s has a classic older dive-bar type feel, which I personally really enjoy with any bar as it makes you feel a little more welcome.  The beer selection is pretty decent and the burgers live up to the recommendation.  The burgers come with chips/pretzels, and not fries-- which normally would be a big deal for the starch n&#39; carb lover that I am but considering you will need a to-go box for your burger, it&#39;s not a problem.  Oh and just to confirm, the burgers are definitely worth the trip.

While there I happened into Nick&#39;s Tavern.  I was looking for lunch and a beer, and didn&#39;t think much of the place when I walked in, but one of the very friendly locals encouraged me to stay for a burger, and wow, what a burger!  Huge but not greasy, most people seem to cut them into fourths... just fantastic.

Sitting at the bar I quickly realized that this was a destination spot for the locals as lots of people seemed to know each other.  Everyone was very friendly and made me feel right at home.

It&#39;s definitely a bar, but clean and welcoming enough that several families were there with children.  I also wouldn&#39;t term it a dive bar as again, the place was clean and well managed.

Very small place with cap at about 50 people, and the place was packed! Every seat at the bar taken and the tables full too.  Some might call it a dive bar, but to me that brings up negative images which don&#39;t fit Nick&#39;s.  Bar was super clean and the decor was what I&#39;m going to term &#39;bar classic&#39;.  Not a ton of beers on tap, but they have a pretty standard bottle selection.  

Nick&#39;s is definitely known for it&#39;s Nickburgers, which are almost as large as the plate they come on.  Definitely get everything(lettuce, tomato, pickles, relish, ketchup, mustard, onions-grilled or raw) on your burger, especially the grilled onions.  They make their burgers fresh daily, and you can definitely taste that they&#39;re not pansy frozen pub burgers!  If you are starving, maybe you could finish the entire burger, but I was pleasantly full on half a burger, two beers and a bit of the bar mix.  

The owners, Don and Rob were working their butts off that night, but they still found time to chat with everyone and were very sincere in making sure everything was to our liking.  Great set of guys who make you want to make this your usual hang out spot, and I definitely would if I lived closer to Lemont!"

Nick&#39;s is a dive bar with 5-6 tables tops.  The bartender performs double-duty as your waiter/waitress and serves a nice cold old style along with your burger should you choose that route.  The reason there are so few reviews is because anyone who goes to Nick&#39;s would not know what Yelp is.  Go to Nick&#39;s.  Get a beer.  Get the burger.

First off, this place looks like a dive but why does it have to look like anything more than a hot dog joint, (gyros). They&#39;ve remodeled slightly over the years and what they are is a damn good hot dog, beef, gyros joint that also happens to serve other dishes which happen to be really good. People have to realize that most food here is fried or steamed. Thats ok, they aren&#39;t trying to be something else. Im reading reviews and someone complained about gyros being too salty. Gyros have salt, right?  If they dont , then theyre chicken gyros. 
Ive been coming here for years, Gina is usually here, ( I think thats her name) when shes not, others have done a decent job. Ive had hot dogs, gyros, beef sandwiches, they have a great pepper &amp; egg sandwich, burgers are good. What isnt good here. Service is always excellent, tops when Gina is here. She always gives extra pop or a lil something if she thinks your waiting too long. They have plenty of tables, it generally clean, though I usually do carryout. Fries are good, though a bit salty.

As always i allowed my fellow Yelpers to guide me and we ended up at Smiley&#39;s Gyros and beef on Rt 59 just south of Renwick rd. Very solid reviews!

My wife was a little worried about the choice as it looks pretty rough from the outside. I assured her that I have never been steered wrong by Yelp. (Foreshadowing ;)

We entered Smileys and it was empty 12:30 PM on a Monday.  First thing I notice is that 1/2 of the ceiling lights are out making the store very dark in the back.  Next thing I realize is there is a smell that I can&#39;t categorize as food.... More chemical or ammonia smelling.  Like they just cleaned up after a mob hit or something.

But even though every alarm bell and red flag are blaring in my head, I push on because I can&#39;t let my wife see that I am questioning almighty Yelp with every step I take towards the counter to order.

We order the Gyros platter and some Jalpeno poppers with a side of cheese for the fries.  The food came out quickly and we divvied up the gyro meat and two pitas.  Really very tasty and the portion of meat was huge! B+

Jalpeno poppers were terrible. D-

I really did enjoy the Gyro platter but it couldn&#39;t carry the rest of the negatives.  I can&#39;t overlook how terrible the place looked and smelled.  If they don&#39;t care enough about how the front of house looks and smells I can&#39;t imagine they have any reason to clean the back of the house.

Location is easy to get in and out of, with the light on Renwick and Rt30. Its in the same strip mall, as Dairy Queen.

I ordered the Greek chicken salad and it was insane.  It was probably a good thing I went alone because I would have talked the ears off anyone with me about how fantastic this salad was.  I attempted to make eye contact with other lunch-goers to force a food raving conversation to no avail.  Everyone was face first in their meals.  Half-dollar chunks of feta cheese, the perfect ratio of onion to be non-overbearing, crisp lettuce, Greek olives, pepperoncini, dressing and ripe tomatoes with a generous portion of freshly grilled chicken strips on top.  Sounds simple, but it was UH-May-Zing.  The lady that runs this joint came over and gave me a couple hot pitas to go with it and that put me over the edge.  I literally almost collapsed in the booth from flavor overload and pure unadulterated food induced bliss.  I will be getting this combination every time I go back until I hear something on the menu has the upper hand.  Hands down the greatest salad in existence."

They do get verrrrry busy on the weekends so the earlier you get there the better. Even though they get very busy you don&#39;t feel cramped at the tables (they can actually accommodate large groups and not squeeze people in). 

The pricing is fair considering they give you quite a bit of food. The omlettes are large and well worth $9.99. They come with pancakes or toast and jimmys potatoes (which I love!) or hash browns. The kids menu has a lot of options for kids. This restaurant is very child friendly.

With his knowledge of the area, we decided to head to Juicy-O for our meal.

Fortunately, I had a good idea of what to expect because I had been to the Downers Grove location a few years back.

They offer the same exact menu, but I had a good idea going into my meal that I was going to get my standard: omelette with fruit instead of potatoes, and a side of pancakes. I just had to decide what exactly I wanted.

We were seated after a very brief wait (we arrived around noon; if we would have arrived 15 minutes later, we would have had no wait). My brother ordered his coffee and I stuck with water. I decided on the grilled vegetable omelette, which featured green and red peppers, zucchini, mushroom, and onion. Avocado is usually featured in my orders, but since they weren&#39;t part of the meal, I went with eggs instead of my usual egg beaters. For my pancakes, I remembered that I really liked their stone ground whole wheat cakes, and I decided on adding blueberries for no extra charge. My brother ordered the grilled vegetable frittata, which was the same ingredients as my omelette but was cooked with Italian seasonings and topped with asiago cheese. He went with regular whole wheat cakes and cottage cheese.

Our food was out in about 7 minutes... extremely fast! Our server was just okay; we asked for sugar free syrup and extra napkins, and we only had the syrup delivered after a bit of a delay. She didn&#39;t really check on us after getting our food, but it wasn&#39;t a huge damper.

My co-worker said that Juicy-O uses coupons such as Groupon, but even without one I will be going back. I love breakfast/lunch style places like these. They have something for everyone! Prices weren&#39;t terrible either; $24.81 for 2 people (2 and change for coffee). Pancakes were my favorite part of the meal but that&#39;s not to say the rest was bad."

I never had such tasty breakfast potatoes. The free donuts served before the food  were yummy. I am confused why there were only a handful of people here on a Friday morning. Yes, the prices are a bit high but not much different than other similar places that close right after lunch. I imagine as good as this place is they must fill up on the weekends. I&#39;m from Chicago so not likely I&#39;ll be back but if I do find myself back in the area at breakfast time I&#39;ll be sure to stop in."

Met at the entrance by no one. Sat down and started to notice things. Dirty everything. The ketchup bottle was caked with old ketchup. The booths had funk and crumbs in every crevice. Everything felt unkept. The silverware made me want to bring my own. The food came and I had ordered some biscuits and gravy. The biscuits were burnt and the gravy had the flavor of just flour. My wife has an omelette and &#34;fresh&#34; fruit. The omelette was dry and the fruit was days old. We left what was left of our food and got out of there. I suggest that you skip this place until they find themselves again

They brought TWO samples of donuts this time (one for me and one for my twin brother). We had Eva (our waitress, who was pretty good) take them away since I&#39;d eat the whole thing!

Check my previous review for facts about this place.

Ordered a frittata and omelette (grilled vegetable varieties). Came in about 10 minutes which was AWESOME! Whole wheat pancakes, blueberry whole wheat pancakes, cottage cheese, and fruit were subs (FO&#39; FREE).

Only reason not for five star? No extra napkins...:-)...after being asked a few times. 

I&#39;ve been here twice. I got an omelette the second time and it was great! The service here is the reason I take off one star. Sometimes you hear from your waitress and other times you wait! I was smart enough to ask her to leave the carafe of coffee!"

Front counter, many people, I don&#39;t know whom is the hostess, someone finally does get a table, it&#39;s once again less than clean, bench has some left overs, OK we move on. Waitress comes over, fairly polite, young, definitely not seasoned but personable. We get the food, it&#39;s only OK, not at all what I&#39;ve hoped for, cottage cheese and blintzes in general have some weird aftertaste, almost bitter. I decide to use the bathroom before we leave, once again it&#39;s not clean and it&#39;s not even 9 am on Sunday, there is dust on the dispensers, etc...

The breakfast foods that I&#39;ve tried have always, been good. The skillets are yummy, good portions and the food comes out quick. On the weekends there is a wait for a table and it can get busy but its worth it. The little donuts that you get when seated are good. My only complaint is the service. A few times the server hasnt been too pleaseant. Youre serving people, a warm sincere smile goes a long way. Some of the waitresses are not friendly at all.

The waitress seemed like she was giving great customer service, but hearing her get screamed at made me question the management here. She was forced to go back to the guest and present a 2 dollar upcharge for a sliced tomato.

As for the food, I&#39;ve always been pleasantly surprised. The portions are HUGE! I usually get a skillet or omelette with a side of pancakes and the pancakes are the size of a large dinner plate. There&#39;s no way you&#39;ll leave this place hungry.

They do not welcome individual carry out orders.  As a mattet of fact, the call taker frequently seemed super annoyed by having to place an order.   We have taken our business elsewhere. 

I went to lunch at this location only because I had a Groupon.   The baked oatmeal was a surprisingly delicious offering and the soft, cinnamon sweet, warm donuts scrumptious.

She was very pleasant, always smiling, and kept her cool with all the diffrrent requests we had. She definitely deserved five stars... The only reason I gave four stars was that some of the food was cold by the time we received it although that was not server&#39;s fault. Management should have provided more waitstaff for party that large and yes, we had made reservations far in advance.  The panini sandwiches were excellent and were really a bargain as you receive bowl of soup and french fries with the sandwich.

We were seated at a table that looked like it was not cleaned. It had a big pile of salt spilled under the table. The waitress walked past us for a good 10 minutes without bringing water, coffee, etc. The best part was the fact that several servers were standing around talking to each other completely oblivious to their customers.

Okay maybe the food will make up for it... nope. The donuts were fantastic. Hot, fresh and melt in your mouth good. Unfortunately the rest of the menu wasn&#39;t the same. I ordered the Breakfast Burrito. It tasted like they cooked it in the microwave. The outside was hot but the inside was cold. The cheese wasn&#39;t even melted inside, the vegetables were crunchy and no salsa came with the burrito. It was a big cold mess. I couldn&#39;t even get the waitress to take it back because I didn&#39;t see her again until 20 minutes later. I hardly ever say this but I actually got sick an hour after eating here. 

Checking out was even a nightmare. One cashier and the line was stretching out into the dining room. Another 15 minutes wasted.

Yes, out on the floor for customers to hear. I heard them laugh and joke about how the parent must just shove it her mouth to shut her up and not care. So wrong. My niece is 3... Not 10. I don&#39;t judge my brother&#39;s family and I sure as hell don&#39;t expect some waitress to do the same. When I addressed the manager (as the two were still ridiculing her just 2 feet from him), he acted like he couldn&#39;t hear even though he was closer than I and I heard it. He said &#34;oh ok&#34;. I asked what that meant and he shrugged his shoulders. That&#39;s it. He took my credut card and gave me a receipt to sign.

My server inquired on my meal and I explained it was cold. She asked if I¬†wanted something else or more donuts. I declined and asked for my check. When she returned another lady was with her. I assume she was a manager however, she did not introduce herself. She asked if my food was cold and I confirmed it was. She then stated she could not understand how it could have been cold. I did not understand the reason for her question. So, I¬†asked¬†if she was questioning my complaint. She became quite¬†nasty with me and claimed she only asked the question to avoid it from happening to anyone else. She and the server walked away.

I was dissatisfied with the manager on duty.¬†She lacks the ability to resolve customer complaints in a professional manner.¬†It seemed more appropriate¬†to question the kitchen staff and server¬†- not¬†the customer.

Before I decided what I was actually going to order, it was between the avocado, bacon and tomato omelette and the chicken and waffles.

When we first got there, no one was waiting for a table. Although they took our name since they didn&#39;t have a table ready for more than 4 people. Fine, we waited, and waited, and waited. There were, let&#39;s just say, &#34;too many&#34; people seated before us that had less than 5 people with little to no wait. Total wait time was 35 minutes, which would have been ok if they had told us this. Be warned: If you have a table needing to seat more than 4, your wait could be extra long. In their main dining room, I counted only 3 tables that opened to hold more than 4 people. They gave us extra mini doughnuts to compensate for our wait. But those are free anyway, right?

Food: I liked the mini doughnuts. Tasted good, and they were green since it was St. Patty&#39;s Day weekend. The menu looked pretty extensive which makes me want to try a different dish if I happen to go again. However, I ordered the Corned Beef Hash with Eggs breakfast. DO NOT ORDER THIS! The taste was so overpowering of onions, that I didn&#39;t eat my meal. I am not a picky eater but this was horrible.  I told the waitress and she offered to bring me a different meal to go instead, but I was not feeling this place at this point so I opted out.

Overall: I think the set up of this place is kind of weird. There is a side room that if there is a large amount of waiting people, the food runners have to carry your food in between the huge crowd of people before it reaches your table. I think I would try this place again to see how it fares next time around. I wouldn&#39;t go without a coupon though since those seem to be in mailers and fliers everywhere."

The french toast did not have much egg content.  The breakfast combos wife and I had were each $7.95, so reasonably priced.  The complimentary donut holes were nice and distinctive for a breakfast place, and the pancakes are pretty large.  Their main dining room was pretty vibrant, but they also have a  small upstairs section where we sat.  Servers and hostesses are friendly despite the busyness.

Can&#39;t say it was the most impressive breakfast I&#39;ve had in town. 

For one thing, we were there well before the week-end morning rush, but it seemed like the wait staff couldn&#39;t be bothered with us. 

The food did come out quickly; in the meantime you can read all the cheezy sayings all over the walls. You do get a lot of food for the price, but don&#39;t be too picky about the quality (pancakes are the size of the plate, though they are on the tough side rather than fluffy; also, two of my pieces of bacon hadn&#39;t been separated so neither was really cooked on one side.)

Basically what I am saying is, with all the breakfast places in town (my favorite probably being Pancake Cafe on Rickert), you can do better."

The service was the source of especial frustration. Frankly, it sucks.  You have to beg for a coffee refill and everything moves at the pace of shifting tectonic plates.  It is woefully understaffed.

The food was fair at best, with the complimentary mini donuts being the only thing that was above average.  The &#34;screwy louie&#34; skillet was a nondescript pile of beige food with little flavor (and probably 300 calories per forkful). My wife&#39;s order was screwed up, and the kid&#39;s mac and cheese is straight out of a Kraft box.  Better (by far) options include Eggs, Inc and Butterfield&#39;s."

The service here was on par with other breakfast places in the area. The menu has a good size selection of items to choose from. Prices here are high though compared to other places. When you sit down they give you a few complementary mini donuts. Those are quite good and probably my favorite part about dinning here. For breakfast I had the chocolate chip waffle. The Waffle was good but pricy for what you got. It was nothing special and you can get the same thing much cheaper at other places in the area. Over all I found the food here to be good but expensive for what you get.

The food can be inconsistent.  Today I have the bananas foster waffle, and it was delicious; the last time I ordered one, it was messed up.  I&#39;ve never had a bad server at this location--very attentive and helpful.  On the other hand, the service at the hostess stand varies widely, depending on who you&#39;re dealing with.  The restaurant needs to find some way of separating the guests waiting to be seated from those going to the register to pay.  That would help both customers and hostess staff."

Congratulations to Juicy O for having the worst service in Naperville. We arrived on a Sunday morning with a somewhat large party of 10 so we knew there might be a wait going into it, we are told 15-20 minutes, not so bad...an hour later still no table. I kept watching them seat parties of 4-5 people over and over. Do you think they would have thought about pushing two of those 4-tops together to seat us????? Worst part is a party of 11 came in after us and got seated before us, when I called out the manager she said they phoned ahead....too bad for the manager that I was friends with one of the people in that party of 11 and they had just phoned ahead about 10 minutes prior to arriving. We waited about 65 minutes to get seated and then once we got seated it was another 15 minutes before we had our drink orders taken. The manager is an evil scornful women who should definately not be in the service industry becuase it is clear she does not know how to do her job and does not do well in social settings and is in WAY over her head. 

Food quality was decent but could NEVER make up for the poor service. Coffee refills, what are those? They finally brought out a coffee carafe for refills after everyone was done eating.

In looking at all the other reviews on here it appears service, or should I say lack their of is their downfall."

Our experience at the Willowbrook location was much better, but still not worthy of a 4 or 5 star. Really I&#39;m just giving it a 2 and I will probably go back one of these days without saying that my last experience was horrible. I don&#39;t know what it was. Our good friends raved about how this was hands down the best breakfast place they&#39;ve ever been to. And these are our foody friends. We know that they don&#39;t have bad taste. So we try to see what it&#39;s all about. Here I go with another breakfast review. I feel like they are all sounding the same, but I try place&#39;s skillets, their southern food, and every once in a while, their Mexican breakfast foods. 

First of all, their shtick is the fresh donuts on every table when you sit down. To me, they were plain cinnamon/sugar donuts that you kind of feel obligated to eat since they are right there and in the end you just don&#39;t know why you ate them. They aren&#39;t really good and most of the time, they are already cold. The service is definitely not great. It&#39;s like they really tried to find the rudest and most inattentive and uncaring servers they could find like it was a job requirement. Not one server we have had even remotely cared about receiving a tip. The look and feel is weird. It&#39;s too new and reminds me of an old lady who just discovered the internet and posted up old lady humor jokes and pictures she found all over the walls.

The coffee is boring and the food is just plain ordinary. Again, I could drive down the road and have literally the same thing at another breakfast place. Another one of their icons are Jimmy&#39;s potatoes. Again, meh. This was our friend&#39;s sticking point and their favorite item. They&#39;re like sliced potato wedge pieces with a little salt, pepper, a touch of cayenne, and other spices thrown in with a ton of onions. Onion flavor really doesn&#39;t agree with me so maybe that&#39;s it, but I see no redeeming quality in these potatoes and the rest of the experience. As for my other breakfast food, again, nothing special. Ordinary, thrown together generic breakfast that just doesn&#39;t taste like your family sit down breakfast, your hole in the wall breakfast nook, or your country farmers market. It&#39;s all a plate of bagged boring.

I really hope my friends don&#39;t hate me for saying all that about their favorite place. Sorry guys."

Wasn&#39;t really impressed with the service or food... Both were mediocre. The people that were sitting behind us had a hair in their food and mold on their fruit. They were discreet about it when telling the waitress, but it was audible to us. Kind of gross. MANAGER DID NOT EVEN COME OVER TO TALK TO THEM!  UNACCEPTABLE!
The restaurant itself looked very clean, which I appreciated immensely. The bathrooms, however, were a different story. Would not return."

Always looking for the kind of doughnut that brings you to nirvana. Juicy O&#39;s has made me a fiend! But not just for their doughnuts, which they bring to your table upon seating as a free &#34;bread basket&#34; (but fresh and hot and 10 Xs better) but they ammmmazzzzzing Nutella crepes. I think I hear angels singing. I really don&#39;t go here for breakfast, I go here for a self induced sugar coma. Anyway, the point? Their doughnuts are light and coated in cinnamon sugar. The Nutella crepes are HUGE. We always ask for strawberries with it, instead of bananas. Do it with no extra charge. Their omelets are awesome and HUGE. One woman who is behind the front desk isn&#39;t the best at customer service but whatever at least the waiters have always been wonderful. 
Once we went on busy Columbus Day. The service was pretty bad. I guess because they were busy? It seriously sucked though. But our waiter was a nice guy. We got the crepes (obvi) and there was like no Nutella on it. Well, I&#39;m not paying $11 for crepes without leaving with sugar coma, you know?? So he was very nice about it and brought us brand new crepes with probably a whole jar of Nutella and they were epically delicious.

If I could rate a minus I would.  Arrived to see chaos at the reception desk, the person was stressed out of their mind, trying to greet new customers, be a cashier and serve donuts at the same time.  Waited 30 minutes for a table, finally were brought upstairs, waited 5 minutes for a server to come by, asked for coffee, took 20 minutes to bring one cup of coffee.  I had to remind the server to bring the coffee, she showed up with a cup and went to the next table and removed the coffee pot from their table and poured the coffee, very classy !!!

The server began complaining about the bussers because they were not helping her, sorry not my problem.  One of the reasons it take so long to get seated is because the tables are not cleared in a timely manner, there were two table of 4 next to us that had not been cleaned from the previous customers, the entire time we were seated almost an hour, no wonder they can&#39;t get people seated.

The food took 43 minutes to be served from the time the order was given.  The food was nothing to even bother writing about neither good nor bad.  Don&#39;t waste you time or money on this place, there are other very good breakfast places in Naperville and the surrounding areas. 

I certainly will never go back, this building must have a spell on it, there has been a restaurant failure one after another, at the rate they are going Jucy-O is the next to fall."

After being seated out of order (since someone forgot to write down our number and party size on the list), a bowl with three tiny donuts was plopped in front of our party of 2.  After we each ate one, we had to rock-paper-scissors to decide who would get the third (I was the lucky one).  The mini donuts were good, and even though there wasn&#39;t the proper food-to-human ratio for the donuts, I remained optimistic.

I had the frittata with fresh mozzarella, tomato, and pesto, which was topped with asiago. I think I would have like it, had it not been for the congealed mass of rubbery &#34;fresh&#34; mozzarella cheese which was localized to the center of the frittata.  Since I&#39;ve had a few hundred caprese salads in my adulthood, I am used to a melt-in-your-mouth soft and luscious QUALITY fresh mozzarella cheese, which this was not.  It was served with potatoes which were burned on one side and toast burned on one side.. When I say burned, I don&#39;t mean browned or caramelized, I mean charred to black.  In my own kitchen, the potatoes and toast would be considered garbage once they are burned, but apparently they have much lower standards at Juicy-O.  I would have loved to have cut off the burned parts of my potatoes, but instead of a butter knife, I was given some type of spreader (that looked like a knife) but had no cutting ability.  So instead, I awkwardly ate around the burned parts of the potatoes with my hands.  

The hubby had a standard plate of 2 eggs, toast and potatoes.  His eggs and toast were perfect, but his potatoes were even more charred than mine.

On top of that, my water glass stood empty for the last third of my meal and I had to ask for it to be filled.  Why do I have to ask?  Why isn&#39;t anyone checking?  And the line to check out was about eight parties long, so around 20 people were standing around waiting to check out clogging up the waiting area with only two people able to take money (one was credit cards only).

**** FOOD SAFETY ALERT #1 ***
This restaurant uses ketchup in bottles with caps.  Most of the restaurants I go to have changed over to squeeze bottles.  So what&#39;s the big difference?  When you have bottled ketchup, a frustrated diner may use a DIRTY KNIFE to get the ketchup unstuck.  This knife will have residue of whatever it was used for. Once the bacteria is in the bottle, it will replicate, especially since it is kept at room temperature.  This poses a risk of food poisoning.  Imagine someone cutting a medium rare hamburger and then using that knife in the bottle.  That scenario could result in a hospital stay for someone after the bacteria replicates for a day or two. 

**** FOOD SAFETY ALERT #2 ***
As I mentioned earlier, this place will serve charred items to customers.   I urge everyone to do an internet search on the words, &#34;charred food cancer&#34; and read the results.  There is evidence to suggest that once food is charred, there is a chemical change in the food making it carcinogen (which is quite hazardous to your health).

When I go out for breakfast, I want it to be a nice experience with quality food prepared the right way. This place failed on all accounts.  I mean it was a seriously awful, terrible experience. Perhaps the worst ever dining experience in my life."

The menu had a lot of unique items on it, including things like breakfast sliders. It was nice to see some different options available.

The fruit was not at all ripe, and the quiche tasted old and rubbery.  I was afraid of food poisoning so i just shoved it aside.  I felt that I had to say something to our server, and the management took it off my bill, which did make me happy.  I also ordered a cappuccino and I liked that, so my coffee drink became my lunch that day.

I will no longer dismiss your reviews, ESPECIALLY when you turn out in masses, and I&#39;ll even join you in this one.  I&#39;ve been there twice now and I&#39;ll never go back again, there are too many breakfast places around to spend my money here; truth is, I find it kind of hard to review breakfast places, it&#39;s really not all that hard to scramble eggs and toast bread, so service seems to be one of things that separates these types of restaurants from each other.  Both times I went the service was slow and inattentive, and both times the eggs and toast were cold; I went with a different set of people both times and no one really cared for their meals either time, and one person&#39;s pancakes cold and butter wouldn&#39;t even melt on them.  We were able to get fresh items, and even change another person&#39;s meal (she didn&#39;t care for hers), but it seemed like a lot of hassle to eat sub-par food.

However, I executed an offer on Double Take and my husband wasn&#39;t keen on the revisit, but the budget prevails!!  I figured if I steered clear of the pancakes,omelets and burrito&#39;s I&#39;d be fine.  My kids generally will eat anything, so I wasn&#39;t so worried there.   Again the front desk was scattered and we weren&#39;t quite sure who to approach to get on the list for the table as no one was directing us.  We finally get seated at a booth and immediately the waitress approached the table, this time luckily with the silverware in tow &amp; she was also quite friendly.  I was prepared this time with plastic utensils just in case. I casually told the waitress of our past struggles with the silverware and not getting it with humor.  I informed her  too that I blog on several food sites - so I was impressed that she took care of silverware right off the bat.  Her attitude it seemed to soften my earlier frustration.  She seemed to own the issues,agree, attesting it&#39;s a negative impact on her pay.  She apologized and told me that they are aware of this issue and she personally restructures her own service to spare her customers from a similar fate.  I also told the waitress that the hostess at the front desk wasn&#39;t friendly or approachable; as she asked why I reviewed.  She quickly agreed and confirmed it; she also added that the older blonde woman I spoke of was the general manager.   From that I was shocked/disappointed, because my dealings with her have been rude.  The manager isn&#39;t a people person, seems annoyed, unapproachable, curt and short, not one that should be on the front line greeting customers.  I was shocked that shortly after I was then approached by the manager at our table.  The waitress goes back and tells the manager and within minutes she approached our table.  She was the very person that we conveyed complaints too and was disregarded.  She approached our table in an attempt to what I thought to just introduce her-self as the manager and apologize for the service issues historically.  I very quickly realized her approach to me was more of frustration of what I had written and not as a means to make it right.  She made a point of noting my user name and stated that she recognized me from my picture.  She wasn&#39;t really interested in my past experiences or to apologize for that, she was simply in a hostile approach to gain understanding why I didn&#39;t approach her directly about my service issues.  She said  &#34;I want to give you a chance to speak to me face to face and not go on line to write about it in a review&#34;.  She definitely had an attitude, snotty, dismissive and hostile.  She caught me off guard, I said very little.   Need I remind her that I did attempt to address it with her at an earlier visit and she basically &#34;stared blankly at us and did/said nothing&#34;; What&#39;s the point?  I choose to share my experience so that others can learn before they invest time and money on a risky experience.  In Naperville you can go to a different restaurant 365 days a year and never hit the same one twice.  Service isn&#39;t negotiable.  Many folks will write off a place because of a bad experience, I write about it. As my husband was settling up the check and waiting in line he was behind another patron leaving the restaurant (This very manager that had just approached our table just 20 minutes prior, she seen him standing there waiting.) This patron was trying to sort out another issue with his experience there right then.  She then said &#34;sir we&#39;re going to have to let this go because they will write another false review written about me on yelp&#34;.  The other patron told her &#34;This is bad business; you have the authority to address this but choose not to.&#34;   My husband didn&#39;t hear the details of his complaint; but enough to know that he was unhappy, another witness that the manager failed to address another patron.  The manager than said to my husband &#34;There&#39;s a lot more to running a restaurant than people realize.&#34; This is just poor business and a quick way of going out of business.  This is a quick way to go out of business. A word of advice; never take your customers for granted, especially in Naperville.  This building has been a revolving door for failed restaurants from the time it opened.  The Groupon and Double Take will only get you so far.  If you can&#39;t maintain the clientele drawn in from these incentives your restaurant is doomed.  With all of the incentives, it worth it to address any and all complaints from Patrons swiftly &amp; fairly before they leave.  If not, the windfall of not doing it is catastrophic, because it&#39;s truly a small world.  Never accept less that you deserve when you&#39;re paying for it; especially when eating out.  You truly get what you pay for."

We went late so that they wouldn&#39;t be crowded, and we only waited a few minutes. Our server was excellent--when I was going to order two children&#39;s meals, she whispered to me that they were really big and suggested I just order one and have the boys split it. She was right! I don&#39;t know any child who could eat that huge of a pancake! 

Even though my older son kept asking for more crackers and donuts, the waitress never lost her smile. 
I had a fancy french toast, and when it was a little cold in the middle, she immediately fixed the problem and apologized. It ended up being very good. I asked for hot tea, and she brought me a huge pot so I didn&#39;t have to keep asking for more.  My sons devoured their pancake, which I snuck a bite of, and it was nice and fluffy. My older son actually hoarded his bacon and made me save a centimeter of it to take home for later.

I loved the donuts so much I bought some to take home for my husband. For a breakfast place, I thought the food was very tasty and the service kind, especially to a mom out alone with two kids who don&#39;t always, ahem, sit quietly."

I chose the latter.

The food is good and there are a ton of different options, mainly burgers and sandwiches. The French fries and onions rings are really good also. Great flavor and lots with each serving.

I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap and really enjoyed it, but wish it had a little bit more flavor. I like spicy foods, but it wasn&#39;t quite that. My friend ordered one of the burgers. He said it was delicious and cooked perfectly. It came with saut√©ed mushrooms and onions, cheese and some other ingredients all on a pretzel bun. 

The alcohol selection is impeccable though, full bar with lots of specials.

The prices are a little steep though. If I were to go back, I would stick with just drinks."

BURGERS + BEER + BABES + BANDS + BACKROOM PINBALL

Oh yes.

It&#39;s like Brixie&#39;s got pregnant with a kid from Kuma&#39;s Corner and their offspring received the best qualities from both parents, then during adolescence it got really into punk rock.

Following months of just enjoying their (admittedly awesome) pinball selection and giant 24oz PBR &#39;silos&#39;, I finally came here to eat a sustainable meal, and about damn time!  A lot of what&#39;s available on their menu is centered around metal/thrash/grindcore music, and more than one selection was catered towards people who love spicy stuff.

My folks and I came here for T.G.I.F. dinner and ordered appetizers not long after we got seated.  The chips + dip came out with salsa and guacamole; we all agreed that the chips were delicious and likely fried in-house.  We also got an order of the jalapeno poppers, which were gargantuan deep fried zeppelins, much larger than one would expect.  Those big f*ckers were fresh, stuffed with gooey cheese and really brought the heat.  Tasty, though.

We each ordered different burgers for our main courses.  My mom went with the &#39;Viking Skull&#39;, which came with a fried egg, bacon, onion and green peppers.  Dad enjoyed his &#39;Blaster&#39;, which featured blue cheese, garlic aioli, sun-dried tomatoes, bacon, red onions, and (get this)......olive tapenade.  They loved their choices immensely.

I, however, wasn&#39;t a fan of my selection.  I opted for the &#39;Hellbilly&#39;, their hottest burger.  It came loaded with pickled jalapenos, jalapeno-bacon sauce, spicy ketchup, lettuce, red onion, and crunchy tortilla strips.  For some reason, mine also came slathered in what looked like nacho cheese, which made for an exceedingly messy eat.  There were far too many clashing flavors going on, the burger quickly fell apart on me, and I honestly have no idea where the &#39;jalapeno-bacon sauce&#39; went, cuz that sh*t was nowhere to be found.

One of the great things about Brauerhouse is you get to choose from 5-6 bun options (i.e. brioche, kaiser roll, pretzel bun, toasted french roll, flour tortilla)  This makes for endless combinations, which encourages the customer to come back and find a burger matchup that works best!

All burgers are juicy  1/2-lb patties cooked to order and come with excellent homemade chips on the side [$11].  A reasonable value, if I must say.

Bread = 4.5
Circuses = 5+

The servers and atmosphere is what makes this place sparkle &amp; shine.  Every single bartender and server is a totally bodacious babe, many of whom have piercings (some possibly hidden, hey-o!), gauges, and tattoos a-plenty.  They&#39;re friendly, usually pretty timely/attentive, and are always, ALWAYS smokin&#39; hot.  Like what you&#39;d get if the gals from Hooters became roadies for The Misfits.

Besides being a solid restaurant and bar, Brauerhouse is a venue that also plays host to bands with colorful names like Harry Dick &amp; The Staples (?!?!)  At 8pm on a Friday, we saw people beginning to filter in -- after paying an undisclosed cover charge -- while they set up the stage for music.  I&#39;m told it can get exceedingly loud, so earplugs are available for purchase.

Their backroom (actually off on the left side when you walk in) includes half a dozen pinball machines, ranging from newer models like Stern&#39;s &#34;The Walking Dead&#34; &amp; &#34;Metallica&#34; to Williams classics like &#34;Dracula&#34; &amp; &#34;Monster Bash&#34;.  All games were 75¬¢ and in overall terrific condition.  They also have a pool table and digital jukebox in this area that sees very little foot traffic, thankfully.
____________

TL;DR

Come for the sexy, sizzlin&#39; service, stick around for the thrash punk (if that&#39;s your thing).  If it isn&#39;t, consider instead coming on a &#39;Cruise Night&#39; where muscle cars and motorcycles take over the parking lot.  If *that&#39;s* still too much biker for your blood, then a weeknight burger &amp; beer will do you well.

Certainly one of the better places in the Chicago suburbs to get your pinball fixation.  Y&#39;know, in case being serenaded by the local sounds of The Ringworm RiotShields isn&#39;t your cup of tea."

Our group was coming from Naperville, Aurora, and Roselle, so we decided Lombard right off the highway was a good spot to meet. We had six people in our group. My sister and her boyfriend got there first, so they reserved a table for all of us which happened to be up on the stage. It was pretty much the largest table in the restaurant, but hey - worked for us!

Our waitress greeted our table and let us know the drink special. $2 tall boy cans! What a throw back. Old Style? Yes please. On Thursdays they also have $5 bombs, $5 margaritas, and 49 cent wings.

After finishing our first beer we were asked if we&#39;d be ordering food. When we said yes, they said we&#39;d have to move to a different table if we wanted to stick around. Turns out the stage we were sitting on actually needed to host a band! Now I was all confused because I thought there was a cover on band nights and we didn&#39;t pay anything when we walked in. Maybe we arrived early enough? Either way, not complaining just confused.

Regardless, we were able to squeeze the 6 of us into a booth. The staff was helpful and even offered to get us a chair or two for the end of the booth. Plus, they gave us complimentary onion rings and a round of drinks for our trouble. You could say we were grateful and totally over the inconvenience!

The onion rings were pretty standard, but delicious none the less. Large, thick cut, crispy beer battered, greasy, and accompanied by delicious ranch dipping sauce. My husband and I decided to split the ultimate grilled cheese which includes jack cheddar and white american cheeses with bacon on sourdough bread. We ordered it without tomato because that&#39;s my hubbie&#39;s one bugaboo, but we added avocado for a small upcharge. They ended up being out of sourdough bread, so we went with rye. Their sandwiches come with homemade potato chips, but we opted for a side of their pistachio pesto fries instead. I mean come on, these babies are drizzled in a balsamic vinegar and finished with romano and parmesan cheese. The grilled cheese and fries were equally as delicious as the onion rings, but again, pretty (unhealthy) standard bar food if you ask me.

It should be noted that on Thursdays Brauerhouse is home to the famous Tire Swarm Car &amp; Bike Cruise aka Sons of Anarchy takeover. Now don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m a Sons of Anarchy nut and my husband loves motorcycles, but I was not prepared for this scenario. For starters, we looked super out of place. My husbands preppy polo stood out like a sore thumb against all the leather. It ended up being awesome people watching, but definitely contributed to the crowd.

Before we knew it the band was ready to rock. We really did not prepare for the noise level that was about to happen. Part of the reason we went out for drinks was to hang with my cousin before he moved out to the east coast. Needless to say we were basically screaming at each other across the table in order to hear. Not the best chatting scenario. I really did enjoy the music though. It was a rockabilly band with a lead singer that had a powerful voice like Adel. She was very entertaining.

To some up this experience I would say confusing. Between the cover or no cover situation, the seat change, the biker crew, and band... we didn&#39;t know what was going on! With that being said, I think Brauerhouse has a ton of potential for being a fun place to hang out at. They have all the essential ingredients - full bar, drink specials, delicious pub fare, and entertainment. Works for me. It wasn&#39;t working for this particular night however. If you&#39;re looking for a place to socialize with your group, Brauerhouse on a Thursday night is not it. If you want great music and cheap drinks... then head on over!

My tip to the team is to be a little more accommodating. Meaning, let folks know what&#39;s going on when they enter. It would be nice to know when and if you have to pay cover, if you need to seat yourself, and what&#39;s on the agenda for the night. I plan to pay Brauerhouse another visit at some point and will definitely report back!"

The food is delicious.  They have a gazillion specialty burger choices, plus pizza, salads, and appetizers.  There is also a kids menu.  My favorite salad is the Surfin Bird and my favorite sandwich is the Cheetah Chrome.  The hubs love the burgers with a fried egg on them and with tater tots.  I personally love the pesto fries.

This is good fun place to bring your family for a casual meal...on a weeknight before 8 pm....or on the weekend during the day.  If you bring the family closer the evening, your 5 year old may be confused by a burlesque show.  (He did not like their dancing or the fact that they were using newspapers as props.)

During the week, there are so awesome specials.  Once I went during the week and long islands were super cheap.  I had two and then took a nap in the car on the way home.  Luckily the hubs was driving....

Now I will say that my style is more trendy-working-mom than heavy metal-punk.  Sometimes I feel VERY vanilla here....but it doesn&#39;t matter.  The servers are usually smoking hot chicks with tattoo sleeves and nose rings.  But they are the nicest, friendliest, most helpful servers EVER!"

My favorite item on their menu is the Zombie burger. This is their trademark burger and I have ordered it many times. My former co-worker and friend recommended that I try the Lux Interior burger this time so I did. It was good of course but it was overcooked and dry. The description on the menu mentioned a bacon patty as well. There was some crushed bacon on there but not really a patty. I guess when you are hooked on Zombie burgers you should not be experimenting with the others. HA!

I also had the potato puffs with it and they were average. The appetizers on the menu are all good and the jalapeno poppers are the size of a large rat! Yum!

I had Rosemary&#39;s Baby burger, and it was packed full of flavor. It wasn&#39;t cooked medium rare like I asked for (it was more well done), but it still tasted really good.

As a music venue, I&#39;m not so sure. It was $10 to get it (we were already in and if we wanted to stay we had to pay $10 each). The band was really loud, and honestly not worth $10 a person. Maybe $5, but $10 seems like a bit much. It&#39;s not a huge place, but it never got very packed either.

Brauerhouse.

Honestly, Brauerhouse surprised me. I never expected such an ecclectic bar in a little strip mall slightly hidden from the road in this area of the &#39;burbs. Red and black decor, funky chandeliers hanging from the ceiling, tattooed waitresses, endless posters and flyers advertising upcoming events, and a crazy awesome menu with burgers, pizza, and lot of beer. And somehow, they manage to squeeze plenty of people here on a regular basis for shows, [risque] bingo nights, and other such events.

Actually, the first time I came here was a weekend night to see a friend play in his band. At this point, it had been a few years since I was at that time in my life where I went to see local bands every weekend -- so my going-out self was a bit rusty and overwhelmed. We were up all night, watching different bands, cheering along, and eating as much pizza as we could -- crammed into a booth while watching people dance (if you could call it dancing) on the floor space. Tables had been moved to allow space for people to gather (ahhh, so that&#39;s how they make room for everyone).

The next time I came here was on a bright afternoon with a group of fantastic Yelpers after a couple hours at the shooting range. We were accommodated at a big table in the corner, regardless of the charity event that was going on at the time. Our server was attentive, the food was satisfactory, and the beer was good.

Great menu and beer selection! I think it&#39;d be better if you didn&#39;t seat yourself.. Ran into a little snafu with that when a couple tried to snag the table a server was clearing for us. She handled it well but both parties felt a little awkward. Actually the other couple looked kind of pissed. 

We tried the Tachos, which were delicious and the pizza that had all the Reuben toppings. Sounded great in theory but I think we just prefer it on a sandwich or burger, which is no knock on them.. And they offer those things! 

We&#39;ll be back to try more!"

Foodies don&#39;t expect good food from a bar, and Brauerhouse surprises. First, take a look at the menu, those wraps and pizzas, even burgers. You will start to salivate because there are unique items, or even classics with their twist. Their west coast chicken pizza is a must try. While chains like CPK are investing so much into their pizza, you can find a very well balanced pie right here. The crust and bbq sauce with the citrus flavors really make this pizza a stand out on the menu, and I will add locally. We went with a safe bet on the buffalo chicken wrap as well. Still, not a bad wrap! check out my pic of this guy, good tortilla, seasoned fries, flavorful fillings and really fresh veggies. I need to get back in here to try more stuff! 

Other than the food, the ambiance is pretty out there, like a biker bar with a grungy concert vibe. The place might look like it should be a lot dirtier but its clean. the big window to look into the kitchen will also give you some comfort knowing the back of the house is very clean. If you dont mind rocking out to some AC DC or lettin your Led out with some really good food. Get over here. 
Bonus : they have this arcade/pool table game room also, and outdoor seating too!"

&#34;Um, okay, thanks, bye!&#34; I turned on my heel and headed toward the door.  I wanted a burger, not some shitty band.

&#34;Wait! Wait! Are you guys just looking to eat dinner?&#34; he asked.

&#34;Yes,&#34; I said.

&#34;Okay, go ahead.  The band hasn&#39;t started yet.  If you decide to stay, we&#39;ll get ya later,&#34; he said.  How kind!  We went and seated ourselves at a table.  A waitress came by and gave us some water.

The service was prompt, the keg was empty for what I had ordered... So she was quite accommodating in bringing other samples to the table. We ended up trying a beer neither one of us would have had tried without her suggestion.

Of course, I got a burger because their burgers are truly phenomenal. Normally, I opt for the zombie burger but instead I tried something new. All their meals have fairly unique names, so I honestly can&#39;t remember what it&#39;s called.... But it was great. 

My friend got a BBQ chicken sandwich and he said it was amazing.

If you like whiskey, make sure you try the whiskey pickle: one shot of pickle juice and one shot of whiskey.  Good stuff!

The food sounds delicious but meh. Thrice I had a burger and each time, they kind of lacked flavor. The burger names are fun though!  The fried pickles were pretty good and I love that they have tater tots.....cause I&#39;m a child. 

It&#39;s located in a strip mall on the Northwest corner of 53 and North Avenue. Yup, call me Google Maps.

Its kind of confusing when you come in because there isn&#39;t exactly a host or hostess. Basically, if there&#39;s a free table, you just grab it so it can be difficult at times. The environment is interesting. It&#39;s small and always packed here for lunch, so I&#39;d be curious to see how it is for a show at night. I don&#39;t think it&#39;d be a very comfortable place to watch a band, but I haven&#39;t been so I can&#39;t say much! This visit I went with my boss. Our server was Jianna and she was very friendly and helpful! I got the grilled cheese with avocado. It was really yummy! I wasn&#39;t a fan of their house made chips though. We also got the fried pickle spears as an appetizer. They were good, but I could only have one and a half since the sandwich was so filling and the pickles were pretty intense. The breading was really thick on them, which isn&#39;t a bad thing but I would have definitely had a tummy ache if I had eaten more."

Typically, the music hotspots are reserved for the Chicago neighborhoods, but Brauerhouse gives those places a run for its money. And the fact that it has amazing food and great beers makes it a definite go-to for the burbs.

I came here for the first time with a group of Yelpers. We had a big group, but it was a Sunday afternoon so there was room for all of us. Other times I&#39;ve been here have been for shows by local bands. This place is kind of a mix of bikers and rockers, but don&#39;t let that intimidate you. Anyone can have a good time here. 

The food is phenomenal. I&#39;ve had the ultimate grilled cheese and the zombie burger, both with tots. They knocked it out of the park. It&#39;s hard to find good tots but they&#39;ve got em. I&#39;ve also seen someone get the tater nachos. It&#39;s listed as a starter but beware: that thing is a friggin meal. It is huge and looks absolutely glorious. I&#39;ve heard the pizza is good here as well. As for drinks, they&#39;ve got tons of them. Plenty of craft beer options both on tap and bottle. Dale&#39;s Pale Ale, Three Floyds, Rouge, Ska, the list goes on. 

If you&#39;re going for a show, try to get there a little early, as seating goes quickly and there&#39;s not a lot of good options for standing. One gripe I do have is that the shows don&#39;t typically start on time. One time, the band was over an hour over the posted time. Not really a problem if its a weekend and you&#39;re planning to be there for a while, but it sucks if you&#39;re going to a show during the week and you have work the next day. Can&#39;t wait forever. That being said, I still highly recommend you try this out. The decor is pretty kooky (random signs, chandeliers, posters, dark walls, etc) but that just means there&#39;s no shortage of personality!"

Not sure why, the most complicated thing we ordered was a chicken sandwich.  I ordered a salad that had jalapenos on it, and the jalapeno slices were so big, they were inedible.  The chicken pieces were extremely tiny.  It also took our server forever to get us our checks.  Might be a good place to go and listen to bands, but eat beforehand"

I recommend going on Sunday for half off Bloody Mary&#39;s.  They have daily specials throughout the week but something about greasy filling food with a Bloody Mary decorated with all the accouterments - is just so tasty!

My husband works around the corner, so I found an occasion to grab a burger with him recently. I&#39;m pretty glad that I did. 

Brauerhouse has bands regularly and things like midget wrestling. While we couldn&#39;t figure out where they put all those throngs of people, we imagine that people keep coming back for those tasty burgers. 

I really like that their kitchen has a wide open window, so you can see what&#39;s going on back there. This is something that makes me happy inside...they&#39;ve got nothing to hide. 

We ordered a couple sodas to start. I ordered a burger that wasn&#39;t exactly on their menu, but they made it happen. A medium cooked beef patty on a pretzel roll with bacon and an onion ring. Oh and their jalape√±o bacon sauce on the side. It&#39;s important to note that I didn&#39;t eat the jalape√±o bacon sauce because it was a cheese sauce and I had no idea of that fact from the menu. Our server did mention that the menu will be updated soon. It&#39;s kinda hard to read. I went with tater tots on the side for a slight upcharge. The husband went with a burger that he&#39;s had before - the zombie, I think - and their homemade potato chips. The burger was a mess all over the plate, but the flavors were good. 

We had good service and full drinks. I would definitely head back for a quick lunch or early dinner."

Unique setup, pinball, good beer selection and great food.  Get the Tater Tachos, you won&#39;t be disappointed. The Tachos alone are worth a visit. 

I give them 4 out 5 stars mainly because Brauerhouse has the same issue that lots of good beer places have. They have a great selection of beer but the Servers are almost clueless when it comes to what they have.  On top of that two times that I&#39;ve been there I tried ordering Lagunitas Little Sumpin Sumpin and both times &#34;they just ran out&#34;  One time was on a busy friday night..the other time was on a slow saturday afternoon.  If a place doesn&#39;t have a beer they should take it off their draft board.

I went to their old location, and thought it was a cool bar.  But in a store front, it&#39;s a lot brighter and now I see it as more a restaurant than bar.  Which is cool by me, cause I don&#39;t really drink.

I had the zombie burger and it was hilarious and awesome.  Especially the day before Halloween.  Although it was by far the messiest burger that I ever had.  It&#39;s the kind of burger that once you pick it up you can&#39;t put it down because it will get all over the place.  That is not a bad thing at all to me.

The tater tots were excellent, and was a great touch.

I tried my friends Ultimate Grilled Cheese, and it was great too.

Love the theme here.  And, you might expect by seeing things around the store that the bathroom wouldn&#39;t be a highlight... it was actually really nice.

That&#39;s about as direct and accurate as I can get. 
Juicy, super flavorful and too big to finish (For me) and busting with goodies like olives bacon and a pretzel bun and I was hooked. 
Paired with home made chips and an iced tea and all I really required afterward was a couch to snooze the afternoon away. 
Also tried the chips and salsa, zesty with the perfect amount of heat. It could only get better if they had a stage for punk rock and metal bands to shred- Oh wait, they do!

I would have to say it probably has 121564654645 calories and you can probably starve for the rest of the day or work out hardcore at the gym to burn the 165454564 calories that you ate...but it was delicious...worth trying.. but not something you would want to eat on a daily basis....YUM.....and the portion is HUGE so it can be a meal alone (I would recommend sharing it with people.. if you&#39;re going to get a burger too--you will be stuffed and have food coma for the rest of the day)
**doesn&#39;t taste good if it&#39;s cold though...eat it while it&#39;s warm!

Alpha ($9.95) -comes with homemade B-House potato chips and consists of jalapeno-bacon sauce, homemade whiskey BBQ sauce, onion ring, bacon, mushrooms, caramelized onion, hard boiled egg garnish
--this burger is loaded with ingredients so it is a bit messy to eat...
--I&#39;m not sure if it was the burger alone or the sauce, but it was REALLY SALTY!!!
--hard boiled egg had a vinegary taste to it... interesting.. but after eating the salty burger, I would have rather had a fried egg or regular hard boiled egg with the burger
--no crunch to the onion ring.. probably due to the caramelized onions and sauces..
--the chips are good because they are homemade, but doesn&#39;t taste good for leftovers..
--wouldn&#39;t recommend this burger.. :( 

Costs: a little bit on the higher end for a burger...I would rather go to Red Robin...

Customer Service: not too great..the waitresses are nice, but the wait time is too long...

I&#39;ve tried burgers here in the past that weren&#39;t as salty or tasted good.. like the Rosemary&#39;s Baby...but it&#39;s been too long for me to explain the flavors...

I&#39;ll have to come here again to try the different burgers again.."

The waitress came  over within 5 minutes which wasn&#39;t a problem, she got me the wrong drink and immediately noticed and went to fix it. 10 minutes later, no I am not exaggerating, she came back and then took our order. It wasn&#39;t a particularly busy time when we got there. The food was fine and as good as any other restaurant. We got checked on one time and waited a good 45-60 minutes for our food. We spent almost 2 hours here when we were planning on an hour in and out. We waited around for about 20-30 minutes for a check which never came. We hunted down our waitress just so we could pay and leave. Like I said, the food was fine, but our service was disappointing."

Food was excellent both times, and I&#39;ve always enjoyed everything I&#39;ve ordered from Brauerhouse. I have yet to find a better burger!  But I actually started this yelp account to rate the servers: Faith on Saturday, and Colleen on Sunday.

Faith was friendly, absolutely attentive, made great bar recommendations, and made us feel completely at home despite tables being removed for the show set-up; never felt remotely rushed.

Returned again on Sunday with my family and had Colleen as a server.  While there, my 6 year old nephew began to feel sick.  Colleen&#39;s care and concern for my nephew was absolutely stellar.  She checked on him often, brought him both hot and cold water to soothe his stomach, and even offered him 7UP.

Another server, whose name I did not get, even brought my nephew some tea/honey/lemon.

I cannot say enough about the staff&#39;s performance this weekend.  Will happily be returning!"

Nice little Sunday. 

It&#39;s a little slice of suburban punk rock in a strip mall off North Ave between 355 and Rohlwing Rd. I was a big fan of the old Brauerhaus before it burned down and I&#39;d been wanting to try it&#39;s reincarnation since it opened a few years back. The location is definitely kind of a strange one, not where you&#39;d expect a bar of this caliber to be, but it&#39;s a place that&#39;s absolutely worth checking out. 

They had an interesting looking cocktail list that I had a hard time saying no to, but I decided to stick with beer as their had some really great options... unfortunately they were out of quite a few things that their chalkboard menu said they were carrying, so I felt bad for my friends who had to call on a second choice, but they had my Modus Hoperandi so I was happy. 

I got the fried pickles because duh. They were perfect... and came with a side of ranch to dip. It&#39;s probably meant to be an appetizer but it was more than enough food for a meal for me. My dining partners all got burgers... smothered in cheese, bacon, and jalapenos and all the things that make me miss real meat burgers, including pretzel buns. 

I loved our server. She was tiny but mighty and super cute + sweet. It was my first time at this location so I wasn&#39;t sure about the drill on seating and such but she set us up at a big table and went through the drink list stat... which is exactly what I needed. 

And beyond their regularly scheduled theme and band nights, they have free pizza during all bears games. I don&#39;t really give a sh*t about sports, but I love free pizza, so I&#39;ll totally be back for another go at Brauer this season."

Was searching for a place to get me out of my normal lunchtime location rut.  BOY, did I find the place, at least from a d√©cor standpoint.  Lots of &#34;stuff&#34; on the walls.  Think &#34;dive bar&#34; with an eclectic element to it.  It is VERY COOL!  As for the meal, with a sample of 1, it was great.  Had the HELLBILLY BURGER.  If you want it, you better like jalapenos.  I&#39;m sure the beer is cold, but didn&#39;t have one.  Server, Brittany, was excellent.  The place had lots of activity, always a good sign."

For me, it has everything I could possibly want...punk rock music, craft beer, and a creative, well-rounded menu, complete with hella burgers and kickin&#39; apps. While not every advertised libation seemed available, there were plenty of worthy options, and daily drink specials to boot. As for the food, my order of jala poppers were one of a kind. Deep fried, whole jalapenos packed with cheddar and cream cheese...an instant classic, and cheap way to my heart. Not for the mild stomach though, as they do pack a punch. Service has always been quick, and a spot at the bar nets a handful of TV&#39;s and your sports craving. Were the poppers not so satiable, I would have moved on to the inspirational burger menu. Maybe next I&#39;ll conquer the heralded &#34;Alpha&#34; burger or maybe some &#39;za... I&#39;ll be back! MUTHAA!"

This place serves wonderful and delicious American cuisine, is clean, has a cool atmosphere, is open late/early, and has live music.  What more could you want.

Seriously the food is fantastic.  The atmosphere of the place is great.  It&#39;s like old school rock &#39;n&#39; roll meets new age skater.

Definitely a place to check out if you are in the area."

After seeing them on Chicago&#39;s Best TV, I just had to give the zombie burger a go. It was huge and had a great taste. The added side of  jalapeno coleslaw was a real treat. I traditionally shy away from a vinegar base slaw and stick to a creamy one. So glad I gave it a try. 

My next visit to their fine establishment, I&#39;ll be trying their &#34;Better Be Quick&#34; (BBQ) chicken sandwich, with the jalapeno slaw on it, with a side of the jalapeno bacon cheese sauce and some tater tots.

Half off pizza Tuesdays/Sundays and open mic Wednesdays, with $1 burgers or tacos is very tempting too. Unfortunately (or fortunately, depends how you see things) I&#39;m not a drinker but their daily drink specials, Sun-Thu. seem very reasonable. They even have free food at half time when the Bears are playing.

My guess this place gets hoping on Fri. and Sat. with the live music. There&#39;s a nice size billiards room too. There&#39;s even a good number of tables along the east side of the building outside."

I came here for a show.  Now, I&#39;ll be the first to admit few places outside of Chicago (in Illinois) excite me.  Lombard...definitely not one of them.  I discovered The Ogden this night and therefore didn&#39;t want to leave that place to come here, but I did.  

The punk scene was a joke.  I&#39;m pretty sure Hot Topic threw up in there, which would have been fine if people were actually decent.  The girl at the front bar didn&#39;t know how to make drinks.  I tried a few and had to keep giving them away because they were awful.  One of the girls at the back bar was actually very sweet, but apparently couldn&#39;t hear me as she kept grabbing the wrong beer.  Like I said, she was really sweet so we kept laughing over it.  The other bartender was horrible.  Not only did she repeatedly try and not give me back change (we&#39;re talking $10+ worth), she kept forgetting which shitty beer was which.  Those weren&#39;t for me and I didn&#39;t want to taste them to find out.  

I enjoyed hanging out in the handicapped stall in the bathroom.  There was a big pink chair and a mirror.  Anyhow, I think the place as a venue is so-so.  There are a lot of spots where you could get stuck with no view at all, but if you&#39;re lucky enough to grab a spot by the bar, you&#39;ll have no problem.  Have napkins on standby for when your beer falls on the girl in front of you, because it will happen.  

I actually hated this place, but since I went there with a bad attitude and didn&#39;t eat anything there, I felt it would be wrong to give it a lower rating than 3 stars."

That&#39;s not to say that salads can&#39;t be manly.  We&#39;ve all witnessed taco salads so hideous that they should have been renamed &#34;death by fried tortillas and seasoned beef with a sprinkling of juicy shredded iceberg for bare minimum salad purposes.&#34;

Here at the &#39;House (Haus?  House.), they have a lot of deadly and gnarly sounding burgers, pizzas, salads and sandwiches to match the ultra-stickered, punk, and metal music decor and ambience.  El Capitan.  Bolt Thrower.  Attack of the Killer Tomato Salad...and those are just some of the pizzas!

I came here with a few buddies with the intent of jamming at an open mic.  We were thwarted one week because they only actually have one of the advertised two guitar amps, so we returned two weeks later.  We wanted food before we crushed it onstage, so I had the aforementioned salad.  Within minutes, a meal fit for Zeus himself was in front of me.  They did NOT skimp on the chicken, and it was seasoned perfectly.  Plenty of fresh parmesan and dressing took care of the fresh romaine, but the salad was no match for this rocker.

Service?  Kind of what you&#39;d expect here.  A little flippant, but mostly good.  The bar gets the best service, but all the servers seemed like they were enjoying themselves except ours.  There&#39;s always one who you imagine responds to every request with a silent internal &#34;Buh.&#34;, and tonight we got her.

All in all, a decent place to rock out with your butcher&#39;s block out, and catch some great live music.  Get down to the House!"

Waitress at the bar took a good 10 minutes to even acknowledge my existence and to place an order.  When I finally got to order, I requested to separate my orders in different containers, and specifically asked for substitutions and paid extra for it. Waited in the car for the food and came back inside a little after the promised time.  I got inside and I waited patiently at the bar and asked for my order and her response was. &#34;Obviously it&#39;s not in the window, so it&#39;s not ready yet!&#34; I said okay, I continued to wait at the bar for another 10 minutes and the food finally came and she sat it in front of my without saying a word and walked off.. 

She basically expected a tip because I ordered at the bar even though I ordered to-go. Not worth it."

This place is like Cheers except most of the staff and many of the patron have more skin covered by ink than clothes.  And, the food is lots better...

I had a Zombie burger, which was delicious, and a side of &#39;tater tots, which were also quite good and make the waitress very happy.  The guy next to me had their Tater Tachos (yep, more tater tots) which looked great and could work as a meal even though they&#39;re listed (and priced) as a starter.  The guy on the other side of me had a burger and... yep, tater tots.  (Turns out, he worked there and was given an extra large portion so the waitresses could snack from them.)  

I hope I don&#39;t get anyone in trouble with that last bit and, what is it with these Tater Tots?  But, I digress.

There&#39;s lots of different beers.  I tried several and they were all cold.  I like that in a beer.

The unusual thing for me, though, was the atmosphere.  It&#39;s not hard to find cold beer.  It isn&#39;t *that* hard to find really good food (however, not at these prices).  What *is* rare is to find a place you can walk into and feel at home.

I will definately make a point of going back there the next time I&#39;m anywhere near Lombard."

On Friday, I was finally able to check out the new and beloved Brauerhouse at its new and revamped location.  I have to say, I was more than excited to have our favorite bar back in action!

Located right off of 355 on North Ave, it&#39;s a quick and easy drive from just about everywhere.  Like the old place, there&#39;s no big, distinct sign to give away it&#39;s location.  Instead, it&#39;s tucked away in the strip mall near the Red Wing shop.  When you walk in, you&#39;re greeted by an awesome, hand-painted mural in the entry way.  The vibe is rock-n-roll and the interior is bomb!  Seat yourself at one of the booths, tables, or at the bar and enjoy one of the domestic or craft beers on tap... and some shots while you&#39;re at it.

I was highly impressed by the selection of beers.  There were great craft beers on tap, bells hopslam, metropoliton flywheel, stone&#39;s bastard.. etc.. not to mention a ton of bottles!! YUM.  Decently prices and delicious to drink.

Also- this Brauer isn&#39;t just for getting your drink on... there&#39;s FOOD!  Bring your family, kids, friends.. whoever.. and come grab a bite.  Right now, due to its brand new opening, there&#39;s a limited menu.. a handful of delicious burgers, build your own crackercrust pizzas, tater tachos and other foodies! Can&#39;t go wrong with tater tachos!! The food was delicious... got to get the fried snicker for desert!! 

And even better, soon, the menu will be filled with 50 different burgers, crackercrust pizzas, and more!  

As if great beer, a cool vibe, and awesome food wasn&#39;t enough... Brauerhouse also has bad ass bands and music!  Are you in a band?  Looking for a place to play?  You GOT to play here.  Give Steve a call and book a night.  Great sound, cool stage, awesome crowd.. LOVE IT!!

The staff is super awesome... cool and hot chicks.. a young and ambitious kitchen staff.. and owners who are probably the coolest dudes around.  You&#39;ll find them in Brauer at almost all times.. so make sure you say hi and have a shot.

So happy that Brauerhouse is back in action.. great place for families and friends during the early hours.. and for all you party animals at any time of day/night!

After settling in our seats, the cruella deville waitress comes by and asked if I wanted something to drink and I asked what the specials were, she starts repeating the specialty drink list. I asked her again and she then got what I was asking. $2 drafts.. I asked her what was on tap and she said she didnt know and there is a board that has them. 
We ended up going up to the bar and ordering. Service after that was good. We had the side of tater tots as our appetizer which is cooked in with fish. Not the best tots I&#39;ve had and the after taste of fish ruined that tot taste and crunch for me. Took a while to get our pizza which was xl half cheese half mishroom which was De-elicious!"

The ambiance is very upbeat and lively. There were plenty of TV&#39;s to watch the Black hawks game. The menu had plenty of options and there was a beer special. 

I ordered a blueberry wheat beer that I really liked. Wings were half off  and were really good; the BBQ wings was juicy and the sauce had a good, sweet taste. I also ordered a burger, I don&#39;t remember the name, but it had bacon, onions, cheese and of course, a pretzel bun. The burger was just as good as the wing. 

This is one place that the guys and I will be back and I see the next experience being just as good as this one."

They put me on hold and five minutes later they got back to me to tell me that they were playing at midnight.

We&#39;ve always been curious about this place and decided to give it a try on a Thursday night for an early dinner. My husband and I are not the demographic for this place, but we were treated great by Brittany R- she was such a hard worker and gave us incredible service. Great sense of humor too. 

We loved the decor and also got a kick out of the music. We kept trying to Shazam the songs to hear what they were but I think they were mostly live/independent/non-studio recordings. We did get to hear a ska version of Aha&#39;s Take On Me!

They serve RC products which is quirky but good. My husband found his new favorite beer on draft- New Hollands Dragons Milk. 

We had fried pickles for an appetizer. They were good and were served with a side of ranch. They were different than most places (and super hot- it took forever for them to cool off enough to eat) and were big and well-battered. 

We both got the Lux Interior burgers which are beef and bacon combined in the burger. My husband got it as listed on the menu, with cheddar and jalapenos and thought it was one of the best burgers he&#39;s ever had. He couldn&#39;t finish it and even ate the rest the next day, which says a lot since as you can imagine, burgers reheat a little weird. I got it more plain, and didn&#39;t care for it at all, so my husband ate mine as a leftover too! I tried the tater tots as a side after reading about them on Yelp, and they were pretty good. My husband enjoyed his fries.

They have chocolate covered bacon on their dessert menu and we will definitely give that a try next time. 

I read a lot on Yelp about the pizza, and we were happily surprised that they sell them frozen for you take home, so we bought one (only $5!) and tried it later in the weekend. It didn&#39;t have baking instructions (which I know isn&#39;t hard to figure out but it would have made it easier) but we thought it was really good and the thin crust was delicious. 

Overall, we had a good experience and I&#39;m happy my husband has a new place to add to his favorite restaurants!"

So it takes the first band like...an hour to just SET UP, and they have the music in between sets turned up ridiculously loud and they can&#39;t seem to play a complete song, which was just...irritating.  

So finally at10:15...for the first band plays.  I know I&#39;m going to sound like an old person here, but like...come on.  The headliner didn&#39;t start until midnight...and the sound was super not good.  I couldn&#39;t hear the second guitar player or the backing vocals at all, so that was totally unfortunate.

My short list of go-to Burger joints in Lombard goes Brauerhouse, DMK, Back Alley Burger, Tom &amp; Eddie&#39;s, pretty much in that order.  

This past weekend I ordered a pickup for myself and some siblings, getting the Alpha as a chicken sandwhich (love that any of the signature burgers can be converted to a Chicken sandwhich), the Rosemary&#39;s baby, and the mini-burger flight(Zombie, Crimson Gypsy, Bruiser).  The burgers here at Brauerhouse are definetely on the greasy side, but the pretzel bun they use is definately up to the task of grease absorbtion.  The burgers are very good, but be forewarned that any changeout on the sides (fries, tots, etc) is an upcharge, which they do not explain to customers (I think on purpose, as enough people complain about it that they can&#39;t be unaware that it&#39;s an issue).  

Of course, i did do takeout, so I only got 5 minutes worth of listening to the metal band playing on a weekend night in a standing-room only crowd.  If that&#39;s not your thing, be aware that this place can get crowded and loud.  And i can absolutely second Sarah S.&#39;s review that they have Dragon&#39;s Milk, which rocks all kinds of ways.  If you ain&#39;t dainty, this is a great place to grab a burger and a beer."

Attractive decor, great service, great food in a suprising location in Homer Glen.  Pricey, but generally worth it.

While mainly French in style, the cuisine would be better described as continental.  Table had mussels, smoked salmon, soup, filet, veal, fish...  all excellent if missing salt in a couple cases.

Chocolate souflee very good.  Only miss was rasberry cheesecake which was missing a crust and looked like a pile of mousse on my plate instead of the pretty picture they post on their FB page.

I had the lobster bisque which was divine, one of the best I have ever had. I followed that by succulent scallops and finished up with Crepes Suzette and coffee. Both were superb.

I was so wrong! Everything about this place is top notch. The decor inside, the staff, the bathroom. Everything was wonderful! Everything we add was excellent. We ordered a bunch of crepes and they were all very good and presented like 4-star cuisine. I ordered the beef bourguignon crepe and it was perfectly cooked. 
We also tried their dessert. Can&#39;t remember all that we ordered but there were no complaints about any of them from our table. The dessert crepes and the chocolate desserts were big winners.

It&#39;s in a strip mall but you walk in and everything is luxurious! There are floor-length drapes, ornate furniture, and thick, dimpled cloth napkins. The servers were svelte ladies with long hair and doe-like eyes decked out in black dresses and pearls.

Of course we got bubbles - Champagne - and it was lovely. We continued with Mussels Mariniere, escargot and a beet salad. The mussels were a little fishy, but the sauce was incredible: rich and creamy. The escargot was presented in their shells and we were given special utensils for removing and eating them. Divine.

All of our entrees were dreamy except for the fish of the day. The fish was vapid and unsatisfying. I got the Chicken Fricassee. It was tender boneless pieces of chicken in a buttery cream sauce served with sides of asparagus and garlic mashed potatoes. All I can say is that it was absolutely the best dish that I have had in a very long time. It was a true treat to eat.

M got the duck which was cooked perfectly. The skin was crispy and the duck was moist and flavorful. Everybody agreed that this was the way that duck is meant to be prepared and enjoyed.

One of our friends got the Coq Au Vin. It was absolutely delicious. Rich with brown gravy and deliciousness.

For dessert we had a pistachio macaroon (sublime cookies but frozen middle), sugar butter crepe and creme brulee. The creme brulee was unlike any other we&#39;ve ever had. I highly recommend it. The crepe was also indulgent in it&#39;s simplicity.

La Crepe Bistro was truly a special surprise and a hidden gem. I could not recommend it more."

They were both fantastic.  We capped off the evening with a &#34;homemade&#34; raspberry and pistachio cheesecake and a peach crape.  The cheesecake was good.  The sauce on the crape was too sweet, but good nonetheless.  The service was great and we would definitely come back here.

Mussels were a little old but the sauce was good. French kisses were a hit, prunes stuffed with foie gras. We had lamb shank, half duck, veal chops, sea bass, and duck confit.

From the moment you walk through the door , no, maybe just before, when you walk onto the patio, you feel as if you&#39;ve been transported to a quaint but elegant French bistro.
The staff are very accommodating and friendly. It seems that most (maybe all) are European and their accents are delightful. The servers are not only lovely but knowledgeable. 
The food. Oh! Have mercy! The food!!!!! I have been there for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Nothing I have ordered has ever disappointed me even slightly. Fresh ingredients, prepared with flavor and style. So delicious!
The people that I have seen in this restaurant all seem to succumb to the calm but joyful atmosphere. It is one of the few restaurants that I can think of where you don&#39;t have to shout over music or noise to have a conversation with your spouse or friends.
 The prices are not outrageous at all. We had a very nice bottle of beaujolais wine for about $25.

Pretty special if I do say so myself so we needed a special place to celebrate. A friend had recommended this restaurant and in spite of the fact that it was in a strip mall in Homer Glen we trusted her.

From the minute I saw the Eiffel Tower out front I knew I would adore this restaurant and I was right.

At lunchtime it is a definite &#34;Ladies who do Lunch&#34; kind of place, in fact for most of the meal, Cliff was the only man. 

The restaurant is large and comfy. Tables are spread out so you can&#39;t hear other people&#39;s conversations. Plus, you feel like you could talk with your hands and not smack someone. I love my space!

My only problem was that I wanted to order every single thing on the menu. As this is not a cheap place, that would have created some financial problems so I restrained myself. 

I talked my darling hubby into splitting a Coq au Vin crepe with me for an appetizer. It was breathtakingly delicious! It had a little salad with the best dressing I have ever tasted. If they sold that stuff I would be guzzling it right now.

For my entree I had the lamb chops because I am a fool for lamb. These chops were superb and came with mint jelly which I know is not trendy but I adore it with lamb. 

I accompanied this with crisp and tasty iced tea. When I requested additional ice in came in a goblet with tongs. Wow! 

For dessert I had one macaroon which was good. I also had the fresh peaches and cream crepe and I had to restrain myself from licking the plate. It was the best peach food I have ever had.

I accompanied dessert with coffee and sighs of pleasure. A very special luncheon for a very special day. Perfect!"

I just finished my sixth or seventh visit and I have never been disappointed in the menu. The wild mushroom soup is delicious and my friends tell me the French onion soup is also awesome. The crepes are so good.
The entrees come with more food than is listed on the menu. For instance, Steak and Frites also comes with a vegetable side, a small salad and a small serving of fruit, generally.
For the caliber of the food and the amount, the price is reasonable.
Finally, although it doesn&#39;t look much like the French bistros I visited in Paris, the atmosphere is pleasant.
We only had an off-putting experience one time. We had made reservations but the staff acted like they had no record of them when we arrived. They shoved too many of us in a back table by the restroom and the waiter acted irritated to serve us. Personally, I think they may have overbooked themselves that night or something but we&#39;ve never had any other issues before or since."

I took the little woman and she had the beef burgundy crepe and I had the filet with truffle sauce and the onion soup. The beef burgundy tasted ok, it was a bit better than dinty Moore. The onion soup was ok but did not have the depth of flavor as what one gets following Julia child recipe. And my fillet, I did not taste any discernible truffle flavor. The food was pretty good but not really worth the trip. Go on YouTube or find old Julia child dvd&#39;s and save your money and get a better meal."

It&#39;s about time we start seeing a little fine dining as opposed to what we have around here. Being greeted at the door was a cute touch to the great service from the Audrey Hepburn ladies :) 

It blows my mind on these bad reviews - first off have you really had French dining? Obviously not if your b!+‚Ç¨hing about only receiving one crepe (purple onion is down the street - stuff your face with crepes there). The crepes were done up nice, I had the apple cinnamon Carmel crepes, a taste of the asparagus mushroom crepe, a taste of French onion soup and the chicken spinach julienne.... All of it was awesome and made me full. The service was phenomenal too- relaxed, not overly being bothered - that&#39;s the vibe of this place though (mc Donald&#39;s is down the street and they have a great drive through window if you don&#39;t like the service at le crepe). 

The inside is very home like and classy. Not your typical modern dt chi restaurant. It lbs kind of in a category all by it self - fancy yet friendly! Def. a perfect place for a shower or party, date night or anniversary.

Eiffel towers, fleur de lis, french wine, crepes, cheese... I must be dreaming because I feel like I&#39;m in Paris.  This lovely french restaurant just gets better and better.  I imagine they get busy as well for brunch, but we came here for a Friday night dinner.  They seem to be the talk of the town because the place was packed!  We didn&#39;t have a reservation, but did not have to wait for a table.  The attention to detail here is truly remarkable, ambiance is spectacular, service is professional and friendly, and the food is simply divine!  Really, you will not be disappointed with this little hidden gem in the suburbs.

The Good:  With &#34;crepe&#34; in the title, you can&#39;t come here and not order the crepes!  The seafood crepe is always a front-runner, but today I tried the baked salmon crepe and I found a new favorite!  The salmon was tender and just melts in your mouth with the bechamel sauce.  Also, the escargots with chanterelles from the specials menu was heavenly!  If you&#39;re a desert person, you may have a hard time deciding what to order.  I know we did because there are just so many mouthwatering choices!  We split the crepe suzette:  traditional sweet crepe with vanilla ice cream, garnished with citrus fruit and kiwi.  Mmmm... we practically licked the plate clean! 

The Bad:  That I don&#39;t have a bigger stomach!  I would love to try something in addition to the crepes... but I just had no room.  I think next time, I will split a crepe as an appetizer and perhaps order an entree for dinner.  In true french fashion, they have duck confit and frog legs, too!  Would love to expand my horizons and sample other items off the menu.

The Oh-So-BEAUTIFUL:  I think the owner must have a background in interior design because the space has impeccable decor.  It&#39;s romantic, charming and unlike any other place I&#39;ve seen before with quality linens, vintage serving pieces, fresh orchids, domed cake plates, fancy dining chairs, mercury glass footed candle holders, modern crystal chandeliers and much MUCH more!  Every corner of the restaurant has its own focal point, so there&#39;s not a bad table in the house.  Come for a great meal, but you also get some marvelous ideas and inspirations for decorating.  Now, one thing that will definitely catch your attention are the adorable uniforms for the servers... the girls look stunning in little black dresses with an Eiffel Tower on a sheer back.  Viva La France in Homer Glen!"

The service was worse this time.  I felt like we were bothering the waitresses who clustered at the bar counter chatting. At least 3 times, we had to wave someone over to bring us water, iced tea, spoons, etc. even the bill!!!!! No one seemed to bother looking in our direction.  The four of us split the Farmers Salad and the Beet Salad.   Portions were plenty large, but they tasted like there was no dressing on either one of them.  Another wave of the hand brought the waitress so we could request more salad dressing.
We were told that the beautiful Eiffel Tower dresses the waitresses had on when I was here before, and I bragged to my friends about, are apparently only worn on the weekends.I was slightly embarrassed and we were all disappointed. When we asked for bread, we were told they only serve that at dinner.   And yet the menu has the exact same prices for lunch and dinner!

I currently live in Homer Glen and I can tell you that you will not find a place like La Crepe anywhere else in Homer or it&#39;s surrounding towns. With that being said, here is my review for you fellow Yelpers out there: 

As you walk in, you will typically be greeted and seated by an employee. The first thing you will notice is La Crepe&#39;s beautiful Parisian/Vintage like decor and ambiance. It automatically gives you a comfortable yet fancy vibe. There is no super fancy dress code expectation, so no worries- but I wouldn&#39;t advise pajama pants if that&#39;s what you&#39;re thinking. There is already a drink menu placed on your table already but you will be given a food menu promptly as you are seated. There are two divisions to this restaurant - one smaller dining section near the entrance, and a bigger, more private, dining area on your right-hand side. They also serve wine, beer, and other alcoholic beverages such as martinis. I typically come in with my girlfriends during the morning or afternoon to grab some coffee, mimosas and sweet crepes. Their crepes are pretty big and filling and their lattes (hot or iced) and cappuccinos are excellent. I can&#39;t speak for anything else because all I ever get are their sweet crepes, mimosas, and variety of coffees. All which are very satisfying and delicious. You could tell that they put in a lot of thought and creativity when it comes to your food and drinks because both will be wonderfully garnished and served. 

It has a European feel to it to serve it&#39;s purpose as a French Bistro. One main reason I love going here is because I have yet to experience a wait for a table. It is quiet, it is intimate, it is reserved, it is elegant, and it is perfect for lunch/coffee with a friend or whoever. What it is not - is a place for you to bring around 10 running loose and loud children after soccer practice. 

Service is very friendly, professional, and attentive. I would not say they are very expensive. For example, I pay around $14 for a cappuccino and strawberry with chocolate crepe. I wasn&#39;t aware that they do take-out, but I&#39;m not sure why anyone would even consider doing take-out here. This is a place where people go to actually sit down, relax, converse with one another, and soak in the ambiance. If you want to do take-out, I&#39;d say go to Chili&#39;s down the street or IHop in Orland Park ...

Regardless, I would definitely recommend this place if you&#39;re trying to go on a coffee &amp; sweets date, catch up with an old friend, business related lunch (there&#39;s no loud music to talk over), or that french bistro dine in experience with friends and family. It&#39;s mostly crepes tho ! Hence the title, La CREPE Bistro. They do have appetizers that are non-crepe related, though."

We were there for a baby shower. The decor at the bistro was very French charming. There was one server for a party of fifty so when I asked for a coffee three times before I received it I was understanding. When one of the guests asked for a different dish because of an allergy she was treated poorly and harassed throughout the event. They gave her a hard time making it VERY clear that she was going to be charged for a new plate. Then they went on to tell her, &#34;look around. Do you see how busy we are? We don&#39;t have time to make you a new dish. And if we do, YOU have to pay for it.&#34; When they asked for a manager they received the same response. Later, our guest went on to yelp about the experience and when the management saw the review they called our family member demanding the reviewer&#39;s phone number because they were outraged. The went on to say the guest was using vile language, which is not true of a mother of two who is a school teacher and who was surrounded by other guests who witnessed the interaction. This establishment is extremely rude and unprofessional and should probably try to work on their customer service instead of harassing a customer who just didn&#39;t want to eat something they are extremely allergic to."

The menu offers an interesting and unique array of savory and sweet crepe entrees.  The food is always excellent, and the service is outstanding.  I would give it five stars except for one thing - the pace.  If you have a lot of time to sit and enjoy a very leisurely meal, then you will enjoy the pace.  But, if you are in a bit of a rush and looking to eat quickly before moving on, you may be frustrated.  The staff will move quickly if asked, but I think the experience is meant to be relaxing, so they let you sit and relax without rushing.  It is a good place for children who know how to behave in a restaurant.  As a side note, the decor is gorgeous.  This restaurant is a &#34;must try&#34;."

Because of time restrictions, had to carry out rather than dining in. The wait was short, considering they were busy.

Ordered the turbinado sugar and French butter creeps and an order of fries. Meh. 

The order of fries cost $4 and it wasn&#39;t even the equivalent of what you would find in a child&#39;s meal. A few fries sprinkled with parsley. Not what I was expecting. 

The crepe (one single crepe) was slightly tough and greasy.

My favorite dinner entree is the steak frites which is a very tender filet mignon with a wonderful sauce that has a hint of blue cheese.  The French fries that come with it are also fantastic.

I&#39;d say they were at half-capacity at 1:45 p.m. on a Saturday so we were seated right away. The restaurant has a medieval theme to the decor and although the place has been around for years it is well-kept and in good shape.

We all had the burgers and they were just okay. I didn&#39;t detect any hint of their &#34;secret seasoning&#34; mentioned on the menu and it just tasted like grilled ground beef.  It was good beef &amp; juicy, though.  My father-in-law mentioned he didn&#39;t think the burgers were the same as several years ago when he was last there so either their &#34;secret&#34; recipe has changed or it&#39;s just not impressive anymore. Others seem to love their burgers so maybe we are just burger snobs now since we live near a place with fantastic burgers. ;)  Anyway, I thought it silly they charge .25 extra if you want a leaf of lettuce &amp; a slice of tomato for your burger. All burgers do come with raw or grilled onions, which was nice, and your choice of fries or a baked potato.  The fries were just your typical frozen fries popped in the deep fryer so nothing special there.

Their prices on draft beers, however, was really good!  $3.5 for a stein of Berghoff Dark? Yes, please. And only $11+change for a pitcher of it - that was a great deal for our table to share.

The service started off good and then after checking on us once after the food arrived our server disappeared for a long time.  It was about 10 minutes after we all stopped eating before we saw her &amp; flagged her down and then another 10 minutes waiting for the check."

What is with this knights of olde theme? At the risk of sounding elitist, it is a very middle class restaurant: middle class d√©cor, food for middle class tastes, middle class service (whatever middle class service is!) serving middle class patrons.This is the culinary equivalent of a bowling alley. 

But that does not mean that Alfie&#39;s isn&#39;t good.  If you don&#39;t ask too much of Alfie&#39;s you won&#39;t be disappointed. Their famous hamburgers are famously good. I often get their butt steak which is good tasting and cheap and a very nice meal when paired with their baked potato. Their house salad dressing, which I had today, is really very good.

This is a beer place, not a wine place. Alfie&#39;s is a little conscious of being d√©class√©. So, on every table next to the ketchup is a bottle of that highfalutin Gray Poupon  mustard.  I guess it&#39;s the mustard preferred by knights of olde."

Time of my visit: Very late dinner.

I should start by saying, I am a regular at the place.  So my opinion will be very bias, based on years of going there.  So take it however you&#39;d like.

I ordered French Dip with garlic sauce.  Their garlic sauce is to die for (if anyone knows of better, feel free to challenge me).  You really can&#39;t screw up French Dip, the meat was excellent, moist and delicious.  And to combo it with garlic sauce is just awesome!

The service has always been good, but yet again, being a regular, sometimes makes me wonder, but I always look around to see how waitress interact with other customers and I am yet to see anything short of excellent.

I came for a fish fry, and although unlimited fish for the price was great, the actual fish &#39;n chips wasn&#39;t anything to write home about. The second time I came I was coming with friends purely because of a Groupon we had gotten. Luckily we pointed out the Groupon at the beginning, because it turns out that even though we were on separate checks and (besides sitting together) not related in any way, the Groupon had to be at separate tables. So I sat at a separate table. It was an unusual meal to say the least, but we came there due to the deal and, having no intention of coming back, I wanted to use the Groupons up then and there. That said, the waitress did do her best to make the awkward situation as tolerable as possible.
Now to the food. As I already started at above, the fish &#39;n chips were rather bland and a bit soggy. The second time I came though, I got steak butt and deep fried mushrooms. The mushrooms were pretty damn good. Well seasoned, a good fry on them, and a very flavorful white garlic dipping sauce to accompany. The steak on the other hand was quite bland. I had asked for rare and they did do a proper rare, so props there. But I ended up eating it with A1 sauce as there was really no other flavor to speak of.
So in the end, would I come back? Maybe if friends were bringing me along. But Alfie&#39;s is not a restaurant I would seek out again in the future. The food is pricey for what it is and the flavors are bland. But probably worse than all that is just how outdated the place feels (and I don&#39;t mean the medieval theming). It&#39;s clear that this place had it&#39;s heyday back in the 80s or 90s or something and hasn&#39;t kept up with the huge array of new great and similarly priced restaurants to choose from in the area."

The place has a mild knightly theme, with chain link window paneling inside, stained glass, and two knights just chillin in the lobby. The place is adorned with model ships, fireplaces, etc. It&#39;s carpeted, the furniture is old, and the menu is cheesy (Sir Rueben of Rye sandwich, anyone?) and yet, it&#39;s comforting and familiar. Like your favorite diner, with chain mail.

I had the aforementioned Sir Rueben and it was delicious. Everyone at our table enjoyed their food. With cocktails, beers, onion rings as an appetizer and everyone getting a full meal, our bill for six people was barely $100. The staff was perfectly polite and functional and fine. They obliged taking a silly picture of us with the lobby knight. It was great.

I would definitely return for another night of average and inexpensive food and fun."

Which went great w/ their Roast Beef sandwiches, Burgers and onion rings which are still enjoyed today. 
 Stopped for lunch the other day and Id imagine the kids are probably running it now, Im sure the parents are retired or gone but still has good service. The BBQ sauce has remained tasty and fantastic &amp; although I didn&#39;t see onion rings or peruse for dark beers, I had the 
roast beef sandwich. Still same beef &amp; great recipe w/ lightly toasted buns. Dimly lit w/ a castle type interior. Still remains a good option for a burger or such. The menu has expanded from the old days and yes you can get a steak, ribs, fish n chips  in here. French dip is good too. Recommended!"

Their loin burgers are made fresh daily.  Went with the patty melt and upgraded to rings instead of fries.   Burger was fresh, onions grilled nicely and the rye was the right texture for a burger. 

For an app, always liked their fried zucchini.  It is served with a ranch sauce that has something different than your regular salad dressing.  Used it for the rings afterwards. 

Would rate this place a solid four stars, with one extra star for the nostalgia.   This place has been around for a long time for a reason."

They would be worthy of a five if they were consistent. But tonight my bun was chilled. Perfectly cooked medium rare burger. Fries pretty darn good too. Why the two stars?

Ribs were lame, greasy, lousy smokey sauce, and overpriced. Salad comes with packaged dressing. Coleslaw is bought from The Jewel I think. Chilled mug for my beer the server put the table napkin inside the glass, all three times I ordered (so it was planned for &#34;convenience&#34;). What finger germs ended up in my glass (i drank from the bottle instead). Owner should be less worried about who parked in his newly paved lot (using vulgarity as he described it upon my arrival (with my children). 

A Glen Ellyn classic that has seen better times. I will be heading elsewhere next time i am looking for a $10 burger."

I came here once a few years ago for their burgers... very good, but not life changing or anything.  Seeing I didn&#39;t have an awful experience here, I bought two double take deals to come back.  It&#39;s convenient, and they have a nice little low carb selection on the menu.  I visited Alfie&#39;s again last week on Thursday at 5pm - perfect time for dinner, it got pretty crowded soon after that.  I read great reviews about the ribs, so I decided to try them.  They weren&#39;t amazing but not terrible either.  I&#39;ve had better, but you get some decent ribs and a side for a decent price.  The meat falls off the bone, so that&#39;s always a good sign of decent ribs.  
We had two servers, I believe one was training - I believe that could have been a bit better, they seemed rushed about everything, and we weren&#39;t even sure they were going to bring back the change or were keeping it for a tip after paying the bill so we had to track one of them down.

The atmosphere in here is neat though... medieval kind of place.  I have another double take deal, so I&#39;ll be returning soon!"

I went to dinner there tonight with my boyfriend before a concert at the nearby MAC performing arts center. This popular restaurant has fast service- we were in and out in about an hour -  and a relaxed, happy atmosphere. I enjoyed a Mediterranean chicken burger, well seasoned, with good quality bun. it was served with Tzatziki sauce, and a baked potato for the side dish. my boyfriend had the chicken and rice soup. Both were good and a great value.

The menu is has a broad selection of burgers  (beef, turkey or chicken), and sandwiches. There are some entrees too.

I use to like this place when I was 12 years old, I went back 10 years later and the quality really is so-so.  The burger patty is decent, my bun was a touch stale.  The onion rings I still enjoy.  HOWEVER, I got a cup of chili and it literally was not chili at all -- it was like all the beans and meat in chili, served in chicken broth; there was no red coloring indicating the presence of chili powders of any sort.  No chili flavor at all.  I swapped it for the chicken noodle soup, which was pretty under seasoned and so-so on its own.  The side salad we got is pretty uninspired but adequate.

Prices honestly seem a touch high when you start adding sides to your meal and the onion rings.  There is a lot of competition in the $9 burger space these days.

I think standards of eating have increased a lot and this place is catering to their older clientele.  They are still packed, but for my druthers I think you can do better for a burger.  Which is a shame!"

When we pulled in around lunchtime today we were first surprised to see that the parking lot was pretty full. As we walked to the door we noticed that there was outdoor seating in front although it was closed today due to a constant drizzle. Inside, the restaurant and bar is a Tudor throwback: well done but dark. The interior seemed clean and well maintained and we were greeted and quickly seated. The menu has a nice mix of appetizers, soups, salads, sandwiches and entrees. There is a full bar with several domestic and imported beers on tap, as well as many wine selections. I had chili for a starter and it was meaty and delicious. It could have used a bit more spice and it was slightly sweet. That said, I&#39;d order it again as it was good. I had a Ruben that was outstanding: tender, lean corned beef, the perfect amount of sauerkraut, delicious bread, and not too greasy. I had a side of fries although a baked potato was also an option. My partner had a turkey burger that he said was pretty good. Service was spot-on, attentive but unobtrusive. We&#39;ll definitely be back to Alfie&#39;s for the food.

Excellent ambiance with deep cozy booths and warm fireplaces.

The menu is classic pub food. From Knights to Jokers, you will find something appealing on this loaded menu. My favorite is the Amigo burger, a classic 8 oz burger loaded with hot peppers. Other faves are the fish &amp; chips.

20 minutes later she appeared with our cokes  WE DID NOT LEAVE A TIP  I hope she figured it out!!!

As for the history it holds a special place in my mothers heart and was fun to share a great meal with her who&#39;s a long time Alumni to Alfie&#39;s who started hanging there in the 1960&#39;s during college.

  Although the waitress was professional and gets 4 stars the host and staff wasn&#39;t friendly or courteous.  We felt super rushed and was never greeted upon arrival or leaving.  Worse was the host who was standing outside upon our arrival and he didn&#39;t inform us that the entrance we were headed towards wasn&#39;t equipped with the handicapped ramp.

  Still the same place it was 2yrs ago and 12 yrs ago. Needs up-dating, a face lift something. Too dark, crappy carpeting, dark tables and chairs, are the trying to hide something?
  The waitress was very good, food was average and the same at least they are consistent  (I had the bacon c-burger).When I got home that burger sat like a brick in my stomach, had to lay down for three hrs for it to digest. still feel the effcts two days later.

I used to come to Alfie&#39;s every time I visited the suburbs, because my uncle loves this place. So do I. It worked out perfectly. Unfortunately, my trips back to Chicagoland have dropped in frequency, so as too have my visits to Alfie&#39;s. This past weekend was the opportunity to get back, and I grabbed it.

Glad to see nothing has changed at Alfie&#39;s over the years. N-O-T-H-I-N-G-G-G-G-G-G. You walk in and it&#39;s still clean but dark and somewhat...oddly decorated. Don&#39;t expect to actually see out of the windows or get much light in, as per the stained glass designs. The knights armor at the front door is interesting as well. There is also a fireplace which is actually nice on the chillier days.

The service has always been fine here. It&#39;s efficient and gets the job done, but will never be incredibly memorable. The menu is fairly simple, heavy on the burgers of course, but does have a few other things. That being said, I have never, ever had anything but a burger here.

My last burger was the mushroom swiss, medium rare, fries. It was out within 10-15 minutes at most, as is the norm. The burger was large and cooked perfectly - red inside, juicy as heck. The bun is standard. The fries are standard. But that burger...so moist and so flavorful. All of that for less than $8."
alfies-inn-glen-ellyn-2,Astrid O.,GIq6IJ4VMR2D-VNeoumqjw,"Glenview, IL",0,1,0,6,68,khdk7YLnZD9A4U_5HaZL9Q,4.0,2013-11-21,"We&#39;ve been coming to Alfie&#39;s regularly for over 10 years now. The first time we came here, it was on a fluke. We&#39;d never heard anyone talking about it but we&#39;d seen it while driving on Roosevelt, and one night we decided to stop in. It reminded us of the old dark restaurants from the 70s, and we felt comfortable there. The food was basically diner quality, but it was very fast and inexpensive. We weren&#39;t bowled over by Alfie&#39;s, but we liked it. We came back again relatively soon after that, when we were in the mood for a quick burger and a beer. And we found ourselves coming back, month after month... and now it&#39;s been 10 years and we&#39;re still regular customers.

Alfie&#39;s is one of those neighborhood joints that *everyone* goes to -- it&#39;s not flashy or gourmet, but it&#39;s quick, non-pretentious, and inexpensive. We normally get exceptionally fast service, and we&#39;ve only had a short wait for a table twice. I think I&#39;ve tried all the burgers, the butt steak, the chili, fish, tuna melt, and chicken -- in essence nearly the entire menu -- and it&#39;s all been good. I particularly like the burgers and the tuna melt. Our waitresses (I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve ever had a male server there) have all been pleasant and efficient. It is not the place you bring your date if you&#39;re trying to be impressive. It&#39;s the place you take your grandma when she&#39;s in town, or the place where you bring your sister&#39;s kids because it&#39;s something different for them. The atmosphere is very family-oriented.

I&#39;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because the two times I&#39;ve tried to eat &#34;healthy&#34; there, the salads were disappointing. I got the impression the salad had probably been made up two days ago and had been sitting in a fridge with plastic wrap over it. Not super appetizing. And I believe the appetizer options are basically all deep-fried. I understand that Alfie&#39;s doesn&#39;t change over the years, but adding at least one really great salad and one healthy choice for an appetizer would be very nice. I don&#39;t always want a burger and fries when my husband suggests Alfie&#39;s. Usually! But not always."

Well they didn&#39;t know it at the time but I love me some burgers! Like obsessed to the point I&#39;d say I&#39;ve had over 1000 different ones!

So I came here amped up with a small group of 5(odd number really). I told them all that I heard about the burgers and everyone was excited as well.

Then comes the burgers.. They are the definition of &#34;meh&#34; like nothing good or great about &#39;em! The group I was with even let out a loud collective &#34;sigh&#34; to signify our disappointment. (ok... maybe not.) But no one really liked their food.

In my group no one felt moved enough to wanna try it again. I also learned to never ask the same group of locals for some recommendations again for fear they&#39;ll advise me that Scientology is ok...

Skip this place!"

The inside of the restaurant is unusually dark with very little lighting as though they went around to every light in the establishment and somehow found light bulbs with single digit wattage and said &#34;let&#39;s roll with it&#34;. There is a slight medieval theme to the decor on the inside but for the most part this is a fairly straightforward attempt at a family restaurant.

I&#39;ve had a fair number of menu items over the years at Alfie&#39;s and I have always been pleased with everything I&#39;ve purchased. This goes with both appetizers like fried mushrooms, burgers and ribs. The most notable thing about Alfie&#39;s besides the very dark lighting scheme inside is that their prices are much much lower than other sit down eateries of its caliber. This combined with the fair quality of the food makes Alfie&#39;s Inn a winner in my book."

Alfie&#39;s is near my sister&#39;s house and she recommended it because of the fried mushrooms and fried zucchini.  Probably the best &#39;shrooms and zucchini I have ever eaten.  The breading was crisp, but not heavy, and even the last pieces never got soggy.  They came with a creamy garlic dressing for dipping, which was much better than plain ranch.  The sauce was really good on the baked potato.  Highly recommend.
Didn&#39;t feel like a burger, and my sister said the in-house made corned beef was very good, so I tried the sandwich on marble rye.  It was very salty, and I am not salt averse.  My sister tried a piece and said that it is usually much better, so I&#39;ll write it off to a bad day.
My sister had the Alfie burger and gave me a 1/4 to try.  It was phenomenal!  Reading the menu, it is ground in-house daily.  A half-pound burger that wasn&#39;t densely packed and very moist.  Although the waitress didn&#39;t ask for her preference in doneness, the burger came out a nice pink medium.  Perfect.  I will definitely have a burger next time.  Probably one of the best burgers I&#39;ve eaten at a non-burger specialty restaurants.
I enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant.  Very old-school dark wood and model ships.  It reminded me of restaurants from my youth."

It&#39;s an interesting place. There&#39;s swords and axes and stuff on the wall, interspersed with fading plastic American flags, because everyone knows America hit its peak in the middle ages....wait...

The menu is burgers, sandwiches, ribs, and all manner of fried foods. I would say at least 90% of the menu costs less than $12, much of it less than $10.  You would be hard-pressed to spend $30 on dinner for two. Including a drink.

I did not have what you would consider a healthy dinner here. We shared onion rings and then I had my &#34;seafood basket&#34; -- four fried shrimp, two cod filets and fries. Brown, golden brown, and light brown. Oh, and a pickle. The husband had chicken fingers and fries. It&#39;s a lot of fries. Like, basket-o-fries + fish on top.

Now, I hear the burgers are the way to go, so maybe next time. But nothing really overly impressed me this time. It was all competent and decent and fine, but no special flavor to the fries, nothing outstanding, just... fine. The food gets three stars.

It&#39;s the service and price that knock this place up to a fourth one -- our waitress was friendly and very on top of things. And you get a lot of food for the price. 

No dessert though, none at all save coffee and hot chocolate, or a sweet alcoholic beverage. We wanted something small to knock our bill up high enough to use a coupon ... so hot chocolate it was. Nary a brownie in sight."

The food is just okay. We shared an app of potatoe skins, but it wasn&#39;t anything to write home about. My bf had the reuben and he didn&#39;t even finish it. It wasn&#39;t repulsive, but the flavor of a good reuben just wasn&#39;t there. 

I had the &#34;Garlic French Dip&#34; and ate all of it because I was hungry, not because it was delicious. Instead of fries, I had a baked potatoe which was just average. I would say they give you ample butter and sour cream to top your potato with.

It&#39;s just an okay place. There are definitley better places to go."

We came here because our family group thought it was a good idea. 

I went for a burger because that is a specialty. I started with a salad, which was nice and crisp, with homemade vinaigrette. This was about the only healthy option on the menu. I also appreciated the option of a baked potato rather than fries. But I was underwhelmed with the burger and bun, and my husband found the ribs to be bland. My sons enjoyed their steaks (butt and New York strip).

It was a busy Friday night after Thanksgiving, but our wait was reasonable and the service was good. Noise level was a bit high."

Like I said the burger was GREAT!  Even my kids ate theirs!  Which they almost never eat more than half a burger.  Although I&#39;d recommend getting food to go, so you don&#39;t have to sit in the nasty dining room.  It&#39;s dark, old, and musty!  Seriously, it was actually muggy in there.  Did they flood recently?  I&#39;m seeing other reviewers describe the decor as medieval, but it&#39;s not like you might imagine.  Thinking Medieval Times -ish? Well don&#39;t! Think dark wood paneling, dark red/maroon carpeting, super old fashioned tables and booths, just like grandpas old basement.  

But like I said, the food is good, the decor is secondary.  But the musty smell and dampness makes one wonder about the cleanliness of the place. Just food for thought... Pun intended."

We have been going to Alfies over the past 20 years...and then moved about 2 hours away. So after a long time away, we dropped in for the memorable Sir Alfie&#39;s loin burger and fries. Service was swift and friendly. Our server was very attentive. The food was not what we remembered. The burger had very little flavor.  We ordered it medium, and it was much closer to well done.The fries were actually a bit anemic looking and limp...as if they were pulled out too soon. Since it was later in the afternoon and not the lunch rush, I expected the food to be better. I had heard that the son was now running the place, and I wonder if he had switched to a cheaper source of ground beef. 
In closing, we may come back for other items on the menu, but the burgers were a disappointment."

I came to this castle-themed restaurant on a Wednesday night, not expecting to have trouble finding a parking spot (always a good sign). The inside of the place hasn&#39;t been redecorated probably since the place was opened, but that&#39;s ok...this place has earned it with its reputation for simple but delicious tavern food. You can get ribs, chicken, sandwiches...oh, and burgers! This is what they are known for. Like a big dieting loser, I ordered their classic burger in its low-carb format (no bun, add cheese, on a bed of lettuce, with mushrooms and a side of ranch). It was good stuff! I sat at the bar and enjoyed a mug of Blue Moon while I waited...I wouldn&#39;t say this place is up to speed with good craft beer, but that didn&#39;t stop the bar from being a hoppin&#39; location. The bartender (a nice, attentive young lady) knew the name of everyone who came in to enjoy some soup and a beverage. I almost felt bummed that I had missed out on this big secret in the West Suburbs, because I was the only one there that wasn&#39;t on a first name basis!

This medieval (themed and aged) place probably doesn&#39;t ever need to change. A step back into time, nothing seems tired...the food is classic, the decor is fitting, the prices are ridiculously good, and the service is nice. I would love to see how popular this place is on a Friday or Saturday. More places like Alfie&#39;s should exist."

I love how LOW the prices are. I had been here before and got the exact same thing but didn&#39;t review it; Amigo Burger!!! I would be the Hispanic Knight (since this place makes you feel like you are in King Arthur&#39;s Court or Camelot). I got grilled mushrooms instead of fries because I am not a big white potato guy. My sister loves this place and we went for her birthday lunch! They were even nice enough to bring her a huge cupcake that we split at the end of our meal. This was in addition to the potato skins and LOADS of fries my grandmother complained about getting. She said &#34;I can&#39;t even them all&#34;. I wanted to say &#34;No one is putting a gun to your head, Carol&#34;, but I am not THAT big of a smart ass...most of the time.

The funniest thing when I went for lunch on a Thursday was that it was Old Timers Day. I think I was the youngest by at least a half century. I don&#39;t think I would have been served if I didn&#39;t have my grandmother with me. 

This place is a hidden gem in Glen Ellyn. I would say the sirloin burgers here are delicious. I want to say this place is a Renaissance of what a quick, cheap, and reasonable lunch. Again with the bun, I mean puns. 

I feel bad for all the wait staff that has to deal with these elders paying them 14% tips on such low bills. 

Don&#39;t expect to be blown away, but don&#39;t expect this place to blow. If you&#39;re looking for a great burger that won&#39;t give your wallet the plague, Alfie&#39;s is it!"

Meh. 

I feel it necessary to end it there since that&#39;s pretty much how I felt upon leaving Alfie&#39;s. However, I will elaborate. I think Renita M. got it exactly right. It&#39;s a dive-y bar that resembles somewhat of a castle, and offers a good ol&#39; fashioned family atmosphere. I wouldn&#39;t necessarily call it a &#34;medieval experience&#34;, but that&#39;s just me. I more or less felt like I was in a European pub.  If I want to dine in a real castle and have a real medieval adventure, I&#39;ll head to Europe. Or better yet, Medieval Times. 

Anyways...
Service was fine. We were in and out which is always a plus. The food was average. During my visit, I ordered the chicken fingers ((Yes, during my carnivorous days. I was on the cusp of going straight vegetarian )). The bf went with a bacon cheddar burger, and we split some fried shrooms and zucchini. Everything was okay. Nothing spectacular, nothing to rave about. It was decent. I personally don&#39;t think they have the best burgers in town, but that&#39;s just my opinion. It&#39;s not the place I would come for ribs or steak either. And as a vegetarian now, Alfie&#39;s Inn certainly doesn&#39;t offer up a whole lot of variety aside from fried veggies or a garden salad.

Conclusion = 2.5 stars."

The fish and chips are very good, but not particularly better than you&#39;d get at any quality restaurant. Good quality fish, good breading, not greasy, and great fries.
The ribs are outstanding if you like a sweet sauce and fall off the bone tenderness. And as good as the fries are, their baked potatoes are ah-may-zing.
But the real reason to go here are the burgers.  Oh. My. God.  The best burgers in the world.  I highly recommend the grilled onions, and ask them to cut that bad boy in half.  Good quality bun that is tender but stands up to the job without soaking through and falling apart.  Extraordinary quality meat, cooked as rare as you&#39;d like.  I&#39;m drooling just thinking about it.
Extremely fast service, friendly wait staff, and reasonable prices.  Good beer selection as well.  This place is a local treasure."

My husband and I enjoy the fact that they are open late on weeknights.  We are often out late with clients showing houses on weeknights and we don&#39;t want to do the drive thru all the time!

We recently bought a Groupon and went in to grab a quick bite (love Groupon!). I tried the turkey burger for the first time. I asked our server what she thought of it and she was very honest with me, telling me that it was an average turkey burger.  I appreciated that she didn&#39;t up sell it to try to get me to just order and be done.

 She was spot on! The burger was well made, but had minimal flavor. I had to add BBQ sauce to it. I was glad to try something new after years of getting the same three menu items but I have to admit, I won&#39;t order the turkey burger again.

We will be heading to Alfie&#39;s as a family in about a week to celebrate my Mom&#39;s birthday and I look forward to trying another new menu item!"

Alfies is place to go to eat.
NOT to dine. 
Yes, it&#39;s basically a sh!thole with kitschy decor, sometimes cranky waitstaff, and suspect seafood. Quit whining-you dont come to a place like this for seafood. 

Burgers, Ribs, Grilled Chix sandwiches, Tater skins, and other fried stuff. It&#39;s Bar food, made to eat with a beer, and not cost a lot. Basically one step up from a McDonalds, and a step below a good Chicago Greek Coffee shop/Diner.

They once had a branch out here in Oswego, and it was kinda like our clubhouse, for the wife and I. You could always count on solid American bar food, and the quality never changed. Is it Kuma&#39;s Corner? No, but it doesn&#39;t pretend to be, either. It&#39;s a Chicago-style bar pretending to be a restaurant. And that ain&#39;t a bad thing. The bastards closed the outpost and now the original in Glen Ellyn is the onliest one. I find it funny that this place thrives in the toney environs of Glen Ellyn, with Tony-er Wheaton lurking nearby. But that&#39;s the charm. It&#39;s a place to &#34;go eat&#34;. No dress code, no hushed voices, no specials. It&#39;s a great bargain.

Three stars, and don&#39;t take that as a negative thing. It&#39;s a casual joint, middle of the road. The food ain&#39;t gourmet, but it far from sucks-so in middle of the ratings it goes. Don&#39;t drive there just to visit the place-you&#39;ll prolly be disappointed. But if you&#39;re out in the WesternBurbs and come over all peckish, pass by the usual suspects, and enter this time slip that serves good workable food. And you&#39;ll have enough to have a pop with the foam on top. I take Blue Moon, I suggest you do, too!!"

Alfie&#39;s is the sort of place that we just sort of wind up at when we&#39;re in the area.  For great prices and delicious food, head to Alfie&#39;s.  

It&#39;s a little dark in there, but we like it.  It&#39;s nothing fancy, but the service is top notch.  Most recently, our waitress did everything right (which is pretty hard to come by at this price point)!  Full glasses throughout the entire meal.  Plenty of ranch dressing and BBQ sauce.  Extra napkins without having to ask for them.  The check at the perfect time.  

Alfie&#39;s has the best beer battered onion rings - dipped in ranch dressing, of course!  They come out nice and hot!  I can&#39;t think of an onion ring anywhere else that I like better.  The chicken fingers are always fresh and they give you plenty for a fair price.  Go ahead and add a couple of soup - it&#39;s only $1.75 - and it&#39;s more of a bowl than a cup.  

Oh, and kids 12 and under are currently eating free on Tuesdays!  They really do have something to make everyone happy.  Well, at least everyone in my family."

It looks like folks have been going here for awhile- dating back to before I was born. There must be a place for Alfie&#39;s in the local people&#39;s hearts, but for my first visit it was a forgettable experience.

I&#39;m wary of food from restaurants that look like castles- it just looks dated and unattractive to me. I ordered a bleu cheese burger, with grilled onions. Alfie&#39;s isn&#39;t the kind of place that will serve you an extravagant burger. It was a no-frills, just meat and cheese kind of thing on a bun. The bleu cheese was slimey and didn&#39;t taste real, the grilled onions were greasy and the side of fries was just o-k. The prices were very reasonable though, I&#39;m sure you can have a meal for two for under $20.

As far as the atmosphere goes, it was a bit worse than I imagined. Dimly lit with a cavern-esque kinda vibe, nothing really warm and welcoming about it.

Alfie&#39;s probably doesn&#39;t care about my negative review. I can see that there&#39;s a slew of regulars that actually like the place and people have been going here for decades. I&#39;d choose to stay away though."

I know this place has been around forever and it&#39;s a shrine to many in Glen Ellyn, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s anything special.

I&#39;ve been here twice. Last time was on a Sunday afternoon. Not very crowded but we did come to eat at a strange time (4ish). That red carpet has to go. This place totally feels like I&#39;m walking into Medieval Times, except here they&#39;re kind enough to give you eating utensils. But seriously, it wouldn&#39;t hurt for the place to get a mini facelift. Seems too dark, dingy, and unwelcoming. Almost like I&#39;m stuck in someone&#39;s basement.

The food is decent. The cream of chicken and rice soup was good. I&#39;ve heard the hype about their burgers but I wasn&#39;t blown away. Fries were just okay. Waitress was cute but sucked at her job. She spent a majority of our visit chatting with the hostess up front while I was dieing of thirst needing a refill.

I love the food, because to this day, I still believe that Alfie&#39;s has the best burgers around. Seriously, the burgers rock my proverbial world. As do the fried mushrooms in garlic dipping sauce. Helllloooooo happiness. The half order is huge! I also like to put garlic dipping sauce on my burger. Don&#39;t you judge me!

The place is done up all &#39;medieval&#39; style, with coat of arms and knights decorating the walls. Did it wreak of cheese? Totally, but I thought it was great. 

My boyfriend got the fish and chips and I got the half slab of ribs. Both were solid performers with enormous portions, but nothing I would go out of my way for. The drink specials were what stole the show. With $3 Bloody Marys with all the fixings and $5.50 Pi√±a Coladas, I couldn&#39;t believe the bang for your buck you get at this place.

For two entrees and two drinks, our total was exactly $30 with tip. I felt I got a good value for the price, but the service was mediocre and the food was nothing special.

Delicious sandwiches (I had the Down Under Chicken, with no-nonsense cheddar and bacon, on a kaiser bun), and cold beer would&#39;ve won Sir Gawain&#39;s approval, along with the dark, secretive atmosphere.  

Seriously, there&#39;s a wooden sign on the front door that remains warning against cigar and pipe smoking, and still one in the dining room proudly designating the No Smoking section.  Throwbacks aplenty with the large booths and the two cozy fireplaces indoors.

As Fair Lady Rachel J. noted, not a lot of frilly service, but it is good all-around.

I appreciated this, I hate when the table gets cluttered with plates because we usually try many items when dinning somewhere for the first time. Our server was nice but slow, at this level it&#39;s to be expected. Started off with the potato skins. They looked great and didn&#39;t skimp on anything. Sadly they were bland, the peppers saved the dish giving it some much needed flavor. Next was the chilli. Looked good but again bland and absolutely no spice. My dates salad was ice cold but had a pool of water at the bottom of the bowl. My burger came cooked a perfect medium with cheddar cheese. You can tell it was fresh but like everything else it had no flavor!?! The bun was to much for the burger. My dates fish and chips wasn&#39;t greasy which is rare, but also lacked any real taste. The tarter sauce which was desperately needed was good. Overall I&#39;d recommend giving it a try, I love supporting privately owned restaurants.

The fried rices are all great, noodle dishes are great, and the house Governor&#39;s Chicken is a superior substitute for General&#39;s Chicken. I can&#39;t say if it&#39;s authentic Chinese/Thai/Japanese, but I don&#39;t care. I want great food at a great price, I want to receive exactly what I order, and I want to really enjoy the food.

FM&#39;s Mongolian Beef absolutely destroys that $18 garbage from PF Changs, and their Thai offerings are better/tastier/more enjoyable than the food from a local &#34;Thai&#34; place.

Veg fried rice had a lot of nice veg buy could have used more seasoning and egg. The sesame chicken was a little on the bland side as  well but I did like that it was lean cuts of meat, not overly breaded and greasy, and not overly sweet and sticky.  A nice change!

Save your money and go elsewhere or buy frozen dim sum items at H-Mart and eat it from the comfort of your home."

The food was okay nothing special. Food was really greasy...I had heart burn for a whole day....the bathrooms are so dirty...pass this one up.  I know I will never return.
Tired of getting a reciept with no items on it...tired of not getting all my change back...tired of being abused.   Most of all the food is substandard."

Found this place on Yelp while doing a dim sum search on the map.  

The strip mall is not much to write home about...the few shops are unappealing.  Don&#39;t let that stop you, keep going.  Inside the restaurant isn&#39;t fabulous either but it&#39;s clean and the service is friendly.  It&#39;s quite small with 4 tables and a few more seats at the window.  It feels like this place is more geared to take out but I came here for dim sum and dang it I was going to munch on it fresh!!! 

The menu has 12 dim sum items.  I ordered 4 items.
Pan fried pot stickers 
Xiao Long Bao- soup dumplings 
Pan Fried Bun
Shrimp Dumplings

The soup dumplings and shrimp dumplings have 4 to and order and the others have 3 to and order.  They all looked great when they came out.  As I stated earlier probably not a ton of patrons dine it so it was served on some paper plates and a few steam baskets.  Pictures to follow.  Still don&#39;t let that deter you...the dim sum is damn tasty!   Shrimp dumplings....great!!!  Pot stickers....need more please.   Pan fried buns are also lovely....eat them fresh, not so fabulous at home 

The rest of the menu looks pretty fabulous as well.  This place makes great dim sum.  Don&#39;t be scared, try it!!!"

Just finished eating and I&#39;m already planning out what I would order next time it was so good. That doesn&#39;t seem right or normal to anticipate your next delivery order, but this place nailed it.  It was a last minute decision to order dinner and from order time to delivery it was just under 30 mins. I live about 3 miles away or about a 10 min drive.  I ordered the half duck, Singapore noodles and an order of egg rolls.  Food arrived hot and fast and done to perfection.  The duck was done just like I had it in Hong Kong.  So delicious and even came with half the head (I enjoyed the brain).  Duck was done perfectly.  The vegetable Singapore noodles were very good and lots of flavor.  The egg rolls were crispy, warm and tasted amazing.  I will definitely be ordering again and trying other items on the menu.  I highly recommend it.  Fast delivery and delicious food."

The rice noodles were really mushy too. There was very little filling in the crab rangoon and they just didn&#39;t taste right to me either. I had about two bites of everything and couldn&#39;t eat any more of it. I will not be ordering from here again.

We dined at many other places where the curry is  runny with watery consistency but here the texture is really perfect just like a fine dine restaurants we dined in the past .

There was another Chinese/Asian joint in this space before, and it was a lot scary.  These guys have been in there for 6 months, so I figured it&#39;d be OK to try.  I wish I hadn&#39;t waited- this is the BEST Chinese food I&#39;ve had in Lisle/Naperville.  There are some delivery issues, but I&#39;m telling you, the food is awesome.

I decided to order online through the Yelp app, as that&#39;s some new feature here.  I placed the order at 5:30.  We had 2 orders of egg rolls, a cashew chicken, and sesame chicken.  After an hour I still didn&#39;t have food (we live about 6 blocks away)- and sent a message via the Yelp app.  another 30 minutes went by, and a very frazzled Asian dude showed up with some food.  I say &#34;some&#34; intentionally- an order of egg rolls was missing, and the cashew chicken became cashew vegetables.  My kids were starving and I didn&#39;t feel like waiting another hour, so I let it slide that the order was wrong.

My kids started in on the sesame chicken and ate the entire order between them!  I had the cashew vegetables... they didn&#39;t even need chicken.  The food was seriously some of the best I have ever tried.  It was cooked perfectly, not greasy, and the stuff was as fresh as can be.  I&#39;m so happy about this... it&#39;s been a PITA to find a great Chinese place in the last 3 years.

I&#39;d not hesitate to give them 5 stars if they could get ordering right.  I think if they do, this place will take off like gangbusters.  I&#39;m looking forward to eating here again, but I&#39;m going to pick up so I can check the order myself."

The orange chicken, Mongolian beef, beef stick, shrimp egg rolls, mapo tofu, chicken/beef lo mien, Singapore noodles, and hot and sour soup are all pretty good from here. The pricing isn&#39;t too bad.  The food portions are bigger than most Chinese take out places.  The owners are super friendly.  I love how affordable their lunch options are! They even come with a drink and huge crab rangoons or egg rolls!! We order from here every so often and haven&#39;t had our order wrong yet.

It was nice to bite into the chicken and beef and not feel like I was chewing on a piece of fat. You can tell they use quality ingredients! Sadly, I didn&#39;t care for the egg roll but my husband enjoyed his. My husband also mentioned how clean FM168 was when he went to pick up our food.

So, the website has the wrong menu, which depending on what you order can be super confusing for everyone involved in a phone conversation.  I guess it&#39;s for the Indiana location.  If you see a grey menu with some green accents and at the bottom it typos &#34;Dinners On The Gill&#34;, that&#39;s not the right menu.  After some confusion on everyone&#39;s part, the gentleman on the phone realized they might have some mistakes on the website, and hopefully it gets changed.  Anyway, we had stuff chosen and then it turned out it wasn&#39;t available and we kind of ordered by the seat of our pants quickly with the order taker kind of throwing out ideas for us.

We ordered pan-fried dumplings, some manner of vegetable with garlic sauce and orange shrimp.  Dumplings were well prepared, looked really nice, and were okay.  It&#39;s not a top dumpling in my mind, but solid.  The orange shrimp had a very tasty sauce.  The shrimp was super-breaded, which my wife found a bit off-putting but I was okay with it, though it did make the shrimp seem really giant (and round).  It also came with 4 bits of broccoli.  My wife was seeking out the vegetables, and she was kind of disappointed.  A ton of water chestnuts, which she hates, and a ton of some sort of cabbage, which she&#39;s also not keen on.  That and some garlic sauce that wasn&#39;t immensely garlicky.  

Now having a real copy of the menu, it has a lot of promising looking things on it.  So I&#39;m looking forward to trying it again.  It was a decent place, I thought, and we&#39;re in an area that&#39;s blessed with a lot of good chinese restaurants.

It looks like a decent takeout place but with a decent amount of seating.  Order at a counter with a menu on the walls (or a paper takeout one).  On calling in an order they gave me a 5-10 minute timeframe, though it was kind of early so probably pretty quiet."
