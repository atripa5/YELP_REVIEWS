It was busy today for lunch, but not ridiculously so.  We were seated as soon as we walked in.  It took a few minutes for our waitress to come to us...but we were patient.  After we put our order in, we waited 35 minutes to be served.  :-(

The Eggs Benedict was delicious, but the english muffin was burnt.  One child chose the Silver Dollar Pancakes..well there was the right number of them but they were kinda messy looking (like how I make them but not nice neat silver dollars like we expected.  However, he thought they tasted good. My other child chose the Chocolate Chip Mouse pancake.  It appeared incomplete.  He was disappointed that it didn&#39;t have all the toppings that were described on the menu. 

I couldn&#39;t find the waitress to explain any of our issues with the meal so we ate it anyway without saying anything.  In fact I couldn&#39;t find our waitress at all until 15 minutes after we had finished eating.  We were looking forward to having ice cream for dessert, but I wasn&#39;t willing to wait another 20 minutes to be served that when we had already been there for an hour.

When we paid, I mentioned the very long wait to the manager.  He was apologetic and said that they weren&#39;t expecting to be so busy since some schools were in session today. 

All in all, we will be back again someday...but we won&#39;t be rushing back."

Colonial Cafe is a great family restaurant for my all time favorite meal of the day: BREAKFAST! Sure they have lunch and dinner menu&#39;s, but if you&#39;re not here for breakfast or their dessert, whatcha here for?

Grabbing lunch with a few friends to celebrate a friend&#39;s anniversary, we squished together in a cozy booth. We all love each other here, so no problem getting nice and cozy. 

Donna, I think, our server greeted us immediately and took our drink orders right away. Poor thing had difficulty talking because she lost her voice, but she was still nice and attentive. 

Knowing I have a holiday parties later this month, I opted for the healthier menu and got a Tri-Eggthlete Omelette, I think it&#39;s called, which included egg whites, scallions, broccoli, mushrooms (that I omitted) and I think tomatoes. It came with fresh fruit and multigrain toast. Our good came out quickly and it was delicious! 

For those who know me, I LOVE food, and that&#39;s an understatement. I showed no mercy to my breakfast and ate every bite! Satisfied with my breakfast, I know I&#39;ll be back for more to try, especially their signature Kitchen Sink ice cream dessert. 

Overall, I would definitely recommend friends and family to Colonial Cafe."

So one day we wanted to try someplace different for lunch so I suggested Colonial Cafe. When we walked in I notice at least five tables that were dirty, full of used plates and cups, there were filthy. That was my first suspicion. Once we get in and were seated, the waiter comes to us confused if we had ordered or not and we said &#34;no&#34; he later realizes we are one of his tables. That was the second thing. Next we placed our order, my husband ordered the spinach, feta and tomato omelet but asked for no tomatoes and if he could ADD bacon with a side of English muffin. For myself, I ordered a special they were having called Sriracha breakfast nachos which consisted of fries topped with tomatoes, eggs, cheese, chorizo, AND sour cream and avocado. When we got our food, my husband did not have his bacon or his English muffins and I didn&#39;t have my avocado or sour cream. (Note that I NEVER said to leave those two items off my plate) we complained to the waiter and all he did was remove $2 off our bill. Not once did the waiter decide to go back into the kitchen and give me my missing items or my husbands. Our waters were never refilled and the table next to us stayed filthy for 15 minutes, which is discussing. I was under the impression that it was just my husband and I that were experience this bad service but found out the women in front of us by the cashier ALSO had a bad experience and another gentleman as well. This place seemed like a nice new place to try but the service was HORRIBLE! I think with new management and more attentive employees this place would actually have some great potential. Will not be back here."

There was food all over the ground and the chairs are caked with dust. I had the French onion soup and it was pure salt (and I like salt) I just couldn&#39;t eat it. Our server was also not around at all. 20 minutes after we wrapped up our food to go, we still couldn&#39;t find her and had to get another server to find her. The food was mediocre at best and it was expensive in relation to the poor quality. The chicken salad was dry, the lettuce was dark and mushy. We will not eat here again. There are far better diners in the area."

We were waiting to be sat for quite some time, we even tried getting the attention of one of the ladies that was by the ice cream counter, and she completely ignored us, when another server walked past and said someone will be right with us. We waited about 10 more minutes after we were sat just to get our drink order taken, (by the server who ignored us at the door). The food we ordered was delicious, but the service was just awful. She dropped off our food, and just walked away, when 3 drinks on the table were clearly empty, we had to waive her back over to ask for refills, that took another 10 minutes to get. After we were finished eating, we waited another 10 minutes or so before she even came over to ask about desserts. 

The only reason I gave two stars was due to the guy making the ice cream. HE brought over our desserts, HE went back to get the spoons for the dessert that the waitress didn&#39;t bring, and was even nice enough to get my kids some extra gummy worms. He even apologized when bringing all that, as well as at the checkout counter and gave me some coupons for free small desserts. Doubt I&#39;ll be back anytime soon."

I was highly disappointed in the way the manager handled customers waiting for seats. The back room was designated for the event. Since it was packed, we asked for a table outside of that section, especially since there were MANY open seats. Evidently, they didn&#39;t have enough staff working. It would be understandable if the restaurant was packed, but it wasn&#39;t. We heard the manager Barbara yell to her staff that, &#34;They will have to wait at least 20 minutes.&#34; Unfortunately, half of our group left due to unorganized and inept manager."

The kids enjoy being able to pick from a variety of meals off of the kids menu.  The only issues I have are with the bathroom, the old carpet and the decor that goes uncleaned.

Food-fine, server-nice, customer service-unacceptable :(

My daughter ordered off the kids menu but I noticed was charged for an adult drink ($2.29 instead of the kids drink $.99). I brought it up to the cashier and he said, &#34;well.. did she get an adult drink?&#34;. I explained that she is nine and clearly ordered off the kids menu (not my fault that the server brought her an adult drink.).  Apparently, it was up to my daughter to specify &#34;kids sprite&#34;.
I also had a coupon on my phone for five dollars off if you spend over $30. My bill was $35.71. He called a female manager over who told me, &#34;well, i can take the adult drink off and replace it with a kids drink, but then you cannot use the coupon because you will be under $30&#34;. I asked how replacing $2.29 with $.99 would bring my bill under $30 when it is $35.71?  She explained that the coupon is only good before taxes are added in. I then asked her to try it and see what happened. Clearly, it was still over $30. She seemed irked and let me use the coupon- then told me that I needed to physically delete the coupon off my phone in front of her do I couldn&#39;t use it again. What the?? For a business to make a customer feel uncomfortable and disrespected for their own error is not cool. Boo."

We came for lunch and there were 5 groups ahead of us and NONE of them were checked in. The same guy working the register was also working the seating booth. When we finally got seated, the waiter was swamped and took a while to get to us. It took forever to get our food and when we got the pasta with meatballs, it was frozen! I&#39;m not even talking about a little cold, but frozen to the point where a knife could not even cut through! The sauce on the pasta was hard and crusted and it looked like last night&#39;s leftovers. Of course we sent it back and it took even longer to come out the 2nd time. By this time, we had already been at the restaurant for over an hour, our lunch break was over and we still had no food. We came here because they&#39;re known for their ice cream and the waiter didn&#39;t even bother to ask us if we wanted dessert, she just plopped down the receipt and left. We didn&#39;t even get the ice cream that we came for.

I would NEVER recommend this to anyone. Stay away!"

They loved it so I had to try it with them last week for a fundraising event of my son&#39;s school.

It is a nice typical Cafe place. The decor is kind of dated. I really liked it as all staff there were happy to see us. My kids played with the cow statue a bit at the entry. We sat down in the middle of tables full of families with young kids. The waitress was super friendly and nice. 

We went after dinner so we had the frozen yogurt, the Oreo shake, and the strawbery ice cream. I don&#39;t think whoever could complain about the sweet treats. All of us left very content. I enjoyed the smiley faces of our waitresse and from the cashier.

It was disgusting it was more of a salad then anything and really I was just dissapointed.
I really didn&#39;t expect much

Fast-forward 15-20 years:

Crabby staff, messy tables, wild kids running around, and mediocre/overpriced food. My waitress forgot my side dish, charged me for it, and never apologized after I corrected her. Her response was &#34;that only gets ordered like once a year.&#34; After paying I asked to see a manager, who decided it wasn&#39;t important to come out as I waited almost 10 minutes.

Decent prices, huge desserts. Our last trip however will probably be our last. 

One of our children has a gluten allergy and although they have GF options he doesn&#39;t do well with their GF meals. So we had picked up a lettuce wrap from jimmy johns next door for him so he could have something while the rest of us ate at CC. We walked in and the waitress practically yelled at us for bringing outside food, first she said &#34;you can&#39;t bring that in here!&#34; She yelled at my son and my husband. I approached her after thinking that she doesn&#39;t realize my one child has an allergy but that doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t support CC as a local business we would still go there. As I explained she was curt and rude, I tried to smile and explain his allergy. She could care less. She admonished me in front of several tables with people who were surprised at how she was speaking to me. Family friendly? Not so much. My one son had to eat his lunch outside on the porch steps with my husband who stayed with him while the rest of our family and friends were inside waiting forever for slow food and slow service. What happened to this place? 

So much rides on customer service. Waitstaff could have approached this in a more pleasant and understanding fashion. Say something like... &#34;I completely understand your child&#39;s allergy. We do have GF options but if he reacts to them we certainly understand. Unfortunately we can&#39;t allow outside food to be brought in, can he wait to eat it?&#34; Instead of &#34;you can&#39;t bring that in here!! It&#39;s the rule and the law!&#34; She apologized to me after as I was leaving and paying the bill. I told her to think from a parents perspective when you have one child who can&#39;t eat while the rest of us can and think about what you are telling him to go and eat outside.

My son ate his food outside thank you for treating him like a dog.

We will never come here again thank you Debbie."

I met my husband here for lunch the other day, and they told us to sit wherever we wanted.  We chose the absolute back of the restaurant because we had my two-year-old son with us, and we didn&#39;t want to disturb anyone.  Well he would play (loudly) with his Colonial Cafe Squeezable cow (available for purchase!) and I would apologize.  they assured me not to worry, that it was just a little boy having fun.  How sweet!  I am always worried about disturbing other people while we&#39;re out!

But now most importantly, onto the food!!

My husband ordered the cinnamon roll french toast and I got a burger and added soup and a salad.  It was that kind of day!  The chicken noodle soup was a great warm-up for the winter, and I always have my side salad.  The burger was well-cooked, and the fries were good.  I don&#39;t know if I would order it again, but it got the job done!

However, the cinnamon roll french toast was to die for!  I love icing, and this definitely had some to spare!  Delicious!!"

The fries were good, the cole slaw was over dressed, and the muffin was okay.  It came with a pre-packaged honey butter that was tasty.  The real disappointment was in the fish.  It was crispy but lacked any flavor.  Needed seasoning desperately.  And though it was not an &#34;all you can eat&#34;, it ended up being more than we could eat as it wasn&#39;t all that good.

We did not have the ice cream which seems to be the major draw here.  Possibly that experience would be a better review."

Bear in mind, I grew up in the neighborhood in which this place exists, and have been going there for roughly 27 years at this point.

They recently redesigned the interior, which was much-needed.  It already looks dated in a weird way that I can&#39;t identify, however.  This place is still noisy as can be.  It&#39;s definitely a great place for families and kids, but if you&#39;re looking for a date locale, look elsewhere.  Unless you want to do an ice cream / milkshake kind of date thing.

Turtle Sundae is the best.  Oreo shakes are classic and never disappoint.  Avoid the cheddar soup unless you have iron bowels or a decent insurance policy that might cover colonic issues."

I reccomend their breakfast and dinner, nothing in between. The breakfast weekday special (4.99) is a steal but its hidden in the menu, check it out! For a delicious and healthy dinner, get the charbroiled mushroom chicken, you will not be dissapointed.

I chose the Vesuvio Panini - which had the driest chicken I&#39;ve ever had.  It made me wonder when the chicken was cooked - it could have been a day old.
My friend had The Ultimate Skillet.  What a disappointment!  The first time it was brought to the table it had the incorrect potatoes.  The 2nd time it was missing the bacon and the cheese wasn&#39;t melted on the top.  How many times does it take to get it right?!?  For the price paid, it was a very small skillet.  There are many other breakfast places in the area with similar skillets for about a dollar less.  The waitress said that the manager was &#34;going to take care of it&#34;.  When I hear those words, that means that you&#39;re not going to pay for this meal for the inconvenience, but nope - it was on the check.  This &#34;quick lunch&#34; turned into an hour and a half.  
Apparently, management was not aware of the local schools being out for President&#39;s Day weekend and the restaurant appeared to not have enough staff on hand.  There was one person, I&#39;m assuming the manager, that was seating people and taking care of the cash register. We had to wait in line to pay while he was sitting other people.

Colonial&#39;s has been around since I was a little kid, maybe longer than that but I just don&#39;t remember. You come here for one of two things:
1) diner-style food w/ a cozy feel
2) good ice cream sundaes and their kitchen sink sundae

I have many fond memories of Colonial, and friends who have worked there when I was in high school. The food is good, from breakfast all day to good sandwiches, even turkey dinners, which are pretty awesome too. Service is always great too.

My favorites are:
Biscuits and Gravy
Fresh roasted turkey
Country fried steak
Egg salad sandwich with bacon (yep, with bacon)
Any of their breakfast egg/meat combo platters
Banana split sundae

The kitchen sink is great to share, it will serve 4-8 people depending on how much you eat. It&#39;s like, 12 scoops of ice cream or something crazy like that. Just something fun and tasty!

To top it off, they actually serve Cherry Coke here, like a good fountain shop should! I love it! So few restaurants serve cherry coke nowadays."

Despite being pretty full for lunch, the place was amazingly subdued noise-wise (always a plus with me). I started with the Loaded Potato soup, which was a good rendition (and served suitably hot -- too often soups come lukewarm at restaurants; bah!), then had half a Ham and Swiss sandwich, which came on marble bread, but the juice of the melon that was served on the same plate had soaked into the bread and made it soggy and also gave the sandwich a rather odd flavor. The melon needed a separate bowl or something, because that combo is not going to catch on. 

To drink I had a vanilla root beer, which was tasty. I was too full to partake in any of the offerings from the huge dessert menu, though the &#34;Mini Treat&#34; would have been about right (a scoop of ice cream and a topping for $1.99; Peppermint Stick ice cream with hot fudge sounded good to me). They also have shakes, sundaes (including the evidently infamous &#34;Kitchen Sink,&#34; for which you earn a bumper sticker if you finish eating it), and other frozen goodies. 

This place seemed to be a servicable lunch option, and definitely a dessert destination, near downtown Naperville. So if you&#39;re in the area, come to Colonial Cafe and stake your claim."

The breakfast scene and the dinner scene are completely different. Most of the servers at breakfast, from what I can tell, have been working there since we first started eating here (almost a decade ago), whereas the servers in the evening seem to be mostly high school or North Central students. Not that there is anything bad with having some young blood on the scene, but it is nice to roll in and have Juanita spout off your usual order to you before you open your mouth, even if you haven&#39;t been there in a few months (the woman as an insanely awesome memory).

The breakfast food is good, I&#39;ve never been disappointed by the biscuits and gravy or the waffles. My wife and my mother-in-law always go crazy for the autumn specials, and the cinnamon swirl french toast is a favorite as well. Service is also usually quick, and always friendly.

The dinner food is what you would expect from a little diner like this. The burgers were a little dry, owing to the fact that they seem to cook everything to a medium-well without asking. I skipped the burger the last time we were here and did something I have never done... I ordered the $13 steak from a diner. But wait, there&#39;s more! It was a $13 steak plus all you could eat fried shrimp. I have to admit, it was really damn tasty (probably owing to the fact that they drenched the steak in a very yummy garlic butter sauce). The service was a bit slow this night, but by the time we finished our deserts, all service deficiencies were forgotten.

Overall, this is a place that I don&#39;t believe pretends to be something it is not. It&#39;s a neighborhood diner where people come back to to eat food they&#39;ve ordered a hundred times before. One word of warning, if you come here for breakfast on a Sunday morning, the place gets very busy with the post-church crowd, so try to schedule your visit around the mass times of the local churches!"

Colonial Cafe is a nice, family friendly place with reasonably priced food and delicious ice cream desserts.  

Don&#39;t come here expecting a fine steak dinner.  Burgers, sandwiches, and a few other meals, though, are great.  Their omlettes and such seem to be popular, although that&#39;s not my thing.  Pot roast and turkey dinners are good comfort food at a good price.  (Ask for extra gravy.)  I love their chicken quesadillas and burgers, but my favorite is their Friday Fish Fry.  On Friday only, they offer fresh fish, batter dipped and fried that&#39;s tastier than any fish and chips I&#39;ve had.  Warning: they do serve fried fish on their regular daily menu, but that&#39;s your typical frozen fish fingers.  The fresh fish is a Friday only thing.

Ice cream is very good.  My only complaints are they don&#39;t have much variety in flavors, and they are very stingy with the whipped cream.  They seem to have an &#34;attitude&#34; that the ice cream is more important than the whipped cream, but their whipped cream is so good...  Their hot fudge and butterscotch caramel sauces are excellent.

Service can be variable.  They make extensive use of teenagers in server roles.  But they do teach them well, and if you&#39;re not happy with something speak up to anyone working there.  They have always gone out of their way to fix any service complaint."

I got the beef dip sandwich and my husband got a burger with some french onion soup.  The beef was fine, but the bread was to chewy and the dipping sauce was way to fatty.  My husband was disappointed in his burger (which is hard to do).  Also he had to send it back because he asked for no mayo and it had mayo on it.  We had a coupon for a free tulip sundae which was good, but it&#39;s hard to mess up ice cream."

Definitely not worth it. But I wouldn&#39;t mind coming back to try dessert."

I&#39;ve been going to this place for years, and I have to say, I definitely miss it now that I&#39;ve moved out of Naperville. It&#39;s one of those places where you&#39;re just guaranteed to have a good experience. Throughout high school, the huge platter of cheese fries was the &#34;splurge&#34; to treat yourself to every once in a while (they used to serve it with a variety of dipping sauces...if you tell them you want it like &#34;they used to do it,&#34; the waitresses who have been there a while will know what you&#39;re talking about). Desserts are obviously one of their specialties...they have a huge dessert menu and they&#39;re known for their massive Kitchen Sink dessert. (Btw, if you finish it, you get a bumper sticker!) My personal favorites are the PB Chipper or just a good old-fashioned float. Some other menu items worth trying are the cinnamon french toast and the chili. You will not be disappointed if you stop by this place. It is often full with many &#34;regulars&#34; that have been going for years, but the service is great and you won&#39;t be let down."

Around the table and in no particular order we had the chicken quesadillas, a patty melt, meatloaf and soup and everything was really tasty. I&#39;d call the place pricey but not expensive by any means, the total for four of us was about $30 and with free refills on drinks I gotta say the Colonial Cafe was worth the trip. 

Now for the bad news. The service leaves a whole lot to be desired. I understand that all the kids are home from school now and so there&#39;s tons of &#39;em working as waitstaff but seriously, is there any sort of screening process? Our waitress managed to stop by maybe twice the entire time and had to be nudged about refilling drinks. But while my wife and I waited on my mom and sister to arrive she hounded us about ordering drinks or appetizers so when it came to running the bill up, she was attentive as can be. Yeah.... shady. 

Overall come for the grub and pay no mind to the hired help. I chalk it up to inexperience and age. We didn&#39;t get any of the ice cream inventions but next time I&#39;m sure we will."

Overall feeling about Colonial Cafe--eeh.  I felt like CC is on par with IHOP.  If you want good breakfast food, go to Egg Harbor instead.  Price-wise, it&#39;s not that different &amp; Egg Harbor is equally as kid-friendly.

It&#39;s like 2 banana splits in one (2 scoops vanilla, 2 scoops strawberry, 2 scoops chocolate, and two full bananas).  It comes with a bumper sticker too.  My favorite sundae is no longer on their dessert menu anymore but they&#39;ll still serve if you ask.  It&#39;s the Strawberry Fields Forever.

Anyway, we visit Colonial frequently-my dissenting vote usually gets overuled- and I never really enjoy it. The food is just O.K., I think the best thing on the menu is the CA Grill (turkey salad sandwich), and my wife likes the meat loaf, and I guess my daughter enjoyed the new 4 cheese mac and cheese-she&#39;s something of a connoisseur.  The other staples are marginal at best; the reuben appears to be comprised of Buddig corned beef, and the fish and chips are a joke.  The icecream specialties are tasty, although they always arrive about 20% melted, and the appetizer onion rings are very good.  The service could also use improvement.  As someone else mentioned, the majority of servers cannot yet vote."

The menu here is unbelievably extensive.  Pastas, soups. salads, burgers, pizza, wraps, sausages, sandwiches, and desserts will cater to even the trickiest of eaters.  Since it is counter service, the huge menu was almost overwhelming for a first time customer, but there was little pressure from the cashier, and I had a bit of time to think things through.

I went with a small Italian beef sandwich combo meal.  I got the fries as a side, although I could have paired it with a soup or salad for a small additional cost.  After placing the order, you are given a number to display on your table, and your food is brought out to you.  Drinks are self service with free refills.

The beef sandwich was pretty good, with a nice garlic spice to it, but the fries were sort of on the generic side.  Next time, I will definitely upgrade to soup or salad.  

Eating in was rather enjoyable, since they had plenty of staff clearing tables as customers left, and also kept the drink area spotless.  Although busy at dinner times, it had none of the frantic madness that is usually found at Portillo&#39;s."

BB actually just opened a new store in St. Charles a few weeks ago.  It&#39;s only 2 blocks from the absolute BEST beef sandwich place in all of Chicagoland,  &#34;The Beef Shack&#34;.  Beef Shack looks like a &#34;joint&#34; and is really kind of dumpy looking, but the beef is absolutely great!  Get the cheesy beef on garlic bread and get the  fries too.

Both of us were very impressed with our meals and said we thought their beef was even better than the Chicago staple Portillos! Besides the high price ($22 for lunch for 2) we were very satisfied with our meal and we will be back!"

Their food is head and shoulders better than Portillos. Their Italian beef has a slight kick to it, and they are much more generous with it on sandwiches than their competition. I&#39;ve also had their burgers, pizza, and chicken and had no complaints. They are a standby for catering for my family as well."

Beef sandwich sounded good. On Thursdays the special was buy a pizza get one but not what I wanted.  I ordered a beef with hot peppers and cheese. For the side I went with the chips. Service was quick delivered to my table with a friendly smile and asked if I needed anything else. The beef was good and the chips were different. Parmesan chips, they were a bit over cooked some burnt not too much flavor. Co worker had fries that looked good and by the way he ate they must have been. Not a bad place quite a few items on the menu, large space. It filled the need and the workers are happy and friendly."

All those forms of delicious animal flesh that aren&#39;t necessarily good for you, but they sure taste good!  Everything in moderation, right?  Well, maybe not so much when you come to Buona.  It&#39;s darn good, and a fun place to stuff yourself after you run 20 miles (as I did before coming here)!

I think people mistakenly assume Buona is a knock-off of Portillos.  In a way I think that can be argued, but I also think there&#39;s enough variety on this menu to make it sufficiently different.  The place itself is a bit more upscale than Portillos is, too.  The difference is that Buona has a lot of &#39;artisan&#34; sandwiches, whereas Portillos is all about huge portions of basic food.   The salads here are good, and I&#39;m also a huge fan of their chicken caprese sandwich, something Portillos could never pull off well.

I was pleasantly surprised to see they had beer, too.  Not just beer, but Peroni and Moretti, two of the better Italian beers.  The service was great- the guy that was cleaning tables was super nice and even pretty funny.  Since I was filling a 5000 calorie hole, I was not in a good mood when I walked in.  By the time I left I felt as if I had achieved some sort of italian beef nirvana.

Definitely like the chain, and this location in particular.  I&#39;m a fan and I will be back, for sure!"

They have a pretty large menu and we haven&#39;t had a chance to get through all of it yet.  But so far, the beef sandwich, the meatball sandwich and the chips (side dish) are all big winners in our household.  The food is comparable to Patio &amp; Portillo&#39;s, both in quality and price.  But we&#39;ll have to come back to try some of the other items like the pizza or ribs.

I had a coupon that  got me a packet of beef for 5 beef sandwichs, a whole loaf of Turano bread, and hot peppers.  Now I got to see first hand how this beef really is.  When I ripped into the package I saw all the spices all over the meat, and now knew for sure that this is loaded with the spices that taste O so good.  Making it myself gave me insight as to what they are all about and I was satisfied.  People, you do not need Portillos anymore, this is the real deal, in fact, the only other place you need is Johnny&#39;s Beef all the way out in Elmwood Park, but hey many of us, like me do not live anywhere near Elmwood Park, so I will go to the second best beef sandwich in Chicagoland.  
I tried the Angus burger and it was way overcooked but I could tell it would have been good as a fast food type burger, I just wish they would not have left it on so long and charred it to death.  
This location in Bolingbrook is a little disorganized, they forgot my hot peppers once after I paid for them, I called the manager when I got home.  He seemed concerned and took down my address so he could send me a coupon; however, he had a foreign tongue and had a hard time understanding my address no matter how clearly and slowly I spoke.  I was annoyed and of course I got nothing in the mail, I had to rely on a VALPAK for coupons.  They need to replace their management and they would probably operate better, luckily I love the food so much that I did not knock off stars but if my patience keeps getting tested I will come back and knock stars off."

Don&#39;t let the name fool you; yes, they have great Italian beef but that&#39;s just the beginning.  They have a great variety of dishes - personal pizzas, chicken sandwiches, burgers, bbq beef, ribs, hot dogs, salads and even a grilled salmon sandwich.  All sandwiches can be upped to a combo with drink and choice of side ( fries, kettle Chips, soup and more). hubby had the medium size Italian beef with giardenera and mozzarella cheese which he really enjoyed - nice and juicy with a good bread. I ordered a salad with peppers, pine nuts, pasta and chicken which was very tasty. We ended with a deliciously creamy cannoli with a perfect crunchy shell perfectly plated with whipped cream band drizzled chocolate sauce.  All this for less than $25!
Service was excellent. We ordered at the counter and the food was promptly delivered to our table. Both the manager and another employee stopped by to ask how we liked our meal. I&#39;m already planning a return visit."

During our first visit, we went inside to order take out and the wait staff and management was super nice to us.  They want to cater to us and want us to be returning customers.

The competition for beef sandwiches in Chicago is pretty steep, with Al&#39;s, Portillo&#39;s, etc.  I would definitely go back in order to get a better idea of how each place stacks up against each other."

 slight twists to the usual standards (like Salmon Eggs Benedict or cream of mushroom soup with spinach and tomatoes).

B.) The manager fired someone right in front of us for not removing Syrup from her table.
C.) He literally fired every caucasian person but Denise because he only wants hispanic people to work there.
D.) There are 12 year old kids working in the kitchen. Isnt that illegal?!

Having received 4 star ratings from two respected Yelp friends of mine, Kristina&#39;s made it onto my itinerary when I planned an outing in downtown Downers Grove. 

I arranged to meet a friend here for lunch. She and her kids arrived first and got a table in the back. &#34;The back&#34; is where you hope to be seated when dining with four kids under four.

My son&#39;s kids meal looked really nice. Two mini burgers and a generous portion of very fresh fruit. I wish I&#39;d snapped a pic, but apparently he was starving and inhaled the entire plate immediately. His buddy had a Micky pancake that he seemed to enjoy. I wish I could say my burger (cheddar jack) was impressive, but it was really just eatable. It actually had very little taste, which is odd for anything with cheese. I chose shoestring potatoes as my side because they sounded interesting, but they turned out to be just slivered chips that were difficult to eat without looking like a wild mongrel.

Aside from the food, we found the service inattentive. I waited with an empty water glass for what seemed like a very long time, especially considering that there were only three or four other tables occupied on our visit. I almost think they were hoping we&#39;d get the kids packed up and leave more quickly if we weren&#39;t well cared for.

Even though this was a semi disappointing visit, I think I&#39;d give Kristina&#39;s another chance...maybe I&#39;ll order something different in hopes that burgers just aren&#39;t their strong suit, and maybe service would be better on a different day.

The food is really good, very healthy portions and a great bang for your buck.  The menu is very extensive, so it took us a bit to order.  I got the Kristinas Skillet - with no jalapeños - added green peppers and had toast instead of the pancakes (included).  the BF had one of the grove combos - eggs, meats, pancakes, coffee and juice.  Everything was delicious.  I guess if I had one minor criticism it&#39;s the salsa that came with my skillet.  It was clearly from a jar - if they just made a simple pico de gallo, and had the option of a few tortillas instead of the pancakes/toast, this dish would be over the top delish.

After looking over reviews of previously unvisited breakfast places I decided to make the trip there to give it a try. After walking in I was offered seating both inside and outside and decided to stick to the air conditioned indoors. 

After looking over my menu options, I settled on a meat lovers skillet and chose pancakes as the extra option. I then waited a little bit longer than most places for my food to be ready, but once it was out I was excited to dig in. The skillet here was excellent, the amount of meat in the meat lovers skillet was definitely satisfactory. The pieces of meat were both abundant and thick. There was also a good amount of cheese on this skillet. The eggs were soft and well prepared as well. The potato at the bottom of the skillet was a little on the bland side, this along with the slightly longer than normal wait are my only complaints about the skillet. So the positives were lots of thick cuts of meat, lots of cheese. The negatives were somewhat bland potato at the bottom.

The pancakes here were also good, there were two berries for eyes and a strawberry for a mouth on the top pancakes. This extra charm puts a tingly feeling in the back of your head and makes you feel special as you think to yourself &#34;Awww they made a face on the pancakes.&#34; The pancakes themselves were soft, the powdered sugar gave it a dash of extra flavor. These pancakes were good as well.

Overall I was quite impressed by both the food and the service at Kristina&#39;s Cafe. Things like the face on my pancakes give it that extra bit of effort and caring that really shines through, they don&#39;t cut corners on meat or cheese which is somewhat common among breakfast places. I am going to give Kristina&#39;s Cafe four stars, a recommendation and I plan to visit again."

Aside from the rather creepy owner who is around 50% of the time,  the staff is quite inviting. Not your usual toothless Greek restaurant servers. Food is consistent and not bad. The washrooms could&#39;ve used an upgrade about twenty years ago,  but the owner makes up for it by keeping the urinal filled with ice. That said I eat here couple times a month and I&#39;m not disappointed,  but maybe part of that is I know what to expect. I suppose what I&#39;m saying is keep your expectations in check and Kristinas will probably exceed them."

Giving a two star rating is even being generous for this place. Anyways, I decided to stop by today since we were in the area. Seeing as how we&#39;ve never been here before and since you can never really go wrong with breakfast, we decided to give it a try. We walked in, and I noticed that it was very spacious in here, almost too spacious for a breakfast place. After we were seated, I also noticed that the noise level is absolutely silent in here. Not a good place to have a conversation--I felt the need to whisper. I mean I could almost hear the guy sitting next to us chewing his food. 

Okay, so let&#39;s get to the food portion, shall we? I opted for the Three Cheese Omelette, hash browns, and pancakes (it&#39;s a Friday during Lent). And this is where my meal absolutely took a turn for the worst. Instead of having mozzarella, jack, and some other cheese in the omelette, I received a half-melted slab of Velveeta in the center of some fluffy eggs. The menu said nothing about Velveeta, so at this point I was like &#34;how the hell could you mix that up?&#34; We decided not to complain to our waitress, because it would be futile since we knew we weren&#39;t coming here again. The pancakes were spongy and also had an elastic quality to them--which I hate. The two people I was with got a frittata, which was burnt and flavorless, and a smoked salmon omelette. The smoked salmon omelette was actually &#34;okay&#34;, which was the ONLY redeeming quality of this place. 

Overall, the meal was just flat out horrible. I didn&#39;t think it was possible to mess up breakfast this badly, but I was yet again proven wrong. To whoever gave this place a good rating: I would love to know what you were smoking when you wrote your reviews. The hunt for a great breakfast still continues."

The food is great and the service is wonderful.  The place is always clean.  We go every few weeks and request our favorite waitress, Ciara.  She is the sweetest!  My husband and I usually get omelettes, the 2 kids split a kids&#39; pancake meal and with coffee and juice, we average $30 or so.  It&#39;s reasonably priced and the food is really good.  I change my meal at times and I don&#39;t think there&#39;s ever been something I was uninterested in.  Sometimes I order their specials which are delicious- their Cream of Chicken soup on Sundays is delicious!  I guess I&#39;d have to say sometimes the coffee tastes a little bitter, but they have the flavored creamers at every table so with a little bit of creamer, it tastes fine.  They also have a stack of napkins on every table- VERY convenient for families with little kids!!

The booths are comfortable.  We use a highchair every time.  I guess I&#39;d prefer the highchairs were a little bit cleaner but I can just as easily wipe one down before putting my kiddo in it.  We are always greeted with a smile when we walk in and the kids love to go and pay the bill because they each pick one of the complimentary suckers by the register.

They have outdoor seating which we&#39;ve yet to do.  With a dog bakery a couple doors down, you will see TONS of people walking their dogs if you sit outside.  We just like to see them from the window.  

Parking CAN be difficult if it&#39;s a beautiful day.  We often times have to park on the side street instead of Main Street due to no parking available.  The area is perfect.  There many boutiques and shops all along the street.  You could easily head here for a breakfast and make a morning of shopping afterwards.  Nearby there is a bakery, dog bakery, ice cream/yogurt place, toy store across the street, kids consignment shop down the side street and book shop down the road.  Super fun.  We also tend to eat breakfast first and then head down Main Street afterwards for a super quick walk just to get to the train station and watch the trains for a bit.  There is also a beautiful fountain by the train station which is super popular.  Also, look out for the Farmers market that takes place in the Spring/Summer.  Our routine becomes eating breakfast here and then heading to the train station for some fresh produce to bring home."

For brunch I ordered the Main Street Prosciutto Omelette, which was pretty loaded up with prosciutto (obviously), red peppers, mozzarella, and other standard omeltte ingredients like mushrooms and onions. The side of hash browns was pretty good; I liked how they were more like shaved potatoes rather than your typical stringy hash browns.

One con of Kristina&#39;s--if you&#39;re hungry, you may want to ask for some crackers or something. I&#39;ve yet to have a rapid turnover from seating to ordering to dining. 

The food was awesome. Special requests were accommodated, and they poached me the most beautiful egg in the world. The crepes were really tasty, and I couldn&#39;t help but eat all of them. YUM!

The waitresses are phenomenal, and know their food ingredients and preparations well, which is a huge benefit in my life as my roommate and I both have lots of allergies (gluten and soy highest ranking). They make notes and take great care in the preparations of our food, and we haven&#39;t EVER gotten sick. This is to say A LOT because it happens to us a lot more than it should when we go other places. 

Their food is phenomenal, and comes in large enough portions you could share, if you wanted to (you won&#39;t though, have your fork weapon ready). Personally, I could eat their French toast for the rest of my life and be completely ok with that, and their omelets could cure the worst of hangovers.

Service is always good, and portion size is very large.  We have had a variety of the breakfast and brunch-type items and nothing has managed to distinguish itself -- apart from the fact that is walkable from home.  

I will add in its favor that it does not have that dark, depressing feeling that a lot of the other Greek-style family diners on, say, Ogden have.  And as a rejoinder to the pet-friendly outdoor seating mentioned in other reviews -- if you are seated outdoors, you might wind up sitting next to someone&#39;s pet.

I went back with a friend last week and she ordered the skillet with asparagus and said it was delicious.  Some of the food is classic Greek, i.e cream of chicken rice on Sunday but still solidly good.  Highly recommended.  I&#39;m going back for sure!"

Overall, it was a nice experience.  The inside is fun, with light colors and a generally open feeling to it.  It was quite busy for a Sunday morning, like most breakfast places are, but we had no trouble getting a seat or the attention of our waitress, who was very friendly.

I&#39;m not a fan of restaurants that put a slice a lemon in your drinking water; however, I am a fan of cucumber in the water.  As such, Kristina&#39;s Cafe put me in a difficult position when they put both in my water.  

We ordered the fresh fruit crepes, which were good, but were covered in powdered sugar, despite no mention of that on the menu.  The powdered sugar reduced the healthiness of the item, which was under their &#34;Healthy Living&#34; section, or whatever it&#39;s called.  But they were good, as were the potato pancakes, which tasted like they had included cream cheese and chives.  The turkey sausage was fine, but nothing remarkable.

Overall, the bill for two meals, one side, and an OJ came to about $25, a little higher than I expected, but not by much.  If I am in the Downers Grove area again during breakfast time, I will not hesitate to return."

The food was bland and didn&#39;t seem fresh, very disappointed ...There was also a  disturbance in the restaurant, a man who I think was the owner was being very rude to a woman and her 2 small children . Seems like he was forcing them out , not sure what this woman could have done to deserve such rude treatment  with what looked like a 1 and 3 year old. It was very uncomfortable and I felt like the woman was being bullied . This along with the mediocre tasting food is reason enough for me to never return here and I cant recommend it to anyone.."

We both ordered breakfast items, however, which they serve all day.  The interior is nice, just a basic hometown diner - which I like.  The service was good, everyone was very nice.

They have a pretty extensive menu, so it took a long time for me to decide what I wanted.  In the end, I ordered the biscuits and gravy.  They are my staple breakfast diner food, so i like to try them out whenever I go to a new breakfast place.  They were really good.  The gravy wasn&#39;t too heavy, not too overly spiced and had just the right amout of sausage.  Biscuits were light, fluffy and fresh.  My roommate had a scrambler and hashbrowns.  He said his food was great, too.  He also ordered an orange juice that turned out to be 3.25 - little too spendy, in my opinion, especially for this place.

All in all, a great little restaurant and I definitely will go back to try more.  We ate for under $20, including that orange juice."

The service was great but the food was mediocre.  We kind of felt like at the end of the meal we should have stayed home and made breakfast instead.  My food was good, but what looked to be a delicious side of fruit was not ripe and I didn&#39;t eat 3/4 of it.  Not a great place for vegans FYI as the people there don&#39;t know what that is.  It was enough to get us full and have us leave b/c at the end of our meal, we wanted out with the screaming children running around everywhere.

The food can be very good and quite reasonable. Sometimes there is some variation depending on who&#39;s preparing the food, but for the most part it is consistently good. My only gripe is the service. A blond, middle-aged female server is top notch and a real dynamo at tending to all her customers in a timely manner. Other servers just don&#39;t compare and it seems to be related to whether the owner is there. The other day I asked a male server for a coffee refill and it never came. After 15 minutes or so, I walked over to the back and he was eating something and quickly retreated to the kitchen when he saw me. Of course, the owner had already left the restaurant. Standards diminish drastically when he is not there and with the blond server, it simply doesn&#39;t matter because she just does an excellent job. Today I went elsewhere (Egg Harbor, which is across the street and around the block) and both the food and service were excellent."

We sat where we could people watch out the windows overlooking downtown Downers, a view that is hard to beat in the area. I had one of their skillets, it was really well done, with perfectly cooked steak and eggs, and generous portions. My son had pancakes, and the picky little guy at faster than usual. The real drawback, and hopefully this was a one off, was the service. It took over ten minutes to even get a cup of coffee which the host had to get for me while yelling across the room to get our waitress. The other waitress seemed to be on the ball though, so maybe this isn&#39;t indicative of what we should expect. I&#39;ll return, and will write again."

Kristina&#39;s Cafe has an ideal location on Main Street in Downtown Downers Grove and although the street parking may be limited there is a parking garage a block away  to accommodate its customers. The restaurant is designed for high volume capacity, so even on the weekends when its the most busy there is never that long of a wait. 

The owner Lance, has made a menu that appeals to everyone so even the pickiest eater will find something they will enjoy. Personally, I am not much of a breakfast person, but I do recommend any of the ten styles of Eggs Benedict, yes I said ten styles. The lunch menu includes a variety of wraps, salads, burgers, paninis, and sandwiches. The Tuna Salad Italiano sandwich is phenomenal, it&#39;s served open faced on an English muffin. Kristina&#39;s serves two soups daily and a version of Chicken Noodle is always one of them. Soup is always included with your sandwich order as well as your choice of side.  I work in the area, so I frequently order food to go and they always ensure that you have everything you could possibly need with your order. The website allows online ordering, but you can also call in. When I do dine in the servers are very attentive and take excellent care of you. If you live in the area or you&#39;re in town visiting, Kristina&#39;s should be your go to breakfast destination."

I decided to try this restaurant on the spur of the moment.  I will not be eating anything until dinner.  The Meatlover&#39;s Skillet did quite a job on me --- filled my stomach to the esophageal sphincter.  This menu item was one find in a huge breakfast menu.  It is a wonderful skillet of eggs, hash browns, cheese, bacon, ham, sausage.  I am not sure what else.  Normally, I do not eat skillet breakfasts, but I did and do not regret it too much ( I really am stuffed).

Service.  Outstanding.  Still, I expect that especially when there are only a few other customers.  Cleanliness.  Absolutely.  I do like it when I see the wait staff checking on empty tables and getting the help to clean tables when they weren&#39;t cleaned properly in the first place.  Sitting down at a table that is dirty/sticky is no fun.  I doubt that could happen here because the staff really seems to care about cleanliness.

The decor is pleasant and open.  I sat in a booth for two.   That is a problem for me since I fit very tightly in a &#34;standard&#34; booth.  Fortunately, the tables move and I was alone.    I think there are some tables with chairs, but I didn&#39;t ask since it didn&#39;t matter today.  It may when I come back with my wife - a booth might be kind of tight for me.

I will be giving this place another try, probably with my wife."

However, each experience I&#39;ve had has been worse than the last. Certainly, this last visit will be my final. I took my 6 y/o son for pancakes and after 5 minutes of waiting at an empty register, I found the Manager and asked to be seated. My son and I were given a table for two - lovely. There was silverware on his side, nothing on mine. Neither place had coffee cups. I&#39;m not a &#34;picky&#34; person - I spend my money wisely, tip well, show respect to the restaurant (and workers) and expect a good job in return. After placing our order I noticed that the half wall we were sitting next to was covered in dust. Not just a spot here or there, literally a layer. I have kids and am not easily grossed out, but this was disgusting. After 20 minutes of no water, no waitress, etc. I went to the back, where our waitress was standing, and asked when our order was coming? &#34;Well, you ordered when a lot of people came in so it will be out soon,&#34; was her reply. At 30 minutes of waiting for 1 Mickey Mouse pancake and 1 vege. skillet, I told my son we were leaving. He swore he could wait 10 more minutes... and we did. 40 minutes(!) after placing our order, it was delivered. Again, I had to ask for water and silverware. My son said his pancake was &#34;OK,&#34; but a &#34;really small Mickey face.&#34; My vege. skillet was 80% mushy hashbrowns, 10% undercooked egg (literally the white was not cooked), 10% vegetable. I will say that they did use fresh broccoli and that&#39;s nice. We didn&#39;t see the waitress again until she dropped the receipt at our table. Before leaving I noticed that two other tables had requested to see the Manager - one woman was served the wrong food and was treated rudely and as were were leaving another couple in the outside area were expressed displeasure at their whole experience. Sorry, Kristina, you&#39;ve lost the business of myself and my family."

There&#39;s definitely some flaws to the establishment. All menu items are not created equal. There are some very standard items, and then there are items worth revisiting over and over again to the detriment of my waistline.

Do yourself a favor and take the Kristina&#39;s Skillet or the Pumpkin Cheesecake Pancakes. The Kristina&#39;s Skillet is a spicy but delicious mishmash of eggs (your choice of scrambled or sunny-side up), jalapenos, ground beef, and thinly sliced potatoes. The skillet also comes with a side of either pancakes or toast. The pumpkin cheesecake pancakes are self-explanatory: pumpkin-flavored pancakes with incredible cheesecake sauce drizzled on top. Those are the standouts, and the reason why I love this place. They also offer a kid&#39;s menu, for the little tykes in your life. :D To be honest, I don&#39;t really get anything else even though they offer lunch. It&#39;s a little risky too, since I&#39;ve gotten some pretty sub-par food before. 

The prices are reasonable and range from $7-12, not including coffee. I do have the admit the coffee isn&#39;t robust, but if you just get normal coffee, you&#39;ll get refills. 

The service as whole has been very good. The staff is friendly and prompt, and you can always ask them for suggestions for good food if you&#39;re at a loss from the huge menu. 

Kristina&#39;s Cafe may not dazzle or impress the food connoisseur. But honestly, if you had a choice between wearing a business suit or a sweater at home, you&#39;d choose the sweater, right?"

Advertised as pan seared, it can breaded, with leathery tough exterior and horribly overdone inside.  There was no sign of flake anywhere.  The chef owes the fish an apology for this one -- sad, just sad.  Too bad I left my Birkenstocks home, I could have resolved at least one...  I&#39;m sure i&#39;ll be back, but I&#39;ll order something else.

The outdoor seating is a true oasis in this very busy shopping center. Both service and ambience left nothing to be desired. 
We walked in on a later weekday evening without a reservation and were still given the choice to eat outside or in. 
Both areas are decorated sumptuously, but with such great weather you can&#39;t beat the outside dining area. 
Among the dishes we shared the standouts would be the salmon, diver scallops, and amazing dessert which was the honey lavender and truly shouldn&#39;t be missed. The drinks were strong and also very good. 
The only starter we ordered, which was the blue crab left only a minor disappointment. This was rather flat and tasteless. 
Will definitely come again when I&#39;m in this area, the food along with the price point as well as ambience is spot on. The dessert more than made up for the lackluster starter."

Our server was excellent at knowing when to check in on us and when to leave us alone. Overall, the food was excellent. Our appetizers included the grilled octopus, steamed mussels, and leek bruschetta. All delicious. I had a very nice margarita as well as the roasted beets salad which was wonderful - very light and refreshing. My entrée was the Australian Rack of Lamb - OH. MY. GODS. The lamb was perfect - so juicy, flavorful, and just the right amount. The dish came with potatoes which were the next best part. Also, pureed carrots which looked mostly like a smear of orange paste on the plate and didn&#39;t sit quite right on my taste buds. Almost too smooth, maybe? Too sweet? The weakest link for me was dessert. I ordered the lemon meringue cheesecake and it was still a little frozen in the middle (the edges were very tasty). By then we were wrapping up so I didn&#39;t have time to linger and let it melt. 

I would definitely recommend it for personal or business dining. If I lived nearby, I&#39;d keep it on my list for nice places to have dinner."

It is nestled in a little cookie cutter outdoor mall. So, the outdoor atmosphere and location leave a bit to be desired for my taste. But, the food was solid and this is a good option if you&#39;re in the area!

We chose from a pre-fixed special event menu for the shower. We started with a pretty basic salad and bread with dressing that was on the sweet side. Nothing impressive there. The main dishes were a mushroom ravioli, salmon, and chicken. The ravioli had good flavor, but the sauce was a little watery and washed some of the toppings and goodies off of the bite. The salmon was cooked very well. Nice and crispy on the outside, but juicy and not overdone on the inside. It was accompanied with some asparagus and potatoes. They were solid, but nothing special. The deserts were little mini cheesecakes, cookies, and carrot cakes. Those were also just what you&#39;d expect. The carrot cake stood out for it&#39;s moistness!

Again, nothing to write home about. I wouldn&#39;t drive from the city just to go there, but if I was in the area shopping or lived nearby and was hosting a special event, I&#39;d go with them!"

We sat at a very comfortable round table in the bar area and were tended to by excellent servers.  

I&#39;ve always enjoyed the ambiance at Topaz and it&#39;s that and the service that rates most of the stars in my review.  I&#39;m usually underwhelmed by the food - on this evening I tried one of the fish specials on the menu and it was flavorless.  I&#39;m either ordering the wrong thing or my expectations are too high because everyone else at our table raved about their choices.  

I&#39;ve been to Topaz&#39; sister restaurant (Amber) in Westmont and I think the food is much better at that location but if you&#39;re in the area it is one of the better dining options."

We couldn&#39;t get a babysitter so we also took our 10 month old son with us. They were so nice and accommodating for a nicer restaurant with a child. Our waitress was Cindy and she was amazing with our son. I was nervous walking in that this was way too nice of a place for a child but everyone from the hostesses to our waitress made us feel welcome.  Cindy even offered to hold Matthew (our son) while we finished our meals since he was getting a little annoyed sitting so long lol. I had the scallops and my husband had the salmon, both of which were excellent. We will definitely go back, without the child next time haha."

This place is pretty classy with really nice decor, their menu selection was really interesting and had a large variety of appetizers, entrees, desserts. The service was extremely friendly, and the server kept coming back often to check up on us. 

I ordered a carribean sunset cocktail and it was quite good, had an adequate tropical taste to it. I also got the bison steak, which was a little disappointing because even though I ordered medium rare, it ended up cooked more than the medium level. It was also quite chewy and the vegetables that came along with it had inconsistent seasoning, some parts were extremely salty. Furthermore, some of my friends got salad with bacon chunks, which is another story in itself, but in short it seemed there was confusion in the kitchen.

Overall, since I went with a large group, the verdict was some of the entrees were good, and some weren&#39;t. But if you want a decent classy place to chill with your friends at, it&#39;s worth a shot."

The service is very friendly and attentive, with the manager/owner frequently stopping at our table to check in. Complimentary moscato was a nice touch. However, food wise, we had a somewhat inconsistent meal.

To start, we had the grilled octopus and the crab cake. The octopus was not grilled long enough, however, we enjoyed the crab cake. It&#39;s one of the better crab cakes I&#39;ve had at restaurants. We also ordered salads. I had the Caesar salad, which was horribly overdressed. The romaine was just drowning in dressing, which basically made it inedible. Some of the croutons were pretty stale, also unpleasant. I did like how generous they were with the Parmesan, but I couldn&#39;t finish the salad due to the dressing issue.

Entrees were hit or miss. I had the special pork shank, which was very good. They were out of duck confit for the ricotta gnocchi, but the beef short ribs made a nice substitute and the dish overall was good. The chicken liver entree was also delicious. We had a problem with the seared scallops, as they did not taste fresh. The owner quickly removed this from our tab and allowed us to order the Scottish salmon instead, though we were charged for the salmon. Luckily, the salmon was actually quite good! It was cooked just right, pink in the center, and being Scottish, was very rich and fresh tasting. A great replacement! We also shared the lobster mac and cheese and brussel sprouts. Brussels were good, maybe a bit too charred, and the mac and cheese had a very generous portion of lobster. Pasta itself, just okay.

For dessert, we shared the beignets and the chocolate lava cake. The lava cake was pretty good, but the beignets were too dense for beignets. Not airy in the middle like they should be, and this made them quite hard and difficult to eat. Slightly disappointing, but aside from the texture, they tasted alright.

Overall, Topaz has a great dining atmosphere and good service, but is inconsistent when it comes to food. We&#39;ve had many Christmas Eve dinners here, and will probably be back at some point."

We walked over to Topaz because there was well over an hour wait at Coopers Hawk.  (By the way, I highly recommend Coopers Hawk).  Topaz is a nice place; we sat in the bar area, and the restaurant was quite empty.  We ordered a couple of appetizers off of the bar menu and our main courses came out cold.  I mean, freezing cold!  Seriously?  And again, there was hardly anyone there!  Why the cold food?  And quite honestly, the meals were mediocre at best.  We had a burger, some tilapia tacos, and artichoke dip that was nothing to write home about.  Oh, and I shouldn&#39;t forget the ice cold french fries.  
The only good thing was that out server was quite nice, and very accommodating.  That&#39;s the only reason I&#39;ll give this place two stars instead of just one.
Forget this place!!!"

It&#39;s sort of a strange layout-very modular, with several &#34;back rooms&#34; that would be better served as private dinner areas.  On a Friday night, when we were sat in a room off of the main dining room, it felt like we were in the &#34;wrong&#34; room. 
While the food was good with a nice selection of high quality American fare, the service was poor, with our server leaving us for long periods of time before we ordered, and blatantly trying to upsell in a way that was uncomfortable."

Was here with a good friend of mine after we had not seen each in over a year.  New baby for her and career change for me, we were ready to dress up like old times and treat ourselves to a nice dinner somewhere.  Well, did we hit the spot with Topaz!  It was even better than we expected.

The Good:  Both of us live in the suburbs.  Although we like exploring restaurants in the city, we don&#39;t always want to drive into the city.  With Topaz, you get the best of both worlds... city class dining right here in the suburbs!  For real.  (And if you come early enough, you may even have some time to check out the great shops nearby...)  The menu is inventive and offers choices for all different palates and eating regimes.  From the wine list, the server gave many suggestions for bottles based on our preference.  We ended up choosing a very well priced bottle of French wine which was perfect for our summer evening on the patio.  For specials, although the cold vanilla corn soup sounded divine, we couldn&#39;t pass up the chilled seafood appetizer of jumbo shrimp, lobster, and oysters accompanied with an excellent champagne vinaigrette.  Bread service is offered here, too!  The multi-grain bread deserves accolades itself and it&#39;s great not having the temptation to fill up on bread like at most places with their run-of-the-mill impersonal and often wasteful bread basket.  For our entree, we ordered the Lake Superior whitefish which came with toasted Sardinian couscous and mushrooms in a lemon buerre blanc sauce.  I appreciate that the kitchen split the dish for us maintaining beautiful presentation and giving both of us a sizable portion.  Everything tasted exquisite, and I would come back just to have the whitefish again.

The Bad:  No complaints here!  Everything was fantastic.

The Exceptional:  Have you seen this patio?  Wow!  I wasn&#39;t sure if I was in Napa or Miami Beach or perhaps even Tuscany.  We had a reservation for 7:45PM.  When we got here all the outdoor tables were full, but since it was our lucky day, one opened up just as we were about to settle in at the bar and wait for one.  From the outdoor fire pits to the lovely intimate lounges, the patio is by far one of the best ones I have ever been to in all my travels.  Although the interior is quite lovely itself, if you have the chance and the weather permits, I would recommend having a seat outside.  Even if you have to wait, the bar area is pretty swank too (both inside and out).  Or, if you want to just come for a light bite and drink after work, this would be a good place for that too.  They have great high-top tables near the bar that are open first come, first served.  There were a couple still open when we arrived on a bustling Saturday night.  Not to be overlooked, the service was also extraordinary.  From the friendly and helpful hosts to the multiple servers, you can see that this team works well together to ensure a fine dining experience.  Even the owner (manager?) stopped by our table to see if everything was to our liking!  We were definitely treated like royalty here.

Truly cannot wait to make a return visit to Topaz!  So fortunate to have this great restaurant so close to home.  I may not move to the city after all.  ;)"

On Saturday night, my parents hosted an anniversary dinner for my brother and sister-in-law and we received a few tables in the back room.  We had a prix-fix menu that my parents put together.

During cocktail hour, there were a few items passed around:  chicken satay and brushetta.  I only had the chicken but it was cold, dry and extremely bland.  The peanut sauce was rather blah, too.

For my meal, I had the:

Beet Salad:  this was my favorite, although, it&#39;s difficult to screw up fresh beets, goat cheese, arugula and walnuts.

Whitefish with Couscous:  This was a nice, light entree, but nothing special.  For the price point, I would expect more creativity and flavor.

Chocolate Lava Cake:  This wasn&#39;t bad, but it wasn&#39;t amazing, either.  I usually love anything and everything chocolate, but the individual cakes we each received were extremely dense and not as warm and gooey as I would like.  The worst was the coffee ice cream.  NOTE:  Always serve with vanilla, as everyone doesn&#39;t enjoy coffee.

The wines my parents selected were great and the staff was lovely, but the food leaves so much more to be desired.  For the price point, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll return for mediocre again."

So why the 2 stars?  OK, I&#39;m spoiled.  When I go to a restaurant in Illinois, I expect it to be smoke-free.  I like to taste my food and not someone&#39;s second-hand crap.  True we were sitting in the outdoor patio, but legally an outdoor smoking area has to be designated as such and this wasn&#39;t.  So when all four diners at a table close to us lit up,  we complained to the waiter.  The waiter then claimed that he spoke to the manager but nothing was done about it and no one told them to stop.  It ruined the end of our meal.  

Bad management and bad policy.  I&#39;m sad, but I don&#39;t think I will return."

Service spot on food to die for  ! Owner was present made it a point to make our experience perfect. I can not wait to go back and for sure will be recommended to all my food snobs! !!

Can&#39;t go wrong with any of the salads. One of my go-tos would have to be the BBQ salad. I love all the soups...especially when they feature the beer cheese!! Well and dessert is a MUST!

Wine list is amazing lots of good bubbles! Great Sauvignon Blancs like Cloudy Bay and Cape Mentelle. I also love a glass of Ferrari Carano Cab! 

If you have tried Topaz I would also recommend going to the sister restaurant Amber in Westmont. I had a delicious meal there as well. Still trying to find time to visit Dolce Pizzeria another sister restaurant!"

I would suggest removing &#34;Cafe&#34; from the title which makes it sound too casual. My date had the chicken madiera which was a bit dry, but a large portion. I tried the Mahi (special) which our wonderful server failed to mention was fit for the children&#39;s menu. Pricing of wine and martinis was surprisingly reasonable. Go to the bar for a post-dinner drink to watch middle-aged divorced Burr Ridge types make asses of themselves. Good times!"

I had visited previously only to have drinks on their stunning patio, but recently was able to enjoy a lovely meal on that same patio. Price is higher, portions are not oversized, this is fine American cuisine- so visit Topaz with that in mind. 

There was some push back from asking to be seated on the patio without a reservation, but I can play &#34;chicken&#34; with the best of &#39;em, and just waited out the Hostesses&#39; attitude thinking she was giving me box seats to see Cabaret with Liza on opening night. We were asked to wait 5-7 minutes, enjoying a drink in the bar area (5-7 minutes? I LOVE the Suburbs!). 

The outside patio also has a nice bar, and even a little seated area with an open flame, and would be a nice place to unwind after seeing Liza on opening night, but I digress. While Topaz is a swanky place, their wine list could stand to be improved. Still, my affordable Zinfandel was excellent. Having the sommelier add more variety of wines by the glass would be much appreciated, though.

Service at the bar and from our waitstaff was great! The gentlemen that bring around the bread basket with three kinds of bread for you to choose, the ones clearing our plates but politely asking if you are finished, the one bringing the dessert and setting it in front of you as if you were the Duke of Windsor? Very respectful and professional service here! Our waiter was a bit more easy-breezy, but I don&#39;t mind him being a little more &#34;hands off&#34; since he was always on point when we needed him.

Many interesting options on the menu! This is fine dining, so don&#39;t expect huge portions here. (If you want that in Burr Ridge, Capri Ristorante is just around the corner!)

Appetizer- Beef Carpaccio with pickled red onions and manchego sounded heavenly. But we went with the gnocchi with wild mushrooms, Italian sausage, and peas in a light parmesan broth. Super!

Entree- For my main course I really wanted to try the Filet, but went with the Spare Ribs. The beef was fall off the bone tender and served in a parsnip puree reminiscent of light mashed potatoes, with an apple-peppercorn sauce. The portion was just right and everything was very flavorful.

The Amber Whitefish on couscous in a lemon buerre blanc and the fish was more meaty than I expected, but cooked perfectly!

Dessert- Had the Sweet Bread Pudding, it was topped with a nice chocolate gelato, and served with candied powdered walnuts with white raisins. A nice break from redundant chocolate lava cakes!

I would not hesitate to return to Topaz for a drink or dinner. Well, it may take saving a few more Pounds to be able to enjoy being treated like a Duke again, but Topaz is well worth the sacrifice."

I consider it the best upscale restaurant in Burr Ridge/western suburbs.  My husbands favorite, he is a Bronco Fan- the manager
Fantastic wine choices, atmosphere and service.  I find sometimes some of the food does not deliver but in the last year it has become more consistent.  Never the quality or freshness just the combinations. My husband is always happy here. They will even put together a cheese plate if you do not want desert."

I was dying to try this place  and since it was a &#34;work&#34; dinner and free I picked it.  I expected the hefty price tag but I wasn&#39;t paying so I was OK with that.  The waiter was pretty good.  They bring a platter of 2 types of bread and offer you a slice which was very weird.  I am doing low carb so did not have any but the woman we were with seemed to be breaking a tooth trying to bit into it and finally just left it.  

To start, I had the wedge salad with Chipotle Ranch dressing instead of Blue Cheese.  The dressing was fantastic and had a bit of a kick to it, but the lettuce was noticeably turning and almost looked like they were trying to hide it with the dressing.  I ate about half and was grossed out.  My husband seemed to love his Ceasar Salad and the woman we were with loved her Roasted Beet Salad.  

I had the Lake Superior Whitefish toasted &#34;Sardinian cous cous - tomatoes - spinach
roasted mushrooms - lemon buerre blanc&#34; for my entree.  As other reviewers have written, the portions are incredibly small.  And I mean really, really tiny.  The &#34;whitefish&#34; had wayyyy too much brown on it once I removed the skin and if it was not a work dinner I would have sent it back.  The &#34;roasted&#34; mushrooms were not roasted.  They were Oyster Mushrooms and were, quite frankly, slimey and gooey.  The Coos Coos was OK but the Lemon Buerre Blanc was not there.  Simply missing I think.

My husband had the Pan Seared Alaskan Halibut which was missing (again...just not there) the asparagus.  Really?  The woman we were with had the lamb and seemed to like it well enough.

Then, the final nail in the &#34;Tammy is never going there again&#34; coffin.  Desert!!  In my humble opinion, a creme brulee is either good or not good.  However, this was terrible and did not resemble creme brulee at all.  It was sickly sweet and watery.  Honestly it tasted more like runny icing my sister made when she was in high school Home Ec class.  The woman we were with had the lemon sorbet and said it wasn&#39;t lemony.  

Very unfortunate dining experience that I will not be repeating which is a shame because it is so close and had the potential to be soo good.  

One more thing.  The atmosphere is very nice except the music choice is kind of bizarre and the bathrooms look like they belong in a high school gym."

The bay scallops were really very good, soft, cooked very precisely, and full of flavor. The chocolate crepe dessert was good as well - in fact a bit oversized, a friend and I were able to share it easily. Service is excellent, attentive staff that did a very good job at setting, clearing and bringing the next course. Our party of five had all good entrees, all fish on a Friday."

Our server was knowledgeable and attentive. 

At the recommendation of our server we ordered calamari, the pate of the day, and shrimp and grits. At my last visit the calamari was tough. This time it was perfectly cooked and tender. The shrimp and grits were incredible. The pate was a bacon pate. It was interesting.

For dinner I ordered the hanger steak with a side of pan fried brussels sprouts. It was excellent. My dinner companions were equally pleased with their entrees.

For dessert, on our server&#39;s recommendation, we ordered bread pudding, chocolate crepes, molten lava cake and a creme tart. Each was good. The bread pudding and chocolate lava cake were incredible.

This time I steered clear of the specialty martini menu. The Sapphire martini was very good.

I will definitely go back."

Had the Scottish Salmon.  Cooked perfectly, and I really liked the parsnip puree as a setting - good root veggie heartiness with a hint of sweetness that complemented the salmon and the apple beurre blanc very well.  

Had a side of sauteed spinach.  I love spinach.  It is simple to prepare but some restaurants manage to ruin it anyway.  Topaz did it just right.  Great compliment to the salmon.

Fried calamari appetizer was as well done as I&#39;ve had this tried-and-true anywhere, the aioli was fresh and flavor-lifting. 

Service was friendly and low-key.   A good find!"

But before you judge the book by its nice cover, let me advise you about the food. 
The service definitely detracts from the experience. 
The service is slow and unreliable. 
The food is decent but definitely not memorable. 
The mojito was flat and bland.
For the price, you will likely be disappointed. 
I really wanted to like this place, but left unsatisfied. If the service and food where better, they have a lot of potential."

They still run the three course lunch for under $20 with plenty of yummy choices.

I went on my own twice and then with the husband once since the last review.  Both times on my own, service and food was excellent.  It is a bit of a slower pace, but I don&#39;t realize this or mind it at all - until the husband, who likes to eat as if he is a competitive eater, was there.  I usually have a sandwich or salad - they had a clam po boy which was yummy and I love the lobster salad with brioche.  Their menu tends towards the spicier side, so daily soups often are a chili or tortilla chicken or black bean offering.  I love their by the glass wine list and the blended white (some Oregon vineyard I do not recall) is the perfect match to my seafood selections.  I am not a huge fan of the homemade chips, but that is good for my overall calorie intake, so I don&#39;t substitute them.

The husband would probably rate them at 2.5 stars as they mixed up his order - gave him chips instead of fries and took forever to take his order and get him some bread (we were there around 1 and he gets cranky if he doesn&#39;t eat by 12:30, so I was on borrowed time as it was).

I&#39;ll still keep coming after Kohler appointments and maybe by the next update I can get him to go for dinner."

We were able to enjoy their patio seating; there was a bit of a chill in the air but that was well negated by the strategic use of unobtrusive heat lamps.  The food was outstanding.  Steamed mussel appetizers were not heavy and set the palate well for our main dishes of Lake Superior White Fish and Australian Lamb Chops - both of which were cooked to perfection.  Our side dish of charred corn was big enough for two and provided a nice counterpoint to the entrees.  We went with a shared dessert of beignets with fudge - the beignets are vanilla filled and a little more stubby than the New Orleans style, but were very tasty.  Cappuccino was good; my only disappointment was the brewed coffee, which was weak (for decaf).  Overall, we enjoyed ourselves a great deal and plan to return."

My wife and I went to lunch, the service was fair at best... The waiter was sort of abrupt... No small talk...just give me your order.  A bread platter is not dropped off at your table, a waiter comes around and offers you SLICES of bread... I didn&#39;t want to seem like a pig, so I only took 2... But I would have liked more.  I could live with all that, but the food was not good at all.  I was surprised about that after reading all the good reviews about the food.  I ordered the 6 oz ribeye steak.  I expected it to be small... That wouldn&#39;t bother me... It was the fact that it was 1/4 inch thick AT BEST!  I&#39;ve seen thicker slices of ham.  It came with some type of dark brown gravy on top and some potato wedges NOT GOOD AT ALL.     My wife had the salmon BLT.  Also not to good.  The salmon was dry and tasteless."

It was a nice place to have a party.  The room is nice and quiet.  The service was attentive.  The menu was preselected but the food was still generally good.  The mushroom risotto was too heavily seasoned with white pepper and, dare-I-say ... MSG?  The white bean with ham soup was also a bit heavily seasoned.  The whitefish was outstanding, perfectly cooked and properly seasoned ... really delicious.  Our dessert sampler was just ok but I didn&#39;t have any choice in that one."

The tomato/watermelon soup was an interesting cold soup appetizer.  I ordered the scallops, which were a little over salted in the broth.  My husband ordered the special fish, swordfish, which he said was excellent.  Our friends ordered the pork chop and the hoison flavored salmon.  Everything was delicious.

However, what kind of put a &#34;dent&#34; into our dining experience was we ate outdoors and we were eaten alive by the mosquitos! We actually took the check early and went indoors to the bar to finish with dessert and after dinner drinks.

So, I guess I would not recommend outdoor dining in August, especially after all the rain Chicago has had this summer. However, the
food at Topaz has remained consistent."

The decor, ambiance and staff started the experience off perfectly from the moment you walk in the door.  I&#39;ll admit, like others on here, the wine list is lacking quite a bit of variety... however if you like Pino Noir, there&#39;s a large selection.  They had their timing perfectly between each course, allowing the guests time to eat at their own pace and you received your next course within 8 minutes of finishing your last. The Ahi Tuna appetizer was to die for... perfectly portioned and melted in my mouth.  I took our servers recommendation and got the Chestnut Bisque soup for the next course... &#34;it rocks&#34; as the waitress put it, and I couldn&#39;t agree more... perfectly seasoned.  The Pan Seared Scallops w/Oregon Mushrooms was incredibly flavorful, however the scallops were a bit overcooked.  For dessert, I had the Trio sorbet... the perfect end to a magnificent dinner.  I&#39;ve noticed majority of what we had is not available on their regular menu...

Don&#39;t get me wrong, on the surface it looked like my waiter did a great job - he asked me how the meal was every so often and he smiled.  But he did it almost like a California roll at a stop sign... as he walked by, slowed down just enough to ask how everything was, receive a response, smile, and then move on.  The only time he stayed at my table longer than 10 seconds was when he explained the specials and took my order.

With that said, I took his recommendations and ordered the Tuna Tartare and Dry Aged Bone-In Ribeye.  The tuna tartare was good, but not memorable.  There was some kind of cream mixed in that made it a bit heavy and overpowered the seasoning.  The ribeye was a disappointment.  A dry aged prime ribeye should be firm yet tender, with lots of flavor and needing very minimal seasoning.  Instead I got a squishy steak with a heavily seasoned sauce that would typically be paired with a grocery store steak.  That and piled with a large amount of limp vegetables.  I tried to salvage the steak by eating the part closest to the bone (with the most flavor), but couldn&#39;t, because the steak knife was as sharp as a butter knife.  Very frustrating meal overall.

I typically order desert, but just two dishes and one glass of wine in, I was already over $60.  Plus everything up to that point had been mediocre at best and I didn&#39;t want to disappoint myself again.

For those on travel and staying at the nearby Marriott Burr Ridge, I highly recommend the neighboring restaurants of Capri and Cooper&#39;s Hawk instead.  You&#39;ll get a better ambience, better service, and an overall more enjoyable meal for your money."

We sat down to eat and our waiter was like are you ready? I was like holly hell way to be rude! So we ordered our drinks and I actually had to flag down another waiter to take our order as ours didn&#39;t have a clue as to what he was doing.

At first we sat at the bar.  We decided it was cosmo night.  They came to us bright red and tasted like pure cranberry juice.  After sending them back 3 times, they finally got it right and actually put in a decent amount of vodka in there. 

After a few drinks at the bar we moved to the dining room where things actually got worse.  First off it&#39;s very pricey, but that is expected in Burr Ridge.  However the portions on all our meals were so small it was unbelievable.  We all left there hungry.

We ordered the Scallops with mushroom risotto and a filet mignon and they were both outstanding!  This entire dinner from start to end was absolutely delicious!  We also decided to try the lobster mac and cheese and brussel sprouts, which we never choose on a typical dinner menu, and they were outstanding!  Both cooked perfectly and very flavorful!

The atmosphere was well lit, and the wait staff was very detail oriented and punctual!  We also loved the wine selections that we were served!  Overall, I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone!

Oh yeah, we also had the carrot cake which was put together very uniquely with some fried carrots placed on top which was a great twist on the traditional carrot cake.  I loved it!  And our waitress, Cindy was perfect!  Over all an A+++"

The owner of Amber in Westmont brings another gem to show off.  Topaz is a beautiful restaurant whose interior competes with any restaurant in Chicago.   No expense was spared to create a hip but inviting environment.  

The food is lovely.  The menu is New American.  I had the crab cake to start followed by Halibut.  My dining companions enjoyed cauliflower curry soup, calves liver and filet mignon.  Everything was cooked perfectly and the service was surprisingly good for such a new restaurant.

They need to spend a little time refining their wine list.  It&#39;s not as extensive or exclusive as you would expect considering the food quality.  I&#39;ll definitely be back.

Edited to add....

I called them to inquire about corkage.  Unfortunately, they don&#39;t allow you to bring your own wine.  That&#39;s a real shame since their wine list is so weak."

Appetizers was a satay chicken and bruschetta, both bite sized and tasty.
Salad greens was light and just enough of a bite or two.
Entrees served we had the filet and the salmon.. WOW!  both absolutely delicious.  Melted in your mouth like butter and left me wanting more.  Would go back just for these entrees again, however.... a little pricey if we were to have paid for it.
Not your average restaurant and certainly not for your average budget.  A special occasion most definately if you dont want the drive downtown.
Ambiance was nice as was decor.
Everything Id give a 5* expect for the prices, hence my 4* rating."

We were ready to order our food by the time he came back. I asked some suggestions and went with it. Finally our dinner came, well most of it.. we were waiting for our side dish..augratin potatoes. We watch as the waiter went into the kitchen and started yelling at staff. When done with our meal, the potatoes finally came. Our potatoes were loaded with salt, now I like salt, but this was an accident. The chicken had no flavor, and nothing was worth coming back for. I live less than 2 miles away and was excited to see we have a nice new resturaunt. I guess not.

The interior is beautifully decorated but if you are going to pay those prices then you&#39;d be better off going downtown Chicago and getting a meal that actually tastes good.

I was there visiting my sister and she wanted to show me this other custard place. &#34;Other&#34; meaning the direct competition to Ted Drews which she had taken me to in St Louis.

I love custards! It&#39;s SOOO smooth and delicious!

Since that day any visit is not complete without a stop at Andys! I nearly fell out of my chair when I saw this was in Bollingbrook!

It&#39;s the real deal! Same delicious taste they&#39;ve been serving in Missouri for years!

So lucky to have them move into the area!

When we pulled in the line was so long we barely made it in the parking lot but they were  FAST! It took less than 2 minutes to get our order at the walk up window and the line we saw was cut in half by the time we walked back to our car which was maybe 5 mins.

So don&#39;t be discouraged if you see a massive line at the drive through! It will move quick and even if it didn&#39;t, it would still be worth the wait!!"

Was it good?  Yes...high butter fat mouth feel.  We also got the buy one quart of yogurt get one free for under five bucks.  

My impression is Andy&#39;s is good, but not worth the drive.  Since we live in Aurora, we can get custard just as good for less drive and money at Banana Split.

It&#39;s pretty cool they bottled cream soda in case you&#39;re getting a split or something small like a single scoop cone.

Definitely helped to move the crowd along.

I got my husband a peach Concrete (which he didn&#39;t even eat, WHAT THE HELL) and I got a Triple Chocolate Concrete with caramel Jackhammer. I don&#39;t suggest this if you&#39;re on a diet or feel that your body is a temple. My only gripe is the custard melts too quickly, but honestly that&#39;s more chemistry than anything.

The jackhammers are great (just like a blizzard) and the hot fudge sundae is my FAV!!! there is usually always a long line in the drive thru (and outside) but it goes by pretty quick. They also usually have someone taking orders before you reach the window (at the drive thru) which really helps.

I&#39;ve been coming here for a few years now and there is nothing better than frozen custard. I&#39;m pretty sure the only other place that does custard in the area is Culvers and that&#39;s nothing to write home about. 

I&#39;ll break down what I&#39;ve had from here. 

Most recently I tried the James Brownie Funky Jackhammer. Peanut butter brownies and hot fudge in vanilla custard. It didn&#39;t make it home for movie night. 

A few weeks ago I got a chocolate shake. Now I have a regular spot for chocolate shake cravings! Ladies...can I get an amen?

The thing that I&#39;ve ordered the most often has been the stolen brownie Sunday. If you like hot fudge Sundays with warm brownies in it, look no further. 

The place itself is a modern day retro feel...I guess that&#39;s the best way to put it! Seating is all outside and I brought my husky the last time I came and they gave her a sample cone with vanilla in it. She was definitely more than happy to make a mess in my back seat with it. We are currently working on not eating like the world is ending any second. ;)"

The only thing keeping me from ranking the place five stars is my displeasure with the drive through setup.  No intercom system, so you look at the menu and the order and pick up at the window.   Not only does this method of things slow things down slightly, when you are as forgetful as I am you forget your order before you make it to the window making things complex.  

I tried the butter pecan and it was the best conception of that flavor that I&#39;ve ever  tasted.  I kept having more even though I was quite full from an earlier meal and I only expected to take a couple of bites."

Obviously with Culvers around everywhere, I&#39;ve had frozen custard before but this place blew them out of the water. It was SO fresh (not to mention the sign that they made it fresh every hour). We just got the simple vanilla and chocolate scoops in a dish and we weren&#39;t disappointed. We wanted to try a lot of the other options available but since it was our first time we decided to keep it simple.

Even when it&#39;s the first frigid day of fall that has you wondering, &#34;is it winter already?,&#34; I&#39;m not going to say &#34;no&#34; to custard.  The pumpkin pie custard is the perfect dessert to say, &#34;I love fall, but I don&#39;t want to let go of summer.&#34;

Andy&#39;s takes a slice of pumpkin pie and mixes it with custard.  It&#39;s that simple, and it is as good as it sounds.  It&#39;s a seasonal flavor, so get there before it is gone!  In the summertime they serve a key lime pie concrete (same concept with the pie slice), and I&#39;m sad I missed it.  I&#39;m already looking forward to next summer.

This isn&#39;t a dine-in place.  There are two windows for orders:  a drive-thru and a walk-up.  The only seating available are several red benches on a patio area.  Or you can do it like me and sit in your car.  I mean, come on, I wasn&#39;t going to wait until I got home!

Walking up, I noticed a poster in the window advertising a chocolate covered strawberry sundae. &#34;Limited time&#34; &#34;Bolingbrook location only&#34; Limited time?!?! I&#39;m not even looking at the menu. I want what isn&#39;t going to be here next time!

I ask the counter boy for the chocolate covered strawberry sundae. He gives a look of confusion. I told him it was on the poster in the window. He yells out &#34;do any of you guys know about that poster?&#34; This confusion went on for a few minutes. I laughed inside so he wouldn&#39;t feel inept. 

This sundae was phenomenal! It was almost like magic shell chocolate on it but more milk chocolatey. The strawberries were fresh. The ice cream cold and creamy. I couldn&#39;t finish my sundae. It was half melted by the time I was done. I might consider sharing next time. 

PRO-TIP: The benches in front of the place are ridiculously uncomfortable. If you want to sit for very long, bring a seat cushion."

I&#39;m a Missouri girl so I&#39;ve been eating this stuff for many many years. Imagine my excitement when I learned they have Andy&#39;s in Chicagoland...... 

It&#39;s 8pm on Tuesday night. About 8° outside, which is a heatwave compared to the rest of the week. I guess with all this warm weather everyone had the same idea, lets get frozen custard! The drive-thru was busy so we braved the cold and went to the window. Now I ALWAYS get the Ozark turtle, because honestly, it doesn&#39;t get any better than that. Something made me step outside of my comfort zone last night and I tried the apple pie sundae. Who doesn&#39;t want apple pie and vanilla custard on top. I heard it&#39;s going away so I thought I would try it while it was still available. My other half ordered a medium Choc-O-Rocko.  

My treat was delightful. A piece of warm apple pie topped with vanilla custard, drizzled with caramel sauce and topped with pecans. So so good. It was super tasty, but the Ozark Turtle still hold my heart for my &#34;favorite.&#34; My boyfriends medium was huge and very chocolate. It was delicious but there is no way I could ever eat a big cup of that. It&#39;s super super rich. I guess If you&#39;re in need of some serious chocolate, this could fix you. He couldn&#39;t eat the whole cup. He loved it, be he wasn&#39;t expecting the medium cup to be that big. 

The staff was super friendly. I wish I got the gentleman&#39;s name who served us. He was a doll. I think I made him nervous when I asked about recommendations for  dinner in the area. I guess he could tell that I&#34;m serious about food.

I unearthed a crazy obsession with Andy&#39;s when my fam found the Bbook location when living out in the western burbs. It was amazing. I was in love. I honestly thought about an illicit wedding with their frozen custard machine.

And yes, this is coming from the girl who still HATES custard. 

So, a lot has happened since then. We moved to the south suburbs, added a new baby to the fam. In short, I haven&#39;t been there for awhile.

Yesterday, we pulled up, and I felt, well, a little nervous. Would it still be as amazing as I remembered it to be? Or was I just waxing poetic?

I nervously ordered a small thin mint concrete. That&#39;d be okay, right? Right?

One bite in, and it hit me: it was even BETTER than I remembered it to be. The thin mint concrete--while it will never replace my beloved cookie dough concrete--was amazing. The custard was as fresh as usual (if you didn&#39;t know, Andy&#39;s only serves custard that is less than 60 minutes out of their machines--seriously AMAZING quality!) and yeah, I&#39;m back to obsessively thinking about Bolingbrook.

I remember when this place was being constructed and my family and I would drive past it every weekend on the way to our summer house. Once it was an official establishment, it became a weekly staple.

This place has a really great selection of things, some of them are really unique or have fun names. I love their old fashion custard sodas. One of the BEST things at Andy&#39;s? The roasted pecans. They are absolutely exquisite. Seriously, get them-I&#39;m not even a big fan of nuts and I&#39;m raving about them. They work well around sweet treats. In the summer, I think they bring back their Key Lime Pie concrete :) I&#39;m hoping to get the pumpkin pie version in the fall!

I turned my counterpart on to this place. If there is ever an instance where my parents have us over to eat and we don&#39;t have a dessert, we run to Andy&#39;s and everyone gets their sweet treat.

The line can get preeeeetttttyyy long in the summertime (so glad this place is open year round). It&#39;s such a contrast going there when there are 5 inches of snow on the ground versus when it&#39;s 92 and sunny, it&#39;s still just as satisfying in either condition. It&#39;s generally pretty quick and it works portillo&#39;s style where someone comes up to your car and takes your order before you hit the drive-thru.

Happy ordering! (get those pecans)"

When I was little, my grandmother used to take me to a place in Hinsdale called &#34;Gables&#34; for custard on Saturday nights.  They closed about 35-40 years ago and since then I thought I&#39;d never be able to find a place that served frozen custard the way I remembered it tasting. When they built an Andy&#39;s in Bolingbrook, I knew I had to try it. It fulfilled every childhood memory I had about the way frozen custard should taste! I&#39;ve had everything on their menu from shakes to Sundaes to concretes and root beer floats.  It never ever disappoints with the richness and creaminess.

We were gratified to see that Andy&#39;s was open til 11:30 on week-ends (11 during the week), and offered a wide variety of frozen goodness to fulfill our jones, including concretes, sundaes, malts, floats, freezes, sodas, and more, all made with their frozen custard. They offer a variety of flavors in pints but apparently only vanilla and chocolate in person?

I&#39;d say they beat Culvers, the other custard place, with their variety (just desserts here, though, no burgers etc.) I enjoyed my butterscotch sundae: creamy vanilla custard offset with rich, toffee-like strings of butterscotch. My friend thought that her concrete was lacking in M&amp;Ms initially but then found more at the bottom, so all was well. 

We speculated as to what Andy&#39;s carbon footprint must be: they have a ton of insanely bright lights, and even standing under the fluorescent tubes for a few minutes to order at the window got toasty. While it makes them a landmark (hell, they&#39;re probably visible from space), it can&#39;t be very green. 

At any rate, Andy&#39;s will be a good option for those steamy summer nights when you&#39;re craving something sweet. In the meantime, you can always get a sneak peek, because custard cravings know no calendar."

My wife had a simple vanilla custard in a cone, and she said it reminded her of the high quality custard we had back in Buffalo, NY at a place called Anderson&#39;s.

I shared a Straw-Ana which is their custard topped with fresh slices of strawberries and bananas. This was absolutely delictable. The fruit was incredibly fresh and was paired perfectly with the custard.

One side of the building they have a traditional authentic style restaurant with tables for different size groups. On the other side they have a full bar, beautiful wood and lots of bad seats.

The carne asada tacos and chorizo tacos are my favorite. I always get fresh jalapeños added as well. There table salsa is very good as well as the chips and they have hot salsa on request.

Catering they have knocked our guests socks off twice now! Have them make you a taco bar for your next party. Tacos come already rolled meat and tortilla only and the rest of the topping come in very well sorted trays with rice and beans as well. 

The homemade guacamole is great as well, adding fresh jalapeños never hurts either.,

I would pass on this spot."

We came here for a light meal during the afternoon and the place was dead. We got the large guacamole (which is a LOT for only 2 people) and it was good. It was definitely fresh, but I wish they would add more cilantro, tomatoes, onion, etc to it.. it was mostly just avocado. The chips were a little less salty than I like, but still great.
I ordered a shrimp taco and the husband got a fish taco. We both ordered the homemade tortilla which is an additional $0.25 (seriously?). The fish taco was only okay. It tasted really fishy (moreso than it should have), but the shrimp taco was amazing. Fatty shrimps, great flavor in the chipotle sauce... excellent. I&#39;d definitely get one again.
The restaurant itself though was where it lost a star. We sat right next to the back and were bothered by flies the whole time. And when my husband ordered a &#34;lime&#34; margarita, he was brought a strawberry... waitress claimed they didn&#39;t have lime margaritas... only original. Huh? Original = lime, right? Anywho, margaritas were a tad pricey for what we got... but that shrimp taco and the mega serving of guac was definitely worth the stop."

Bachata and meringue music playing in the background of a dimly lit dining room, the perfectly seared carne asada with a cheesy enchilada served with rice and beans was accompanied by the Emmy taco of the most authentic Home Made Tortilla.

For those who want value and tasty food try this-Skip the dinners and buy a kick ass chili con queso appetizer and 2 tacos Mexican style Aka Chopped onions and cilantro. Shrimp or chili relleno are the best. Homemade corn tortillas are a treat if you like corn. Flour are my favorite all warm and chewy. Outstanding! This now leaves  you more money for the coldest beer in burr ridge. Modela Negra gets my vote.  I hope you enjoy this place as much as I do."

Compared to the other location in Brookfield, the food here is half as good with half the portions for half the price. Also, I ordered &#34;Chiles Rellenos&#34; (plural) and received one pepper for 19.00! Most Mexican restaurants serve two per and order or - as the Brookfield location does, at least call it Chiles Relleno! They KNOW better (as evidenced by the menu in Brookfield) and I found this an intentionally deceptive practice. Second, $19.00 for one pepper? I have eaten Mexican food all over the country and never paid such a ridiculous amount for so little. It was not good. The coating was very thick and oily and the sauce tasted &#34;tinny&#34;. The rice and beans were flavorless and the beans had a few hard, half-cooked beans in them. The guacamole was just LOADED with acid. Inedible. My waiter was a gem though. Sweet and patient, polite. 
Whoever is rating this place with these numbers must not be familiar with the amazing authentic Mexican food available here in the Chicago land area. Oh, and the hand-made tortillas are a treat as is the tamale. As I said, not bad but do not act like a fine-dining place when you are a one bathroom, rickety shack in a strip mall. In addition, be honest with the customers. 
I think people would change their reviews if they had ever eaten at the other location or most of the many other great Mexican restaurants in the near west suburbs."

I will begin by saying that I come here pretty frequently for lunch and occasionally for happy hour or dinner.  Their shrimp tacos, homemade tortillas and tamales are some of the best that I have ever had.  I understand that it is Cinco de Mayo and we expected that the place would be busy.  We were here last year and it was really not too packed, so we decided to give it a try.  To our surprise, there were plenty of open tables when we arrived.  Our drinks were good, our actual server was great and our food was good, as usual.  We did miss the shrimp tacos, but we understand that every year there is an overpriced, Cinco De Mayo special menu and those are not available.  Our server brought us boxes as soon as we finished our meal and then everything fell apart.  A woman came to our table, removed our dirty plates, our water glasses and napkins...including the napkin still under my dining companions arm all while muttering, &#34;I really need this table.&#34;  Right behind her another person approached our table and asked if they could get us a bag for our to go box or anything else while the woman came up from behind and again said &#34;I really need this table.&#34;  At this point, we notified them that if they wanted us to leave, as it was clear that they did, they should probably bring us our check so we could pay our bill.  They hurried away to get the bill and yet another server stopped by and told us that she would make sure we got our bill right away because again she really needed the table.  Within a matter of about 2 minutes 3 different people approached our table and told us 4 times that they needed us to leave so they could seat someone else at our table...BEFORE WE WERE EVEN PRESENTED WITH OUR BILL!  I worked as a hostess and server for many years and in my opinion at no point is it acceptable to push a paying customer out of a table because the one coming in the door is more important.  We were not lingering.  We spent a good deal of money on food and drinks which we had JUST finished.  I understand that it is probably their busiest night of the year and most of the time the place is pretty empty at lunch or dinner (notice how most of the reviews mention the place being empty), but I found being pushed out the door beyond offensive and do not plan to return.  The real kicker was when we left there were just a few people standing by the door.  I expected to see a line out the door and down the sidewalk all the way to Tuesday Morning by the way that they were acting.  You go to a Mexican restaurant on Cinco de Mayo, you expect to wait, at least I do, but what I do not expect is rude and inappropriate treatment.  This is incredibly disappointing."

The decor is cute and the place is small but pleasant inside.  

Obviously very understaffed and lacking the presence of a manger, we waited 15 minutes for menus; a table seated after us received menus and chips before us.  We should have left.

Staff seemed very overwhelmed and every table seemed to be waiting for something.  Lots of confusion in the air.  A couple of young guys trying hard to hold things together, they were nice.  Where was the manager?

Once we were able to order the food was good.  Even the chips and salsa were above average.  I like that they make tacos mexican style with onion and cilantro.

My husband loved his first margarita, the second one came out tasting odd.  Inconsistent...

Since the food was good I&#39;ll be returning to give them another shot.  It seems like management is bad."

Growing up in Pilsen and having awesome authentic food at home has made my expectations pretty high I guess. Living in Darien, I have to say that finding good Mexican food has become quite the quest. We have tried everywhere and were hoping La Cabanita was going to be our next spot. I gave it two stars because the place was very clean and the customer service was great! Unfortantely the food was just lacking. The guacamole was good but that was literally it. My tacos Al Pastor were over seasoned and the huge pineapple chunks were not a good touch. My boyfriends arrachera (skirt steak) was small and lacking flavor. The rice was mediocre at best. My sisters enchiladas tasted like the mole came out of a can and the homemade tortillas were very thick. After paying over $75 with tip we all felt pretty disappointed.

The meat quality is poor across the board.  The meat is also overcooked in just about every dish.  It&#39;s obvious they have containers of pre-cooked (boiled?) meat just sitting there all day long.  Seems like nothing is cooked to order (reheated and assembled to order is not the same thing).  

The salsas are decent, but the chips are terrible.  They are not fried in-house, they come out of a bag, and the chips we had tasted stale.  Poor way to start a meal.

Service is fine, but the servers clearly are not excited about the food.  They seem apathetic, like they&#39;re just going through the motions.  Not a very welcoming vibe.

All in all, well below average."

I&#39;m a burrito guy, so that is what I order every time. Super tasty! 

The salsas have quite a bit of flavor, but they aren&#39;t the hottest. Mexican cooking is different across the regions, just like in the US. Some regions eat spicy food, while others do not. If you wnat it spicier, you could always ask for jalapenos in your meal.

The bad: I visited with a group of 8 coworkers in December. The bill they handed us did not reflect a tip included. When I went to pay the bill with a credit card, they tried to sneak the tip by me (Shady! and less than the tip we already had set aside). Then they charged my credit card the wrong amount, recharged the correct account, and the refund for the duplicate amount has never come through. I have tried calling the manager many times, but he has refused to return my calls at the restaurant and his cell phone.

The restaurant is small, but clean and cozy.  There are fewer than 10 tables and only a couple were filled.   There was one server and she was also the bartender.
We each started with a margarita-sangria cocktail.  They were pretty tart and we would not have them again.
They gave us chips and salsa but we also ordered some guacomole. For the meal, one of us had the fish taco dinner on their homemade tortillas (an extra 25 cents), which was lightly breaded tilapia.  Another had a mix of chicken and beef tacos on homemade tortillas, prepared Mexican style which is with onions and cilantro.  I had a dinner with a beef flauta, a beef enchilada and a an American style hard beef taco, which is my standard test for a Mexican restaurant when I go the first time.  
We agreed that overall the food was 4.5 out of 5.0.  However there were a few minor issues with the service.  There were no napkins at the table and when we asked for them she brought cheap carry out napkins.  We just got up and took some nice cloth ones from a nearby table.  Also, the dinner comes with rice and beans, which can be refried or black beans.  They mixed up two of the orders on the choice of beans.

The positives: The service was good, the waitress was very attentive in bringing more chips and salsa, water and checking up on us now and then. The food was good, I had steak fajitas with rice and beans and it was tasty. 

The things they can work on: My main complaint is the size of the tables. The legs of the tables are very narrow, so for a big guy like me it&#39;s uncomfortable to sit there. I could barely squeeze my legs between them and scoot in to be close to my food. As we were eating an obese genteman walked in and believe me, I felt for him. I&#39;m not obese, just a big guy - I have no idea how that guy was able to sit at his table to eat. The only other complaint is the amount of corn tortillas I was given with my fajitas, three. That&#39;s it. They are small tortillas, Mexican style for tacos, which is fine, but I finished all three and could have had at least one more. I think four would have been a good number. 

Other than that, like I said, it was a good experience. I would come back here if i have the chance. The place is clean, the service is good and quick. If you want Mexican and you&#39;re in the area, I recommend it."

A fantastic new ownership takeover of a spuddering mexican restaurant in Burr Ridge.  Previously Capri Mex (Italian owners trying to do mexican) the new ownership has authenticated flavors and upgraded the menu offerings.   This is La Cabanita&#39;s second location, with the first in Brookfield (I have also been there.).  

My only complaint is that the portions could be larger for the price charged.  They certainly do not over fill the tacos and run their rice and beans portions slightly thin.  

For this restaurant to be a success, they need to give their customers a real value for their money, as so many people have been tainted by the previous owners. 

In summary, th food is great and I would be back more often if they either increased their portion size or slightly lowered the prices.  This restaurant is a major upgrade to the previously installed mexican restaurant."

The chips weren&#39;t my favorite, but the salsa made them better. Both times I ordered fajitas and they certainly came out sizzling... delicious! They also made the tortillas in-house -- a big plus in my book. Toward the end of our meal, the owner personally introduced himself and made sure the meals were to our liking. I asked why they didn&#39;t serve regular queso (like many Mexican restaurants do down south) and he told us it was because the Queso Fundido is so popular. I told him I had never tried Queso Fundido before, and within moments he brought an order of Queso Fundido out for us -- on the house.

when we got the check, i saw that the waitress charged us for a drink (which should have been included in the lunch box).  when i brought it to her attention, she looked confused and went to the menu to double check.  she came back saying that my husband didn&#39;t get the lunch box.  we tell her that he did (she charged 8.95 which is the price of the lunch box as opposed to 5.00 for 2 tacos) she then asked another server again and then apologized under her breath..  my husband then told the waitress that he never got his sides either, but that it&#39;s ok.  with attitude, she told us that the lunch box doesn&#39;t automatically come with the sides and that WE have to tell her what we want.  so i tell her that SHE should have also asked us what two sides we wanted.. but instead of agreeing, she started arguing saying that that&#39;s not the way they do it.  that we need to tell them first and she kept stressing that it doesn&#39;t come with automatically.

needless to say, we will NOT be coming back to this place...  no thanks to mediocre food and horrible service."

We love outdoor eating and their patio is just simply the best with a gently breeze when it&#39;s too hot elsewhere and of course a beautiful view of their wonderful golf course.

We have tried may different items on their menu and pretty much love them all. The prices are mostly very reasonable and in addition they have specials every single day - for instance a half priced burger as well as half priced beer on Mondays - a deal that&#39;s unbelievable. In addition they come up with new and different meals such as a most fantastic &#34;Wurstplatte&#34; for Oktoberfest  - a meal to die for if you like German food. 

Anyway we just love it there!"

This summer I found it necessary to make arrangements for a Bridal Shower, looooooooooooong before the date.  Since I was familiar with the facility I knew exactly what room I wanted and menu selection.  Everything was handled by phone so I had no worries as the date approached.
When setting up, you can get into the room one hour before scheduled start time.  Our server, Jean, was absolutely wonderful.  Food presentation was most appetizing and food was delicious.  I had a selection of cupcakes and they even made identification cards for each variety.  On a beautiful, late summer afternoon, we were able to go out onto the balcony area off of the room.  It was a wonderful way to end the shower.
Everyone left happy and with a full tummy."

First off, we sat down and waited close to 10 minutes just to get waters. Waiter didn&#39;t know how to sell us on beer or alcohol but he&#39;ll learn that down the road. Next the appetizer came and we had no plates nor silverware. I was appalled that I had to ask another server to help me out. The food runner didn&#39;t even realize we didn&#39;t even have any!!!!We ordered a dish with no jalapeños and it guess what, it came with japs! Server even took our paid bill before we even left... I though a good rule of thumb is to wait for the guest to leave. 

They have a young crew working there, I hope others get a better experience."

Although it did guide me to a friend&#39;s house in Arrowhead subdivision on many a dark and dreary day! The redo is lovely.  The course is public but greens are well maintained.  I would stay away on the weekends, way too busy.  I&#39;ve golfed here several times with girlfriends and we always enjoy ourselves.  Beverage carts are great.  Driving range is nice but often crowded as well.  Hey, it&#39;s a 27 hole course with a great clubhouse, good food at non-private club prices.  If you golf you could do much worse than Arrowhead!"

The golf course looks and feels very much like a real life country club yet at municipal course prices. It is a very nice course and very well maintained. The staff are very nice as well. If there is anything to complain about it is that the driving range could use some work. It is only mats which I would not like to play on if this was my regular course. It is also a very challenging course in its own right.

It wasn&#39;t very busy and there was no one at the host stand. I waited a total of 20 min before the host finally came back (after asking multiple wait staff for assistance) and he didn&#39;t even apologize for the wait. 

It took quite a while to order. Once we received our food, we were both out of water (they give tiny cups) and the waiter asked us how our food was and said he&#39;d be right back with water. 45 minutes later, he brings the water. I tried flagging him down the one or two times I saw him in between but he did not see me or stop by to check on us. He only had 3 tables... Then it took forever to get the check and box. Quite a terrible experience. We were probably there for 2 hours and it took us 10 min to eat our food.

We both got the rib eye sandwich which was okay. 

Never going back again."

We booked our wedding rehearsal dinner at Arrowhead in the Clock Tower Room. Alexis was very helpful throughout the planning process and very accommodating with decoration setup for our special day. The food was great and everyone really enjoyed themselves! The only point of confusion was around the timing of our open bar, which ended up costing us a bit more than expected, but they did make an attempt to resolve the issue. I highly recommend this venue for your next event, but would recommend triple checking the paperwork and confirm the plans to ensure everything goes as expected. We will be back for future events!"

They have a great cocktail room with attentive bartenders and delicious passed hors d&#39;oeuvres, which is such a fun intro to the wedding reception. The reception area is a great space with plenty of room for guest tables, a head table, hallways for photo booth stations, photo tables, guest books - you name it!

I&#39;ve only been to one ceremony here, but it was lovely. The bride and groom were supposed to get married outside at Arrowhead, but it was ungodly hot that day so they moved the ceremony inside which is a nice option to have. You never know what the Chicago weather will be like!

I&#39;ve been hearing great things about the restaurant and bar at Arrowhead Golf Club, so my husband and I will have to give those a try sometime!"

Stay away. The course staff are rude and surly. The starter also likes to watch your approach shot when you make the turn and heckle you. Also don&#39;t play here on Saturday, not only because the course doesn&#39;t justify the expense, but also because the grass is so long, you&#39;ll loose balls in the second cut. Long and narrow too, so don&#39;t tee with the driver. 

The resturaunt will also boast they are family friendly, but there isn&#39;t one chaning table in the whole place; I had to change my son in my car. When I brought this to the managers attention it was suggested I go to the men&#39;s locker room to change him.

If you don&#39;t head my advise and play here, go in the expectation you will be treated like an imbecile. If you come to eat, go knowing the food is good, but the service is slow. 

Also, Arrowhead apparently has money to burn. They are over staffed and it&#39;s been my observation there are always 2 or 3 wait staff busting their humps while others socialize."

They have it clearly marked right on their standard menu.  Mark this a place we can go and I don&#39;t feel like a pain!!!  The kale winter salad was certainly big enough for a full meal - packed with all the goodies they had promised.  Gluten free beer (Prairie Path by Two Brothers) is on hand and the buffalo wings were spicy yet very good.  My only complaint is our wings (our appetizer) came out with our meals.  As a patron it somehow makes you feel rushed, and that you have an over crowded table.  Everything was tasty - timing was just off in the kitchen.  Our waiter apologized and was very attentative.

The course is in great shape and the price is reasonable. They have 3 nine-hole courses, one of which I believe is used for people playing 9, but I guess it really depends on the day. I&#39;ve played all three and it&#39;s hard to say which is better. The fairways are in great shape and the rough is thick, but well maintained. The greens are challenging, but fair and will test your patience. This is one of the better public courses in the area and I suggest trying to play during the week.

My daughter and future son-in-law chose Arrowhead for their upcoming wedding.  We attended the tasting dinner and, obviously, the wedding. 

All I can say is, &#34;WOW!&#34;

The food was excellent.  They chose two entrees, stuffed chicken breast and a strip steak.  Both were excellent.  At the tasting dinner, we all commented that the wine sauce on the steak was a little too citrusy.  Their event coordinator said it was no problem. She would ask the chef to tone that down. When served at the wedding, it was, in fact, toned down and very good. More impressively, the steak was not over cooked, but nicely medium rare.  Very well executed. 

Everyone I talked to uniformly praised the quality of the cooking. 

More importantly, the staff was exceptional. Of course, the wedding party  table was served first, but it was really great how a swarm of servers were delivering plates at almost every table within mere minutes of the head table. None of that nonsense of the front of the room finishing their food, just as the rear of the room is getting their plates.

AND, the serving staff was incredible. Always nearby, but not overwhelming.  Regularly offering wine, water refills, and coffee and asking if there was something else they could do. Any request I heard was responded to promptly and with a smile, and fulfilled moments later. 

This is an incredibly run banquet facility managed by real pros. They wait staff is well trained and uniformly happy to please. 

I do not think you could go wrong."

They had their entire upstairs open and each room had a generous spread of appetizers.  My favorite display was their table of cascading tortilla chips surrounded by your favorite nacho toppings.  Mount Nacho!  Very creative! The event was classy, flavorful, and we discovered so many new breweries!  (New favorite: Off Color Brewing!)

Most recently, I was here for a bridal shower and we all agreed that Arrowhead made the event warm and welcoming for everyone attending.  We had the center room with a gorgeous view of the golf course.  The room comfortably sat 50 people and we could all easily see the bride throughout the afternoon.  The staff was incredibly attentive and made it so the hostesses could easily enjoy the shower too!

To eat, we enjoyed the following: 
Fresh Salad with Italian or Ranch Dressing - See my picture of this! They took plating to a whole new level!  It was almost too pretty to eat!
Champagne Chicken with Roasted Potatoes and Steamed Vegetables - The chicken was very tender and the sauce served with it was velvety smooth with a nice butter flavor.  The vegetables were tender crisp and very fresh.
For Dessert we enjoyed fresh fruit salad served in martini glasses - again, made for a great presentation.

I would highly recommend Arrowhead to any one looking for a venue for a party.  The service, food, and atmosphere are all exceptional.  I am thoroughly looking forward to a wedding that I will be attending here in the near future."

I was the first one there so I went to the bar.  I practically had to set myself on fire to get the bartender&#39;s attention!

I had made a reservation and we were seated in the bar and our server took our drink order. Then we waited. Our server showed up and dropped our drinks. No questions about ordering, nothing. We had several waves trying to catch her attention and finally stopped another server and asked him to tell her to come over to our table.

We ordered and waited again. Only part of our order was delivered and we had to point out that some was missing. After that, the two guys at the table next to us sucked up all her time.

But wait, it gets better! The place was packed with some singles group for &#34;advanced age&#34; people. Like REALLY advanced aged. I joked how they probably took a bus over from their assisted living facility. They went well with the band that actually played a sing by Seals and Crofts. Don&#39;t get me started on the dance moves I saw!

We were told that there were still 2 tables in front if us. 30 MINUTES LATER we were seated at the exact same table I had asked about. It sat vacant the entire time we were waiting. 

Then the food service wasn&#39;t much better. We waited a long time to have our order taken and even longer to get refills which we had to ask for twice. It took a really longtime to get basic condiments too. The mustard never came. Then we had to wait forever to pay our bill too.

I was in love with arrowhead for my wedding reception and was willing to book right away with them but asked to negotiate two minor things. They told me the prices were final because they will find someone who was willing to pay it and if I would like a discount I was &#34;more than welcome to choose an off season date.&#34; I will not be booking my reception with Arrowhead just because of the poor customer service. I was not treated like a special bride and I got the feeling that my special day wasn&#39;t going to be catered to me. Again, DO NOT EVEN LOOK at this venue if you want a staff that is flexible.

Club Nachos - A big plate of chips loaded with cheese topped with ground beef, lettuce and tomatoes served with a side of guacamole, salsa and sour cream.  2 thumbs up!

Death by Chocolate - This is the best way to die, IMO.  Three layer chocolate cake with a side of whip cream.

Friday Night Scene -  Older crowd - late 20&#39;s and up.  At first I thought it was karaoke night but it turned out there was a band playing outside. 

The service here is always good, kudos!

The place is gorgeous, and the views are spectacular.  The food was very good, the service was as well, and the prices were very reasonable.

I was here for a pretty focused work lunch, which probably is what is keeping me from having this as a 5, as I was not able to focus fully on the restaurant and the meal.  

I look forward to coming here again, and trying the Asian salad that a coworker of mine RAVE about.  I had a turkey sandwich, which was very solid.

Good:
This is definitely one of the better public courses in the the Chicagoland area and the course is well maintained.  The lack of dog legs make the course sometimes tedious but there are interesting and challenging holes. 4 stars 

Bad:
For the price point the food in the restaurant leaves a lot to be desired. 
Lots of families, corporate events, and men who think they are Tiger using the back tees has a tendency to slow down play. 2 stars 

Ugly:
Golf starters and a few in the pro-shop will make you feel like they are doing you a favor to play here.  To be fair most of the folks that work their are very customer focused but a few bad apples can easily cause this perception. 2 stars 

Management are you listening?
Clean up the menu &amp; food quality, let the starters know that they don&#39;t own the course, and speed up play."

We tried to hide our disappointment as we were led to a table inside the bar area. 

After we moved past the fact that we wouldn&#39;t be enjoying this lovely evening we ordered a few glasses of wine and took a look at the menu. I decided on the spicy veggie flatbread sandwich. I always have a taste for something spicy and this was marked as a new addition to the menu so I decided to give it a shot. Our food arrived shortly after we ordered but I was less than impressed with my sandwich. It was loaded with hummus and ricotta cheese with veggies far and few between. I couldn&#39;t even taste a hint of spice which was also a disappointment. 

Everyone else seemed to enjoy their meals and despite the indoor seating we had a great time catching up and the service was good. I had a bite of my friend&#39;s fish tacos and they were really tasty...I immediately had order envy!"

The style of the interior, the downstairs bar available to guests both pre- and post- reception, and to add to it all - the Service!!! 

Kristina and Jaci are beyond phenomenal. I was very much a hands-on, DIY bride, complete with millions of questions and favors I was asking about every single step of the year-long planning process. Every question was answered within 24 hours, or I was at least in communication with them, and they were letting me know when I should anticipate an answer. 

I loved that Arrowhead hosted a &#34;bridal expo&#34; for already scheduled wedding couples and two guests, about six months or so before the wedding. It helped you narrow down appetizers, deserts, wines and late night snack options. We didnt think when booking that having only one wedding per night was that big of a deal, but after attending a few other weddings, while still in the planning process for ours, we realized what a huge incentive it really is to have the main focus on your big day only. 

Highly, highly recommend!! Wouldn&#39;t hesitate to spend the money here again."

The ceremony was held under a white wooden trelis.  The wedding party walked down a red brick paved ailse.  Guests sat in simpley white wooden chairs.  It doesn&#39;t take much to make their new outdoor scene beautiful.

Not your typical wedding grub here, because it was actually delicious!  Passed hors d&#39;oeuvres of crab cakes, skewerzs of tomotoe, basil, and mozzarella.

Moving onto dinner:
creamy tomato bisque complete with thin ribbons of basil

mixed greens walnut salad with raspberry vinaigrette (my favorite vinaigrette of all time)

tender and juicy chicken breast stuffed with spinach and cheese, accompanied by well seasoned roasted potatoes and mixed veggies

Needless to say, i did not leave much room for dessert!

The servers were amazing.  Attentive.  Friendly.  And they even served us with white gloves.  Not too shabby!

We took advantage of their beautiful balcony overlooking the golf course as we, the girls attempted to rest our feet from dancing.  Gorgeous view.  If I hadn&#39;t known better, I would have thought that the entire club just opened recently.  This venue is spotless, beautiful, and elegant."

As soon as I arrived the staff was extremely friendly and helped us with all our needs. A waitress came up to me and told me that she had placed a pitcher of water for us at the DJ table and even as soon as my jazz band completed cocktail hour they had tasty food waiting for us. 

The venue has been newly remodeled and is remakably clean even in the kitchen. It boasts a gorgeous walk out balcony directly behind the head table to boot. Jamie &#34; a captain at the club&#34; ran the show very well and they had a few girls showing new brides the room prior to my start that were very accomidating.

Dinner was exceptional! I had an event in Lake forest the night before at the &#34;Armour House&#34; that I had DJ&#39;d along with my Classical Ceremony Quartet and the food was nothing compared to Arrowhead. I ate a perfecty cooked filet that melted in my mouth and can safley say that everyone at my table did as well.

All the staff was groomed clean and well dressed and not a glass was dropped the entire night. One more thing is they don&#39;t skimp out on the passed apps during cocktail hour either, they just keep coming with delicious scallops wrapped in bacon and then some. Good Job Arrowhead!

The BF and I came here last Monday after my Dad gave us a $50 GC for the restaurant that needed to be used before the upcoming expiration date. I wasn&#39;t quite sure what to think about din din at a country club at first. Like, would I have to look nice? Would there be any veggie options for me? Would it be snooty? 

Well, here are some answers to my Qs, in case you&#39;re wondering the same thing. 
No, you don&#39;t have to look nice. At least not &#39;country club nice&#39;. There were a few tables dressed &#39;business casual nice&#39; but for the most part, everyone else has a jeans and flannel shirt or hoodie... which 
I appreciate on a cold Monday night. The bar is nice though, it could totally be a dress up type place if there were more short tables and less bar tables... but I kind of like it as is. 

The veggie options were scarce but they existed. I got the spring rolls which were large and simply delectable. For dinner I got the Mediterranean Salad that had all the fixins&#39; you could ever want. It was a great big, hearty salad and everything tasted fresh and crisp. I would most defo recommend it for the copious amount of hearts of palm, kalamatta olives, feta cheese, cucumber, tomato, peppers, and red wine vinaigrette. 

They were not snooty at all. Our server was probably one of the best servers ever. He knew the menu and beers inside and out and was the pinnacle of professionalism. I asked him about the Arrowhead Ale and he recommended Two Brother&#39;s Cane and Ebel as a better selection... but since I was nursing a minor hangover from drinking too much Cane &amp; Ebel  the day before, I went with a different poison- Magic Hat #9. One thing worth mentioning, the tap prices here are dirt cheap! They have select $1 draft beers on Mondays and $5 burgers... and the beers that are not part of the select $1 draft special (Exp: Cane &amp; Ebel) are priced cheaper than they are at the actual brewery. I think I just found a new place to drink. 

For the meat lovers, the BF fell in love with their SSS appetizer. It&#39;s a Seared Sea Scallop with cajun spices and dijonnaise sauce. The soup was a spicy beef soup with peppers and he loved that also, though he was expecting it to be a little spicier.  And for dinner he got their signature burger, the Big Bertha. Big Bertha is not part of the $5 special mind you, it&#39;s actually a  3/4 lb, $15 Angus Beef burger with cheddar, caramelized onions, and bacon cooked INSIDE the burger patty and topped with arugula, tomato, and Bearnaise sauce on pretzel bun with fries and slaw. You might have a heart attack, but you&#39;ll die with a smile.

All in all, it was a fabulous experience and we will certainly be back. We ended up getting 4 craft brew pints,  2 appetizers, a soup, and 2 entrees for a total of $51.07... okay, we had the $50 GC so it was really only $1.07 but it was a steal either way."

Arrowhead is phenomenal. From the decor to the food and impeccable service, Arrowhead not only met but out-shined our already high expectations.  Many of my guests have approached me in the weeks since our wedding and said that their dinner at Arrowhead was the best they&#39;ve ever had at a wedding.  My father, who is a tough critic, couldn&#39;t stop talking about how quickly he would recommend Arrowhead to anyone getting married in the future. 

Furthermore, the year and a half between my engagement and the wedding was chalk full of emails to our catering manager, Kristina Nemetz. She always answered my emails promptly, quickly resolved questions or concerns that I had, and clearly never grew impatient of my many wedding-crazed requests. It is clear they truly do try to give every bride and groom the very best wedding possible. 

I am an admittedly type-A, detail-oriented woman, and everything about Arrowhead made it the perfect place for my wedding. I highly, highly recommend choosing them as your reception venue. You will NOT be disappointed!!!!"

If I can spare somebody else from tasting it, this review is a success.  

At my table, the A Burger was ordered, the Spicy Vegetable Flatbread Sandwich, and the All You Can Eat Fish and Chips special.  

The Fish and Chips had a lot of nice fish, but overall the meal was incredibly salty and greasy.

The A Burger was also salty and greasy, and the person who had it complained of a funny taste.  

The Spicy Vegetable Flatbread Sandwich was heavy, dry, greasy, salty, and somehow had less vegetables on it than the A Burger. At least that had some tomatoes, lettuce and onions on it.  It was a  heavy, biscuity flatbread, topped with tons of ricotta, mashed chickpeas, and tons of tiny papery fried onions bits.  It had a tiny bit of broccoli, cauliflower, and some red bits may have been peppers, but they all were greasy and they tasted like bagged frozen vegetables.  I also didn&#39;t detect anything that could be described as spicy.

We went there for food and the live band, but they didn&#39;t really play, they just stood around for a long time.  There also  wasn&#39;t any room or occasion for dancing, so we were all pretty disappointed."

It&#39;s a bit off the beaten path, so it&#39;s usually easy to get a table right away.  You can sit in the dining room (a bit on the fancy/ formal side), in the bar, or on the huge deck (in the summer).  The view is fantastic from the deck.  

The bar is lively, lots of sports action on tv&#39;s, and LIVE MUSIC every Thursday, Friday and Saturday night.  It&#39;s mostly acoustic guitar stuff, and most that I&#39;ve heard have been quite enjoyable.

The menu is very good.  I&#39;ve had several of the salads, and several appetizers.  The beef tenderloin sliders are fantastic.  They recently took the buffalo burger off the menu, and this is why I took away a star- that was my favorite thing to order there!  I like their other food too, but I miss the buffalo burger!

After months of searching when we came across this one we knew right away this was the place to throw our big night!!!

I worked with kristina the whole time and she has always been nothing but a pleasure to work with.  Great attitude and always helpful.  Just a pleasure.  The staff was wonderful, food was delicous and the evening at Arrownhead was perfect.  I got nothing but great reviews regarding the venue.  

The only thing that went wrong in the night was we had Ahi Tuna as a dish.  My husband and I tried this at the tasting and it was perrrrrrrfect.  And any fish lover would love it, but it was overcooked.  This was not the venue&#39;s fault by any means.  We went on overtime with taking pictures so they had to keep the food in the warmer, so we werent pleased that our dishes were swerved this way.  Although it was our fault Kristina went above and beyond to make it up to us.  More then she needed to, and we appreciate that so much.

My husband and I look forward visiting Arrowhead in the future for dinner at their restaurant.  The steak, Ahi Tuna and CHicken were superb.  

Arrowhead also has a yearly event they invite their brides and grooms to that serves all the embellisments that you might want to serve at your wedding.  We went with the mini sliders and nacho bar.  Also had the shrimp and mango sauce and other stuff too.  All yummy!!  So hard to choice from.  And if you wantt o go all out they even offer a firework display for like $6K.  TO uch for us to spend but nice as a option.

Drinks: so-so wine list, not impressive.. don&#39;t remember the beer list but I think they serve Two Brothers?

Also- we stayed at the bar after dinner and the food/bev manager chatted it up with us- nice guy!

Pros: the live music was very good, and the patio at sunset during the summer is nice

I suggest Arrowhead for happy hour with friends, or maybe a few drinks on the patio during the summer season"

Absolutely incredible spread of food in a beautiful setting.  Breakfast selections included an omelette station, excellent scrambled eggs, incredible hashbrowns, eggs benedict, waffles, blueberry filled crapes, and crispy bacon.  For a buffet it was extremely fresh as if it was made to order.

Lunch items included fresh shrimp, sushi, mini crab cakes, assorted salads, mosticholi, ravioli, baked fish, sauteed chicken breasts, and a carving station with turkey, ham, and roast beef...  All very, very good.

Desserts were equally goods and they even had a kids section with chicken fingers, mini corn dogs and tater tots.

Price wasn&#39;t even that bad but the BIG DISAPPOINTMENT was the 18% gratuity added to the end of the bill.  With a family of 8, this was an additional $60 for a nice waiter to bring us 2 Diet Cokes and keep our water filled. 

REALLY?  18% FOR A BUFFET?!!

Put a damper on what was a great time and meal.

We went on a Saturday night with 3 other couples and were the first to arrive around 6 pm....so we naturally wandered into the bar and found the last two seats. It was a full house, and the crowd was split between golfers, couples out on dates, and the few single men....nice tvs all around tuned to the Masters. Great service from the bartenders, quick to refill drinks and friendly...then we got called to dinner.

Dinning room is pretty small and we had a big table in the middle. Nicole was our server and she was marginal at best (worse as the night wore on). Apps were just ok, it was SLOW, and a band began to set up....pretty strange for 7:30 on Saturday night. Anyway after what seemed like a few hours we got to order and the band started to play.

They were LOUD, LOUD, LOUD, so loud you couldn&#39;t talk to the person next to you, and the lead singer/guitar player was HORRIBLE and a hog of the &#34;spotlight&#34;. I could not believe we were served food while a really loud band was playing in a small space....

The food itself was AWFUL. I had the BBQ Salmon and it was bad, overcooked and had the distinct taste of being dragged in the parking lot prior to hitting my plate.....don&#39;t think anyone else really liked theirs either. We were forced to watch and listen to the band because you could not speak to anyone.....

After dinner we wandered back to the bar, and there was still a good crowd. It seemed like many locals hang-out here, and as I said the bar is nice and fun. They also have a brick patio deck that is REALLY NICE.

NO WAY I came back here to eat, would play the golf course any day.

I went out there a couple of years back and it&#39;s a wonder I didn&#39;t break an ankle. Everyone kept raving about their waxless skis--but just because you DON&#39;T wax them, doesn&#39;t mean they are waxless. I had about 3-4 inches of snow unevenly distributed to the bottom of my skis throughout the whole time I was trying to ski.  It clings to the wood rather than sliding off if they were waxed and so it makes it a challenge to even stand on them, let alone ski. I&#39;ve cc skied in other places but would never come back here. It&#39;s a broken ankle waiting to happen. I get that they want to figure out a way to generate revenue in the winter, but perhaps snowshoeing is the way to go."

When planning our wedding reception we thought this would be a good candidate, but when we approached the management we were informed that there was a $26,000 MINUMUM payment required, and that their idea of &#34;top shelf&#34; liquor ran along the lines of absolut vodka. Granted this was a few years ago but it was enough to make me want to steer clear.
 For $26,000 you had better be serving something better than absolut."

I&#39;m only reviewing the restaurant portion of Arrowhead but its great!  A hidden gem I suppose. My boyfriend and I for some reason thought we could go out to dinner without a reservation in Naperville on a Tuesday night.. not being familiar with the area I expected that wasn&#39;t a big deal. But I guess everyone in Naperville eats out every single night of the week because holy moly our first choices were packed.

I&#39;m glad I happened to browse the Arrowhead menu a week earlier.  I called ahead and the hostess was friendly and informed me there was no wait (around 7pm).  We got there and there definitely was no wait.. maybe no one knows about this place? There were three other groups dining there besides ourselves.

I had been eyeing the duck and cheddar grilled cheese, so I ordered that. It was good but I wouldn&#39;t classify it as &#34;grilled cheese&#34; because it was about 25% cheese and 75% duck/other stuff.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;d order it again but it was still good.

My boyfriend ordered the bacon &amp; beer pork tenderloin. WOW that was good. The pork was grilled perfectly. The bacon-beer butter sauce was heavenly! They should bottle that stuff and sell it. The dish would only be more perfect if there was more bacon beer butter sauce. Finally, it also came with an &#34;herb potato cake&#34; which is pretty much a large triangular tater tot. There were two and they were also insanely delicious.

The price was more than right too.. especially for the bacon beer pork tenderloin. $17? Incredible. I&#39;m definitely coming back here because I have my eye on the Disaronno Shrimp and Ravioli and the Johnnie Walker braised beef short ribs.. and the baby spinach.. and... and...

OH and their fries are perfectly crispy/crunchy. Like McDonald&#39;s but better. If you like crispy fries which IMO are the only way to go."

I figured the likelihood of there being good food to be found in a restaurant on a golf course (a public course, at that!) was pretty low.

I was happily proven wrong.

This turns out to be a lovely place for a wedding reception or a special event. On this particular night the place was packed to the gills with various events, including a reunion for a local high school.  Despite the fact that I think I might have been the youngest person in the room, the crowd was loud and boisterous - I&#39;m a bit curious to see what it&#39;s like here on a weeknight. Even so, the place seemed very warm and inviting and service was great.

The food here, quite simply, is delicious.  I had an herb-marinated chicken sandwich with Brie and basil - a combination I probably wouldn&#39;t have thought of but which proved to be really, really good.  Our friend had the fish tacos and said they were very good as well.  Everything seemed fairly reasonably priced - I can&#39;t wait to come back to try some other things, as they all sounded yummy.  I&#39;ve also heard good things about the brunch.

The best part about Arrowhead (at least to me)? I&#39;m told there are FREE (or at least really cheap) cooking classes and wine tastings.  How cool is that?!"

Somebody at the party tried taking the circle mirror center piece and one of the waitresses had to regulate. I mean come on; you could probably find that ish at Hobby Lobby for 5 bucks!

I personally dont have one bad thing i could say about the staff, the venue, or the service included. Across the board, they nailed everything. Kristina &amp; Jaci (event coordinators) were available for all my questions while in the planning phases and were around to make sure the actual day of went well! Even with horrible rain clouds moving in, the staff had a backup plan to make sure everything went smooth.

I loved that Arrowhead hosted a &#34;bridal expo&#34; for already signed couples about six months or so before the wedding. It helped you narrow down appetizers, deserts, wines and late night snack options. 

I also LOVE that theres only one wedding per night. You&#39;re not cramped into the venue with another party and get to hog the whole space to yourselves.

Highly recommend!!"

The place is very nice and surprisingly more affordable than I thought. We booked our small wedding here. i had a hard time getting a hold of my contact/consultant - I think because mine was a smaller wedding, they didn&#39;t feel the need to return calls as promptly.

The day of the wedding went fine, things were set up just as I had detailed.  However, right before the dinner service the woman I had been in contact with pulled me aside, in my gown and in full view of my guests, to tell me quietly that there had been a health inspection and that the servers were required to wear gloves. I said white gloves, like butlers? &#34;No&#34; she said &#34;plastic gloves&#34;

I was freaking out, imagining the sight of my guests being disgusted and my wedding now looking like a hospital cafeteria. I said &#34;NO, please don&#39;t do that&#34; So the servers did indeed serve bare-handed, and everything seemingly went fine the rest of the day.

On the second day of my honeymoon, I checked my email to find half a dozen emails from friends and relatives, who had forwarded a news story -  &#34;Arrowhead Banquet facility closed for INFECTIOUS EMPLOYEE VIOLATION.&#34; This happened the weekend of our wedding, and my guests were wondering if they were going to get sick. 

Suddenly the gloves comment made sense and I started crying - that news absolutely ruined that honeymoon day, and now when friends and family talk about my wedding, they always mention the health code violation story that was all on the news. 

As an adult, I can&#39;t say it totally destroyed my wedding, but it was a horribly significant splotch on what should have been a lovely occasion. Nobody from the facility even called to apologize or offer any sort of recompense. Because of their treatment, I would not do business with them again or encourage others to do the same."

Everything was coordinated so well and it went just the way we wanted. Kristina spent a lot of time with us before the wedding and did a great job responding to questions quickly during the process.

The venue itself is beautiful, and we really enjoyed having the whole top level to just our wedding.  The food was amazing, and got many compliments on people who chose the vegetarian option, which was a vegetable lasagna.  The chef challenges his staff to come up with a vegetarian dish that will impress him, the best dish is the one that will be served, which is a very neat concept, and our guests were left satisfied! One of the primary reasons we chose Arrowhead was the big dance floor to accommodate all of our guests. We loved the layout of the room and the 3 separate balconies.

If getting a burger, get the Pretzel bun.

Service in the restaurant is sometimes slow, but if you&#39;re lucky enough to sit in the bar when Colette is working, you&#39;ll be treated very, very well. She&#39;s awesome. 

We&#39;ve been going there about once every 3 weeks for their burger since the remodel years ago.

Best to go when the weather is bad so the golfers don&#39;t take over the bar.

I had my daughter in law&#39;s baby shower there and the staff, food and the coordinator Michelle was amazing.  I must have called and changed my mind on stuff 8 times and she never seem bothered at all with my calls or my requests.  She allowed me to tweak the menu to meet my budget and was there Hands on that day to make sure everything went off well.  My guest Loved the food and raved about the Tomato Soup!   Thank you again Michelle to you and your staff....we will be back for a future event for sure.

I ate lunch here before playing golf. We asked the host if we could sit outside and she was happy to sit us anywhere. The patio has a beautiful view of the golf course. Our server (Brian) was friendly &amp; knowledgeable. He kept our drinks filled and was available if we needed anything. 

They were offering $2 draft beers as the daily drink special. The beer had a strange taste so I decided to order a bottle beer. The bottles of beer were only a little more than draft beer. I chose the California Chicken wrap as my entree. The wrap was filled with grilled chicken, bacon, cheese, avocado, and red peppers. The wrap was prepared fresh and had a great taste. 

They have a wide variety of items in their lunch menu. They offer basic appetizers, soups/salads, burgers, sandwiches, tacos, etc. Ashbury also has different menus for breakfast and dinner. I would love to try breakfast here of we had an earlier tee time. 

We were able to enjoy lunch and a beer before playing golf. We told our server our tee time and did not have to rush. 

Overall- great tasting food, accommodating  service, and beautiful view! I will be back soon!"

I have to admit, it is not for everyone. However, my wife and I like it. Food is good. Decent wine selection with nice pour. Nice to eat on the patio or inside the bar. Staff is always friendly. Great place to catch the game, plenty of TVs for all fans. It is nice to have this little neighborhood gem in our backyard."

Yesterday, on lunch, my wife and I went into the dining room. Nobody else was in there and there were only a handful of people in the bar area.  I&#39;d imagine most people have time constraints for their lunch but this was not accounted for whatsoever. After bringing us back our waters, we told the gentleman serving us that we would like to order. He continues to walk away tells us to hold on one minute. We let 8-10 minutes go by and decided he had no concept of time, so we had to leave.  I have had good food/service from here before, so I think this was an anomaly but for now I&#39;ll have to give them just 3 stars."

We could not have been happier with everything! The event coordinator, Michelle, was absolutely wonderful to work with. From the moment we booked the venue in January she was always available to answer all of my questions and concerns. As the date got closer and I had a million details to contend with,  she really took a lot of stress off of me by having everything on her end under control. She really rolled with all the last minute changes and was able to accommodate everything we asked for.  Our event space was beautiful and the service was excellent. So many people complimented the food afterwards, everything was delicious! Best of all was the price was very reasonable. We had a specific budget for the wedding and I really thought it looked far more expensive than it actually was. I would definitely recommend Ashbury&#39;s to anyone looking for a great place to host a special event."

The food was decent and the beer selection was also pretty good. We sat at the bar, which was sporting the Hawks in high def on several TVs with audio!

 The food was TERRIBLE. I&#39;m sure prison food is better. My husband ordered the 10oz sirloin meal...the mashed potatoes were fresh out of the box. They were runny and the steak was prepackaged and dry! 

I ordered the Cajun shrimp pasta and it had NO flavor at all, no spice, nothing. The food is NOT fresh made by the chef it comes premade (I requested no onion in my pasta and the waitress said it comes premixed). The server forgot our appatizer another fresh out of the can spinach and artichoke dip. My husband&#39;s beer was warm.

Now dont get me wrong..I love kids, I even have one who is a teen. But There was a family with 3 or 4 kids, all ages 8 and above that were EXTREMELY loud, didn&#39;t care about the other patrons (total of 3 other tables). The parents said nothing to them either. The Sad thing was the parents were worse than the kids, banging on the table the dad playing music on his cell while the son decided he wanted to sing OUT LOUD. I&#39;m not sure who was worse..the trashy parents or the children that seemed to be raised in a mad house! 

The best thing about this place was, the food was on the house..probably because we didn&#39;t eat it. Save your money and go elsewhere!! 

I will NEVER ever return to Ashbury&#39;s! First and last time!"

However, we were informed it was  &#34;Date Night&#34; which means we got an appetizer and 2 entrees for $20 and home made chips.  Are you kidding me?  That&#39;s great.

Food was served hot and our burgers were very juicy.  There was a great view of the golf course.  There is outdoor seating ~ both covered and open, a separate bar area, and an area on the second floor for private parties.

They offer daily specials for drinks and food and Sunday through Thursday kids eat free if they are 10 or under, with an adult.

I think they have every family member covered :)"

We were looking for a place to grad breakfast. When we walked in there was no one to great us, only a sign to go upstairs for a wedding shower. We ventured into the bar, and the bartender did not even look at us. A disheveled woman asked if she could help us? We asked if we could have breakfast, she seated us in the dining room and said someone would be right with us. It was a good 10 minutes before a server came to take our drink order. She was nice and polite and repeated our order back to ensure it was correct. The menu was limited, but we thought how bad can eggs be? Well let me tell you, then can be bad! I ordered an omelet with eggs, ham, cheese and jalapeno peppers. While my fiancé ordered an egg sandwich with ham on rye bread. When my omelet came it was greasy and dirty; it had been cooked on the grill top that apparently had not been cleaned in years!! I have never been served DIRTY EGGS! The jalapeno peppers were raw, and the ham was greasy as well. My toast was burnt black on one side and the ice tea (that the server said was just brewed, tasted like it was run through the coffee pot)! This was a lack luster meal to say the least. Half way through the meal they changed servers (even though we were the only ones in the dining room) and she did not come back to our table to see if everything was OK, or if we needed anything. This is a meal I will never get my money back on, and time wasted that I will never get back. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND MY PASS THIS PLACE FOR FOOD!"

The steak and seafood is delicious and they have a huge bar menu with tasty appetizers, cocktails, and a good beer/wine selection. 

Anything you are looking for Ashbury&#39;s can offer it and they have a beautiful atmosphere with a great view of the course. And you don&#39;t have to golf, you can eat there and the value is excellent for the quality, portion, and service.

We were going to catch a comedy show upstairs from the restaurant, and had heard the restaurant was good. So we headed out early to eat there. When we walked in the door, the signage was not very good. We had to search a bit for the restaurant. Once we found it, the sign said, &#34;Please seat yourself&#34; but there were only 6-person tables and we didn&#39;t want to take up a large table. So we found a waitress and asked her. She said, &#34;How many?&#34; and we answered, &#34;2.&#34; She disappeared and we waited as people kept walking past us and seating themselves. Then a waitress comes along and says, &#34;The sign says seat yourself.&#34; &#34;What am I, freaking blind? And how rude are you?!&#34; I was thinking.  I answered, &#34;Well, the other waitress asked us how many we had and went to find us a table.&#34; She looked at us disgustedly and took off. A few minutes later, still no one. So we left. 
When we returned for the comedy show, again, no signage as to where it might be. So we walked upstairs to see. We had it right. We signed in at the table and were pointed to the world&#39;s smallest room with chairs jammed right next to each other at tables. I mean, there was not even enough room to pull your chair out and get in. The larger people at the show and older folks had a real problem navigating. It would have been a death trap if there were a fire. 
We ordered a beer and a lemonade. The beer was in a bottle so it was fine, but the lemonade tasted ... how do I describe this ... like sweat. It was gross. 
The &#34;house comedian&#34; who opened the show was horrible. He seemed to swear just for shock value. His favorite word ever is bull----. I know this because he must have said it at least 20 times in the 10 minutes he was up there. The main comedians weren&#39;t bad, but not worth the $20. 
So, save your money and time and don&#39;t eat or see a comedy show here."

Specialty&#39;s is a pretty unique place, they offer a wide variety of sandwiches, salads, pastries and coffee beverages among other things. It appears that they aim to use quality ingredients, without preservatives or other undesirable additives. I really like places like this because all too many fast food options use nasty stuff in their food that most people should care about, but don&#39;t. Definitely worth paying a little more for.

I got a large chicken cobb, which had romaine lettuce, tomato, mushroom, bacon, blue cheese, avocado and egg with ranch dressing. Also included was a small chunk of bread. The salad itself was GIGANTIC! Literally enough for two people to split. I think next time I&#39;ll opt for the smaller size. The salad itself was really really good! Everything blended together quite well and the ingredients tasted fresh.

My very minor constructive criticism would be to include slightly more dressing as well as a few more tomatoes. Other than that, it was a great salad and I would recommend it to anyone who likes cobb salads.

The only problem with it was the price. I know that Specialty&#39;s offers a higher quality, no nonsense product that should rightfully be a little more expensive, however my lunch was nearly $12. I think next time I&#39;ll either try to split a large salad with someone or just opt for the small.

Still a great salad without any of the usual fast food bs, I will definitely be back."

Naperville is definitely not her &#34;hood,&#34; as what she would say.  As noon approached and our needs for food were getting demanding, she consulted Yelp for recommendations on quick, affordable lunch spots.  &#34;Specialty&#39;s&#34; came up and we gave it a go.  

&#34;Specialty&#39;s&#34; is a solid choice for people who have food allergies, diet restrictions, or are generally and habitually picky.  Hubby was able to adhere the vegetarian diet with the veggie sando, while I go with my typical beef and blue cheese sandwich.  

The &#34;buzzer&#34; that you hold onto after placing the order through the clerk at the register or through the i-pad reminds you when the food is ready to be picked up.  This is a popular lunch joint for corporate people working nearby.  However, be super cautious when leaving the parking lot.  The spaces are quite tight.

Tap in your order, swipe your card, and pick up your pager. --Simple and uncomplicated and no need for ear buds.

As a woman who usually prefers soup and salad but who&#39;s married to a man who could eat a sandwich for every meal of the day, I appreciate their menu. He can chow on his Beef &amp; Blue (YUM) or his Rueben &#34;Rebecca&#34; (YUM) and I can sip my Pellegrino with my Tomato Fennel soup. --love that. 

Sometimes a sandwich does sound good and since He would never order the Turkey, Apple, and Brie or the Turkey Pesto (and I most certainly would), I cannot always rely on him for a few bites. I might order a sandwich but soup is always my common denominator. While there aren&#39;t a ton of choices like their salad and sandwich options, the soups they do offer are good. A good mix of cream based as well as broth based. 

While this place is similar to Panera, I much, much prefer it over Panera. I swear everything at Panera tastes exactly the same no matter what you order. The ingredients here are fresher and taste far less processed.

If I could complain at all it&#39;s that they use plastic flatware. Eating with plastic almost  induces a &#34;nails on a chalkboard&#34; reaction for me. I loathe it. Even just the thought of eating salad while envisioning plastic tines bending or breaking off makes my blood pressure rise. I am not above bringing my own silverware just to avoid. ;)"

Yes, you still have to confer with the paper menu to know what&#39;s actually in a given sandwich or salad, because the board on the wall is a sphinx and just gives the names. But there are still lots of options, and friendly staff besides. 

I got the turkey, apple, brie, and bacon sandwich on ciabatta: I&#39;m not even a turkey person, but damn this sandwich was good! The textures played off one another nicely, and the roasting of the apple was a nice touch. A hint of lemon thyme aioli rounded it out. 

Dad got the &#34;Big BLT&#34; which still did not seem especially big to me but he thought it was good and most importantly, it was plentiful with bacon.

We sat on the side near the registers, where some small tables were available, and were treated to the staff bombastically calling orders back and forth to one another in a silly manner. This might amuse or irritate you, depending on your mood or personality, so plan accordingly.

The first thing I noticed were the hours of operation on the door, stating that they are closed on weekends on holidays. A business environment. Different. Then I noticed that they were a bakery and cafe and feared my options would be pastries, coffee, and tea. Nope!

I totally missed the ordering screens and ordered with the lady at the counter. She was kind, patient, and offered me a sample of the tuna salad. Needless to say, it was delicious and I ordered the sandwich which comes on wheat bread (something I don&#39;t normally eat but it&#39;s a special treat!). After ordering, I was peeking at the cookies and decided to order one. She said the cookie was on the house, a much appreciated gesture, making it easier to consume the calories. :)

Sitting at a table, I noticed the industrial &#34;Restoration Hardware&#34; meets Seattle Starbucks Roasting Room Style. The fireplace was a warming touch. There were plenty of tables, many of them with electrical outlets. There was a group of people working on a project, someone reading by the fire, and a few people eating and working at a few tables.

This place seems to be ideal for working alone, in groups, or having a business lunch (and non business too!). The food is similar to Panera/Atlanta Bread Company but much better quality and taste.

The &#34;gourmet&#34; turkey, brie and bacon was delicious but $10?!?! No sides, not even a measly pickle! 

There&#39;s tons of seating inside, even a fireplace. But I found the lack of booths uninviting. I like to cozy up in a booth, grab some food and drink while getting some work done in the afternoon. 

I didn&#39;t have a chance to try any of their pastries, but they looked pretty good. Maybe I&#39;ll try again for breakfast one of these days."

The interior is modern, clean, and the employees are friendly and helpful. They just opened on Thursday, I believe. 

Sandwiches are categorized as Classic,  Deluxe,  and Gourmet. Most come with  &#34;the basics&#34; which is lettuce, tomato, dill pickle, red onion, black pepper, and their house made Italian dressing. I tried the Four Cheese sandwich which was amazing! The four cheeses include cheddar,  Muenster, swiss, and provolone.  They were out of sourdough bread so I had to choose an alternative (toasted herb) but it was so soft and full of flavor, it paired with the cheeses quite well and I didn&#39;t mind the substitution at all.

Their breakfast sandwiches look enticing as well.  However, I couldn&#39;t tell if an egg white substitution is available, which was disappointing.

They also have baked goods and a full coffee bar offering Peet&#39;s Coffee and Tea, and Intelligentsia Coffee.  If you order a bottle of water, you have a choice of either Dasani or Smart water.

I like how they have personal ordering stations but I didn&#39;t utilize them. The cashiers were nice and were helpful to patrons that had questions. Food prices vary depending on your meal, obv... but they seem to be on par with Panera, Corner Bakery Cafe, etc.

Specialty&#39;s is like Starbucks and Panera Bread got together and had a baby. It&#39;s a nice concept and I look forward to future visits."

I am biased just a tad just for the fact that I can walk here from work but with that being said you can make this place convenient for yourself as well, all you have to do is order online and advise what time you will be picking up your food. As soon as you walk in your food is in a bag waiting for you ready to go, this makes the process a whole lot easier and quicker. I have been to Specialtys about a dozen times and each time I have tried something new and honestly I haven&#39;t had a sandwich that was underwhelming. They have breakfast sandwiches, soups, salads and desserts along with Peets coffee. My biggest gripe would have to be the prices, you are going to pay roughly $7-8 per sandwich and that is without sides. With the prices however comes a bigger portion. They also offer a rewards program, all you have to do is enroll online."

I got the Hot Cheesy Steak Sandwich $8. It was okay. It was very small. I got it to go- so when I got home to eat it, the paper that the sandwich was wrapped in stuck to the bread and was really hard to peel off. I don&#39;t know if this is the perfect comparison but I would much rather eat a Jersey Mike&#39;s Chipotle Steak Sub or a Firehouse Cheese Steak Sub than this Cheesy Steak Sandwich. First off, it&#39;s roast beef and not even cheese. Second, the cheese is not a normal sandwich cheese- it was cream cheese which I hesitated about- it wasn&#39;t as good as Cheddar or American- no melty gooey effect- but I thought it was an interesting concept. I also got the tomato bisque soup $3. It was the tiniest cup of soup ever! It was creamy and thick- pretty good.

My husband always likes getting the &#34;Peanut Butter and Stuff Sandwich.&#34; $6.  I forget what exactly is in it- PB &amp; J, Apples, Bananas, Nuts, etc. I&#39;m not a fan of PB so I didn&#39;t try it but he loves that sandwich.

I think Specialty&#39;s specialty is it&#39;s Black and White Chocolate Chip Cookie $2.79. It&#39;s quite big, chewy, and really scrumptious with white and milk chocolate chips. We also got the Ginger Molasses $2.79 cookie- it was alright. It was big and chewy but the Ginger was just too strong.

This place closes at 7pm - it&#39;s more of a lunch place which is why it closes so early. All in all, I would come back here for the Black and White Chocolate Chip Cookie- otherwise I think it&#39;s super over priced for the sub-par flavored sandwiches. My hubby will probably come back for the PB&amp;Stuff Sandwich though!"

They offer self service ordering and also offer old fashioned counter service, and the availability of both allows quick service even at peak morning hours.  My daughter and I were pleased with the variety of bakery options.  She had a cinnamon roll, served warm, and I had a spinach and cheese croissant, also warm.

Stopped after my chiropractor apt right around the corner and I&#39;m glad I did! I did check out the menu beforehand since I&#39;m &#34;that person&#34; that takes forever in line and STILL doesn&#39;t know what to get! Anywho, the decor is nice....I&#39;d say rustic modern. It&#39;s got a weathered wood next to steel feel. When I walked in, I thought they were a division of Peet&#39;s, which has been popping up all over the Chicagoland area. To my surprise, they just partner with Peet&#39;s for their coffee! Although they sell the coffee and all the specialty drinks, they&#39;re a company all their own. Another Yelper hit it right on the money....it&#39;s like Starbucks and Panera had a baby! 

I was definitely in the mood for a sandwich. I definitely appreciate that the menu goes from Classic sandwiches (blt, turkey, tuna, etc) to Deluxe (mostly hot) to Gourmet! I had the Turkey, Apple, Brie and Bacon....and omg, delicious! I did take it home, so the cheese got a little lukewarm, however the flavors were still there! I also had a small cup of the cream of chicken with wild rice. I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the focaccia, which I thought was dry, but this may be because I got soup at 7pm. 

I can&#39;t wait to try more options....the desserts and baked goods looked great, and some other gourmet sandwiches! Hope they stay around!"

The Sea Salt Caramel Mocha, accompanied by a Chocolate Chip Cappuccino Scone made for a decadent, sugar-filled breakfast.  I felt pretty wired straight through the afternoon.  Both were delicious, especially the scone.

The inside of the cafe is spacious, perfect for camping out on the WiFi or chatting with friends.  It&#39;s more inviting than most Starbucks locations, just due to it&#39;s size alone.

They also a good number of pastries including cookies, scones, breads and other sugar-laced goodies.  I was here for lunch so coffee wasn&#39;t on the radar, otherwise they had a large selection spattered with &#34;specialty&#34; drinks.  Sorry..no pun intended. 
The only downside was the price, which is a little on the steep side for a bread sandwich.  Personally though, I think their food is worth every penny."

Free lunch?! Yay! 

However, I did order a sandwich, a bag of chips and because it looked amazing, a thing called Lover&#39;s Lane bar. My total was just over $13, so I still ended up paying $3 for my free lunch. which is totally awesome but yet - I feel like a sandwich shouldn&#39;t cost $8. I get that Panera is expensive too, but the chips or apple come with it. Nothing comes with this sandwich. You would think a $10 gift card should cover an entire lunch.

The sandwich was good, it was called the Chairman. I ordered it without sprouts on account of being pregnant, and without mayo and ranch because I didn&#39;t really need all that and it was a delightful sandwich - I will order it again. 

The Lover&#39;s Lane bar though - that&#39;s something that needs to be ordered over and over. It&#39;s coconut and brownie and I don&#39;t know what else, but it was dense and chewy and amazing. 

I agree with other reviewers that the set up is a little wonky. The descriptions of the sandwiches aren&#39;t on the board. i happened to have looked online before coming, so I knew what I wanted. otherwise I think I would have been confused. There&#39;s also this weird counter with computers on it that looked like you could...order your lunch there instead of at the counter? what is that? Someone explain it to me. 

Seriously, the almost entirely free lunch thing from the credit union + a tasty big sandwich + that freaking brownie =  allstars."

The drink was pretty good not to sweet, but kinda upset that a medium was pretty small for 4$ so not really worth it. The salad was great. I had the dressing tossed.

I stopped in once during their pre-opening - lured in by people standing outside with free cookie samples!  I didn&#39;t realize it was still a training day, until the manager swiped his card and said - &#34;Thanks, you can wait for your food over there!&#34;  Had I realized it was on the house, I would&#39;ve ordered a coffee too!  While my sandwich didn&#39;t come out with the substitutions that I had made (add cheese, minus onion - it came without cheese and with onion) it was still tasty and fresh, and I gave them the benefit of the doubt as it was a massive training day.

I returned the following week to try again, and this time to check out a coffee as well!  I came in, and ordered on a tablet, easy peasy.  This time I tried the Vegan Chili with a side of focaccia bread, and ordered an Eggnog Latte.  However, almost as soon as I clicked order, they called out my name and said they were really sorry - but they didn&#39;t have the eggnog yet, if I really wanted it, they&#39;d run someone over to Target - but I didn&#39;t need the eggnog that bad, so I went with just a Vanilla Latte instead.  The Chili was delicious, but the side of bread was a on the tiny side, about 3 bites worth.  The Vanilla Latte won me over though!  Peet&#39;s is now my go to coffee - Starbucks no more for me!

I did visit on a third occasion because I wanted a coffee, and ordered a deluxe sandwich, the hammer, I think it was called.  It ordered it to go, and it was a delicious sandwich - all my substitutions were correct this time around.

I would say they&#39;re a step up from Panera on the food quality and options - but about equal on price.  They&#39;re not the cheapest on the block, but they&#39;re pretty fast good food, and a nice atmosphere.  Everything (at least at this point) is fresh and prepared with care.  I love the ease of ordering - the tablets automatically save your info based on the credit card you swipe you can see your historical orders and re-order easily.  Supposedly you can order online and just pickup when you arrive - though I haven&#39;t done that yet.

Will I be back - yes.  Will it be a regular lunch stop - probably not due to the price."

It is average at best. Dried out and overcooked bacon, scarce cheese and eggs are just ok. I believe I saw the cook microwave the whole sandwich before wrapping it up, this resulted in very dry bread. I had to tear a big piece off because it was too hard to chew. This sandwich could use some moisture - overall, the flavors are what you would expect from Dunkin Donuts and the texture dry. Would not recommend.

The first time, I had a mozzarella and tomato sandwich and this past time I had a vegetarian sandwich. In both cases, my meal was quite good and ingredients were very fresh. I have also enjoyed the sweets from the bakery case. 
The restaurant is not as busy as the neighboring chipoltle but I think that is because people may not necessarily know all it has to offer! Sandwiches, salads, bakery - a list of options and the ability to customize means there are many options for any taste!  
The people who work behind the counter are customer focused.
So, why the four stars? I have noticed they are not proactive about cleaning off tables - several tables had crumbs both times I visited - and emptying trash in the dining area. I think this could be due to the relative youth (inexperience) of the staff or lax work environment - I am not sure.

I didn&#39;t use them this time, but I liked the idea of the kiosks they have for ordering. The staff was super friendly, and very helpful as far as recommendations, without being too insistent. They serve Peets coffee, which is wonderful--I tried the Sea Salt Caramel Mocha on recommendation and it was fantastic.

Their food is okay and I really don&#39;t care for any of their baked goods, but the coffee and tea are AMAZING!  Brought some friends there last month and they got hooked too.  What I really like about it is the atmosphere.  Unlike the cave type atmosphere of Starbucks, this place is light and airy and spacious.  It has a fireplace and two full sized couches in a nook.  It&#39;s very relaxing and comforting.  I actually went there in a snowstorm to get some coffee and a little relaxation.  The only downside is that they aren&#39;t open on weekends."

I was heading to Target and saw this venue from the road with a &#34;Now Open&#34; sign. Stopped in to check it out. It&#39;s another great cafe to relax in, especially after seeing a movie across the street. They offer pastries, coffee, cocoa, and sandwiches. They have several people behind the counter to help you and in addition to them you can make your order on one of the few tablets they have set up to handle additional orders. I was reading the two other Yelp reviews while I had my drink and one person mentions the staff&#39;s upbeat energy. That hits the nail on the head. The staff were pleasantly upbeat. I kept watching one of the bakers at work in the kitchen. He was wearing jeans, a flannel shirt, and the biggest grin I&#39;ve ever seen on anyone in a professional kitchen; he truly enjoyed what he was doing. I&#39;m definitely going to have stop back in again next time I&#39;m at Regal. Plus, free wi-fi. Why not stop in to contemplate, write, and post your thoughts on the film here too?"

This is now, one of my faves in the burbs.

Last night, my BF and I decided that we want a light dinner that&#39;s close by.... ahhhhh.  Dolce it is...

Surprisingly, it wasn&#39;t crowded and the bar was empty.

As soon as we walk in... a friendly gal greeted us.. Anica ( pronounced Anitza ) 

I felt like a celebrity coz 2 gals walk in and sat at the bar ... Lynn and Leanne... I&#39;m hoping this is how they spell their names...

They said that they were reading the recommended reviews for Dolce and they decided to pick up pizza.

I&#39;m like... my reviews are always &#34;recommended reviews&#34; 

Lynn was like... are you GiGi? 

So yup... I felt great leading new customers to this place... they even tried the roasted beets and they loved it...

Jessica, the chef was super friendly and checking on us..... making sure we are satisfied... 

We ordered the following:

Barbers bottle $32... very good
Roasted beets $7 .... to die for, I can eat this all day... and I hate beets... so this tells you it&#39;s very good
Mussels $12? .... very tasty
Sausage pizza $11.... you got me at homemade sausage and crispy thin pizza... yum
Lemon creme brûlée 
Sea salt soufflé 
2 cappuccinos 

Total bill $80+ tip = $100

For the ambience, quality of the food, friendly faces -- totally worth it...

Can&#39;t wait for our next dinner here..."

At $16 for a cheese/meat plate you can expect massive cheese chunks, grapes, and an entire salad in the center of your spread.  The sausage found in some of the pastas is great as well. Authentic and impressive wine list. On a Thursday we overheard one of the waitresses mention to another customer that it was  1/2 price bottle of wine night. We would have loved to hear this special prior to ordering....

Just make sure you arrive well before 10pm. We witnessed the girls running the place straight up hide from customers looking to dine around 9:30. Similarly we were turned away upon our first visit for arriving too late."

The spot is on a side street and there is plenty of parking (we were there on a Tuesday evening around 6:30).  It is quite tiny but charming inside like an old school pizzeria.  However, there was no bar area.  That is a must for a pizza spot, in my opinion.  You need a location where the locals can go and love your pizza and watch a game.  This isn&#39;t the vibe you get here.  There were two women working the front of the house and they seemed a bit disorganized.  Sometimes they came by very quickly but at first, when we sat down, no one came over to take our drink order for five minutes and there were only 3 other tables with guests.  Once we ordered the drinks, it took a while to get them but then the server immediately asked if we were ready to order.  I prefer to relax with a drink for a few minutes first.  I got a red wine which was chilled, and I appreciated that.  We eventually got the Augie&#39;s Bianca pizza.  Firstly, the crust was good but I found the middle to be too soggy instead of having a nice crispiness to it.  The description of the pizza says garlic and onion but I didn&#39;t get any of those.  What was there was there was what I believe was a grilled fennel.  While I still thought this was tasty, my husband doesn&#39;t like fennel so he found himself picking all of these off.  After which, he did see some caramelized onion underneath so they must have put some on but I think the description of this pizza was just off.  I happen to love garlic and onion so would have enjoyed it more if these were the two flavors that we got, although I do like fennel as well.  The arugula salad on top was accurate though and it was just wilted enough so we both enjoyed that aspect.  Overall, I would go back but maybe try charcuterie or something that fits the vibe a bit better.  It&#39;s almost like combining a pizza parlor with a wine bar but neither one seem to be winning out."

It&#39;s tiny and I went on a Sunday evening and the place was only serving two other tables. There&#39;s outside seating and lots of parking in front.

The staff was nice and professional. The menu had mostly wine by glass or bottle and appetizers/salads/pizza/entrees. Only downside was we could see cobwebs on chandeliers above the tables so that kind of ruined our appetite. Made me wonder where else they were in the restaurant... 

We had: meatballs, mozzerella/ tomato salad, bruschetta, veggie lasagna, and three different types of pizza. The bruschetta is good but not worth the $3. It&#39;s a small piece of bread and you only get one. It&#39;s like a regular bruschetta but has capers. The veggie lasagna was okay but I&#39;ve had better- and the noodles were el dente. Everything else was delicious- we loved the balsamic reduction on the salad. 

All in all, nice little place to come for date night."

These also were not up to their standard quality.  The pizzas are their normal one person pizzas.  The price of this meal was over $49.00.   For the quality and quantity this was expensive.

It was smaller than I expected, but it wasn&#39;t super busy so it wasn&#39;t a problem. Actually, it was kinda nice because it felt more intimate and cozy on a cold night. We started off with an appetizer of bruchetta. We were confused at first because it gave the price for one bruchetta. Wtf does that mean? One helping? One plate with a few? Nope. It means one piece. Silly American big portions mind. However, the one piece was a good size, because it had a big heaping of tomato, basil balls, and cheese. It was really good.

Then we had some wine. They were out of a few, but they still had a lot of good options. They pour the wine in a mini water glass and then leave the pouring glass there with you.

We ordered a sausage pizza. The italian sausage is homemade and it had a nice spice to it. The pizza was very thin and light, so you and your dining partner can surely eat it in one sitting. The cheese was just right and the crust had that nice firewood burned crispiness. 

We still had room in our bellies since the portions were light, so we had dessert. I had a chocolate souflee with gelato and my fiance had creme brulee. Both were incredible. I&#39;d come back for that alone.

Our waitress was really nice and helpful and checked on us frequently. I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant and I will gladly come back."

We went there last night for Valentine&#39;s Day. I picked it out because it&#39;s local and it seemed to have a nice atmosphere from the yelp photos.
We made dinner reservations at 7 pm and they were able to seat up promptly. I do recommend making reservations. It was busy and I&#39;m not sure without them you&#39;d be able to find seating. There were 2 servers for the whole place. Although it is small, it seems as though one more server would have been a good idea. We ordered our wine and then an appetizer and he didn&#39;t take our order for our food until we received our appetizer. I prefer ordering everything at once and having them figure out when it&#39;s appropriate to put things in the oven. Oh well.
He seemed busy, our waiter did. Nice and polite, but busy. He didn&#39;t explain any of the menu choices as he did to the table next to us. He just handed us the &#34;Valentine&#39;s Day special menu&#34; and left. We ended up ordering from the normal menu, but no explanations were given. I might have liked to order the butternut squash ravioli that he explained to the table next to us.
The appetizer we ordered was baked goat cheese. They give you about 6 tiny slices of bread and expect you to finish off this giant cup of goat cheese. Um, no. And it was $9. I wish I would&#39;ve gone for the bacon wrapped dates.
My fiancé ordered a pizza. And finished it. They&#39;re small enough that if you&#39;re hungry enough it&#39;s good for one, but if you eat other things, it would be good for two. I ordered the gnocchi with creamy pesto sauce, chicken, and pine nuts. It was amazing. Some of the gnocchi were a bit doughy and not all the way cooked but 70% of them were perfect. The chicken was dry. Very dry. Still tasty, albeit very dry.
We ordered the salted caramel chocolate soufflé for dessert. It was good, though it lacked any caramel, save for the caramel drizzled on the plate. There was no actual caramel in the dessert. Nor was it salted. 
It seems like a really nice restaurant and maybe we just had a bad experience. I&#39;m not saying it was horrible, but I just think the food could&#39;ve been better. Had the food been slightly better, we may have returned. However for the cost of the dinner and the quality of the food, we&#39;ll probably stick to our favorites instead."

Well tonight I wanted Italian and I wanted it to be close to home. This is a very cute/small place right off of Cass Avenue across from the train station. It has a very nice ambiance and the food was just GOOD. Small inside though so go early or don&#39;t mind being a little smashed in. 

Now the only down side I can come up with is SMALL portions BUT if you order a side salad(which was great) and enjoy the fresh bread with E.V.O.O and parm cheese it turns out being perfect. I guess if you think about Americans are a little too used to eating HUGE portions.

I enjoyed the Gnocchi - with roasted chicken, pesto cream, pine nuts. Wow what great flavors! My bf enjoyed  the Tortelloni - Beef &amp; veal tortelloni, brussel sprouts, mushrooms, veal demi cream sauce. He said it had a smooth rich mushroom sauce. Nice woodsy taste to the sauce. 

 Friendly staff and pretty good service. Interesting that the entire staff was male. That is rare. 

I would like to go back sometime and order a meat and cheese tray or some bruschetta and have a few glasses of wine. :)

Give them a try.

We went to dinner there on a Friday night at 5:30pm.  (we have a 15 month old--- hence the early dinner time).  At first, we were put off because when I called, they said they did not have a kid&#39;s menu.  To me when there is no children&#39;s menu, it typically means that it is not &#34;child friendly.&#34;  (This ended up being the complete opposite).  When they said that they had high chairs though, so we took a chance.

We ordered a pizzza and the white fish on couscous with spinach and mushrooms.  Both were delicious!  Our 1 year old loved it as well!  The atmosphere was fun, family friendly, and intimate.  (My husband and I moved from the city over a year ago, and I would say that Dolce&#39;s has an intimate city feel to it.)

Parking is decent--after 6pm M-F, the restrictions are lifted based on lower usage of the metra at that time.

The waitress was very attentive and friendly and even brought our 1 year old some dough from the kitchen to keep him occupied after he ate dinner.

We will definitely come back to this place to try more dishes!"

Located just south of the train tracks- Dolce&#39;s awning beckons visitors to sit and linger at their outdoor tables, or sit inside where the smell of the food makes you wonder what each dish is as it comes up. 

While this space used to be a coffee shop for weary commuters, it is now a comfortable trattoria with wooden tables scattered about, exposed red brick on one wall and large abstract paintings hung about. There is even a small bar area toward the front with about 6 seats. 

Their specialty dish is northern Italian pizza served in a wine bar atmosphere. While I&#39;ve never had their pizza- it looks good as several tables around us were eating it. Thin, crispy crust with lots of cheese.

I met a friend for a couple glasses of wine (they have my favorite, Mt .Vedeer Cab for only $8 a glass or a half bottle for $28 or bottle for $56). The downside? They serve the wine in a casual way- not in wine glasses (my fav) but in small water glasses. I guess they are going for the casual trattoria feel but it never really works for me. 

I also like their meat and cheese plates. Pick any two cheeses and any two meats (only $10) and you will find yourself with a large plate with pears, crackers, fruit relish, and all those wonderful sliced meats and cheeses. Pair it with a salad and you have a meal fit for a queen. 

We did try a couple of their pastas- the penne with alfredo sauce and chicken (delicious, or so I am told as my friend gobbled it up) and the orrecchiette with house sausage, mushroom and vodka sauce. While the menu calls for wild mushrooms- these tasted a little more like the canned variety but it was good nonetheless. 

Prices are reasonable with pasta going for around $10 a dish and no entree over $18. Parking is easy with free spaces out in front of the restaurant or you can park over by the train station. And know that they have a beer and wine license so you can taste one of their many wines if you go. 

Service was okay- a little slow to get the drinks but quick with everything else and certainly friendly enough. 

Given the limited opportunity for wine bars out this way- Dolce&#39;s was a welcome surprise on the night I was there. And hopefully given the lack of empty tables- there&#39;s hope that Dolce&#39;s will survive longer than the fate of those that have gone before them in the same space."

We have tried a number of Italian restaurants in the area, and we keep coming back to Dolce&#39;s! It is at a good price point. the waitstaff is attentive, the portions are reasonably sized for the money, and the food is delicious. I like the decor and layout of the restaurant and the outdoor seating area is an added bonus. They have a wine list consisting of both US and Italian wines, which provides enough variety without being overwhelming. 

For whatever reason, it seems as though it&#39;s hard to find good Italian restaurants in the LaGrange, Hinsdale, Clarendon Hills, Westmont area. Dolce&#39;s has consistently produced a high quality product and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for some good Italian food in the area. The menu is somewhat limited, but specials are available on most days we&#39;ve been there (though not all). 

In summary, Dolce&#39;s executes its concept of providing a more upscale dining experience while maintaining reasonable price points and decent variety. It has always been relatively busy even on weeknights which can tend to stretch the waitstaff a little thin (btw, i have seen just about the same waitstaff since we started going, which I really like), yet they remain friendly and attentive. 

If you&#39;re looking for Maggiano&#39;s size portions, this isn&#39;t the place for you. But, if you&#39;re looking for solid Italian food in a casual environment, with a slightly upscale bistro feel then you should check Dolce&#39;s out."

A lovely spot with very friendly staff.  I enjoyed the open atmosphere there.  Our server (name escapes me, drat!) was extremely helpful in choosing appetizers (oh, you should do this one if you&#39;re doing that one) so we tried prosciutto, soppressata, aged asiago, and drunken goat chese.  She also complimented us on your entree selections.  I had the Orrechiette (sp?).  It came in a perfectly sized bowl; the portion was not too big, not too small. We also had  the TK Pizza.  Just a perfect combination.  The place was pretty full when we left.
No room for dessert this time but looking forward to more adventures there soon."

It is decorated nicely, with a European feel and makes for a great atmosphere and good for conversation. We both felt very comfortable in the place.

We shared an Italian sausage pizza topped with Arugula. It was very light and just tasted great. We each a Pinot Grigio, although didn&#39;t spend much time on wine but will do that the next time around.

I will definitely go back to Dolce for another try. I think you should too."

The promise of Naples style pizza and antipasta platters was very appealing, as was the thought of it being a wine bar.  

First the positives:   The restaurant is decorated very nicely and had a great atmosphere.  Also, I enjoyed my pizza.  The pizzas are individually sized and have gourmet toppings available.  I saw a really cool oven in the back where they cook all of their pizzas.  Their bread that was served with the antipasta platter tastes fresh and is great as well.

The bad?  Well, I wouldn&#39;t consider this place a wine bar.  To me the #1 qualifier of a wine bar is that they have an extensive wine list, and serve flights to try out the different wines.  I couldn&#39;t believe there were no flights on the menu.  It seemed to me that there was no thought behind the wines purchased, and they just ordered wine and called themselves a wine bar.  Also a negative was that the antipasta platters were overpriced in my opinion.  It was around $3.50-$5 per item for the platter.  We picked 2 meats, 2 cheeses and a dip.  For $22 I expected more food than a few slices of meat and a few pieces of cheeses, or at least for the meats and cheeses to be artisan to justify getting such a small amount for a high price.  I could go down the street to the Italian deli to purchase most of these items myself, and wouldn&#39;t make a trip to a restaurant for something that I could do easily at home.  Carol reviewed that 2 meats and 2 cheeses were $10 but that pricing was not available during my visit.

Overall, I would go back for the pizza, and would even try some of the entrees on the menu, but skip the antipasta (unless the $10 deal is available) and don&#39;t go for the wine experience.  At the time of this review, Dolces is rated 3.5 stars, and I would call that a pretty accurate rating."

We started off with the recommended Meat &amp; Cheese tray and really enjoyed the asiago cheese with soppresata (among other treats).

Service was relaxed but ok. Trattoria-like menu with a selection of pasta, pizza, etc. Has an ok selection of cured meats and cheeses plates, which makes it a viable place to hang out for above-average snacks.
Plenty of comfortable seating, and the place is very clean.
I ordered a veal pasta. Of note was the fact that the kitchen seems to be entirely behind the bar, and I was seating at the bar: they cook on induction, I&#39;m pretty sure CookTek, which gave me burner envy. Joke aside, the chef actually tasted his dish, and discarded the tasting spoon, two facts that will surely make me return, even if the dish itself was about average. The asparagus were cooked properly but weren&#39;t the best; the veal was tender but not quite as much as I&#39;d have liked for a ragu; the pasta (I think it was linguini -can&#39;t remember just now) was again cooked well but didn&#39;t taste homemade.
I tried the pana cotta for dessert, and that was definitely sub-par.
Had an espresso, which was Lavazza, with all its pros and cons, but it was actually nicely done.
All in all, a very decent experience for downtown Westmont and a chef that actually tastes his food. Will definitely return."

Small storefront with hip decor and a tiny bar for waiting on a table.  Steady crowd on a Saturday night, and service was friendly.

Lots of pizza choices -- none for gluten-sensitive types, tho, so I couldn&#39;t try one.  Ordered the veal, which our waiter was kind enough to make sure it wasn&#39;t made with flour.  The butter-lemon sauce was delicious, liberally sprinkled with capers, but the meat itself was tough; I needed a steak knife to cut it.  And, the entree came without the asparagus, as described on the menu.  When I pointed this out, a very small dish of asparagus was delivered to the table.  The owner later came around and I told him of my disappointment with the veal dish, and he immediately remedied the situation, with apologies.

Fresh, tasty salads, pasta and appetizer selections, and my friend had compliments for the pizza.  So if you go, be warned that they might not get the entrees right, if they aren&#39;t of the pizza variety."

I hope that it stays forever.  Dolce&#39;s is next to the Westmont Newsstand across from the metra station.  It&#39;s primarily a coffee stop for commuters.  I had time to kill before a train, so I stopped in.  The decor is tres modern, and they even bill themselves as something like a little taste of europe in Westmont.  They are very reminiscent of cafes in Paris or Italy.  Before I talk about the food, I have to tell you about two very impressive features.  As you walk in, where the cream and sugars are, they have a plasma screen running the train schedule.  On the opposite wall, they have a huge display showing a live cam shot of the inbound trains.  It&#39;s awesome.  You can sit comfortably and watch for your train.  
I&#39;m not a coffee drinker, so I opted for a raspberry juice blend (excellent) and a cinnamon roll.  The total was $6.47.  They have soups, sandwiches, and salads, plus an ambitious wine and beer list.  I was sad to see the Brat stop go in Westmont, so maybe this will become my new spot for a drink.
Check them out!"

Dolce&#39;s has to be the most European style cafe/restaurant that I have been too in the United States. The set up of the menu, the decor, and just the overall atmosphere is right out of Europe. 
The pizza alone is to die for. I have been searching for good thin, crispy pizza and have yet to find anything in the city that matches Dolce&#39;s pizza. The sizes are perfect, exactly how one can find in a pizza place in Italy. And the vegetarian is unbelievable. The red peppers were amazing on the pizza. Everything was extremely fresh tasting and grilled perfectly. 
The service was fantastic. It&#39;s the same kind of service one would expect to find in Europe. Basically, if you have been to Europe and have been longing for a hang out that will bring back that nostalgic feeling...Dolce&#39;s is meant for you."

Food-- the waitress told us the menu had been recently updated and we were not disappointed.

Apps were very well done-- fresh in taste as well as presentation. Recommend the goat cheese lemon and thyme tomato soup. Meal-- The New England Shrimp sandwich was great! The remoulade gave the shrimp a nice kick. Desert-- fried Oreos and creme brûlée were very good. One desert feeds about 2 people. 

Bar-- very trendy. Pretty quiet which is nice while maintaining the look like a city bar. Attaches to an outdoor patio with fire.

My last visit I ordered the beet salad and it was great and I ordered the beet salad again for this visit and it was just ok. The calamari was served with a sour cream based sauce and marinara, both are inappropriate for calamari, so that was not enjoyable.
We called the GM over and said we enjoyed the ambiance, our server Elaina was a gem, but the food was just ok. He was cold and not receptive, didn&#39;t apologize or ask how they can make it better, he simply responded with &#34;we&#39;re revamping our entire menu in 2 weeks.&#34; That was it. We went to the patio for a drink (they have a great patio too), and the GM passed us several times without even a smile, knowing we weren&#39;t entirely happy. This would be an opportunity to buy us a drink or at minimum, come chat with us.  Poor customer service attitude from someone in charge of the place!

I made reservations on OpenTable, and everything seemed good. Except they seated us under a freezing air vent. We mentioned it to our server, but we froze during our entire meal. 

Now to the service. Our server was training another new server, but they seemed very preoccupied. We got our water, and wanted to look at the menu. Normally when both of you put your menu down and start to look around, the server should be observant enough to realize you want to order. Both of our servers were all over the place, but never came back down our aisle to check on us. We had to ask another server to get them.

We ordered a salad, and indicated to our server that we were going to share it. When the salad came out there was just one dish, so they had to go get another dish.

I ordered the Petite Filet, which is supposed to be two 4-oz medallions with mashed potatoes and spinach. When it came out the steak looked like it might have been 4 ounces total. I brought this up to the server after flagging him down, and he went to talk to the chef. He came back and said that there is shrinkage, and they were 4-oz before cooking. Now, I know meat, and I know Filet, and I have never seen a Filet shrink by half. I was very disappointed. I&#39;m glad I asked for it to be cooked medium, because it was more like medium well, with hardly no pink in it at all.

The highlight of the meal was the spinach, which I smothered with the Habanero Butter from my wife&#39;s &#34;knife &amp; fork&#34; chicken. It was actually amazing.

My wife already wrote a review, so I will just say the the chicken had way too much breading, and was very dry."

It&#39;s on Ogden Ave. across from parent standard market and it boasts a fairly classy environment. The food honestly in my opinion should&#39;ve been slightly cheaper for what it was because I think the filet was a top sirloin not filet and the 4oz tail is not a sustainable seafood... 

The atmosphere is classy that of a upscale eatery wine bar-esque with dark tones and a decent patio. I really did like the patio with the fireplace. Will definitely go back for that alone. The inside as well was beautiful so I would be more than happy to sit inside as well... 

Our order consisted of a tuna poké as an appetizer and a couple iced teas and lemonades. We didn&#39;t have silverware to begin with and later I had to grab it out of the booth myself... The app was swell with a nice salad and fresh ahi. 

The entree was just the no. 1 surf and turf combo with a 6oz filet and 4oz lobster for 34$. Came with mashed potatoes and sautéed spinach. I ordered Oscar style too which was a crab cake served atop the steak. The steak came out way over done not medium rare but i was brought a new one which was perfect. However it came with butter atop it... Ew. The stuffed baked tater was also good. Little too much butter again but eh. 

Overall the food was Ok nothing to special especially for being owned by standard market, but I enjoyed my dinner and would love to come back for the patio and atmosphere. (Next time I will tell the chef to use NO or less butter)."

We were there this weekend and I don&#39;t know if the manager was out Christmas shopping, but it was not very well organized or managed. Two employees were standing at the front chatting, and another two were at the bar - the nearly empty bar- chatting, while our waitperson was super busy, waiting on at least a half dozen tables by herself. 

I don&#39;t blame her personally (she was trying) but we asked for coffee and one condiment, and it took three requests to get the coffee. Never did get the condiment, and she didn&#39;t ask why half the food was still on my plate - uneaten because apparently asking for a spare kidney would have been simpler than getting condiments or any follow-up after the food drop. 

Both Bakersfield and its parent company seem to, sadly, be slipping in quality. Won&#39;t be making a special trip from the city for this one anymore."

Let me say that I am super sad that this has come to replace Bailey&#39;s, an old Westmont staple (with some pretty good food).  

A few other reviewers talked of &#34;off day&#34; experiences, and maybe that&#39;s what was happening at this place.  I called and they said reservations weren&#39;t necessary, which was clear when we arrived.  They only had ONE prix fixe menu available for Mother&#39;s Day (which they failed to mention on the phone) which was kind of annoying since we were hoping for a larger variety of food to choose from when we picked the place.  

The service was super spotty, which was weird since the place wasn&#39;t busy at all.  Sure, groups coming in for MD were plentiful, but the restaurant wasn&#39;t close to full and we still had a hard time getting our waiter to come to our table just to initially take our order.

The food was OK, though my mom wasn&#39;t too happy with her entree since there were about 20 whole roasted garlic cloves just on the plate with the food when it arrived.  Everyone loves garlic, but that&#39;s just too much.  The MD menu was small and incredibly limited, so I don&#39;t think we were able to give Bakersfield&#39;s menu a real review, but the truncated menu didn&#39;t do it for us on a day that should have been a fun, special day out for some ladies looking for good food and good drinks.

Pretty decent Bloody Mary, though, which makes Bakersfield a possible promising place for late-night drinks.  I&#39;d like to come back on a Friday or Saturday just to check out how busy this place gets, what their normal menu is like, and what the bar/outdoor area are like when there&#39;s actually people around.  Not the best restaurant experience I&#39;ve ever had, but I&#39;d go back to see what everyone else is raving about in terms of food."

My NY strip steak was cooked well, mashed potatoes were tasty, sautéed spinach was just wilted. I also enjoyed the Caesar salad, Brussels sprouts, and Mac and cheese. The brownie with vanilla ice cream was a decadent and delicious way to end the meal. Overall, it&#39;s definitely a great dinner spot for a large meal of classic American food."

The interior is nice and it&#39;s capable of seating a large number of individuals - another plus mark, especially if you&#39;re looking to eat on a busy day or at a time when restaurants all seem full and you don&#39;t want to deal with long wait times.

That said, for the prices I found the food to be only average and the service was sub-par. We were there for nearly two hours. It took forever for our waitress to come back to take our order and it didn&#39;t seem as if her section was overly busy: it wasn&#39;t as if she was tied up with other tables, I simply couldn&#39;t spot her anywhere in the restaurant. Another server ended up taking our check. 

Ultimately, the food was okay albeit a bit pricy for the quality of what was being offered, though I admit my in-person perception of the food was definitely impacted by service and the delays involved. It&#39;s entirely possible I&#39;m not giving the food a fair shot as I was far too irritated with the wait time to put in our order, and the general absenteeism of our waitress."

I will have to say this past time will be our last time dining at this establishment. Terrible service. They just can&#39;t seem to get  steaks cooked right. We talked with the table next to us the gentleman said he ordered his steak medium rare and it arrived to the table medium well. Same thing happened with my husband the last 2 times we ate at bakersfield!!! Let&#39;s not even talk about their brunch ugh what a mess! It&#39;s a complete shame because this is a gorgeous restaurant with so much potential. Things were just starting to get better and they go and change chefs. 2nd time we have been in since the new chef took over. Young chef VERY sloppy. Noone wants to see your underwear while trying to enjoy a steak that&#39;s not even cooked to your liking. He looked VERY disheveled and irritated almost like hes not use to running a kitchen or it was his first time. Last time we weren&#39;t happy we asked to speak to a manager. A man came out in a suit and tie I&#39;m assuming he was the GM? we told him our issues and he basically just made excuses so this time which again will be our last we didn&#39;t even bother to ask for a manager. Very sad because we like the market that is owned by the same company but with fresh thyme, cuputos, marianos &amp; trader Joe&#39;s near by we won&#39;t be shoping there again either."

The first 2 times were fantastic, the food, service and atmosphere. This time the food was quite disappointing.  

The previous visits I had the bone-in pork chop and the salmon. Both were fantastic, as I mentioned before. This time I had the &#39;knife &amp; fork fried chicken&#39;. I don&#39;t like spicy so I passed on the habanero sauce that comes with it.  The chicken was pretty dry, with a lot, I mean a lot of breading.  The mashed potatoes have always been pretty awesome. I got a side of asparagus, and for the most part they were ok. Quite a few spears were thick and pretty woody, so I was only able to eat part of it.  

The service this time was just mediocre. We were seated and then greeted by our 2 waiters, 1 was in training. After we were told the specials and we had our waters, they left. After almost 10 minutes, I asked one of the other waitresses if she could get our waiters. I thanked them for returning. They were pretty attentive though from that point on."

I was a bit hesitate as I read some of yelp friend&#39;s not so great reviews. One of my best Friends loved this place so I followed her for our girls night out. 

The lobby was so cozy for the winter night. The waiter greeted us very nicely. Instead of cocktails, we asked the red wine for the table. It took a while before the waiter came back and told us it was sold out. So we picked another one. Later the waiter come back offered the same brand but 2006 wine instead of 2008 which was we picked. We were happy to accept and it was an awesome bottle.

We got Tuna Poke as appetizer, Sirloin, and lamb shank as entrees to share among three of us. Everything was cooked right. The lamb shank was the best I have tried for a long time. It was better than the lamb shank I got from the Greek town. Very flavorful and tender. 

The dessert, chocolate cheese cake was heavenly to finish up the whole dinner. We were a bit tipsy from the bottle so stayed for a while before go home. Our waiter was a warm happy young man who definitely help us enjoy the dinner more. He checked on us often to make sure we had everything. The manager stopped to say hi as well. 

I guess we were lucky to get a great services. Hope we have the same person which we go back to visit. And they could be a bit slow some time so give yourselves plenty time to dine in."

Then we had the New York strip steak and cheeseburger. The cheese burger was pretty basic for $12. Nothing special but still good. The steak $36 was alright. The mashed potatoes were so plain. It was just a potato with no flavor. No flavor or anything. Salt and pepper did very little to jazz them up. The bill came to about $77. I would not recommend Bakersfield for dinner. Maybe lunch if there is a special going on. It was not worth the price for pretty bland, basic food."

Decided to return for our 34th anniversary last night and what a difference 3yrs make.  The service was lacking and the food was lacking even more.  My husband said his fish was ok, nothing spectacular.  I ordered the grilled meatloaf that came with mashed potatoes and spinach.  When I got my entree it was barely warm so I sent it back.  What I should have done was tell them not to bring it back.  The meatloaf was horrid.  If asked to describe it all that comes to mind is mushy flavorless mystery meat sliced and grilled. Also there is is no way the potatoes were real, they had to have been instant.   The only thing that was good was the Cesar salad I ordered.  As for the waiter, I feel he didn&#39;t come to check on is as much as expected in a nice restaurant and never brought us the basket of bread.  We had to ask someone else to bring the wine we ordered.  Not sure what happened to this restaurant but when the restaurant is more than half empty on a Saturday night at 7:30-8:00 it should be a good indication that I&#39;m not the only one that has been disappointed .  
Too bad a good restaurant went down the drain."

Previous visits might have warranted a better rating but I&#39;ve always felt that this restaurant had more potential than they actually deliver.  

The restaurant is beautiful and they have one of the best outdoor patios in the area - the &#34;locally grown/locally sourced&#34; concept of their menu was somewhat innovative when they first opened but the trend has caught on and is quickly becoming a cliche in my opinion.  

When we arrived with our party of 8 (2 of them children) they attempted to give us a high top table (with backless chairs) on the patio which was immediately declined.  It was a table more conducive to drinks and sharing appetizers.  Had they mentioned that table option when our host made the reservation or when we checked in - we could have explained our preference for a traditional table and avoided the last minute scramble to seat us.    

Their wine list is fairly extensive - a Riesling was selected by our host and it was very nice.  When we ordered a second bottle, the server brought it to her, with the screw top unopened and gave it to her to open and pour - never ever had that experience in a restaurant of this caliber before.  Our server was very sweet but not nearly as attentive or efficient as we&#39;ve had a Bakersfield before - I got the impression she was new.  

I would say that Bakersfield does meat better than anything on their menu.  On the occasions that we&#39;ve had a filet or chops - we&#39;ve enjoyed the food the most.  Last night we tried the Spring Gnocchi, Knife &amp; Fork Chicken, Sea Bass and two others in our party had Filet.  The gnocchi in my dish was airy and light - not the least bit dense or doughy but they smothered it in what should have been a light pomodoro sauce that was actually pasty, clumpy and overcooked.  You could count the pieces of asparagus in it - it actually had more snow peas in it, which weren&#39;t even mentioned on the menu description, so I think they were supplementing.  

The Sea Bass was part of the &#34;3 for $33&#34; special they were offering and when it arrived, my husband asked me to taste it...it was obvious the fish wasn&#39;t fresh and may have been frozen a bit too long as it was extremely fishy.  He orders Sea Bass frequently when it&#39;s available and knows the difference between a good piece of fish and a bad one and this one was not good.  We told the manager and he promptly apologized and replaced his entree with Grilled Ahi Tuna which he really enjoyed.  

Bakersfield as a lot going for it but is located in an area that gives diners choices like Gibson&#39;s, Perry&#39;s, and Wildfire, so they need to step up their game if they want to compete.  Both the dining room and patio were not at all crowded on a beautiful Saturday evening (compared to the crowds they used to draw when they first opened), probably an ominous sign that they have some work to do."

The physical space is my favorite for miles around -- elegant, with private tables/booths where you never hear the adjacent customers, yet casual and unpretentious.  The food was originally excellent and innovative. Service has always been a bit hit or miss; I&#39;ve never had awful servers, but they&#39;ve become consistently less attentive.  

The menu and kitchen leadership are in desperate need of a reboot.  Their signature dishes are no longer prepared the way the original chef envisioned them.  For example, the knife-and-fork fried chicken used to be chopped in an unconventional way that made it easy to eat if you didn&#39;t want to get greasy fingers.  Now it&#39;s just another cut, and the breading has lost its pizzazz.  Even the cornbread crouton now seems less like a crouton and more like just a stale hunk of cornbread.  The food and experience aren&#39;t bad, they just show a frustrating lack of care -- there&#39;s no evidence of passion by anyone in the establishment, starting with whoever is responsible for the menu.

The parent Standard Market has not slipped, IMO, contrary to at least one other review here.  But they seem not to be paying attention to their fading gem right across Ogden.  Our region is full of creative young chefs and restaurant managers looking to make names for themselves.  Hire a few and set them up to innovate for success."

The menu selection was not large but decent to suit most people. I order Knuckle Sandwich with a side of salad. At first, I inteded not to eat the bread because I was watching my carb intake, but I tried a bite. Butterly and crispy from outside but soft inside, the bread complimented well the lobster filling. The side salad tasted great with fresh vegetables.

I had to get up on two separate occasions to get ketchup and to get refills on our drinks.  The second time I spoke to another person who told me that she had the server working both areas.  At no time to I get an apology for the poor service.  If I wanted to get up all the time I would have stayed home. When I left they had the nerve to say have a good day.

The food here is very similar to standard market grill--probably because they&#39;re affiliated---so I was expecting a higher quality of food--and they delivered...definitely a fab variety of food.

The portions for most everything we had was ginormous and definitely shareable--in fact I advise that you share everything to try all the different flavors.

We had the Tuna Poke, Four Farmers Salad, New York Strip Steak, Majestic Pork Chop, Brussel Sprouts, variety of kids meals, and all of the desserts---

I know don&#39;t judge--the group I was with definitely loves their sweets.

The tuna poke was very fresh and had a wonderful citrus asian flavor.  The farmers salad was huge and all the flavors went together very well---at first I wasn&#39;t so sure about the fig and hazelnuts and goat cheese--but it was fantastic!

The steak and pork were cooked perfectly---I&#39;m generally not a huge fan of brussel sprouts but these were cooked very well--they were a little charred and had a little cheese so that made it super yummy!  The kids meals were all HUGE too--some had hot dogs, cheese burgers, grilled cheese---and they all had enough to take home for another meal.

On to the desserts---I think everyone had a mini joygasm from the fried oreos---the hazelnut cheesecake was very rich and tasted like a block of nutella---which isn&#39;t bad by any stretch of the imagination, the creme brûlée was tasty but similar to other ones that we&#39;ve had, and the key lime tart, while it looked very pretty, wasn&#39;t anything special.

Overall we had a good experience will be back."

The good (keep doing!)
Excellent free valet
Beautiful restaurant and a West Coast outdoor patio
Good steaks and chicken

The not so good:
First impression - inexperienced hostesses at the door. I&#39;ll leave it at that.
Food was just OK - not worth the price.  Hate restaurants that fill plates with mashed potatoes to hold down cost. All the dishes seem to have them included. 
$10 Mocha martini for dessert - take it off the menu if it can&#39;t be done right. It was watery so I sent it back.  The server took it away as if she knew it was bad and offered to try to fix it.  We received a martini with chocolate sauce added.  I gave up.
Ladies room - alerted staff it needed attention. Water on floor and generally needed to be cleaned.

Chef Cassata - I hate writing negative reviews and tried to find an email address for you.  You have a great location and a lot of potential.  Where was the manager to provide feedback to the staff? I dine out regularly and left a 20% tip but didn&#39;t feel good about it.

Growing up in California, that has a whole different meaning. I&#39;m glad I pushed aside those memories for the ones made tonight.

While the food, wine and atmosphere were excellent, what really makes me write this review is due to our server, Sean. He knew the menu and could make some knowledgeable recommendation. He found us a nice bottle of Cab my coworker and I liked, and we both had the Mexican soup.

My friend ordered the bacon-wrapped shrimp that were the size of prawns, while I opted for the fresh Cajun Trout. One word: phenomenal!  We couldn&#39;t just leave it at that, so we took the plunge and went for dessert, too. My friend had the fried Oreos. They looked like cream puffs, and I tried one, and it didn&#39;t taste as sweet as you&#39;d think. I chose the &#34;healthier&#34; route and went for the nectarines and berries. They were drizzled with balsamic vinegar and it was the best!

Because of our experience, I asked our server to send over the manager. I should have told him why, because I think he was a bit nervous. But we told the manager we were very pleased with our meal, but mostly, very happy to have Sean as our server. Be sure to ask for him and you&#39;ll be ensured you have a great time!"

Showed up on Labor Day for the RSVP, and while every light was on inside, outside, over every table and in the kitchen- the place was closed and locked up tight as a drum. 

Called their phone, message still said &#34;we are open Sunday and Monday&#34;.....

Had to take friends elsewhere thanks to Bakersfield. 

From the issues I&#39;ve heard going on at this place from other patrons- they have a serious lack of management oversight. Good food, bad service / front house."

Service is excellent and it&#39;s a very nice looking restaurant. I thought the food was just OK. We each ordered the lunch wood-fired grill salmon, which came with mashed potatoes and the spinach side. The salmon was cooked well but was very bland. Everything actually was very bland, and the 2 sides were not very warm. We also ordered a mac &amp; cheese side to share, and it was also very bland. It was a decent size side, which is nice for sharing, but really just noodles and cheese and the cheese was not a very strong flavor. The only thing that I can see was really excellent was the Fried Oreo for dessert. Very good! I&#39;ll probably give them another try, but for the price you pay there, I&#39;ll go north on 83 and hit up J. Alexanders for my salmon in the future."

I&#39;ve been hearing great reviews about this place for quite some time so I was excited to try it. 

I ended up with the Prime Rib French Dip and I thought it was outstanding. The meat was nice and rare while the au jus wasn&#39;t a big salt-bomb. Really, really good. 

We didn&#39;t drink, but the bar looked okay. My only gripe is that everything on the menu seemed just slightly too expensive.

We were entertaining another couple and were embarrassed at the poor service which was distracting and disrupted the pace of our meal. My husband had to get up 3 times to go and get the server&#39;s attention: once for a forgotten salad, another time for a water refill and again to obtain the check. The restaurant was not crowded and the server seemed to have forgotten about us. My guest&#39;s tenderloin sliders were so dry she needed to request au jus from the french dip entree to dip her sandwiches in. I had the knife and fork chicken which was about 25% inedible due to gristle. I would not go back but for the fact that I have a balance remaining on a gift card."

Everything was wonderful. I wish the experience we had last Friday night was the first experience we ever had. 

The food was so delicious. We started with the tuna poke and the shrimp wraps. Both were awesome and I would highly recommend ordering them. 

For dinner I got the halibut and a side of Brussels sprouts. As a kid I never wanted to eat brussel sprouts and after eating these I&#39;m not sure why. The fish was cooked perfectly. It also came with a rather large Portobello mushroom. I hate mushrooms. With a passion. If I knew it came with one I would have deff asked for something else. BUT. My view on mushrooms has changed. I freaking loved it. The fact that this place can turn a mushroom hater into a lover shows something. 

My fiance got the Pork chop which was their special that night and it was very tender and he loved every bite of it. The sweet potato fries he got on the side were also the bomb. 

My Mother in law to be got the filet and loved it as well. Sarah my to be sister got the knife and fork fried chicken and said it was amazing. 

We finished the night with fried oreos and the vanilla crumbulee. The fried oreos were to die for. Get them. Its worth the extra calories. You should deffinetly save room for them. 

No doubt the food was outstanding, but so was our server Brian. He knew all about the food and could describe it in detail. He was one of the best servers I&#39;ve ever had. When making a reservation, request him. You won&#39;t be disappointed. Ill say it again, I wish he was our server the first time, he was perfect. Took away all the dishes and what I really loved was how he kept the table spotless. I was impressed that he wiped off the table inbetween meal courses. Even the managers showed great service. Patrick came by to stop by our table to make sure everything was going perfect a few times. Surely an awesome guy. Ben, another manager as well came to check on everything  (super awesome guy who I know from my current job). They were both great &amp; glad to be in company of them. 

I hope the service I received that night is the service that everyone gets when they walk through the front door. From the valet opening the door, the friendly host, the knowledgeable server, &amp; the management team checking on tables. Thats the service I expect when dining at Bakersfield. Thats what makes this place outstanding. The food means absolutely nothing when the service is not on key. I wish Bakersfield the best of luck. I will most deffinetly be back again."

So we tried this place again. Let me tell you it was a totally different experience this time around. Our server Leeza (Hope her name was spelt correct) was very nice. She told us about the special of the day. She was also very knowable of everything on the menu. This time we got butter with our buns. The food was totally  delicious.

Absolutely NO CHANGE.

This time, instead of being with women of a certain age, I was with my husband and adult son.

Once again, I had to ask for ice and a straw.  This time the straw arrived bent and misshapen with the packaging looking like it had been through the postal service sorting machines.  The permanent crease did not prevent the water from reaching the top, fortunately.  During our meal, the other 2 glasses were replenished twice by our server and once by another server ~ but not one new drop of water was ever poured into my glass.  I guess if you have ice, you are expected to suck on that.

If fries are selected as a side, why not just ask, RIGHT, THEN AND THERE, if you would like ketchup for them.  Or better yet, just bring the darn ketchup.  Save yourself a trip.

We sat on the side to the right of the hostess stand ~ VERY loud with waaaaaaaaaaay too much traffic.  I strongly recommend you sit on the bar side if you want to have a friendly conversation with your dining partners.

So glad this experience was on the house."

We did have one visit when the service was awful, (think three hours plus for dinner) but that was just one experience.  I have had several great experiences including this past Easter.  

Brunch was delicious.  I ordered the Quiche Lorraine, My mom had the smoked salmon and my boyfriend had the chorizo quesadillas.  Everything was great.  My only complaint is that they advertised breakfast pastries to be served and there were none available.  Whatvs.  Not a huge deal.  

Bakersfield is also BYOB when you purchase your wine at the Standard Market across the street.  Just be sure to bring in your receipt.  

They also have a really great patio.  Perfect for drinks and apps."

I got an Old Fashioned.  They use proper Maraschino cherries in the drink, which is definitely appreciated.  The drink was balanced and delicious, without being sweet or imbalanced in any way.

The surf &amp; turf was a good, solid choice.  The lobster in particular was very well prepared.

Dessert?  You can&#39;t go wrong.  My table picked about 4 and passed them around.  Every offering was delicious.

I like the spinach dip and the knuckle sandwich was just like have a lobster roll in maine. It was light and cold, not over season, with little mayo cole slaw on a really nice hot butter bun. The french onion soup, I was just not a fan. It was super sweet and the bread had cheese but it was really cold so the rest of the soup got cooler fast. I like onion but  it was 99% onion with 1% broth. It really had to do with my taste buds."

So this is one our usual go-to spots.  Always good meals, warm service and we have sent many people there.  Fast forward to last night, 3/17/15--Yes St Pat&#39;s and they advertised Corned Beef and Cabbage.  So made an Open table reservation for 6:30 and invited our son and daughter in law....Get there and sit at the bar for a few minutes and finally asked to be seated since bartender (?Stephanie) seemed ready to kill anyone in sight!!!!  As we are being seated 6:40PM asked hostess if they had the desired corned beef and cabbage and told, &#34;Yes we Do!&#34;  Few minutes later server comes and no CB&amp;C!  &#34;they ran out&#34;  Not apologetic at all and no suggestions.  So we re-couped and ordered other meals.  I got ribs which I have had before and they were awful.  Overcooked and dried out. Server never asked if I wanted full or half slab--just brought me what she wanted.  Other 3 meals were mediocre at best.

Only saw one server we recognized, so all new staff and did not recognize manager. 
Will probably give them another shot but really an inferior experience compared the prior 20 or so.....bad night?  Maybe, or maybe not...."

And each time Bakerfield has done a great job with the food, drinks and the service.

First of all, the drinks.  For this martini lovin&#39; girl- I am a bit picky about my martini&#39;s but this place does them right and the first time out. Since I like mine &#34;Very dirty&#34; many bartenders are a little afraid of how dirty to make them.  Not such the case here.  Rich (I think that was his name) pours a great drink no matter what he is pouring and everyone at the table agreed!

As for the food- some of my appetizer favorites include- the taco quatro, tuna poke, and crispy Thai shrimp.  Off their sandwich menu- I liked the knuckle sandwich (lobster), the french dip and the Cheeseburger.  And for dinner- the ribs won me over but my friend raves about the prime rib.

The interior is contemporary and naturally lit.  There is a liberal use of wood with both tables and booths.  The bar on the south end of the restaurant is open and a good place to mingle after work. It also has a couple of TV&#39;s so if it&#39;s a game you want to watch you won&#39;t be disappointed.  And that patio is terrific as there is little else on Ogden like it with the clustered seating areas, fire places and heated umbrellas to extend the season.  There is one communal table out there perfect for your large group to sit and linger awhile.

On all of my visits the service has been terrific.  The servers run the food as well as bus their own tables but it is really nice to see the team work between the servers as they help each other out.  I did find the quantity of hostesses a little odd (I think on my last visit there were 5 of them) but as long as I am seated promptly I really don&#39;t care.

The only drawback for me is how they handle the wine.  If you order a bottle they don&#39;t open it at the table but back at the &#34;wine bar&#34; located at the north end of the restaurant.  When I asked why this was- they said that it &#34;expedited service&#34;.  Maybe.  But I like to see my wine opened in front of me.  On my next visit I did ask for it to be opened at the table and after some hesitation by the server, he did agree to do so.

Bakersfield is owned by the same people who own the Standard Market across the street.  It&#39;s named after the owners home town of Bakerfield California.  It is an ambitious venture and one that I think is going to be successful as it really appeals to everyone- families, seniors and people just out to have a nice dinner in the area.

There is complimentary valet parking- but if you don&#39;t want to use it- you can also park in the spacious lot in the back.

If you are in the area and want a slightly different take on American food- give Bakerfield a try.  I think you&#39;ll be pleasantly surprised at what you find behind it&#39;s unassuming exterior!"

So yes, we did come in on a Saturday night without a reservation.  But we could sit at the full-service bar without a wait - excellent.  We did that.

Service was a bit off and maybe that was because it was so busy.  I kind of felt like we were bothering people by being there, especially at first.  We got our drink orders in and then it took a few minutes to get food ordered - there were other people eating at the bar so I&#39;m not sure why it felt odd that we were doing the same.  I kind of felt like the two people working the bar were acting not quite as they should in front of customers in terms of tone and behavior with each other, which I haven&#39;t experienced anywhere in a while.

The food was average to better than average - I tried the Knuckle Sandwich, and it maybe could have used a little seasoning but the lobster was pretty tasty inside the bread.  My fries were pretty soggy, though since they were thin-cut, that seems easy to do, IMO.  So had the prime rib with a bone marrow crust on it.  He thought it was a little over-salted but the piece I tried was pretty good, with a nice, rich flavor.  That came with a DIY baked potato, which he liked a lot - a platter of toppings and a whole lot of butter to load it up with.  And then last was the hazelnut chocolate cheesecake.  It was enormous and not overly sweet, which was nice.  Definitely made for sharing.

After discussing with a friend, we thought the prices might be slightly elevated for the portions - I thought the prime rib was appropriate but there was a but of a gap on some of the other items.  If the prices are the same on the lunch menu, it can get expensive fast.

I&#39;ll probably give it another go to see what sitting in an actual table is like.  I love Standard Market and want to support the company but this one left me a little off."

Lots of variety and everything is delicious. I tried the prime rib, the grilled trout, the Asian steak salad, and the fried chicken. All of which were fantastic. I suggest the Asian steak salad or the trout for a lighter meal. 
However, the desserts were by far the best part about this place. I don&#39;t know who would have thought to fry Oreos, but whoever did has my eternal thanks. I am itching to look for a recipe to try, but I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll be able to make anything that delicious. The apple cobbler was also delicious and is worth trying if you are looking for a more traditional dessert. 
This restaurant is definitely worth trying."

Bakersfield called and confirmed the reservation and noted that it was for a birthday. One would think that meant they would do something even if it were only to say happy birthday but not at Bakersfield, not today.

Our waitress was excellent, she recommended that our appetizer arrive before she submitted the rest of our order so that the food wouldn&#39;t come all at once. She was attentive and not overly so.

We started with drinks. I got a pineapple martini which was ok until I ate what was the pineapple, a disgusting rubbery gummy bear? My partner was barely able to drink what he ordered. In his words, at least it has alcohol in it. His drink had gummy bears too. Maybe we&#39;re not up on current drinks but I would save gummy bears for kids.

We had two appatizers.  The Blue Crab Dip was excellent while the Pot Roast Stickers were slightly better than frozen egg rolls.

We each had dinner salads which were above average for a restaurant where you&#39;ll be spending this kind of money.

We had the salmon which was tasty for me but not so much for my partner as they do not season the salmon. To their credit the menu does say its not seasoned.

For desert we had fried Oreos which were ok but nothing special."

I am willing to try it again in the future and I&#39;ll update my review. 
There is complimentary valet which is nice. We had reservations on a Saturday night and had to wait 15 min past our time. We requested a booth when we called but were not provided with one.
For appetizer we ordered house salad in this amazing champagne dressing with cornbread croutons but got the lobster bisque which was bland and needed more cream or chunks of actual lobster.
For main meal I got pot roasted chicken which was okay but Brussels sprouts on the side were delicious, but a little too burnt. My bf got grilled tuna steak which he kept raving about in this BBQ soy vinaigrette which paired well.
For dessert got cappuccinos which were
good but got a chocolate zabaglione cream cake that was dry and tasted like it had been siting around.
Service from bartender and bus boys was as expected. Our waiter did not check up on is often. A manager came by and we sent back a soup that we didn&#39;t like and it felt like the waiter was holding a grudge the rest of the night- he rarely came by or said anything. They did give us the appetizer we replaced it with for free which was nice. Waiter dropped off check before asking if we wanted anything else which was his loss because we did. Oh well."

The quality of food here is three steps ahead of just about anywhere else you can eat in the area. There are places where you can get good food OR good service OR a cool ambiance OR great drinks OR a nice crowd, but there are few where you can get all of these things and I think Bakersfield is it.

I&#39;ve tried a lot of the menu here, almost all of the salads, a couple desserts, a couple cocktails, almost all of the appetizers, burgers, chicken, tuna...I haven&#39;t met a dish I wouldn&#39;t absolutely eat again (except for one cocktail, which I later ordered at a different restaurant and it turns out I don&#39;t want cucumbers anywhere near my cocktails--so not Bakersfield&#39;s fault there).

It is more expensive than most options in the area, too. However, I think this level of quality of food is sometimes hard to find in Hinsdale-Clarendon Hills-Westmont and absolutely worth the higher prices. If you want food of this quality in the city, you will be paying at least as much for it (not including your traveling/parking/valet/higher drink prices).

Standouts to me are the fried chicken with the cornbread (that cornbread is amazing), the Four Farmer&#39;s Salad (my absolute favorite), and the dessert that comes in the terrarium (it&#39;s a flavor explosion in your mouth--plus I&#39;m pretty sure there were real flower petals in there).

Bakersfield is on the top of my list when I visit home."

We ordered the calamari and the fork and knife chicken and a cup of soup (Chicken tortilla). The calamari was incredibly thin. I even disassembled 1 ring because I couldn&#39;t believe there was a piece of meat in it. Along with that the batter was very bland and I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s the oil being used; but the dish lacked in seasoning and simply put flavor. We sent it back and it was kindly removed from our tab. The soup was great but honestly I would hope that would be decent at what appears to be a fine dining establishment. Lastly, the chicken appeared to be fried nicely until cut into and tons of oil spilled out of it. The same bland, cardboard flavored batter was on the chicken and the potatoes mirrored the same desperate need for seasoning. Chicken is usually the &#34;safest&#34; meat at a restaurant so it was quite disappointing when I know bars with better fry jobs.  

I read a lot of good reviews so I was highly disappointed in my dining experience. I&#39;m not sure if it was the time or the dishes but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be giving them a repeat performance. Shame since the service, decor and overall ambience was great."

Apparently some of the start up wrinkles have been ironed out, because the two hostesses were welcoming and focused.  Service was quite good and always pleasant.  The food was very well prepared - pork chop cooked right with a side of Asian vegetables cooked al dente and with an intriguing sauce.  The loaded baked potato was, well, big and loaded.  

My companion, a salad aficionado, liked the house salad with its dark greens, corn bread croutons, heirloom tomatoes, etc.  She&#39;s not normally one to eat croutons, but these went down easily.  She found the gnocchi and meatballs to be perfectly satisfying. The decaffeinated coffee had a nice flavor but was rather weak.  We are not drinkers and cannot report on the wine selections.   

Bakersfield seem to have anything that the upper middle class diner seeking a traditional menu could ask for."

I am withholding one star because last Friday night we were trying to have just that (dinner for two). Unfortunately,  the sound of the game on multiple TVs was blasting all over the place, so that it was virtually impossible to have a conversation. Make up your mind, people.

We went here last April for my mother&#39;s birthday and had a great meal all around. We came for dinner, loved the taco appetizer, four farmers salad, steaks, etc.

We came back here January 5th for my father&#39;s birthday and had a different experience. We came for lunch, maybe that&#39;s the issue...who knows. Four farmers salad did not seem as good-little to NO avocado or goat cheese in either of them, bloody mary&#39;s tasted NOT right, mostaciolli was AWFUL-it even smelled weird. Prime rib sandwich and fries were good, but that&#39;s about it. Waitress was not as attentive as we would have liked, esp. since we were 1 of 2 tables there (big snow storm). They also changed the taco appetizer and now it&#39;s just all chicken-no shrimp or fish option-so that stunk. 

We were not impressed and my mom stated she would not be back. Plenty of other great restaurants in the area!"

I noticed that there are many reviews that think it&#39;s over priced. I&#39;m going to disagree. We&#39;re talking made from scratch, high quality ingredients. You get what you pay for.

I was starving when I got to the restaurant; I was seated very quickly.
I think it was 3pm when I arrived; upon asking the waitress if there were any lunch specials, she looked at her watch &amp; said, &#34;Sorry, they ended.&#34;  Boo.

Dinner menu &amp; prices it was.  Prices were reasonable...I was just salty at myself for missing my lunch special window (and because I was so hungry I could gnaw someone&#39;s arm off).

I ordered the basil fried rice with tofu (choices were beef, chicken or tofu while octopus &amp; shrimp were extra).  On the menu, it had a red chili pepper next to it, which meant some heat would be added to the dish (yes!)...unfortunately, the heat stayed in the kitchen.  I guess I should&#39;ve told the waitress I wanted a spicy platter of basil fried rice (never assume anything in life...even if there&#39;s a red chili pepper next to it).

I also got myself a bottle of Chang beer, which was a Taiwanese lager (don&#39;t judge my need to quench my thirst for beer at 3pm on a sunshiny, hot Wednesday).  The beer came with a frosty mug for $4.50; not bad...pretty effervescent &amp; not a bad taste.  Would I get another?  Probably not.  Ever.

The waitress was nice and attentive (no one else was there, so that could be why).  She refilled my water and asked how everything tasted.
The taste!  How could I forget to write about the taste!?! 
The tofu basil fried rice was 5 stars for sure.  It was a giant plate (could&#39;ve fed 2) of veggies, rice and tofu galore.  Hey that rhymes!  Maybe poetry is in my near future....but, I digress.  That shall happen...nevermore. 

I think I drank too much wine before this review.

All in all, Yum Yum Thai was a quaint, clean, delicious place to satiate my hunger pains.  I will go there again when I&#39;m in the area."

The lunch special comes with a salad (if that&#39;s what you call a few pieces of lettuce), soup and an appetizer.  The eggroll was one cut in half.  A previous reviewer commented that they were cheap - that appears to be correct. 

Regarding the food:  The presentation was great but the taste was sub-par.  The basil beef had about two leaves of basil and no flavor, even though I ordered it &#34;spicy&#34;.  I love authentic Thai basil dishes, but there was no basil taste in this dish at all.

I still prefer Somsri in Winfield or Montri Thai in Warrenville."

My pad thai was very good, and my bf said his dish was good also. The portions were generous and the food was very flavorful. I would recommend this for local thai food. My only complaints are that it was too cold in there, I ate with my jacket on, and after our food was served the waitress never checked up on us.

Waited until third visit to review. Went 3 times over 3 weeks and absolutely love this place.

The food is spot on, never had a bad or even questionable dish. With my intrepid dining bandits, we ran through most of the menu from appies to dessert. Everything is super fresh, great fish, chicken, veggies. Really nicely done curries, soups bigger than your head (seriously, entree sized soups) desserts I&#39;m tempted to say are terrible just so you won&#39;t order them and I can have more. I get the impression it is a small kitchen and each order is done from scratch....

That&#39;s the food. Service, as noted elsewhere on these pages, can be erratic. But I say that in a friendly, nice kind of way. Is it Gibsons, Spiaggia or Alinea with snap to it tableside fawning ? No, its a small strip mall locally owned Thai spot that churns out awesome food by really friendly people who craft great food. Not sure whats up over there, but witnessed/overheard a couple of super douche-y parties...maybe Thai attracts complainers or perhaps its the proximity to White Eagle. Just this Saturday night one party of six had them reconfigure the bar area, set up seating for drunk dad, bitchy mom and the ipad toting, doll dragging, crayon crushing brood and then left in less than 5 minutes in the middle of Saturday night slam/takeout rush hour because their water didn&#39;t come fast enough and no one took their cocktail order. 

Its a definite winner and will definitely be in the mongoose rotation.  The motto of the mongoose family is: run and find out for yourself. The food rocks!!"

The restaurant itself is decorated nicely, the staff is attentive and chatty, and I would imagine it has a nice vibe for dinner. I had pot stickers, salad, red curry and a Thai iced tea. All of it was delicious but the one thing that I was surprised about was that my Thai iced tea was served with whipped cream and chocolate sauce on top?

- Go. But go with low expectations for good service. They&#39;re not mean, just not on top of things.  

- Go when you have plenty of time and make sure you either:
a) Like the people you&#39;re going with so you can engage in lengthy, entertaining conversations full of belly laughs, tears of joy, bittersweet memories and soul searching
b) Bring your Kindle

- If you get the chicken wing appetizer, the wings come in a tiny ceramic boat! No shit, a boat! Plus they&#39;re really good; crispy with a sweet chili sauce to dip. ."

So the boy&#39;s bff hit us up for dinner and wanted Thai.  The 4 of us (the boys and their girls) head over for some YUM YUM! They&#39;ve been there once before, but we have not... We should&#39;ve found this place before now!  We&#39;ll definitely be back, no doubt about that!

So we start out with 2 apps... Pot Stickers with sesame soy sauce &amp; Chicken Satay with peanut sauce and cucumber salad.  They were both good, but the part that stood out was the sauces!  I honestly tried to lick the bowls (I did for the peanut sauce... we&#39;ll just leave it at that...)!

I have the Pad Thai with beef.  I really tried to order something different since this is my go to Thai dish, but I&#39;m so glad I didn&#39;t!!!  The beef had this smokey grilled flavor that ran through the entire dish!  It made everything around us smell so amazing!  The flavor was to die for!  I will say that this was the best Pad Thai I&#39;ve had anywhere yet!

The boy had Curry Roast Duck with rice.  He really enjoyed this dish!  The duck was cooked perfectly.  The curry was just the right amount of spicy.  The boy doesn&#39;t eat many veggies, so I got all of the green beans that were picked out of the dish.  I agreed that this dish was done very well!

The boy&#39;s bff got the Basil Leaves Dish with duck.  This boy is obsessed with Sriracha... He loves all things spicy and extra spicy!  He put extra spicy on this dish and it was just right for him!  He loved every moment of this dish with it&#39;s basil and he spicy additive! 

The boy&#39;s bff&#39;s girl (ya follow?) got the Basil Fried Rice with chicken.  Their fried rices look really good!  The basil adds such a great flavor to this dish!  There are also some great veggies in here that you don&#39;t normally get in a fried rice.  It&#39;s a really refreshing idea over the boring stuff you usually see!

The service was good, even a little overwhelming and attentive!  We will definitely be back again soon!"

We had a great experience about a month ago, but last week they really failed.  Our waitress seemed to be very inexperienced. 

One of the dishes was burned  but she served it anyway - she should have had the knowledge to not do that.  The burned smell preceded the dish by at least 5 feet and I&#39;ve never had carrots delivered black like that before. 

The waitress seemed to be overwhelmed and caring even though there were very few people there at the time.  We think this attitude comes down from the top.

We asked for a replacement dish and that too came back just slightly burned but we were hungry and were able to eat it.  We tried to talk about it with the manager but she did not want to listen, she was confident that the dishes were prepared the way they should be.

It took too long to get water glasses refilled, to get our check, etc..

We won&#39;t return.  They&#39;ve had enough chances that it is clear what their problems are and also that they are not going to address them. Almost every restaurant deserves a second chance, but after the tenth chance it&#39;s time to say enough is enough. 

It all boils down to:  Inconsistent performance due to owner attitude and skill level.

&#34;Lemon Grass Thai Cuisine&#34; on Ogden near River Road is better. Even though it&#39;s small and unsophisticated, the food and service are consistently good."

She had gone a couple times for lunch and liked it. Sounds like a great deal for lunch.  Crab Rangoon was very good, light wrapper and delicious filling.  Spring rolls not so good, heavy wrapper and mostly all tofu. Specialty drinks were good and fair price, if they have what you actually want. Out of mojito&#39;s at 5:30 pm on Saturday night. Food wasn&#39;t bad, if you get what you ordered.  My dish had no spice to it all, despite the notation indicating it to be a spicy dish on the menu, besides for being a Thai restaurant.  That is fixable with garnish on table, however it also had no basil as advertised.  Not exactly sure what I got, and after some marginal service at best, they tried to fix by throwing a ton of basil in it, but still no typical Thai spice.  Ordered a couple glasses of house wine, which the waiter said nothing about being out, and apparently brought us another wine instead. To our surprise however, the bill reflected the up-charge for the wine he took the liberty of picking for us.  Overall, seemed like a decent place, but as other reviews indicate, ownership and staff are apparently cutting costs and corners, so beware.  Disappointing, as I had high hopes for the place which is in a great location for us and the prices seemed reasonable.  I guess you get what you pay for."

Pretty standard as far as thai food goes (of course that means large portions), so I guess it just depends on how you like the way they make your favorite dishes.

The satay peanut sauce was excellent, the spring rolls were fresh, and the curry had a great mix of flavors.  The food was ready on time and well presented.  The owner was very sweet and kind.  I could not give it a full 5 stars because the chicken itself for the satay could have used a little more seasoning/salt and parts of the pad thai were a little heavy on the fish sauce.  But overall, I would recommend to a friend and I plan on eating here once a week now since this is my new Thai go to place. :)"

The food is good, and reasonably priced. Lunch specials include soup, small salad, and side such as spring roll, or crab Rangoon. Soup is nicely seasoned without being heavy-handed. A good value.

The service is another thing altogether. Every time we visit for lunch, there is only one server. She may be the owner. Yum Yum is not a huge place, and the service is always riduculously slow. Even when its not excessively crowded, we end up waiting. And waiting..........                          ......And waiting.

Oh, and if you enjoy a nice ice tea with lunch, be warned: it&#39;s not fresh brewed. It&#39;s from powder concentrate, spooned out of a canister."

Only down side is both times we had young inexperienced waiters.

Went there on a Sunday with two families. Decor was nice.  We ordered a bunch of smoothies and Thai ice coffee and the smoothies came almost at the end of our meal and were not made with fresh fruit.  It also  seemed like they weren&#39;t using a commercial blender because there were too many big ice chunks. We ordered appetizers (fried tofu, fried pot stickers, tempura, spring rolls, chicken satay). The appetizers were good but the tempura had too much oil...I know tempura has oil but this was too much.  The chicken pad thai had really sticky noodles and we didn&#39;t care for it. The beef with oyster sauce was ok. The chicken lard nar was tasty.  The shrimp curry was also tasty with just enough spice. The beef pad see yui had too much sauce and I didn&#39;t think the wide noodles were cooked enough. The garlic chicken was good and probably my favorite. The service was ok. Only one waiter who was nice but he didn&#39;t talk much and was not able to find time to make our smoothies until the very end.  We found out he was the owner and I felt like telling him not to be cheap and hire more wait staff.  I would have actually given 4 stars for food and affordability if it weren&#39;t for the service and wait time for the food and smoothies which definitely brought it down to 3 stars."

Our first 2 minutes in the restaurant set the tone for the entire visit.  We weren&#39;t greeted immediately, but some what soon by a pleasant man who said follow me to your table.  After 15 feet he halts at a couple and hands them a drink menu and tell them that there are no drinks tonight because his wife isn&#39;t there to make them, he then wanders off to the kitchen leaving us stranded as if we are suppose to just pick a table...  we did and it was very, very awkward.

And the service continued to be very awkward.  It felt like they were short-staffed and he was filling in even though he had never waited tables before.  His phrasing of things to us and overheard from other tables was downright cringe-worthy.  But don&#39;t get me wrong, he was very polite and well-intentioned.  It felt like the whole restaurant was in disarray, and I was bracing for a 2 hour &#34;dining experience&#34;.

Let me stop here and say the food was fantastic and timely.  I had the calimari which was done up in a tempura batter which also had some battered strips of red peppers.  The sauce was quite standard but I really enjoyed the appetizer.  For the main dish I had the catfish in curry sauce,  Some of the fish bits were a bit over fried and felt a bit unproportioned ratio wise to the vegetables.  But the vegetables were perfectly cut and stellar,  I&#39;m not even sure what it all was but it was more than your standard selection.  It was also a large portion and was just as good reheated.

The decorating of the place was also great and its obvious they did not skimp on the look of the place, but the devil is in the details...  Our table rocked like crazy,  the daily specials plastic sleeve was completely crusted in kitchen grease and the bar top was covered with about 50 dirty drink glasses.

I want to hope this was just an off day for Yum Yum,  we will certainly be back and 2nd impressions will make this either a 2 or 4 star review."

I ordered the spring rolls and pad Thai with chicken. Both were excellent and the portions huge. The spring rolls are fresh and filled with crunchy veges, not fried and there&#39;s some sort of dipping sauce. I managed to carefully eat most of them on my way home. Did I mention it was a late lunch? 
I attacked the pad Thai when I got home and it was so good...truly authentic. I&#39;ve had excellent pad Thai in the city but this is the first in the burbs.

I have frequented Yum Yum Thai enough to know if you&#39;re the only customer in there, you might get good service. If there&#39;s more than 2 tables, you are SOL. 
Dear Yum Yum, one person cannot run the dining room at lunch time. How does one person greet, take orders, answer the phone, and deliver my food? Wake up, and hire someone to help out!
The food is about 3 stars if you care to be ignored forever. I can&#39;t take it any more. I see empty glasses that need more water and tea, people that sit down, get up and leave because nobody says hi to them, people  looking around for their food, and people looking around so they can get their check. Also, i see people walk in for carryout and ask me if anyone is working here. Do you see this? Methinks no, because you&#39;re in the kitchen trying to keep up.

I always get the tofu pad thai which is delicious...when it&#39;s cooked right.  Half the time I get it, it&#39;s undercooked and I have to throw it in a pan for a few minutes when I get home to cook off all the grease that&#39;s coating the uncooked noodles.  When it&#39;s cooked properly, it&#39;s one of the best.  But it&#39;s 50/50.
And don&#39;t bother eating in.  Ever.  The service is beyond slow and you&#39;ll leave irritated.  The bar could be good, but there&#39;s always dirty glasses all over it, so you&#39;re grossed out sitting there.  
Just tonight, I had two orders of pad thai to go.  I get home and it&#39;s undercooked.  I call the restaurant to say, &#34;Hey, you have undercooked food coming out again&#34; and the kid on the phone says &#34;Thanks&#34; and hangs up.  I&#39;m dumbstruck.  I call back and ask for the owner, who I think is some white guy with glasses in his 50s.  The kid answers again and I say, &#34;I&#39;d like to talk to the owner&#34; to which he says, with a laugh, &#34;I am the owner&#34;.  
&#34;You&#39;re the white guy with glasses?!?!?&#34;  
&#34;Yep.&#34;  
&#34;And you hang up on a customer who has a legitimate complaint?&#34;

&#34;No, I was talking&#34;

&#34;Tell you what.  I&#39;ll put this on Yelp and see if it helps you out.&#34;

So, this is what you get.  An owner with some cojones who hung up on a customer and laughed at Yelp reviews.  I hope he finds my review equally funny."

I am by no means a food crittic, however oriental thai is my specialty.  Both in preparation at home and as my favorite cousine to eat.  In my journies I have found myself eating thai all over the united states.  Upon my return trip back to detroit from Chicago I stopped here to eat.  Given the yelp reviews the place was hit or miss.  I will review this on two areas, service and main entree.

Service.
When I arrived I waited in the main area for the server to greet me and seat me.  It seemed as if there was only one person serving and a moderately busy day (5-6) different patrons.  Once I received my menu, decided what I wanted, and placed my menu down I waited about ten to fifteen minutes for my order to be taken.  I ordered the red curry(chicken hot spice), chicken satay, thai rolls, and a thai ice tea with water.  As I was ordering thw server tried to walk away twice as if my order was finished.  Seemed rather distracted or rushed.  Now, the time from ordering to receiving the food is automatically forgiven from review as that should never be counted against the service portion of a review.  However I waited 5 minutes for my thai ice tea, and I had to request my water a second time.  I recieved the thai rolls first as expected.  Later the satay, the server forgot the cucumber salad to accompany the satay.  After tracking down the server he apologised and returned with the cucumber salad.  I recieved my food, finished eating and my server disappeared.  A bus boy walking by had to be asked for our check.

Food (preperation, flavor, presentation)

The first appetizer was the thai rolls.  They were medicore, the chicken seemed soggy and the rolls were wrapped poorly.  Presentation was perfect but hard to mess up.  Two rolls cut in half placed on top of one another.  The accompaning sauce was decent, very sweet.  Brown sugar aeemed to be a bit overpowering.

Chicken satay - incredibly disapointing. The chicken appeared to be once frozen pricessed chicken strips fried quickly in yellow curry dauce.  The oils of the frozen flat chicken seemed to run the curry off the meat.  The peanut sauce was thick and lacking the typical zing desired to accompany the satay.  The cucumber salad palate clenser was all wrong.  Although the vegetables seemed fresh, the sauce itself was not simmered enough to properly mix the vinegar with the sugars.  The vinegar was far too over powering and the thick syrup consistancy was a determinate of too much sugar.  Although the onion and cucumber was fresh, it didnt seem as if the flavors sat ling enough to pair well together.

Red Curry - dish arrived as an abomination of a tradional dish (gang gai).   The vegetables consisted of eggplant, green beans, red and green peppers and bamboo shoots.  All of the vegetables seemed to have been frozen, not thawed prior to cooking in the sauce.  The green beans were tough and cooked improperly.  The green and red peppers were soggy and dilapadated, unpalatable.  They lacked the snap and vigor of a fresh vegetable.  The eggplant was sectioned and quartered, rubbery and sour.  The actual red curry sauce was utterly disapointing.  Throughout the entire dish was a chunky white and yellow mystery paste that seemed to coat the vegetables and meat, then reside in the sauce under the main dish.  The consistancy looked like flour added late in the cooking process to thicken, but never mixed well.  Lime was never used to cure the curry sauce, the curry paste they used was sour.  Their main heat ingredient appeared to be sriacha sauce and not tradional ground red pepper flakes.  The dash of brown sugar seemed to be replaced with a heap, to conceal the bitterness of the sauce.  The bamboo shoots resmbled shoe string potatos soaked in water.  Flavorless, soggy and dusgusting.  The rice even was all wrong.  Instead of traditional jasmine rice, cheap, undercooked white rice was substituted.  The rice seperated when placed on the plate and had a slight crunch to it.  Vinegar was not added to the water to soften the kernals.

Thai ice tea- tradionally consists of freshbrewed spiced ice tea and heavy cream, some how evolved into a thick orange syrup.

Overall the experience in both service and foid was horrid.  Nothing about this reasturant is thai.  Not the staff, delivery, food, or tradition.  It is an incredibly unfunny joke.  The food is second rate, old, frozen, premade, and over valued.  The portiin sizes are small in comparison and lack all flavor.  A majority of each of my dishes were left behind as I couldnt stomach eating the rest.

I give this place half a star for poor service, and half a star for uneatible food.  Avoid at all costs."

I like it! It&#39;s a small place, and it appears to be family run. The same woman always answers the phone, and assists me when I come in to pick up my food and pay. She is a delight. Seriously - a delight. Very friendly and prompt. The last time, she greeted me like she remembered me. I appreciate that.

I have had pad thai, and my husband always gets a curry. The food has been consistently good, every time. The restaurant itself looks nicely decorated and clean. When standing at the counter, I can see into the kitchen (also clean). 

This is a simple review - I don&#39;t have much more to say because I have no complaints. The food is your basic, good Thai. It&#39;s not spectacular, but honestly I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever had &#34;spectacular&#34; Thai carryout. Maybe someday, I will... and for then, I reserve the big gun, five star review.

At first when I heard another customer complain that their order was wrong, and they were the only customers in the place I thought - this won&#39;t be good.  But it was delicious and reasonably priced and very large portions.  We had crazy noodles, pad thai, papaya salad, cucumber salad an order of fried rice and they even accommodated  my particular child with a large dish of plain tofu and white rice (with a salt shaker - which is another particular).  All with friendly service.  Though I could imagine that as others stated, service could be slow if we were not the only ones in the place.
The pad thai with tofu lacked any vegetables, which I do normally want in my pad thai - but the Crazy noodles had so much fresh basil in it that it more than compensated.
The papaya salad was not too spicy - not really spicy at all - so for the first time I could eat more than a fork full.  I guess if you like spicy this place may not be for you :)"

I had read online that the owner was Thai and wanted to make authentic Thai dishes for the area.  Many of the &#34;Thai&#34; restaurants in Naperville are actually Vietnamese.  We ordered takeout for our first experience, and we went with our usual fare: basil leaves dish with chicken (bai ka prow), pad Thai (also with chicken), and fish cakes (tod mun).  

The picture online shows the bai ka prow with minced meat, which made me happy because that is the way I am used to it.  Though here in the States many vegetables are usually added, the meat should be the highlight.  However, I was told over the phone that they only could do chopped chicken.  It came with too many vegetables, like raw whole green beans.  I guess if I want it the way that I&#39;m used to it, I&#39;ll have to cook it myself.

The  fish cakes are 6 very small, quarter-sized disks.  They came with sweet and sour sauce, instead of the traditional cucumber-vinegar dressing.  Not worth it for the price.  

The pad Thai was DELICIOUS, but mixed in with the fried chicken was a lot of tofu, which turned my husband off entirely-- he hates tofu.  I like tofu, but was missing green onions you normally see as a garnish.

To mention the service: we were not greeted at the door for several minutes.  But then the person whom I take to be the owner apologized, as well as the young man who eventually assisted us.  They very much seemed like they had just opened, and were overwhelmed.

I will try Yum Yum Thai again.  I WANT them to be the best Thai food around.  However, like most people nowadays, I am on a limited budget and can&#39;t afford to spend money on food that isn&#39;t entirely satisfying.  I am definitely biased, since I was raised eating Thai food.  Yum Yum Thai, you can do better!"

The service needs improvement, we sat down for 10 minutes before the waiter brings us the menu. After the soup came, there were no spoons or bowls...

Updated review 12/10/2015
I&#39;ve been coming here since they&#39;ve been opened, each time I was hoping things will get better but they haven&#39;t. Food is getting worse, the service is slow. There are not waiters besides the pushy owner lady. I don&#39;t think I will come back again."

My family is new to Thai food and this place has been the best! We love the personal feeling we get when we come to this restaurant. We have enjoyed everything we try. We recently tried the Thai crazy noodles which were just as good as the pad see. We do enjoy the garlic noodles and chicken fried rice. It&#39;s a great place for family and reasonably priced. Portions are great, we always leave having leftovers."

The wait time is rediculously slow. The server completely forgot the drink that I ordered. When my wife and I were finally finished, I paid with the debit card but the female owner (who is extremely annoying by the way) didn&#39;t bring my card back so I had to ask for it. I&#39;m not going back to YUK YUK Thai, ever. I&#39;ll be going to Montri Thai instead."

Ouch.  
Sorry to the owners if you are reading this (hopefully you are) but the only thing worse than the service tonite was the food.  You seem to be nice people (I suspect the owners were our servers) and your daughter is really cute, but this was the worst Thai food I&#39;ve ever had.  Maybe turn customers away next time you cannot give them your best?
Granted, we only planned an hour to eat on a Saturday night, but about halfway through this slow motion plane crash of a dinner I politely set $30 on the table for 2 Thai teas, a bowl of soul-less Tom Yum soup that featured some form of alien-like chicken that had a texture similar to par-boiled cardboard. We also received an order of spring rolls (frozen carrots? Really? Not cool) accompanied by a rather watery &amp; bland sauce as we had the common sense to bail out and abandon the entrees.  Pretty nice of me to pay, overpay actually, and be polite as we left right?  Yeah, I thought so too."

We have been looking for a good Thai restaurant for the past four years since we moved here from the East Coast and we feel like we *finally* found one that rivals the neighborhood one we used to frequent. 

We have never encountered the service problems that any of the other reviewers had mentioned. I have always been greeted immediately and they have had my order ready within 10-15 minutes of placing the order. My husband likes extremely spicy food and this is the only Asian restaurant in the area that actually will spice it to his heat level (think habanero hot.) I&#39;m not Thai but I know good Thai food--I can honestly say that this is the only Thai restaurant in the Naperville/Bolingbrook/Plainfield area that serves truly quality, delicious and authentic Thai food.

They have great weekday lunch specials that include a small salad, soup, appetizer and entrée for less than $10.  I forget the actual price, but it is very reasonable.  It&#39;s a bit of a drive from work, so I&#39;m more often there for dinner.  Most of the dishes are quite tasty, but my favorites are the Panang curry and Thai crazy noodles.  I love that they add so many vegetables to these dishes.  Traditionally, Panang curry doesn&#39;t include vegetables, but they add a generous amount and it really enhances the dish.  I daresay you&#39;d be hard pressed to find a much better Panang curry outside of Thailand.  If you want to try something that you don&#39;t often see at most Thai restaurants, order the Hoi Tod with mussels.  It&#39;s made with eggs and flour and comes with bean sprouts and a hot sauce.  It may not be the healthiest dish, but it&#39;s different and delicious!

I&#39;ve been to Yum Yum many times with my wife and friends.  We&#39;ve always had servers that are polite and attentive.  However, when they get busy, the service can start to suffer as they don&#39;t have enough people to handle the crowd.  I don&#39;t hold this against them because this is a relatively new small local business trying to get a foothold in the market.  I&#39;d imagine they would have a hard time making money if they had enough servers to provide 5 star service, or they would have to significantly increase the prices on the menu.  I will continue to visit this establishment every time we get a craving for Thai food (and my wife doesn&#39;t want to cook)."

The delivery driver Shavounta really made the experience, though.  She had such a great warm spirit from the moment she arrived.  When she saw the birthday balloons for my niece, she asked if she could sing her a song.  We agreed, and it was just such a nice and thoughtful thing for her to do for my 8 year old niece.  

Shavounta clearly cares so much about delivering a positive experience to customers.  My niece and I were both touched by this, and I think my niece really enjoyed the birthday song because she felt so special!"

I called corporate office again, filed a formal complaint. Because no manager should ever talk to customers like that! I GET that not every customer is always right, as the saying goes, but seriously dude take MANAGING 101 or something, because your lacking.

Well...that is until you actually get your food. For this service, I went with three other family members for some appetizers and food before popping off to the local all-night flea market. 

We started by ordering some cheese curds and harp strings. The appetizers arrived rather fast (we&#39;re talking maybe five minutes later). I&#39;ll admit, the appetizers were rather good, especially the cheese curds, but the harp strings were kind of surprising. The name Harp Strings and the styling of the restaurant would imply that these are more onion strings, but they arrive as onion rings that were seemingly cut in half. They were incredibly enjoyable, but just know if you&#39;re expecting actual onion strings this is not what you&#39;re ordering.

For my meal, I ordered a buffalo chicken wrap. A pretty simple thing to make, but this is where the lunch service kind of falls apart. The wrap is rather small compared to most wraps you would receive at other restaurants (it looks as if it is made with a smaller tortilla). The chicken was crispy, but the actual sauce tasted generic and bland. There&#39;s nothing special about it. I get it. It&#39;s a buffalo chicken wrap, but you could do SOMETHING to the sauce to make it memorable. Hell, there&#39;s a bar down the street from my house that at least adds some extra spice to the generic sauce they use. As a side, I had ordered the seasoned fries which were very oddly seasoned. Some fries had little to no seasoning, while other fries appeared to have seasoning just dumped on them.

The other member&#39;s of my party all ordered burgers off of the $5 burger special that runs on Saturdays. After the rest of my party decided to choose and order their sides the waiter informed them that &#34;Oh, did you want to do the $5 burger special? That doesn&#39;t come with sides&#34;. This is where I personally started to get annoyed. The daily specials menu does not list this restriction at all and the stock photo they decided to use on the daily specials ad shows a burger with an order of fries. All three of my guests were disappointed but decided to settle with one side of tater tots for the table. When I later asked my guests how their food was, they all chimed in that the burgers were just &#34;ok&#34; and &#34;average at best&#34;.

For three burgers and a buffalo chicken wrap during a slow lunch service, the main courses took awhile to arrive at the table. When the food finally arrived, the waiter acted like he forgot to bring out our tater tots, but judging by the wait I assume he never actually placed the order for them.

The service was sub-par, during a slow service I shouldn&#39;t expect to have an empty glass of water for 3/4 of my service. It&#39;s not like I was on a deserted island and was drinking a million glasses of water. I drank one. One glass and it took 3/4 of my service before I could flag down my waiter for another glass of water.

Overall, the food is average, the plating is horrendous, and the wait staff is slow even during a light lunch service. With so many other options in town, I find the likelihood of stopping in again to be rather slim."

The Quesadillas are back on track as they are using the Charcoal Broiled Blackened Chicken, not the &#34;boiled shredded chicken&#34;, along with the other ingredients.  The chicken is chopped into nice pieces which are easy to eat.  They would be even BETTER if they brought back the EXCELLENT green sauce they once had and if they included the nacho chips also as part of the order like before.  We order our Quesadillas on their &#34;Honey Wheat Tortilla&#34;.  Excellent flavor.  Would give them 5 stars if Green Sauce returned along with the Nacho Chips!  Corned Beef sandwiches are pretty lean and tasty but sometimes dry because they are so lean.  Potato Soup is always excellent.  Tonight&#39;s Vegetable Stack Sandwich was excellent as was the side of freshly cooked Spinach.  In fact, it was awesome.  Keep up the good work."

Everything I have ordered so far has been amazing and was extremely pleased. I seem to get the same server almost every time I have come here and really thought he was gay. Most of my friends are gay and have an amazing gaydar. LOL The last time I was here I was on a date and asked this server for his number so maybe I could have a new shopping buddy. He gave me his number and wondered why he had this huge flirtatious grin on his face when he was giving me his number and I later found out he is not gay by any means and very much into women. So I asked a straight guy for his number while on a date. I can only imagine what was going through his head. Leave it to me to do something like that haha.

Our server was Taylor and she was friendly and attentive. They had $1 burgers and $3 drafts on special, but had run out of burgers at 9pm when we arrived. Our complaint was the food we ordered. Potato soup bowl portion was good, but soup was bland and salty. Nachos again were generous portion but very greasy, even the chips, and chips were weak and broke when we tried to scoop up meat and sauces. Final dish was the &#34;jumbo&#34; wings...hah what a joke! They were actually a bit smaller than usual, dry, overcooked, and the whisky maple sauce was super thin, not applied well, and tasteless. Even with ranch I could only make myself eat 3 of the 6 that come in the $8.99 &#34;medium&#34; order. Overall, we arrived starving and left disgusted and disappointed. If we&#39;d been less hungry and tired we&#39;d have sent everything back. We couldn&#39;t even stomach the thought of taking any of the half-eaten dishes home.

I mean I ordered the vodka with cranberry, yet it only tasted like cranberry juice. Waste of my money. We then waited about 10-15 mins for the bartender to come back to us and ask what food we wanted to order (keep in mind-- we were ready within 5 minutes of sitting down at the bar). I had the Chicken Quesadilla (claimed to have blackened seasoned chicken) and was not good at all. It was kind of hard to eat because all the meat was packed in the ends of the triangular cut Quesadilla pieces. If I picked it up, it fell all over the place (and especially at the bar where the counter is further away from where you&#39;re sitting).

Not every restaurant is amazing, but they&#39;re all worth a shot. Muldoon&#39;s is one such place.

I&#39;ve been here a handful of times and enjoy the warm, irish-y atmosphere and friendly servers. This most recent time, we came late enough that we had to sit in the bar area, which sucked because we pushed two teensy round tables together to make it work. We had a few rounds of beer from a terrible, slow, and aloof server before the bartender took pity on us and just started serving us himself. We ordered some food, I got the Reuben and fries, which was fine. Not great. Not terrible. Just fine. And after three beers (I almost never drink, but it was my birthday. Lay off me!) it definitely hit the spot.

We&#39;ll definitely be back to Muldoon&#39;s for a beer or two when we&#39;re in the area. It may not be anything crazy special, but sometimes that&#39;s exactly what you want."

We came around 6 on a cold Saturday evening and were seated right away -- directly in the path of the door, which despite having a vestibule let cold air in every time it was opened. After waiting several minutes for the hostess to return, we asked to be moved and were shuffled over to a table in the middle of the room that was thankfully not right in the draft. That part was good.

The bad part was that despite a nearly full dining room on a Saturday night, there appeared to only be two wait staff working, and so we waited and waited. We got our waters and then waited another 5-7 minutes to order, despite having been ready to order when we asked for water (because we&#39;d already been sitting there 10 minutes looking at the menu).

We ordered the &#34;Irish Nachos&#34; (not their actual name but I forget what it is), a burger for my husband and pot roast boxty for me.

The nachos (potato chips, shepherd&#39;s pie filling [ground beef, peas, carrots], cheese sauce, pico de gallo) were tasty but not very warm. The same was true when my boxty came out. The interior was warm, but not as hot as you would expect. The pot roast was tender, the gravy delicious, and I ate a good chunk and gladly took the rest home -- but I am sure that our food sat out for awhile.

This theory had credence lended to it when I used the restroom and spotted tons of plates sitting in the kitchen, waiting to be served. I should also note that the bathroom is not what I expected -- one little toilet locked off from the sink area, not super-clean, cramped.

I also saw a lot of people get bread, and we did not, though I can&#39;t be sure we were &#34;supposed&#34; to get some based on our order.

The server did his best but was not apologetic about the wait (though we did not bring it up as an issue).

I also usually enjoy their food.. HOWEVER there are a lot of flies and I was trying to keep them away from my beer the whole time. A good place to catch a game if you don&#39;t mind something a little divey. Sit away from the bar and the flies won&#39;t get you. (The restaurant part is nicer and a fine place to bring kids).

This is one of our favorite casual dining establishments and part of the reason we&#39;d like to move to Wheaton.  You&#39;re treated to some excellent Irish hospitality here and we&#39;ve always had great service.  But the food!  The food is what keeps drawing us back...

It&#39;s an Irish-themed pub &amp; restaurant if you hadn&#39;t guessed from the name, but not in a cheesy kind of way.  Everything we have ever eaten here has been delicious.  Seriously, you cannot go wrong.  My absolute favorite is the Guiness Tips with mashed potatoes and roasted veggies, all topped with a to-die-for Guiness gravy.  I could easily eat the whole plate it&#39;s so good...but for fear of needing to be rolled to the car, I resist and take half home to enjoy the next day.

Then there&#39;s dessert!  I can never choose just one, we always get the same two: the English Toffee Sticky Pudding &amp; the Carrot Cake w/Jameson Scented Cream Cheese Frosting.  Those two desserts are pure heaven for me.  If I had to choose just one it would be the Sticky Pudding, as I have a preference for warm desserts and I adore toffee.  But we order both, eat half of each and take the other two halves home. Sometimes the dessert leftovers make it to the next day...sometimes they make an irresistable midnight snack.

We aren&#39;t big beer drinkers so I can&#39;t tell you anything about their brews.  I can say they have quite a few and others we&#39;ve been there with seemed to enjoy their selection.

If you find yourself with a grumbling tummy in Wheaton, head to Muldoon&#39;s.  And even if your tummy isn&#39;t grumbling there&#39;s always room for dessert!"

The place has a great interior bar look with plenty of booth sitting but its not family restaurant feel. A great bar with a great choice of all-American food. The place was busy for a midweek lunch time and this says something about the popularity of this place in the local area.

Seemed like a real nice place, we were excited to try a new place. The excitement quickly faded as we waited, and waited, and... yeah... waited. We had to ask for our drinks 3 times. 30+ minutes later our waitress came back to take our order. Food was really good (I had the roast veg tato meal). It took us in &amp; out 1hr25 minutes to eascape the restaurant.  Waitress was nice - when she was around.

I frequent this pub about once to two times a month depending on the season for drinks and to catch-up with friends in the area.

The other night I stopped in with family for only a meal, and was left a little unsatisfied. Now, I know what Muldoons is: a pub. For some reason my parents had the place that came before doons and ordered some salmon and pasta dishes. I had a patty melt and it was glorious. So, if you come here for food, keep in mind that they are pretty good at serving burgers, poppers, and fries. If you want a fun, light, young, and busy evening, check-out this place.

Oooo I almost forgot. Try the pineapple infused vodka they make. It&#39;s yummy!"

Waited about 5-10 minutes for a table. Was seated and Sam was our server. Very knowledgeable about the menu and suggested her favorites. Had the tilapia with the sweet mashed and spinach. Spinach was WAY overcooked and needed a bot of lemon. Kids meal came out first...which we requested. Cheese balls were good. Nothing over the moon here but sometimes you just want a meal with no hiccups, nothing burned, no long time tickets, etc. Will go back again.

We got seated by the front door (it was cold) with people coming in, but even after sitting and getting introduced to our waitress, I requested a new place to sit and they let us without any hassle! So great friendly environment. 

My girls and I all got the buffalo chicken wrap (delicious!!) I loved the spice and it included a side so I got seasoned fries. Yum! Especially for a price of less than 10 dollars.

Quick service. They had also provided warm bread with butter as soon as we sat down. They were quick to fill up our waters and get the bill, and everything. We were in no rush. It was a fun night, and had a nice crowd for a Wednesday night. 

This was my first time in Downtown Wheaton and I liked it. Next time, I&#39;m going to go for a longer stroll to see what&#39;s there! Definitely would eat here again!"

It really just seemed like a regular bar with a fancy name. Maybe I came on a night when all the Irish are chilling at home.

Aside from not living up to the name on a Thursday, I was all about the trivia night. It was pretty awesome. We won some free shots and had a jolly ol&#39; time playing with a good group of people. And we can&#39;t complain about the drinks we did pay for. $15 for 3 drinks. Not bad at all."

Bartender was busy for a few minutes, catching up with other people, including tables. Usually in my experience you sit at the bar for quick service, and the bartender isn&#39;t kept busy with tables.

Bartender and staff were occasionally occupied with sports chatter, including a period of several minutes when my glass was empty.

Had the Royale with Cheese burger, medium rare. Came out closer to rare, maybe should have ordered medium well. Patty was large, but otherwise unimpressive. The meat was OK, but not of top quality, and didn&#39;t appear to have much in the way of seasoning. The egg on the Royale was hot off the stove however, perfectly cooked, splattered yolk when I bit into it. The pretzel roll bun was pretty awesome.

Got a caesar &#34;side&#34; salad that came on a fullsize plate, and the fries, along with my burger. The fries were ok, maybe overly salty, some a bit soggy. Nothing to write home about, nothing to rave about.

Paper napkins should be readily available when you&#39;re dealing with runny yolked eggs and greasy burgers. They were not.

The bartender talks faster than I do, and that&#39;ssayingsomething.

Will give these guys another try when it&#39;s not lunch on a weekday."

We can talk to our dinner companions without shouting. Our server Abby was delightful. But this place needs a serious dose of attention to detail. Plates come out of the kitchen looking like no one cares. My fish slid around a largely empty plate. A cup of salad, a piece of bread would have filled and balanced the plate. And the dish of the tail ends of the french fries bin was disappointing and shouldn&#39;t have happened. But worst was the Guinness, a usually smooth and creamy brew that was watery and thin. To their credit the Guinness came off the bill. But management needs to look at every plate and taste its drafts every so often to avoid disappointed customers."

I have been coming here since it was &#34;Cafe Wheaton&#34;. It converted over to Muldoon&#39;s complete with a renovation about the time Wheaton was really re-identifying itself (which included becoming less &#34;dry&#34;!) The timing was perfect...the village was easing up alcohol restrictions, the Irish pub decor was welcoming and it was a great place to belly up for a Guiness and steak bites. That was about the late 90&#39;s. However, several years ago it was sold and I just do not feel it has the same standards. The food is &#34;prepared&#34; and often times unmemorable including my go-to steak bites. Although the recipe was obviously handed down to the new ownership, the bites come out often time tough, under charred and shy on the seasoning. The onion straws that come out with the steak bites is often greasy. The decor is starting to show the wear and tear that has come with age and you can often time find staff congregating at the end of the bar. I would really like to have this place get back to the concept of hospitality and customer service it once was under the old owners."

The menu also features many Irish favorites such as Shepard&#39;s pie along with numerous other delicious food items. There is something there for everyone. Along with the usual bar selections, Muldoon&#39;s has the best Guinness in the area. It&#39;s always perfectly poured and thus comes out nice and creamy."

They told us people had specifically asked for a booth and so even if they came in after us, they would get to sit first. Anyway, we decided to take another 20 min wait for a booth. While we were waiting, a group came in and sat at the open table. The lady in front said, &#34;You guys always make it easy for me,&#34; because they weren&#39;t picky in choosing a booth.

Well that&#39;s what I got from Muldoon&#39;s. 

As I stated above, the food was great! The meal is started with a loaf of bread. We added on an appetizer of mozzarella sticks. I had the Blarney Bacon Burger, which is a burger with bacon, BBQ sauce, cheddar cheese an fried onion strings. My wife had a Ballybunion Club, which is like a triple decker turkey club sandwich.

Our service was good and the price was OK - $43.00 for appetizer, two entrees, and two drinks... the $43 is after tip too. We got two meals out of it too!

Muldoon&#39;s is an American/Irish Pub.  They have a great bar menu and you must try their sliders (prevents hangovers).   The drinks are easy on the gullet and the wallet.  They can also do some pretty amazing things with Guinness (ask my wife, she did NOT have the sliders, Great Night/BAD morning).

When they have live music the band sets up in the corner right next to the bar which may lead you to tripping into them, but what the heck you can buy them a beer apology.  

The bartender was great and enjoyed his job.  He even laughed at my jokes.  I tipped him well.

Gets a little loud, especially when we were there on a weekend. There was live entertainment and a lot of people were there to see that so it got noisy and crowded, but we ended up finding a table in the dining room so that worked out.

The first time was for a band that was playing and the second time I actually had food. I went in here on a Sunday afternoon around 3:00. They seemed to be very short staffed and busy for a Sunday at that time, I believe I ordered a burger which was decent. I really felt bad for our server because he seemed like he was running around with his head chopped off. The bad part is, I don&#39;t recall seeing a manager or anyone else helping him. He just kept getting table after table. He did apologize to us and thanked us for being patient. I know what it&#39;s like to be In his shoes. Overall, the experience was decent. The atmosphere is good and not too loud."

First time at this pub.  Very fun and lively time - the music was great.  I would like to call out our waitress Noelle - she was amazingly happy and nice for the whole 5 hours we were there.  I had to complement her on keeping such a good attitude on such a crazy night.  I of course had the corned beef and cabbage.  It was excellent.  Love the homemade chips too.

I would go back there if I was in Wheaton but nothing screams out &#39;come patronize me&#34;!

The beer selection was nice and on target price wise. I am looking forward to going back to try their bar burger. The soup, sandwich, and salad I had were good and the pre-meal bread was very appetizing. Give it a try but don&#39;t go too far out of your way to do it."

The main bar area is always crowded and the back bar room is a little more spacious and open.  

They serve lamb-burgers, which is awesome. :0)

Little beer garden in the back.

Very hometown atmosphere, nice bartenders, same crowd there often, which is to be expected because it&#39;s the only bar open at night in the fair city of Wheaton.

So why the missing star?  Their nachos.  Yes, I am a fan of nachos and these are &#34;Irish Nachos&#34; or some other lovely thing of that nature.  I love all nachos.

Except the ones with green peas in them.

Yes, my nachos had green peas in them, along with something that resembled pasta sauce.  I wish I could only deduct a half star for this because it seems so petty, but dang, a girl needs her cheese nachos, and green pea nachos just ain&#39;t gonna cut it.

If this happens to be a rare Irish recipe I don&#39;t know about due to my lack of culinary knowledge, then I take it all back and give this place 5 stars. 

Everything else is awesome about this place.  Just don&#39;t get the pea-nachos."

The server we had took a while to come over to get out drink order. Then he brought out some bread for us after sitting there for 30 minutes.  It was super quite in there and you could hear everyone&#39;s conversation they need some music playing at a decent volume.  We waited at least 35 minutes to get our food my boyfriend and myself both ordered a pub burger. When we left the hostess and who I believe was the owner were standing up front my boyfriend told them have a good day and they did not acknowledge him at all. Over all the food was good took a while to come out but the service sucked they need to improve big time. There were only 5 tables filled and 3 servers so I do not know why the service was so bad.

Ive never been overly impressed with anything they offer. The bbq is some of the blandest Ive ever had. Their fried shrimp are pretty tasty, but who cant fry a shrimp? 

The thing that REALLY kills me off the bat is the price. I finally made my way into the local Patio to try a shot at their menu. I got their &#34;patio classic chicken sandwich&#34; and their &#34;loaded mac and cheese&#34; and a fountain drink. $12, wow. The chicken sandwich tasted like they had a tub of pre cooked breasts sitting out. It wasnt very warm or fresh tasting. The &#34;loaded&#34; mac and cheese had some toasted bread crumbs on top, wow, so loaded. Both the sandwich and the mac were crazy tiny, almost kid portions. For $12, Id rather go to a real establishment like Portillos and get a bang for my buck. 

This place is definitely a Portillos &#34;everything under one roof variety&#34; wanna be and they are failing at both value and quality. I wont be back, but Ill most likely have to endure more catering orders at the office."

The skewers make my mouth water just thinking about them. I&#39;ve always felt the layout and order process is a little weird though. You order, take a number, find a seat and then someone brings you your food. Which is easy, but the beer is in a separate line. Maybe that&#39;s my laziness talking but I wish it was all just one quick order process. They also have a drive thru for when you&#39;re feeling like you can&#39;t be seen in public.

The baked potato was the best part followed with the pretzel bun of the &#39;BBQ&#39; burger. For being a bbq burger it had very sparing sauce, I had to add extra, and it was over done. I didn&#39;t finish a few pieces of it. Minimal cheese on the burger and for a third of a pound it looked pretty close to a culvers flattened burger...

We had a big party and sat outdoors - which is a nice feature to help the atmosphere.  I had the barbecue meat loaf which came with garlic mashed potatoes and bread.  It was just ok, nothing special as I&#39;d had better meat loaf at the Golden Corral buffet in Aurora (not Bolingbrook!) and a much better meat loaf at Tony&#39;s on Ogden in Brookfield - for a cheaper price.  
Those who ordered the house specialty - bbq ribs - said they weren&#39;t impressed at all.  Others in the group had a large salad (as a meal), burgers, and a pasta dish.  None of these items seemed to be anything special but all were quite pricy.  Service is pretty good here.  It is arranged for being a tip-less restaurant - which is rare.  All in all, The Patio is pricy with food that doesn&#39;t warrant the somewhat high prices.  It&#39;s surprising they don&#39;t put out better meals since you can practically walk to the Portillo&#39;s to the north, just down the street - which is always busier, probably because it puts out better food for about the same price."

The menu at The Patio is unique, in that it isn&#39;t just BBQ on their menu.  The Patio offers BBQ favorites like ribs and pulled pork, but there is plethora of burgers, chicken, salads, and kebabs to choose from.  

My husband likes the ribs, but I always opt for one of their chicken sandwiches.  This time I had the Monterey Chicken sandwich (with BBQ sauce, Monterey Jack cheese, and bacon) with some cheese fries.  First, the chicken sandwich was massive and that chicken was very tender and coated in BBQ perfectly - no soggy bun!  The fries portion can easily feed 2-3 people, I couldn&#39;t finish them all.

Good luck finding the counter to pick up. It was pricey so when I asked for extra sauce and got attitude I was taken aback. The girl asked me in a nasty voice if I had ordered extra sauce. I told her no because I didn&#39;t think it was a problem to ask for some. We ordered 2 half slabs of ribs and she gave me two little sauce packs. She was absolutely beyond rude. The ribs themselves were awful. Fatty and a terrible flavor. I wrote to their corporate office and I never got a response. I suggest Uncle Bub&#39;s. It is good and will give you extra sauce without the attitude.

We were in the area for a soccer game and just could not pass up a BBQ joint. We ordered pulled pork, brisket, beans, slaw, fries,chicken finger kids meal and grilled cheese.
So the pulled pork was not good it tasted like it came out of a crock pot. There was absolutely no smoke flavor to it at all, in fact I ate only half the sandwich and was scared it was going to make me sick.
The brisket was ok, there was a smoke ring but lacking flavor and dry. The kids meals were both great awesome French fries. I thought the BBQ sauce was way way too sweet I mean its gross. The sauce ruins the BBQ it&#39;s like syrup ewe all you can taste is sugar with a hint of vinegar. 
Come over to house sometime and I&#39;ll show you how to make sauce!
So besides the food the decor was nice and the place was really clean I just don&#39;t recommend the food, sorry that&#39;s just my opinion though."

This chicken is roasted rotisserie style and is fall off the bone tender.  The sauce they give you is an oil based lemon, garlic, and oregano sauce that my family and I cannot get enough of.  We love this chicken so much that we have ordered it for Christmas dinner more than once.  I assure you, your family will swoon over this tender, moist, and flavorful chicken.

I&#39;ve never been to a The Patio before, so this was my first experience.  My foodie buddy suggested the beef brisket sandwich, as he&#39;s not a fan of their ribs - and you don&#39;t order ribs when you&#39;re having lunch with a woman you&#39;re meeting for the first time.  The place itself was very clean and open, and overall it was a pleasant experience.  The brisket sandwich was excellent.  The bun held up perfectly to the BBQ sauce and the brisket itself was tender and flavorful.  Ever-so-slightly pricey at $8.50 (including tax) and served only with a half-pickle (which was good too), but then again, quality BBQ usually isn&#39;t cheap.  My date had salmon with grilled (or sauteed?) vegetables, and it looked fantastic.  Made me wish I&#39;d order the same thing.  She told me she orders it often (she&#39;s a vegetarian) and it&#39;s excellent.

Part of our reason for getting together was a Ms. Pac Man challenge at the machine they have....and I kicked butt, as I usually do, at Ms. Pac Man.  I&#39;ve got skillzzzz  :)"

Fifteen years ago, I worked in the vicinity of The Patio and loved to grab a much better than average burger for lunch. For a treat, my husband and I would come in on the weekends for the rib dinners. I don&#39;t order ribs all that much, but when I do, I like them super saucy, just like the Patio serves---with a side of extra tangy sauce. The dinners include a ginormous, perfectly baked potato and a way too tiny portion of coleslaw (the ultimate bbq sauce foil).

So, on my way out of town last week, I picked up a coupla rib dinners to bring back to STL.  The ribs were tough and stringy.  boo hoo.  Everything else was fine--but even though I kept trying to talk myself back into a Luvs-Me-The-Patio frame of mind, I just couldn&#39;t get there.

I ordered a half slab of ribs with French fries (comes with coleslaw and toasted bread).  Sterling ordered the half chicken with fries.  We were both pleased with our choices.  

My only gripe is that I saw the draft beer on our way out of the place.  Great selections on tap--I&#39;ll have to remember that for future visits."

I was a little surprised by the place, and pleasantly surprised by the food.

They have eat-in or carry out drive-thru.  We went in.  It&#39;s similar to Portillo&#39;s in that there is not really wait service.  You order at a big counter, and they announce the order to the kitchen via microphone.  Ribs, chicken, sandwiches, come in combos with potatoes of your choice.  But do NOT ask to substitute onion rings.  We asked 2 different people there, and they told us no way no how could we substitute onion rings for a potato, even if they just added $3 or $4 to the price of the combo.  Just plain out couldn&#39;t be done. Weird.

Anyhow, we got the food.  Very good.  Even their dry rub ribs were very tasty.  They come with a roll and butter and a little cup of coleslaw as well.  All tasty.

If you should decide to eat in and not carry out like us, teh dining room looks very big.  But it&#39;s quite cafeteria style.  Again, similar to a Portillo&#39;s.  Lots of little tables and booths.  Kind of loud, but very family friendly.  Even some TVs up on the wall in case you have to be out during game time.  We&#39;d come back for the food definitely, but would not really dine in ever, I don&#39;t think.  Bit too cafeteria-y of a vibe."

Today for Mother&#39;s Day my mom asked for us to get dinner from here instead of fighting crowds anywhere else and it was fast and delicious as always. We love the slabs of ribs or the chicken and rib combo dinners- I definitely recommend one of those. Tons of food since the dinners come with coleslaw, a piece of chewy french bread, and choice of potato. I also like to order the broiled salmon and put a little of their awesome BBQ sauce on that- considering they specialize in BBQ and fried or grill items, they also prepare near perfect fish. Also love the appetizers and burgers, sandwiches- can&#39;t really go wrong with any of the food. Check it out and you will probably want to also take a bottle of the sauce home! Really good BBQ"

They&#39;re very weird and draconian about the water.  They must have some real problem with people stealing soda from the fountain using water glasses.  It&#39;s gotten better -- used to be you had to ask for a glass of water at the counter.  Now you just have these tiny plastic glasses labelled &#34;FOR WATER ONLY&#34; that you fill from the dedicated water station.

Never ate in but the dining area seemed OK. Some remodeling of the exterior was done about two years ago. There&#39;s also a drive-thru window.

Service was always OK, although I also experienced having the pronunciation of my order corrected a couple of times (as a few previous reviewers have mentioned). Is that really necessary? But what do I know, I&#39;m just a customer.

Because your customer service effin&#39; blows.  

I had not one, but two rude encounters by your obviously underpaid/lackluster/completely retardedly (yes, I&#39;m using the R bomb) RUDE staff today. 

Normally, I don&#39;t give two hoots. But when I walk in a place and am belittled by staff (oh, horror I worded the name of your food item wrong)... Please berate me and make me feel like the customer ( who is paying for your job to exist)is wrong....

So, I said the food item NAME wrong.  Get smart-ass answer back. Whatever. Try to ignore. Pay my bill.  Lackluster person who hates their job doesn&#39;t even ask if I&#39;m dining in or carrying out. I see bill.  Walk up to disgruntled employee who hates life and is giving me death glare and simply state &#34;can I get this to go&#34;...

Holy hell, you woulda thought WWIII broke out at Patio. Bags are thrown around, bitchy comments tossed my way but said to other surrounding staff instead... I start wondering if my food has been spit in.   

I&#39;m wondering if I&#39;m over reacting and even my co-workers exclaim: &#34;dang, that girl  hates you...&#34;.   Awesome. 


I&#39;m not even going to continue, as the crap service continued for another five minutes. There are a million places to eat in that section of 83rd/75th.

I got a 1/2 slab of ribs and chicken combo, which also came with mashed potatoes.  Add to that a pitcher of blue moon to spread around, and it was an amazing spread for under $20.  I&#39;m not the biggest BBQ guy, mainly because the sauces can get too sweet for me, but the Patio&#39;s BBQ sauce is quite balanced and finger-licking good.  While the amount of food I received was intimidating at first, it was a clean plate by the time I was done.

A nice perk is that they&#39;ll serve you at your table and clear your table after you&#39;re done, so it feels a major step up from any sort of fast food place.  The folks working at the Patio also were very friendly during my visit.

To name a few, ALL of us who ordered baked potatoes had sour cream. NONE of us wanted sour cream, so they went back. Another order had strange sauce on a hamburger; it went back. A hamburger and mashed potatoes were cold. They went back. This many errors are unexcusable. Although there was nothing wrong with my ribs, I had to wait for a &#34;clean&#34; baked potato which was annoying. What happened to Quality Control, i.e., making sure what was ordered is what should be served? I like their ribs, and will probably return, but it&#39;s too bad that so many errors were made, and it really wasn&#39;t that busy! Shame on them."

Note to self:  Take future restaurant reccos from this person with a grain of salt.  The Patio is fast food.  Over and out.  And the sad part?  I brought some out to towners here for lunch based on that recco.  Urrgh!

My first clue should have been the serpentine line to place your order like they have at Portillo&#39;s or Wendy&#39;s.   I  thought there was going to be table service.  I guess if you count the guy running through the restaurant with your basket of food looking for a number I was supposed to have stuck in my stand- it&#39;s table service.  Shoot me- I prefer sitting and reading a menu.

When the food came (and it came all at different times for our group as there were 7 of us) the food runners just stood and shouted what was in the basket or bowl.  Appetizers showed up at the same time as entrees- it was all a big mess.

The food itself was okay although no one had their signature dish of ribs.  We&#39;re ordered burgers, sandwiches and salads, but most  things were just alright.  There were stale noodles and croutons for the salads (not encouraging) and the fries were undercooked- and my patty melt would have benefited from grilled onions versus fresh, but the steak sandwich, bacon burger and hot dog got OK marks.

In my book- if you want BBQ ribs- I&#39;d go somewhere else.  If you are looking for an alternate burger place- this could fit the bill.  Just keep your expectations at a realistic level.  Oh- and don&#39;t listen to this friend of mine who raves about this place.  You might feel the way I did.  Let down."

It was crowded when we went, which was not conducive to the wend-your-way-order-at-the-counter setup; then finding a table was another cause for anxiety amid the forest of people. The ribs I got were fatty; isn&#39;t that their specialty?! You&#39;d think they&#39;d at least get them right. 

Between the crazy setting and the bad food, I won&#39;t be going back. It&#39;s become a joke in our family; whenever we drive by someone says, &#34;Oh, there&#39;s S&#39;s favorite restaurant!&#34; Not hardly.

They are very efficient so you never have to wait long for your food whether dining in or going through the drive-through. It&#39;s a great place to go if you want really good food (they have a pretty diverse menu) quick or if you have a group and don&#39;t want the hassle of waiting."

The salad was not your traditional iceberg salad, thankgoodness!  Whenever I head to places like this, its always a horrible salad that they are trying to push on you.

The atmosphere of this location is nice.  Open with windows.  Clean.

The food is pretty good.  I like to eat the various BBQ items like brisket and ribs which are always satisfying.  They have 2 types of sauce (mild and spicy).  Both are very good.

They also have pretty good soup.  My gf is partial to the cream of chicken shell.

The prices are slightly high here.  It would be considered a fast food restaurant, but most meals will cost a person $10+.  Not horrible, but you could probably find better deals elsewhere."

The sauce is the only thing that brings me back once a year. As restaurants often do...Patio fell into the &#34;sacrifice quality for cost&#34;. As a previous business owner, I can certainly sympatize, but not when it comes to food. Now they offer tough, barely there meat on the bone ribs. Shame really. The price isn&#39;t cheap either $19.00 for a full slab. That&#39;s a lot considering you are getting about a 1/4 slab of meat. A tuna sandwhich is about $6 w/o fries and their chicken has NO flavor unless doused in sauce.  Their creamy soups are just that. Sometimes so thick that it&#39;s a clumpy mess.

I should just end my review there and let that speak for the Patio entirely, but I guess that it just wouldn&#39;t do it the justice it should receive.

But seriously, the Tuna Melt at this place is absolutely delicious and all that a great Tuna Melt should be. Perfect chunks of tuna, mixed with a little bit of mayo (but not a lot, as many places unfortunately do), celery and onions minced to perfection, and placed between two slices of Cheddar cheese on Rye, melted and grilled to absolute heavenly goodness. This, my friends, is the essence of a great Tuna Melt! And The Patio has never let me down!

The place is not a sit down, fancy restaurant, so don&#39;t go in there expecting something that its not. No, instead, you order up at the front counter, and then take your order number with you to your table of choice. Then, a runner will bring your food to you when it is ready. But don&#39;t let that deter you from going there. The food is very good, and nothing that I have ever had there has ever let me down.

I&#39;m not a big ribs fan, but they are &#34;famous&#34; for them, and I know many people that would vouch for that title. They have a vast menu to choose from, and multiple locations around the Chicago &#39;burbs to choose from.

Since it is a Euro flair, understand it is not comparable to Panara bread or something like Olive Garden. Service is quaint but can be slow if you&#39;re thinking fast food. This is for a diner with time to enjoy. 

We have tried over the years each and every one of the savory crepes and save the nutella/chocolate fruit filled one for dessert. My youngest had a birthday lunch here and had her favorite- croque monsouir. Ham and cheese on a croissant. I always order the salmon filled crepe or the chicken/mushroom/spinach. When the dessert comes, it is usually met with a roaring cheer. I tried to take a pic for the review.

Croque Madame Croissant - Excellent, recommend with chicken, egg over easy and gruyere cheese. 
Savory Crepes -There is a lot of options here, the website has a limited menu. I&#39;d recommend the spicy one with scallops or the roasted pepper. Both very good! 
Sweet Crepes - Strawberry cheesecake, I&#39;ll admit we got 2 to go one day. Very good dessert! The cinnamon roll was very good. Great job on the cream cheese filling.

The crepes can take a little bit of time to be presented from the kitchen. However, I am absolutely okay with waiting several extra minutes because the crepes are made fresh! 

I&#39;ve had the Boeuf Bourguignon savory crepe, and the Croque Madame Croissant, both of which were freshly made, filling and delicious. I&#39;ve had several other crepes - one savory and one sweet.

Perfect for breakfast, lunch, or a light dinner, the crepes are to die for!  I had trouble deciding what to order, so I went simple:  Ham and Cheese (with goat cheese).  The portion was much larger than I expected and was served with a small salad.

The coffee menu is a sugar-addict&#39;s dream.  There are so many different flavor options (vanilla, toffee, cupcake, etc), I had a Honey Vanilla Cappuccino that was slightly sweet with a smooth vanilla flavor.  I wish I could drink this every day!

The inside of the restaurant is cute and casual, like a diner, but could use a shabby chic facelift to emphasize the &#34;France&#34; in &#34;La France.&#34;  However, the atmosphere is warm and comfortable. I had lunch here with my mom and aunt, and I felt that we were welcome to relax and linger for awhile.

The service was a little bit slow, but we weren&#39;t in a hurry, and they were super apologetic about this.

I&#39;d like to come back sometime to try the sweet crepes too.  For something a little different, I highly recommend La France!"

The best crepe I&#39;ve ever eaten hands down. We also got the green tea which comes in the tiniest cutest cups you&#39;ve ever seen.

The restaurant has a cafe side and a restaurant side, both have plenty of seating and there&#39;s a bar as well that looked like it was well stocked with wine!

Service was outstanding. We were checked on regularly and I believe it was the chef I met at the end of the night that was telling us about some new recipes he&#39;s making. Sounded yummy!

Very quaint restaurant that made me feel like I could be sitting in France instead of Lombard, haha.

They have savory crepes too but I always recommend the sweet stuff :)"

The atmosphere and seating takes a good run at setting a mood without being snooty. The food is excellent and the flavor combinations surprise your mouth. I love the curry crepes they are the best.

We visited here on a Saturday morning at 9:15 and there were just 2 other customers in the restaurant.  We each ordered the strawberry cheese cake crepes.  I had a coffee and she had an orange juice.  The coffee was served cold and a sent it back.  The second cup was also served cold and I sent that back.  The server returned with the cup of coffee stating that this is the temperature the coffee is served but to &#34;make you happy, I zapped it for you.&#34;  I swear to god he said &#34;zapped&#34; as in he MICROWAVED IT!  It was hot now but the coffee they serve is very weak.  My daughter&#39;s orange juice was not very good and was some cheap institutional food service kind out of a jug.

Our crepes arrived and were also served cold.  This was a major turn-off.  I questioned our server if they are supposed to be this way and he said yes.  Having eaten crepes in other restaurants, I have never been served a cold crepe.

Our bill arrived and my daughter and I were eager to leave (she did not even receive a birthday wish after I stated that this was her special birthday breakfast).  They nickel and dimed me on the bill and charged $1 extra for the whipped cream on each of our crepes (seriously, who does this?)  The owner came to our table to take my money and pompously said, &#34;I heard you had a problem with the temperature of the coffee.  Just so you know, our coffee is served at the proper temperature of 140 degrees.&#34;  This guy needs to go back to school.  The National Coffee Association&#39;s standards for brewing state a water temperature between 195 to 205 degrees Fahrenheit for optimal extraction.

I wish we had a better experience since we live close by and try to patronize local businesses.  However, the staff here was neither warm nor inviting and seemed to not care about creating a positive experience."

That&#39;s not including a beverage, of which the coffees seem equally overpriced. My friend and I waited a decent amount of time for our first savory crepe to share. It was a chicken and caper with cream sauce affair. While quite enjoyable, the side salad was simply a small-scale shredded lettuce and diced tomato covered in a simple vinaigrette. I actually found my strawberry and nutella crepe a bit disappointing. While the crepe itself gave an okay crunch, the nutella wasn&#39;t even warm, leading me to believe that they just added the other ingredients after pre-making the crepe. Another point down, they charge extra for toppings like whipped cream. While service was decent, this place is not the best for the wallet or the pallet."

Service was slow (even though the restaurant was at less than half capacity) our server came back twice to double check something about the order and yet she still forgot something we ordered, and the food was overpriced for its quality and size. 

We ordered a hot chocolate (they served it luke warm), croissant egg sandwich (was soggy), and the nutella strawberry crepe (which was good, but nothing to write home about). 

Overall, this place is over hyped. I know it&#39;s hard to find crepe places locally in the Lombard area, so I MIGHT be back if I ever have a crepe craving; but otherwise I doubt I&#39;ll be back. I&#39;d rather drive the extra few miles and go to Honey Jam."

From the menu items to the eclecticism of the locale, everything reminds the diner of a French cafe, not a restaurant on Main Street in Lombard! Even better, since they&#39;ve moved down the street and to a location that holds more than a handful of diners. Authentic from the vinaigrette salad with a savory and a dessert crepe, we walk out stuffed, satisfied and feeling oh so French, even if only for a meal. It&#39;s nice to see and taste the attention to detail in the ingredients stuffed into the most flavorful crepe. Lox isn&#39;t just lox, it tastes like Nova lox. Ham and cheese is a bountiful crepe without the salty aftertaste. The braised beef melts in one&#39;s mouth and the chicken breast is moist, not a single bite of dryness. The owner and staff are working out the bugs of running a much larger location, but it&#39;s worth the wait. Kindness goes far, both on their end and diners end. Sassing to the staff isn&#39;t going to make a crepe come out faster. The hours are slightly bizarre, but not so much that there&#39;s never a time to go. Those dying for a delicious crepe and &#34;French&#34; experience just have to keep their mind off of the idea of crepes on Monday and Tuesday. I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve had a better crepe in Paris, Provence or the Loire Valley. Just as good, definitely, better, not so."

This place had potential but considering my bf and I waited over an hr and 15 mins for two crepes we won&#39;t know if the food was at least good.  It took our server 15 mins just to greet us and get our drink order.  The coffee was good but the o.j. was also served in a coffee mug, unlike the tables around us which had full glasses.  I&#39;m curious to see how we would have been charged for those.  Anyways savour that first pour of coffee bc that&#39;s the only time we got any in the full hr and 15 mins we waited.  We weren&#39;t even offered water.  When I finally asked for a refill on the coffee he came back five mins later and told us it was brewing and would be ready in 30 secs but five mins after that, we still had no coffee. The table to our right had left after not even finishing half of their meal...I overheard the lady say she didn&#39;t order mushrooms and the eggs weren&#39;t scrambled.  Another table left who also had waited over an hr for their meal so we finally decided we no longer wanted to wait on our order either, left money for the drinks and orevuar&#39;d out of there!

If that&#39;s not telling enough about his place, not sure what could be.  Don&#39;t waste your time.  I could have made my own fresh crepe with fresh ingredients 10 times over.  No stars for this place.

I have been to La France only 2 times as I&#39;ve just recently learned about it. What a hidden gem! The first experience I had was at their old location and I got this amazing croissant covered in egg ham cheese etc. it was phenomenal and I couldn&#39;t help but to eat off of my son and fiancé&#39;s plates! Nutella Crepes and sugar butter crepes! Omg!! Service was quick and coffee was plentiful.

My second visit to La France was at their new location and I can&#39;t describe how excited I was to go! I had been waiting for them to open this location as it is the end of my street. I can walk their and burn some calories because eating lite isn&#39;t something that I do when I eat breakfast! When we walked up to the door their was a sign that said it was a SOFT OPENING and that wait times would take much longer than usual. I had nowhere to be so we went in. There were 3 of us and the place was packed. We were seated instantly and the waiter (same man from the old location) said that it was the soft opening and it would take some time to get the food out. That was fine with us. We got coffee and water and enjoyed conversation while reading over the menu. I picked a crepe with steak mushroom spinach and some sauce that I can&#39;t pronounce, my son of course got the sugar butter crepes and my sister got a crepe with chicken and red peppers with some other stuff(so I&#39;m not a French food expert). We also placed an order to go for the croissant that I got the first time. Omg the food was phenomenal. I even ate the left overs on a pretzel roll later. They were big portions and the food had so much flavor. 

I personally believe the food was completely worth the wait especially as it was told several times and in several ways that it was a soft opening and that the waits would be longer. I also know how small the last cafe was and how much bigger this place is. The staff had sooo much to adjust to from the last place and I think they did a great job. I have no doubts that with a few weeks of being open the service will be quicker. Bottom line, we will be going back probably once a month:) I&#39;m in love"

I am delightfully full and really looking forward to finishing up my mango mousse dessert later. I had a hearty crepe for my main course: braised beef with wild mushrooms, spinach, a delicious sauce, topped with some shredded Swiss (real flavorful Swiss too, extra marks!). I had previously had the lox crepe, which I also enjoyed and found fair lighter, but just as flavorful. I could have easily finished my meal this time with the beef but upon hearing how fresh the mango mousse was I had to have dessert. Delightful! 
Staff was very friendly both times, and we actually placed out dessert order after closing this second time. No rush to get us out, in fact they were quite glad to chat and inform us of their hope to be serving beer, wine, and hard ciders once they can get the license for the new location (bureaucracy takes time to process).

Our experience was not good.  I ordered something off the special menu.  Our waitress said it was a favorite.  LAter she came back with menus in hand stating there was no beef that day.  We would have to order something with chicken or seafood.  The chef failed to prepare the beef the night before and it would take way to long to prepare what was ordered.  Also no slivered almonds available although description on menu stated it came with slivered almonds.  Lemon for tea-tiny sliver.  Asked for more, another tiny sliver.  All in all, an expensive lunch totally not what we had hoped for.  Will. It return"

The service was excellent, welcoming and very attentive. They have an extensive menu not just of crepes and desserts but also coffees and teas. We are both crepe lovers and the variety of ingredients they combine in each crepe was unusual and very tasty. We had the chicken curry and chicken caper entree crepes. Both were delicious with a wonderful combination of ingredients. People who complain of the prices are simply off - the crepes are very large and come with a small salad. Definitely worth the money. For desert, we had the Key Lime crepe which was like eating the essence of the best key lime pie you&#39;ve ever had inside a crepe with plenty of toppings to add. We will definitely be coming back here again."

I&#39;ve been to this location a number of times and they really know what they&#39;re doing when it comes to sandwiches. The subs are massive and stuffed/overflowing with fresh ingredients. 

I always get the #9, a turkey sub. It&#39;s the best turkey sub I&#39;ve ever had. Their sandwiches a WAY better than Subway, Jersey Mike&#39;s, or Jimmy John&#39;s. 

The staff is super friendly and they do an amazing job. 

If you&#39;re super hungry they have a 3 foot long meatball sub challenge, where if you eat the sub in an hour you get the sandwich free and your photo on the wall of fame. Only two people have completed the challenge successfully, but there are a lot of photos on the wall of shame.

Another plus is they have Maui Onion chips, which are absolutely delicious.

Yes, I know the name is &#39;Fontano&#39;s Subs&#39;, and yes the Subs are very good.....but this place has the BEST Beef Sandwich and BEST Meat Ball Sandwich around....anywhere.

Better than Portillo&#39;s, better than Al&#39;s beef, better than Buona, better than Mickey&#39;s Red Hots, better than Smiley&#39;s, better than Mr. Beef.....it beats them all.

How do I know this?  Scientific Research.

After trying both the Beef and Meatball Sandwich, I thought to myself &#34;Wow, that&#39;s the best I ever had.  Could it really be true, or was I wrong?  Well, in the last few weeks I&#39;ve tried Portillo&#39;s.....tried Buona, tried Al&#39;s, tried &#39;The Patio&#39;.......and YES, the Beef Sandwich at Fontano&#39;s is the best.

Why is it better?  First of all taste and tenderness, the most generous portions of actual beef stuffed into the sandwich, and finally the bread.  

If you doubt my research, try it for yourself.  Take the challenge, and eat beef sandwich&#39;s for lunch for a week straight.....and then you tell me what you think!"

There is nothing &#34;restauranty&#34; about these subs; if you want this taste, just go to Jewel and get some hard Italian bread and then put stuff on it.  The meat is very good, the cheese is &#34;okay,&#34; and both are very fresh and look like they may even be more natural then another random &#39;restaurant&#39;.  But they put it on that shitty bread.  Basically go here if you&#39;re hungry and really want to be full and/or don&#39;t like ordering random things (such as 3 sandwiches instead of a meal) in order to keep yourself full, and don&#39;t mind paying for something that&#39;s exactly the same as what you would make at home.  The place is also VERY expensive; over $5 for a 6-inch sandwich and nearly $10 for a meal (but with only a 6&#34; sandwich).  Then again if the meal is filling you, does that make it better?  I don&#39;t know.  The owners are VERY nice, but unusually they don&#39;t harass anybody.  I have literally never seen that combination before, except sometimes at Caribou Coffee, but these guys are nicer then most Caribou Coffee, though not necessarily the particular Caribou that is next door (because they are also insanely nice).  They have no oils for their breads or sandwiches, which is really not good because the bread is so hard it actually cuts your mouth (though it wasn&#39;t stale).  I really wouldn&#39;t recommend this to anyone, since all  kitchen, but I can&#39;t say I&#39;d never go back if I was ever here forthey make is the same thing you could make in your some reason, since the only other places with food that I see are Subway, which will never fill you up even though it tastes amazing (though a lot of Subways should be  boycotted on principle of disgustingly-acting employees), and Dunkin Donuts, which is even more expensive then, well, any restaurant or food-seller you&#39;ve ever seen in your life.

this place should be packed at dinner time. SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL BUSINESSES!"

This location is ran by the Fontano family The sandwiches are as good as the location in Little Italy on Polk in Chicago, they use a hearty bread from Gonnella which makes their sandwiches excellent. If you are looking for a nice hearty sandwich that will satisfy your hunger this is the place to go, if you are looking for a sandwich on airy bread go to one of those franchise joints. I prefer this location on 95th in Naperville over the Ogden location."

First I would go back again.  I would be interested in trying their Italian Beef Sandwich.  They only have 1 kind of bread which is fine.  The Italian Bread was good, but we have kids and it can be hard for them to chew depending on the age.  Our kids gave up eating the sandwich so I had to go with something else.  Also it would help if they had an allergy menu.  They have several different sizes of subs and a little slimmer of a menu.  I would like to have seen the reverse.  But it is a good sandwich overall, very nice people and I would go back."

Our waitress&#39;s name was Megan. She was very rude. Also, our drinks nor chips and salsa were ever refilled. She kept attending to another table, ignoring us. Probably because they were buying alcoholic drinks (aka more $$).  

She took forever to come check on us. She only did once. We quickly asked for the checks while we had her attention. It was me and 4 other girls. She put all of us on one ticket and said she was unable to separate the items. Made it such a headache to pay and figure out amounts. Once again, very rude about this situation.

Once we figured our payments out (no thanks to our waitress), she came back with the tickets and slammed them down. We then noticed she increased the price of our bills. 

Oh, and the food...ehhh I&#39;ve had much better for much cheaper. 

Would NEVER go back. So disappointed."

Recommended it to a group of friends while we were out that way. Wasn&#39;t expecting to be disappointed :/ 

Ultimately, what it came down to was the practically nonexistent service. Saw our server maybe twice (greeted and dropped the check), an entirely different girl took our order, ran our drinks, and provided us with what we needed with our meal after it being ran by a food runner. We work in the industry amd understand entirely, but it was not crazy busy and her absence was bothersome to us. 

the food was good. I thought $9 for a tiny margarita in a plastic cup was a little nuts but very good and you can&#39;t skip the $3 Corona to finish the meal. 

Not from the area, but if I do come back it&#39;ll only be for a beer outside to hear the band. If that&#39;s what you&#39;re looking for I think it&#39;s a great spot with good vibes."

But as a Mexican restaurant, Potter&#39;s Place is the pits. Except for the queso fundido, their food is bland. Salsa is watery, chips are stale, it&#39;s all just so blah....Wish it weren&#39;t so, but it is. 

As for the drinks, they are okay. The margaritas are too sweet for me so opt for a beer and you&#39;ll be better off. Like I said, the bartenders are good.

After that encounter with the staff, no one came to see if we wanted a drink or to order food for somewhere around 10 minutes.  I feel like it was our lucky day another bartender clocked in or else we probably would not have been served for another 10 minutes or so when the other bartender arrived from searching for a to go order.

Me and my family were a party of 5. Our server today was Morgan D. She didn&#39;t welcome us at all, she had an attitude from the very beginning. When I asked for lemon in my water, when my mom asked for guacamole on the side of her entree, she wasn&#39;t kid friendly either with my niece. Before she took our order she DID NOT explain to us that we wouldn&#39;t be able to do separate checks. AND didn&#39;t tell us the policy was in the menu in fine print till after the fact. Yes, that was when it was all of our wrongs because we should of asked or read the fine print (but who does?) and she should of done her job correctly and told us that BEFORE taking our order. When I confronted her about splitting the checks she had a horrible attitude and said &#34;well, it does say it in the menu that we can&#39;t spilt checks.&#34; If she would of said sorry for not telling us about it, everything would of been fine! I asked to speak to a manager, explained to her what happened. All she did was apologize and try to blame it on them being busy, mind you there was only 3 other people in the inside part of the restaurant. The patio wasn&#39;t very busy either.

In the summer Potters Place is a very lively, noisy spot because of its fun outdoor patio. In December, it&#39;s a great place for an intimate dinner with a friend.

I had the 3 street tacos plate and it was delicious. Each taco was fun and delicious plus the price was very reasonable.

I only had water to drink and no hot beverage at the end. When I go to a Mexican restaurant I love to order a Mexican Coke in a bottle and then finish the meal with a Mexican hot chocolate.

Never again.

Potters Place has a great patio in the back of their restaurant, don&#39;t get me wrong. But it&#39;s so not worth dealing with the poor service, horrible food, and margaritas that come in plastic cups. Plastic cups?? Really? I thought maybe it was because they didn&#39;t allow glass on the patio by law, but tell me why everyone is drinking from glass beer bottles?

The first time I came, I got the burrito. It was over $10 and it did not come with beans and rice. I had to pay extra for that. The second time I went here just the other day for a lunch date with Mom. I order the sangria margarita and she ordered the golden margarita. The margaritas were good, very strong, but the plastic cup just really threw me off. They bring out ONE complimentary basket of chips and salsa. If you ask for another basket, they charge you $3.00. That&#39;s lame. We each ordered ONE taco and they were $3.75. That&#39;s also pretty ridiculous for one taco, but whatever.

She ordered the fajita steak taco and I ordered just a regular steak taco. BOTH were so small that after two bites it would have been gone. I&#39;m not exaggerating. Just looking at it was unappetizing. The meat was completely black and charred, as you can see in the pictures. We took one bite and sent it back. Absolutely disgusting.

The waitress offered to make us new ones, but we were still upset about the size of the tacos for the price, so we declined the offer and asked for our check. We ended up paying $21 just for TWO MARGARITAS in PLASTIC CUPS.

Me , my sister, and my friend shared the nachos... Ew they were nasty , the chips were soggy and it looked like they put a pound of black beans on them. I ordered a diet pepsi, which i dont know if its just me but when i order a pop i dont look at the menu, i dont see the point bc its either diet coke or diet pepsi... So i ordered my diet w the waitress and also got three refills. Our bill came and there were two diets so i asked her about it, she said , if you have more than two refills we charge you ?!?! WHAT??? Ive never ever been to a place that did that. I took two sips out of the third and told her, if you would have told me that , i would have gotten water . I now have to pay $5.00 for a diet peps? Thats dumb!!! She said, i dont know what you want me to do!!!! So i told her forget about it give me the bill. So she took her money out and said, here i will pay for your pop here is $3.00 and threw it on the table in front of me. I said no im over this place and she insisted and walked away... Now i ask, why in the hell would you do that to someone when you work for tips? 
I WILL be calling the bar and talk to the manager or owner and also write a letter about her. We also had a lot of plates on the table so my friend asked, can you take some of these plates away because its really crowded on the table. She gave her a look and said, ha no! She also asked another girl we were with what kind of drink she wanted , she asked for vodka with soda and a splash of lime... She charged her for Kettle One !!!!
She sure did work for her tip, she got back the $3.00 she threw at me and $4.00 from the girl she overcharged . If she was decent , she would have walked away with at least a $25.00 tip !!!!!!
The bar itself is ok, it was busy and security had these little lights they were flashing telling people not to stand in the walkway when the entire outside is mostly walkways. They didnt check our  IDs when we walked in either . 
All together, i will NEVER EVER go there again!!!!!.... I almost forgot, they serve wine in plastic cups?!?!? Is this a keg part or a bar??????"

Traveling outside of my hometown and my handlers insist on taking me to Mexican because they know &#34;I love it so much.&#34;  Yes I do, but, it has to be good.  The funny thing was in this particular situation, as we pulled into the handy free parking garage in downtown N&#39;Ville, I did a Yelp! monicle search and Potters was the 14th lowest rated place in a 2 block radius,  Uh hem, men, I&#39;m in Chicagoland - can we please get some Italian.

Pluses outside of the very good looking female wait staff ... guac was very good.  And a massive load of the green stuff provide instantly when ordered.  Excellent hot sauce selection at the table.  

Minues - chips we bland and almost stale.  Fajitas were strange - no sizzling platter of meat-n-veggies.  Fajitas were plated next to the rice &amp; beans.  And they were not partically special.  Just meat and veggies.  Overcooked veggies.  Other dishes I sampled from the handlers were equally bland,  No more mid west Mexican dining for a long time!"

For starters...the place gets pretty packed, but so does every place in Downtown Naperville.  The beer garden is pretty nice though, no complaints about the atmosphere.  We came here to see the band that was playing so our table was already there pretty much, well... we sat with others associated with the band.  

As for service...it started out alright and progressively got worse.  Into our meal our table was getting really crowded with plates we weren&#39;t using, empty glasses, etc.  One of the people at our table asked our server &#34;Katerina&#34; or &#34;Katrina&#34; or something or other if it was going to be cleared off and she got a look like &#34;Like I&#39;m going to be doing that???&#34; and ignored the question and walked off.  

As for the food - guacamole is good, split the chicken nachos - the chips on the bottom were incredibly soggy that we only ate what was on top.  As for the chips on top and the chips that went with the guac were close to inedible.  They just didn&#39;t break up well - a little hard to describe.

I ordered a sangria - $7 served in a plastic cup.

Now back to the rest of the service... I, personally look at the menu as I order.  Not all places give free refills on soft drinks.  I&#39;m no longer a soft drink person but when I was I&#39;d look to see if a refill was included...sometimes it is only on iced tea, etc.  Every place is different and I did look.  My sister did not look - though that&#39;s besides the point. She asked why she was charged for two diet pepsis and the server said because after two you&#39;re charged for another (she had three).  There were several ways she could have handled the situation...one being, comping it, or just reiterating the menu states that drinks include ONE refill (if the menu even does, I don&#39;t know...didn&#39;t look)  but instead she threw down $3 out of her tips and said &#34;Here, I&#39;ll buy your drink&#34; and it wasn&#39;t polite - if anything she could have said she&#39;d take care of it and throw it in there when we paid the bill...but no, she was RUDE about it.  Well...that WAS her tip at the end of the night, she got her $3 back on our $57 bill.  I&#39;m not a fan of doing that and skimping on the tip but when you work as a waitress, server, or whatever you work off tips and her attitude did not deserve one.

There are way better places to hit up in this area, I&#39;ll be sure to avoid this one in the future."

The complimentary chips and salsa we so-so; stale, bland chips but good salsa. We decided to try something different and ordered an apple margarita and a sangria margarita. Horrible! The apple tasted like straight up Sour Apple Puckers. The sangria margarita tasted like the pre-mixed cheap lime margarita you&#39;d buy at the grocery store (no &#34;sangria&#34; flavor). At $8 each, I could definitely make better drinks at home. 

Dinner was a little better. We got a few different tacos: shrimp, al pastor, and skirt steak. The shrimp and skirt steak tacos were pretty tasty. The al pastor tasted like BBQ pulled pork (not what al pastor should taste like at all). They all needed a splash of hot sauce, too. However, 10.95 for 3 small tacos and no sides was a little pricey. 

We really should have read reviews before coming here. We know to avoid it next time."

The chips and salsa were great! We ordered guacamole for an appetizer, which was just ok...it was really bland.  For my entree I ordered the chicken tacos which again were just okay.  The real bummer was the price of the food.  It was very expensive for the quality and quantity of the food.  It was $3 extra to order rice and beans...pretty crazy if you ask me.

The service was great, but we won&#39;t be returning if we feel like having mexican food.  We will return to have a drink on the patio!"

Naperville lacks a quality outdoor space to drink and relax (Potter&#39;s, Jimmy&#39;s are really it).  The drink prices are fair for downtown and cheaper then Chicago.  

But man is the food terrible and over priced.  I have eaten her 4-5 times now and grow more disappointed with each visit.  We went last Saturday and we had stale chips- and we had a large group so about 4 baskets worth.  All were terrible.

Tacos were small and clearly not the best or freshest ingredients.

Wait staff was solid and always is.  But

Chips and salsa- salsa great but chips were soggy and tasted stale.  Yuck. 

Frozen strawberry margaritas- awesome, but at 32 dollars a pitcher, I&#39;d rather make them at home 

Choose 3 tacos- al pastor, steak, and pescado, I asked for no onions on each. What I got- braised beef, chicken and al pastor- loaded with onions.  The waitress showed me the ticket and the order was put in correctly, but definitely came out wrong. No apologies, but at least she went back to get me a fish taco... With onions. Argh. 

2 pitchers, 1 burrito, 3, 3 taco meals, 2 rice and beans,  and a kids pbj... 130 dollars.  Yup, one hundred thirty dollars.

The first time I went to Potter&#39;s, I was drunk, so I thought the &#34;Christmas tree&#34; burrito was the most amazing thing ever.  Years later, and a few more visits down, I realize this place just plain sucks.

We only went here because Giordano&#39;s had a wait and we wanted to catch a movie.  On a Friday night, there wasn&#39;t a wait at Potter&#39;s.  

For $10, your burrito comes with, wait for it, nothing.  Beans and rice are extra.  The burrito itself is just OK.  I&#39;ve had better at every other Mexican restaurant I&#39;ve ever been to.  The burrito is filled with meat and nothing else, topped with cheese (they claim there is &#34;extra&#34; cheese on top of the Christmas tree, but mine was sparsly sprinkled with cheese), sour cream and guacamole.  Served alongside white, wilted shredded lettuce, it was a disappointing dinner.

The margaritas are overpriced, I think we paid $7 for a house margarita on the rocks.  They&#39;re tiny as well, which is weird when you think about how many Mexican restaurants promote olympic swimming pool-size margaritas.

The service is terrible.  The hostess just stared at us, the waitress took forever with water refills and our chips &amp; salsa, and the worse part was the manager, of all people.  We sat a table too close to the front door and hostess stand, and the manager kept leaning around the corner while talking to the hostess.  He demonstrated the light dimmer to her, while people were eating the lights were flickering.  Couldn&#39;t this training tip wait until after-hours?  Their conversations, while standing over our table, were unbearable to listen to.

My visit previous to this was with a friend.  The restaurant was near empty, and after dropping off our drinks, the waitress never came back.  Almost an hour later, we left without paying and without ordering dinner.

I won&#39;t go back - not even if I was drunk."

I went to this location the other night on a date figuring it would be great Mexican food.  Like I said, the waitress and bartender were great (very friendly), but when we ordered our drinks the were out of the 2 beers I first ordered and my date ordered a Margarita. When her drink came it was in an old plastic beer mug and rather weak tasting. Who serves them that way in the first place?  Right away we received some chips and salsa. The chips were greasy and the salsa was so bland there was almost no taste. I went ahead and ordered the steak enchiladas and she ordered the Tamale dinner.

When the food arrived incredibly fast I was happy. But when I looked at my food, the enchilada looked burnt and/or it had been in a microwave.  I took one bite and dang near spit it out.  Now, I&#39;m not one to complain about food and have NEVER sent food back, but I did send that one back.  It was horrendous!  The bartender/server was great about taking it back right away, but 5 minutes later they brought out a replacement meal.  It wasn&#39;t as burnt, but was probably the worst Mexican food I have ever had. Wow.  My date said her Tamales were &#34;ok&#34;, but the the beans on her plate were way over cooked and &#39;gluey&#39;.  

I&#39;ll spare any details, but the worst of the experience came a few hours later when my stomach was churning in the middle of the night making me run to the bathroom a couple of times.  &#39;nuff said :(  Ugh.

Besides the food, the whole dining experience kept getting marred by people walking in the front door, through the dining area, and out the back door - using the restaurant as a shortcut through the block.  I was amazed that this was allowed and happened constantly!  It&#39;s like I had a sidewalk at my back and people walking through to get to the parking ramps on the next block over!

Needless to say - I&#39;ll never go back.  I&#39;m sure the back bar area outside is great in the summertime, but for food I will stay far away and would suggest others steer clear."

I&#39;ve been here several times this summer and I always tend to enjoy it. However, there&#39;s a few things I have to address. As a fellow server, I have noticed many things about the poor service. First, servers standing right beside us complaining about other tables. Save that talk for the kitchen, please.

Second: On my previous visit I came with three other friends and we wanted separate checks. We reminded her early when we ordered drinks. She said &#34;okay&#34; but must have not been listening or forgot to split them up. So when the one check arrived we said &#34;can we please get these separate?&#34; She huffs and says &#34;on the bottom of the checks it says we don&#39;t split checks&#34;, with a very nasty attitude. She had grabbed the check at this point and stomped off. Now, as a server I know it can be annoying to take an extra 2 minutes at the POS but it&#39;s so simple that I could have done it for her. Even if that was a policy an ACTUAL policy at Potter&#39;s, that would be totally ridiculous. 

I must note that when she brought back all the checks, including the original, I looked at each to see if it in fact said &#34;no separate checks&#34; and it did not. I was so tempted to not leave a tip after I felt lied to. I wish I still had my receipt so I could call out this blonde server, but I do not."

Anyways, we decided to take our chance and head out there. We were seated promptly and it took 10 minutes before a server even asked us what we wanted to drink. I told him I wanted water and that took another 10 minutes.  Then we asked for chips and salsa and he said they were out. A MEXICAN PLACE OUT OF CHIPS AND SALSA. 

He took our order and he just looked miserable. He was in his 40s, white guy with brown hair and on the shorter side. When he was writing down the order he had one hand resting on our table and he was leaning his head up against it. Apparently we were boring him. If he was so bored then he should have went in the kitchen and made us some chips and salsa ;)

The food was okay. As authentic as you can get for downtown Naperville. Comparable to Chipotle but the horrible service and lack of a basic Mexican complementary item would make me not go back."

All you need to run a successful restaurant is a patio to sell nasty tasting Margaritas with barely any bottom shelf alcohol in them.  Oh, and you need chips that taste a month old- but they&#39;re free, so free=good!

I ordered the street tacos and a tamale, which was a safe bet I guess. The tacos could have been way better, but they could have been way worse too. The tamale was mediocre at best.  

The service was actually pretty decent, probably because we were the only people inside this place. Apparently this place turns into some kind of night club after 9? That also means classy restaurant in Naperville.  It&#39;s also nice how they don&#39;t even have a food menu on their website."

It&#39;s cheap, I&#39;ll give them that, but I could get cheap Mexican food at hundreds of places that tastes infinitely better. And their drink selection is just meh... I think it&#39;s more of a place you&#39;d go if you were already wasted or  divorced and looking to pick someone up for one nighter. Or at least that&#39;s the impression I got when from the crowd when we went. 

Other things I wasn&#39;t impressed by: The service and the cleanliness. I&#39;ll be blunt, if I wanted better service and food in a cleaner environment, I&#39;d order a taco from the heat lamp box at a 7-11. Really, it&#39;s pretty unacceptable stuff. 

One thing I will give them is that they have a great outdoor patio in the summer, though it&#39;s usually full of the divorced trying to pick up the divorced. Maybe if you get a group together so you can dominate the patio and have low expectations about food, it&#39;d be a fine summer hang. Just not my thing though."

The margaritas, for $8, was small and not well poured.  Salsa was fresh, but the chips were garden variety not homemade.  The enchiladas only had one available, red, sauce.  I&#39;m a Verde guy and in today&#39;s Latin food age, it&#39;s a crime not to have some options.  

The beans and rice had to be added as a side (obvious warning not heeded) and they tasted like they were fresh from canned/boxed staples from your local store.

Tamale we tried was pretty good, but nothing for a special sauce on the side to add any flare.  Wife had the Christmas burrito and it was basic and bland, heavily over sour creamed."

No rice and beans with any of the dishes except the tamale dinner, and one small dish of chips and salsa are included with the meal (come on, that probably costs a total of 5 cents). Also, cocktails are small for the price, it just isn&#39;t a good value. All that said, I remember last time I came (years ago) I got the Christmas tree burrito and had a coupon for buy one get one free. They sometimes have those in like the Entertainment books and whatnot.

We came here on a busy weeknight and got seated right away, but that was one of the only pluses. I like that it&#39;s cheap as well. We got a ton of guacamole for around $8. You get about 5 times as much as you would get in the city at the same price. However, it was pretty under seasoned and I had to add quite a bit of salt and hot sauce. Don&#39;t get me started on the chips. Tasted like they were made a week ago. Bland and stale.

I ordered the spinach, mushroom and onion enchiladas for dinner. The portion came with two enchiladas and a crap ton of sour cream. You had to pay $3 on the side though for rice and beans. The enchilada sauce tasted like it came straight from a can. Exactly. Nothing special. The beans were okay, and the rice had an unpleasant under cooked texture and was also bland. Overall, probably wouldn&#39;t come here again unless I wanted a crap ton of guac for cheap. Even then, I would rather make it at home"

After several years in Naperville and a thousand walks past on Jefferson Ave., I went here with a friend for lunch. In short, the +/- breakdown:

Plus:
+ a perfect weather day meant we could sit on the back patio
+ my Mexican tacos (off the appetizer menu, but you can make a combo of three for $8.95); I got shrimp, pastor pork with pineapple, and skirt steak -- all tasty, but all LOADED with cilantro, which I picked off

Minus:
- waitress rushing around, ignoring us most of the time (I have the sense it was because we were two females)
- our orders were slightly wrong (friend ordered her meal with rice and beans, which she didn&#39;t get, and hers was supposed to come with avocado, which it didn&#39;t -- gladly I didn&#39;t want mine -- but we didn&#39;t have time to try to summon the waitress back and get it fixed). Hint to wait staff: WRITE THINGS DOWN!!
- waitress disappeared forever at the end of the meal when we needed the check
- also, stale chips

So yeah, good stuff was mostly about the meal and the setting. Not-so-good stuff was the service. This is really just a bar that happens to have some tasty food and a nice porch. Know that going in and you will have a decent time."

The service was poor as they were understaffed to meet the Saturday night crowd.
Half our group was served 15 minutes after the first  group of plates were brought out.
My biggest gripe was the overpriced and poor quality of the margaritas.
We started off with $32 pitchers but they were  filled  solid with ice and had  no taste of any tequellia.  I brought this to the attention of the waitress and poured some for the bartender to taste. No help from the bartender.  We then asked for stronger pitchers on the next round and were hit with $48  price tag for their double Ultimate margaritas. All I asked for was a stronger pitcher of margaritas, NOT to get ripped off in plain daylight. 
Bottom line. Their food was reasonable priced, but their Margaritas were a joke  for  what was served. 

On a more positive note.........their outdoor music on the  patio  was outstanding. Daredevil Sunday performed and they were lights out ! We switched to beer and shots of Patron, leaving the margaritas far behind as we danced the night away"

I had the shrimp tacos with beans and rice.  I got lots of shrimp, but a very small amount of beans and rice, like 1/4 cup of each.  I&#39;m not sure if they were running out of them or what, but I could have used more of them.

We had a server in training following our server, so there was lots of checking and asking and refilling.  As it should be!

I like the patio and how I got lots of shrimp, but I don&#39;t think there was enough cilantro, lime or enough of any seasoning to call the shrimp tacos Mexican.  The other person I was dining with had the fajita salad and that had lots of flavoring on it, so I&#39;m not sure what happened with the tacos.

The margarita was good, so my next visit will be more chips and alcohol based."

My husband then came up from parking the car and asked the same two girls for a table and we were seated immediately! What is that all about? Really?

Plus, free chips and salsa (as usual with Mexican restaurants, authentic or not) included upon getting seated.

Had the margaritas and at the suggestion of our server, went with frozen raspberry. Consistency and flavor reminded me and my friends of slushy type of sherbet. A little odd but fruity.

Speaking of server, he gave one of my friends a free shot for her birthday. Always a plus.

As for the upstairs level, it was actually quite packed on the weekends on the tiny dance floor, in the booths and on the balcony. The music was recognizable and danceable, but the crowd did not fit with the demographic of me and my friends. A bit older and mostly male."

You get within a block of this fun summertime outside patio and think that it&#39;s going to be a great place for Mexican food and Margaritas. Well, my suggestion is to skip the food and have a few cocktails while the band plays out back. 

When we arrived midweek around 7pm, the hostesses guarding the back patio were in no rush to stop talking to each other to greet us. They looked confused after we gave the small number of two, and said it would be a while so head back to get a drink from the bar. Before we could even get up to the bar tender, one of the bronze beauties told us our table was ready. No problem really because we had time to decide what we wanted to drink and gave our serve a drink order right away. The summer ale we settled on was wonderful. It was one of those true summer nights.

I ended up ordering what seemed to be a difficult order to mess up. Tacos, rice and beans. Well, you can&#39;t win them all. My suggestion? Order a drink at the bar and enjoy a summer night with some live entertainment, and save the Mexican feast for another place."

I suspect this building was once a Tastee Freez or a Dairy Queen, but is now Deri Delite. I pulled up and was quite amused by the vintage building, interesting signage and general feeling of nostalgia for what life might have been like in a time period when I wasn&#39;t actually alive. 

After looking over their menu I noticed they had a hot dog (it was on the Deri Delite sign as well) and decided to order that. A few minutes later my hot dog had arrived at the window and I walked over to one of the benches to sample it. 

The hot dog I received came on a somewhat dry non-poppy seed bun. The hot dog itself was quite large, and was a skinless style of dog. It tasted like the type of hot dog that might be found in a grocery store rather than anything resembling a traditional Chicago style dog. On it was mustard, onions, salsa like tomato and ketchup. Clearly they weren&#39;t trying to make it a the Chicago style dog. There were also jalapeno&#39;s off to the side on the back of the container. I also sampled a jalepeno and it was pretty tasty.

Overall for the price (If I recall correctly it was under 2.00) this wasn&#39;t that bad of a hot dog. But I certainly wouldn&#39;t try it again here or recommend it. It&#39;s quite possible that their ice cream, hamburgers or some of the other items they serve might be better. I like the overall aesthetic of this place a lot, though hot dogs do not seem to be their specialty. Based on my visit I&#39;m going to give them two stars, but this may go up at some point after a return visit. But for now I think it&#39;s appropriate."

Amazing BBQ. The sauces were good but after trying them I actually prefered to eat my food sauceless because the meat is smoked so well. That is a sign of well done BBQ. The guys working there were polite and you can tell they&#39;re passionate about their craft and you can taste it in the food. We tried the brisket, pulled pork, mac n cheese, beans, garlic fries, and cole slaw. Every item was stellar and I was surprised that their sides were just as impressive as their que. They aren&#39;t relying on just a few good menu items with other entries being substandard like most places. This is our new BBQ place."

Nice crust on the burnt ends and the brisket. You get the smoke too. Not the most tender I&#39;ve ever had, but not bad by any means.

The mac n cheese is cavatappi pasta covered in a thin, smoky, nacho cheese-like sauce. The sauce is well seasoned and flavorful, but it tasted like they didn&#39;t salt the pasta water. Sorry, but you&#39;re not going to please this Italian with your mac n cheese if you can&#39;t cook your pasta right.

Coleslaw was just how I like it, creamy with some good vinegar bite and a lot of pepper. Paired well with the brisket and burnt ends.

Of all the sauces I liked the original sweet bbq and the Texas hot sauce the best on the brisket. I tried all of them. I imagine the white sauce would be perfect for chicken. For pulled pork the Georgia mustard and Carolina vinegar is a no-brainer. 

Good enough to send me back to try the ribs, chicken, hot links, and other sides."

Firewater was just &#34;OK&#34; by our expectations.  We saw the good reviews, so we were disappointed when we went.  

The service was 5-star for sure though.  The staff was friendly, very helpful during the ordering process, fast, and fun.  I would go back just for the experience the staff gave.

As far as food, I would give 5 stars for the sauces and the onion rings.  I loved every sauce they had, made me want to put a straw in the bottles and just drink them!  The onion rings were tasty and crispy.

The rest of the food was just ok, nothing to make a special trip for.  Everything tasted good when we added sauce, but the brisket, pork, and ribs didn&#39;t have the kind of flavor we were looking for just on their own.  The meat seemed to lack the smokiness and rich bbq flavor.  Boring is probably the best term.  
We got the fresh cut fries with a combo of their garlic and cajun mixed together.  It was very salty, and had a strong oregano flavor.  They were pretty oily and limp.  I&#39;d try them again with just salt and see if that would be better for me.  
We don&#39;t plan on going back because of the blah meat flavor.  

If you normally add sauce to your bbq meat, then I would highly recommend firewater."

I&#39;m not sure what happened; last time I came here, I remember this place being better. So my wife and I had a taste for wings &amp; I recall that they had on the menu &#34;Jumbo&#34; BBQ wings so we made the travel. On the way there, I decided to call the order in so I wouldn&#39;t wait as long when I got there. A young girl picked up the phone, put me on hold &amp; never came back; 10 minutes later I decided to just hang up &amp; call again, line was busy. Therefore, by the time I got there, I was already a little agitated.

Anyway, this place is owned by a couple. The husband does majority of the Q&#39;ing &amp; the wife usually does sides &amp; greeting the customers at the counter. First off, the wall menu is highly confusing. The main entrees are scattered on both sides of the menu &amp; the sides are shown at the beginning. Therefore, you have to do a little back &amp; forth to complete your meal; there are also some items in the paper menu that&#39;s not on the wall menu (like the fries).

Customer service is lacking here. I quickly learned what happened over the phone earlier. The young girl taking orders picks up the cordless phone, put it down then goes to doing other stuff. While I was putting in my order, I saw her look at the phone, saw that it was still on then hung it up (likely my call from earlier). I kindly asked the wife owner about if they take call ins &amp; she abruptly told me that they usually don&#39;t even pick up the phone on Fridays!

Anyways, here&#39;s the most important part, taste! First off, the &#34;jumbo&#34; wings are NOT jumbo! They&#39;re your typical little wingettes that you get in a bag at Aldi. I felt cheated. The baked beans tasted weird like something was wrong with the brisket they put in there; additionally, my wife had a long HAIR in hers (probably from that rude owner). I was disappointed by both my service &amp; meal. Needless to say, I will NOT be back!"

Time of my visit: Afternoon

My girlfriend recommended this place, she saw them at DuPage County Fair.  So we decided to go there Sunday afternoon.

We ordered 2 and 3 meat combos, which came with a side and a drink.  The meats we chose were ribs, wing and brisket.  Everything they do is smoked and in my mind it would be either a hit or a miss and they hit it out of the park.  The only thing I would do different next time is get all drumsticks for my wings.  It&#39;s a personal choice, I just don&#39;t like anything other then drumsticks.

The staff was very polite and easy going, engaging and accommodating.  They had a nice choice of teas, which I prefer over fountain drinks.

I would defiantly go there again, but I will try differ side next time as I was not a fan of the Cajun fries, but again, I am a weirdo when it comes to that.

Defiantly a sold B, with staff getting an A!  I highly recommend the place!  See you next time!"

It&#39;s small and seating is in short supply, but it&#39;s comfortable and cozy. There was enough room for a fellow with his guitar performing surprisingly good music to an appreciative audience. You could still carry on a conversation, too. But the food - YUM! We both ordered the brisket sandwich with two sides and a drink. I got sweet potato fries and a salad. This is so much food but I didn&#39;t want to stop.. the brisket is tender and tasty and there are several sauces to apply - not just some overly sweet tomatoey version, either, but well crafted complementary sauces. Nice and spicy hot, too. The fries were not my favorite - they were dusted with cinnamon sugar and I am decidedly not a fan of sweet things, especially when I feel they should be savory. But the salad was great. Hubby got fried pickles - what! - but I guess they were good; he enjoyed them right up. I will most definitely be back for the food and ambience or I&#39;ll just get it to go if the place is packed!"

I couldn&#39;t decide if I had been here before or after Baby Back Blues BBQ. I just recall having BBQ from this location and thinking it sucked. 

Long story short it was Baby Back Blues that really sucked.

Rib Tips - 12 piece for $10. The main thing I liked was that they actually had some meat on the bone. (although one of tips literally was two bones with a thin piece of fat in between the two) 

Grillmaster burger - First why did I order this huge thing? Portion wise. You get your money&#39;s worth. Was fresh off the grill so hot although I don&#39;t recall being asked how I wanted it done it was cooked fine for me. However I didn&#39;t enjoy the pull pork on it. Needed to be chopped up much thinner. I kind of had to drown the burger in BBQ sauce. Although I doubt I would order it again. I must repeat compared to a lot of burger joints I&#39;ve been to lately that charge $8-$16 for a burger...you get your money&#39;s worth.

Onion Rings - Beer battered? I&#39;m not 100% sure they aren&#39;t just frozen out of bag but they were GOOD! Crispy on the outside and nice flavor on the inside.

BBQ - Only tried 2 our 5(?) BBQ sauce. Sweet Home Chicago Which was nice and the Texas Heat Loved both (Last 2 BBQ places I&#39;ve been to I hated the sauce)"

Liked it, didn&#39;t love it on pretty much all levels. The day I went it was insanely smoky...but...it&#39;s a barbecue joint so can I really fault them for this? Nah. But did it confuse me and make me think I may die of smoke inhalation? Yep. I&#39;m a baby.

I had the free range pulled chicken combo which comes with 2 sides and a drink for $9.45 ~ not a bad deal at all. The chicken was insanely moist which was good but I only really liked 1 of their 5 sauce options. This is a personal taste preference type of thing but I wasn&#39;t super into their mild sauce which was disappointing for me. Their fries were good, though nothing in particular stood out about them to me. I was not feeling their mac &amp; cheese at all. Slightly overcooked noodles, didn&#39;t like the cheese flavor, nor it just being thrown on top of half the noodles. Pretty sure they used pimento cheese in their &#39;3 Cheese Mac &amp; Cheese&#39; as their were also tiny peppers in the mix. I wouldn&#39;t have got this side if I knew about the pimentos. I&#39;m a mac &amp; cheese lover, so &#39;twas a sad time for me when I wasn&#39;t feeling this. 

I must say the staff was super friendly in their dealings with other customers. I heard them joking around, offering kids to take a look behind the counter, just really good service from the staff at Firewater.

Ribs were the real star of the show.   They were cooked perfectly and just the right level of doneness with crisp skin there.   

Pulled Pork was the disappointment - it had no smoky flavor, bark and  was watered down.   

Brisket was good with a nice smoke ring and cooked perfectly.

I have been to the good and the bad BBQ places and they have elements of the good and the bad places all in one which makes this a hard review but I will be honest and fair.

I was in the area and saw 4 stars with 82 reviews so it must be good. A good sign as I walk in because I smell smoke which means real BBQ.

I think they were looking for a hip retro look with the colorful walls that has old gas pumps and old cars painted on them. The place only has tables and chairs for seating. There is a serve your self soft drink machine with a good variety.

I order the baby back full rack combo which is ribs, 2 sides and a drink. My sides were Mac and cheese with bacon and chive potato salad.

The Mac and cheese was made right in front of me. There is a steam table where the guy takes a ladle and pours cheese sauce into the container while he takes plain cooked pasta from the steam table and puts that in the container and finishes it off with another ladle of cheese sauce. I have never heard or seen that technic before.

While waiting for my food I start looking around and notice the floor has a film of grease that I&#39;m sliding on. The tables looked like a wet cloth was used to clean the greasy BBQ and just spread it all over. Overall the place needs a cleaning. Every bag box and container had greasy finger prints or sloppy spilled food on them, see my pictures.

Now to the food. I got my ribs with the sauce on the side so I could judge the meat on its own. I actually like the sauce because it was sweet and tangy with a little heat at the end. The Mac and cheese was ok with a creamy cheese sauce that didn&#39;t have that melty real cheese texture. The potato salad was ok with baby reds and dill with that same little heat at the end.

The baby back ribs were weird 2-3 bone sections Frankensteind together to look like a full slab, see my pictures. The ribs had a nice looking caramelized bark with bits of pink meat showing. The bones pull off the meat with ease. My first thought was that the ribs were very tasty because they were sweet, smokey with that end heat once again. They were slightly dry and were not just made but good, see what I mean about potential. The ribs are on the right track for greatness and I would love to have a just cooked rack to update my review.

This is one of my hardest reviews but I am always honest in my reviews. This place has 5 star potential because the food is not bad and I would buy these ribs again but I wanted to give 2 stars. The BBQ is better than 2 stars so I&#39;m going to cut some slack and give 3 stars. The sloppiness with the food and the general cleanliness can be fixed. 

This place has the potential to be a power hitter with their BBQ for the area and all the yelp reviews are proof of that, clean it up guys and work on the presentation of your food."

I got into barbecue in Kentucky. That style is not common around here but I do love that Chicago embraces a variety of styles. And really, it&#39;s meat first, then sauce.

Firewater starts with basics and then adds on some house specialties. My husband went for the RD3 sandwich, a monster smoked chicken creation with cheese, bacon, sauce and fried pickles. He said it was great.

I got the Texas taco trio, one of each pork, chicken and beef. They are loaded and covered in delicious toppings. My one critique is that one flimsy corn tortilla is not strong enough to hold all that, maybe double them up.

The meat is definitely well cooked, super tender and the sauces I tried were well done. Love the variety on offer, they had seven different styles.

Oh, and the sides. I stuck with fries. One cajun, one garlic. Freshly fried and seasoned, and that cajun is not messing around, it has serious spice. 

The guys in the shop were friendly and helpful and I&#39;d be happy to eat in, get more meat and try more of their tasty sounding sides.

But vegetarians be wary: this place is not veggie friendly, beyond some of the sides. All the mains are meat-tastic."

Well today was piss poor. I hate to say this because I understand people have a bad day. I work in the industry, but this woman that gave me my to go order was yelling at this young worker saying everything he did wrong and I asked for extra bbq sauce and she said it wasn&#39;t possible. Leaving me very confused. I spent over 50$ there you&#39;d think they would be accommodating. I hate to say this review but if I own a start up business I&#39;d want to know. Keep your &#34;sassy&#34; employees in back and now on display for your customers to hear all your dirty laundry and how your staff actually treats newer employees"

My last visit want pleasant. My husband and I ordered the 6 jumbo bbq chicken and 2 side which was baked beans and fries. The chicken was small and I only had 2 pieces of chicken. I had baked bean and found a piece of hair in it and it wasn&#39;t my hair. My fries was very salty.

This biggest problem is they don&#39;t accepted call in orders on Fridays. According to them the are too busy to answer phone call. If you call, they will put you on hold and never return. They have terrible customers service.  Best advices is to never come to this place."

I had certain expectation and they totally met them. I had the brisket sandwich with seasoned garlic fries and sweet potato fries. I couldn&#39;t decide. The meat was tender yet crispy. The roll was soft and chewy. The fries were crispy and packed full of flavor. Perhaps the sweet potato fries had a tad bit much of the sugar or whatever they sprinkled on it. Just a bit too sweet, but good nonetheless. 

My only negative point is the wait time. It took about 15-20 minutes to get my food. Now in fairness there was only one guy cooking and he was wearing a cast. And afterwards they apologized for the wait which I appreciated. It was also the end of lunch time so there was a rush. If you come around noon time I suggest being ready to wait at least 15 minutes. 

Overall, and despite the long wait, the food was great and the staff was friendly. I plan to go again for the best BBQ in this part of the burbs (if not the whole city ;-) ) Plenty more things I want to try."

I was browsing those &#34;Local Flavor&#34; deals (similar to groupons) and noticed there was a Firewater in Lombard, so I bought it.  I finally made my way over there last night.

They&#39;re located in a strip mall on Roosevelt Rd.  Their sign was not lit last night so I&#39;m wondering if that why it wasn&#39;t crowded at all... but no complaints, the service was quick, and friendly!

My friend and I ordered the meal with the extra meat...based on the reviews on here, I ordered brisket, she got pulled pork (or chicken) I can&#39;t recall... but for sides, we split the fried pickles and sweet potato fries - they were all so so good!!! I suggest ordering the extra meat, it&#39;s not too much either...especially if you&#39;re eating it open faced without the bread as I did.

Great BBQ here!!! I&#39;m not even a big fan of pickles, but the fried ones were very good!  The sweet potato fries were sprinkled lightly with brown sugar or cinnamon or something that you could taste a hint of... I&#39;m definitely a fan of this place now!"

I chose sweet potato fries which were totally fresh with brown sugar sprinkled over it. They are delicious plain, but I paired it up with their mustard sauce which is oh so mouthwatering! The cornbread is soft and only $1 each! I came with a friend who ordered Mac n cheese which was also perfect. Amazing customer service and plenty of seats. Definitely a place to check out if you&#39;re looking for some good ol&#39; Southern food in the western suburbs of Chicago!"

Unfortunately, it turned out to be average at best. One of my friends had claimed that this was the best barbecue spot he&#39;s ever had. He claimed it was equivalent to Pappys in St. Louis. Clearly this guy has no clue what he&#39;s talking about. 

The good: Price is reasonable. It is in a good location with parking. The portions are good. And they have a Wednesday rib special which is four dollars off of an order. The burnt ends are extremely soft and good.The staff is ridiculously friendly and help me out because it was my first time.

The bad: barely any smoke flavor. Lack of seasoning. Needs a better rub. People always say they want to fall off the bone in rib. Well this place is where to get it. Unfortunately those people don&#39;t know what a good ribs are. A good rib should have a bit of pull to it when you eat it. Should have a wonderful smoke ring as well. Unfortunately this place does not meet my standards for ribs. I also had the burnt ends. They were huge for some reason. Each was about the size of a 2 inch cube. When I think of burnt ends I want just that just the trimmings off of the brisket.however I could definitely overlook this because of the texture of the burnt ends themselves. They were quite silky and melted in my mouth. I would have preferred a little bit of a chew. But that&#39;s OK.

Overall it&#39;s an OK place to go. I don&#39;t know if I will come back. It&#39;s a pretty decent option when you are sick of everything else around there. Or if you want average barbecue food."

Bbq dry and both my order and my husband&#39;s order was messed up. My burger was missing both the pulled pork AND bacon. When I called to get a new order (we carried out) they offered me free bacon on my next visit?

The entire restaurant was a smoke house, not sure what is up with the vent system and the floors and tables were sticky. 

Seems like the staff is under experience and lacking supervision. 

Pretty bummed because this is close to my house."

Everything tasted great even when they are warm, and their signature sauce is pretty good too. We were the only customers Thursday at around 8pm, one person singing, one cashier and one person making the meat. We ordered a 3-meat platter for $18 and the portion was just perfect for two people. The only drawback was they had everything prepared and didn&#39;t heat up well so all the meat were just warm. You know that it feels different when you bite on a juicy hot rib instead of a greasy(with cold fat on it) warm one. The pulled chicken was not juicy at all probably because it is just room temperature. But we still finished it with ZERO left, idk maybe because I&#39;m too hungry after a long road trip and a bad day.

I think I can probably get a better bbq when they make it fresh. That&#39;s why I&#39;m not giving it 3-star. But to be honest I was still a little disappointed. The service was very good though. All of them were friendly and nice. So I didn&#39;t wanna mention the problem to them.

But yeah, you should call before coming here so you know they are making fresh bbq and I could imagine that&#39;s going to rock the hell out of the meat bugs in your stomach.

Cornbread just soso, out of a plastic wrap makes it cheap and not moist enough.

Small bugs flying around.

Price not bad.

Free pickles and peppers.

That&#39;s it, enjoy your visit and thanks for reading my review."

Being in Illinois were not known for bbq and I&#39;ve never had &#34;real&#34; bbq but this brisket is exactly what I think real bbq would taste like, it was extremely good, the pulled pork was okay, the beans were good as well, baby back blues in Plainfield has better beans, also the garlic fries were good. The brisket was so good it didn&#39;t need sauce , but.. All the sauces were amazing , Carolina, mustard , Chicago , Texas and Alabama white (I&#39;ve never had white sauce before, I loved it) .

First time there , wanted to get a couple of items that I would be able to compare with my more familiar / favorite type of bbq. Ordered slab of ribs and a hot link. First I thought the ribs were more chewy and not fall of the bone. The link was of a different style than I had ever tasted. The wife liked the link. It was not spicy and that would have been ok for me otherwise. It was the texture that surprised me. It was homemade the menu stated. I have to say that the bbq sauces were plentiful,  but most not to my taste. I had wanted to try this place, since it is close to home. I have to say I prefer bbq from black owned carry out.

After only 1 minute I would of hung up and used someone else for how RUDE Nick was. But again I wanted to please my office staff.

I asked him if he can go over his catering menu (since they don&#39;t have it posted online)... &#34;He then goes well what do you want?&#34; Well since they don&#39;t have a menu posted how would I even know what I could order. So I explained to him I have a staff of 16 and since they don&#39;t have a menu online can he point me in the right direction.... Let&#39;s just say the RUDENESS got even worse.

I then informed him that I am trying to place a large order for his restaurant and trying to understand why he&#39;s rude. Then explains he&#39;s not being rude. I then ask to speak to another employee who he could be more helpful.

No matter if the food is the best I ever have, I will not be going back or using this restaurant again. My experience is beyond negative and I haven&#39;t even picked up my food yet. 

Note to Nick: always be humble and kind, because no one every regrets in life for being kind. Rudeness takes up so much energy.

Due to nicks actions I hope others will use another restaurant for there catering. No one deserves to be talked to the way I was.

I tried it again over the weekend and it&#39;s really improved. There have been upgrades to the dining room and it&#39;s much less smoky and feels much more cozy and inviting. 

New management is on the ball and it&#39;s now every bit as good as it&#39;s counterpart in Crest Hill. Which is to say, I truly feel it&#39;s the best BBQ anywhere around Chicago

This BBQ is indeed good. The sauce selection was plenty and they were delicious as well!

If someone asked me for a good BBQ joint in the west burbs I would direct them here.

Came in the day after Christmas, and they had live music - a great blues artist which really made the place feel like a southern blues BBQ place...perfect.

This isn&#39;t Smoque, which unfortunately for Firewater was my most recent BBQ, but it&#39;s a lot better than anything around where I live in Forest Park.  The baby back ribs were perfectly cooked, with a sauce that didn&#39;t overwhelm them.  The smoked wings were a little dry, but tasty, and even better when I ate my leftovers cold later in the day.  The fries (we had the Cajun) were, as others have noted, excellent.  The cornbread was so good that I bought a second slice to take home.  

What pushes this to four stars is the very reasonable pricing (again, of course, comparing it to Smoque or some of the other high-end BBQ places).  I was going to get a half slab for $11.99 when I realized that for $15.99 I could get that half slab, plus another meat (I chose the wings), plus a side, plus a drink.  Extra sides (I also recommend the fried pickles) were only $2.00 and that fabulous cornbread was only $1.00.  

Usually on that strip of Roosevelt I&#39;m thinking Middle Eastern.  But this is a welcome change.  I look forward to sampling the rest of the menu."

Called first to confirm they had gluten free options. The person who answered the phone did not hesitate and immediately talked about all the options available to me and provided a disclaimer about what to be careful to avoid. A very good sign. 

The brisket was really good. All the sauces were gluten free and I tried most of them. Digging the Texas style, but Chicago style was my favorite. My cousin had the pulled pork on a pretzel bun and said it was great. The sides were not the best, but I&#39;ll definitely be back to try the pulled pork and for some more brisket."

We had BBQ combos with pulled pork, wings and rib tips.  Sides were fries, onion rings, creamy slaw and bacon/chive potato salad.  I got a few pieces of cornbread for the side and some mac n cheese for my sons.  Sauces on the table are great too.

This place suffers from a bad layout that so many restaurants seem to suffer.  When I went, there were people standing in the middle of the aisle, blocking the way.  It&#39;s awkward getting your food and getting to the drink station is also a chore.  You would think these things would be considered, but I guess part of the problem are the guests that have zero self awareness and don&#39;t realize they are standing in the damn aisle.  Or they just give no f&#39;s.

The food is good though.  This will probably become our go to bbq place for lunch.  Service was a little slow, but there were no customers.  Hopefully the lunch won&#39;t take over an hour even if there are more customers present.

The brisket was great.  I didn&#39;t have the rib tips but someone got them and he said they were good.  The pulled pork was also said to be top notch.  The meat had a nice smoky layer to it, but the inside of the brisket was perfect.

They have a dinner option which gets you a side or two.  They were out of the mac and cheese when we went (really?)

4 different sauces.  Can&#39;t remember them off hand but I think other reviewers have got that covered.

Go check it out though.  I will be back."

We found this gem last year driving down Roosevelt and decided to grab some to go...we were not disappointed! The pulled pork sammi is out of bounds, but my go-to is hands down the tacos - YEP taco&#39;s in a BBQ joint! The meat here is always fresh, tender and super flavorful and the BBQ sauces are beyond delish! The man always gets a 3 meat combo and loves each meat option, especially the bacon!

The mac &amp; cheese was slightly spicy and had a great deal of flavor as well (I was worried at first because the cheese is liquid). I was not a fan of the chili, but I have very specific tastes when it comes to chili. It was made from brisket and was slightly sweet; I&#39;m more of a spicy ground beef/venison kind of chili-eater. Of the 5 sauces on the table, I liked 4 of them (not a huge Alabama White fan). My favorites were the house original sauce and, of course, the Texas Heat sauce.

They were smoked well, tender and did not fall off the bone like pre-boiled ribs (not a fan of that), but rather pulled off easily. WE tried the different sauces, the hot was VERY hot and tangy which I loved. A little too hot for my wife. The mustard BBQ was my second favorite. We ordered the three cheese mac and sweet potato fries as sides. These were ok, but wasn&#39;t big on the seasoning on the fries. The place wasn&#39;t as dirty as some of the other reviews state, but the floors were kind of greasy. Also, the seating area is tight.

I walked in to find Adam Levine and Brett Michaels behind the counter. Or at least their doppelgängers. Brett seemed friendly and welcomed me. But then he disappeared leaving Adam&#39;s twin to take my order. 

Adam wasn&#39;t friendly. Adam didn&#39;t want to take my order. Adam kinda grumbled and muttered and reluctantly took it. 

I don&#39;t know why he seemed in such a mood. 

I ordered a South Sider with the bacon/bleu cheese pasta salad and the garlic fries. DON&#39;TJUDGE! 

It came out and the first thing I noticed was the fact that my bun was completely burned. Burnt-edge BBQ is tasty, but the bun isn&#39;t supposed to be blackened, the meat is. Yuck. I tossed that off to the side and ate the meat with a fork. The brisket was leathery and tasteless, so I doused it with some of the apple bourbon bbq sauce. The sauce was delicious. Not too sweet and not too sticky, with a nice flavor. 

The pasta salad came in a container about the size of a double-shot glass. It was tiny for the (normally) $2 price tag, but I got the combo, which actually made it $1. It was dry and flavorless. Tasted like cold congealed noodles with a couple chunks of bleu cheese and some limp tasteless bacon. To make this edible, I used the white lightning sauce to spice it up. 

The white lightning sauce is magical. I&#39;ve never had anything like it. And honestly, I considered buying a pint to take home. I may go back. Truly, Firewater excels in the sauces and that&#39;s about it.

My garlic fries were also over-cooked, so it was once again sauce to the rescue. I tried a bit of the spicy sauce and like the other two, this was also quite good, and I used a little more of that to flavor up the pulled pork. 

The pork itself was fine. It was moist and had a nice mouth-feel. It wasn&#39;t too fatty, so I was satisfied. But it was unseasoned and pretty forgettable. I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to order it again. 

Overall, Firewater&#39;s food is mediocre. The service was lacking. The value was weak as far as sides go. And 3 of the items I ordered were overcooked, with one actually being burned. 

After eating here, I&#39;m feeling pretty burned myself. But thankfully, their amazing sauces save the day, and save this review from being one star."

My favorite was their spicy BBQ sauce which was tangy,sweet and had just the right kick.  I didn&#39;t order any sides, but saw they had a nice selection.

Here&#39;s a tip if you want more flavor and aren&#39;t a health nut.  They trim off the fat before serving your brisket.  Ask them to skip that step so you get all all that rich goodness.  I mean, who goes for BBQ looking for something healthy?"

They had Italian beef but no bread. Atleast a roll or something. The alfredo pasta wasn&#39;t bad but also didn&#39;t seem fresh. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be returning."

They did not skimp on any ingredients...if your &#34;go-to&#34; deep dish pizza is Giordano&#39;s this place is similar but 10x better and it&#39;s not salty like Giordano&#39;s.  The flavor of Zazzo&#39;s sauce is a bit sweet and perfect, tons of cheese and the crust was delicious.  Would definitely go back as this the best place in the southwest suburbs for sure.

We had italian beef, sausages, roasted potatoes and some sort of cake brownie. I didn&#39;t eat a sausage, but everything else seemed to be a big hit at the office. But of course, food is food.

The italian beef wasn&#39;t amazing, but still italian beef that was decent. The roasted potatoes were good, but the skin could&#39;ve been crispy..it was just soggy. The cake brownie was good, but nothing I wouldn&#39;t taken a second helping of. Overall, a good change from the usual (every rep brings Chili&#39;s for some reason), but not something I would actively pick."

I didn&#39;t know this place existed previously, and was excited to see new ordering options online! I ordered pepperoni pizza bread ($4.10) and a BBQ chicken salad ($8.50). 

The pepperoni pizza bread, even with delivery came hot, crispy, and was a large portion. I was expecting 6 inches of Italian bread, but it being a loaf cut in half only providing me the one side. I was pleasantly surprised to be provided both halves of the bread.

The salad feels like it weighs 5lb! That thing is loaded with BBQ chicken, cheese, beans, corn and lettuce. I only tried a few bites, but it&#39;s going to be awesome (maybe just a little heavy on the BBQ sauce side of things). Their salad dressings look house-made too.

Awesome delivery experience that left me wanting to check the place out! I will be there soon!!!"

I can tell I&#39;m not the &#39;regular&#39; as many are, but they definitely recognize me when I come in.  Usually Carissa is behind the bar and she&#39;s such a sweetheart and great to chat with.  I have had their pizza twice.  The first time it actually wasn&#39;t great.  It had too much sauce and not enough flavor but the second time it was really good.  They also have a surprisingly good Caesar salad.  The only item we were not fans of were the pretzel bites.  I&#39;d pass on those but almost anything else will be good.  They have really good onion rings and chicken fingers.  It&#39;s bar food but better than most other places serving similar fare.  Cheesy breadsticks are another good option.  They also recently redid their wine list and have some really solid options that aren&#39;t too expensive.  We are definitely here a decent amount and will continue to frequent."

Delivery time was above average, around 45 minutes. The pizza as a whole seemed above average in every aspect. The crust had a nice crunch and wasn&#39;t overdone. The right amount of sauce, with a hint of sweet. The cheese was slightly browned, and the rest of the toppings, sausage, onions, green peppers, married in harmony. For thin crust in the Willowbrook area, it&#39;s a close race between Zazzo&#39;s and Rosati&#39;s. Jet&#39;s &amp; Giordano&#39;s offer great pie, just different styles."

First the own Dominic is very accommodating and made the ordering a breeze. We ordered for my daughters baptism and after all of the phone calls from picky relatives we just used them for my daughters graduation.  The chicken is moist,well seasoned,and about the best chicken I&#39;ve ever eaten. The beef received one of the best compliments . My sister in law called me the next day ,after taking a huge bag home ,that she liked this beef better than Portillos!. More than enough food to feed my entire group and then some.

The waitress is always so friendly and checks on us often. When I go without my son I sometimes enjoy a cold beer served by the bartender, Abby. 
The only bad experience I&#39;ve ever had there was about a year ago when I had lunch there w my son. A couple guys got up and moved to the bar area because they were offended a child was there. I felt very uncomfortable and the manager didn&#39;t help that at all as he started being standoff ish and kind of rushed us out (he sent the waitress over with our check after we had only been there 15 mins or so) there wasn&#39;t a shift change and they&#39;ve never done that before or since so I know it was to rush us out.

Thin crust:  A little bit of crisp to the crust, and not much flavor honestly... it was a bit bland... but the big points here go to the plethora of toppings and the quality!  Zazzo&#39;s special has sausage, onions, peppers, and mushroom... and they all tasted phenomenal!  (No canned mushrooms here!)  

Deep dish:  Similarly, the crust was bland, and airy.  My wife liked this crust better than Giordanos, but I respectfully have to disagree.  You want a great deep dish?  Go get Malnatis... they make it okay, but it&#39;s not something I&#39;d go out of my way for.

Verdict:  Pretty decent thin crust, OK deep dish."

You have to mention that you want it before we run your card&#34;. In that case what is the point of having daily specials?

Went there last night, 6/2, and sat at the bar in their new dining area.  We were the only ones in the place but were told a large group was arriving in 40 minutes.  Ordered our pizza and it took 30 minutes to arrive.  Strange as I order on the phone and pick up in 20.  Perhaps they&#39;re trying to sell drinks?  The bartender had never been behind a bar in his life but was a nice guy.  I felt sorry for him actually.  Then the kids arrived.  About 30 junior hockey players that were given free reign on the dining area.  Decibel level was akin to front row at a Stones concert.  Staff was totally in the weeds.  Took forever to get our check, observed a few people just get up and leave.  ADVICE TO OWNERS:  close the dining room and just do carryout.  You are in way over your heads and obviously are not restaurant people.  It&#39;s harder than it looks."

While no pie has been able to completely replace the glory of a provel-covered St. Louie pie, Zazzo&#39;s comes the closest and is a more than satisfactory supplement.  

Quality ingredients and technical know-how are evident qualities of this place, and I can happily recommend it to any and all (unlike some other places in the area- I&#39;m looking at you Falco&#39;s!!)

UPDATE:  After the recent change in ownership, I&#39;m afraid to say that the quality of pies here has dropped significantly (very bland!!).    When considering the high price point in play here, I can no longer recommend this place and am dropping my rating from 5 to 1 star."

We decided to eat at rhe bar and order a pizza.  Quick and friendly bartender and very clean bar area, very comfortable granite bar. Plenty of TVs to keep up with the game as I was hoping to catch a little of the playoffs.
The beer choices were great, all kinds of bottled and several drafts.  I had a wine and my friend had a draft both were great.  We ordered the mozzarella cheese sticks as an appetizer till our BBQ chicken pizza came.  The sticks were perfect, hot and crisp with a flavorful sauce.  The small pizza was a big size and excellent plenty of chicken and a sweet sauce also the crust was the best part. Not familiar with the former place but this was a good experience. The price was a bargain for the value of service and food. Will be back for sure!!"

The pizza simply lacks some flavor.  Sure, if you throw toppings on it, that will mask the issue.  But a simple cheese pizza is just plain.  The sauce lacks substance as does the crust.  

I&#39;m from NY so I tend to be critical of many Chicago pizza&#39;s, but this doesn&#39;t even measure up to other Chicago pizza in my mind.  Nice people there, but they need to work on the sauce to give it more flavor, and they need to improve the crust too."

I&#39;m more of a deep dish pizza guy myself so for whatever reason, I decided to order a thin crust and an order of lasagna. First the pizza. It won me over. I ordered a large sausage, mushroom, onion and green pepper. I waited and that was 20 of the quickest minutes I&#39;ve experienced of recent. I knew I had their pizza (by way of a friend picking it up) but it had been many years. No regrets here. The lasagna is SOLID!!! I mean eat and take a nap solid. Nice balance of cheese and sauce (of course I ordered meat sauce). They also have weekday dining specials ranging from ravioli &amp; lasagna as well as pizza (currently 2 slices &amp; a drink for $6.00)

I went on the last day to use my groupon. Here&#39;s another example of why I don&#39;t get the problem other people are having. I came in during lunch (lunch is Wed-Friday 11:AM- 1:30 pm and reopen at 4:PM). I presented my groupon to the guy at the counter (who I figured out was the owner- nice guy). Another regular came in while I was waiting and he noticed that I just used my groupon. The owner told him how happy he was with how it all turned out for him. I can sense sarcasm and there was none in his voice. He mentioned that for what he had to pay, the cost was pretty low especially in the long run. The groupon got them in the door and since then, he noticed a jump in increased return customer rate. I got a good deal, he got more people through (and returning to) the doors of his business. Everyone wins!!!

While this was short &amp; sweet, it&#39;s enough for me to want to visit again. Now the trick, I seem to find many places off the beat and path. This could be another example. If you&#39;re familiar where Willowbrook Ford is, Zazzo&#39;s Pizza is directly across the street. I&#39;m not near there often but I would return to try their deep dish or another pasta. It&#39;s a pretty small place so if you want to eat in, you may be in close quarter (not to the point of uncomfortably though). You have a long bench and 4 or 5 tables to sit at. Bottom line- a positive experience and I will return."

The minute my phone call was answered, I thought I was bidding on my pizza pie because the girl who answered the phone was speed talking.
I placed my order with with pure panic for fear of jumbling my words.

I could barely finish ordering my pizza pie as she was telling me my total that would be ready in 15 minutes. Before she rudely hung up on me, I had to tell her I also wanted a salad and drinks. She then told me my new total in .1 second and again told me it would be ready in 15 minutes. Phone call ended.

This order was meant for delivery, but sadly my address was never taken. Therefore panicked phone call # 2 was placed to the bitter girl taking the order:-/

Well, then this is the place for you!  Hop into Zazzo&#39;s for Italian delights and more!

But seriously, I had lunch here with work the other day, and was pleasantly surprised.  We ordered the hot giardinera peppers with pepperoni pizza, and holy hell my mouth was on devil fire after eating it... But it was so good.  The kinda hot you just can&#39;t resist.  And the kinda hot that gives you a mild case of heartburn, but that&#39;s another story.

So, I haven&#39;t tried any of their other entrees, but everyone seemed to be pretty satisfied with what they had ordered.  

Prices seem pretty standard, if not a little pricey--- at least for ordering out for lunch.  Our small pizza (12&#34;) was about $15.00.  Lasagna and the like runs about $8.00.  

So, once I dry clean my pizza dripped on clothes, I&#39;ll probably stop there again sometime.  :P"

This place reminds me of home and now this... this...is my new coffee &#39;home&#39; while I live in the area for a bit. Delicious. 

My top recommendations -

1. Breakfast Torta with Steak 5/5. Bread was soft and flaky, steak was seasoned perfectly, egg was cooked just right, and the cheese made my heart melt ;) 

2. Cold brew. Dare I say it: this is legit the *best* cold brew I&#39;ve ever had. This is 100% their MVP. Even their contraption of brewing it is interesting to look at. I had to taste it, of course! 

3. Rice pudding. Wow. It was really, really good; reminded me of my grandmother&#39;s rice pudding. I was feeling incredibly nostalgic with every bite and I genuinely appreciated this gem.

Thing I would avoid -

Cafe con leche de la casa. Weak sauce. I tasted significantly more milk than coffee which made my coffee taste more like water. I had to ask for a shot of espresso to add in. Next time, I&#39;ll stick with the cold brew or get a hot espresso based drink. 

One other thing to know -

This place gets busy and since there are only two workers here, you may wait a bit. But good things come to those who wait. So have patience and thank me after you have your first sip!

¡Salud!"

Great coffee.

Unique because they grow their own coffee, roast their own coffee, brew and sell their own coffee. Owners are true experts. Hard to find a place that does it all.

They&#39;re going to be having events, live music and poetry readings in the future. I&#39;m looking forward to that.

The location is very convenient and the whole place looked clean and well decorated. The girl at the register was not helpful at all and is in need of training. Their coffee is decent. Their chai tea latte is watery and I would highly suggest against the tamale- it has the consistency and sweetness of cake.

My associates and I were asked a few times without demand, if things were good, if any thing else was required. A little goes a long way. 

I could see this place booming and it always seems to have some sort of traffic and business coming in and out of the doors. In my opinion, a tremendous step up from Starbucks or any other coffee shop, with even better prices.

You do not need to spend more to get more.  This establishment makes that ring true. Will be back. Try them out and hopefully you all are able to experience it as well as we have.

Since they grow their own beans, they obviously use good quality beans , while a good friend of mine whose family has been in the coffee business forever has said that Starbucks buys cheaper quality beans. I also like that you can get a made from scratch hot meal here - mostly Mexican food like tortas and tostadas. I got a breakfast torta - soooooo good. Eggs, peppers, onions on the softest bread. Ive been here three times in the last 3 days."

Alejandro, the most kind and hospitable owner, grows his own beans on his family plantation and meticulously roasts his coffee beans on premises here at Cafe La Fortuna. 
Alejandro taught me more about the coffee growing process in 10 minutes than I&#39;ve learned in my lifetime! 
This place is a privilege to visit and enjoy! I will be coming back again and again with my wife!"

The Latin-inspired breakfast and lunch menu, including stuffed poblanos and quesadillas, compliments the coffee menu.  I ordered a salted caramel iced latte and then saw the menu with all of the hot espresso drinks.  My latte was OK, it was a little bitter.  

They just recently started selling cold press coffee; the owner/manager gave me a sample and it was amazing with the slightest sweetness and crisp flavor.  I had this on my second visit and was again impressed by the cold press - get this, you won&#39;t be sorry.

If coffee isn&#39;t your thing, they also have wine and beer from local breweries like Urban Legend, which I hope to try soon.  The employees are warm and friendly."

I didn&#39;t realize how amazing this place is. They have an enormous selection of coffee, expresso, and more. I was in awe for how unique this place is. They have a really cool setup and vibe and some fancy looking machinery in the back. I had the medium chemex it was really good but a little too strong for my taste. I was assuming that I would get in a regular medium cup like in Starbucks but this was so much better. They basically brought it in a specialty glass coffee maker and I was able to pour it into a cup. It was a lot more than your regular medium cup. I think I had about three servings from it. My friend got the Mexican hot chocolate. She really enjoyed it. I also got one of their pastries and it was to die for. The only thing is they don&#39;t have that man outlets and their tables are kind of small so it&#39;s hard to study."

Try their house coffee or their matcha tea blueberry ! The service is excellent and the food is absolutely delicious. The owner is very personable came over and shared his families history about their plantation in Mexico very interesting and inspiring knowing that this coffee isn&#39;t just bought from a big distributer. Also a very relaxing atmosphere displaying local artists work for sale ! Highly recommended
cafe-la-fortuna-willowbrook,Jaclyn S.,IeRoBHDlWjn58HnK4YtBrA,"Chicago, IL",0,1,1,21,29,mj_IOHYq5fvYB5OxX_JUPg,4.0,2016-03-31,"I came here with a bunch of co-workers due to the positive reviews - let&#39;s just say I loved it, but others did not.

FOOD: I would describe Cafe La Fortuna as having an identity crisis - they appear to be a coffee bar 100% and the coffee is DELICIOUS, but then you venture over to the menu to find regular pastries and what else ... Mexican food, also DELICIOUS. I had a tamale, tacos, and a torta here - all delicious. I would recommend getting 2 orders of tacos ($10/2 orders) as 1 was not enough. Or getting a taco and tamale. The flavors are all their prices are very reasonable. ... Back to the identity crisis they also serve beer and wine - they offer wine tastings, oh and you can get a bubble tea if you fancy. As you can tell, it&#39;s a very confusing place, but I can see why it has positive reviews! They also have a delicious breakfast menu to grab and go!

STAFF: The staff was very friendly and accomodating to our large group of 7 people. You order and pay prior to getting your food - which the staff will bring over to you.

PRICES: Tacos are $5 for 2 tacos, $5 tamale, torta (which is huge) $6, rice and beans $1 - so you can easily mix and match to get a delicious meal for $10-$15. The coffee drinks are large and reasonably priced $3-5. The portions are confusing as some things are large and others small.

AMBIANCE: The atmosphere is also dealing with an identity crisis - it looks like a coffee shop - could be a sole coffee shop. It should look like an edgy cafe. I did enjoy the alternative decor and if you look at the ceiling they have some cool art pieces hanging. The crowd that was there was varied in age and you can easily enjoy a solo meal, a date or a work lunch here.

I will be back, without coworkers in tow! This is a place I can go in the AM or after work and enjoy. It could use some work on it&#39;s &#34;identity&#34; and &#34;atmosphere,&#34; but the food, drinks and selection I enjoyed."

The iced coffee with milk was perfect! I can never find a place that makes it like I like it (not even Starbucks or Peets) but this place did, as if fate brought me here! I also got some chicken tacos. They come with rice and beans and I was expecting one of those huge, lard-filled plates that taste good but then make you super stuffed and nasty. What I got was a perfectly sized plate of two very fresh tacos with a very small portion of black beans and rice with salsa. It was perfect. Just the right size to feel full and satisfied but not disgusting. Everything was fresh. You can tell it wasn&#39;t slopped out from a can. I am from Southern California and like my food light and fresh. This place totally fit the bill for me!!!! Service was perfect too. Seriously, everything was perfect. The only problem is that it&#39;s hard to figure out what they are trying to &#34;be&#34; here -- a coffee shop? A wine bar? A draft beer bar? A Mexican restaurant? Oh well, it doesn&#39;t matter because they do all of it well. GO HERE AND KEEP THEM IN BUSINESS!!!!"

However, my experience was destroyed because the counter person refused me a place to eat because I have a service dog. I asked for a manager. There was none . I asked her to call the owner. She refused. All she kept saying was that she didn&#39;t know anything about service dogs coming into the cafe. She was very unhelpful . I finally got  my order to go. I also insisted on the name and number of the owner. I called him when I left the place and explained what had happened. He was horrified because he knew the law and knew that I should not have been barred from the cafe. If you are a regular person, you will not have any problems there.

I&#39;m not even sure what I&#39;m drinking but it is warm and cinnamon coffee with milk, and paired with the breakfast  sandwich is making me feel like I&#39;m in a faraway place. Not a strip mall in Willowbrook.  I feel bad about the person with the bad review because of the service animal. However it is clear that the owners and employees are immigrants, and not everywhere has laws about service animals. Hopefully it was a good learning experience for the staff because the cafe is great."

The coffee is great but the food, although good, seems to be reheated and not made to order. The tacos or any of their meats always seem a dry and over done.

I got the carnitas tacos, and they were excellent. I&#39;d recommend getting two orders if you&#39;re getting this as your meal. One order is only two tacos. But each order is about $5, so 4 tacos for $10 is still a great price. Two other people I was with both got the chorizo torta breakfast sandwich - also delicious. Of course, we had to try some of the desserts. We got a flan and tres leches cake. The tres leches was unreal. One of the best I&#39;ve had by far. 

The service was very good, too. All of the employees were extremely nice and we were asked if we need anything else a couple of times throughout the evening. 

I&#39;d absolutely recommend this place over a Starbucks if you&#39;re looking for a nice little place to relax with a friend or get some work done. 

The only knock against this place is it seems to have an identity crisis. You can&#39;t really tell if it&#39;s supposed to be a coffee shop or a Mexican restaurant. But at least the food is still great! I can&#39;t wait to go back and try the coffee because I guess that is what they&#39;re known for!"

Cafe La Fortuna has a wonderful vibe -- true character and a sense of place. The owner, Alejandro, not only grows his own wonderful coffee (really, on the family plantation in Chiapas, Mexico) but also serves delicious, traditional Mexican food that&#39;s on the lighter side and always yummy and fresh. He explained to me -- and he takes plenty of time to visit so that I never feel rushed or like he has something more important to do -- that he and his staff came up with the idea of serving items that are similar to what the staff eats in Chiapas during the coffee harvest. The Willowbrook location is spacious and comfortable, with good light, especially after the outdoor renovations. I like the downtown Hinsdale location too -- great if I need to immerse myself in work for an hour in a quiet location with delicious coffee and friendly people."

When you eventually get what you ordered, it makes up for it, but what an ordeal in until then. Don&#39;t come here if you&#39;re in a hurry.

Don&#39;t get me wrong the food was good but the service was not that good. I didn&#39;t catch the girl&#39;s name but could tell right away she had an attitude. I ask her if she can take out the nuts in my salad. She said she can. Since I&#39;m highly allergic to nuts I was just wondering if that was an option for the salad. So seeing and thinking there weren&#39;t any I ate the salad. However I found two almond pieces in the salad and I could of eaten more. I was adamant to tell her. Not asking for a refund or anything in that lines, just want to let her know the mistake. When I did tell her she did a non-audible response and walked away. So in all the friendliness of their service I am not impressed.  Once again I recommend to go eat there and try their food just the service is lacking so just watch out with whom you speak to there. Also clarify why you want to omit in something because they might not understand why."

She also said they have 5 milks to choose from including unsweetened almond, soy and cashew milk. My soy latte was creamy and lightly sweet, as I asked for a little vanilla. You get a total cozy feel here. She greeted locals and Asked one how college was going. You would never get that at Starbucks (which I can&#39;t stand unless it&#39;s a last resort).

She walked me through their menu and gave me some samples of their coffee while explaining the differences between the two.  I decided on their house blend,  which had a good balance and nice sweet /nutty tones.  I sat at the bar area and began to chat with Eric the manager,  who was very receptive of all the questions I had for him.  He had me try our the cold brew coffee,  which is made using a 24 hour drip brew system. Very delicious and holds up well to cream. He also had me try the cafe con Leche, which had a nice,  sweet cinnamon spice to it. I also got an Assam black tea to round out my visit. Overall excellent customer engagement, delicious coffee, and a very nice space to enjoy my time.  I&#39;ll be getting food next time!"

Far as coffee goes, not very good, Luke warm coffee, with a Mexican flare but tasteless both times with two different types if drinks.  Service was very good, doing what they can with what they have sort of feel. The should change the name since The word &#34;Cafe&#34; along with the fact there used to be a caribou coffee there makes you think they have some good coffee choices and selections, yet looks more like a nice bar and menu looks geared more to Mexican specialty restaurant."

It was a pretty warm night so we sat inside but I almost think that it would be the preferred option... the &#34;deck/patio&#34; is just across the street from the train so it can get pretty noisey. Inside was nice, however, and become pretty lively as the night progressed. We sat right up front by the window so I didn&#39;t see too much of the rest of the place, and actually didn&#39;t go to the bathroom (shocking, I know!) at all, but it looked well taken care of and clean.

Upon being seated we were set up with water and bread w/ oil. I cannot stress this enough, the bread + oil is OUTSTANDING! I believe it has shaved olives in it, which I&#39;m not even an olive fan, and it will blow you away. From that jumping off point we also started with the Carciofi Fritti (fried artichoke hearts) and those were delicious as well! For dinner we had an assortment of items: Salomone Almandine (good sized portion and pretty tasty), Melanzane Alla Parmigiana (very good and large enough for left overs), Ravioli Con Asparagi (a pretty small portion, but very enjoyable), Crab &amp; Shrimp Diavolo (large portion and SO GOOD!), and sides of Broccolini and Spinach (spinach was the better choice).

Not only did the menu itself make it hard to choose entrees, but once we tasted everything we knew we&#39;d have to return again in the future. And we will, I know it!"

My conclusion is that you get about 1/2 the food at the same quality for about double the price.  Not a good combination.  

The service was good but I do resent having a 20% service charge added when there are only 5 people.  Our reservation was never for a greater number.  I would have given the waiter 20% because he was good.   However, I don&#39;t like this automatic 20% assumption.  Typically OK for a larger party but not for 5 people.

The food was good but nothing special.  Very similar to other Italian choices in Glen Ellyn and other suburbs.  The portions are very small yet prices are double what the former establishment charged.   I understand this establishment has different owners and it is a different style Italian restaurant but they need to keep in mind that they will be judged versus the original place and other local eateries. 

Its for others to try, but as I shared when I left, there is no reason to go back."

Now, let&#39;s talk about the service. Our server was friendly and pleasant but obviously had no job training. We were seated and presented with an extensive cocktail/wine list. Almost immediately our server asked for our drink order, when we asked for a moment to look over the menu she just hovered over us.  We hurried ourselves and ordered, it took 15 minutes for the cocktails to arrive. The restaurant was half full so I don&#39;t think the bartender was swamped. 

We ordered dinner and decided to split an appetizer, mussels in white wine sauce (very good), when it came, the server just plopped it on the table and left, we had no serving utensils or plates and had to flag the server down to bring them.  

For our main course we both ordered the veal Marsala (also very good) and split a side of pasta, everything is a la carte.  The server brought the side, a very small bowl of pasta and left.  Now don&#39;t assume that this was meant as the traditional pasta course as is done in many Italian restaurants; we had no plates on which to serve the pasta. Ten minutes later the main course arrived, by then the pasta was cold. 

I don&#39;t regret visiting but doubt that I&#39;ll be back, there are many other Italian restaurants nearby which are better."
enza-sicilian-osteria-glen-ellyn,Amy R.,wu-KCcbj-WgYPAuiVSqzZg,"Naperville, IL",1,1,1,179,105,ypbjNXMHBQasgxteGI2zXw,4.0,2016-02-06,"I&#39;m a sucker for a craft cocktail menu, so when my coworker advised me there was a restaurant in Glen Elyn that had a really interesting cocktail selection, I couldn&#39;t wait to try! My husband and I made a late res (9pm) on OpenTable and off we went.

The place is teeny tiny and decorated like the cool girl in college&#39;s freshman dorm: a random assortment of drapes, mirrors, and lots and lots of purple. The tables were classy and simple with white linen and a candle in the center. My husband and I were starving and eagerly ordered the goat cheese appetizer as we decided on drinks. The goat cheese appetizer was great, as was the bread and flavored oil that came as well. I settled on the Gin Blossom, and my husband got the Palermo to Paris. I was SUPER excited, but I hated my drink. My husband&#39;s was awesome - like a fancy mimosa - and I stole several sips of it.

The menu is split into first and second courses, so we foolishly ordered one of each in our wide-eyed anticipation of the menu and insane hunger. For the first course, I got the squid ink linguine, and husband got the ravioli with asparagus. His looked amazing, but I couldn&#39;t try it due to a stupid truffle allergy. My squid ink pasta was AH. MAY. ZING. Amazing. Dark, substantial pasta nestled in a deep oval bowl and surrounded by shrimp, mussels, clams, and squid. Easily the best pasta dish I have EVER had. 

Unfortunately, we were totally full and didn&#39;t need our already ordered second courses. Oops. I got the grass fed NY strip steak with seasonal vegetables. The veg were kinda limp and unnecessary and the onion strings atop the steak were a little soggy but the actual meat was delicious - tender, well cooked, and full of flavor. Husband got the chicken stuffed with prosciutto, sage and fontina and he LOVED it. We each took about two bites and then had it wrapped but still. Delightful.

For dessert, I got the lemon ice - I was too full for anything else - and it, too, was incredible. The most incredible silky texture, a tart but not unreasonable lemon flavor, and a lovely portion. I don&#39;t even usually like lemon and I loved it.

Unwilling to give up on the cocktail menu, my husband got the cider, served hot. He didn&#39;t like that either. Sadly on our next trip, we also tried the smoke and barrel (so unbearably strong my husband sent it back), the Vert Monaco, and the Speakeasy, and they were all just not delicious. While I respect the incredible ingredients and the thought that went into them, the result has to be tasty, too. That part needs work.

So in conclusion, what started as  an outing to enjoy some craft cocktails turned into a new, incredible Italian spot to keep returning to. While my quest for a craft cocktail in the burbs continues, my cravings for incredible pasta end at Enza."

So we decided to try it one evening even though the Yelp reviews were varied in their praise.  I am glad we did, the food was superb.  I would imagine the cocktails are too, but I was driving so I steered clear of anything too volatile.

For dinner I chose the whitefish special and it was certainly one of the better choices on the menu.  My buddy had the risotto, but he was jealous of my whitefish and the guy doesn&#39;t even like fish!  Service was very good, I like people who keep an eye from a distance and make sure everything goes smoothly but don&#39;t hover.  It worked out great.  They let us order two different desserts and then split them for us and plated the two together so we could try both.  Very nicely done.

I recommend this place for a nice dinner, it would work out great for a date with the significant smother.  The place is small and intimate, and the overall experience is quality."

There isn&#39;t much I don&#39;t like but I still want to know what I&#39;m ordering.  My husband&#39;s lamb shank was downright cold and bland.  It was supposed to be accompanied by demi-glace but the watery, greasy sauce did not come close.  This place may survive because there are not many other restaurants here.

The second time we visited we ordered a breaded pork chop dinner that was dried out from being over cooked. Not even close to being moist. Needless to say we were very disappointed the second and last time we were there. 

Very good cocktails but by far some of the most expensive in Glen Ellyn. Food and drinks tend to be more on the expensive side for what you get. $$$

We will give it another shot at some point in hopes of having a similar experience as our first visit.  But for now we are not rushing back"

We were seated promptly upon arrival.  Water and bread served up quickly.  We ordered the Affettati Misti Antipasti.  WOW, really great...says it will serve 2-3, but I&#39;d say more like 4-5.  The meats and cheeses were outstanding and the grilled artichokes were a very nice touch.

The interior is warmer and more put-together than when it was Vittorio&#39;s.  The changes were subtle, but make a nice impact.

Two of us ordered the spinach kale salad almondine and it is a must if you dine here.  Dressed perfectly with a very tasty lemon dressing...the currants really round everything out...a really well-balanced salad, flavor-wise (and again, a very nice portion).  

On to the pastas.  All house-made.  One of us had the Ravioli, one the Orecchiette and another the Pappardelle Bolognese.  All were outstanding.  I personally had the Bolognese, and it was one of the best I have had since I was in Florence.  

Service was spot-on.  Really enjoyed our server Andrea and host Kim.  Owner was very attentive and made sure he checked in with each table.  This is a must-try place and an excellent addition to Glen Ellyn&#39;s growing list of fine restaurants."

The place looks nice. The whole staff was very friendly and accommodating. This is a brand new business and I offer these comments knowing that it takes awhile for a new restaurant to find it&#39;s footing.

The curtain at the front door is still there to help keep the cold air out when anyone opens the door but it&#39;s not totally effective. A new entryway with a second door outside would be better. The two-top tables are a little too big, keeping you just a few inches too far from your date. The complimentary bread is pretty OK. I ate some so it must be decent. The olive oil for dipping is good but we were given a very small portion. I would prefer to have parmesan at the table instead of having the waiter use the silly cheese grinder. 

The menu tries to be a little too creative - cauliflower does not belong in gnocchi and its addition prevented my wife from trying it. She opted for the carbonara instead. This was very odd carbonara, as it was in a red sauce and claimed to include squash, though no squash was seen. We were told the soup was &#34;roasted red pepper with meatballs&#34; but it was actually stuffed pepper soup. I expect roasted red pepper soup to be creamy but this was a regular minestrone-like broth. And the &#34;meatballs&#34; were just small pieces of ground beef, not in ball form at all. I want my balls! Neither of these dishes would be ordered again. 

The orecchiette saved the day. It was fantastic. Order it. 

I&#39;ll definitely try Enza again. The people are very nice, the inside is attractive and the orecchiette is delicious. If they tweak the menu to add some classic Italian dishes and add a few lower cost items (current prices are more city than suburb) they should make it."

The whole meal I had to hear silverware being thrown everywhere and loud rock music. We could not even talk to each other. The whole meal none of the other tables where filled. I expect to be treated like a human being not thrown next to the kitchen in the back. The waiter rushed us for our drink orders. And then hovered when we picked out our meals.

Shrimp promodoro was tasty... If you LOVE a healthy helping of cheese, which I do :) The gnocchi tasted al dente. A nice surprise since most restaurants over cook their pasta. 

The chicken vesuvio could have used a little more wine sauce with its serving and less salt. It seemed our helping might have sat in the oven a little longer than expected, and came out dry. However, A for effort. 

All in all, we had a lovely experience and can&#39;t wait to revisit... Maybe next time on the patio."

I was excited to enjoy a cheat meal of truffle ravioli only to find it not tasting of truffle oil at all and the most bland ravioli I&#39;ve ever had.  My husband ordered the pork chop special which had an apple cinnamon glaze that was so over powering it was hard to choke down.  Our daughter ordered the macaroni and cheese and we had to send it back as it wasn&#39;t palatable when we all tried tasting it.

The décor is odd, in that it&#39;s painted purple with lighting that looks like it belongs in a little girls bedroom and random metal pieces hung on the wall.  Also, micro sized flower vases were hanging on the walls.  The tables are covered with what looks like laminate flooring???

There needs to be something more to prevent the cold air from coming in the door.

It was so obnoxiously loud we could not hear each other have a conversation ..we were celebrating a special occasion but this was not going to happen here. The food was great but you had to eat fast or it would b cold! The decor looks like they went to a flea market..Very pricy for what you didn&#39;t get..will not return.

I have yet to be dissapointed, the food is incredible fresh and there is something on the menu for everyone. The cocktail list is like nothing I have ever experienced before and I have watched people order their drink and are shocked at how good and original they are. Wine selections as well were well thought out.  Staff is attentive and knowledgeable on the menu as well as the cocktails. The hostess even accomidated me very quickly when I did not have a reservation and the place was very full. This will become a staple in downtown Glen Ellyn. I can not wait to visit again."

My 7 o&#39;clock reservation for one was honored immediately and rewarded with a seat at a high top in the bar with a picture window to my right looking out onto the street. The bar to my left. Perfect! Right in my wheelhouse. Two leisurely martinis later I ordered the cream of broccoli soup and the prosciutto wrapped scallops on top of sautéed asparagus on top of seafood tasting (no actual sea food) risotto. The soup was, well, cream of broccoli soup. The scallop entree was an abomination. I ate two of the three scallops and picked at the asparagus and the risotto which was not not creamy or completely cooked. When the kind and friendly waitress asked how the meal was, I had to tell her the bad news. She offered to bring me anything else but I declined and asked for the check. The bus boy cleared the table and I&#39;m sure tossed the considerable remains of the scallop dish in the kitchen garbage, the chef never knowing he had a dissatisfied customer. As long as I&#39;m piling on here, I have to mention the ambience in the bar. Three bare light bulbs hanging over the bar giving the room a pall you&#39;d only find in a dank closet given the walls were painted some dark, unrecognizable shade. I was hoping for so much more considering Enza took the place of a really fine Italian ristorante, &#34;Vitorio&#39;s&#34;.  OK. I&#39;ve vented. I&#39;ve been known to return to places where there was an unpleasant experience. In this case, it will be awhile."

The beef and barley soup is so full of beef, grains, and vegetables that it&#39;s almost a stew.

Small off the beaten path deli with great quality food at a more than reasonable price. I had the $5.99 special-half Italian sub and split pea w/ ham (AND SAUSAGE) soup...This was new to me and I&#39;m so happy I was introduced to this combo... It also had corn and some other tasty variations added in. Unbelievably wonderful take on the ol&#39; split pea and ham. The sandwich was also very very good! I&#39;m a fan of any place that uses actual Mortadella instead of Oscar Meyer Bologna disguised as fresh sand which meat... The capicola as you see in the picture was beautiful and tasty!  

Not overloaded with condiments or ingredients but they do offer a double cut sandwich which may be a wiser choice if you are really hungry... All in all nice quiet friendly place to grab a quick homemade bite to eat while watching Jeopardy on the TV  (much like your grandmas house probably) all at a great price! Nice seating area as well.

P.S. I&#39;m not usually a desert guy but the Apple Tart looked so amazing I had to try it... It delivered on the promise... Apple on the bottom, cream cheese center, fresh strawberries on top all wrapped up by a great puffy pastry dough and sprinkled with just enough powdered sugar."

It was the sauerkraut Casserole. I have never had this before and my wife said order the kids sandwiches because it didn&#39;t look like something they would like. Turns out my wife and I ended up sharing our special with the kids. As always great food, can&#39;t imagine better. 

As for the guy who ordered a hotdog...seriously, you go to a deli and order a hotdog?  Did you go to hot Doug&#39;s and order a corn dog?  Do you go to Kuma&#39;s corner and order Mac and cheese?  Sometimes we need to stop and think, maybe I should order what they are known for. 

Got to go. I&#39;m getting hungry again. I think I&#39;ll hit Portillo&#39;s for a hard boiled egg. (Genius)"

I&#39;ve driven by this deli for years without a thought of stopping in... from the outside it looks like one of those convenience stores that used to be a White Hen Pantry (That&#39;s like a 7-11 with a deli for those folks that haven&#39;t been around long...) and I haven&#39;t had many good experiences with those ex WHP stores.

But, this place isn&#39;t like that. The deli is the feature, not a sideline and they have a dedicated eating area. I stopped in because of the Yelp reviews and I&#39;ve been experiencing some seriously good lunches based on some of those! 

I walked in and was trying to decipher the menu board, but was feeling some pressure because I was the only customer (it was early) and the nice guy behind the counter really wanted to help me... I asked about the chicken chili.. he said &#34;It&#39;s fresh, we just made it&#34; so Ok, I started with a couple of orders of that. While I was trying to figure out what goes on the sandwiches.. he pulled out a tray of half sandwiches that he had just made. So I bought four different ones to try.

I walked out of there with two chicken chili&#39;s, two bags of chips and the four 1/2 sandwiches. Tri-Turkey, Turkey, Italian and Corned Beef. I wasn&#39;t eating it all myself (this time) I was taking some home to share. Lisa and I thought the sandwiches were good. Decent breads, fresh meat but not exactly packed with flavor. This is a preference thing, many of the other reviews like them for this very reason. I like flavor. The corned beef was my favorite of the bunch, but I think that&#39;s because it was the most flavorful. Usually an Italian sub would be my favorite, but this one..not so much.

The chicken chili tasted exactly like beef chili, except with chicken. That&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing, it is what it is.. I&#39;ve had chicken chili done a lot of different ways. The one thing that I didn&#39;t like about it was that the chili was just loaded with kidney beans.. a LOT of them. I&#39;m not a big fan of kidney beans in my chili, but it goes without saying that some people make it that way, and I eat it... this chili just had way too many of them. I ate it anyway, but wouldn&#39;t order that again.

Really nice people there and I wanted to be more excited about the food.. I would try it again..."

Now that I&#39;m no longer in the immediate area, I don&#39;t get to visit as often as I like but I still try to make it a point to stop on occasion.

Like others have said, you can find candy, chips, pop, and the like and pick up a great lunch special at the same time. Yesterday I opted for my favorite, the Italian sub (with everything) with a small chicken gumbo soup. The fresh tasting ingredients combined with the care put into crafting your order makes this place special. You&#39;re not walking into a convenient store and picking up a pre-made sandwich from the cooler. Nope, not here. 

The employees are friendly and will answer any questions you might have. Picking up lunch here feels like grabbin&#39; a quick bite with family. You are not just a customer to them; you are treated like a friend. That alone speaks volumes.

The price for their sandwiches is on par with Subway, Quizno&#39;s, etc... but the difference again is the quality, freshness, and care put into your order. I walked out of DD&amp;P eager to enjoy my lunch, unlike other places where I pick up a sandwich just to get &#34;something in my belly.&#34; I will be back!"

Whether or not this place qualifies as a restaurant  is up in the air in my book. There is some seating on the inside (I recall a decade or so ago this place being larger than it is now) to sit and eat so I&#39;m reviewing it as one.

I decided to stop here to try out the hot dog as on a previous visit I recalled them having a Vienna Beef sign and serving hot dogs. And being the hot dog critic I needed to give this a shot. So I stepped up to the counter and ordered a hot dog special with chips and a drink. The first thing I noticed was that my hot dog was being microwaved, this wasn&#39;t a good sign. 

When ordering hot dogs I generally order it with everything, if questioned I always say &#34;whatever you normally put on it&#34;. For the first time at a Chicago area restaurant I received a hot dog with ketchup following this method of ordering. The hot dog I received came on a soft regular non-poppy seed bun. There was a thin pickle on the hot dog but the condiments were overloaded, there was too much mustard, relish, and ketchup on this hot dog to taste anything else. The hot dog itself was skinless and despite the Vienna beef signage did not possess the color on the outside, color on the inside, or taste of a Vienna Beef hot dog. This was a lousy hot dog. How bad was this, well of the 100+ Hot Dogs I&#39;ve reviewed this is probably the single worst overall. This is a clear one star review."

As a little pantry, it&#39;s exactly what you would expect.  Candy bars, soda and bottled drinks, some food stuff, and so on.  Not exactly as stocked as a 7-11 but priced comparably.  But you aren&#39;t here to pick up a twix.  You&#39;re here because the sign outside says Lunch Special $5.

What sets this pantry apart from your every day convience store is that it&#39;s also a deli.  What sets it apart from other delis is, not only that it&#39;s really good, but also the scratch made soups.  

First time around, I stood around awkwardly looking at the menu trying to find out how everything works.  Sign outside says 5$ lunch but I couldn&#39;t exactly find out how that works, but that&#39;s because I was dumb.  Ended up ordering a Italian Sandwich, and grabbed a diet coke, ended up being around 7 bucks.  Which is close to 5, but not quite.  Turns out that the special is a 1/2 Sandwich and a cup of soup for 5 bucks, which while it is a deal, when you factor in the fact you have to buy a drink will more realistically bump that up to the 7 dollar range, which puts this on par price wise with your run of the mill fast food chains. 

So I sit down at a table, and take a bite.  Now most of the time when you eat an Italian sandwich, it&#39;s super oily and there&#39;s a lot sauce going on to give the sandwich flavor.  Not here.  The dressing was this super light Italian vinagrette that you could barely notice, but what you could notice was the flavor of all the meats, and how awesome the bread is.  It wasn&#39;t oily, it wasn&#39;t heavy, it was just a good sandwich with good meat, on good bread, with a super light (and good) dressing to sauce it up.  I was amazed.

From the handful of sandwiches I&#39;ve had here, I can say that they achieve sandwich perfection.  Which is crazy to think, because this is the last place on earth to expect perfection from.  You take a bite and the flavors are just perfectly balanced.  The bread is fluffy and delicious, then you taste all the meaty goodness, and the cheese, and the fresh veggies, and the condiments.  All the flavors just balance each other so well and nothing is overpowering.  The sandwich is perfect.  

But what amazed me more than that was how friendly everyone was.  Rewind the clock back to when I had no idea what was going on, I was asked by the woman in charge of the register if I had any questions.  When I explained that I had never been before, she welcomed me, which was super awesome.  And after I ordered, she asked &#39;No soup today?&#39; at which point the other woman came by with a sample of the Cream of Potato with Bacon, which I passed on.  However the sampling worked, because I came back today to get a nice big cup of it.

Other weeks I&#39;ve had small conversations with them while I&#39;m eating and they come to clean the tables.  Nothing invasive, just casual conversation.

I like the atmosphere.  I like that the pantry is run by three people who seem like people and not robots taking your order.  I like that they care about their food, and are proud of it.  Proud of how good it is, that they know if they give you a sample, you&#39;ll be back.  That&#39;s not something you see in very many places, yet alone a little deli in the middle of nowhere.  It&#39;s a great little place, and I&#39;ll probably be there every Tuesday for lunch."

I&#39;m not certain if China Ying was severely understaffed this past Thursday, or if their online ordering host Eat24 never sent our order through. However, my first time attempting to order online, rather than in person or over the phone, will be my last. Eighty minutes later and no food, no explanation, and no apology from the frantic clerk who answered the phone. His response was a hasty, &#34;Do you want to cancel the order?&#34; I&#39;m guessing, from his eagerness to have our order disappear that BOTH Eat24 and being understaffed were ruining his evening?

Though I did opt to cancel the order and receive a refund, I still stand by my earlier praise of their food! I just will never order through their website again.

I find that with the many cute, little Chinese carry-out shops we have in the neighborhood, I&#39;ve developed a taste for certain favorite dishes from each place. From China Ying, I absolutely recommend the sesame chicken (best I&#39;ve ever had!) and kung-pow chicken. Both are top-notch on flavor and presentation. Great quality meat, too!

Asked for &#34;no mushrooms, peas, or sprouts&#34; in the lo mein, and the dish tasted so heavily of mushrooms that I couldn&#39;t stomach it - absolutely disgusting. The beef had a strange, melty/spongy texture. There were virtually no vegetables at all, just some carrot strings. Very generous portion... too bad I won&#39;t eat it.

Sweet and sour chicken is usually impossible to mess up - it&#39;s my &#34;safe bet&#34; order, and my kid likes it, obviously, because it&#39;s basically just chicken nuggets. These were incredibly dry, and instead of being crispy, they were just hard. I took a test bite out of one and it was just a little niblet of chicken... I shook another piece and you could hear the chicken bit rattling around inside.

When the show ended, the food was not here. So first, my wife called them, the phone operator, Mr. Jack, replied &#34;Driver is out! Driver is out!&#34; So my wife hang up waited another 10 minutes.

After 70 minutes passed, this time i called. Same Mr. Jack answered &#34;we are making your order now!&#34;. So I asked &#34;what do you mean &#34;making now? We ordered 70 minutes ago, and you said driver was out 10 minutes ago.&#34; He kept saying &#34;we are making now, OK?&#34;

I did not think that&#39;s &#34;okay&#34;. So i asked a simple explanation. &#34;Where was your driver 10 minutes ago?&#34; Mr. Jack said &#34;please hold&#34;. Then I heard him talking with other customer for a few minutes. After it became quiet, he did not come back on the phone for 20 minutes. During that time, i heard several phone calls were ringing through my phone and they were never answered by anyone.

After 90 minutes since we ordered, he came back to phone and said &#34;how can I help you?&#34; with great business voice. I said &#34;yes, please answer my question&#34;. He said &#34;what??&#34;and froze for a while, and said &#34;we are making your food right now, okay?&#34;.

This time i asked to speak with manager. He said &#34;Mr. Ying is not here&#34;. So I asked for cancellation of the order. He said &#34;can I help you with something else?&#34; So I said &#34;Yes, please explain where your driver was before, and why could you let us know you could not make it?&#34;

His answer was &#34;We were very busy right now. If you came to pick up instead of delibery, you could get your food much faster. I cannot talk with you right now.&#34; And he hang up. 


My questions:
 1. 
 How could we decide to order for pick up without knowing delivery would take more than 90 minutes? 

2. 
 After 90 minutes, food were not ready. How could we &#34;pick up your food  much faster&#34;?

3. 
 What was Mr. Jack doing for 20 minutes while i was holding phone? And why nobody picked up several incoming calls I heard during waiting?

4. 
 Without explaining a simple question, how can Mr. Jack work as customer service? 

5. 
 Does Manager Ying know about the situation? Did Mr. Jack report about this &#34;crazy customer&#34; to Mr. Ying?

I did not get any answer from Mr. Jack or manager Ying. After 24 hours, i am still angry, so i decided to write about my experience here."

Everything was yummy, no questionable pieces of meat and good flavoring.  The only reason I did not give 5 stars was because we were $1 away from using our &#34;free one piece rangoon w/ a $20 order&#34;, yet they would not let us use the coupon"

I will continue to publish my thoughts here until the owner decides to talk to me directly about how he treated our softball team. I was a patron of this establishment for years until the owner decided to one day not pay us for a season after we had been frequented his bar multiple times a week. 

How bringing this up is a breach of guidelines is beyond me. Sponsoring softball teams is a standard practice in the west suburban area and teams looking for sponsorship opportunities might be better served looking for a sponsor who will actually stand behind their word.

Walsh&#39;s is a tiny cozy bar with video gaming which appears to be standard in most suburban bars. The crowd is friendly and older with a fair amount of regulars. Prices were fairly reasonable with limit tap beer selection. Walsh&#39;s does not have any appetizers due to there not being a deep fryer (which may be a first) so we went for the white chicken chili. Delicious. Unfortunately, we didn&#39;t order one of their notable pockets and went for their pizza. I&#39;m not sure if they even have an oven back there, but it was nothing more than a microwave pizza.

I think my original review went a little something like this: &#34;I&#39;m drunk. And I just came from Walsh&#39;s. It was pretty awesome.&#34;

Went here on a whim one night when all the bars in Downtown Downers were packed for the &#39;hawks game. Heard it was kind of divy which was the appeal at the moment but it was actually surprisingly clean and nice inside!

Our waitress was really pleasant and made sure our drinks kept coming but yet made sure it was okay to keep bringing me drinks past number 5 (seriously....how many did I drink!?). I thought that was pretty nice of her. There&#39;s not much there but I think it goes along with the company you keep- we had a fun evening just catching up with friends, playing music on the jukebox (until this idiot put $20 in and played METALLICA non-stop...UGH).

The only downside is when surveying the menu it didn&#39;t look like much I could eat as a vegetarian with food allergies or much I&#39;d want to eat anyway. They didn&#39;t have any french fries- isn&#39;t that the quintessential drunk carb binge food??"

So much that we are never planning on going back there again. 

We ordered 3 or 4 combo plates (3 tacos, rice &amp; beans) for take out. One chicken, one chorizo and one pork. The chicken was for someone who simply cannot eat red meat, hence only poultry. When we opened our dinner boxes at home, none of the orders had chicken tacos. All of them were either chorizo or pork ! 

I was told that the pork tacos tasted extremely dry and like some &#34;mystery meat&#34;. The person who ate them was frustrated at the way they had been prepared and tasted. As for the person who was looking forward to eating the chicken tacos, they had to forego thinking about it and eat a TV dinner.

Tacos were pretty good, no surprise there with the chicken being the slight fav out of the 3.  Who would of thought that the horchata would turn out to be standout item, never had one that was so flavorful.  Burrito wasn&#39;t bad by all means, just didn&#39;t have as much flavor as anticipated."

We ordered 4 chicken tacos to share, and a side of beans and rice and a Mandarin Jarrito all for $8.80.

Usually I go through at least one basket while I wait for my food at other restaurants.  I was happy with my food and the price was very responsible.  I will definitely go back!"

Apparently they&#39;ve only had low quality food. This place was pathetic! Food was dry and had no taste what so ever. Waitress for one order wrong and forgot another out of 4 orders. Food made our stomach hurt after we left. I was embarrassed with my friends because they rely on me for good quality dining places. This place should be out of business. I believe all the great reviews were probably written by their own friends and family to lure in innocent patrons.

The set up is unusual; the menu is posted along the wall like a fast food joint, but if you actually sit down and take a table you will be waited on as with a traditional restaurant - albeit you still have to look up/over at the wall to order. That said, the only staff members who *seemed* to understand English well were the teenage employees; our waitress had trouble understanding simple requests in English, respectively. (My friend and I were the only Gringas in the joint). 

Now, for the food...que rico. 

Although you have to pay for chips and salsa, they do bring out a bowl of lime slices for free, and nothing is over $7 - cuz for $7, you get the whole platter&#39;d sha-bang (minus chips and salsa): burrito, taco, tostada, beans and rice. You will be bringing fully 1/2 of it home, happily. Although larger than what you get on a platter, I really don&#39;t see the point in buying an individual burrito; it&#39;s only $2 cheaper. (Might as well go for variety, eh?)

Moving along, you get to select a meat for each item (if you want carne)...I chose chicken for everything and it was super juicy and well marinated, covered in some sort of thin red sauce that wasn&#39;t hot sauce - but milder and much, much tastier (and I like traditional hot sauce). They also put plenty of veggies, avocado slices, sour cream, and cheese on - and in - everything. 

Some of the best Mex I&#39;ve ever had...with tax, drink, chips, and a whole box of leftovers = barely over $10 bucks. A lot of people were coming in and out for take-out."

They take a soft corn tortilla, stuff it with stewed chicken, then deep fry it until the tortilla is crisp.  Then they stuff it with lettuce, tomato, and cheese.  It arrives piping hot and then I pour on the red sauce.  Amazing. There is something about the grease that keeps me coming back, seriously!    

They also have very good tamales- meaty, with a nice amount of masa but not overly thick.  Very good flavor and also served piping hot.

Note, a little bit of Spanish goes a long way here.  The service is quick, friendly, and two people can eat well for very cheap.

I&#39;ve now eaten here over 20 times since they opened and there has been no loss of quality, customer service, or cleanliness in that time.  TBJ has been consistently very good.

But what really leads me to increase the review is their new fried chicken sandwich.  It is very large, fresh fried to order, and the breading is light and about as tasty as it gets.  I think it&#39;s the best tasting fried chicken sandwich in the area, even better than places like Dell Rhea&#39;s Chicken Basket in Willowbrook of Diners Drive-Ins &amp; Dives fame.

Eric S: &#34;so where are we going for dinner?&#34;
Jackie S: &#34;That Burger Joint&#34;
E: &#34;which burger joint??&#34;
J: &#34;I just told you&#34;
E: &#34;no, &#39;where&#39; is what I&#39;m asking&#34;
J: &#34;exactly&#34;
E: &#34;DAMMIT JACKIE I&#39;M HUNGRY&#34;
J: &#34;just drive to: that burger joint&#34;
E: (practically fuming)

After we got those shenanigans out of the way, I arrived ravenous and ready to devour one of their build-your-own burgers.  Much like Five Guys, all the toppings are free, but unlike 5G, at TBJ you get to choose your own bun (standard or pretzel).  You can get a single or double patty for $6 or $7, which is kinda expensive, if I&#39;m being honest.  I added fresh jalapenos with BBQ and lettuce + tomato to my single with cheese, although next time I&#39;ll go with a double.  Their petal sauce is a combination of ketchup, mayo, and horseradish, a zippy concoction that tastes great on a burger.

The dining area is small and no-frills.  Pop machine is hilariously outdated (hey you guys, 1996 called and wants its soda fountain back pronto!)

BUT.

Thanks to the attached Oberweis (literally shares an open area with That Burger Joint), there&#39;s a milk dispenser.  With 2% and chocolate milk.  Unlimited Oberweis chocolate milk, for $2?  Are you kidding me?!?  This alone makes coming here worth it.  Excellent fries, too.  Nice and greasy, just the way I like &#39;em.  Add to that seasoning shakers and you&#39;ve got a darn tasty meal at your fingertips.  Friendly employees, to boot.

Bread = 5
Circuses = 3

Next time I&#39;m in the area and seeking a quick bite, This Burger Joint (I mean &#39;That&#39; Burger Joint) will absolutely be on my radar."

I like the simplified menu with just four items: Burger, Jr. Burger, Chicken or Hot Dog. Each comes with choice of several free toppings. Cheese and bacon are an extra charge. I recommend the pretzel bun for the cheeseburger. 

The dining area is split between Oberweis and TBJ, with TBJ having only 8 tables. 

The cashier, Kristine, is very friendly and cheerful. She took our order correctly, but unfortunately the cook did not make one of our burgers correctly (per the ticket/receipt).

While service is quick (less than 10 minutes to receive meal), beware... 2 cheeseburgers, 2 sodas, 1 fry will set you back $25."

My first, and only, visit was a week ago. 

Nutshell: Bland,unseasoned burgers. McDonald&#39;s seasons their burgers with salt and pepper. C&#39;mon.

The only cheese they offered during my visit was American cheese. Uh, to be called &#39;That Burger Joint&#39;, I&#39;m thinking this is the end all place. I&#39;m thinking CHOICES, right? Cheddar, Bleu, Pepperjack, Swiss, Monterey Jack, Smoked Gouda....and American for the kids.
So, I wasn&#39;t going to have a plain burger so I reluctantly got American.

The double patties on my burger were thicker than a McDonald&#39;s cheeseburger but thinner than the Quarter Pounder. The pretzel bun,and the fact there isn&#39;t an upcharge for it, was the only saving grace.

Perhaps I&#39;m just biased because of the burgers I&#39;ve had in the city. That Burger Joint just didn&#39;t leave me wanting more."

Interesting concept as they share space in building w/  Oberweis dairy. Going thru the door, one side is Oberweis and the main area is That burger joint. If you want a shake with your meal you can order right there off the menu in the burger side. Dining area wasnt overly large but has some seating. 
Food is served similar to Culvers  in the fact that you order at the counter then go get seated w/ a number &amp; they bring ur food to u by way of number. Eyeing the order board choices are few, sometimes simplicity is better. You can order a pretzle bun at no up charge as opposed to your regular bun. You want condiments? Those are all free too! Grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, pickles, raw onions, etc no extra charge. I do like that the price of soda is $2 and its one size. Fries come in several sizes and were particularly tasty, the burgers were cooked nicely (a double w/ cheese is $8
Singles are $7.) and were excellent. They had better be at that price. Food is served in stainless steel metal serving trays. Fancy schmancy!! Lol! Service was good &amp; they came around asking if you needed anything and looking to clean ur table before you&#39;ve finished eating. Probably $10-12 for a decent meal.
All in all I&#39;d return. I did not have Oberweis but it would be a satisfying end to a meal.

The restaurant is an ice cream parlor on one side and a hamburger joint on the other. It actually works out pretty well. Patrons can sit wherever they like. All three times that I went there was a good number of people, but plenty of places to sit. Parking is no problem at this location. either. The staff seemed genuinely interested in making sure I was enjoying my meal each time

The burgers are fresh and fairly tasty. You can have them made any way you like with any kind of condiments and/or toppings that you like. The fries were good and crispy and plentiful.

You can order a typical soft drink but since it is part of Oberweis, you can also help yourself to milk or chocolate milk, which was pretty refreshing.

Sure, it is just a hamburger place, but it is a good one. My only complaint was that lunch was a little pricey, but I suppose that is to be expected with high quality ingredients. I never had dessert, but probably should have."

Limited menu is ok with me as it is the new rage. Service was good. Food was ok. I didn&#39;t think the burgers were seasoned at all and that would have made it better for me. There are some choices for seasoning, but they are too spicy or odd for my liking. Just a plain ol&#39; salt and pepper maybe for us normal folks!! Our fries were not fresh unfortunately.

All the stainless steel is greasy and the glass window around the grill looks like it hasn&#39;t been cleaned in months. Floors in the kitchen were a mess. Tables never seem to be clean either. This is not dirt that just happened that day.  It is the same but worse from my last several visits.

We walked in and sat down with 2 kiddos and I immediately wiped down the table since there were a few pieces of food leftover from the previous customer (and I&#39;m a germaphobe). But within a minute, an employee came over with a clean cloth and wiped down the table for us and apologized that we sat down faster than he could clean the table- the place was busy so I believed him. No one had ever wiped our table for us here before so I definitely appreciated it.

The same employee, Cory, brought over two balloons for the kids after asking for permission. My kids loved them! We&#39;ve received balloons here before but never this early in our meal- usually after our meal is done and my kids are pouting over how other kids have balloons and we don&#39;t. Cory, the kind employee, also brought out two coloring pages and s bucket of crayons! It seems so silly and so easy but we&#39;ve never been brought crayons and coloring pages here before. My kids were over the moon! And it gave mommy and daddy some relaxation time while our meal was being made. Awesome service!

When we had ordered, the employee, James, was SUPER courteous. I&#39;ve never had such a great experience ordering food. Again, it sounds so ridiculous. But usually the employees are slow to process your order, try to repeat it and make a mistake and are weary with which buttons to press. James had it down to a science and was just so kind. Very refreshing!

My husband and I just kept saying how much more awesome this place is. The music was even louder to where you can hear it- even in a crowded restaurant- but not too loud. They have a fun music player when you walk in where you can pick the music to play- for free! But we never really messed with it because the music was always too low to even hear. Yesterday, I could finally identify which song was playing and even follow along.

And, of course, the food. The food is ALWAYS great here. I don&#39;t know how they do it since it&#39;s just burgers or hot dogs- very simple menu- but it&#39;s sooo good! My husband gets the double burger on a pretzel bun and I do the single patty cheeseburger on a regular bun. Both are delicious! My kids like the hotdogs. And for parents of little kids- they actually slice the hot dog length-wise so it&#39;s easier to feed little ones!  You can pick from so many toppings and get such a customized burger. Delicious! I highly recommend!!! 

Last night we had to talk to the store manager and thank him for such an improved experience. We told him how great Cory and James were. Oh, also! My son let his green balloon go and it flew up to the ceiling- of course as balloons do. He fussed for a bit but we were eating and I didn&#39;t think it was necessary to ask for another. Not before long, Cory came by with another green balloon without us even asking. How great is that!? The employees really like their job and it totally shows. Expect great service AND great food here!"

Went into &#34;That Burger Joint&#34; this past Sunday since we were in the area and looking to try something we haven&#39;t had before. Although this supposedly is a chain, neither myself or my girlfriend were familiar with it.

Anyways, we were greeted by the staff and ordered promptly - this is where the problems began. A little background - we were the ONLY people in line ordering at the time so when we ordered, the cook put our burgers on the grill. We were impressed (but mistaken) at the speed of how everything was moving. After paying we sat down and waited for our food... and waited... and waited. 

As we watched scores of people (legitimately no less than 15 people) order and get their food before us, I approached the counter about 10-15 minutes later asking where our food was. &#34;We gave your burgers away so we are making you new ones right now.&#34; So they gave our burgers away and decided to serve 15 other people before us - not the best business model in my opinion.

Eventually they tried rectifying the issue by giving us free fries and coupons for free food. Unfortunately, first impressions are lasting and we will not be returning."

After shopping one day I decided to stop in and check it out for lunch.  The restaurant was clean.  The menu is a la carte which can usually add the bill up quickly, but the price point was average.  The burger was very juicy and good size.  The small fry is plenty to share.  I like the seasonings that are available for adding to the fries.  With the restaurant being combined with Oberweiss there is nothing to do, but order a shake with the meal.  Overall the food and experience was good and I will return for another burger."

A flat burger (not a thick/juicy pub style one) that was previously frozen, comes on a bun (or a pretzel bun) and you pick from a dozen or so toppings. 

And they have fries. Meh. Just fries...nothing great. 

Wayyyy overpriced, in my opinion.  Two junior burgers and a large fry and 1 fountain drink....$20. I could have stopped at the grocery store and griped my own burger for less, and it would have tasted better too.  Not worth that price one single bit.  

Can&#39;t say we&#39;ll be back any time soon.  This is only one small step up from McDonalds or Burger King... In the 5 Guys or Meatheads category...but still costs more than them."

That&#39;s not hard to pull off considering 5 guys is mediocre at best regardless of the sheep army it has created like the other people that have reviewed this TBJ such as the girl who drenches her burger in ketchup and uses fries as a utensil to just shove more ketchup in her mouth and the guy who thinks five guys was the first to put fries in a cup.  Quick tip: if you&#39;re a ketchup user then don&#39;t bother yelping. You don&#39;t taste food, you only consume it.


But onto TBJ. The patty was juicy ( first difference i noticed from the sawdust five guys uses ) and tasted like meat; just how a burger should taste. The buns aren&#39;t bad and keep together. Their petal sauce is fairly tasty as well. The fries are crispy while remaining soft on the inside and containing just the right amount of salt. Similar to 5 guys, the fries stand out alive the burger,  but thankfully i didn&#39;t feel like i was stolen from after paying for either even if it is a tad expensive for a burger (6.50 for a double). 

All in all not a bad burger and fries if just a tad expensive but noticeably better than the in-n-out wanna be known as five guys midwesterners seem to so pathetically latch onto. I&#39;d check it out."

I like the fact that their beef and chicken is like what we would buy at a high end grocery store for our family to eat. 

TBJ is way above Five Guys. People compare this place to Five Guys which is like comparing Whole Foods to Aldi. Yes both have groceries and some aspects might taste good but the wholesomeness we want today is only proceed at one. 

Family of 6 really enjoyed our meal here. Kids had hot dogs and milk with an ice cream chaser from Oberweis. They seem to have their act together and had great service. 

In addition kids loved the photo booth on the wall by the front door. Nice little extra touch.  

Big parties need to pull some tables together which isn&#39;t super convenient.

smashburgers, or culvers. as a matter of fact when i saw them on the flattop they looked just like  Culvers.
I guess they are not allowed to season the meat for some reason. mine had no salt, nothing was on the meat to season it.
What really got me were the fries, if you want to call them that. Should be called the &#34;BURNS&#34;.  
As soon as i opened the bag, you could smell the burnt oil that they cooked these things in.  
Smelled and looked burnt.  i handed the cup back to the girl behind the pickup, i told her i didn&#39;t want these,  
they were burned. She hands them right back to me and says they are not burned. I guess its her place to tell a customer if your food is burned or not. Then the guy  
cooking burgers said we can make you more fries but they will be the same way (burnt). they blanch  
the fries first and can let them sit for up to two hours before they fry them (that came from the  manager). I said just give me my money back for the fries. no, he still had to argue that the dark   brown shriveled up things were OK and not burned. i had some that fell out of the cup (good thing)  
so i took pics of them. You should always worry about a company that doesn&#39;t use a phone number for  customer service, just a comment card and you have to provide the stamp.
 the other burger places  have nothing to fear from this place, that&#39;s for sure. am wondering why all the &#34;five star&#34; reviews of this place that can&#39;t even do fries right?"

Let&#39;s just say, I&#39;ve been back 4 times since then, and that Friday night was only a few weeks ago. :-)

The burgers are high quality and are wonderfully flavored.  The bun is also very good, and you have a wide selection of toppings.  The price is just right.

Some have compared That Burger Joint to Five Guys, and my personal opinion is that it (TBJ) is WAY better.  The burger is bigger, the meat a better quality, you can choose a pretzel roll, the French fries taste better, and . . . I Never crave Five Guys. Hehehe

Our waiter was so nice and friendly, full of smiles. I wish I could remember his name, maybe Jake. He deserves more kudos! Anyhow, we started with fried pickles which I&#39;m pretty picky about and these were awesome! Definitely a must get.

We decided to get wings since that&#39;s what they were about. You can get different flavors in increments of 5, so we got four different flavors. All wings were boneless, and you can also add heat. Garlic Parmesan- probably the best I&#39;ve ever had. Garlic-Q was recommended by our waiter and was a nice switch from bbq. Peach habenero- surprisingly not that spicy, it was a perfect balance of sweet and heat. Sweet chili- this one was my favorite but definitely had a kick! All the wings were a great size and not all breading like their competitors. 

My favorite part: wings came in actual dishes and not little paper trays, plus they were well covered in sauce.

We sat on the dining side.  It was crowded, but not packed full.  Then again, it was dinner time.

Our service was average - we were waiting a little longer than usual but it wasn&#39;t  a horrible wait.  I couldn&#39;t tell if it was because it was busy, under staffed, or both.  

As for the food we got a queso appetizer - we had to ask for extra chips to finish it up, that was no problem. My sister got regular wings, I got boneless...both were great.  Their blue cheese dressing is very tasty!  We finished dinner off splitting a turtle lava cake.  Yum-O!!!

Upon arrival, we were seated, and it took the waitress 10 minutes to bring us our beers. Did I mention our table was less than 10 feet from the bar? I should have just walked over myself and ordered it. Feeling irritated, we decided to settle on an order of the Buffalo Chicken Nachos, which were pretty good. We ate as much of those as we could, chugged our beers, and asked for the check. Surprisingly, the check came faster that our drinks did. We paid, left, and haven&#39;t looked back.

Not a place to write home about."

The wings are the best restaurant wings I have had. Also some fantastic sides. Service is hit or miss. I dont want to say the bartenders suck, but I just did. If management could get a better staff, you wouldn&#39;t have to wait 10-15 minutes with an empty glass at the bar. Restaurant could use more wait staff. 4 stars could go to 5 if there was better service."

On my lunch trip last week, I changed it up and ordered the buffalo chicken &amp; burger without ranch because, yuck, with the bleu cheese dip instead. My order arrives and my parmesan aioli fries are correct (and delicious) but the waitress has brought me the buffalo chicken wrap. It&#39;s a mistake, I get it. I come from the school of writing down orders on a pad to ensure accuracy but that&#39;s neither here nor there.

A few minutes after I finish my fries, my new sandwich arrives with ranch dripping all over it. I did get a side of the bleu cheese dip but I wanted that on the sandwich not this grossness. Instead of waiting around for another new sandwich, I remove all other toppings (all 1 piece of lettuce and tomato) to mitigate the damage. I just pile as much of the dip on as I can and tough my way through.

If that were the end, that would be enough but I order a dessert to go like any glutton for punishment. I order the SEVEN DOLLAR FUNNEL STIX. I do this because they are supposed to come with fresh strawberries and a side of creme anglaise and sea salt caramel dipping sauce. That sounds awesome, right? I note that the bag I get is rather small and light but I just assume that&#39;s portion size and that fried dough sticks aren&#39;t exactly heavy.

When I get home and open the bag, I see no berries nor dipping sauce. In other words, no reason as to why I ordered this in the first place. What was in there was some barely sweet sticks of fried play-doh. I remember eating it as a kid, ok, so I know what it tastes like. This was that without the fun colors.

Had I known this was all that I was getting, I would have saved money and bought actual play-doh. At least I could play with that. It might be boring after five minutes but I wouldn&#39;t have tried to eat it. The only reason this isn&#39;t a one star are for their sauces (bleu cheese and parmesan aioli but not ranch because that isn&#39;t my thing). Everything else was mediocre at best. Again, my dessert should have had what sounded like a delectable sauce as well but no one believed me to be worthy even though I gave them multiple chances and spent $25 dollars for a blah lunch (no alcohol, either). You should bend over backwards for someone like that. Instead, I was an afterthought."

We always get boneless wings and have gotten onion rings, fries and mozzarella sticks as well. The wings are just so good! Very meaty, like no denying that&#39;s good chicken in there! You can pick your levels of spiciness which works out great when you have more than one person in the group who can&#39;t handle things too spicy (me) and also choose the wetness of the wings which just means more sauce which I highly recommend. 

The sides were all good. Loved the mozzarella sticks, they had lots of cheese. Probably could have used a little more flavor though.

We&#39;ve never dined in but the customer service at the front has always been great. I even talked to a manager the last time we went about a coupon issue and he was super cool and nice about handling it.

The only thing I&#39;d recommend is going over the food before the customer leaves. We&#39;ve always had one mistake with our order. One time they messed up the sauce, this past time we didn&#39;t get any blue cheese dip and the first time we were missing like 5 wings so I had to wait for them to cook it (checked the bag in the car that time).

Otherwise I like this place! We will be back, great food and sauces, hopefully they can add more flavors to the menu!"

The boneless wings are huge and not overly breaded like Buffalo Wild Wings. The quality of their wings are great and the Q-BBQ, Bourbon, Sweet Chili and Parmesan garlic sauces were really good. We got the wings both times and have been satisfied. We got the gyro quesadilla and I thought it was ok. There were too many onions in there and the sauce and gyro meat were blain. I wouldn&#39;t get it again. Overall this place is pretty good and a better option than BWW. Also make sure you use the Yelp check in for 5 free wings if you spend $20 or more."

Why cant silverware be on the table when you sit down. Is that too difficult for workers to do? Food came out but there was nothing to eat it with it. And no I cant eat a salad with my hands.

The wings are alright, just nothing special.  Maybe because I went on 69 cent wing night.  

Thier &#34;famous onion rings&#34; are pretty basic onion rings in my book.  And, the serving size for almost $4 leaves a lot to be desired.

The atmosphere and ambience here is a big fail in my book... sticky tables, sticky menus.  The acoustics are weird where voices just seem to hover in the air.  It even fails at being a bar environment because it&#39;s very bright.

The service was good though, and the owner/manager talked with us and seemed really nice.

But the food was pricey for being average on a good day.  I probably won&#39;t be back."

The wings here are MUCH larger,  there are WAY more sauces and you can get any flavor sauce with different heats,  unlike wild wings.   They also give you more sauce,  wild wings have dry spots on theirs.   Other menu items are bigger and better than wild wings too.  
Wild wings blasts rap music so you can&#39;t hear yourself think,  none of that nonsense here. 

Only problem is I went there during a very popular UFC fight, and they did not have it.   We got our wings to go but I was a little disappointed"

We had a great night. A lot of the fun and enjoyment came from our customer experience. For those short readers I recommend this location as a fun place to get great wings in a wide variety and unlike some competition you can modify the heat or enjoy the flavor. They have a wide selection of beers both craft and traditional. The staff is welcoming and fun. 

So let me walk you through keeping in mind sports bars are rated on a much different measure than a luxury restaurant or a regional focused restaurant. 

You know that my bench mark for any restaurant is based off of Food and Service. Sports Bar&#39;s also require quality high availability HD TV programing and Will be measured on beer selection as well as bar skills. Lets face it a proper poor is just as important as the availability of said craft.


Food - They have a wide selection of flavor choices based on your pallet. My crew ordered 50 split into 5 variations three were bone out all white meat fresh chicken tenders and two were traditional bone in. Additionally we ordered the Pulled Pork Nachos.

- The chicken was fresh and the product came out hot and fresh. The meat was juicy and tasted great with a crispy breading on the tenders that held the sauce. The bone in had lots of meat for a wing and were cooked perfectly ( Not dry or scorched) My favorite were the Peach Habanero and the Sweet Tia Chili. 
-The  Pulled Pork Nacho were somewhat less traditional but very much like some that I recently blogged about from a joint in Nashville. I really liked them. Lots of flavor and the slaw was fresh and was maid to perfection. I am a big guy so my crew had a bit of a rough time getting their portion and I was accused of wanting to lick the plate clean. ENOUGH SAID!

Service - From the time we entered the establishment to the time we left we had attention. The greeting was warm at the door and the table. We instantly built a relationship with our server &#34;Britney&#34; and she went out of her way to make sure we had what we needed. From wet naps to brew. She brought us samplings of hotter sauces as well and explained the menu. Food and beverages were delivered promptly and the location was clean. The Manager Dave stopped at each of the tables checking to see if folks were satisfied and seemed like he knew and cared about folks and the staff. 

HD TV&#39;s are everywhere and they were focused on Chicago sports. I believe all events were covered and from what I could tell were viewable from all areas of the restaurant. The audio was loud and clear but not so loud that you couldn&#39;t have a conversation among friends. 

Beer and Beverage - Ok so they seemed to have a fair mix of crafts. I am a port/stout kind of guy and Britney offered me a great stout that I hadn&#39;t heard of and followed on to see if I enjoyed. It was great I always order at least one Guinness a because I love it and because it is the mark of a good poor. The beers all came cold and tasted fresh with no tap filth or line taste. The glasses were clean and the cascade was perfect. My crew also enjoyed there drinks. I noticed a well rounded well drinks behind the bar as well as mid to top shelf beverages. Nothing crazy keeping in mind this isn&#39;t a whiskey bar it is a sports bar all expectations are met.

To sum it up we will return and I look forward to it. I never give 5 stars on the first visit but I am sure if quality is maintained I will improve from 4 to 5 with in the next three to four visits."

We&#39;ve passed it several times and I think it made him curious.  From the outside, the place just looks cheap, to me.  I was surprised when I walked it.  Looks a lot better on the inside than the outside.  Definitely geared towards groups and families.  Lots of tvs and some arcade games inside.

One of my top things that gross me out are sticky tables and/or menus.  Both tables and menus were sticky.  Looking at some of the empty tables, they looked sticky/dirty, too.  

Our server was as nice as could be.  She asked if it was our first time there and we said yes.  The manager was sure to come over to see how everything was before we left, which was nice.

I, generally, don&#39;t like coming to places like this.  It seems like it&#39;s usually food that is all frozen and they just warm it up.  I&#39;m not a wing person, so I can&#39;t comment on that, but I did have a steak and mushroom quesadilla.  It was ok.  Had I known that the dipping sauce they serve with it, was pretty heavy on the horseraddish, I would have asked for ranch.  I guess I could have asked for it anyway, but I just left things be.  I had one of my husbands onion rings that they say are famous.  I didn&#39;t agree.. especially for the $4 that they cost.

If you&#39;re into the typical bar/restaurant atmosphere, that has a little something for the kids, with food that isn&#39;t bad, but nothing to rave about, this is a fine place.  I might have given it 3 stars if it weren&#39;t for the sticky menus and tables.  Just makes you question what else is dirty/sticky... ya know?"

My girlfriend and i waited about 10 minutes for our server Mariah to bring us silverware once our food came which she never did. I also noticed that we weren&#39;t the only table having an issue with her. She had other tables waiting for more drinks as well. We wound up asking someone else to bring us some silverware since she was nowhere to be found. She didn&#39;t even bother checking up on us until we were about done with the meal and ready for the check. She should consider herself lucky I tipped her at all because she definitely didn&#39;t deserve one. If anyone else winds up getting her as a server, be prepared for bad service.

They have an excellent selection of craft beer bottles and usually one or two local crafts on tap. 

The wings are tender large and juicy. You can get many flavors that will keep you coming back.

My first gripe is just corporate nonsense - why would you choose a name so similar to your already accomplished, well-known competitor?

Although I haven&#39;t had the opportunity to dine here, I did get some leftover wings.  It was some kind of garlic...I think it was &#34;roasted garlic.&#34;  The boneless wings are very good, and I was full after about 6 of these.  But the garlic sauce wasn&#39;t that great.

At first I was impressed by the thick, homemade blue cheese sauce.  That is, until I noticed the bits of celery in the sauce.  Yuck!  It really killed the blue cheese flavor.

&#34;Meh. I&#39;ve experienced better,&#34; is definitely my stance on the place.  There&#39;s no reason why I&#39;d pick this place over any Buffalo Wild Wings."

After seeing the Yelp reviews, we decided to give it a shot. Glad we did. Our server was the bartender (rocker looking dude with long hair and mustache). In spite of being very busy, he was extremely attentive, making it out from behind the bar numerous times to take our order and check on us. The food was delicious. I like the way you can pick the flavor of the wings and the &#34;heat&#34; separately (for example at BW3, Asian Zing is hot...here you can get it mild, medium, hot, flaming...). I only had 2 critiques (and the manager was very interested in listening and committing to discussion with the GM and improving). 1- the blue cheese they gave us was very &#34;blah&#34;. It tasted like...well....nothing....kinda sucked. 2- the garlic fries were AWESOME...but there were almost none on the plate. It was like paying $7 for a snack size fry at McD&#39;s.

The server was a female and she was quite slow and unattentive. My fiance got 10 wings- the garlic wings and some extra hot wings. They were okay, very large. You get 5 for $5.99. I got the gyro quesadilla which was yummy!

The second time we went, my fiance got 10 wings- the sweet barbeque and garlic-q. He got them in atomic and said they were pretty good. They came with celery sticks and ranch/blue cheese (he had specifically asked for two ranches). He got the Sam Adams Octoberfest beer and said it was good. When he asked what kind of specials they had today (a Sunday afternoon), the server asked &#34;Is it game day?&#34;.... of course it is... it is Sunday in October in the afternoon with all the TVS having diff football games on. Anyway, I got the gyro burger... there were only like 2 or 3 tiny pieces of gyro but the burger overall was delicious. Our server was very timid but he was super nice and attentive.... minus the issue at the bottom of this review.

The third time, I got a mushroom steak quesadilla. It came with some kind of mustard sauce. The quesadilla was good! Not the biggest fan of the mustard.

One big let down of this place is even though it has nice flat screen tvs playing football, all of the blinds are up so the sun makes every TV screen have a HUGE glare and it is very hard to see. Put your blinds down!

The food is also pretty pricey... especially for a place trying to compete with Buffalo Wild Wings.

This place has been pretty empty the two times we went on a football sunday early/late afternoon and Sunday afternoon/evening.

I would have given this a 4 star but I just got home and realized the server ripped us off... I had a B1G1 coupon. My fiance ordered 10 wings (plus a beer) and I got a burger. The server charged us for 2 separate 5 wings (making it $2 more expensive) and then rang a 5 wing as the get 1 free dish, saving us only $5.99, rather than having my $9.99 burger free."

the wings are meaty nothing like the skimpy wings you get at BWW.  The flavors are delish. My husband and i sat at the bar and had great service and of course the food was great. 

I wished we lived closer we would be here more often. 

We were told they can grill the wings over frying them.  I will have to try that next time.

It&#39;s massive, filling and delicious! Also reheats nicely if you don&#39;t finish the whole thing. There&#39;s a crazy sauce that comes with it that will leave you coming back for more!

Atmosphere: Go during a Chicago Blackhawks game. Nothing but true fans of the sport rooting for the Hawks and watching the game in their million massive screens all over the place! I&#39;ve gone there for 2 games--the wings, beer and high fives just kept on flowing. So much fun!

Service: No complaints. Everyone was really nice and attentive! Manager even came out and asked how everything was. 

Definitely WILL return!"

We go in there every month or so and the servers always mess something up.  Today, first it was wrong drink orders then wrong food order. I ordered the garlic Parmesan wings as I always do and the waiter brings out something else and his excuse was &#34;I only heard you say garlic&#34;.  Well, try writing it down next time or listening. Then he brings out a small bowl of Parmesan as if that is how to fix it. To make matters worse, the manager comes out and says that is how they make them -  apparently you have to mix them yourself although I never have before.  He then says this is his best waiter and we &#39;can leave&#39;.  So we did."

I&#39;m throwing in the towel and won&#39;t be returning to Buffalo Wings and Rings again.  We have been visiting this location for a while now but due to poor service and declining quality we won&#39;t be back.  

Our most recent experience was tonight.  We got there about 6:15 on a Friday night and it was about 1/3 full.  We were seated immediately and given menus.  We sat for 10 minutes before our very nice but flustered young server got to our table.  We asked her what was on tap.  She was able to name a few but many she just gave the brewers name (lagunitas, Solemn Oath, etc) but didn&#39;t know the actual beer.  My husband ordered the Lagunitas (which was the IPA) and I asked if she could tell me which Solemn Oath.  At the same time we ordered the buffalo chicken nachos which have always been our favorite.  She returned 5 minutes later with my hubbys beer, water and the kids drink but hadn&#39;t asked the bartender about the Solemn Oath.  She left again and returned shortly with the name.  I ordered a beer which she brought to me within 2-3 minutes.  She headed off to her other tables, one of which were friends or family.  She finally got back to take our order about 15 minutes later.  Our nachos arrived about 10 mins after ordering and were cold. Plus the tomatoes on them were all white and nasty.  Very disappointing, especially for $9.99!  The only good part was their blue cheese dressing which is fantastic!!  Our food finally was delivered, was ok, nothing special and we ate. She did bring our bill timely but charged us for the kids meal drink which she did take off after we told her about it.  It wasn&#39;t a terrible experience, it&#39;s not a bad place but it just isn&#39;t worth the hassle with so many other similar restaurants at our disposal."

The reason: the food is good and decently priced. The menu has a great variety, the salads are amazing, the wings are delicious (never frozen) and their wraps are great. I end up here because it is convenient and I really like the food.

The service is almost always pretty bad, or at least decent on good days. The one great server they have is John. Everyone else just doesn&#39;t seem to care or are horribly managed so they don&#39;t know what to do.

They have split TVs instead of a giant projector on the restaurant side. This is quite annoying while trying to watch a football game.

On Sundays they have a $4 Mimosa special but depending on the bartender the drink will be made completely different.

I wish this place would get their customer service act together because I really love their menu."

We ordered 48 boneless wings, four of each flavor (except for teriyaki), the bacon mac and cheese, and onion rings.  The wings were big, delicious and filling.  We each finished 15.. and we&#39;re big guys.  The Mac and Cheese was ok.  The first bite I took was great, but as the meal progressed it seemed to lose flavor.  I&#39;m still not sure if it was because the flavor of the wings overpowered it or if it was because I was just so damned hungry when we started eating.  The rings were good, but no different than most other places.

I would definitely like to compliment our server, Tom.  He was quick and attentive with everything and just a cool guy to talk to.

Would I go back?  Does a pimp powder his hand before an open-handed bitch slap?  Yes.  The answer is yes."

It feels like there should be some separation of the dining area so it doesn&#39;t feel like a school cafeteria. Service started out great for me, but once the other 2 members of our group came, our server somehow was stuck behind the bar and never came to ask if we wanted more drinks. He also got our order wrong and didn&#39;t come by to check on us after the food was delivered. Sabrina was the manager on duty that night, and I had asked to speak with her as we started to get irritated because we were hungry and thirsty on this Friday night. It took her a while to get to us, but she came, she apologized comped a good portion of our meal. Right before she got there, our server did come by, apologized as well and said he would comp the drinks. Most of our bills was comped, which is nice that we didn&#39;t have to ask, because let&#39;s face it, some places you have to argued to be comped for sub-par service.

I personally did not eat anything, but my group did like the boneless wings and wedges. I might get take out from here, but I don&#39;t know if I would be dining here again. But I did like the fact that the manager and server apologized for the mishaps."

The only redeeming factor about this it is the food is pretty good for a wings franchise. Here&#39;s a great example of why you shouldn&#39;t dine here though. Placed an order for wings, and the person who took it down clearly wasn&#39;t paying attention. Everything I ordered to go was wrong, and had to drive back after discovering it at home (my mistake not checking it there). I was told they could remake the order &#34;on the fly&#34; which took just as long as when I called it in. To top it all off, there was no offer to do anything to help make it right for me.

Most other times we have been in to eat at the restaurant, we received the same level of service. It seems like most of the staff here has no idea what they&#39;re doing, and it takes forever to get food when I&#39;ve been here in the past."

Would it hold up to other 5 star places we have rated? No, but for what it is, it&#39;s perfect. 
in my opinion, if you wanna eat good wings in the area, you can go here or crosstown.

The boneless wings are tender and juicy, and i am definitely a bone in wing guy. But they really can&#39;t be beat here.

And for the guy that wasted mine and everyone else&#39;s time, complaining about how the split screen tv made his eyes hurt.  Boo hoo, please don&#39;t waste adults time with your worthless reviews. If they messed up your order or their service was crap, by all means, post it up.

Firstly for us, the benchmark for wings in Naperville, is Crosstown Pub. But I gotta say BW&amp;R is by far one of the most freshly-prepared wing joints around. A bit too heavy on the sauces (swimming if you don&#39;t ask them to go light), but tasty and many varieties. The wings, I ask for extra crispy...combats the sauce. Ordered dry, not as good. The chicken strips are very good and burn your mouth (temperature) hot, every time. Portions are very good. Prices are reasonable. I like that. The dressings are made IN-HOUSE. The sauces are an exploration of sorts. Good stuff.

LOTS of TVs with sports. Good beer specials. (Good food specials, nightly, too!) Service has always been good for food, but we&#39;ve experienced a slow bar more than once which has me scratching my head for such a decent, solid place."

No.. BWW has a bunch of jerseys, and sports stuff hanging everywhere, its darker, and theres so many sauces to chose from. The boneless wings here are much better, larger, and juicier. I didn&#39;t try to many other menu items, but their new owners brought in a huge craft beer menu. That is what separates this place from BWW. Sure its more open, brighter and kind of almost sterile looking but there are plenty of TVs, the service during big games is still good. I didn&#39;t love it though. the sauces were good, not great, ( I tried about 5 of them).. For large groups they have this 75 wing package which is a good value.

First off, the selection of sauce and the selection of hotness was a nice touch. Most places just have a sauce and however hot it is, is what you get. I wanted to try their signature buffalo sauce, so I gave that a spin with extra hot as the temp. Unfortunately, their house sauce is nothing more than Louisiana Hot sauce with a couple extra spices. As for temperature, their extra hot wasn&#39;t even close to being hot.  Overall, the wings were average.

Now on to the major reason I gave BW&amp;Rs two stars, their gyros. The gyro they serve are precut strips of meat and not fresh off the spit. The sauce isn&#39;t bad, but it was like spreading it on a piece of paper, that&#39;s how bad the meat was. After I talked to the waitress about the gyro, I was informed that it wasn&#39;t a good seller so they went to the precut strips. Then she made the comment &#34;I wish you would have asked if it was fresh off the spit before ordering&#34;. Really? I would assume a place that has gyros all over the menu would have fresh cut off the spit. Maybe I&#39;m wrong, meh.

Due to the poor quality of food, average service and high prices, I will not be returning."

In the meantime, I will be at Buffalo Wild Wings with everyone else who tried you restaurant once and got a migraine watching your bizarre split TV configuration.

I was warned about your split TVs by numerous other people, but I had to see for myself, ugh! Eventually you will run out of first time visitors.

Within 5 minutes drive there are 20+ competitors with food just as good and big screen TVs that don&#39;t cause vertigo!

After less than 1 quarter of football I had to leave because the 4 TVs put together as 1 TV gave me a headache. It made me feel cross eyed.  It&#39;s like watching TV through window paines! 

Just admit your error and buy a projector, then I will return. If not, you will be out of business in a year.  

When the NHL and NBA playoffs start in a couple of months Buffalo Wild Wings will be packed full of paying customers and your place will be empty- all because of the split TVs.

Sincerely, (-u-)

To all prospective customers:

My guess is the owners/managers have never been to another bar to watch a game.  If they had, there would be no way in hell they would have approved such a strange configuration of TVs.  

I dare you to sit at the bar and watch an entire game. You will be rubbing your eyes within 1 minute!

People want to go out and watch a game, not get a headache!

What I like about this place that makes it different from others is you can choose how spicy you want the sauce and if you want your wings grilled. Service was great and I got my food quick."

I went on a Monday night with a friend and they were running a promotion for half off your entire bill (including alcohol), so the place was packed.  Unfortunately we were seated in the bar area, which normally I prefer, but the bartender was our waiter and he was already really busy with the bar.  I ordered some boneless wings (half hot and half super hot) and fries, along with a beer.  The beer came right out and we sat and waited for a while for the food, they were busy so I fully understand that and I wasn&#39;t complaining.  My problem was when the food arrived at our table, it was pretty obvious that the food had been sitting in back waiting for quite some time, because it was cold when it arrived.   I was going to send the food back, but we had a restless toddler with us and we had already waited quite a while, so we decided to just eat it.  The food was delicious and I could tell it would have been outstanding had it been hot.  The boneless wings are big and meaty with just the right amount of breading and sauce.  I can&#39;t wait to try this place again and hopefully get hot food.   I was expecting a Buffalo Wild Wings (BW3) knock off, but this place is much better than BW3.  BW3&#39;s boneless wings are almost all breading and very little chicken, this place is the opposite.  Also, unlike BW3, they actually serve your food on plates and not paper containers.  They also don&#39;t nickle and dime you to death with extra charges for ranch and celery the way BW3 does.  I will be back and hopefully my second visit will include hot food and update to the review and more stars."

This place has better food, service, and sports bar ambiance then Buffalo Wild Wings and is sure to be our go to place in the future. I had the boneless wings salad which was huge...everyone in my party really enjoyed there food overall. 

I cannot wait to stop by in the evening for drinks over a sporting event. It should be noted that they have beer taps at several of there tables which allow you to fill up your own beer.....can you ask for anything more?????

This place would be great for a sporting event as there are TV&#39;s everywhere!!!!!! CHECK THIS PLACE OUT"

Each and every time I&#39;ve been to Buffalo Wings and Rings the service has been extremely poor primarily due to the place being severely understaffed. Friday night with the hawks playing and they have 3 waiters in the entire dining area...really? 

The most recent visit, the waiter was running around, forgot about us so after 25 min, I chased him down on the other side of the restaurant and ask about the beverages we ordered. He apologized and said he would make sure it was taken off our bill. When we received the check, both drinks were on the bill as apparently the manager refused to take them off the bill despite the fact it was essentially delivered after our meal was over. It&#39;s only a few dollars so I didn&#39;t make an issue out of it, but decisions like this by management explains why the service here continues to be so poor."

Mostly pizza joints. When I saw that there a taco place that delivers I decided to at lease check this place out. 
We tried:
Pastor tacos and they were excellent. 
Steak tacos were okay alittle dry but I&#39;m not a steak taco guy. 
The steak torta my daughter ate is the size of 2 normal size tortas you normally get at most Mexican taco joints. 
Nacho came is a large container. They were OK not bad for the price. 
They gave us 4 different sauces and a side of lemon slices. 
Not bad for $22.00 and that included delivery
Delivery was about an hr. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s bad for a Friday night.
I will definitely try again. It&#39;s way better then pizza."

I should have been tipped off by the fact that I got hung up on twice before someone picked up.  When the food came, they had my order wrong so I called back to ask if they could send the correct thing.  The woman on the line tells me she had something else written down, but I know what I ordered.  They agree to exchange.  
In the mean time the rest of my family digs in, but they can barely eat it; the steak is hard and cold and gristle-y.  
About 20 minutes later I get my food and it&#39;s missing toppings.  My husband mentioned the bad experience to the delivery lady and she just says sorry and walks away.  Needless to say, we will not be ordering again."

Fortunately Taco Grill can hold its own. The burritos are just as good and for gods sake you can&#39;t beat the salsa bar. We have tried the conchinita, tacos, tortas, quesadillas - all of which were high quality and seasoned to perfection. 

The first time I stopped in to get carry-out the cooks were putting up dishes and I saw the monstrosity that is their torta. This is not your normal sandwich - this thing is huge!!! Not the normal bread im used to but it was super fresh and definitely enough for 2 people with a side of chips and salsa. 

If this isn&#39;t your normal place to go for Mexican I would strongly suggest you check this place out."

I had a Groupon and we ate ourselves silly for what would have been $30 for two. 

Hubby had the Carne Asada, and it came on a sizzling skillet (fajita style) with grilled green onions, cactus and peppers. It was DELISH!!!! It also came with 8 warm tortillas, pinto beans, and a fried bowl of pica di gallo and guacamole for the amazing low price of $10. The steak was really good.

I had the Tostada Special with Chicken which was two overflowing tostadas with rice and beans ($8) we also shared some delicious chunk guacamole for a starter and it was loaded with tomatoes and onions, just the way I like it!

Help yourself to the salsa buffet with gardinara and all sorts of salsas, clearly marked as far as what&#39;s hot and what&#39;s not. 

The dining area is a little rough, not the kind of place for a cozy dinner but very clean and tidy. I will make it my new go-to for quick Mexican. Can&#39;t wait to get back and try a few more things on the menu."

But the communication barrier (she didn&#39;t seem to understand any of the questions I was asking, and instead just kept pointing me to unrelated menu items!?!) the 15 minute wait, along w/being told about 10m in that they did not have the carnitas in stock (you know, the thing half these reviewers are raving about) did not start things off well, even more so when the 3 guys that ordered AFTER me got their meals first!

And then this nifty &#34;salsa&#34; bar but no pico de gallo (which I guess was a mixed blessing since she wanted to charge me $4 for a small bag of chips)

So I get my food and am all like, well at least it will be fantastic and worth the hassle, amiright??Yeah, notsomuch.My pastor taco was okay, if a bit on the dry side.But the enchilada combo (3 different types) came with, not rice and beans like most places (my bad for not reading and ordering them ala carte I suppose, **sigh**) but about a ton of cold lettuce???1/4 of the plate actually.
And to add insult to injury the enchiladas themselves were lukewarm and chewy (as opposed to hot and soft, as they should be).

To say I am disappointed is an understatement, and I am still on the fence about giving it another go. :/"

I got the Torta Hawaiiana and some chipotle peppers. My wife got tacos.

Wifey-poo loved the tacos but I didn&#39;t even get a good look at them. That torta was the most beautiful thing I&#39;ve ever seen. I mean, I&#39;m sure that my opinion will change once I see my firstborn, but until then...... seriously, I&#39;d like to frame a picture of it and put it on my desk at work.

It was so good that I stopped on my way home and got another one.
Seriously, 3 kinds of pork, avocado, tomatoes, onion, and melted cheese, on legit bread.


With such a generic name I drove past this place a few times and never looked twice. I will definitely be going in there weekly from now on.  The salsas that we tried were all legit. The spicy ones were flavorful, not just blindly spicy. Even the mild ones were legit - that&#39;s really rare. Normally &#34;mild&#34; just means &#34; boring&#34;......

The service here was very prompt and fast. Constantly brought out more chips to eat and assisted in anything that was needed.

Food came out very hot, and fast!! The pastor did not have much flavor to it. The pollo (chicken) was good and had some good seasonings on it. The seasoned steak was my favorite. It was juicy and seasoned brilliantly.

A very refreshing sizzling Carne Asada plate was flanked by guacamole, pico de gallo &amp; homemade beans. The steak shared center stage with a grilled trilogy of onions, hot peppers and cactus. Very Tasty.

Taco Grill is possibly the next generation of infused Mexican cuisine, or a vintage curbside chimichanga joint reclaiming the cast iron fajita plate. 

Final thoughts: An open Salsa Bar? One less star, don&#39;t really like the Golden Corral idea! No booze to consume here, one less star as well.

What?! Taco Grill and Salsa bar this close to my home? Is this real life??!!

Anyway on to the Carne Asada burrito. Omfg. Soooo good! Al Pastor tacos? Soooo good!... Next on my list is to try the guacamole... You see this is not my first run in with the ole Taco Bar. They have a location in Westmont that I would on occasion drive 20 minutes in the wrong direction to just because I had to have this ginormous burrito filled with real steak. I&#39;d say Los burritos gives them a run for the money but I&#39;d still venture to say Taco Bar may not only be the best burrito in Aurora, which is a task in of itself, but maybe the best Suburban Burrito in the Chi Town Burbs. 

It will run you about $9 for the grande big daddy mack burrito, but it is so worth it! They aren&#39;t kidding about the word grande, I mean this thing is serious. After I was full it was still the length of my forearm from wrist to elbow, not easy to get a selfie of that, I tried. Lol.

Last but not least is the Salsa bar. You&#39;ll see by my photos I&#39;m a sissy when it comes to xxxhot salsa, but they have like 20 of them, careful. You just dish out your own. It&#39;s pretty cool.

The people are awesome too! The girl at the front was so cute and fun, I think she could tell how excited I was and thought &#34;Why is this weirdo asking me like 1000 questions?&#34;. Hahaha. The owner also came out and asked if everything was good to the couple of tables that were filled. Oh btw, pretty decent amount of seating. Which you wouldn&#39;t guess from the storefront. 

Just give it a shot, if you&#39;re disappointed I&#39;ll buy you a burrito from anywhere you choose, that&#39;s how much i like this place!"

My husband enjoyed the carne asada. It was a large platter with a side of beans and sautéed vegetables. 
My daughter ordered the Cuban torta. It was a large sandwich. She said it was quite good and appeared to have a size able amount of filling. 
I enjoyed the vegetarian burrito. The vegetable filling was nicely seasoned. 
We also ordered the guacamole. It was very fresh with a lime flavor. 
And who can forget the salsa bar? With options from mild to extra hot, there were options for everyone. 
The restaurant was clean and the service was efficient .  
Parking in the back was convenient."

Seriously though, this place is no joke.  Nice chunks of garlic on the carne asada, tons of food for $10.75, all of it just delicious

The platter had carne asada, bulb green onions mixed with cactus, whole pinto beans (Also incredible, and I&#39;m not really a bean guy), and a baby taco salad shell filled with guacamole and pico de gallo.  

There were maybe 12 salsas to choose from as well from their salsa bar.

Very small and unassuming, but the food is worthy of any 4 star Mexican restaurant.  All for very cheap.  

The owner and waitress were as friendly as can be.  The kind of people you like to spend money on because the attitude and the food are great

I hope more people read these reviews because this place needs to stay open and thrive

Gotta love a place that&#39;s not afraid to actually season their food

The pro: Their delivery is super fast.

The con: Everything else. Their food is bland, bland, bland. We both ordered steak taco dinners, and it was awful. The meat tasted like nothing, the cheese was flavorless and rubbery. The beans are straight out of a can (I know homemade beans when I taste them, this place doesn&#39;t have &#39;em) and the tortillas aren&#39;t made here either.

The rice was okay, but overall, I can&#39;t stress enough how disappointed with this place I was. Not to mention expensive, it ended up being $35 w/tip for two steak taco dinners.

Still on the hunt for good Mexican food in Aurora."

After a few visits I asked about the food truck in back and they come to where I work on the west side of Aurora at least once a month!  The chicken seems to be cut up chunks of breast meat which is rare because most taquerias (not that this is a taqueria, it&#39;s a restaurant) use shredded dark and white meat.

Living in Aurora it can be easy to be skeptical about a new Mexican restaurant, but this place has what it takes to compete with the established elite in this city. They also have a secret weapon, THEY DELIVER!!  Long have the citizens of Aurora cried out for delivered Mexican food, and here we are nearly 180 years later and finally someone is making it happen. (I&#39;m not counting Hot Pechugas&#39; brief stint as their food was hit or miss, but mostly miss, along with vacuous people answering the phone.)  

As for the food, we have tried a few things over the last 3 meals in two weeks, and they have not let us down.  My favorite on the menu are their carnitas tacos, tender and flavorful, and like all their tacos are served on two corn tortillas garnished traditionally with onions and cilantro.  And why it is oddly difficult to find carnitas in this town remains an enigma, so kudos for that, too.  I found the al pastor pretty good, as well, and my wife considers herself an aficianado on the subject and she gives it two thumbs up.  Although to me their al pastor is on par with Jalisco&#39;s on Galena.  And if you want really good barbecoa you have to go somewhere else, because that is one area they lack in, but that is probably because they don&#39;t want to get crushed by Taco Munez, whose barbecoa is legendary and will one day unite the world in perfect harmony.

To garnish these delights they offer a bevy of salsa choices that range from spicy to v e r y spicy, after all they have Salsa Bar in the name. These add an incredible dimension to their tacos with flavors like chipotle barbacoa-esque, habenero cream and guacamole sauce that would make your gym shoes get devoured if you spilled any on them. (I&#39;m guessing on the exact flavor names as I haven&#39;t seen a name attached to them.)   There are also more traditional salsas to choose from with different heats. The owner&#39;s wife sometimes delivers the food, but she wasn&#39;t available one time so I went in to pick up our order and they let you choose your sauces and they offer around six or seven that are freshly made, along with pepper mixes. When delivered they tend to mix it up for you ala grab-bag style. The one thing I miss, though, is that they often mysteriously omit limes from the order on deliveries.

Their guacamole is terrific, if slightly sweet, and the housemade chips are even seasoned well and are quite tasty.

My wife has become quickly addicted to their al pastor tortas. Warning: they are enormous!  They are served in a toasted ~foot-long bolo bun and stuffed with your meat choice along with beans, avocado, tomato and mayo. She barely finishes half of it and takes the rest to work for lunch.

So spread the word, go onto Grubhub.com to order from them online for delivery or pickup, or dine in, and keep this place humming, I want them to stick around for quite a while!!"

The mild salsa tasted like tomato sauce from a can with a tiny, tiny bit of fresh chopped tomatoes, onion and cilantro added.  Seems like the hotter salsas were very good, I tried them but can&#39;t fully eat them because I can&#39;t handle spicy foods.  The quesadilla was wet on the bottom and a little soggy.  I ordered through grubhub.com to avoid language confusion.  I ordered Tex-Mex Tacos (Tex-Mex has lettuce, tomato, sour cream) and then wanted to add cilantro but it wasn&#39;t a selectable option so i added it in the notes by saying &#34;mild &amp; cilantro&#34;.  I ended up not getting Tex Mex tacos at all.  I got steak tacos with cilantro only.  I should have typed &#34;mild, please add cilantro to tex mex&#34;.  The chips were fine.  My kids liked the rice.  You get a huge quesadilla with the regular order (not kids size).  They should have Pico as a side if they don&#39;t.  I would have rather had that than the tomato sauce type mild salsa. 

Even though they deliver I probably won&#39;t order from here again.  I paid $34 for 1 Quesadilla, 3 steak tacos, 2 chips and salsa and a small order of guac and the steak tacos were dry and tough and the quesadilla was a bit soggy.  :(  To me that&#39;s a lot of money to not be satisfied."

Even if you don&#39;t like your food too spicy, you want to try the variety of salsas.  The downside to delivery is that you don&#39;t get that variety, and I always forget to ask for extra salsas, but I&#39;m sure they&#39;d throw them in if I did.  Some things don&#39;t stand up as well to delivery, but burritos and tortas survive the trip nicely."

I had it bookmarked and when some coworkers wanted to order out for lunch, we decided to try it.  We placed an order for delivery and were quoted an hour (long time, given we were down the street...but the hour and a half it ACTUALLY took was unacceptable).  Placing the order took about 15 minutes due to needing to repeat the order or portions of the order several times.  I actually had to pass the phone to a coworker to complete the order, as it took too long and I had a client I needed to work - and I was already running behind after spending 10 minutes trying to place a rather simple order.  We hoped the food would be worth the trouble, but not one of the three people who ordered were impressed.  I was told the tacos were &#34;meh&#34;, they forgot limes (which were requested), and the guacamole wasn&#39;t very good.  My one taco...the pastor taco...was not recognizable as a pastor taco and I still don&#39;t know what I actually ate (maybe the carnitas taco?).

I have returned to the restaurant many times and tried quite a few items. My favorite is the carne asada platter. It is a great bargain for the quality and amount of food you get. The tacos are not skimpy and just a few can fill the biggest eater. The salsas are made fresh and you can taste the difference. I love the green salsa that is made with avocado.

I don&#39;t give a shit. It&#39;s more fun and way less frustrating than anytime I&#39;ve ever been out on the course. 

They&#39;re kinda like Lucky Strike Lanes only the activity is golf and the food is much better. It&#39;s a driving range that has a bunch of targets to shoot for. The balls all have sensors so not only does the system tell you exactly how far your hitting, but you get points for getting close to the pin depending on what game you&#39;re playing. 

Full service bar and pretty decent food round out the experience so even if you&#39;ve never swung a club in your entire life you can still have a good time with your friends. I&#39;ll be back the next time I need to feel like learning this game is completely hopeless."

I was NOT expecting a place to hit golf balls and being so crowded and so club-like. Once I got used to the environment, I found TopGolf to be a lot of fun, but be prepared for it to be loud and be prepared for your wallet to be quite a bit lighter when you leave. 

Saturday nights are packed. Be ready to wait over 2 hours for a lane. Luckily, there is enough space and bars to get food and drinks while you wait. I thought the food was good and the drinks are definitely strong. You get what you pay for, and I didn&#39;t feel ripped off by the prices at all. We shared some chips and queso and one of the flatbreads. It came out pretty fast, especially with how crowded it was.i tried a few different drinks, and they were all made well. The DJ was spinning 90s boy band tracks, which is fun, but it also made me kind of feel like I was at a high school dance. It didn&#39;t bother me. 

Once you finally get to golf, you&#39;ve already paid out quite a bit. The golfing explanations go fast, and if you don&#39;t stop and think for a minute, you may be out of 50 or more bucks just to hit the balls. We had been there so long, we opted for the cheapest 30 minute time, which costs 25 bucks. 

This time goes by very fast, but I felt it was enough time to try it out and have fun. We ended the night with some donuts. The injectable donuts. If anything, you must get these! 3 flavors, hot little donut balls, and sauce syringes! A great combo! I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be back. But it gots to be on a payday weekend. :)"

We played a couple hours here the other night for a pal&#39;s birthday. The service was lagging- horribly- but our waitress let us know that they only had one bartender. I appreciate when servers communicate issues. 

I ordered the crab cakes and they were decent. Obviously, this is not a seafood restaurant. My husband got a huge burger with an egg and polished it off quickly. The doughnut holes are a diet ruiner for sure.

We dressed in Hawaiian wear, which made it more fun. After a dreary winter (though thankfully not too snowy), it was a nice reprieve from the cold. It just so happened to be 45-50 degrees that night which made it a nice and toasty 65-70 degress. To be honest, it felt like warmer, around 75-80 right under the lamps. I was sweating a little, but I would much rather it be too warm than freezing cold. I had on a sundress and light cardigan, so I was quite comfortable. 

We had a small sectional that sat 6 pretty closely. It worked well for us, though. The server brought food and drinks. I believe her name was Ashley and she was very friendly, prompt in service, and professional. She was able to accommodate us if we wanted something from the bar if not on the menu. I tried the Mushi which was interesting. Mexican sushi, if you will. So imagine the average burrito, a little thinner, and cut in slices. That&#39;s exactly what it is. So good for the day, but not sure if I would order it again. Some other food ordered by my friends included the chicken and waffles, brunch burger, chicken sandwich, ultimate fries, etc. Everyone enjoyed their food. I enjoyed their mojitos as well. 

The game is set up so that you hit balls into different colored areas and get points. I will admit I ended up just using the longest club &#34;wood&#34; and just hit it as hard as I could. I generally got into the yellow area...the closest one. Sometimes a little farther. But even for someone that has never hit golf balls, it was pretty fun. Go with a group and have a few that are good at golf and a few that are not so good at golf, and you&#39;ll have a fun time. 

Only complaints is that i&#39;s a little pricy. Also, I would feel a little safer if the safety net was larger. I didn&#39;t fall, but I&#39;m not the most graceful and don&#39;t see it as being impossible. A few drinks, swinging a club if you&#39;re not used to it, and being close to the ledge. I&#39;m surprised no one has fallen off the edge yet. By the end of the night, I had pictured myself falling off the ledge, catching my foot in the net, and falling down even further...every time I went up to play. 

Overall, I had a great time. Great food, great drinks, and a fun experience. We can&#39;t wait to come back!"

CLEAN! They have a clean, modern, atmosphere, great for afternoons with the kids or nights out with friends. The music is usually a great variety of new and vintage, and upbeat.

The food is amazing. They could use a few tips on their Old Fashioneds (get those better cherries and MUDDLE!)!but their food is very good. Currently enjoying the spinach goat cheese salad.

The tables and chairs are comfortable and hold up to about 6 people. Even better, you can reserve couched areas!

I am not a golfer. I hit my first ball today. But I will be back! If anything, to have a drink and laugh at how badly I hit the ball...

Topgolf is popular because it&#39;s a place where everyday Joe&#39;s and Jane&#39;s can go and golf and feel comfortable. There were these girls next to us, literally swinging the club like it was a shovel or other yard tool. Le sigh. 

It&#39;s also non-golfer friendly in that they supply you with a set of clubs at every bay.

Topgolf would get more points in my book if it wasn&#39;t so DAMN EXPENSIVE. Drinks- $10 (and $7 beer I think), the bays are $45/hr, and the food is just okay priced at like $15 for an okay-sized share plate. 

It&#39;as pretty cool how everything is digitized for the game. I believe all you yelpers know how it works- you get more points the closer to the flags you get. And, it is a brand new facility, I get that they are trying to recoup the costs.

But for someone like me who enjoys hitting balls, and appreciates a real game of golf, stick to the links."

The sleek and modern atmosphere is aesthetically appealing and the bays and other lounge areas offer comfortable seating for all in the party (plenty of room for spectators). There is a full menu and several fully-stocked bars, so come hungry and thirsty. You have a waiter that comes directly to your bay for you. 

As for the golf, there was a wide array of experience levels and that was ok! You are free to bring your own clubs, but they also have male and female clubs at each bay for you to use. There are different games with different objectives you can choose to play (free golf, longest drive, best chip, etc.), but again you do not need to be a golf pro to have a good time. The technology is neat and the area is pretty well temperature-controlled from what I can tell.

I&#39;ve been going to the one in Wood Dale for years and when I heard they were opening one in Naperville (I live in Wheaton), I was very excited.

This Topgolf is still pretty new, and it shows. The bays are clean and fairly well maintained. The food is typically excellent and the service is good (a little too good, I&#39;ll get to this). Overall, Topgolf is a lot of fun and a great alternative to the typical driving range or a fun day/night out.

Now, to explain my 2-star rating...

This Topgolf is overpriced. I would understand if these prices were set for weekends only, however it would still be overpriced, but that would make much more sense. But, we like to come during the week for dinner and some golf, it creates a nice break in the week and a nice night out. However, if we play for two hours on a Tuesday night (when it&#39;s empty) and have dinner, it&#39;s OVER $100! Just to give you an idea, from Open-Noon it&#39;s $25per hour, from Noon-5pm it&#39;s $35per hour and from 5pm-close it&#39;s $45per hour. Now, for a group of people, that actually isn&#39;t that much money when it&#39;s split. However, for two people to come on a weeknight, it&#39;s absolutely absurd. We end up paying $90 for two hours of Topgolf and then at least $50 for food and drinks. It&#39;s at least $150 for two hours out on a weeknight. THAT&#39;S CRAZY!

The staff is super friendly and helpful, although the lines can get long on weekends. However, the staff can be a bit overwhelming at times. I had to tell the nice kid SEVEN times that I&#39;d carry my own bag. Also, we were munching on our food over an hour or so and we literally we asked if we were done EIGHTEEN different times (yes, we counted after the 5th time). We couldn&#39;t tell if they genuinely were trying to see if we were done, or if they wanted us to leave. It was super overwhelming. 

Lastly, the machines are clearly brand new because I&#39;m yet to get one that works the whole time. On multiple occasions I dispensed a ball and immediately was given a 0 for that ball and then it skipped ahead 5 balls. I couldn&#39;t delete the balls it skipped and was stuck. It was very annoying. Topgolf could only issue an apology and that was it. Disappointing to say the least.

Overall, this Topgolf is beautiful and brand new. It&#39;s a VERY fun activity and something that we&#39;d love to continue doing weekly for a nice night out. However, if Topgolf doesn&#39;t adjust their pricing to make it affordable for a night out during the week, then we&#39;ll be forced to go elsewhere. This place id DYING for weekly eat &amp; play specials or just lower weekday pricing. It&#39;s just nowhere near affordable for a couple to come here for two hours + dinner during the week. 

Hopefully they adjust.

And, just to be clear, if I were reviewing JUST the game, it would easily be 5-stars. Absolutely love the game of Topgolf."

Golf outside in the Chicago winter?  With great food, drinks, and service?  And you don&#39;t freeze your a$$ off?  Yep.  Seriously, why the heck didn&#39;t I think of this?

This place is just too cool.  3 levels of golfing, and each party of 4 gets a private tee and table.
The food is great, there&#39;s a really good bar with a huge selection.

Even though it seemed super crowded the bar on the upper floor was had plenty of seating, and there were quite a number of activities to occupy yourself with while waiting (namely drinking for me) , which made it fly by. 

Only complaints being the noise level (could barely have a conversation without yelling while at the bar), and it was quite expensive to do just one hour which went by super quick. It&#39;s cheaper during off times. 

All in all, would definitely recommend it - though maybe not a great &#34;range&#34; for your standard golfer."

There was a huge line when we first arrived. You check in, tell them how many you are and pay. You need everyone&#39;s IDs as well. Each person needs a $5 card that you keep for the future and then it is $45 an hour on the weekend evenings so for our group of 6 it was $22 a person total (we did 2 hours). They also made sure to sit us right next to our other half of the group which was awesome. 

My fiance is left handed so they brought him out a set of left handed clubs free of charge which was great. If you have your own clubs you can bring them! They have overhead heaters but they were super hot so we turned them off. They also have plugs to charge your phone at your &#34;pod&#34;. Food was reasonably priced and delicious, but the service was a little slow with various people bringing things and then saying they would grab what you needed but forgetting. We had the fries, nachos, spring rolls, queso and guacamole and it was all really good. People also had wine and beer and seemed to like it and think the prices were reasonable. 

The golf itself was fun. They have a computer set up to keep track of who shoots, when and your score. There&#39;s various games you can play but we just did TopGolf. It was a really nice night out, they played great music and I was with fun people so we had a really awesome time! I definitely want to go back with my family."

Why would you pay $45 an hour for the same thing you can get, half the price, and without the feeling of being rushed over in Wood Dale? We had a party of 8, 2 were unable to play because we refused to get 2 bays and pay $90/hr. The staff tried to justify their pricing by saying its meant for parties. But hey, if you have the money to spend $45/hr on Topgolf alone, just go play a round golf. It&#39;s pretty much the same price. I get the concept too, keep people moving, open the bays, serve more, make more money and servers get more tips, that&#39;s all fine and dandy. But, I&#39;m not about spending that much and feeling rushed to get a game in vs a timer. We are planning on drinking and eating there for a while, we rushed through a game (with 6 people it took 58 minutes), ordered 1 drink each and left to go elsewhere.

The facility itself is beautiful. Excellent layout, I like the automated ball dispenser, I like the game. But, the pricing makes zero sense. It&#39;s a complete ripoff. And if the Wood Dale location changes pricing as well I would not visit Topgolf again."

Downside - very long wait to get the member card which you must have and another wait to play. $45 bills an hour plus food and drinks will leave a hole in your wallet- split the bay with a few people and not so bad.

Hour and 45 minute wait for a station on a Saturday. The one thing I really don&#39;t like is that if you get there at 3pm for the $35 an hour rate but they cannot get you a spot until 5pm then you are forced at the high $45 rate. The rates should be honored for at least the first hour for when you check in. 

For two people you will easily drop $100 for an hour of golf ($25-45 per hour plus the $5 membership cards as a one time fee), drinks at $5-12 a piece, food at $6-20 depending on apps or entree items. The mixed drinks and food are above standard quality but not the best you have ever had status. 

This is a low pressure golf place and more of a hangout. People of all skill levels will do fine here and the outdoor stations are heated. You will want to get in the middle and upstairs if possible because going too far left or right narrows your range.

Their staff is mostly high school/ college aged kids so the service could use some work. I&#39;ve not had a time where they go out of the way to take care of you but just don&#39;t expect to be oogled over or anything."

The food runner brought the food without silverware as well as the wrong side dish. However the server didn&#39;t come back to check on us so when she discovered the wrong side item it was at the end of my meal. No one refilled water even though it was hot and humid. I could see my server goofing off at the bar but not even looking in our direction.
There were plenty of servers but with no commitment to the guest.

I have two gripes  I mwith this place after being there 3 times in their first two weeks that if not fixed lol just take my money back to wooddale. 

1) is that $45 an hour after 5pm is a slap in the face to the top golf regulars. I get that it&#39;s Naperville and it&#39;s a new star of the art location but $45/he makes you rush therefore making it less fun. Discounts should be provided with purchase of drinks or food. I   Went there with 2 friends and we played a total of 4 games over 3 hours and all had ordered food and multiple drinks...ended up spending $100 each....I can play 4 18 hole rounds at good courses with golfnow rates for that much...

2) Most, not all, of the employees there are incompetent, rude, and just in the way. They&#39;ll try whatever they can to either waste your precious $45/hr time...and they know it. Then when they feel like you are done ordering from the bar or kitchen they&#39;ll be very pushy to get you out of there...

If they change the way the leagues are played and paid from how they do it in wooddale and ruin my winter plans... I might start a pocket line cuz I love the winter leagues.

Me and three other friends decided to go because we were bored and thought it would be a good time... and it definitely was. 

The atmosphere is excellent, feels like a high end hotel. The staff is excellent, extremely friendly and very knowledgeable. They gave us an overview and made sure we knew how to play the game before we started, extra melt welcoming to people who have not played golf in their lives. I did not eat but friends said their food was delicious and would come back just for that. Service was also excellent, made sure we had everything we needed, delivery was fast, and made regular check ups. 

Also, we went on a day where the high outside was 12 degrees, AND there were still a lot of people coming to play. The bays are heated, website gives the estimated temperature in the bay but it&#39;s something like 30 degrees higher than the outside temp. It was extremely comfortable and we all had a great time! 

They also provide a military discount, make sure to ask so you can also be a Lifetime Hero! 

 I highly recommend going to top golf."

The music selection was great and set at a volume enough for conversation or just dancing if that&#39;s your thing! This is an all-ages type venue with clubs available to rent, a caddy area if you bring your own. If you&#39;ve never been, it&#39;s kinda like the bowling alley but for golfers and a lot cooler.

Perfect time as its not very busy at all. I must say, I am very impressed. While walking in, the design made me feel like we had just walked into a very nice resort. The staff were friendly, informative and good at what they do. They made it stupid easy for us to get started and we had so much fun doing so. We had bloodymary&#39;s, chicken &amp; waffle sliders and a brisket samich and tots. All tasted excellent. The bloodymary was nothing special, but they did use Zing Zang as their mix that I really enjoy. So for me it was really good. I did add some Tabasco sauce to it to make it spicy. It&#39;s easy to drop some $$$$$ while playing golf there as its so much fun. The only thing I did not like was leaving.  we will for sure be back!!!"

Their food menu really sets them apart from their competition in a good way + they offer brunch on weekends.
     It&#39;s more budget friendly to play in the morning, so just a heads up. The price is 25/35/45 per hour depending on what time of the day it is. The price can be split by up to 6 players. The games were fun; it&#39;s definitely a place you should experience at least once. Reason for 4 stars is because I&#39;ve had to wait over 20 mins for the check and drinks have been hit or miss the few times I&#39;ve visited. Will I be back? Fo sho."

This place is obviously sweeping the nation in their marketplace, and I can see why. They have all of the qualities you would look for in a sports/activity attraction. Lots of TV&#39;s, big bar, lots of drinks, and of course golf! The prices seem a little ridiculous, but people are obviously willing to play. This location is great, and we played outside at the end of November when it was bitter cold out, all for my die-hard golf loving husband. The heat lamps helped a lot, but we were all bundled and brought in a blanket from the car. Also this was fun for non-golfers, but only for an hour."

So we decided to eat something while waiting. Walked around to find a table to sit at and everything was overcrowded. Finally found a high top table in the main bar and we sat there for 15 min and no server came by to take our order.

We then saw a spot open at the bar and sat down. We waited 25 min for a damn drink. They kept walking past us and never acknowledged us. Barstaff is extremely rude.

Now this is why we left a 5 star rating. Once we received our bay 303 around 10 00 PM we were greeted by the sweetest server there is. Her name was Jenna. She got us an order of the spring rolls (which were amazing) and brought us a drink. She kept checking on us every few minutes and even stopped to chit chat with me.

After all is said and done we asked her if they host weddings there and she said she wasn&#39;t sure and pointed us in the right direction. She also told us she would love to work our wedding. Give Jenna a raise and some recognition. Also we will be having her work the wedding.

Thanks Jenna you were amazing"

We made the trip from Chicago because this place was on the must do list.  We were not disappointed. From the time you walk up the steps and are greeted with a friendly welcome to the entire check in process the service was impeccable.  You have to see it to truly enjoy the experience. The ability for everyone to play the golf regardless of your skill level was part of the fun. Some people brought their own clubs which I thought was a it over the top.  The food was your typical bar food which was good but it great hence the 4 stars instead of 5. I would go back more often if it was closer to Chicago. I would tell everyone go and have a great time because if you can&#39;t here you won&#39;t anywhere else. The prices were reasonable and well worth the trip. I will be back?

Food was very good! Buffet style food stations were well stocked. Manager introduced himself to all our company&#39;s managers. I am a non golfer and I had a great time! The golfing bays were warm with heat lamps, you are not cold at all even though it was 20 degrees outside. Plenty of tvs everywhere with all sports on.

The facility is brand new and it&#39;s definitely a great night out. Here&#39;s my reason for the 2 star rating, it was EXPENSIVE. If you&#39;re looking to have a fun time then you better expect to spend at least $100. Cocktails are ok and food is decent, but I spent $100 on food and drinks alone for my gf and I. $100 for a couple beers, appetizer and couple sandwiches??? Not to mention the service at the tables SUCKED. It took wayyy too long for everything, BUT the service at the actual bay stations was pretty good. Overall, it&#39;s a great time especially with a group of friends, but prepare for the costs."

They were between staff shift change. It ended up being 45 minutes before we were assigned a spot. We originally paid 70$ for a 2 hour block. 35$/hr before 5. Well since our wait time was longer the price goes up to $45/hr at 5. This was not ok so a manager came over and we ended up paying only 55$ and he added a extra half hour to our playing time.

The only downfall is the prices, it gets more pricy the later in the day that you go.

Good was excellent and the service was good they had some computer glitches staff made up for it by adding more time for us. We ordered the chicken nachos. They also provide there own golf clubs if you don&#39;t have any. The pre programmed games are fun great to practice hitting targets. Not an avid golfer my self but there is a mix of everything here. More of social place to eat drink and have fun. Open late on weekends. Would def return there are heaters in all the bay&#39;s so makes it easier to return in the winter. When we where there it was raining heavy did not effect our game or experience everything is covered.

We&#39;re not good golfers, so it&#39;s fun to hit the balls and actually make it competitive with their scoring. Sometimes the computers don&#39;t register the points but we can alter that if we notice it. Food and drinks are always good too. 
However, the services we&#39;ve received have varied time to time.
1st time: It was great, she was on point.
2nd time: We just had beers and the server was quick about it.
3rd time: We had to ask for a server after waiting awhile and didn&#39;t see her anymore until we re done playing. We had to get a pitcher of beer from the bar.
4th time: Service was prompt and attentive until we needed silverware and plates. But then as soon as our bay time expired and paid (still finishing our drinks), they started clearing our table so quickly and trying to grab some of our waters out of the way. We felt we were being kicked out and rushed toward the end, so the last five minutes were a little sour.

Nonetheless, we&#39;ll be back. I just don&#39;t expect much from the service. But everyone at the front desk and the greeters are always so welcoming and accommodating."

Two hours of golf balls in two bays, downstairs by the couches with TVs in each one, free XBox an PS as well as pool available (they were all about hitting balls). We had a dedicated server, Alex, who made the kids feel like rock stars, and although this was a drop off party, the dads stuck around for the most part and we made plans for us meeting up and having some fun here. The best part? When the tractor cam around to pick up balls, of course there was a frenzy trying to hit it, the driver made sure to make extra passes by the kids even though the balls were all picked up.

There were about six or seven bartenders and you still had to wait and wave them down to get service. At the end of the night I was givin two separate bills but they were not separated properly. I paid $140 in cash to the manager and was never given my receipt. I know I put 20% extra on the bill for tip but I think gratuity was automatically added. Also my buddy&#39;s wife ordered a hamburger that was not done properly so they told her they would take it off the bill but never did.

This man is nicer than what would be Jesus&#39; and the Pope&#39;s baby. We had no food and haven&#39;t eaten for hours, he understood that. We scavenged all of our change to pay for an order of fries to spit between us men. He recognized that we do not have enough money for anything else and wanted to make our stay at top golf the best ever. He decided to throw in a chip basket for us. That was only the beginning of this mans journey to make our night the greatest. He continued to refill our chip basket 3 times. Every time he refilled the chip basket. It make our experience more and more extravagant. At the end of our stay we asked how much for the check and he gave us the best 4 words us pals could hear, &#34;Don&#39;t worry about it.&#34; If you ever see this Jesus of a person.

I just finished up a full afternoon at top golf and had such a freaking good time.  The service was top notch.  The prices were exactly what I&#39;d expect - $25 before noon, $35 noon to 5 and I don&#39;t remember the price after 5, but I think $45.  While that can be high for a solo person, this place wasn&#39;t designed for golf practice.  It&#39;s definitely a new alternative to bowling.  The food was fantastic and fairly priced.  The average entree was around 10.00.  I didn&#39;t dislike 1 of the 5 fruity cocktails I tried.  Also, they had a pretty good coors/Miller/bud beer special - $3 running...on a weekend!  4 out of 300+ balls counted as 0&#39;s when they were supposed to be awarded point values, which is much less of a margin of error than I&#39;d expect.

My mom came back RAVING. Let me not indulge in stereotypes, but we are a Black family, and no one...not a cousin, uncle, brother or sister has EVER golfed. So. For my mother to come back going on and on about the decadent food spread and golfing off private individual platform balconies was crazy. So when an organization I am part of hosted a party here I knew I had to make sure I made it. I swung a golf club for the first time ever at 26 years old and I did horribly, but atleast I hit it! They had  yummy food out for us and me and my friends finished the night off with the injectable donut holes. That was a very tasty mess. They had live acoustic music from a great singer playing on the first floor, along with people of all ages golfing and playing dance games. I can&#39;t wait to come again."

It&#39;s a little pricey but a fun time.  All employees there need a little more training.  From check in, to getting a bay, to getting a drink all need to be improved.  For the amount of staff they have on hand and the price paid the service should be top notch, which it was far from.  Hopefully they get people trained up and there is an improvement."

If your playing golf and not just eating this is actually nicer and cheaper than the other one but both are great. Everything has been upgraded since this is a new location but the staff was very friendly helpful and making everything as easy as they can get it. I&#39;ll be going here from now on

It&#39;s a great concept and a good time for anybody regardless of golf skill level. It does take a little bit of time to register for your membership card so I would recommend doing that through the app or their website ahead of time if you can.

The staff was super friendly and helpful. I know a lot of people complain about the price and I agree it&#39;s expensive at night, but it&#39;s in Naperville so what did you expect? I went in the morning with 3 other people and so we split the $50 total cost for 2 hours amongst the 4 of us which I thought was a bargain.

The only real problem I have with this place is that our group had 4-5 balls not register (Mostly in the front of the blue target) when we clearly saw them drop in a target and that ultimately changed the outcome of 2 of our games. Disappointing but not a deal breaker since we didn&#39;t take the games too seriously."

This is something that experienced golfers AND people who can barely hit the ball (like me) can do to have a good time. I highly suggest coming in a group of people (each bay can hold up to ten people), because the hourly rates for the bays are pricey and the wait for a bay can be hours long (we waited three hours the last time I went).

I called on a rainy Sunday to ask about wait times and was told an hour.  When I showed up with my two boys twenty minutes later I was told the wait was going to be two hours.  The concierge suggested we could wait in the bar.  Great idea with 10 and 11 year old boys; lots for them to do in a bar for two hours.

The guy behind the bar didn&#39;t know what dark rum was!!!!! When we finally got to our table, my friend ordered a Chocolate martini from the server. They brought her a glass covered in chocolate syrup with vodka inside. Also, the server had no clue what he was doing....looked like a deer in headlights.

They told us two and a half hours so we left and had dinner.  When we returned they added 45 minutes so we waited in car. Then they added another 45 minutes explaining people with VIP passes get to jump the line.  I had been there before and it&#39;s fun.  But they should be honest about wait times.  We left.  Have to think twice about returning on a weekend night.

The place is gorgeous, and clean and brand spankin&#39; new. So that&#39;s all good.  It&#39;s more expensive than Woodale but not dramatically. Just different because you&#39;re paying by the hour vs the number of balls. Before noon it&#39;s $25 an hour which is enough for 3 people to comfortably play two games  so still not horrible. But I don&#39;t know that I would pay $45 an hour at night. Especially like a Tuesday night. Those prices should be only for Friday and Saturday nights.  We had brunch, a fruit plate, chicken and waffles, which were really good and French toast, which was sickeningly sweet.  The Bloody Mary which was $8 for smallish glass was still really good.  

Where they struggled was on customer service.  There were some that were really great, like the older woman who greeted us at the door and our server, Monique.  Beyond them, not great. The golf hostess knew nothing. In fact she said the closer targets had higher point values... Not true. They said we could add additional time from the bay, didn&#39;t work. And it took 15 minutes trying to find someone who could figure out how to work it to get more time. Finally the manager added another $25 hour but was not the friendliest person.  And the oddest thing was that there were a lot of employees just in my way. Going to the bathroom I felt like I needed football pads on since there were literally 6 workers blocking my path and not moving for a paying customer.  Here&#39;s the thing.... If I&#39;m paying high level prices, I&#39;m going to expect high level service.  Management probably needs to jump on this aspect or they&#39;re not going to make it.  Granted it will take some time for word to get out that they&#39;re open, but it was less than 1/4 full before noon.  Hopefully they get the kinks worked out because they have a virtual goldmine there if they work it right.  Great location and cleaner and nicer than Woodale."

We started at the bar where we got to experience one of her son&#39;s early experiences ordering drinks.  He ordered a Houdini, a bourbon mixed drink with a sidecar of a piece of bacon.  Bacon?  Ok, he loved it!  On top of it, a stranger at the bar who lived in the neighborhood overheard the story about him being a first timer and generously offered to buy our first round. Nice guy!
We all enjoyed our dinners.  I had the new pot-roast style short ribs.
As a finale, after my girlfriend had snuck some advice to our waiter that both her son and I were celebrating birthdays, she brought us each a dessert with candle.
All in all, it was a very rewarding experience for all of us.  We typically go there as a nice neighborhood restaurant but in this case, everyone went above the call of duty (even the stranger at the bar) making it a memorable birthday experience."

Absolutely nothing special about this place.  Drinks were good and we had a good, attentive waitress.

The food was pretty ordinary and the portions seemed relatively small. One of us got a soup that was not hot, but was sent back to the kitchen for a warm up. 

For the price, I feel that the portions,  especially the sides ( my asparagus side was 7 very thin stalks) should be larger.

Too many other spots to really recommend this- unless you are at the show."

I got the Brentwood Chicken Sandwich.  Can you really go wrong with a chicken sandwich?  Yes, you can, however, the Chicken was sooooo good!  The seasoning was tasty and they even charred the chicken, so that made it even better.  The bun was a sweet hamburger bun and don&#39;t even get me started on the Chipotle Mayo.  I am a sucker for Chipotle Mayo.  It was AMAZING!  The fries were great.  So... I was being a fat kid and order the Creme Brulee LOL.  It was actually very good!

This location is the only Houlihan&#39;s I&#39;ve really ever spent some time at. Well, minus the one time I blew thru the Houlihan&#39;s in the city on a segway bar crawl, but my memory from that visit is a bit...fuzzy.

Any-who, me and the Naperville Houlihan&#39;s go way back. I had my first 21 year old drink there (at midnight...like a baller)! The bartenders were a lot of fun and made me a lunch box shot. I&#39;ve also really dove into their long island menu and appetizers over the years. I&#39;m not positive that they still do this, but it used to be half off long islands on Tuesdays &amp; Thursdays, which was awesome.

At my most recent visit (last week) I met my mom and brothers for lunch to celebrate my 27th birthday. Although it was 1 pm on a Friday (a tad early for happy hour), I decided to get a drink because hey, it&#39;s my birthday! I went with the Angry Orchard Long Island Iced Tea which was very good. A little more sour than I was expecting, but pretty tasty. For $9 however, I feel like it should have either been larger or had more booze. Just sayin.

For lunch I ordered the grilled atlantic salmon entree combo. I started with a cup of chicken tortilla which was good. Not the best I&#39;ve ever had, but it was fine. The salmon came with honest gold mashers and my choice of either asparagus or green beans - I went with asparagus.

I thought my meal was very good and it was the perfect portion. Everything tasted fresh and fancy for the price. Which would have been $11.95, but I had a birthday coupon for a free entree!

Pro tip: Sign up for their e-mails! They like to reward you for that. I&#39;ve gotten a free entree and $10 off when you spend $30 or more (so far)!"

Briefly:  calamari was nothing special and very small portion for almost $10 disguised in a Chinese takeout carton.  2. Ribs had to be the worst I&#39;ve ever had.  It was like they were microwaved and then thrown on the grill to make char marks (not grill marks), like black char marks, then rubbery, barely any sauce, fatty, and barely warm.  3. Did you want some fries with your salt?  After about four fries I threw in the towel they were so salty.  

Side of fruit was very good, lively blackberries, blueberries etc.  kids liked the potato soup.  Waitress was pleasant enough but waited 15-20 minutes for the check.  

Two stars may have been too nice.

I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be going back because of the food selection. I got the shrimp tacos, which were arguably the best I&#39;ve ever had, but there wasnt really anything else on the menu that interested me. I&#39;m by no means a picky eater, but the menu just seemed uninteresting. 

There doesn&#39;t seem to be any culture to the place either - it&#39;s a basic, dimly-lit restaurant that serves healthy food and an extensive (and overpriced) selection of alcoholic beverages. They just don&#39;t have that marketable piece to get customers talking.

Service is always good even though it can get very crowded. Sit at the bar if you are able. Plus there is a kids&#39; menu with some pretty standard options.

We went in around 7:30pm and the place was pretty empty. We both ordered burgers well done and I also started with a salad. I got the house salad with cheddar cheese, ranch and no bacon. I told my fiancé to remind me not to get a salad there again; they&#39;re just so boring and it wasn&#39;t worth the additional price. The fries were amazing and I love the pickles the food came with, but our burgers were both ordered very well done and there was still pink in the middle. We didn&#39;t want to make a fuss and it was already getting late so we just ate around it. We also tried their new Snickers crunch dessert, which was good and large. However, we didn&#39;t really like the kaluha fudge sauce, the liquor was overpowering and didn&#39;t really mesh well. 

Our bill was $42 plus tax and tip which I found to be expensive for a last minute dinner for 2 that consisted of mostly burgers. We might be back again in the future, but it won&#39;t be our first choice any longer. I will say our service was very good."

Originally they rated higher for me but since my last visit I am not sure if I&#39;ll bother going back. First of all they changed the birthday reward to force you to buy an entree first in order to get your free one. Not everyone wants to wait until a friend has free time. Just a shitty downgrade to a &#34;reward&#34; if you ask me. Now to this terrible trip. So I get there and it&#39;s packed and I&#39;m told it&#39;ll be a 35 min wait. No problem. Me and my friends brought their kids (young kids mind you) so it was a group of 5. First the dumb blonde hostess rings our buzzer by mistake. Understandable. But then she lies to us and says they are cleaning the table. For 15 mins? But she keeps the lie up. We stand there waiting and waiting and then she seats a party of 5 that came after us. Yep this idiot gave away our table with us and the kids standing RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER. I would have left but my friends walked there. So the manager says she will comp us an app. Which she doesn&#39;t when we get the bill and have to then tell them to comp. The waitress tells me I can get all these things on the reward but when I order the sliders &#34;oops that&#39;s actually considered an app&#34; she gets them to allow it but I wouldn&#39;t have bothered had she not told me I could. Also they were dry and I disliked them but I didn&#39;t bother to complain since apparently they can&#39;t even get simple things like seating and comping correct. House salad is good. The &#34;long islands&#34; are weak as hell.

It&#39;s relaxed but much nicer than similar chain restaurants.  Our drinks are always great and the food is fantastic!  I don&#39;t remember Houlihan&#39;s food being this memorable when I tried it a few years back.

I must commend the management here, any time we have ever had an issue they have been more than willing to make it perfect.  I cannot recommend this place any more!  Not to mention their patio is the best spot in the summertime paired with their awesome drink specials.  We usually sit at the bar when weather is not permitting.  Many of the bartenders are friendly and will share a few laughs with you.

If you&#39;re not part of the email club already, you should consider joining.  Every Sunday they have a select bottle of wine for $15 bucks!  Half the time that&#39;s why we&#39;re headed there. 

*Shout out to some of our menu favorites:
-Seared Georges Bank Scallops
-So. Cal Fish Tacos
-Thai Grilled Chicken
-Chicken Parmesan
(I&#39;m not one to order salads out but the House Salad with blue cheese crumbles and balsamic vinaigrette is so good!)"

Service was very good.  The dishes, including the French fry appetizer, the veggie sides, and my steak, were over salted.  Overall I think the remake of the brand a few years ago has improved the place."
houlihans-naperville,Samantha B.,z8tSKvUcx0hlnojKLxgSYQ,"Naperville, IL",0,1,1,1444,4,rl6sV1CXQMBdSj5aTnucyA,5.0,2014-05-17,"Wow! What a transformation from the last time that I was here. This place really takes advice to heart and implements changes immediately.

I went here tonight for dinner and I was extremely impressed. We were kindly greeted by the hostess and seated in a huge, comfortable booth. Within a minute of being seated, a server came by to talk to us about their specials, take our drink orders and ask us if we had any questions about the menu. Unlike, the last time we were here, the server was dressed very professionally. No large, flashy jewelry hanging from the neck or unbutton blouse, just simple black attire and hair neatly pulled back.

We started with two appetizers: the classic spinach dip with cheesy lavosh crackers ($10.25) and the parmesan fries with three dipping sauces ($5.95). The fries they initally brought out were cold, but a woman whom I believed to be one of the managers sincerely apologized and immediately fixed the problem bringing us out fresh, hot fries with truffle mayo, chipotle ketchup, and garlic parmesan dipping sauces. They were amazing! The spinach dip and lavosh crackers were out of this world. The dip was hot and the crackers were huge, covered in tomatoes, cheese, and cilantro. They were wonderful!

We then ordered our entrees: the chicken breast stuffed with garlic herb cream cheese, which came with mashed potatoes and asparagus ($16.95), and the 3-pack sliders which came with one pot roast slider, one black angus slider, and one pulled pork slider ($11). The chicken was cooked to perfection, with a wonderful golden panko breading. The mashed potatoes were fluffy and had so much flavor and the asparagus was fresh and well seasoned. I would love to tell you how the sliders were, but we only got through one because we were so stuffed (the black angus slider was delicious)!

Our server and the managers of Houlihan&#39;s were absolutely amazing. Like I said, the transformation in the service (and food) from the last time I went to now was just unbelievable. We never once had to ask for refills and they continually came by to ask us how our meal was and if they could get us anything else, as they cleared used plates from our table. Love that! Nothing bothers me more than when I have to flag a server down for refills or when I have dirty plates sitting in front of me.

We ended our evening with an apple pie dessert that was covered in streusal crumbles and vanilla ice cream ($5.95). It was good, but it would have been a lot better if it were hot. That is really the only comment I can make about the entire meal. Everything else was perfect. In the end, the bill only came to $55 which I think is a great price for the amount of food received and the portion sizes. We left with so many leftovers!

I would sincerely like to thank Faryle Scott, Joe Dydio and the staff of Houlihan&#39;s for a wonderful dinner and outstanding customer service. I very much look forward to my next visit!"

Not only that,  but they are a scratch kitchen so all their sauces are made before the store opens not from a can!   Our server was Christian and the general manager Joseph also stopped by to ensure we were satisfied.    We had the Ahi tuna appetizer the Wasabi sauce was perfectly prepared and not too spicy.    The fish and chips were prepared perfect as well,   the dill sauce was a nice twist and so much better than plain old tartar sauce.   Then to top it off the apple pie with vanilla ice cream was so delicious!   We&#39;ll definitively be returning soon."

Well, job well done, Houlihan&#39;s. Service was friendly, quick and I got the correct order and cooked perfectly. My husband had the tilapia fish tacos which were served with chips and salsa. The fish was coated in a crispy panko and the fish flaky and moist. I had a bite...or two...so I could review the tacos.  I ordered the ahi tuna salad. The tuna was seared rare just like I like it and was sushi grade and so fresh. The salad was packed with flavor and crunch....cashews, crispy wontons, carrots, banana chips and crisp cold lettuce served with a banana-ginger vinaigrette...this salad was awesome!  I&#39;m glad I gave this place a second chance. Houlihan&#39;s redeemed themselves this visit."

I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s cause it was less busy or just the set up in general, but I liked it a bit more.
I had the stuffed chicken breast with asparagus and mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes were really good. The asparagus was good..the 4 mini stalks I had. The stuffed chicken breast was tasty, but a little over done and hard. They have long islands for $3 during the week (I think Monday - Thursday). However, they are no longer the pitchers of Long Islands.

To begin with... $3 long islands with many different flavors and the best boneless wings I&#39;ve ever had! Their boneless wings have a delicious honey-like aftertaste and amazing homemade blue cheese.

Their baked potato soup is a must! The best I&#39;ve had anywhere, I crave it often and it&#39;s one of the things that brings me back.

The frites were decent, but not too notable and the burgers were good. They have a pretty wide variety of food so everyone should be able to find something they like on the menu, for reasonable prices as well! 

I&#39;ve never had a chance to experience their happy hour but they have 1/2 price apps for a few hours each day! Can&#39;t wait to go back."

The owner of Houlihan&#39;s advised the manager of my initial review and provided him my email. The manager got in touch with me via email apologizing and stating that he tracked down my order and had a discussion with the waitress who served us that night and also addressed the matter at his staff meeting. A week after our correspondence, I received two $25 vouchers in the mail with a hand written letter. It was a nice gesture and I appreciated the quick response.

My husband and I returned on 8/15 for an early dinner. We were quickly greeted upon entering and were immediately seated and assigned a bubbly and attentive waitress. She serviced our table efficiently the entire time. Our drinks were refilled before we finished them and she checked in to make sure everything was ok. Two managers also checked in with my husband and I to ensure we were pleased with the food and service.

The food was good and I received a complimentary dessert since it was my birthday. You must try the apple pie. It is delicious!

Houlihan&#39;s has redeemed themselves. Everything was complimentary this time around. I have no complaints and only positive things to say about my latest visit. We will surely come back to enjoy the food and spirits. Thank you for addressing my concerns. It&#39;s nice to have a local establishment that truly cares and caters to the consumer."

We have two young-ish boys (10 and 5), and we were getting tired of the same places every week. The first thing the server did was bring out two plates of baby carrots and ranch for the kids. I thought that was a nice touch! 

My oldest got the French Onion Soup because he just wasn&#39;t feeling the kid&#39;s menu that day, and he absolutely loved it. The younger one got some Mac and Cheese with a side of chips and salsa. He ate so much chips and salsa that he ended up not touching the mac and cheese, which was just the boxed Kraft stuff. They do advertise it as such, so I can&#39;t say anything too much about it, but it was congealed and thick by the time they brought it out. I&#39;m sure he wouldn&#39;t have minded it, because hey - mac and cheese. But like I said, he was too full to even touch it.  

I ordered the grilled salmon, which came with a side of mashed potatoes and some grilled asparagus. The salmon was a tad dry, but still very delicious. It came with a dill cream sauce which I&#39;m sure would have helped with the dryness, but I didn&#39;t use it. The asparagus was cooked perfectly, and the mashed potatoes were good too. 

My husband ordered the shrimp tacos, and he loved those as well. You get two tacos completely filled stuffed to the max with goodness! I didn&#39;t try them, but my husband said they were delicious.  

All in all we were pretty satisfied with our dinner. The only reason I&#39;m not giving Houlihan&#39;s five stars is the lack-luster service. Our server was a nice enough kid, but a bit spacy and not very enthusiastic. I&#39;m not saying jump around and be merry, but a smile would be nice."

We highly recommend the Tomato Bisque soup with grilled cheese fritters. The soup itself wasn&#39;t too acidic and had a good consistency of being brothy and thick; the grilled cheese fritters were crunchy and cheesy, but not too cheesy and went perfectly with the Tomato bisque. 

The grilled asparagus is a can&#39;t miss! They were perfectly grilled and season and with a squeeze of lemon on them to really make eating veggies easy! 

You can&#39;t beat 3$ Long Islands either, I recommend the Kentucky tea for the bourbon lovers! 

The service was amazing! That&#39;s one thing that really stuck out, Houlihan&#39;s over all can be a little pricy, but the service was and usually always is on point.

They try to be decorative on their menu and do things like &#34;ginger soy&#34; dipping sauce with calamari instead of marinara but it just doesn&#39;t work because it&#39;s not executed well.  Their flatbreads are alright, but nothing special. Depending on the day their crusts are either too thin or remind me of pizza luncheables.    Presentation has a lack of care.  I ordered the baked potato soup (tasted quite good) and it was sloppily spilled over the cup.  It just seems like no body cares there which is really disappointing.  

I will continue to go for their drink specials.  They have half priced cocktails &amp; long island drinks Mon-Thurs and on Tuesdays if half bottle wine night.  I will turn to Houlihan&#39;s for their bar which is pleasant.  There is even a nice patio outside for the summer.  

Go for their drinks, skip the food, and tip the bartenders well."

The asparagus that came with it hadn&#39;t been trimmed, so it was tough and woody.  Another person at our table ordered a mushroom flatbread, it came to the table cold and had to be sent back.   They did not make a fresh one, they ran it under their salamander or broiler so it came out burned in places.  By the time it came to the table everyone else was finished.  So when it was discovered that they didn&#39;t even make the right one ( tomato and basil instead of mushroom) it was decided to just eat it rather than send it back a 2nd time and wait another 15 minutes. They need some serious training in that kitchen, would not go back."

1) Open late (after 9-10pm)
2) Reasonably quiet (no loud music, excess noise)
3) Well lit (Enough to write/read; no &#34;mood&#34; lighting)

Houlihan&#39;s in Naperville made all of this possible.  After visiting the Oak Brook location recently, I wasn&#39;t expecting anything fantastic (sour mix-flavored Long Island, semi-noisy bar).  But Naperville is totally different.  The decor is modern and chic, perfect for happy hour drinks after work, or a date night.

The bar is separated from the rest of the restaurant.  We were seated in a cozy corner booth, near the brick fireplace.  I enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere - I didn&#39;t even notice the 8 or so teenager seated close to us.

The half-price Long Islands are good.  I&#39;d definitely go here for drinks and have the Georgia Peach Long Island again.  The Texas still isn&#39;t worth trying, but maybe it&#39;s the tequila.

The food is okay.  What you&#39;d expect for a casual, American dining establishment.  My fiancee had a bacon cheeseburger, and I had the grilled chicken sandwich.  The pretzel roll and gouda cheese was a nice touch.  But I wouldn&#39;t go back here just for the food.  However, the artichoke bisque soup was really good and perfect for a cold night.

I&#39;d definitely visit again for after-work drinks or a nice date night to relax.  It&#39;s nice that it&#39;s right by the movie theater too."

I have sat both at the bar and in the dining area and had great service every time, even when they are busy. They don&#39;t have a huge draught beer selection, but there are usually at least a couple of beers worth drinking. The food is great, especially the chicken sandwich (I forget the exact name of it, but it is delicious!). I&#39;ve also tried the nachos, pretzels, and a flat bread and it has all been good."

But, I received a &#34;get $15 off a $30+ purchase&#34; offer, so my boyfriend and I went for dinner on Friday night. A great experience all around, and nothing like Chilis! :)

+ Friendly and efficient staff, and no wait for a table, even on Friday night (at a restaurant by the movie theater!)
+ Nice ambiance (dim but not dark, not too loud, cushy dark wood booths and funky paintings on the walls)
+ A subset of the menu with a selection of smaller sized entrees 
+ No trouble using my coupon, AND they gave us a little box of cookies to take home too!

We started with artichoke-goat cheese poppers, little fried balls of tastiness on a pool of balsamic and remoulade. Classier than stuffed jalapenos, and yummier too. 

I went with one of the little entrees (a 4 oz. petite filet, which came with fries), so that I could also have a cup of baked potato soup. May I mention again the refreshing option of the smaller plates? In a culinary culture where dishes are 3x bigger than your head, someone who just can&#39;t eat that much (and thus doesn&#39;t want to spend all that $$) appreciates having the portion choice -- though since we are so used to seeing servings worthy of &#34;Man vs. Food&#34; everywhere, a 4 oz. steak looks absurdly small. But with a cup of soup, fries and half an appetizer, it was perfect for me! The steak was cooked perfectly medium, tender and delicious.

My boyfriend partook of the sliders, selecting four: pot roast, pulled pork, Creekstone Farms (Angus cheeseburger), and veggie, his favorite being the latter. I had a nibble of the pulled pork, which could have stood up against the wares at many a barbeque place. 

Overall, while this is a chain, it&#39;s definitely a step up, and a good deal of thought appears to have been put into their menu to make it creative and not the same old stuff you see all over the place. 
While we went because of the coupon, we&#39;ll be back because of the service and the food. Hooray for Houlihan&#39;s!"

Sometimes they got a wait, so be patient! I ate here once with my family and we had a long wait for the food too. I love burgers so I got the spicy frito burger without the fritos and they were delicious! 

What&#39;s good about this place is that they have a &#34;small plates&#34; section with lots of varieties of food if you&#39;re not a big eater or you come in with a group of people that you feel comfortable sharing a bunch of small plates with. In a classy type of ambiance, it&#39;s really a homey/family style at the end.

We found a spot at the bar and were ignored by the bartenders who were too busy talking to each other to be bothered to wait on us. 

Our table was ready quickly and we were seated at which time we ordered beers. Approximately 10 mins later, our beers were brought (how long  does it take to grab 2 bottles of beer.?) and they were not what we ordered. I would not drink Bud Light if you paid me. Another 10 mins went by and finally we got our correct beers. I ordered fish tacos, which were good, although the salsa that they are served with was bland and boring.  My boyfriend had the pot roast which he characterized as salty and nothing special.  The bill was almost $70, which seems like quite a bit for average food, a couple of beers, and very mediocre service."

I had the Grilled Salmon Panzanella (perfectly grilled, over Tuscan white beans, romaine, tomatoes, cucs, croutons, kalamata olives and creamy goat cheese with a balsamic vinigrette) . I ate every bite. Superb, simple preparation.

Alcohol 5/5 stars: The drink specials here, especially Sunday-Thursday are absolutely perfect! Half off all house cocktails, LONG ISLANDS, and other drinks, and on Tuesday&#39;s wine bottles are included. The drinks here are strong, delicious and affordable. This is the perfect place to spend time with friends, get a little tipsy and hang out without an annoying bar scene. My personal favorite drink is the Tennessee Long Island :)

Food/Restaurant-ness 3ish/5 stars: For the prices on the menu and less than enticing food specials, it&#39;s so not worth it! The food is a glamorized TGI Friday&#39;s and I only usually order it if I am dying of hunger while enjoying their wonderful drinks.

A group of friends &amp; I went to this location on a Friday night to celebrate one of our birthdays. We called ahead and made reservations for 6 pm. While on the phone we were told we would have to get out of the dining room by 7:30 pm because they had a &#34;holiday party&#34; coming then. Reluctantly we agreed, thinking we could just go sit at the bar after we ate our food. We had a good dinner, but we were bugged the whole time by the manager and a lady we came to find out was a concierge. As soon as we were done with something, they&#39;d come and take it. They asked a hundred times what else we needed. In my opinion, their job is to make us more comfortable, not rush us or make us feel uncomfortable. We were cutting it close to the 7:30 mark but we noticed there were other tables still there as well. We told the server we were feeling rushed when he asked if we wanted to order dessert. We told him about the 7:30 thing and he got upset for us. He told us to take our time. We saw the manager and hostesses pointing at us and then shortly after saw our server having a disagreement with them about how we were being treated. After a couple of other tables left, they rearranged those and sat the &#34;holiday party&#34; (which turned out to be 10 high school aged girls) right next to us... and I mean right next to us... meaning you could not walk in between our chairs and the girls&#39; chairs. We waited anxiously for our checks to come and be able to pay so we could get the heck out of there. We decided not to go to the bar to hang out and take our business elsewhere where they would not treat us poorly. Our server apologized and wished us a Merry Christmas. If it wasn&#39;t for him we probably would have had to end early and walk out."

The hostesses still look like deer in headlights but the servers have been more pleasant and seem like they actually enjoy their jobs.  Plus with all the specials they keep running I can&#39;t help but be filled to the brim for little dollar.  

I also have seen the management on the floor a lot more often, doing table touches and helping problem-solve if something isn&#39;t going right with a table.  I appreciate that, as well.

I probobly am a harsh critic cause I&#39;m in the industry. As a restaurant manager we strive to give my customers the best quality and service we can. $85.00 for dinner for three I expect more. This Houlihan&#39;s has been hit or miss in both departments.

Tonight for example...

Served a room temperature Martini. I should have sent it back.
Ordered wings, buffalo style. Took forever to come out. Got some sweet chili sauce and they were cold and fatty. We were starving so we ate them anyway.

Nitpicking here...My son and I ordered the steak and wedge salad. I&#39;ve had it before and love it. The presentation this time struck me as strange. They came out on huge plates with all the food to one side and the other half of the plate empty. Just found that weird.

My wife enjoyed her halibut...so I&#39;m doomed to come back here.

Then there was the service. We were checked on three times through drinks, appetizer and dinner. I did not utter a single complaint. Why not? My wife thinks I&#39;m being a snob when I do. I should have just been a snob.

Our server spent more time sitting with her girlfriends at the next table chatting then she did attending to her guests. Managers walked right past her several times so I assume that&#39;s acceptable behavior at this particular store.

That was just tonight. We have had good visits and bad visits. It&#39;s right by our favorite theater so we end up there after more often than not. My wife likes the food. After tonight I&#39;m going to try to talk her into the sushi place instead."

First the good: Its usually easy to park and get a table.  The service has always been pretty good for us and the restaurant is very modern and clean.

The Bad:  They have been changing their menu more lately, which also seems to mean higher prices and poor execution of the entrees.  There also seems to be more up-charges for things.  They killed my favorite meal the &#34;Big Fancy Spaghetti&#34;.  I had the breaded pork sandwich, which seemed well intended, but very bland.  My wife had a basic burger and we had a spinach dip for an appetizer.   We only ordered water and with tax and tip our bill was over $45 for two of us.   I have no problem paying that for a really good dinner, but our dinner felt more like a $25 dinner.  If Houlihan&#39;s really wants to push that price point they need to also up the quality of the food.  Perhaps the management needs to sit down at a place like Cheesecake Factory and figure it out instead of being an overpriced TGI Fridays."

The last time I was there, we were seated in a booth which felt quite intimate. The food was great, and I loved the presentation of the appetizers we&#39;d ordered. The calimari was brought out in a Chinese to-go box because it was served with a sesame-ginger sauce. When the sliders came out, they were almost too cute to eat. We also ordered the Jumbo stuffed &#39;shrooms and they were definitely JUMBO. For an entree I ordered the spaghetti with shrimp, scallops &amp; mussels. For a pasta dish, this actually tasted light and the amount of seafood to pasta ratio was perfect. I didn&#39;t feel cheated out of enough &#34;meat&#34;. 

The reason I gave 3 stars is because of the service. I know it was late but if the restaurant is opened late the severs should still be upbeat and attentive. There were only two other tables of patrons in the dinning room, it was only busy at the bar but I don&#39;t think they once asked if we needed a refill on drinks. I had to flag her down for a refill and the check. I hope that the next time I stop in they&#39;ve addressed this issue."

The Houlihan&#39;s of my childhood was a hodge-podge of Americana (or at least the foods that appeal to our cultural melting pot) that served drinks in ridiculous ceramic figures (several of which still adorn my desk today). A family place with crayons and simple dishes.

Uh... 180 much?

Trendy, trendy, trendy and about as different as can be. The menu seems to emphasize sharing and togetherness, which is great if the food wasn&#39;t drowned out by the music. Kinda a dichotomy if the menu suggests, &#34;Eat! Share! Laugh!&#34; and the music counters, &#34;WHAT?!&#34; 

A few more entrees for vegetarians (or kids) would&#39;ve been welcome, as I left hungry. Our waitress was a firecracker and hilarious to boot, always a welcome bonus to liven up a meal."

Great bartenders, though if it is busy they don&#39;t come around as frequently as some people may like. However, they always seem to keep my water glass full (maybe it is because I am a regular and tip well, or maybe that&#39;s just how they are). 

Tons of options on the small plates menu, and ever since they rolled that out I basically only order off of it. Love the hummus and pita bread, chop salad, spinach and artichoke dip, mac and cheese, pretty much EVERYTHING on that menu! And all very reasonably priced.

Happy hour drink specials Sun-Thurs keep me constantly suggesting Houlihan&#39;s for social gatherings on weeknights, and I am rarely left unsatisfied."

The calamari is good, of course their coctail drinks are amazing, my wife likes the Mango Mojito very much, so it&#39;s worth a try. Also we tried the pasta, I believe that was pasta with alfredo sauce, it was very nice, subtle tasting and the portion is not so overwhelming, we actually split it.

Fiance and I flew in from Seattle for the holidays. Friends wanted to have dinner here. Because I&#39;ve had nothing but great experiences in other Houlihan&#39;s locations, I said why not. Plus, it was a first for my fiance.

Busy night. Waited about 7 minutes for a table. Our waitress came to take our drink order. Everyone but me ordered non-alcoholic beverages. I asked for a PomTini...which I got about 20 minutes later cause she was too busy chatting up a storm with the bartender. Finally, she brought it out and it tasted like a virgin drink. I didn&#39;t want to make the evening unpleasant so I let it go.

She came around to take our food order. She listened and repeated or dishes.

Not once did she come around to ask for refills on friends&#39; or fiance&#39;s drinks...only if I wanted another PomTini. Instead, I ordered a Tequila Sunrise. Fifteen minutes later 3 out of 5 meals arrived. Fiance and I had to wait a while longer for ours.

AFTER our food arrived, my drink did too. Still, no offers on refills.

I ordered the Steak Fajitas, which were suprisingly delicious. My fiance&#39;s food on the other hand, he ordered the French Dip. His mashed potatoes were cold, they used Parmesan cheese instead of Provolone or Swiss cheese, which are not as sharp. The meat tasted like cheap Deli meat.

The only thing out of his meal that was pleasant, was the bread. Sucked that his first time was not the best. And now he isn&#39;t interested in coming back again.

Poor service. Poor kitchen management.

Hate to say it, but I have no interest in coming back either."

Gave it three tries. I wanted it to be good... I live super close!

First time, horrible. Inedible. Swearing we&#39;d never go back.

Second time,  we were told that we couldn&#39;t get delivery, the delivery guys went home early. In addition, the kitchen was closing early.

Third time, we are starving. Got a pizza and garlic bread. Garlic bread is horrible. Pizza is worse. It&#39;s stale, tasteless, inedible.

I now live near a pizza place out of state that can&#39;t find my very large apartment complex a mile away.  Dan has fair prices, they are comparable to the same items at chain pizza places.  Some are lower.  The pizza is not deep dish, but they do offer stuffed crust, which is a double decker thin crust.  If you miss Connie&#39;s it might work."

In that small unsuspecting location, looking like just another home town pizza place. Meanwhile slinging that pizza so good folks be calling their mamas. 

On my search to find the BEST local pizza spot, Sharon H. and Stephanie P. told me about Dan&#39;s Pizza. They were right, it&#39;s fantastic! They&#39;ve been around for 35 years and now I know why.

Last evening I ordered a Dan&#39;s Special which has sausage green peppers, onions and mushrooms on thin crust. So much flavor. The onions, peppers and mushrooms were sliced perfectly thin, while the sausage was in nice juicy chunks.  The sauce was just right.  But the crust is amazing. It&#39;s thin, crispy but not burnt, with that nice soft doughy layer just before the sauce and toppings. Just typing about it has my mouth watering.  

I&#39;m SO looking forward to trying more Dan&#39;s creations.  The menu isn&#39;t huge, but if half the items are as tasty as the Dan&#39;s Special, I&#39;ll definitely become a regular customer."

We decided to let Yelp guide our way, and figured we&#39;d try a pizza place we haven&#39;t ordered from...  and so we were led to Dan&#39;s pizza!

Ordered up on the phone, a 14 inch Dan special for $20, and 30 minutes for pick up.

Upon arriving, it&#39;s key to note that this place is take out only!  This is not a sit down restaurant, but that&#39;s perfect as we were ready to chow down on some pizza and start our Breaking Bad &#34;marathon&#34; for the night.  

Dan, the owner, was there talking to each customer, making sure that every pizza was getting out as quick as possible.  We checked out the menu, and noticed that there was a logo on the wall that looked identical to one of our local favs - Papa&#39;s Pizza... and it&#39;s at that point, Dan let us know that the owner of Papa&#39;s is his brother!  

Per Dan&#39;s words - the pizza is the same, except our crust is a little bit thicker.  And true to word, their crust was slightly denser, but also carried the toppings a bit better as well... Papa&#39;s has a shatteringly crisp crust at times, but Dan&#39;s has a better balance of holding the whole pizza together.

Verdict:  Great pizza, friendly service!  Is it so different from Papa&#39;s that we&#39;d travel more for it?  Probably not...since we have a Papa&#39;s less than a mile away... but seriously tasty take out."

We order from Dan&#39;s because my husband likes their BBQ pizza. It&#39;s not a bad pizza place but the quality isn&#39;t consistent. There are times when we order from here and the cheese is so stringy as it&#39;s breaking apart and there&#39;s other times the cheese falls apart in clumps. It&#39;s strange. Just recently we ordered from Dan&#39;s and I had a piece of the BBQ pizza. The bacon felt more like I was chewing on a piece of gristle. It was so gross, I had to spit it out. Step it up and be more consistent with good quality ingredients and this could be the best pizza place in the Lisle/Downers Grove area. Because of the inconsistency in their food quality I feel 2 stars is a fair rating."

The crust was the right amount of crispiness. The sauce was really good to. 

I think they&#39;re a little on the pricey side. We had a $2 off coupon, I don&#39;t think we would have paid regular price. $15 for a 14in. with half sausage and half cheese.

A few great things about Dan&#39;s pizza:
1. The crust is cracker crisp and thin - different than the flabby NY style thin crust.
2. The sauce is just about perfect, slightly sweet and with the right amount of spice.
3. Toppings are ALWAYS fresh (no canned mushrooms!)
4. Dan wraps the pizza&#39;s in a bag instead of a box. Not sure why but I love it!

This is home of the double decker, if you don&#39;t know what that is, you&#39;re missing out in life. So do yourself a favor, call today and save yourself from the misery that is ordinary pizza."

This pizza was one of the worst pizzas that I have had in awhile. In college I might have thought this was an average pizza pie but I&#39;m not drunk at 1 am anymore. Not enough sauce or toppings. The cheese was waxy with poor taste. 
Outside of the pizza, the young lady working there wasn&#39;t very friendly.  

I wont be eating this pizza again."

Excellent thin crust pizza, among the best in the Chicago area. Pretty good italian beef sandwiches too although most pizza places/hot dog stands all have the same quality beef sandwiches. Fries are good. But it&#39;s the pizza that is the standout here. It&#39;s just a little place with no seating, pick up only (not sure if they deliver, we live close by and have always picked up). Been there since the late 70&#39;s or so, same owner, same quality for decades, never had a bad pizza from them. They have a lunch deal M-F, pizza slices for $2.50 or so. Huge slices. Great deal on a very tasty lunch."
dans-pizza-downers-grove,John S.,vI22sWvPDeYqhqn7QOjGgg,"Downers Grove, IL",0,1,0,0,24,PXHJbZaDb_1D-nRMPLXXnA,4.0,2012-12-02,"I can see Dan&#39;s Pizza from my window and have lived here since 1999, so I have finally decided to getting around to reviewing it here...

My favorite thing at Dan&#39;s is the cheesy garlic bread.  It is the perfect mix of all the ingredients, AND it is cooked and served just like it should be.  The bread is warm and firm, not soft or hard.  The cheese is melted to chewy deliciousness.  The garlic is subtle, not overpowering nor non-existent.  YUMMY!

The hot dogs, Polish sausage, and fries are also all very good.  They can be be bought separately or together.  I usually get one hot dog with fries plus one extra hot dog.  Hot peppers are available when requested.

I have never tried the beef, bar-b-q beef, or Italian sausage, but that is only due to my preferences for the items already mentioned.

Of course, the pizza is the main reason that people order from Dan&#39;s...  The toppings are generous.  The crust is thin or &#34;double-decker&#34;.  I have never had a Dan&#39;s pizza that was served at the wrong temperature.  (Of course, I live nearby.)  The sauce tastes more like tomato paste than some of the other local pizzerias in the Downers Grove area.  If you like your sauce to have less spice then you will not go wrong.

The prices are very reasonable, especially for the portion/amount received.

Dan&#39;s Pizza is located just east of the I-335 and Maple Avenue interchange, so it has quick access to all nearby suburbs.  They also deliver to a wide area and are open seven days a week.

Enjoy!

Dan&#39;s was pretty good, we will be back to try it again.  Pizza toppings were good: it was not a cheese-goo pie, the peppers were fresh, and the whole pie was sprinkled with black pepper.   That was useful, because the sauce was pretty neutral to my tastes.  The crust on the large pie was crispy, on the small it seemed a bit chewy.

The kids all liked it, the garlic bread was popular.  $35 for a small and a large pie w/garlic bread."

Theres something about seeing the owner of the place cutting pizzas that just makes me smile.

I&#39;ve had pretty much everything and its all pretty good but for definite favorite is the BBQ pizza. Nothing crazy or even that special its just a solidly made BBQ pizza with sausage, bacon, and onion.

Also I recommend bringing a few quarters and picking up early cuz theres a badass old school Pac Man machine there.

Of all the pizza I have had in the WORLD, this is by far the best!!  The sauce is zesty and sweet all at the same time.  The sausage, if you like that sort of thing, is the best quality and best tasting I&#39;ve ever had.  (So take that New York!)  And the thin crust is crispy and never flimsy.

But the pizza is why you go to Dan&#39;s not the ambiance. Looking for a pizza that will fill you up, try the double Decker pizza, which has two layers of crust with sauce in between. This is what we get every time, but a single layer pizza is just as good and there are many topping to choose from including pineapple and jalepeno peppers.

We recently attended the &#34;Porking Lot&#34; party at Famous Dave&#39;s. They were roasting a whole hog and giving out free sandwiches. It was a giant party. The local country radio station was broadcasting live and the fire department showed up. They even had a dunk tank and free snow cones which were perfect on a day with a heat index above 100. I must say that the owners threw one great party for the community. 

We were melting outside and decided to move inside. AC never felt so good to me. We decided to keep our BBQ party going by starting out with some burnt ends. These were really good. My little one dived in. It was her first burnt end and she loved them. My little foodie loves everything. The dish even came with onion straws which are always good. 

For our entrees my wife decided to go healthy and she ordered the cedar plank salmon. That&#39;s a little too healthy for me at a BBQ joint. I did have a little bite and it tasted good. I decided to go manly and order the two meat platter with two sides and corn bread. For my two sides I went with beans and Mac n Cheese. I must say the Mac was one of the best ones I&#39;ve had in a while. I loved that it had a kick to it with jalapeños added in. I had several meats to choose from but I choose to go with pulled pork &amp; beef brisket. Both were very good but I love the pulled pork the best. Why do BBQ joints serve white bread? I have no idea. I didn&#39;t eat the two slices that the meat was sitting on but I did enjoy the corn bread muffin. I&#39;m a sucker for those. 

Our little one had soup and chicken fingers. She loves soup even on a hot day. I think she ordered the chicken rice and she wanted more when she was done with it. We ended up packing her chicken fingers to go but they didn&#39;t make it back to Chicago. They became a snack in the car for the family as we sat in a total standstill on the 290. We were very lucky because we might have not survived it back to Chicago without that treat. 

Our waitress was really amazing. In fact, the whole staff was really nice. We had a great time with all of the festivities happening outside and had a great late lunch inside. It was so worth the drive for us to get our BBQ on in the burbs. Now I know why Dave is so famous, it&#39;s because he provides a family fun space to enjoy smoked meats and meat is good."

She ordered the appetizer nachos and I got the burnt ends and ribs. The environment was very lame. No music in the back ground so you could over hear everyone&#39;s conversation. Staff was friendly but not personable. The food was hot but expensive for the size portions you got. The burnt ends were mostly left over fat and the ribs weren&#39;t eatable due to the toughness. The nachos were great and the cornbread was phenomenal. The manager did discount the bill $12 which covered the cost of the ribs.

Food is consistently terrific, and priced at what you&#39;d expect.  I love variety--after all, variety IS the spice of life--so I typically opt for the multi-meat combo platter that comes with 2 sides and cornbread.  Most recently, I got the rib tips with pulled pork, cheesy mac and baked beans.  The BBQ was nice and tender, slow-cooked and very flavorful.  Dave&#39;s mac-n-cheese is extra cheesy and has diced jalapenos in it.  So good.  The baked beans were slightly better than average and I wouldn&#39;t change a damn thing about their cornbread.

I love to see that they feature country-style desserts on their menu, like bread pudding and pecan pie.  I&#39;m usually far too stuffed to get one, but someday I will, knowing I won&#39;t likely be disappointed.  Would return, *will* return, and definitely recommend for those in the mood for some tasty BBQ action, apart from Chuck&#39;s (Darien on Cass) and Uncle Bub&#39;s (Westmont on Cass)."

2 years ago we had some really bad experiences here, mostly take-out, and abandoned them for a year and went to other places.  When they remodeled, we decided to give them another chance.  We ate in and the food was very much improved.  Famous Dave&#39;s never has really wowed me, but they never was really horrible either.  But when we started going inside, we saw better quality food.  

So what do you think happened today when we decided to give take out another shot?  Baby backs and St. Louis spare ribs was overcooked.  Had to go back up there to have it corrected.

The food wasn&#39;t very good at all.  The only thing that kept me from walking out of here is that we had a gift card.  Our total bill came to $40+, and I promise you that Famous Dave&#39;s &#34;barbecue&#34; isn&#39;t even worth half of that.

The restaurant was busy on a Saturday night, but not that busy, because there were many empty tables and bar stools.  But the hostess appeared flustered and overwhelmed when I asked for a table for 2.

Our server was really nice, but as I already said, we waited far too long for food that is already cooked.  She walked past our table many times without stopping to check in or question where our food was.  I overheard one of the bartenders say they were out of margarita mix - on a night that they had the servers promoting a special margarita.  Good thing I didn&#39;t order the margarita.

I had the pulled chicken sandwich, which looked like depressing cafeteria food on my plate.  I drowned my sandwich and fries in their sassy sauce, the only redeeming quality in the restaurant.  I tried my husband&#39;s brisket - it was awful.  The cornbread was good too, but I&#39;m not coming back here because they have good corn bread and ONE decent sauce.  

Famous Dave&#39;s is trying too hard to drum up business.  They now have a bar menu, but you can only order from that menu if you sit in the bar area.  Obviously they&#39;re trying to boost liquor sales, but I doubt this will end well when a customer, seated in the dining room, pitches a fit over a flatbread.  If you want bar food, go to a bar."

It&#39;s the food that was really disappointing. We both ordered the texas beef brisket sandwich with mashed potatoes on the side (my husband) and kids mac and cheese for my son for an upcharge (me).  

First comes the mac and cheese which really! it is KRAFT brand mac and cheese out of the box. That&#39;s not even real cheese in there!!! I told the waitress and she confirmed it. They just call it kids mac and cheese to make it &#34;more friendly&#34; as she put it. Hilarious! 

Then come the two brisket sandwiches. Basically, it was a little pretzel bun with 3 pickle slivers on the side of a giant dinner plate. My husband received a tiny side of mashed potato in a dish the size of a dwarf. The beef brisket meal (which tasted ok nothing to write home about) is priced at around $10.45, so I kinda expected a little bit more on that huge dinner plate. For that much, and I&#39;m not even a big eater, I can get a decent, satisfactory meal at any other comparable dine-in restaurant, and real mac and cheese at panera or noodles &amp; company any day of the week. 

I&#39;m sorry but this is my honest opinion about this joint. Will not go back ever and will not recommend this place."

I had the Salmon (sides can be substituted) and Boneless Chicken Wings with my fiance. The salmon and chicken was tender and all overall was good but I felt like they poured salt on there without even tasting it. A couple days of this and my blood pressure would probably go through the roof. I had to take it home and being Asian, probably mix rice with it later. 

Other than the sodium content, the food was okay and service was good. This place is a chain so it&#39;s so-so and my guess is food is about the same from one place to another. I would come here if I&#39;m craving ribs from time to time, so if you dig this kind of food, you should check it out."

None of them really said it was great or it was terrible just that it was decent.  I was picking up some furniture nearby and had a hankering for ribs so I figured I&#39;d give it a try.  

It was Saturday night and I arrived around 8:30pm so I expected a long wait.  To my surprise the restaurant moved through the wait list very quickly and followed the best practice of &#34;under promise over deliver&#34; when it comes to the quoted wait time. 

After only 8-10 minutes we were sat.  The server took a really long time getting to our table to take orders.  It was somewhere around the 5 minute mark that I started getting fidgety and perturbed.  Finally after another 2 minutes the server did arrive and took our drinks and meals orders as we had plenty of time to figure it out.  

I had the ribs and rib tips combo for my meal.  On the side I had the famous fries, corn on the cob, and another side I can&#39;t even remember now??? The ribs were decent, the rib tips were fairly fatty but pretty tasty.  The famous fries were not great (not sure what&#39;s so famous about them).  Corn was flavorless and cold.  

After the meal there was a fairly long gap to get our check too.  

Overall it&#39;s just an ok place nothing special for me.  I do prefer to get my ribs from an up and coming competitor (Q BBQ).  So I am not going to recommend Famous Dave&#39;s."

I don&#39;t really like to leave a bad review but this was just gross. I ordered the combo plate with boneless wings that were soggy and the cut pork. I decided to cut the serving in half and luckily I did because I found two human hairs barried in the pork and BBQ sauce. Gross. I was going to put it aside and my boyfriend was going to give me some of his ribs and when he lifted three of them up to put them on my plate and that&#39;s when we saw a third hair. 

We waited 15 mjn for our waitress to appear when we told her she just said ok and walked away. She returned with a manager who tried to tell us that they could be hairs from the sauce brush but once she saw them she said oh yeah those are human and then said she would take care of our food and offered to remake but we both declined. There&#39;s something wrong when the hair is on two separate plates I wouldn&#39;t trust the kitchen. And then they just kinda took our plays and left us there."

They have pretty darn good ribs, chopped pork (basically pulled pork), brisket, BBQ chicken, burgers... just about everything!
I am a big cole slaw fan and theirs is one of the best. A little tangy and just the right amount of sauce. Speaking of sauce, they have a bunch for you to try on the table- my favorite is the standard &#34;rich and sassy.&#34;
The menu is expansive, and you can choose one or two sides with just about any entree- I recommend the fries (more like thick cut wedges) and cole slaw.

Being from St Louis, I didn&#39;t realize I was at a chain restaurant.. so much damn flavor! The BBQ sauce is also fantastic. My daughter loved her ribs and beans. The only food downside was the mac and cheese. Cheese sauce was watery and tasteless. They put chopped jalapeños in it, which sounded good, but did not compliment the dish.

I went 3 times (twice to this one and once to another) and a visit yesterday makes four. I was not happy to say the least. 

The portions are so tiny now,  which is off-putting from the get go. Yesterday which is the spark for this review, I ordered the lunch plate of a stuffed baked potato. It comes with one side of choice and a cornbread. 

The potato is advertised so you can choose a barbecue meat, and it includes cheddar sauce, bacon, sour cream, and butter. There&#39;s also two other options- one including fresh broccoli. I ordered the fresh broccoli option and asked for no meat. I received a good sized potato with no sour cream, a little butter, a light sprinkle of shredded cheddar cheese (not melted), huge pieces of broccoli, no cheese sauce, and no bacon. It was dry and sad looking. I had to ask for cheese sauce, more butter, and sour cream. Why advertise it as included in the platter if I have to ask for it seperately? 

It was tastey once I rebuilt the potato properly, but it was a disappointing first impression for that menu option. I would still recommend this restaurant for the food, it is good, and the barbecue sauces are the best! Just be aware when ordering. 

PS- you MUST try the bread pudding dessert!"

And after a recent visit, it&#39;s definitely worth it to visit again if you haven&#39;t been in a while. They have a new Modern BBQ bar menu being offered which is a refreshing update to what is traditionally known as BBQ fare. We had a chance to sample the new bar menu along with their classic favorites and it was quite a feast! 

They are now offering a BYOB - Build Your Own BBQ. With 3 types of fillings to choose from (pulled pork, beef brisket, or burnt ends), folks can make their own BBQ tacos with a combination of tangy mustard slaw, southwestern rice, chimichurri, pickled sweet onions, and pickles. This is a great option for those who are gluten free since you can create a traditional soft taco or lettuce cup. 

Then there&#39;s the soft tacos on a unique tortilla bread that&#39;s soft, flaky and flavorful, stuffed with either beef or pork. 

Flatbreads are also on the menu and we tried the Hawaiian, made with chopped pork, BBQ sauce, grilled pineapple, green onion and Monterey Jack cheese. My favorite flatbread was the Smoky Bacon Bleu, made with bleu brie white sauce, caramelized onions, hickory bacon and crisp arugula. 

BBQ sliders, also known as BBQ Bites on their menu are also offered, in which we tried both beef and pork. They were great  with lots of flavor and perfect if you have kiddies to order for.

Like most bar menus, buffalo wings are common but here at Famous Dave&#39;s they have &#39;Smokin Bones&#39; which are cut up pork ribs that are tossed in a buffalo sauce and served with blue cheese dressing. Genius and creative twist!

A fun menu item were their pork skins that are served in a bag you can rip open. Lemon wedges are served along side the skins and when lemon juice hits them, they crackle! They were addictive and I couldn&#39;t help but devour it lol.

Vegetarians/vegans are not forgotten as they also offer a really healthy portion of salads,roasted vegetables and house pickle tray.

As for their traditional menu, we had to get the baby back ribs which were perfectly cooked and had a good smoke ring. We also had their steak, which was also perfectly cooked to a medium rare.

We couldn&#39;t pass up on dessert so we had a sampling of their top three desserts - Dave&#39;s Famous Bread Pudding, Down Home Banana Pudding and their Hot Fudge Kahlua Brownie. All of them were amazing with the bread pudding and kahlua brownie being my favorites.

Overall, Famous Dave&#39;s has some great new menu additions and I encourage folks to visit and give them a try! I know I&#39;ll be back..."

My wife had a taste for ribs so she ordered the spareribs vs babyback ribs due to the waitresses suggestion. I ordered the beef brisket which was also recommended by the waitress. Both dinners came with 2 sides. The ribs were tough and dry, a huge disappointment. Her side of mash potatoes was good. My beef brisket was meaty but also was very dry. Coleslaw and  baked beans were delicious and flavorful. My wife does like her ribs where the meat falls off the bone and only ended up eating 2 pieces. I tried the ribs and found them very tough and dry. We were there on Monday, February 9, at about 4:45 pm. There were only a few tables seated. The decor is very nice and the restaurant looks very clean. Men&#39;s bathroom was good. During our dinner there was a lot of loud laughter and conversation but it was not from anyone in the dining room so perhaps it was staff? Manager came by our table to ask how our meal was and we told him about the ribs and he pretty much blew us off saying that smoking vs boiling the ribs makes a rib with more chew. That may be true but why was it so dry? Did not even get a chance to address the brisket as he excused himself and invited us back. When we go out for bbq it is all about the meat and on this day Famous Dave&#39;s fell very short on our expectations. Will we go back?  Probably to most definitely not!"

I have eaten dinner there but this review is for my last experience in the bar. The tacos are to die for. I had the pulled pork and my sister got the brisket. The shell is kind of a thin puffed pastry. The meat was tender. It had a pineapple citrus pico de gallo relish. Then the manager brought over a sample of their new buffalo ribs. These are small bite sized center cut rubs with a wonderful wonderful buffalo sauce. No fat all edible. They have several craft beers now on tap. If you are looking for a happy hour or just a meal, you have to order these in the bar. They have tables and I think the lighting is more relaxing in there. This was on a Friday night and they were also setting up for a small music venue, but I didn&#39;t have to to stay and listen."

First of all, we were not even seated before the waitress was there wanting to take our drink orders. While it was nice to have the speedy service, can you wait until we all sit down? Normally I like to order the appetizer with the drinks (not a requirement, but expected etiquette).

In my last review my only real complaint was the fact that I had to get out of my seat to get my own sauces. When I saw that there were 2 sauces on the table this time my first thought was, &#34;ok this is a nice change&#34;. NOT! My favorite sauce, the exceptionally tasty and hot Wilber sauce, was no longer offered. What???? So instead the server offered to bring the LESS TASTY and less hot Devil&#39;s Spit. Strike One.

On to the meal. I ordered the Nachos for an appetizer. Stale chips and a less than impressive topping that consisted of mostly lettuce, a few beans, even less meat and their Sweet and Tangy sauce. Blah. I couldn&#39;t even eat most of it. Just horrible.

My son ordered a grilled chicken sandwich that didn&#39;t seem too grilled. It presented nicely but he tells me it was very bland (and this kid likes everything). The only thing he seemed to enjoy was the fries.

I ordered the Rib &amp; Rib because I can never seem make up mind on just one item and this looked like it would satisfy. NOT! Last review I thoroughly enjoyed the St Louis ribs, so I went with that and the Baby backs. Oh boy, quality really went downhill. Both 1/2 slabs were dry and tasteless (I really missed that Wilber Sauce just then).  I also went with the green beans that I raved about last time. What 3 months ago were cooked to perfection were now a soggy cold mess of flavorless torture. So sad. The garlic mashed had the consistency of clay and the taste of...well I am too nice to say what excrement they tasted like. Also cold. 

To top off our disappointing meal, when it was time for the check, I was left wondering what happened to that speedy server we had. During the eternal wait, I witnessed the manager (who looked like he needed to invest in an iron) greet several customers. I was so hoping he would come to my table and ask about our meal, to no avail. He must have seen the utterly exasperated look on my face and high tailed it out of there. Still waiting for my check (about 10 minutes now) , a different server seemed to be working our area. I attempted to make the, &#34;I&#39;m ready for my check, where is my server&#34; look at her each of the several times that I saw her in the area, but no luck. Finally, after I just could not wait any longer, I stood up and proceeded to hunt down my server. Guess what? That server I kept giving &#34;the eye&#34; asked if I needed something. I said of course, &#34;I&#39;d just  like my check, please&#34;. Before I could sit back down she brought it out. I couldn&#39;t help to notice the lovely tattoo on her upper arm that her short sleeves did nothing for. Don&#39;t get me wrong I don&#39;t mind tattoos as long as the service makes up for the lack of professionalism. 

End result, I won&#39;t be returning to Famous Dave&#39;s.

On a side note I did some research and discovered that famous Dave&#39;s has a new CEO, Ed Rensi. He is a former top executive from McDonald&#39;s and took over earlier this year in an attempt to turn around the sluggish company. I am thinking that&#39;s not working out so well. Too bad, I really like their pickles."

The hustle and bustle of Ikea just across the parking lot, makes for a hungry afternoon. Its incredible how one can work up an appetite right after shopping. But it has happened. 

The lunch specials and prices were really on point. It turns out that the portions are not that bad either. Of course, beef brisket is usually always made right, after all how can you really mess that up. Although the side of mashed potatoes did not quite make it, just a bit too wet for my taste. But the corn bread and corn was just right. Now the pork pieces had more cartilage than one would really care to eat, but I digress. All in all it was a good experience and the fact that the Manager actually came by three times to see if everything was okay was nice also. Although our waitress felt that speaking to the family behind us (I think they are regulars), was much more important than taking orders, I was happy due to the fact that she was attentive with us. Good thing for her."

Perhaps I am getting cranky in my old age. We didn&#39;t even get the sauce explaination...and I thought that was standard fare. Perhaps they don&#39;t do that at this location. We normally go to the Yorktown location but were headed out this way so we tried it out. Inside it is pretty cool. No literally, the AC was workin&#39; overtime as we were freezing.

Friday night 4 of us ventured to the Bolingbrook location of Famous Dave&#39;s (sadly the Naperville location shut down) and had a great meal and a great time.  I got the half slab and a meat side, it came with fries, corn bread and mac &amp; cheese.  Food was excellent, service was good, beer was cold and a good time was had by all.  The best part about going was it wasn&#39;t the rib fest, we sat at a table, the food was brought to us, we didn&#39;t have to stand in an hour long line, it was air conditioned, there were no bugs and I wasn&#39;t bumping into people.  The other nice thing was that an entire meal at Famous Dave&#39;s was only slightly more than the entrance fee to rib fest (which doesn&#39;t include anything).

I always leave so stuffed that I need someone to practically carry be out of there.  

I like this place because I don&#39;t have to dress up...I can just show up however I want.  The decor is fun.  They have all of these lights draped above the tables and it is a magical and finger-licking experience.  

They have tiny desserts which are just right...because you know how you always want to try the dessert, but never have the room.  

The service has always been top notch.  I didn&#39;t like how spicy something was (I am a whimp when it comes to spice sometimes)  and they remade my food with a much more satisfying sauce without any difficulty.

Not small, but TINY- embarrassingly TINY food.  I ordered a BBQ pork sandwich with a side of mac/cheese.  The sandwich was like 2.5&#34; square with about 3 bites of Mac/cheese (which is extremely cheap to make).  How you stay in business where surrounding establishments serve much bigger portions for the same price is beyond me.   It was really like a joke how TINY the food was.

First time for my boyfriend. Very delicious! We have both eaten plenty of bbq in Memphis,  Kansas City, and North Carolina, which is the best. But for a chain this is still good bbq. Our waitress Julie was a great server. Service was great for a Friday night. Manager asked us how dinner was and asked my BF what his favorite sauce was since it was his first time there. When the check came the manager gave us a complementary bottle of the sauce we liked.  We will definitely be back for the food and the service!"

The first time I went there, I was very impressed by the &#34;Baby Back Ribs.&#34; They were very tender and the original barbeque sauce they use is really good.  There Mai Tai&#39;s are nicely prepared too.  I really liked the service too.  I was a new customer and even the manager came out to welcome us and they gave us tons of useful coupons and even a free barbeque sauce.  However, I went there yesterday and as soon as they brought out my ribs, I asked the waitress if she was sure those were &#34;Baby Back Ribs?&#34; I instantly could tell that they looked completely different then when I first tried them a few weeks back.  I wanted to give them a chance and I knew right away after trying to cut through them that the meat was not very tender and had a rough texture.  I only ate the top of the ribs, and was not happy with the quality of the ribs this time.  I should have said something to the waitress,but I didn&#39;t want to sound like a snob since it is a barbeque place, and I did use two fo the coupons.  I&#39;m not sure if I will go back there. I felt that the waitress should have shown more &#34;concern&#34; or at least inquired why I asked if my ribs were even &#34;Baby Back Ribs.&#34; I was smiling when I asked either.  &#34;Hint, hint.&#34; lol 
The bread pudding is pretty good, but very sweet.  The potato salad is not good, I was also dissapointed in ordering that as one of my two sides:-(  
The corn bread is very good, and so is the corn on the cob."

My husband usually orders the brisket - and I usually order the baby back ribs with the Memphis Dry Rub.   Sometimes his brisket is good - sometimes it&#39;s kind of dry.   Sometimes my ribs are great - sometimes they aren&#39;t (like when we were there last Friday).  My ribs were very tough and &#34;crunchy&#34;.  They were overcooked - but it seemed like they were cooked too fast - versus being slowly smoked.  Other times - the ribs have been very good.  I&#39;m not sure why the quality varies so much.

In an effort to not be &#34;that guy&#34; who sits at a table by himself, I opted to sit at a bar.  This was a mistake. Since the hostest was AWOL, I was unable to let anyone know I was sitting at the bar when I first got there. No one noticed I was there until I flagged someone down. Once I flagged someone down, they made it seem like I was another server&#39;s problem. One of the servers from the dining room had to maintain the bar and her dining room tables while I was there.  This made the service incredibly slow. I ordered the Southside Rib Tips and they were delicious.   Word of advice: sit in the dining room, even if you are by yourself."

The food was very good and so were the many BBQ sauce offerings.  The service was outstanding (I believe our waiter was Kyle).  We were given complimentary seasoned chips to sample the BBQ sauces, the waiter was very attentive throughout, and the manager also visited our table twice and asked for feedback on the food and service.  Nice touch!  One of our guests had a taste for bacon and asked if he could order a plate-full even though it was not on the menu (why would it be?).  They cooked him up a special order at a more than reasonable price.  Finally, upon leaving, our bacon boy was offered a bottle of his favorite BBQ sauce and given some coupons for future visits since it was his first visit at Famous Dave&#39;s.

I got the Texas Manhandler sandwich (to go) w/ a side of fries... half the &#34;sandwich&#34; was actually 3 fries they snuck under the bun.  The brisket had hardly any sauce on it, which was a problem considering the fact that the sausage was cheap, rubbery, and dry.  The &#34;Hell-Fire&#34; pickles were bland as hell; seriously, plain Heinz pickle relish probably has more zip to it.  Finally, the fries were cold and soggy, but I guess that&#39;s my own fault since I live about 15 mins away.

It was all so bad that I&#39;d consider calling up the manager to complain (especially since they jipped me by stuffing fries into my sandwich) and maybe get a free meal out of it, but I&#39;m sure that would suck, too.

I gave it 1 star because the bun was fresh."

They are available for sale there as well. There are like 4-5 squirt bottles to chose from on the table. They also have a roll of paper towel on a roll holder on the table- which is very smart when eating barbeque! I always get the Texas Beef Brisket, it is very lean and yummy!

Food: 4/5
The Sweet 16 was delicious! It&#39;s definitely a must try! The Chicago Roll was also great! I wasn&#39;t a fan of the Volcano Roll. It had a strange texture that my taste buds didn&#39;t agree with. All in all, they have a nice assortment of sushi and roll options. Like all AYCE restaurants, it&#39;s an order all you want but eat all you order establishment.

Customer Service: 1/5
When I arrived at the restaurant, no one was in the front to greet us. We waited 10 minutes before I walked into the seating area to ask a server if I should seat myself. She told me to head back to the front and that someone would be with me shortly. We were seated a few minutes after.

After being seated, we quickly filled out the AYCE form because we were really hungry, but no one came to pick it up for another 10 minutes or so. After our server grabbed it, we waited another 30 minutes for food. When I asked the server if she knew how long it would be before our food came out, she stared at me and walked away. Maybe there was a language barrier? 

She never checked up on us, and it was a hassle to get her attention for my friend to order a second round."

Every time we go in for their 21$ all you can eat sushi the same 3 women that work there ALWAYS forget the extra teriyaki sauce and then take 10 minutes to return with it. (Which means I wait that long to eat). Even if the place isn&#39;t busy. They also don&#39;t always bring out everyone&#39;s food at the same time... Sometimes the time difference is vast. If you can stand shitty customer service, the food is delicious and worth the price. 

Tip: Avoid going on holidays all together. On Mother&#39;s Day, one person waited for their food for over 35 minutes after the rest of us received theirs and another person asked for chop sticks 3-4 times over 25 minutes and never got them, so he grabbed his own."

The sushi presentation was great and fresh; it wasn&#39;t sloppy like other sushi place that I had been in. 

The miso soup was really tasty and not salty or bland, balanced taste, my only thing about the appetizer was that they don&#39;t offer steamed shumai, I love shumai but didn&#39;t like it fried. I dislikes the &#34;Sweet 16 Roll&#34;, the peppers just didn&#39;t belong on a sushi, just not my cup of tea. The fish had thicker cuts and it&#39;s overwhelming on my palette.

drink order:

Sapporo ($3.50)
A-OK, but it was brought in a massive beer stein. Massive as in, capable of holding more than 24oz. The entire bottle&#39;s worth reached only the halfway point. Funny and awkward.


sushi Dinner menu:
MAKi:

Sweet 16: So yum! 5/5
Loved this! The pepper crusted tuna was. the. best. idea. ever. Get it!!1!

Green Turtle: 4.5/5
Really good, especially with the beautiful red tobiko on top!

Spicy Tuna: 4/5
Really good filling-to-rice ratio, but seriously lacking the &#34;spicy.&#34; I didn&#39;t get ANY heat. Not a bit. (Wasabi to the rescue!)

Hokkai: 3.5/5
The roll is fried, which is kind of cool. As such, it&#39;s warm and the insides are soft and melty. If you&#39;ve never had hot/cooked sushi, it can be a bit startling. Meh.



NiGiRi:

First of all, all of the nigiri had a good fish-to-rice ratio! Awesome, because I hate eating giant bricks o&#39;rice!

&#34;White tuna&#34; (Escolar): 5/5
 It&#39;s fatty and oily and so deeeeelicious! Just, erm, don&#39;t eat too much. (Srsly, Google it. You&#39;re welcome.)

Red clam: 4/5
Largest pieces of red clam I&#39;ve ever had. Pretty darn good!

Mackerel: 5/5
They have the moistest mackerel I&#39;ve ever had. Every other AYCE joint I&#39;ve tried prior to Hokkai has awful dry, fishy mackerel. Not here!


Extra bonus: very close to work.
I think I&#39;ve found my new AYCE joint and I&#39;m excited to go back!"

Don&#39;t get me wrong, if I feel like eating lots of nigiri without breaking my wallet, this is currently my restuarant of choice. But aside from that, most of the sushi rolls here for me are just too boring as far as flavor combinations go. Maybe this is ultimately becuase I started going to better quality sushi restuarants in the Chicago suburban area like Chiba and Chef Soon as well as making my own sushi more often within the past year.

I mean this place from what I&#39;ve gathered isn&#39;t too cheap on using good quality ingredients in their sushi, so could it really hurt for them to get more creative than simply having rolls that are just practically a shrimp tempura roll with just different sauce/ toppings over them? Maybe introduce a torched roll (shrimp tempura and cucumber inside with salmon and white tuna drizzled with eel sauce and spicy mayo then torched) to the AYCE menu? Or maybe put in just one really good roll with mostly raw ingredients like tuna, yellowtail, cucumber, avocado, jalapeno, and cilantro on the AYCE menu as well? These additions (or something very similar) will TOTALLY GET HOKKAI TO ANOTHER LEVEL OF AWESOMENESS! 

I like shrimp tempura rolls, but it&#39;s kinda of a bummer when most of the rolls here are primarily just shrimp tempura rolls that are slightly changed around a bit for each roll. Until the restaurant gets more creative with its sushi rolls aside from the Angry Dragon and Sweet 16 rolls, I&#39;d have give this place barely a 4/5 (a whole star down from my original review of this place); Hokkai&#39;s a great to eat a lot of nigiri or introduce someone into sushi without paying a lot, but the lack of flavorful rolls outside the &#34;reskinned versions&#34; of the shrimp tempura roll in its AYCE menu really hurt."

The parking lot can be a little bonkers due to its proximity to TJ&#39;s (and being on Roosevelt Rd) but that just means you have to be extra careful backing out.

They don&#39;t put tons of rice in the AYCE sushi or rolls. That&#39;s great! And the fish is fresh and tasty. I tried the Paradise Roll with banana tempura as my dessert. It was interesting with the sweet of the banana and the crunchy tempura and shrimp tempura. I&#39;ve taken my mom--a &#34;I don&#39;t like sushi&#34; person--here, and she&#39;s ready to try more than the sweet potato and California rolls. She&#39;s ready to try the Rainbow roll next.

The restaurant is deceptively large, given its hole-in-the-wall-looking storefront. You step inside and immediately see a bar area which obscures a much larger dining area with booths, tables, and even another elevated dining region.

Their menu is almost entirely sushi, sashimi, or maki rolls. The roll selection is as diverse as you can as for but, other than gyoza or teriyaki, sushi is pretty much all they offer. This is fine because if you&#39;re looking to engorge yourself in sushi, Hokkai is the place to go. Their all-you-can-eat sushi lunch is $16. So if you&#39;re willing to starve yourself through breakfast time and can put down a lot of maki rolls, this is your spot. The food quality is just alright but, for a place that clearly rests its laurels on quantity, what else can you expect?

If you&#39;re hungry midway through the work day and like sushi, Hokkai should definitely be in your rotation."

We were seated promptly without a reservation. We got our order sheets and started to decode some things on the menu. After seeing what some of our table neighbors got we went ahead and grabbed a few appetizers, some sushi and some rolls. 

Appetizers: Crab rangoon - light, crunchy breading with a great rangoon filling and dipping sauce
Fried scallops - these were little nuggets of heavenly goodness
Dumplings - fried and oh so good

Rolls and sushi - I cannot break this down into individual entries because of the shear volume of things I consumed that evening. All I will say is that out of the 40 or so things we tried every single one of them was awesome. 

All in all I cannot wait to come back to this place.....after my stomach recovers. 

Cons: not BYOB"

I love AYCE sushi!! 

The restaurant is bigger inside and has a nicer interior than i anticipated... a complete surprise. It is in a strip mall next to a hair salon and a small clothing boutique. Goes to show don&#39;t judge a book by its cover. 

Hokkai has a $15.99 AYCE lunch menu, and a $20.99 AYCE dinner menu. Although I was going in for lunch, I asked if I could order off the dinner menu, they said it was fine. The rest of my group ordered off the lunch menu. The dinner menu is more robust, it includes apps such a seaweed salad and shrimp tempura. It also has more rolls that I wanted to order. And it had regular tuna sushi (piece of fish atop a small ball of rice), as opposed to white tuna sushi on the lunch menu. 

I started with seaweed salad, shrimp tempura, and scallop tempura. All were good.

I ordered shrimp tempura, sweet potato, Hokkai, Rainbow, and Sweet 16 rolls. Hokkai was my favorite, the sweet potato my least fav. 

I did not see any dessert options on the menu, and frankly, was too stuffed to ask. 

The two reasons I&#39;m giving Hokkai 3 stars instead of 4 is because:

1. They have no sashimi offerings on either lunch or dinner AYCE menus. 

2. The service was spotty. The servers would all be standing around near the back, and multiple times I would make eye contact with one, she&#39;d look right back at me, I&#39;d wave, she&#39;d look away, and another server would then head towards my table. I just found that kind of odd and inconsiderate. 

Otherwise, Hokkai is a solid choice for sushi in the Lombard/Glen Ellyn area."

I went with my husband for my birthday dinner.  We were really surprised by the variety and freshness available on the ACYE menu for a really reasonable price (20.99 pp).  We had a ton of stuff and everything was really delicious.  We ordered the fried scallops and they had obviously been cooked to order because they were almost too hot to eat.  The staff weren&#39;t overly friendly, but they were definitely efficient.  The food came out so quickly.  I was a little worried about going to a &#34;sushi buffet&#34; because if the turnover isn&#39;t good, you could end up with some seriously bad sushi (and potentially some seriously bad stomach issues), but this place has you order what you want, they make it then and bring it to you directly.

I can&#39;t really imagine going to any other sushi place in the area, now.  I personally think that most of the Chicago suburbs are a decent, sushi desert (with the exception of maybe a few places in the Arlington Heights area). I&#39;m sure if I went to the city, we could go to some sort of super fancy &#34;authentic&#34; sushi place and have extremely expensive sushi, but usually, I just want a few simple things like good spicy tuna or a yellowtail avocado roll and I don&#39;t want it to cost me my entire restaurant budget for the month.  Hokkai definitely delivers.  I will DEFINITELY be back. And I will tell all of my friends about it, too.

Also, the restaurant is very nicely decorated and clean!  I was totally impressed."

Throughout the years of eating out , I&#39;ve limited my dining experience at buffets/all you can eats,  as I&#39;ve had my fair share of bad experiences at even the best of the best buffets/ all you can eat venues. For the price ($19.99) you can&#39;t go wrong with the all you can eat quality of sushi offered. 

You are provided a checklist where you check off the item ( appetizers, sashimi, and sushi rolls) &amp; provide the quantity you would like. Make sure you don&#39;t go over board &amp; order everything off the menu  (unless you are able to eat every thing clean), otherwise there is a fee charged to ensure the business is not coming out with a loss of food / placing a dent in their pocket.

I usually go with a 2-3 others and we usually end up ordering 4-5 appetizers and save room to order at least two rounds of sushi (usually 7-8 rolls) each round . Each roll comes in 7-8 pieces &amp; are packed with the fish selection / sushi contents (they don&#39;t jip you here). 

Quality is amazing , I&#39;ve had no complaints thus far with any &#34;fishiness&#34; or quality complaints. Everything looks fresh enough to keep ordering more. I highly recommend the &#34;sweet 16&#34;, &#34;Rainbow&#34;, and &#34;Under Control&#34; Rolls , my favorite.

Fair to say everything on the all you can eat menu is fair game &amp; just as good as the rest. If you are a sushi lover (like myself) and have eaten sushi all over , try Hokkai &amp; see for yourself ."

We also enjoyed the Spicy Tuna, Sweet Potato and Salmon rolls.  We tried the Spider roll as well but it had too much going on for our taste.

Shall I say Tada, I present to you Hokkai&#39;s AYCE sushi lunch menu special for $15.99! At first I wanted to select everything on the menu from &#34;Miso&#34; to &#34;Rock &amp; Roll!&#34; Then my inner mind trumped my growling tummy. 

So by process of elimination, my inner explorer decided to have items on the menu that I either could not pronounce or have never had before.

I saw Marumaki? What is that? So I ever so eagerly marked one on that appetizer as I &#34;Googled&#34; it as I awaited it&#39;s arrival to my palette. Online research states that it is a Chinese inspired &#34;spring roll.&#34; The Chinese introduced it to Japan during migration and the Japanese customized it by adding country inspired ingredients. Maru meaning Spring and that this was a food eaten that season and &#34;maki&#34; means roll. Hence any &#34;Maki&#34; is rolled sushi.

I added my favorite salmon sushi and a yellowtail jalepeno roll. Both with fresh flavor and I like the underestimated rice. 

Finishing off, I wanted eel. Who doesn&#39;t love a little &#34;ponzu&#34; sauce. Aha, at the bottom of the AYCE menu I was &#34;Rock &amp; Rolling!&#34; I then pushed my adventurous limits and added on a &#34;Rainbow Roll,&#34; which had salmon, white tuna, avocado and more! I think I have a pretty colorful day so far!

Now time to work off my lunch if I can get myself to &#34;roll&#34; to Trader Joe&#39;s which is right next door for some groceries. 

All I have to say is &#34;Hokkai&#34; is a place to try!"

The apps were fresh and crispy. I had tempura scallops and shrimp, and they were high quality. The seaweed salad was fresh and flavorful.

Even the fountain soda was worthy of a good comment because if you&#39;ve ever had soda made with bad water, you&#39;d appreciate the crisp clean taste of their Pepsi. 

There are many rolls to choose from. I had four, and they were all good. The rainbow roll was incredible. I would skip the volcano roll next time. Too &#34;American&#34;.  Heavy on the mayo and other sauce.
Then I tried only three pieces of sushi because I was stuffed. Eel, octopus, and white tuna. Loved the eel, liked the octopus, the tuna was OK. I think I just got an edge or something because my tuna piece had one tiny edge of hard flesh. 

Overall, whether you&#39;re a veteran or brand new to Japanese cuisine, this is a winner!"

I did not go back to check out ladies room. Sooo here goes... we were looking for a sushi place to take our kids and the reviews on this place looked good. Please note-if you have any non sushi peeps there are not a lot of options.  Hubby and superboy #1 had Sushi and Superboy #2 and I had teriyaki chicken. Reports on sushi were pretty good-not the best but not the worst. It was Friday night so after initial order there was some significant waiting on additional rolls. Chicken teriyaki looked good but had no taste. A case of frozen chicken breast covered in teriyaki. The presentation gave me high hopes-some broccoli on the side and served on a bed of sautéed zucchini. I literally took one bite of chicken and was knew I&#39;d not be enjoying my entree. I get it-it&#39;s a sushi place! After sushi eaters tried chicken to see &#34;how bad it really was&#34; we decided it wasn&#39;t bad. It just wasn&#39;t good. At all. Sushi eaters stayed for one last roll (before they hit the bathroom) and boy #2 and I left our untouched food to hit Traders Joes next store. Where my hubby met us to say it felt cleaner NOT to wash his hands and leave the bathroom at restaurant as quickly as possible. 

One star for decent sushi at a good price. One star because I hate to ruin a place&#39;s rep for what might be a bad night. Before you order I&#39;d check out the restrooms and decide if you want to stay!"

The restaurant closes at 10 pm and we arrived about 9:20. They gracefully allowed us in and showed us to our table. They then notified us that we had 10 min to order. We quickly ordered a few rolls (we were a table of 5). As soon as we ordered, we noticed the staff turn off ALL the lights. We were left in the dark and asked the waitress if she can kindly turn on the light as we haven&#39;t even gotten our food yet. She declined, saying they were closing at 10. It was nowhere close to 10! Our food arrived quickly by 9:40ish and looked amazing. We began eating only to be told numerous times that they&#39;re closing in a few min. We ate with all eyes on us, as all the staff awaited for us to finish eating. At 9:50 we were told we needed to get going. WHAT?! How dare they attempt to kick us out of the restaurant that they joyfully greeted us into. It seemed as though as soon as they gave us the sushi, they wanted us gone. I understand we were the last ones there, but that is simply unacceptable. We were unable to finish our food, nor could we attempt to enjoy our time. By 9:55, they came to us and said they will give us boxes free of charge (as if that&#39;s someone good that they&#39;re offering us). They literally escorted us out before 10 pm. Needless to say, we will not be returning. 

If you allow a customer to come in and dine, the least you can do is wait till the customer is finished eating before escorting them out and stating that the restaurant is closed. 

We voiced our concerns to the team and their reply was &#34;we are overworked and tired. We just want to go home&#34;. Unacceptable. Avoid if you&#39;re expecting decent customer service."

Sadly she doesn&#39;t like fish, but I guess more for me! She had a chicken teriyaki and liked it.
I had sushi 3 plates of it ! I ordered a little less each time, my last one was just three pieces, but still...
Great deal, great food, great service"

I was pleasantly surprised by the quantity of rolls given for the price! The seaweed salad is very good. Our waitress was kind enough to go thru entire roll menu, stating which rolls were cooked and which contained shellfish. The Hokkai roll was my favorite! Looks are deceiving when you pull up to this place- the atmosphere inside is nice for a date night and there is plenty of parking. Don&#39;t forget to tip accordingly when you have the AYCE...you definitely get your money&#39;s worth and more!"

For $20.99 at dinner time, Hokkai&#39;s AYCE features soup, salad, appetizers, nigiri, and an assortment of maybe 15-20 rolls.

Chances are, you&#39;ve had Gyoza before, right?  And it usually tastes the same, sometimes it&#39;s a little suspect that it was a frozen product.  Not at Hokkai - this was some of the best gyoza on earth.  It wasn&#39;t too chewy or over-fried.  We ended up sharing 2 portions of these.

We also shared 4 different types of rolls:

Under Control:  Spicy tuna and shrimp tempura, this was the favorite, and we repeated this roll in round 2.

Rainbow:  Super fresh fish on top of a California roll.  You can&#39;t go wrong here.

Volcano Roll:  Spicy tuna with spicy mayo and some other spiciness, it was full of flavor but needed something else for texture.  It was a bit too soft and mushy for us.

Sweet Potato:  The only other sweet potato roll I&#39;ve had was deep fried, but this was not.  I wasn&#39;t a fan of how firm/undercooked the sweet potato was.

Yellowtail Avocado:  Fresh, but a little bit &#34;blah.&#34;

Hokkai is nicer inside than many strip mall sushi restaurants.  It has a trendy feel with the dark furniture, and the neon green and blue lighting up the walls.  The music didn&#39;t match the vibe though, it was instrumental elevator music, but if they played some danceable pop tunes it would better match the decor and probably attract a younger, more hip, crowd.

Hokkai isn&#39;t my favorite AYCE sushi in the suburbs, but it still stands on its own."

I was in the area during lunch time so I ate off of their lunch AYCE menu.  I think it may have been because I was eating lunch and not dinner that I didn&#39;t have my socks blown off.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, the sushi was good.  It was fresh, the pieces were good sizes, etc.  However, the lunch menu for me was a little vanilla.  

In reading other Yelper&#39;s reviews it sounds like dinner is the way to go here.  I am going to have to make a point to come out to dinner here and try some of the Gyoza that Angela P is raving about - who doesn&#39;t like a dumpling?  It sounds like they have more variety available during dinner too.  I will say in looking at their regular menu, it looks like they have a great deal of options if you ordered that way as well."

Sushi came out all pretty, resting on ice &amp; all sorts of cute flashy things. The salad that came out was simply iceberg lettuce with shaved carrots &amp; dressing. It was a disappointment. Twister roll was tasty, but first thing I noticed was the aged avocado-- it&#39;s sides were browning. The sushi was tasty, it was just odd to me how the tuna &amp; salmon sashimi were so loose-- it looked like it could shred as I held it up with my chopsticks. (Like tender fall-off-the-bone ribs) It&#39;s a pretty sushi place but the food (although good) wasn&#39;t fantastic enough for me to give it the full 5 stars. Giving Hokkai a 4 is pretty generous based on my first experience, but I would come here again. (2nd time I tried Hokkai, I got it to go, sushi held together better, skipped the salad, avocado wasn&#39;t brown. Yay.)"

A friend and I stopped in on a Saturday evening around seven. It was busy, but service was prompt and attentive, and the food was good. The menu does have some cooked options but I would suggest coming here for the sushi. They have a fairly classic option of maki rolls and sashimi options. If you&#39;re looking for  a true take on the classics, Hokkai can definitely meet your needs. However, I also found the specialty roll options to be inventive, thoughtfully put together, and delicious. All in all, I&#39;d love to go back and try out more of their menu. I was very pleased.

A few notes: There is ample parking, but in proximity to so many other stores (and off Roosevelt) it was a bit tight for us. They do have a take-out option, and it&#39;s a bummer I&#39;m not in the area more often: I&#39;d definitely make use of it."

I came during dinner hours and was greeted very nicely by the staff. The waiting staff were all very friendly with me and respectful. The AYCE sushi menu is extensive and you won&#39;t be disappointed. The service was very quick, quicker than I expected to be honest but that&#39;s great! The fish was very fresh and the sushi was well made and at the correct portions. 

I ordered my favs: salmon sushi, eel sushi, and tuna sushi. I also ordered some of the rolls, which were all very tasty. I wanted to order again and again, I was hungry for more! The only reason why I didn&#39;t order more was because I was afraid that I wouldn&#39;t be able to finish it.

With the negative stigma attached to an &#34;all-you-can-eat sushi buffet&#34;, I was hesitant to give this place a try, until finally, my friends convinced me to try it with them.

Well, long story short, this is the only sushi place I will go to. Sushi rolls can be expensive, and often it takes more than $20 worth of rolls to actually get full. This place uses super fresh fish, is extremely clean, and has a huge variety of delicious sushi.  And the price? $20.99 for dinner where you can order as many appetizers and sushi rolls as you like! Just be sure to finish all that you order or else you will get charged a fee. I&#39;ve been here at least 10 times and have never had a bad experience.

FOOD: The sushi is so fresh. My favorite item is the salmon nigiri. It&#39;s so pink and you can taste the freshness. The white tuna and unagi nigiri are also so good. All their rolls are delicious. Many different combinations. There are many different kinds of shrimp tempura rolls (which is what won over my fiancé). But the best thing about this place is that they don&#39;t over do it with the rice. Most AYCE sushi places will load up the rice. But not at Hokkai. They put a thin layer so you can actually taste the fish and fillings, not just rice.

SERVICE: service is always friendly and fast. Food always comes out pretty quick and is always fresh.

This is totally a thing here in the burbs and it&#39;s working out pretty well for us.  Usually a random sign placed somewhere that reads &#34;SUSHI&#34;.  We wander in, get good treatment and decent food.  That basically sums up this visit.

A few of my favorite fellow Yelpers have written reviews here this year and while trying to decide where to eat a couple weeks ago, I stumbled across this spot.  We headed over and found that the restaurant was located in the same strip mall as Trader Joe&#39;s.  On a Sunday, this meant a bustling parking lot with minimal availability.  We worked it out and went inside.  

No one was there.  I didn&#39;t panic because I have faith in what my friends say, so we sat right at the bar and ordered it up.  The waitress was friendly and the first round arrived pretty quickly.  It was very good.  Nothing stuck out as amazing, but it was good.  Round two, I get creative and decide to try something unknown to me.  The hubby makes sure to try most of his favorites and we are rounding the bend toward home... Uh oh... I&#39;m stuffed.  I realize there was something about an additional charge if I don&#39;t clear my plate.  I&#39;ve got half a roll left and I just can&#39;t muster up the chewing power or tummy space for these last gargantuan three bites.  So, I pick one piece apart and get it down.  I called it quits.  My hubby just laughs at me for ordering such a large roll and he won&#39;t help because he&#39;s stuffed to the brim.  Unfortunately for me, AYCE here means that if I don&#39;t finish a roll, they will charge the AYCE price plus the FULL cost of that roll.  No way Jose!  Give me another Sprite and go away.  I&#39;ve got this!  And so with all the chewing power I could muster and every last inch of my digestional being, I ate those last two bites.  I was dying.  No more pleasantries from me.  Just roll me to Trader Joe&#39;s, so I can walk some of this off.

So lunch on Sunday is actually served at the dinner price.  We didn&#39;t realize that until the bill arrived, but it was still reasonable.  It&#39;s a nice little spot with good service, good sushi and some nice options.  The décor was slightly odd and kinda made me feel like I was dining underwater with lots of reflective type materials used throughout.  They are very firm on the finish it or we will charge you full price for whatever you don&#39;t finish rule.  I wasn&#39;t a fan of that since been spoiled at other spots who charge an extra two dollars if I don&#39;t get those last two bites down."

The only reason I was hesitant to try it is because normally when a sushi restaurant has the all you can eat special it is too good to be true. I&#39;m a sushi snob. I don&#39;t like eating outside of my normal sushi places because it can be hit or miss, however this place was definitely a HIT! We got here around 5 o&#39;clock on a Monday evening. The place was pretty empty, but not for long. Shortly after we got there the back room filled up. The restaurant smelled good and was exceptionally clean. 

We ordered probably 7 different rolls off the all you can eat menu for $20.95. The rolls were so fresh, had a lot of flavor and the combinations they use definitely complimented each other. The ratio of rice and fish couldn&#39;t have been any better. They are definitely generous with the fish and toppings! The presentation was very appealing. The batter on the shrimp tempura was PERFECT! Crunchy, hot and awesome flavor. Our favorite roll was definitely the Angry roll. We got regular sushi as well. The yellow tail and white tuna was so fresh and the amount of fish definitely outweighed the amount of rice and was so enjoyable. The miso soup was tasty and the green tea was amazing! I&#39;m pretty sure they use the Brown rice, green tea here so it was definitely more than satisfying. 

If I&#39;m ever back in this area I will be sure to come back to this place. The locals here are so lucky to have such an amazing sushi place around!! I would recommend anyone who loves sushi or high maintenance with sushi to come to Hokkai. You won&#39;t be disappointed!"

If I could give Hokkai six stars, I would. I&#39;ve been to at least fifty Japanese/sushi joints, and Hokkai was hands down the best sushi I&#39;ve ever had. We arrived around 5:45 pm on a Wednesday evening for a casual birthday dinner. The place was empty and silent but completely stunning. The owners definitely invested in the decor and remodel. Don&#39;t let the exterior of the building fool you. 

Service was an A+. We were cheerfully greeted by every employee of the restaurant upon arrival. Our water glasses were always full and our server was beyond helpful.

We ordered the Angel Roll, Twister, Rainbow Roll, Spicy Tuna, and Spicy Salmon. The presentation was incredible. The other reviewers are indeed correct; each and every roll was boasting an enormous amount of fresh fish and very little rice. Freshest fish I&#39;ve ever tasted. It was just such an overwhelmingly enjoyable dining experience I still can&#39;t get over it, twenty-four hours later. I couldn&#39;t pick a favorite roll because they were all so amazing. Yes, even the simple $5 rolls, which I tend to shy away from. Oh, and the prices? Incredibly modest. 

I cannot say better things about Hokkai. I can&#39;t wait to go again!"

Perhaps I have just been to more expensive, fancier sushi joints before? Normally, I would say so, but Sushi Ya in Schaumburg is a tiny place and blows Hokkai Sushi out of the ballpark for quality and flavor with their sushi!! 

This place has some nice decor and definitely makes the effort to present their roles in a fancy, appetizing way, so kudos for that, but the actual taste of the sushi was just plain and bland. We got the Twister Roll, Sweet 16, Tempura Shrimp roll, and Yellowtail Jalapeno roll. Some of those have a lot of sauces on them, yet they had no taste! How is that possible? My boyfriend took a few bites and basically told me he would rather buy a burger on the way home than order more sushi there.

I think the sushi at MoonSun in Glendale Heights is also better than this place. Not by much, but at least there is definite flavor there. Hokkai wasabi was bland as well, you had to use gobs of it to get any spice added to you rolls.

Just 100% underwhelmed by this place. Yelp, you let me down! For 4.5 stars, I expected FAR BETTER SUSHI. If you are the person looking for cheap sushi (they have very small all you can eat lunch menu for $15) then perhaps this place is for you. However, if you are looking for something that tastes stellar and is true quality, look elsewhere. Sushi Ya is a good place to start..."

Just kidding... I could only wish my lifestyle were sushi diet/mercury poisoning luxurious. I just saved up my to-do list of sushi joints to review all in a row so I&#39;d look really fancy to people who don&#39;t know me, or only read the first two lines of this review... which I suspect to be  in the realm of about 99.5% of people who attempt to read any portion of anything I write.  

I was in town for just a few days and had a very short but incredibly important list of priorities:

1. Get hair done at Niki Moon
2. Have breakfast with Rick Bayless (name drop alert) and my Dad
3. Go to Riot Fest for the Flaming Lips with Danny W
4. Brunch with my favorite friend couple, Petar &amp; Mandy
5. Get some quality AYCE sushi time in with the one and only Andres D... 

It&#39;s been Andres and my practically weekly tradition for years now and Dre is one of my most favorite people of all time so having recently moved across the country, we were long overdue for some sea-life grubbin: Enter Hokkai. 

I&#39;d been wanting to come here ever since I got the 411 about this tucked away tiny gem in NOT-downtown Glen Ellyn from my lady, Laura C, and the time had finally come to give it a shot. 

I think we arrived around 2/2:30, so we were able to take part in all the All You Can Eat fabulous-ness and we started off like any other meal we share together, because we basically lunch Groundhog Day style and by now we know exactly what the other is going to want and say every time, so decisions are really easy. 

I really liked Hokkai&#39;s lunch AYCE menu because it allowed us to stick with our tradition where we start off with a perverted joke about someone we know and then I put in a double order of green tea and miso soup for the both of us, then once the ordering is done and I&#39;m so full I have to take my belt off I tell Andres my plan to disassemble the leftover sushi that we&#39;re too full to eat and I&#39;ll throw some of it under the table so it looks like we ate it/that someone else&#39;s kid was just a messy eater and that way we don&#39;t have to pay full price for the last 3 wasted pieces, then Andres sternly tells me &#39;no&#39; and that I should go to the bathroom to make more room, then we suck up the pain while he eats the last two out of three pieces and I choke down the remaining one while really hamming it up about possibly throwing up on the table. It&#39;s a real team endeavor and actually a lot cuter than it sounds. 

We got a crap-ton of stuff because food is my favorite drug. Here&#39;s just a hint of what we took down and what we thought of it:

Green Tea: It was cold. It was rainy. This was needed.
http://bit.ly/1t0EoVo

Miso Soup: We start and finish with a miso because life feels better when it&#39;s bookended by bowls of miso soup.
http://bit.ly/1t0EoVo

Rock and Roll Roll: I don&#39;t usually like fried rolls, but this one was beautiful and damn good. Just look at that pic!
http://bit.ly/1vJQjoC

Octopus: Pretty darn delicious.
http://bit.ly/ZrvToX

Mackeral: Very mackeral-y... not exactly for me.
http://bit.ly/1oLutfh

Super White Tuna: Not bad at all. 
http://bit.ly/1CQCmIP

Red Snapper: This was the business.
http://bit.ly/1nbjtfJ

Sweet Potato Roll: A favorite of Andres&#39;. I think we actually got 2 orders of these it was so tasty.
http://bit.ly/1oLuDmU

Spicy Tuna Roll: This was my pic and it was just okay, I thought. 
http://bit.ly/1yIVc66

Eel &amp; Avocado Roll: Another that was so good we got 2 orders of it. 
http://bit.ly/1pJTms8

Yellowtail &amp; Jalapeno Roll: This was my favorite, and again we go two rolls of it because we have high metabolisms/ we don&#39;t care what anybody else thinks- we we&#39;re getting our $14.95 worth. 
http://bit.ly/Zrw1or

At lunchtime on a Friday we were the only people in the place, which is lit more appropriately for a date night, but we obviously didn&#39;t let that hold us back from eating roughly the same amount a baby rhino would.

The price is certainly a steal for lunch ($14.95) AYCE and we 100% got our money&#39;s worth and then some. If the next time I come back in town this place isn&#39;t around, I&#39;ll feel really bad because a part of me will know that we ate them out of brick and mortar with how much we ordered. Can&#39;t wait to come back and do this (http://bit.ly/ZPAXV3) all over again with my bud."

The sushi always tastes fresh and is never fishy. Service has always been great. The dinner menu has lots of options in terms of rolls or individual pieces. The only draw back is that they charge for whatever you don&#39;t eat. So you have to be careful how much you order. But at those prices, I can deal with it."

Walking in the door I immediately noticed how nicely the dining room was decorated and how clean the place was. Staff was friendly, especially Jerod at the bar, you chatted with us while we waited for our meal to be ready.

I ordered The Truck which is like a big 10 inch burrito with  all the necessities (Steak, shrimp, beef, chicken, pulled pork, beans, cheese, green chili, sour cream and lettuce). I think that&#39;s everything. And they give you their house hot sauce on the side to use at your discretion. It was a very flavorful Habanero based sauce which you need to be careful with if you&#39;re not used to &#34;heat&#34;. The flavor of it was just amazing though!!  I wish they&#39;d bottle it up and sell it. 

My friend had a Shrimp Taco and a Shrimp Po&#39; Boy Taco and they looked fantastic. I asked how they were and he said, &#34;easily five star.&#34;

Also, the dish I ordered was $10. For a very delicious meal that will fill me up (I&#39;m 6&#39;3&#34;, 240) I consider that a bargain!

I will definitely be making Fire It Up a regular weekly stop for dinner now that I&#39;ve discovered this little hidden jewel. Also, if you want to go and eat there the dining room is nice, clean, dimly lit and kind of cozy. Great for families. I personally wouldn&#39;t take a date there, but I won&#39;t take a date anywhere for Mexican unless we&#39;ve been together awhile. 

Oh, almost forgot!!  I don&#39;t eat sweets, but I saw something called a Mini Brownie Chimichanga and if you like warm gooey melted looking chocolate you should definitely order one for dessert. Like I said, I&#39;m not a dessert guy but even I was seriously tempted to order one of those suckers!!!!

Nothing more to say. A solid five stars all the way across the board! Enjoy!!!!"

I was there with my husband and two kids and we were shown to a table in the back near the kitchen entrance with high stools. How do they expect a 5 year old to sit on a high stool for that long. There were other open tables near the windows and in the center of the room, guess they don&#39;t want people with kids or Asians been seen in their establishment from out. We asked for the table near the window.
The food I understand is fusion tacos but it&#39;s bland and not worth $4 per taco. Their sangrias sucked it was wine with lemonade, I couldn&#39;t finish even half of the drink.
The only up side was our server, service was quick, after all they didn&#39;t have to put any effort in the food. 
The appetizers were bad too. The check was around $60 for 6 tacos and 2 appetizers and 3 drinks."

Honestly, I blame it on the server who treated this place like it&#39;s Taco Bell not offering suggestions or helping us out to get familiarized on the menu and their offerings... perhaps they have a special sauce that could have made the world of difference (???) or a way of eating that would have added Fire to the taste. Whatever it was, there was something lacking to majority of the items we ordered--- taste!

We came here for lunch with high expectations and empty stomachs. They seemed to have a good deal for lunch - $8.00 for two tacos and one side. It&#39;s like getting your side order free. Well, it&#39;s not such a good deal when the sides are tasteless and basic. Parmesan chips- chips sprinkled with Parmesan. Didn&#39;t come with salsa or any dip so now you&#39;re eating chips sprinkled with Parmesan. Hi guys... dry, boring, and it taste like fried cardboard sprinkled with Parmesan! The beans and rice, yes you get just that. Beans and rice no seasoning, no salt, again with no taste. I&#39;m beginning to think they offer some magic taste somewhere that we completely missed. Being our first time there, we have no idea, if taste existed or not. All of our tacos were creative (cheeseburger taco, chopped salad taco, etc) but again with no taste. 

WHY?!!!!??? I wanted to love this place because I love tacos but leaving this place with no after taste but blandness, no desire to ever return and still an unsatisfied stomach, I sure don&#39;t have room for another bookmark. I love the concept but this place either fell short on taste or a good server to guide the patron."

This is not your typical taco joint.  No, this place is more of a taco lounge where they step up food quality a few notches.  Although the alcohol option is limited, the food here is pretty good.  The locally sourced ingredients are always fresh.  The new location is bigger, but the decor the ambiance is the same.  They carry a nice selection of craft beer that is written on the wall.  

Parmesan Chips $2 - I love these things!  There isn&#39;t much to it, but they are so crispy and tasty.

Side of quinoa $2.50 - Refreshing and delicious!  If you want more of it, you can get the full shrimp quinoa salad for $9.

Gringo Taco $3.50 - This deep fried taco is one of my favorites here.

Cuban Rolls $8 - These were like deep fried egg roll.  AOk.

No, this is isn&#39;t &#34;Mexican&#34;. It&#39;s fusion. The only thing &#34;Mexican&#34; about this place is the concept that they&#39;re versions of tacos, but the tacos themselves are anything but. 

The Chips and Salsa were fantastic on one of the occasions. --only fantastic fresh from the fryer though. Very thick and sprinkled with parmesan and herbs. Not Mexican, but still delicious. The 2nd time I had them, they were cooled and slightly stale tasting. I wouldn&#39;t have ordered them had I known I would not be getting fresh ones. I did enjoy the Cuban Rolls, but &#34;spicy&#34; should not be in the title. I could barely taste any heat at all. Our waiter (who probably knows me by name now) suggested the Shrimp Wantons and he was right on. --they are the best of the appetizers. 

I have now tried the Chophouse Taco, the Southwest Chicken Taco, the BBQ Pork, and the Shrimp Po&#39; Boy and enjoyed every one of them. My single only complaint is that while I do really like the Lemon Aioli --a common layer in many of their tacos-- having it in so many caused them to all taste very much the same. I personally think they need to change it up just a little to keep things more interesting.  But with so many choices, you could be happy with any number of options no matter what you crave. 

Only one dessert option though? The Mini Brownie Chimichangas are... not very exciting. The positive is that they are &#34;mini&#34;. You can take one or two and not feel much guilt, but I wouldn&#39;t order them again. While I&#39;m not a Trixie who needs mind-blowing food at every meal, I do want food that will at least blow up my skirt a little bit!"

The chips and salsa are tasty too; I especially like the little parmesan crunch they add to the tortilla chips. Nice little kick. Plus the salsa comes in two varieties and that is always a plus for me. Jimmy likes his sauces, salsas and condiments of every kind. 

Anyway, last night I went with the steak taco (amazing) and the chophouse taco which may be the best taco I&#39;ve ever had. Ever. In. My. Life. 

Actually, it&#39;s probably not fair to say that because I have had lots of tacos, but I&#39;m telling you straight up that the chophouse taco stands alone on the Fire It Up menu. It&#39;s packed with flavor, crunch, filling and a crazy ass sauce that I can&#39;t describe except to say it is piquant. And I&#39;m not even sure what that word means, but I feel like it is the correct descriptor of the taco. So let&#39;s stay with it. 

The margaritas are good and generous and the prices are right, especially on taco Tuesday. After two trips here and sampling a total of eight tacos between my woman and I, I really believe you could just close your eyes and point to the menu and you would be very pleased with what showed up on your plate. 

Small place, kinda loud, farm to table, reasonable prices, great food, unusual combination of flavors and all in all, a mighty good joint to visit."

However, my hubby didn&#39;t like it at all! I think he would have done better with different tacos than he ordered. He just didn&#39;t care for the consistency of the filling and the taste didn&#39;t wow him. The atmosphere is inviting and they have a good selection of beers. The guac and chips was really unique - delicious guac, chunky and fresh with no off taste, and the chips had a dusting of parmesan. Those went fast! Hubby and I both ordered veggie tacos, then he had a gringo taco and I had a Southwest Chicken taco. They were nicely presented and very different in flavor.

I had the chips &amp; guacamole, portabella and veggie tacos. The chips were by far the best thing I ate - at first I thought, parmesan cheese on tortilla chips?! But they&#39;re delicious! The guacamole was just okay - nothing to really set it apart from grocery store dip. 

The tacos - the reason to come here - were really not that good. I couldn&#39;t really taste either the mushrooms or the veggies on either taco, as they were overwhelmed by the greens and in particular the &#34;lemon aioli&#34; sauce - so it really tasted like I was eating greens with ranch on a tortilla. The veggie taco in particular was strange, as it had an inordinate amount of plain white rice (scattered with a few beans, which supposedly were &#34;chimichurri&#34; style rice &amp; beans). It wasn&#39;t gross, per se, but certainly not at all what I was expecting. And especially for their price, I would expect better.

Service was okay, although - especially for it being such a small spot - my server almost didn&#39;t check on me throughout my entire meal (right when I was going to ask for the bill, she finally asked how things were - had there been anything wrong, I would&#39;ve had to have been very proactive about it).

I won&#39;t be coming back - but based on most others&#39; reviews, that doesn&#39;t look to be a problem for this place."

As for service, the people who helped me were super friendly and helpful.  Their smiles were infectious. 

Food was great and delicious.  I loved every bite.  As I understand that everything is organic and fresh, I still have a hard time with paying what I paid.  Maybe if they added something with the tacos like chips or rice and beans, it could also be justified.  Part of my cheap self is coming out but, I just can&#39;t help it.

They are all about the tacos at Fire It Up. All the servers looked attentive, but tonight Nicole was our server and she rocked. Gave us a brief history of the place, a run down of how things work ordering wise, and explained how fresh and local everything was (to a point, no shrimping in Chicago).

Three words: taco fusion tapas. Tapas people! With tacos! I ordered the Gringo, Veggie, Portobello, and Po&#39; Boy. I believe this place has ruined me for all tacos from now on.

I tried convincing our server to let the owners know my down has a prime location up for auction on Bull Valley and rt.31. We have lots of areas for local farming. McHenry could use an amazing place like this.

If you&#39;re in the area, or even if you&#39;re not, check this place out. You won&#39;t regret it."

My wife and I have been regulars of FIU since they started out as a food truck parked at Solemn Oath Brewery years ago.  I remember meeting the owner and being impressed with his vision and passion for his business.  They source as much as they can from local businesses and they did a great job of serving creative and delicious food.  

During our first visit years ago to their original location by the Route 59 train station, we talked about my wife&#39;s food allergy to garlic with the owner.  He was very informative about the menu and made the necessary adjustments to my wife&#39;s order to make sure she would not get sick and have a pleasurable experience.  I&#39;m happy to say she did and it was at that moment we became regulars of the restaurant.  We made sure to tell our friends about our experience and how impressed we were with the restaurant.  Also, it&#39;s not uncommon for us to visit FIU multiple times during a month, bringing upwards of 10 people at a time. 

FIU recently made the move to their new facility down the street in Naperville.  My wife and I went to check it out the other night.  When it came time to place our food order, we were informed by the waiter that they no longer could handle my wife&#39;s food allergy, even though it&#39;s says on the menu to notify your server of food allergies. Apparently it&#39;s too time consuming for the kitchen to handle special requests.  This was confirmed by the manager on duty.  The way it was handled by the manager made my wife feel humiliated, embarrassed, and ashamed of her food allergy.  This is not a choice for her.  This is something that she has to live with and deal with on a daily basis.  

My wife and I have dined at many restaurants over the years.  We understand not everyone will be able to handle her food allergy.  It&#39;s unfortunate that FIU is now one of those establishments.  Luckily for us, we have plenty of other options in the area.  FIU was once a great restaurant that we would highly recommend to friends and family.  Unfortunately that is no longer the case."

I&#39;ve tried every taco on the list and all are great. The staff is super friendly, give great recommendations, and get to know you. Look out for the seasonal/special tacos as they are great and only around for a bit. Take advantage of the $3 tacos on Tuesdays, too.

My favorite part is the great 90s alternative soundtrack that always playing there. A little harder to hear in their newer, larger location, but still great."

As a regular of FIU since well before the Aurora location moved to Naperville I thought I knew what to expect from the new location. 

I was wrong. 

It clearly states on the menu :

&#34;Let us know about your food aversions&#34;

That should mean if you have an allergy they can accommodate you.

My group was always gratefully accommodated at the old location in Aurora, but now the kitchen is apparently magic and it&#39;s impossible to put together anything to meet the needs of those with allergies. The staff who knew us was apologetic. The new manager was an absolute prick and couldn&#39;t care less.

We heard a litany of excuses. The line isn&#39;t setup for it. The kitchen cannot keep up. The new management won&#39;t allow it. 

All of these excuses were complete and utter bullshit. 

Beyond that the new location at Naperville is noisy. Incredibly noisy. So noisy the hostess has to go outside to answer the phone. 

FIU has lost its way. I won&#39;t be going back."

One of our friends has a garlic allergy and they have always been extremely accommodating. They moved to the new location a couple weeks ago and now they don&#39;t bother to accommodate allergies or special requests. They pre marinate all of the meats, so good luck getting any of that. They pretty much limit you to portabella if you want any protein. Too bad, so sad if you wanted anything else. I used to love this place, but they&#39;ve definitely gone from their humble beginnings and now don&#39;t care at all.

I guess sometimes a needless change in management isn&#39;t always the solution.

I personally will never be back to what was once my regular Tuesday night spot."

My wife was crazing taco so I looked for a meatless option and found Fire it Up.  Glad we did!  Since they are moving no point in reviewing the location, just say I hope they get new seating.  The hostess has miserable, seemed like she wanted nothing to do with being at the place and said nothing - not a word.  The server was polite and explained the move and daily specials.

We ordered the guac and chips.  The chips were great!  Seemed like thy were made that day and were flavorful.  The guac was good, not great, a little bland and ordinary.  My little one did gobble it up.  

For dinner my wife ordered a shrimp and mushroom taco.  Both were fresh and had good flavors.  I had a chicken and a shrimp taco.  The chicken worth going back for and i will!  They don&#39;t have a kids menu, but the server let us know the will do a kids quesadilla - which we got and she enjoyed. 

On beverages - they offer local draft beers, bottles of soda (interesting options), but no Mexican beers or regular soda option.

Overall food was a 4 - server a 4 and hostess a 1 and the music a 1.  I enjoy a good heavy metal song, just not for dinner music.  But Tool does rule!"

Despite what people may think/assume, I did not grow up eating tacos and very rarely eat them now, so I was incredibly surprised and delighted to find a unique taco joint (that I would love) in an area saturated with them.  Serving fresh, organic food, and making everything in-house, Fire It Up serves around ten to twelve different &#39;fusion&#39; style tacos using wonderful ingredients and interesting flavor combinations along with a few tasty appetizers.  There are probably around a twelve to fifteen or so tables, so it can get packed in there, but the food and the service are top-notch and well worth the wait if there is one.

Unlike the vast majority of taco joints, the tacos here are made with a larger-sized FLOUR tortilla, but can also be made with a corn tortilla or a lettuce wrap upon request; I, however, love the flour tortilla and have not yet tried a corn or lettuce version.  Again, they offer about a dozen or so, but after three visits--and sampling other&#39;s tacos--I&#39;ve only tried six or seven; I&#39;ve liked everything I&#39;ve tried, but there are a few that I particularly love:

     Portabella Mushroom Taco: simple but flavorful, it&#39;s topped with mixed greens and a freakin&#39; AWESOME lemon aioli.

     BLT Taco: who needs a description of this bad boy right here??  It&#39;s only made with a couple strips of bacon, but the strips AREN&#39;T thin and they ARE meaty and tasty.

     Shrimp Taco: beautiful, fresh, tasty shrimp with greens and more of that beautiful lemon aioli, I&#39;ve ordered this taco every time.

     BBQ Pork Taco: you just can&#39;t go wrong when you put some great pulled pork with greens on a flour tortilla.  A huge credit to them, though, their pulled pork and the bbq sauce is better than a LOT of pulled pork at actual bbq places.

The appetizers are good in general, but I love their shrimp wontons, and though it&#39;s a pretty small serving, they&#39;re so good that I don&#39;t mind.  Three sides are offered: parmesan crusted chips, rice and beans with chimichurri, and a quinoa salad; all three are great, but I think the rice and beans are the real standout.  The only dessert they offer are mini chocolate chimichangas, and it&#39;s unfortunate too because I didn&#39;t particularly care for it, and I am a desserts kind of guy--it&#39;s something I factor into my decision when eating out--but they were by no means terrible.  They do serve alcohol, proudly displaying the fact that they only serve local craft beer, but I don&#39;t really like beer so I can&#39;t comment on that; however, they also offer sangria, which is pretty good, and a whole lot better than sangria usually is.

They do run deals and specials--including Taco Tuesday ($3 tacos, normal prices are around fifty cents to a dollar more)--but I love their $8 lunch special (Tuesday through Friday), which comes with any two tacos and a side.  You can also carry out if you can&#39;t dine in, and though of course everything is better hot and fresh out of the kitchen, the tacos do travel well.  So if you haven&#39;t tried this place yet and find yourself in the area, you can either stop in and have a bite or carry out if you&#39;re pressed for time; don&#39;t love tacos? give this place a try and you might just change your tune.  The service has also been as good as the tacos, attentive and friendly, and I know it shouldn&#39;t matter, but it&#39;s the kind of thing that I notice: I love the music.  Great food, great atmosphere, great price!"

Came here due to all the great reviews and expected quality food for the steep prices. $4something for a taco is what you could expect from the best taco restaurants in the middle of Chicago. 

This place doesn&#39;t come close to that. The tacos were okay, but I&#39;ve had better from Mexican shacks charging waaaay less. They are extremely overpriced here for what you get and they really aren&#39;t that good, especially not what these reviews would have you believe.

The &#34;Chimichurri&#34; Rice and Beans are an absolute JOKE! There was no chimichurri. In fact, it was literally plain rice with plain canned beans poured over. It had no seasoning what so ever, let alone any chimichurri. I had to ask for salt just to be able to eat it, and I actually like canned beans. I don&#39;t know how they made such an easy thing taste so bland and so terrible.

Total rip off and bad food. Skip this place and go to Chipotle, hell just go to Taco Bell!"

I&#39;d say they&#39;re similar in size to a Taco Bell taco, but cost three or four times as much and weren&#39;t much tastier. For the cost of two tacos here, I could have gotten a meal at Chipotle that would have tasted much better, and would have pleasantly filled me up.

It&#39;s a small, easy to miss place, that boasts local craft beers, organic produce, and I think the server said some (or is it all?) local or organic meats.  

The parm chips were amazing, and they can also make them without the parm for dairy allergies.  We thought about getting &#34;The Rail,&#34; a set of 12 tacos of 4 different types, but we ended up getting different orders instead.  The truck (burrito) was generously sized and seemed to be enjoyed.I didn&#39;t try the BBQ pork taco but that seemed to be a huge hit at the table. The chicken tacos and gringo tacos were also well-liked.  One person thought the steak in his taco was too dry and tough. 

Another review mentioned that corn tortillas were not an option for tacos, but we definitely had that as a choice the night we were there (and a couple of people opted for corn instead). 

The local craft beers were enjoyed, as was the homemade lemonade. I went for the margarita but it had a watered down taste to it. It may just depend on who&#39;s making it, but I probably wouldn&#39;t order one again.

The brownie chimichangas seem to be a big hit in the reviews but no one in my group was crazy about them. The dessert had an interesting look to it, but taste-wise just nothing interesting going on.  

It felt like we had some hits and some misses. But the hits were good enough that we&#39;re really looking forward to going back!"

With that being said and the star rating I have given Fire It Up completely disappointed me tonight. I have been a regular customer but was completely appalled at how a food intolerance was taken into consideration by the manager on duty.

I&#39;m not a chef or anything but I have cooked in professional kitchens and I only graduated culinary school. I have a reasonable idea of how to accommodate people who have actual food intolerances and it seemed as though no one was willing to put forth a little extra effort to make it right. The options were severely limited because &#34;all the proteins are marinated&#34;. Seriously, all of them?! Aren&#39;t you afraid about denaturing the protein if it&#39;s marinating too long?  There has to be something on deck waiting to be prepped that you can throw on a grill or flat top and add salt and pepper to. That&#39;s what FIU did in the past but since the change in management I guess they just prep everything.  We weren&#39;t asking for fresh made garlic free guacamole, we understand that you have doubled in size at the new location but at least can we have something more that a tortilla with quinoa and mushroom??  

There is also a big difference between &#34;no onions please, they&#39;re yucky&#34; and &#34;I will be needing my Epi-pen, please&#34;.  They need to do this research before they claim they are accommodating to aversions. 

Sadly, I will not be coming back. The food is tasty but the way they handled tonight, no more taco Tuesday, or Friday, or any day."

Bad sign when u go to a mexican restaurant and only flour tortillas Ok so walked in its a small lil place not the prettiest not the ugliest jus meh funny thing there were only couples at the moment so they dimmed the lights it was cute n when more people came they turned them back on regarding the service i wish we got the other waiter she was so much more helpful to the table rite next to us our waiter was jus like hi and bye and kept disappearing really awkward jus sitting here waiting for her she was the girl with blond hair try to  get the  girl with the dark hair she seemed like such a great waiter!

gringo taco:  it was really crunchy and flavorful jus wish there was a lil more meat in it this is a must order though best taco of the night 

shrimp tacos: really good needed a lil salt though they were really tender like cooked perfectly there were wasnt alot of shrimp in it though the sauce was really good though jus wish instead of so much veggie jus make a coleslaw 

Southwest taco: good needed salt though not alot of meat in it though to much filler with the veg 

Steak taco: good needed salt though the flavor of it was really good there was alot of meat and it was tender

Bbq pork taco: this was my least favorite it was way to sweet like to the point where i felt like imma go into a sugar coma 

Cheese burger taco: tastes like a burger lol its just ground beef and ingredients from a burger wouldnt order it again

Brownie chimichanga: omg order this!! Best part of the meal lol its jus brownie batter stuffed into lil egg rolls and fried really good"

Food is good, service was very good, atmosphere is loud but very nice.  I will be going again to try more taco fusion.
The tacos were packed full of meat, to the point of overflow.  Options include wheat, and corn tortillas  plus lettuce wraps so they are gluten free friendly."

We came here on a whim on a cold Sunday night an hour before they closed. The strip mall it&#39;s in is not well lit and I drove around it two times before finally figuring out where it was. It was almost empty when we arrived, and I felt guilty coming so late. But I also wanted tacos. Oops.

We walked in and were seated in a corner in this teeny tiny restaurant. The place is clean, well lit, and cool looking, without teetering on trendy or annoying. Our server was SO awesome and walked us through the menu, their concept, and their stress on local food and drink. The husband and I both ordered a Filbert&#39;s cream soda (delish!) and chips and guac to start. The chips and guac was SO FREAKING GOOD. Homemade Parmesan dusted chips that weren&#39;t at all greasy and a delicious, smooth guacamole. I tried a tiny taste of their hot sauce but alas, it was too spicy for me, so I drowned the delicious chips in guacamole while we waited for our food.

I got a gringo taco, a bbq pork, and a BLT. The gringo was decadent - a fried tortilla filled with deliciousness that became an almost creamy consistency as I ate it. The BBQ pork was flavorful without being too spicy. The BLT had GREEN tomatoes on it and was filling without being obnoxious. I would order every one of them again. Husband got a portobello mushroom and chophouse taco and inhaled them. I tried a piece of the steak on the latter and found it amazingly well seasoned.

As if that wasn&#39;t enough gluttony, we ordered the brownie chimichanga for dessert (after our waiter assured me it was FINE to order dessert - I hate being at a restaurant too late and holding people up from going home). It&#39;s a plate of 6 mini chimichangas full of brownie, covered in chocolate sauce and powdered sugar. I don&#39;t even like brownies, and this was to die for. I would order it every time I came.

And we will definitely be back. I have so much I need to try, including their margaritas and sangria! I can&#39;t believe this place has been here all this time and I haven&#39;t been eating here. I have to make up for lost time."

Eric the General Manager was a great host. They have quality tacos and i must say that i fell in love for the green salsa they have there lol i wanted to somehow bring it back to the hotel room with me haha.
I had a shrimp and vegetarian tacos and we also got an order of the salsa and guacamole it was damn good !!! for dessert we had the brownie chimichangas they had a nice crunchy texture and not too sweet even tho they were covered in powder sugar. Ill definitely be back for more tacos when I&#39;m back in Chicago ."

This little fusion taco joint in a mini strip mall is conveniently located just off Route 59 in the backyard of the train station.  It&#39;s easy to miss because there is a long strip mall behind the 4 or 5 stores that make up the strip where you&#39;ll find FIU. Tiny place, says it seats 45. 

We went on a Sunday evening and had to wait about 10 minutes for a low table. The high tops feature steel stools with no backs, so old people like me need to wait for a low top! Our server approached very quickly and took our drink orders, and then asked if we had questions about the menu. They must get a lot of questions on the per taco pricing, because pricing was for individual tacos -- even at $3 to $4.50 each. 

My son had the fresh lemonade -- tasty. I had the Intelligentsia black iced tea. Oddly flavored but very refreshing. Don&#39;t expect a Lipton-taste from this tea, however. My husband had a Belgian ale of some sort and it arrived in a short little 6 ounce glass -- I think the small glass had him drinking slower. He liked his brew, too.

We ordered the parmesan chips and guac and the shrimp won ton thingies. The guac was delicious, fresh and tasty paired with the fluffy chip sprinkled (before cooking?) with parmesan. It&#39;s an odd little combo but works deliciously. The shrimp wontons were also fresh fresh fresh -- shrimp and veggies and a tasty little sauce on a flat won ton. My son is an adventurous eater but knows what he likes. He liked the wontons --my husband loved them. I had one bite and lost the second bite to my son....he&#39;s 11 and needs the calories way more than I do!.

We each ordered one taco -- a cheeseburger for my son, the steak taco for husband and I had the veggie. We all loved our choices, but both my meat-eaters seemed to have entree envy of my veggie -- piled with beans and rice, fresh veggies and a beautiful lemon aioli. We each left one bite on our plate. We arrived starving and went home very full with what seemed like a light dinner. Not so....light and refreshingly tasty and crisp, yes. But it filled us up!

The service was fantastic. The server was pleasant with impeccable timing. 

Our tab was a little high, but we agreed that we&#39;d rather pay more and get fresh and tasty food than pay a little less and get splat food.

I wish we had one closer to home! The takeout business was very brisk on this Sunday night. I could see regular takeout if we lived in the hood.

Go. Don&#39;t expect traditional tacos.....set your taste buds free and let them do the tasting!

PS. Music selection was alternative....matched the ambience and the food."

I figured I would use it for fire up soon it was my first time there and I&#39;ve been wanting to try this place. It was extra special cause I was out with my diva and bff Courtney Crowley. As divas we went shopping before we got dinner. That&#39;s neither here nor there. 

First off I drank Courtney&#39;s glass of water cause I was so dang thirsty. After rehydrating myself I took charge and ordered the guac and parmesan chips. They were glorious. The guac and parm chips were on point like MJ hitting a jump shot. After that lovely appetizer I ordered the steak with portobello and gringo tacos. Courtney had the gringo, cheeseburger and some other one that I can&#39;t remember. But really who cares. This review is about my experience. (Selfish mofo). We both loved the tacos that we got. They were really good and I liked the experience of having a fusion taco. I will definitely be back sometime soon. The service was great and they were on point with refilling our drinks. 

Finishing touch. If you like tacos like a fat kid loves anything then you need to check this place out. Don&#39;t worry you&#39;ll thank me for it."

Moving from their location West of 59 has become the best thing that could have happened for the establishment in my opinion. Samantha was very kind and provided the upmost exceptional customer service. I was briefed about the history of the business, suggested a great local craft beer and schooled on the well executed menu. What Fire It Up does well is source local ingredients and products from surrounding communities, adding a sense of social responsibility to one&#39;s dining experience. I cannot forget to mention the craft beer draft offering which seems carefully selected and vies to be a craft beer lovers haven.  Not only do I give the establishment an A+, I will make an effort to bring the &#34;Lunch Crew&#34; here at least once a month. As an insurance professional, we are typically creatures of habit; Fire It Up has just ruffled the feathers and has given me a run for my taste buds. Cheers!"

Their ingreidients are delicious as well as fresh.  I meet the owner when they were just a  food truck, soI relaize that the prices may seem a little high, but that is only because they pride themselves in sourcing some of the best ingredients possible.  The beers come in from local breweiries and are always a good choice.  Sangrias are slightly sweet for my taste but still delightful.

I like that they have homemade chips that are fried fresh with a tad bit of cheese.  It makes an order of salsa or guac quite enjoyable.  The real winner when you come here is the Fire It Up Sauce, which shoudl be called &#34;I put that S*** on everything&#34; because it is quite tasty.

I tried several of their tacos last time, and I love the indidivual offering of them because it offers you a chance at variety.  It is a quite place and a good place to go for a  meal in the suburbs."

Scouting for a new taste and found this amazing place. Love the concept of fusion style tacos. Great atmosphere, music and classic ambience. Service was good except for the fact that we had to wait 15 mins, which is again NBD. 

Food was just yummm..!! Ordered a lunch special with two taco of choice and a side. Gringo taco which comes with fried flour tortilla was delicious and chimichurri rice and beans on the side with some FIRE IT UP!! sauce was a perfect combination. My friend ordered a The truck and he was mesmerized with size and the taste. 

Definitely going back!!"

The salsa lacked flavor, and the guacamole was more of a paste and not the fresh chunky guacamole I prefer. The chips were very greasy as well. Oh and you have to pay for chips and salsa. We were still optimistic that the tacos were going to live up to all the hype. Well, they did bump up the rating to 3 stars, but that&#39;s all. We ordered the steak, Gringo, southwest chicken and shrimp tacos. The presentation was great, but all I tasted was sour cream on the steak, chicken and the aioli sauce on the shrimp. The steak had no flavor or seasoning. My wife said the gringo was good. With that being said, for the price of the tacos, we were definitely underwhelmed. I doubt we&#39;ll come back, but I&#39;m glad we tried it."

So when I looked at Fire It Up&#39;s menu upon a plea from the boyfriend, I didn&#39;t have high hopes. Fancified tacos on FLOUR tortillas? Pinche infierno ... not promising. 

But my prejudice was put to shame when I bit into my steak taco, which dripped with green chile juices from the tastiest nuggets of beef I&#39;ve eaten in a while. Equally delicious was the southwest chicken taco, with morsels of beautifully marinated and grilled chicken breast, mixed baby greens and a drizzle of spicy sour cream. The Gringo, heaped with a cheesy beef-and-bean mixture in a freshly fried shell, made me glad that the dark days of considering Taco Bell acceptable sustenance are years behind me. 

We both thought the creamy, blessedly tomato-free guacamole to be top-notch but frowned upon the accompanying stale parmesan-dusted chips. 

I really loved the margarita made with fresh lime and Tailwinds blue agave (don&#39;t call it tequila!), which is made in Plainfield at the state&#39;s only rum and agave distillery."

I loved how you could also substitute lettuce or corn tortillas for the usual flour wraps for each one. 

We had the veggie taco, cheeseburger, pulled pork, blt, and the steak taco. Each was super good. I also had the fresh homemade lemonade, which was lovely. Not too sweet but also refreshing. 

We also tried the one dessert they had. Which was brownies fried in wontons. Sounds odd, but it was AMAZING! Think gooey hot brownie with a crunchy outer shell. And they had this hot fudge kinda sauce drizzled on it. Soooooo yum!!

I&#39;ve been hearing, reading, and seeing a lot of hype about Fire It Up, so of course I had to get there ASAP to check it out!

The hubs and I came for dinner on Tuesday Taco Takeover night. Such a great deal - $3 tacos! BOOM. They have other week day deals which I&#39;ll be sure to come back for.  The restaurant is smaller than I thought, but it was perfect for a casual weeknight dinner.

I love that they (only) have local craft beer. We enjoyed a Solemn Oath brew on tap and you best believe we were happy about it. We were pretty hungry, so we started off with some chips and guac to hold us over until our order came out. I&#39;m not sure what it was exactly that made something so simple stand out, but I LOVED these chips and guacamole. Very good. I could have used some more guac though (can&#39;t we all). The dip to chip ratio was a little off.

Now... taco time. I honestly could have done some serious work on their menu, but the small health conscious responsible part of me decided it would be best if I stuck with just two tacos for my order. This made choosing hard...

Ended up going with the chopped house taco which includes sirloin steak, portabellas, onion, cabbage, baby swiss, and Fire It Up (FIU) steak sauce wrapped in a flour tortilla. I thought this sounded intriguing because well, I&#39;m always down for steak, but also I was curious about their FIU sauce. SOLID CHOICE. Muy delicioso! 

My second taco of choice was the BBQ pork taco. This little flour tortilla bundle was made up of pulled pork, BBQ, onion, and lemon aioli. AMAAAAAZING. This actually ended up being my favorite taco out of the two! 

My husband had the shrimp taco and cheeseburger taco. He said both were yummy but he like the cheeseburger one way better (which also surprised him).

On our way out we chatted with the manager who was a super cool guy. He knows a lot about the local craft beer seen and is all about supporting fellow local businesses. He gave us a heads up that on NYE they will have a lobster taco available! I want that..."

I will definitely be spending toooooo much money at this joint. 

So, yum. This place was stellar. Guac and chips can be a hit or miss deal with me. I&#39;m a guac snob. If the guac isn&#39;t good, I become immediately unhappy. This place blew me away with their Parmesan coated tortilla chips and delicious scoop of guac, all for an affordable $6.00. 

On to the tacos. I ordered the Southwest and the Gringo. Both were fantastic. I was pleasantly surprised by how big the tacos were. Sometimes, that&#39;s where places skimp out with the decent prices and low quality of tacos, but this place excelled. Of course, this isn&#39;t a traditional taco place, so their selection is quite interesting with the ingredients they have in each selection. I think the Gringo had baby swiss on it, which was definitely an interesting (but delicious) taste. Each taco is about $3.00 to $4.00 dollars, which can feel pretty pricey when you get 3 or 4 tacos, but I definitely think it&#39;s worth at least once visit. Promise, you&#39;ll come back for more because you&#39;ll be hooked.

The interior of this place is pretty casual. About 10 tables inside, so not too much seating on a busy night I&#39;m sure. The service was good - no complaints there. 

Although I&#39;m pretty sure they&#39;re probably lacing their tacos with small traces of Crack to make sure people become addicted to their food, because paying $4 dollars per taco makes me want to reconsider coming back,  I will definitely be returning to Fire It Up...because you know, their tacos...are so....addicting... :)"

The food is still tasty, but the service is terrible and we will no longer refer our clients to this restaurant as we have easily sent 100 people to eat here!

#1) CHECK YOUR BILL.  I have been overcharged 3 times and have to request to have the bill corrected. At first I chocked it up to a genuine mistake, but I now believe it&#39;s intentional or it wouldn&#39;t have happened 3 times!

#2) The service of Molly is atrocious. She simply should NOT be in the service industry. Our first visit she refused to write down the order (because she could remember it all she said, after my husband asked why she is not writing such a big order down, my husband having worked in F&amp;B for more than a decade) She gave us the wrong tacos and overcharged us.We asked for corn tortilla on ALL the tacos,since one in our party is eating gluten free, and ALL the tacos came with flour tortilla. When told about the wrong order, Molly replied :&#34;You would have done the same, since I&#39;m working straight for the past 7days&#34;, not even slightly phased by the mistakes.  OMG, this is simply beyond any service attitude that a server can ever have in front of a customer. But we actually put that to rest, giving her the benefit of the hard and long hours worked. 

#3) This last visit, Molly was our server again. We ordered chips that were stale (that apparently don&#39;t come with ANY KIND of salsa.) We were charged .50 for a whopping tablespoon of salsa that was enough for about 3 chips and at no point we were actually made aware that there is no salsa with the chips or that it will be extra. We would have ordered $2 worth of salsa to enjoy a $2 plate of stale chips, if we only knew. 

When my husband&#39;s burrito came, he asked for a side of salsa. Again with a bad attitude, Molly brought a red bottle and dropped it on the table. Failing to mention that it was not actually salsa, but THE HOTTEST hot sauce the place has (and my husband does enjoy spicy foods). We know this cause my husband asked,  &#34;Do you guys have anything hotter than this sauce?&#34;  and the reply came, &#34;There is nothing hotter in the whole restaurant!&#34; How do you even bring something like that to a customer and don&#39;t even mention that is HOT, being a Habanero based Hot Sauce  ! The hot sauce ruined my husband&#39;s burrito and his meal as he could barely finish or taste his burrito.

Finally, after I explicitly asked about $3 dollar Taco Tuesdays, we were still overcharged on the bill.

Sorry,  Fire It Up but we won&#39;t be coming back or send any taco lovers your way, not cause of the food but the service!"

This location is larger and the tables are more comfortable. I&#39;ve heard they&#39;ll have outdoor seating which will be nice, although I think they&#39;ll be overlooking the parking lot. Service was faster than I remember and the food is still delicious but loud head banging music made us want to leave! I don&#39;t remember this from their other location! 

Their new location seems to be bringing in more customers but we still had no problem seating a party of three at 6 pm.

We were waiting for a third person, so we ordered some chips and salsa to hold us over. The Parmesan chips were delicious. All of the tacos looked amazing, but I settled on the BBQ pork taco and the southwest chicken taco. The southwest chicken taco was the best I had that night. The BBQ pork was good too, but had a little too much sauce for my liking. I also tried a bite of the gringo taco and was not a fan. I think the fried shell actually took away from it."

I recently introduced my fiance to FIU, and although he wasn&#39;t too thrilled the first time ( &#34;the Truck&#34; had too much veggie/not enough meat and cheese for his liking), we came today and got the cheeseburger tacos. He wolfed three down easily, which really wasn&#39;t a surprise. The big surprise is this is the second time we ordered the shrimp wonton appetizer.  Neither of us like shrimp, but we love these. At first I didn&#39;t care for an appetizer but he looked at me and said &#34;but what about the shrimp wontons?&#34; That&#39;s when you know the food is fabulous; if you can get two people who despise shrimp eager to get the appetizer, you&#39;re doing something right. 

Looking forward to a repeat round of the Greek tacos starting next Thursday. Even M said &#34;we&#39;re define coming back for those!&#34; I&#39;ve had them before and they&#39;re nothing short of phenomenal. I wish they were a permanent part of the menu."

Looks different,... could be the new server who was pleasant, professional and just ready to put everybody at ease with his winning smile. :-) 

This time hubby and I took our younger son for a bite to eat after our 8 week blood letting, (a.k.a. donating blood at Heartland Blood Center in Aurora. Everyone should donate if you can - it does save lives)... And once again Fire it Up was worth the trip through the road construction on route 59 and delivered more than what I ever expected. 

Sometimes places wane with their service, ingredients, and/or prices, (actually cost sometimes increase), however, Fire it Up is still the at the top of their game. They serve up great appetizers, and TACOS, that are so different from the norm and those cute little desserts. 

Fire it Up still going great..."

Parm chips and guacamole were good. The guacamole is smooth not chunky but is a good match for the light chips. Shrimp wontons are good but the wonton is a bit fragile to carry the weight of the toppings. The cabbage could be cut a little thinner to balance the texture but it&#39;s still a good compliment.

I had a bunch of tacos and all were good. Could use a bit more filling for the $$. Their green sauce is one of the best I&#39;ve had, we&#39;ll balanced flavor &amp; heat. I was surprised when one of my favorites was the Southwest chicken taco with added green sauce. They use good cut chicken NOT the dry shredded flavorless type you get in most other places. 

My only real complaint were the margaritas. Flavor and delivery was spot on but I could not tell there was any alcohol in them. I had four within 90min and was not even buzzed! Unfortunately I&#39;d say skip them and get beer if you want to feel something...  Visited Oct 2014"

Not an overload of food, but high quality food at reasonable prices. We took advantage of their lunch special; Two Tacos (mix and match) and a side for $8.00

Enjoyed some Filbert&#39;s Old Time Diet Root Beer

We started with the guacamole and parmesan chips. Yum! The guac has almost a light, whipped texture and was great with the flavorful chips. I liked spreading some of their Jalapeno-Habanero sauce on them too... comes in a handy to use squeeze ketchup bottle.

I had a gringo taco (I wasn&#39;t going to but the waitress likes them.. I was thinking &#34;I ain&#39;t no stupid Gringo&#34; and then remembered that&#39;s exactly what I am) the shell was warm and the beef, bean etc.. filling was delicious, just the right balance of everything. The steak taco was equally delightful... what really caught me by surprise were the Chimichurri rice and beans, they were a surprise bowl of awesomeness... completely unexpected. I tasted Lisa&#39;s Quinoa salad, it too was delicious... but I would still get the beans again.

And of course, you really can&#39;t go here without trying the only dessert they offer.. the mini brownie chimichangas... still warm and share-able for $6... 

Seriously, limited menu but focused on quality and value... hard to argue with that!"

They feature such tacos as: shrimp, beef, gringo (which has a fried shell), portobello, veggie and more. I&#39;d recommend stopping in for the lunch special Tuesday through Friday 11-4 where you can mix and match two tacos and one side for $8.

Ok, that might be a stretch, but seriously - I need to move within walking distance so I can come to FIU every single stinking day. I&#39;ve been lucky enough to dine here twice, but I&#39;m already planning trip # 3. 

There&#39;s very few places that I&#39;ve been to where I feel like nothing needs to be changed or improved. FIU is one of the only places I&#39;ve been to that possess that bragging right. My first venture here was with the Yelp Elite event where we got to try almost every taco they had on the menu. My two favorites were the pulled pork and the Gringo. 

I came back this past Wednesday with a few other Yelpers. Sadly, I was the only one without a partner to split a taco rail with ($10 off on Wednesdays, which makes it only $35 or $17.50 per person if you split with another person) so I ended up going for the Truck burrito. I was a little in shock when reading the menu that it had all of the different types of meat in it, so I had to ask just to make sure. When our super hot waiter (irrelevant I know, but maybe the girls reading this will be interested?) said that I read it right, I knew that was what I had to order. It was about the same size as a Chipotle burrito and would usually last me 2 meals. However, I&#39;d only had a salad all day, so I was starved and finished all of it. 

It was nothing short of delicious. Some may think all of the meat on it may make it too rich, but it was perfect. The beans were also really flavorful and made it very moist. 

Even though there were 11 of us, our server was awesome. He made sure we were all taken care of and that everything was perfect. If you can&#39;t tell already, of course I highly recommend that you eat at Fire It Up. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll then have the same love affair with it that I do."

Blessing: I would be en route to obesity from eating so many tacos deliciosos. 

Curse: I&#39;m in withdrawal. Big, hangry withdrawal from Fire It Up&#39;s awesome tacos. And Naperville isn&#39;t nearby. 

So, I&#39;ve resorted to just recalling their perfect weekday lunch special: $8 for two tacos, and one side. If you find yourself in the area and craving a creative, fantastic fusion taco, you must sidle up to this modern but simple spot. While I&#39;ve only been once, I was delighted with lunch I devoured...

-Gringo Taco: Full of (fat and) flavor! Gotta love a fried tortilla. 

-Shrimp Taco: Simply fried shrimp but done very well and paired wonderfully with a bright cabbage slaw. 

-Quinoa Salad: This side was the healthy component of my meal - and it tasted like it. I mean that in a good way, it was just a surprise compared to the heavier fare on the menu. 

I envy those in Naperville who can frequent Fire It Up. Eat a handful of tacos in my honor, friends.

The building really blends into the surroundings with a tiny sign and windowless building - it&#39;s so much better inside, I promise.

I stopped in during lunch time on my day off.  It was pretty busy, but when a place closes early, isn&#39;t it always the lunch rush?  My only gripe with Jake&#39;s is their hours.  They close at 3pm, which means I can only go on a weekend or on a day off.

There&#39;s almost an endless amount of options for bagels and cream cheese, my next stop is either going to be chocolate chip or jalapeno cream cheese.  But not both.

I got a Lox bagel sandwich here.  I&#39;ll admit, I like the Lox sandwich at Schmaltz just a little bit more, but the bagel (poppyseed) was great.  The ladies working here are nice and give you plenty of options (what kind of bagel? cream cheese? okay, toasted or not?).

They are ubiquitous in every deli, and independent bagel shops are just about in every neighborhood. Unfortunately, the most we in the Midwest get is Panera, Einstein, and the &#34;barely&#34; a bagel Dunkin Donuts dough bomb. This morning brought me a delightful delivery from Jake&#39;s Bagels. A coworker brought bags of the pillowy, chewy goodness. I already ate breakfast, but just looking at the steam in the bag made me give in to temptation. I started with half a salt bagel with veggie cream cheese. It was like a morning pretzel made better for me (in my dreams) with pieces of fresh chopped veggies. So killer! I knocked off a bunch of salt though since it was a little much for me. 
Not to be a pig, I gave myself another hour before getting to bagel dessert. I had to try the cherry vanilla cream cheese on a blueberry bagel. Or at least I think it was blueberry. It was a purple hue and had tiny dark blue specks in it. A lot of mass produced doughs (like DD) actually use blueberry flavored cranberry pieces, I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s the case with Jake&#39;s. I&#39;d like to believe the pieces were so small because they&#39;re real blueberries. I covered it with cherry vanilla cream cheese. I would put that on a plain bagel next time though as the flavor muted the bagel itself. Do you see those whole maraschino cherries?? We had a green olive cream cheese this morning too, but I only gave it a small taste. It&#39;s really packed with that briny flavor you love or hate. Loved my second breakfast today.

They have 16-17 variations of bagels which whether served as-is, warmed up, toasted, filled with one of their homemade cream cheeses, or as a sandwich, will leave you feeling fantastic. They have many styles of coffee from a balanced Breakfast Blend to dark roasts and flavored varieties which are totally customizable with various syrups and flavorings.

I usually hate bagels, they&#39;re just giant rings of dough that were made to sit in your stomach and bloat you up. They&#39;re pretty gross. Jake&#39;s Bagels, however, are delicious rings of goodness that make you feel extra special and not at all gross. 

I had the banana nut bagel with the chocolate chip cream cheese. It was the perfect size: not too big, not too small. I am the Goldilocks of bagels apparently. My husband got the bagel sandwich with lox, scallion cream cheese, and everything bagel. It was delicious! It tasted like something you&#39;d get at a fancy New York deli.

Bonus points: they have a make your own coffee bar, complete with different flavors of coffee and syrups and a few different dairy options. As a coffee lover, my head wanted to explode."

     The service is fine ,however there is no line and things get  confused very quickly.
   The bagels are decent quality but are the smallest around and the priciest too.
    The overall vibe is you are just another number.
   The price per item is very high, something you would expect downtown or at a movie theatre............
If you have to have a bagel or want some breakfast food there are limited choices nearby ;

I ordered the Jake&#39;s bagel (everything bagel) with original cream cheese. They do not skimp on the cream cheese. They probably put half an inch or so of cream cheese on each bagel half. I will probably ask for less next time. Or get another plain bagel.
Nonetheless, it was delicious.
My fiancé got a cinnamon bagel with vanilla cream cheese and frankly I had to stop myself from going up and getting that one. The cream cheese was so fresh and delicious and I can see myself getting that one in the future. They have coffee with many different flavors. I wouldn&#39;t call it as good as Dunkin nor Starbucks, but it&#39;s good coffee if that&#39;s what you need to wake up in the morning.

Arriving on a Saturday just past Noon time, we were warmly greeted by the staff and helped with the surprisingly large menu.
    You can have your bagels toasted, warmed-up or room temperature and
with more than a dozen different types of bagels, just choosing more than one made for
decisions.  I took two, my favorite poppy seed and sesame both heated and smeared with butter.  I also had a small Chicken Dumpling soup, but there is so much more to the menu with numerous fresh sandwiches.
    The bagels were indeed a hit and the soup passed the test, loaded with more chicken than dumplings but very tasty.  My friend Bob had a Roast Beef luncheon special along with the soup, agreeing with me that Jake&#39;s was a pleasant surprise.
   Located along the east bank of the Fox River, while we decided to eat indoors, there is also a beautifully constructed large wooden deck where you can dine and have a scenic view looking north.
    Checkout the menu on its website and if you are in the area, Jake&#39;s now in its 22nd year offers enjoyable dining at very reasonable prices.  Now if only I was able to have taken some of those bagels home for the wife.  See you next year Jake&#39;s."

There is a spacious dining room here and an outdoor seating area that faces the river.  I stopped here before a Saturday afternoon bike ride up the Fox River.  What a great place to eat before leaving.  

I had a salt-rye bagel sandwich with a massive egg patty.  The bagels were fresh and chewy.  The coffee was hot and fresh.  The staff were friendly and service was quick.  The dining room was about half-full but definitely not crowded.  So, it had a nice relaxing weekend feel.

Nice selection of bagels; you can sit and eat if you like but I was on the run.

I frequent the Aurora Farmer&#39;s Market, and have recently been driving the bf to the train (thanks to the T-boning my cute little car received from a doe), and regularly drive right by this little shop. I&#39;ve often considered making a stop in, but every time I think about it, the place isn&#39;t open. So today, on an impulse turn, I made the trek inside. 
Oh. My. God. It&#39;s so cute inside! A little brick fireplace. Dark red tile floor, adorable vintage looking tables, some high top tables with bar stools. A counter loaded with fresh made bagels, another one full of homemade cream cheeses,  a huge coffee station (with pumpkin spice coffee and flavored creamers--I like vanilla in my pumpkin spice) I was a huge fan before I even ordered.
Finally after deciding on the hundreds of combinations to choose from, I went with an everything bagel and giardinara cream cheese. What a great choice! The giardinara gave the cream cheese an awesome flavor with just a hint of spice. The bagel was fresh and lightly toasted. Wow. 
The best part about Jake&#39;s, though, is the service. The employees here are smiling, perky, and seem to really enjoy their jobs. I was super impressed by everyone working (as a team) and it made me want to become a regular at this quaint little shop.

They&#39;ve got something for everyone, salt bagels, plain, egg, garlic, blueberry, you name it! 
In addition to fabulous breakfast choices, they prepare soups daily. 
A variety of choices are offered, usually a range of 4 to 5 selections daily. The chicken noodle is offered everyday and is decent but my favorites are the cream of mushroom and stuffed green pepper (other soups they offer include: Cream of Chicken and Wild Rice, Navy Bean, Chicken Tortilla, Wisconsin Cheese, New England Clam Chowder, Pasta Fagioli etc). Recently they&#39;ve started serving salads as well, and these are some giant salads with lots of fresh ingredients. Unfortunately for me, these salads and some of their lighter soups is how I usually get my Jake&#39;s fix these days.. 
In addition to soups and bagels, Jake&#39;s offers bagelwichs that can be purchased in many varieties (turkey, egg salad, BLT etc). Each one I&#39;ve had has been scrumptious. Their giant cookies and cupcakes are yummmm as well.

While you can come to Roma D&#39;Italia and certainly get a chicken dinner, I must highly recommend their White Pizza. Said pizza uses your choice of either Alfredo, or garlic and virgin oil as a base (rather than traditional red sauce) and your choice of two toppings.

In addition to the White Pizza, they have several other &#34;designer pizzas&#34;, including gyro, S.O.B. (sausage, onion, and bacon), Western, Chicken Ranch, and more. Of course you can build your own with traditional toppings, or branch out and give your pizza some capicola, eggplant, salami, or artichokes. 

Other menu items include soups and salads, subs and sandwiches (including cheeseburgers, philly steak sandwich, gyros, pepper &amp; egg), complete dinners that include fried chicken, bbq chicken, baby back ribs, jumbo shrimp; italian dinners like veal parmigiana, lasagna, calamari &amp; clams, chicken vesuvio, pasta primaviera..... it goes on and on and ON. There&#39;s something for everyone. Oh, did I mention they cater, too? Many different options are available at reasonable prices.

Inside the restaurant are about 4 (maybe 5) tables, and it looks like seating is available outside during the warmer months, however they were not set up today. The interior has a cozy yet casual feel. Red and white checkered tablecloths adorn the tables and soft lighting gives Roma a slight edge over most standard carryout places.

I believe it was the owner, Greg who took my order today. I ordered my pizza on site and decided to wait around for it. When it was ready he brought the box to me, which I thought was a very nice gesture. 

The crust is unlike most pizza crusts; this stuff is flaky and well cooked. The rolled crust is unique; a slight crunch on the outside yet the inside is soft and chewy. I loved it!  The oil and garlic combination is so delicious and my toppings (pepperoni and black olive) were evenly proportioned, neither sparse nor abundant. 

I look forward to trying other menu items in the near future, and hope to try to make it for lunch during the week sometime. They have quite a few lunch specials, all at super affordable prices.  I also hope to try delivery as well. Great job, Roma, you&#39;ve got yourself a new fan."

I like how I can order 1/2 pizza of one specialty pizza, and another on the other 1/2. They don&#39;t charge you at all for this custom topping design. Other places will charge you extra for this.

I went to pick up some food my fiance ordered, and when I picked it up, it was not packed properly and leaked in my car. As soon as I got out it fell through the paper bag into the ground. I called to complain and either try to get more food or at least a 50% refund, and was told to stop back by the cashier. When I got there, the owner started yelling at me as soon as I walked in the door saying it was my fault and to leave with no refund. He made me go back home, pick the food up off the floor outside, and bring it all back before giving me a refund. He then proceeded to check through all the food one by one to make sure we had not eaten anything. He then started insulting me and my fiance calling her a &#34;little slut&#34; and getting two inches from my face yelling at me.

Having recently moved to Warrenville, we found Roma D&#39;Italia by doing a Google search. Their prices were better than their competitors, so we thought we&#39;d give it a try. The pizza is VERY good. The sauce is in that happy medium between not too sweet, and not too acidic. The crust is not too doughy, not too thin. The braided rim on the crust is fantastic...doughy but airy at the same time. The cheese has a nice tang to it too. 

Employees (think ownership changed hands very recently, around the time we moved here) have always been very helpful and personable, and the prices are good (we get the 18&#34; extra-large and it comes out to $17 and some change with tax).

I&#39;m glad we discovered this place...and my son the pizza-addict is even happier!"

We have ordered from Roma D&#39;s since they first opened.  They are a good Italian restaurant and mostly do business through carry-out and delivery.  They do have a small eat-in area and then a few tables out front for nice days.  Their pizza is good and so are many of the other items we have had off of their menu.  

The owners used to work there alot and we really liked them but now that they have become established they have some younger employees that work and their service isn&#39;t as great as it was when the owners were there all the time.  They have changed things on the menu a couple times and when we got our food we were a bit surprised that their food tasted different.  I think that they were just trying things out in the beginning to see what worked best for them...they haven&#39;t changed the food in quite a while now, I think!

We have also used them for several parties we have catered and they do a great job...not too expensive either (cheaper than Portillo&#39;s and pretty comparable food...Portillo&#39;s is a bit better on the catering).

They do have special lunch specials and you can buy pizza by the slice during the lunch hour -- it may be all day on that, not sure."

Luckily Los Burritos Tapatios opens early for desayuno, so an early lunch is no prob!

Today was my first visit. I ordered the Lengua Burrito ($6.29) To Go with everything (beans, cheese, lettuce, tomato). Guac or sour cream are .50 extra.

At 10:30a,  there was one occupied table of 2 and one other Take Out order, so it was very slow. Despite this, there were several unbussed/dirty tables. Blech.

My order arrived quickly and I was offered salsa. They included utensils and napkins. (Gracias!)

The weight of my To Go bag was impressive! The burrito itself was about 1/2 meat (again, impressive!) and 1/2 of the other stuff.

It wasn&#39;t soggy like some places, even as leftovers. The lengua was tender but wasn&#39;t as trimmed as I&#39;d have liked, so in the future I&#39;d probably skip it in favor of another meat. The mild salsa had more of a kick than I&#39;d have thought. Duly noted.

We asked her (the cashier) about it and she responded in a rude ass voice, &#34;you have to buy it.&#34; I am pretty sure we don&#39;t. We then asked a different staff member and he was nice enough to offer us the chips and salsa. However, the lady happened to see it and she came to our table and took it away. How rude is that. 

For our second visit, It was a Friday night so the restaurant opens till 3-4 in the morning. However, that was not the case for us. We arrived around 1:45 A.M. We ordered our food and about to sit down, when she came up to us and told us to leave since the place is closing. Excuse me lady, the store hours says 4 A.M.

This is one of the few restaurants, actually the only one around here, that has cecina. I love that meat, its just salty dried meat. Throw some of those tacos on the grill, top them with cilantro, cebolla and lime and I&#39;m good to go.

My friends like their chile relleno tacos and tripitas doradas tacos. The tripitas have to be nice and crispy, otherwise, I guess they&#39;re not as good. I wouldn&#39;t know because I&#39;m not into all that but I wouldn&#39;t mind trying the chile relleno taco, it looks pretty good.  

In case you didn&#39;t know, chile relleno is a stuffed poblano pepper (usually stuffed with cheese and deep fried in a batter) and tripitas are the small intestines of farm animals. Doesn&#39;t that sound so good? (sarcasm)

Regardless, my friends love them here and if you&#39;re into that, you should try them. I&#39;ll stick with my carne asada and cecina tacos.

To this date, I haven&#39;t had such a good steak burrito. Common burritos are typically messy and after the first bite; all the content would separate or pool together, resulting in a different taste with every bite. This burrito was structured by angels or miracle workers because every bite is the exact same. I couldn&#39;t believe it as I was eating. 

They also offered free chips and salsa for dine in customers. It was great. I also had horchata which was good, but mine tasted watered down.

The Mexican rice is the best I have had. They have an amazing salsa selection- I highly recommend the light green. The chicken is never fatty or gross. The beans are delish. I usually get the ground beef and it just has a really good flavor, no clue what spices they put in there.

We ordered a side of chips and salsa and asked to also have guacamole with it as well. The women taking our order asked if we would like the large guacamole serving, which we did. The guacamole was amazing, just how you would expect it to be from a Mexican restaurant. The salsa was spicy, I love spicy food so to me it had a slight kick to it. My sister who does not usually indulge in spicy food got flushed in the face after trying a bite. 

The place was clean. The employees were accomdating. My sister did say something about one of the employees using their bare hands to handle our order of chips but it didn&#39;t bother me.

Steak is definitely the go-to option as the chicken, pastor, etc are forgettable in comparison. The service is great and have been the same as long as I can remember so be sure to drop a couple bucks as a tip if you dine in.

There was a bone (?) in my burrito (no serious- my steak burrito had a bone in it). Big problem there. The burrito was worth 2 stars- but yeah, those beans. Yum.
Maybe the $ is spot on for the &#39;burbs but it was a little pricey if you ask me. Yeah yeah I am a contrarian as far as this joint goes. A lot of 5 stars? I call it group think. No way it gets close. 3 stars cuz refried heaven.

I&#39;ll cut to the chase, I have literally nothing going for me. Nothing. When my parents got my ACT results in high school they told me I was going to be a taxi cab driver at best (nothing against cab drivers, you guys and girls are some of my favorite people in the world. I guess they assumed that was supposed to be demeaning, whatever). Now at 24 I&#39;ve done nothing with my life WHICH BRINGS ME HERE.. TO SPEAK TO ALL MY YELP FRIENDS (I still don&#39;t have any plz help). Anyway, like anyone who hates themselves would do, I looked for a community that would love me for the nobody I am. I went to bars, I asked strangers to befriend me, I considered attending a Planters Peanut convention because apparently that&#39;s a thing, but there was one radiant beacon of light that never left my side.. burritos. Now I am what you might call a burrito connoisseur as I&#39;ve eaten a couple thousand of these in my lifetime. I&#39;ve really had &#39;em all. From fast food burritos to lavish, gourmet burritos - you name it, I&#39;ve manhandled it. Which segues nicely into the real meat of the story (LOL almost made a pun). As fate would have it, 18 year old me stumbled across Los Burritos Tapatios in desperate need of a friend. I walked in, somber and defeated as a man, and after perusing the menu I went to my go-to - a steak burritio with everything and, of course, sour cream (saturated fats really put a smile on my face). The service was great, I was greeted with warm chips and salsa to tide me over until my burrito arrived which came very quickly I might add. The ambiance is comforting, my booth illuminated faintly by the neon lights adorning the front of the restaurant. A few short minutes after placing my order, the waitress rounds the corner and I get a peek of the plate. My heart skips a beat and my palms start sweating - it&#39;s gorgeous. I can faintly see the steam dancing off the top of the tortilla like an advanced meringue class in Santo Domingo. I nearly weep. It&#39;s larger than the burritos I&#39;m used to eating, and has the aesthetic appeal of a handcrafted masterpiece. After a few seconds of blissful admiration, I dive into the experience. The very first bite changed my life forever.. I&#39;m chewing and I experience an overwhelming abundance of endorphins. I&#39;m traveling through space and time and visions of marinated carne asada dance in my head. For the first time in my life I&#39;m in love.. beautiful, unconditional, selfless monogamy. I finished my burrito, paid for my meal, and left a changed person. Approximately 267 visits and 267 burritos later, my lust and infatuation for my muse has not wavered. Every visit brings me closer to self-actualization, and I can finally say I&#39;ve made a real friend in Los Burritos Tapatios. Bless your restaurant and everyone who graces its hallowed halls. If you love burritos, not coming here should be illegal. You&#39;ll thank me later. One day soon I hope to not be a failure but in the meantime, I&#39;ll continue finding solace in 11 inches of tortilla stuffed with steak and cheese."

Was in the area and wanted a quick bite to eat. Saw this place on Yelp so decided to try it out. Nice small place. A bit more than I wanted to pay for a quick taco but it was worth it. Asked the cashier which was better, pork or chicken tacos, she recommended the pork so we got that and a chicken quesadilla. I wanted to try there guacamole and chips but it was 5.99. Woe! Wasn&#39;t trying to spend that much. Anyway, the tacos were great. They do not skimp on the meat, which makes me appreciate the cost a little more. The regular pork taco with lettuce, cheese, and tomatoes was really good. But we both like the pork taco with just onion and cilantro the best. Just wish I had asked for a lime to squeeze a little on it. That would have made it top notch. The Chicken quesadilla was perfect. A lot of chicken with just the right amount of cheese. Their Horchata was just ok, I probably won&#39;t get it again.  If I&#39;m in the area, I will go here again. My husband absolutely loved the food, however, he didn&#39;t like the Horchata, not sweet enough and not enough cinnamon."

I was not sure what to expect, but aww man! I&#39;m talking about DIVE restaurant with fantastic food. I ordered the burrito suizo with chicken, my friend ordered the carne asada, and we ordered the stuffed pepper (I think). Everything was fantastic! Right down to the chips that are just hanging around and salsa.

My burrito was the size of my head and yet I still thought I could finish it in one sitting. I enjoyed it soo much, I decided to take it to go. I know its risky to reheat a burrito, but you know food is good when it tastes just as good on day 2 as it did on day 1.

The place is a pretty standard, authentic-enough Mexican fast food joint: better than average but nothing fancy-schmancy. If you decide to get food from here I&#39;d recommend carrying out: the restaurant itself is pretty small and not especially clean. No matter where we stood waiting for our order the employees acted like we were in their way, and pushed past us several times without a word. The people working behind the counter looked and acted like they&#39;d rather be anywhere but there, but they were polite enough.

The food is of good quality and the burritos are HUGE. The veggie one was just beans, lettuce, tomato, rice, and sour cream. I was a bit disappointed that they didn&#39;t have any peppers or other veggies to throw in it (it was basically a meatless regular burrito). Both the red and green salsas are EXCELLENT - I recommend trying them both.

So:
Ambiance - NO.
Food (and that&#39;s what REALLY matters, right?): YES.

Check it out! Not bad, not bad..."

Los Burritos takes my pick. Coming into the place, it felt like I would be getting more authentic flavor than at El Famous. The woman taking our order barely knew English, so maybe that did the trick. 

When I got my steak torta, it was delicious! Everything tasted clean and barely greasy unlike what you would find at El Famous. Also, the horchata from Los was yummy. And possibly the best part of all, the torta and the horchata only ran me $7 for all the deliciousness. Not bad, Los, not bad.

My burrito was the perfect size, stuffed to perfection (even though I opted out of some things, the overall size didn&#39;t take a hit-- huge plus!), hot with the cheese melted beautifully, and great flavor!

I can get down with pretty much any kind of Mexican food, even if it&#39;s American-ized Mexican like Taco Bell or whatever the heck kind of Mexican you consider Chipotle to be. That being said, of COURSE i was a fan of Los Burritos Tapatios. If you&#39;ve ever tried El Burrito Loco, it reminded me a lot of that, but maybe a touch better? (Oh, I&#39;m truly sorry El Burrito Loco, I know we&#39;re besties and everything...) 

I think their salsa was my favorite that I&#39;ve had so far. It had a little bit of heat (ok, i thought it was extra spicy but i know my palate is really wussy) and a lot of flavor. Nommmmm. Me &amp; my husband ordered a chorizo burrito to split + the chips &amp; salsa and it was plenty of food. I was super excited about the chorizo option! It only cost us about $10 and we were both full, but not &#34;oh my god i ate way too much&#34; full. That being said, the burrito was huuuuuge and I could have made that last 3 meals if I ordered it by myself. 

I didn&#39;t try the steak but my friend said it was chewy. Sad face. I usually order the steak but decided to stay clear so I wasn&#39;t disappointed. I may have to give it a go sometime in hopes that I either disagree or that it was just that particular day.

I first discovered it when my friend ordered me a steak burrito as we were heading to a Halloween party.  I liked it so much, the next day I had to go myself.

The food came piping hot and fresh.  SO much filling and the steak was amazing.  I&#39;m from San Diego where Mexican food is a staple here.  This place has got it down and it&#39;s AUTHENTIC.  For reals, it is comparable to &#34;Rigobertos&#34; back home.

All they need is carne asada fries and I&#39;m legit-ly in San Diego again."

I did not get a burrito. I ordered breakfast instead, huevos a la mexicana con tortilllas de miaz, my favorite...in english now - eggs mexican style (with tomatos, green peppers, &amp; onions) with a side of rice and beans. It was darn good.

The server was nice and the food was out quickly - can&#39;t ask for anything more.

We were craving something fast and cheap and delicious our first night in Lombard. It was super late so not much was open. I&#39;m pleased to report that this joint is open late- and tasty!

We got a taco plate with one carne asada taco and al pastor taco. They were equally delicious! One thing I would change if I could redo this order- I would ask if they could do the tacos &#34;Mexican Style.&#34; Ya know, cilantro and onions instead of iceburg lettuce and a slice of tomato.

Salsa is good! I like it hot hot hot, so I got plenty of their green one. I love salsa way too much and the guy behind the counter didn&#39;t look at me funny when I asked him for more salsa, and then more again :-)

Rice and beans were yummy- so were guac and chips. Price is reasonable.

I absolutely recommend this place!"

It&#39;s not bad by any means, good service and food, just nothing to push it on up to four-star territory.  I could see myself going back, but I don&#39;t think my wife would want to return (she&#39;s kinda picky when it comes to Mexican food, and we usually end up at more of the &#34;casual&#34; Mexican places rather than these &#34;quick&#34; taco stand type places).

Anyway, I liked it and could see myself venturing back for their quick service and fair prices.  Maybe it&#39;s just me, but I feel like a lot of these taco stand places are fairly similar (sort of like a lot of Greek diners are very similar).  I wonder if many of these places are using the same food service vendor for their ingredients."

Wanna talk about the limited seating.... me neither...... Enter the awesome Rice Water or better known as LA ORCHATA!!!!!! ( ta taaaaaa... ) they have nailed it here. With just the right sugar and Cinnamon to make it be the BOOM you need in your mouth as you take a bite out of that Crispy Torta.... Go ahead... don&#39;t be shy.... take another bite; its good.

You will be tempted to order a side &#34; TACO AL PASTOR &#34; DO IT! You will not regret it. Make sure to get that with just cilantro and onions... that&#39;s how its meant to be eaten.

I really like Los Burritos Tapatios but it seems that they forget what customer service is all about.  This is close to my house so I used to go here all the time.  I have to greatly de-rate my review due to the fact that they&#39;ve gotten absolutely cheap.  The food quality is still fine.  They just want to start charging for salsas.  I don&#39;t really see the difference.  If I dine in, they give you all the chips and salsa you can eat for free.  If you carry out, they&#39;ve always supplied an adequate amount of salsa.

$9 for a burrito and Horchata? Come on!

What&#39;s worse, I can go down the street to Burrito Parilla in Downers to pay -LESS- for a better burrito. I was apalled. It&#39;s not a terrible burrito or anything, but not a lot of meat, and not very flavorful meat to boot.

I seriously regreted going as soon as I heard the total. I hoped, however, that I would get a great meal out of it. I got a Chorizo burrito and it was a let-down. The Horchata was by far the most bland I&#39;ve had besides an awful experience in Michigan.

The salsa they serve with their chips is very spicy, even for a spice lover. It did make the burrito taste better though. 

I&#39;m sticking to my joints in Addison or Roselle. Better prices and better food."

Decent tamales (I&#39;d say the second best in Lombard). 
Late night (I&#39;ve been here many-a-post-bar-trips).
Free chips and a really good, hot salsa (yummy!)
Free horchata refills (YES PLEASE!)
Great staff. Working late and surrounded by foolish drunks, they just smile and brush the behavior off. :)
Tastes great sober. (Yep, I&#39;ve been here sober. Tastes just as good)
Mexican Shrimp Cocktail. It&#39;s like a Bloody Mary without the vodka. (You&#39;ll thank me later)."

I would say they have the best staff, though. They work long hours, are always friendly, and do a great job of scaring the riff raff into not causing trouble. 

They make spectacular salsa to pour on your rice and I think the tacos and burritos, etc are good but not over the top great... unless, of course, you&#39;ve got a buzz., in which case they are the bomb.com. And I&#39;m not a superfan of their chile relleno or gauc... which just doesn&#39;t cut it for me flavor wise.  

Ooh, and I have to give them props for the food freshness. They make everything to order and the place is always super clean.

Again, if you&#39;re out on the town, the bar has closed and you need to nurse what may be turning into a hangover, this is a great place to stop for a bite but it&#39;s not a place I&#39;d crave if my sobriety is on the straight and narrow.

I had someone pick up a order I called in late one night 
I have been there before as well. Not that Happy.
The person I had pickup for me was shorted out moneys perhaps that they came from the Bar in the strip there. Hummmm
Plus the order was not as I asked for over the phone.
Too top it off there a bone in my steak taco.
As most folks know yes they do use a lot of dried out dark chicken.
They love the microwave as well which makes the shells hard and chewy.

The wife and I have had this many times as a weekend lunch, a quick dinner after work or a late night (early morning) meal after a night out. I know from personal experience that after a late night at the bars if you ask nicely they may let you go behind the counter and roll your own burrito. Now that&#39;s customer service!!
 
Between my wife and I we have had tacos to the carne asada, and everything in between. Their chips are fresh and warm and the salsa has just the right amount of kick. Not to mention the chips and salsa are free.

Despite being deep in the burbs of Chicago where most things close at 10pm, LBT is open until 2am (and 4am on weekends). The carne asada burrito was made fresh, everything from the meat being grilled on demand, and the steak really kicked a**... so delicious.

Its definitely authentic, I&#39;ll give you that, and maybe I just caught them on an off day...but over $9 for what I got (burrito and a soda) and the fact that I had to wait almost 1/2 an hour in line was ridiculous.  There is both sit down and take out options here and most of the people who were sitting and came in after me got served before I did.  I got a steak burrito and it had an authentic flavor but was overloaded with sour cream when I asked them for &#34;just a little&#34;  and there was too much grizzle or something in the meat that I had to spit out after chewing it for an hour.

This restaurant used to be all about class and excellent cuisine when it came to their prime rib and seafood buffet. If you wanted to treat someone to an amazing dinner, we would come here but after our visit yesterday, we can&#39;t say that anymore. This restaurant is located inside the Hilton in Lisle IL very close to the 88 highway near Warrenville road. You can expect to pay $40-50 per person for the prime rib and seafood buffet which includes mussels, clams, crab legs, lots of different types of shrimp, and other seafood dishes. 

This buffet is now pitiful. It&#39;s really sad to see. We were beyond shocked but also sad that it has declined so much here. 

Just to give you an example: their dessert table used to include a full large chocolate fountain with six or more options to dip. Yesterday, they literally had some strange pot with melted chocolate sitting there and then some melted caramel in another pot. It looked so sad. 

The taste of the ratatouille scallop pasta was beyond subpar. The presentation of the dishes was below standard quality especially considering you are indulging at $40-50 a person. 

We are sad to see such a place decline. We have come here for so many years including their Mother&#39;s Day brunch but at this point, we can&#39;t trust that they will provide the same class and quality they did many years ago. I am sad for them. It&#39;s like seeing your favorite movie star but after their decline into a life of misery and substance abuse. You just can&#39;t see them the same."

Wait.

Champagne brunch.

Need I say more?

No, probably not...but I will. We met some friends and their little one here for Sunday brunch, having heard EXCELLENT things and Allgauers did not disappoint. 

We were seated in a side banquet room set for brunch, which was perfect considering the little guy, who had some space to roam. 

The champagne was flowin&#39; fast and loose (in a respectable, we&#39;re-totally-grown-ups-enjoying-a-fancy-brunch sort of way). Our server was absolutely wonderful, as my glass was only empty once...and it was quickly refilled. 

I started (as I tend to start brunch) with all my favorite breakfast foods. Eggs Benedict (YUM), a biscuit with gravy (not bad, though not my fave at this brunch), bacon and...cheese. Obviously. 

The cheese display was one of the best I&#39;ve seen since my days as a catering manager when the chef would create these stunning exotic cheese trays with colorful and flavorful cheeses. I was impressed.

I followed up with a seafood plate (in which the BF decided it was time to move a chair away from me.) Crab legs, raw oysters smoked salmon, and poached salmon. (Can you see the happy-dance smile on my face?)

Then it was time to try the salads. I opted for a papaya and walnut salad, an avocado and pear salad, the Allgauers salad and some fresh fruit. All were absolutely lovely. Oh and more cheese. Obviously.

By the time I was ready for dessert, I was stuffed, but couldn&#39;t keep myself away from the chocolate fountain, the key lime pie or the chocolate covered toffee. 

Verdict? 

See you next week?"

allgauers-lisle,Derrick T.,_qRV6YI3wm6hF0SF-2z8ng,"Woodridge, IL",1,1,0,125,23,-VhBEoCOvEgL3jLXIHjEWg,3.0,2012-08-05,"Spectacular spread for brunch... seriously, there&#39;s so many varieties here that even if you ate a small bite of everything they had to offer... you&#39;d barely be able to go back for seconds.  And the quality was pretty tasty on most items, so overall was impressed.  As a quick note, their website menu hasn&#39;t been updated since last year (2011), so the price of the Sunday brunch is now $39 per person.

The downsides - 
1.  Automatic 20% tip.  I don&#39;t know if this was because we&#39;re a party of six (seriously, not that hard to serve, especially since we&#39;re serving our own food) but I was severely disappointed in the waiter telling me the tip has been added to find that it was 20% gratuity.  That&#39;s pretty presumptuous.

2.  Logistical placement of the buffet.  You have to walk out of the restaurant towards the exit, to enter a hallway to get to the brunch buffet.  My guess is that the buffet has probably grown significantly and thus they were no longer able to host within the restaurant like they used to... however that means walking past people waiting to get into the restaurant, through crowds, etc.  While I don&#39;t mind a walk to get some food and stretch my legs/stomach to get food, it&#39;s cumbersome to walk in and out of the restaurant each time.

3.  There was still food on my fork when I first sat down.  Yes, it was that dried on crusted kind of food that happens when you run it through the large restaurant machinery dishwashers, so it was probably heated enough to kill anything on it... but seriously, at $39 a person, shouldn&#39;t attention to details such as clean silverware be standard?  I put it in the middle of the table and didn&#39;t use the fork... but there&#39;s obviously a lack of attention to some details at the service level (we were one of the first tables there for the brunch).

Nearly all food items were good if not very good.  Eggs benedict slightly overdone (everyone prefers their yolks set differently though), and the biscuits didn&#39;t have any rise to them (flat biscuit for gravy??)  but otherwise, everything was very enjoyable.

Verdict:  I&#39;d consider going back... seriously, the food and service was enjoyable, but it&#39;s tacky to assume a 20% tip, especially at a buffet style brunch.  That left a terrible after taste in my mouth after the good food I just had..."

We have always had good food and good service. It was a shock when, after all this time, we had bad service and disappointing food on the same day. Normally I would give it five stars, but today it gets only three.
I think our waiter must be new to the job. He did show up to take our drink order promptly. And he delivered the drinks. But then he disappeared for a long long time. He was gone so long we sent out a search party - actually one person who went to the reception desk to inquire about him. He did finally show up to take our order. But he was mostly absent that evening. And I will note the place was not crowded.
In the past I have enjoyed many items from their menu. (The &#34;Chicken Chop&#34; is rightly famous.) But on this occasion I tried something new, the Chicken Breast Medallions. What a disappointment. The dish consisted of some chunks of chicken breast, a bunch of pasta, some vegies and a thin almost tasteless sort of broth."

Don&#39;t get me wrong, the Sunday buffet was GOOD, but it wasn&#39;t great enough to justify the $35 price tag.  That&#39;s hefty!!!  I don&#39;t eat/drink enough to make up for that kind of expense.  If I stayed there the whole day, MAYBE.

However, we made reservations for six, and they only had it for five.  No big deal, but the hostess made this big production about it.

Then, we are seated, and my friend (who has a one-year old) says she doesn&#39;t need a high chair.  I have never seen this one-year old use one, and she sits just fine in the seat. It&#39;s never been a problem.  However, the second she left, the waiter came back over and asked me no less than THREE TIMES if he could get her a high chair.  Dude, I don&#39;t parent other peoples&#39; kids.  She&#39;s fine without one.  Leave it alone!

Right after we were seated, though, I noticed both my glass and my daughter&#39;s glass had lipstick on them(see picture).  Disgusting.  I pointed it out to the waiter, and we got no apology or anything.  He just took them away.  Ew.  What else wasn&#39;t clean??

The brunch always lasts between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. and there is plenty of seating to be had by all.  We always get the time that we want (there&#39;s usually no problem getting the reservation that you want because there&#39;s ample seating).  

The brunch buffet is absolutely amazing.  There is a waffle bar, omelette bar, breakfast items, lunch items, dinner items, appetizers/finger foods - they literally have anything and everything.  You really need to fast for days before you go to this buffet.  The food is good and gourmet.  This brunch also includes all of the champagne/mimosa you can possibly handle.  This year (compared to years past) we noticed they weren&#39;t as generous with the champagne so it was a bit hard to get someone to come back and refill (refill anything, actually).  However, the brunch was still excellent.  

And the dessert - awesome.  There were little cups made of chocolate filled with deliciousness, pies, cakes, baked Alaska - everything.  The dessert table was absolute insanity.  There were chocolate covered pieces of fruit and anything else anyone could imagine.  I highly recommend the brunch for anyone looking to have a good time out on a holiday or Mother&#39;s Day.  We always have a good time and the food is unbeatable.  It&#39;s about $35-$45/person depending on the occasion, but the price is totally worth it."

I have dined here MANY times and enjoyed the Sunday Brunch as well as the Seafood/Prime Rib Buffet on Friday night..  It is peaceful and quiet - enabling you to speak, comfortably with your guests... and I find it a very romantic place. Have celebrated 3 birthdays there, as well..  Service was very good and the food is always wonderful.  My only suggestion is that they change the menu as it has stayed very much the same for at least 2 years.  Would never hesitate to come back or recommend this restaurant to anyone. Always a very enjoyable experience..."

The place was way less than half full with a largely older crowd finishing up their meals. Our experience was rather mixed.

The service was excellent. Our waiter was very attentive. He offered samples of wine when the group could not decide what they wanted. Water glasses were kept full -  a big deal for me. At the end of the meal, he brought over extra wedding cake left over from the wedding held at the hotel.

The menu is a rather smallish traditional fine dining menu - which is fine by me. There are many dishes that I could have chosen from.  I enjoyed my small Fillet Mignon. I ordered it medium rare and came out closer to medium, but was still very good. Mashed potatoes were ok and mixed vegetables were fresh and not overcooked.

My wife enjoyed the halibut, but her vegetables were cold.  One other in party had a meal that was served room temperature. Another ordered the duck and found it excellent.  High mark for presentation on all the meals. 

We were seated right by the opening to the restaurant.  With no door separating it from the hotel&#39;s conference and banquet areas we could hear the music from a wedding reception in the background as the ballroom was just outside the opening to the restaurant.  I actually found it oddly entertaining - I&#39;m sure the group found me doing the letters to YMCA with my arms at dinner a highlight of the evening.   

Mandatory 20% tip for group of 6 or more leaves no room to vote with your pocketbook on the service. This policy should be changed to15 or at least 18%.

All in all a rather uneven experience. a Rating of two seemed a bit low but I thought the experience was closer to &#34;Meh, I&#39;ve experienced better&#34; than &#34;A-OK&#34;. Multiple dishes served cold drove me to the lower rating, Might go back to give it another try as I suspect the cold food may have been an anomaly."

The biggest drawback of this place is the name- when asked where I was taking the wife and littles for mother&#39;s day, I had to resort to saying &#34;That place in the Hilton-Lisle.&#34;

My wife is pregnant, and after eating here, I made the mistake saying, &#34;Well, honey, now we both resemble beached whales. What a meal!&#34; Not very tactful, but probably gets my pt across. For $35 per person, their champagne brunch is of very high quality. The array of food is large- kind of a &#34;if we don&#39;t have it, then you don&#39;t need it&#34; feel. That does not effect the overall quality though. The prime rib, waffle bar, and seafood lounge were all whoop-whoop worthy. I felt so nouveau-upper part of the upper middle of the middle class while sipping champagne and eating oysters. The salads and fresh fruit were great for the kids. The dessert was perhaps the best. Probably 30 difft varieties, all excellent. Yes, all. I mean all. 

The service was fast, friendly, and excellent. The champagne will flow as long as you keep putting your glass out there. If a Sunday of heavy drinking is your thing, then join the club. And come to brunch with me. I ate and ate and ate. Then i was hungover by 9pm. What a mother&#39;s day!!!!!"

We arrived and were seated fairly quickly, then our waiter arrived who appeared to speak very little English and struggled communicating with us.  This didn&#39;t seem like it would be a problem until we were ordering and I asked about a couple items on the menu, neither of which he knew anything about.  So we ordered and our food was good, but not excellent.  Then at the end I had both a flyer from their website (saying if you brought it in you would receive a free bottle of house wine or a dessert) and a $20 Yelp certificate.  The waiter looked at them both like I was crazy then took them over where him, his manager, and three other employees deliberated for about ten minutes.  He finally came back and told me that they would take the flyer, but not my certificate.  This made me a little angry because there was an extra menu inserted into the regular menu saying explicitly that coupons and promotions only weren&#39;t valid on the Valentine&#39;s Menu, so I purposely ordered off the regular menu.  I went up to discuss this with the manager who insisted I was wrong and that they don&#39;t take those on holidays.  I then showed her the writing printed on the Yelp certificate which says &#34;For the owner&#34; and stated that at the time of redemption no additional restrictions may be imposed on this, which finally forced her to honor it.  Once I got my bill I noticed that they had charged both of us for the large portions, despite the fact that we ordered the moderate, and an additional $3 charge each for soup even though it was included with the purchase of an entree.  I didn&#39;t even bother arguing this because I wanted to get out of there.  Overall an extremely poor experience and probably the worst customer service I have ever experienced at this price point."

And, while everything here is very well prepared, very high quality, and very fresh, I&#39;m just not a big fan of the all you can eat brunch buffet format.  On the one hand, you can sample a huge variety of different dishes.  On the other, after two trips to the buffet room, you&#39;re ready to make a hasty retreat to the vomitorium, and you end up comatose and supine on your couch for the rest of the day. And that&#39;s without a single glass of the bubbly.

The service is good, but if you ask for de-caf coffee, for instance, or something that exceeds the terrestrial, you ask again and again and again until you either give up, or your request is finally satisfied.

Setting aside my Tryptophan hypersensitivity and/or inability to engage in binge/purge, this is an excellent brunch venue.  The dining room is very nice-well appointed, nice view, and easy to find (it is in a hotel). And the food is excellent.  A few of the notable items included the prime rib, the oyster on the ha&#39; shell and the peel and eat shrimp, the smoked salmon and trout, the made to order omelets, and the outstanding dessert table.  This would be a fantastic choice if you just spent a year in a turkish prison subsisting on water and gruel or if you want to put the feed bag on in a big way."

I have to admit for a $35.00 champagne brunch buffet I was impressed! A huge variety of food, and more than enough dessert choices for even the pickiest of patrons. I probably had $35.00 worth of orange juice and champagne alone.
Make sure to go when you are hungry. I found enough to fill 3 plates full and a fourth half way.
It was the only meal I ate all day so I made sure it was worth it.

It was!"

The prime rib roast is cooked perfectly and is seasoned just right. The seafood is good, although my wife said the oysters were nothing spectacular. IF you are a lover of sweet tables you are going to be in heaven. Every time I have been here since they have had baked Alaska. 

Their cold lines are great. Scallop and shrimp salads. A crab salad that went on my plate on all trips (a definite must try for crab lovers). It is expensive but when you see the amount of food prepared and the quality you will know you are getting a good deal."

The artichoke dip looks good but is mostly salt and the bread is day old burnt toast.... not appealing at all.  The shrimp bisque has only 2 halves pieces of shrimp, which would be okay if the bisque was good but its just salty broth.  A bisque should have dry sherry, brandy, or Cognac.  THAT&#39;S WHAT MAKES A BISQUE!!!  None in this, just salty broth, no body,  The bananas beignet however, is all that you will ever imagine in amazing culinary deliciousness!!!!

We were scouting possible places to host a family gethering for Thanksgiving lunch (since Braxton&#39;s in Oak Brook was closed, and their new location won&#39;t be open until 2012) and this place was recommended by a coworker.

There was a huge selection at the buffet; very impressive.  Some of the basics were good: coffee, deserts, bacon, etc., but the rest was mediocre at best.  I love shrimp but the shrimp smelled, which worried me a bit.  The Prime Rib was tough and dry.  Some other dishes had unpleasant seasoning surprises for my wife and she ended up getting sick during the ride home.

So, the selection was huge, the quality was mixed, the food was mediocre, and the price was very expensive.  We all agreed that this was definitely NOT worth the price.  We wouldn&#39;t choose to eat here even at a lower price.  I&#39;d give it 2 stars just for the food but had to lower it to 1 star when I factor in the unjustifiable high price.

Ate here this morning for their Sunday Champagne Brunch.  We&#39;ve gone to the same place too many times, so I spent about an hour searching for another place last night.  It is so hard to find places in the suburbs that have bottomless mimosas and a buffet!  This place came up on most of my searches, so we decided we had to try it.  If you check in, you get 10% off your purchase and there is a $10 for $20 voucher you can purchase on here.  Not sure how long it will be offered, so get it now!  They start serving at 10:30, so we made reservations.  There were already people in line when we arrived, but we were all seated within 5 minutes.  We were there for about 2 hours and never felt rushed to leave for the rush of people coming into the restaurant.  They have 2 dining areas.  If you get there early you can get the outside view.  They other dining area is in the banquet hall where the buffet line is located.  We got to sit in the area with a view.  It was very cozy and romantic.  Now for the food.....There were so many choices I was overwhelmed with what I wanted to eat!  It will probably take 3 or 4 times dining there to try everything on that buffet spread!  I only tried one thing that I didn&#39;t like, and that was my own fault for trying dill cream shrimp when I don&#39;t really like dill.  If you visit the website it tells you everything that is offered at the buffet.  And man, do they keep those champagne glasses full.....I have no idea how much we drank, but we left pretty tipsy.  As soon as our glasses were half full, a guy showed up with a bottle to top em off!  Awesome job with taking away dirty plates as well.  Wonderful experience!  Will definitely come back the next Sunday I have off work."

I don&#39;t know if that the same as the lobster. Don&#39;t mess around with that one-it&#39;s the best. Was suprised at how inexpensive it was for all that- under $20!

I didn&#39;t even have enough room to fit in their massive selection of dessert sweets which includes a chocolate fountain!

As for the hot stuff, they had fresh prime rib, swordfish, NY strip (really good by the way), and other honorable mentions.

The buffet varied daily and included healthy options such as fish daily, and good salads which weren&#39;t boring - shrimp with couscous was my favorite. Other dishes I enjoyed were mahi-mahi with mango sauce, chicken breast in capers, and lox and bagels.

I think it cost around $35+ for each person, which included the full buffet and champagne.  It&#39;s a great value actually, in terms of the selection of seafood, prime rib, and desserts.   What other buffet have Baked Alaska on their dessert tables?

Seafood fans should have their fill of shrimp, scallops, oysters (on the half shell), and even snow crab - though the crab was rather small, but hey, it&#39;s a buffet!  

Service is ultra fast - your plates are cleaned in a blink, and drinks refilled with a snap.

allgauers-lisle,Johnny G.,1ByswKsCK_Ca2THpqfAVRQ,"Mt Juliet, TN",0,1,0,10,46,4ESga5DofOsquZR7F9EEdg,5.0,2009-11-26,"The Background: 
* Thanksgiving brunch 2009 - our reservation was at noon.
* My wife and boys (8 and 5) for a party of 4
* $37.95; $14.95 for kids ages 4-12; free for kids under age 4
* I&#39;m a professional chef with very discriminating tastes consider my reviews as &#34;insider&#34; and based on what I know about the food business.

The Good:
* valet parking - complimentary (don&#39;t forget to tip though)
* Lot&#39;s of staff everywhere you look!
* Champagne offered when we entered and approached the hostess stand to check in.
* We sat almost immediately - although the line was confusing since we went in through the Allgauer&#39;s door which was a mistake. (use the main hotel entrance).
* Big buffet with a wide variety including omelet station, seafood area, carved prime rib and turkey, full dessert bar, kids buffet section, full breakfast station, ice carvings, and all well stocked and attended to.
* 3 waitstaff surrounded our table when we sat. 1 with orange juice, 1 with champagne, and our head waiter to explain the meal.
* Drinks are included in price-tag.
* No skimping on quality and variety - included in buffet: shrimp cocktail, crab legs, fresh oysters, smoked salmon,Prime rib, Roast turkey,  multiple seafood salads, fresh fruit and vegetable crudites, poached salmon, eggs Benedict, beef tenderloin, leg of lamb, corvina, pork loin, mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, stuffing, gravy, au jus, horseradish sauce, mushroom ravioli, rice, Baked Alaska, key lime pie, chocolate turtles, and so much more....
* Wait staff was attentive and all of our glasses were kept full.
* Wait staff is helpful and concerned.
* Plates were cleared quickly and all requests at the table were quickly followed up on.
* All food was well prepared and flavorful (considering this was a buffet).  I only had one item that I did not like (see below).
* My children were happily accommodated.  We all felt welcomed as the staff we came in contact with made an extra effort to help us feel comfortable.
* Relatively nice ambiance (again considering this is a buffet) we were sat in a banquet room but all tables were clothed and each had a flower. ( did I mention the ice carvings?)
* Lot&#39;s of staff everywhere!!!!

The Bad:
* We didn&#39;t have time to taste everything!
* Prime rib was just a little ( I stress LITTLE - remember I&#39;m a chef) tough and hardly seasoned - I would recommend the chef cook the beef at a slightly lower temp for a longer time and cook it with a nice salt crust. 
* Because this is a buffet there is not much intimacy here so don&#39;t expect to feel like you&#39;re at home. 
* Big number signs on each table made me feel like I was sitting down at a sandwich shop - The number signs were not subtle and it was a little detail that the hotel could have done without.
* Bread was at the dessert station and I wished the rolls were warm and maybe served at the table.  I  had a difficult time finding the bagels which should have been right next to the smoked salmon.  Again, just a minor detail.  
* Kids buffet was a little weak - chicken fingers, fries, pizza, French toast sticks, etc...  a lot of processed foods here but my kids stayed away and then devoured the shrimp cocktail while I had to limit the crab legs as i didn&#39;t want to spend my entire brunch cracking shells for the kids.
* the shrimp and scallop pasta in lobster sauce was a nice touch but when you hold shrimp at high temperatures it breaks down and scallops get tough.  Shrimp and scallops should have been cooked to order.
* Ceasar salad was good but the dressing was placed on the lettuce and by the time I got to it the greens were soggy.
* The flan was eggy and flavorless. This was the only food I had that I did not like.

The rest of my review:
* All food that we had was well prepared - good flavor combinations and lots of variety.  We didn&#39;t try everything but we made a good attempt.  There were only two minor flaws that could have been avoided (mentioned above) but really you can&#39;t beat the service and food at this price.
* This is a buffet so don&#39;t expect a 5 star meal here.  If you&#39;re looking for a good Thanksgiving meal at a reasonable price Allgauer&#39;s is your place. 
* The bathrooms are very clean and well kept  (usually a good indication of how the kitchen run).
* Overall my family was very happy with this meal and we would highly recommend Allgauer&#39;s buffet for a special occasion based on our Thanksgiving meal.
*Kudo&#39;s to the staff who pulled this off. I estimate that the hotel served a couple thousand people.  And big compliments to the chef!"

So first the good. 

It has great pizza options. You can legit ask for any type of pizza and thats really cool in my book. 

Cheap easy price, for the price and unlimited pizza its great. 

Dessert was spot on. Had good taste, very creative pizza dessert.

You can custom order pizzas to your table.

Now the bad...

Very loud environment with tons of kids rolling around. Not a place you want to have a quiet dinner or lunch. 

Disrespectful chef. My girlfriend went up to ask some questions on their smores dip... and fella gave some attitude with little to no answers. I wouldnt ask him for anything again. With all that attitude and hes not even latina. So forget asking him questions. 

Pizza was at most OK. Crust was soggy, felt soft. I like a crunchy pizza. Hell even deep dishes have a certain crunch to it. Was not my favorite in my opinion. I was able to fold the pizza 4 times before i could eat it. Definitely not cool. 

Their workers didnt clean up the plates, after a half hour i had 4 plates that were still on our table. So didnt really appreciate that. They got other customers but failed to see us... 

So thats my review, Good luck!"

Their pizza reminds me a lot of Sbarro&#39;s or Pizza Now.  A little extra salty with chewy crust.  While I avoid buffets in general, I might consider going to this location because I already know my kids will definitely eat CiCi&#39;s anytime."

We know we get what we pay for. Since we&#39;re vegetarian they would give us veggie pizzas at our table.  Today the Indian manager who has always served us well refused to make us any pizzas besides the cheese they had in the buffet. This was probably because they  were really short staffed. His rude and aggressive behavior made us decide not to come back again. If they made special pizzas for you in the past, don&#39;t expect them to from now on. We&#39;ll be going to a different Cicis in the future."

2 employees spoke the entire time in some other (indian language). Ever yelling to each other in the kitchen laughing. 

I asked if they could make a custom pizza they refused. When a different employee aproached the counter I ask a second time for a custom pizza. I was told no a second time. The employee immediately started speaking  in another language to the first person who told me no and started laughing. I told the employee in the past when ever I&#39;ve asked no one ever said no was there a problem? His immediate response was you can choose from what we have made. Then laughed again. 

I find it EXTREMELY Rude when someone knows English, however intentionally speaks another language in front of you. I felt direspected by having multiple employees more or less laugh in my face. Had I not had a 7 year old with me I&#39;m sure I would have given them a whole lot of 4 letter words. 

I&#39;ll never go back to this location!!! I had another customer tell me &#34;they are always @ss holes here, I only come here because   it&#39;s close and cheap.

Seriously, when my kid gets to be of eating out each, we are totally doing CiCi&#39;s! How can you beat a meal for $2.99?!?!?  They have a little salad bar (lettuce, veggies, olives and a selection of dressings), several different types of pizza and cheesey bread and cinnamon rolls and brownies for dessert!  The price is $4.99 for adults, plus a drink...of course the hubs and I would never come here with just the two of us, but I definately recommend it! This location is well managed and very clean.

EVERYTHING is peanut-safe which awesome for those peanut-allergy families!

This place is dirt-cheap and it&#39;s all you can eat pizza.  There are salad and pasta options available, but it&#39;s very limited.

The macaroni &amp; cheese pizza is my favorite!  It appeals to the picky eater that loves carbs and comfort food.

Try the pizzas you haven&#39;t had before, otherwise you will be disappointed.  Plain cheese, pepperoni, etc. can be skipped.  Have a slice of chicken alfredo or buffalo chicken instead.

Don&#39;t see what you want?  Just ask them, and they will make a fresh one for you!  Pizzas rotate quickly, so it&#39;s usually only 2-3 minutes before what you want will be served.

Also a small selection of desserts like brownies to polish off your meal.

If you don&#39;t want to take your kids to McDonald&#39;s, or pay for a children&#39;s meal at Chili&#39;s, then Cici&#39;s is a great middle of the road option.  My friend and I also really like this place even though neither of us has kids."

They recently started serving Chicken Wings and Beer. Nice combination is a buffet restaurant. 

We will get $1 off whenever we complete a survey from www.cicisvisit.com and note the number t the end of the survey.  The cool thing we can order a special Pizza in a buffet. As nice as you see. Never seen such a practice in a buffet restaurant. 

I order Chicken Pizza with 1 topping and white sauce. My kid loves the chicken they use for topping. So i always order that one. They have good pastas and dessert. Good enough to try different varieties. The pizzas in the buffet were maintained hot always.

The dessert pizzas and browies are absolutely delicous.  Oh and you can ask them to make a custom pizza for you that has any topping(s) you can possibly think of.  

Now mind you this is far from gourmet food! But, for the price it&#39;s hard to complain.  Drinks are extra, but my daughter and I typically end up drinking water.  Also, this new location is fairly clean.  The seating is somewhat cramped in my opinion - and it can get really crowded in here on weekends.  So it&#39;s best to try and go when they first open if you can (that&#39;s when the food is the freshest as well).  They do have a little gameroom in the back - but it&#39;s nothing to brag about honestly.  Also, the bathrooms are clean - which is a huge plus.

I really like their optional side sauces and I&#39;m a St. Louis style rib guy.

About ten minutes off Route 53 and worth the digression imo. Ugly strip mall, parking can be tight. There are a couple picnic tables out front with another eight inside.
Not fancy, and it smells wonderful inside.

Parking was a bit of a drag, but I would have happily walked a lot farther to make it inside to smell that smokey goodness. 

We were overwhelmed by our choices, but after staring at the menu board for far too long, we did make some decisions. My favorites included the pulled pork, the Apple bourbon BBQ sauce and the smokey bacon potato salad. The hot links were good too, but a little different from what I anticipated. They are a BYOB establishment which I don&#39;t feel we see much of here in the burbs, so that was interesting.

My wife and I hosted a rehearsal dinner for 80 people when our son got married. We are not from the Chicago area and needed to find a caterer for a pig roast. The online ratings for Steamboat BBQ sold me and we decided to go ahead with John and his crew at Steamboat after a couple phone calls. 

From the outset, they were extremely helpful and responsive. The day of the event was hectic--and John and Joe were incredibly  accomoating. They arise on time, set up quickly and even helped out with our non-food set up. In fact, they even ran out and found some baskets to facilitate a last-minute need.

And the food was absolutely perfect. Tenderly smoked pork and chicken. The bacon potato alad was other-worldly. And the bread pudding was worth the trip to Chicago all by itself! What&#39;s more, it was very reasonably priced.

Nice, local place, pleasant staff, and a plethora of BBQ sauces. We brought collectively seven sauces, but initially carried four to our table. Our rankings/favorites (top to fourth favorite) hot diggity dog, firebox hot, Apple bourbon, spicy vinegar. 

Each of us had the three meats: ribs, brisket, rib tips. And he had brisket, pulled pork, catfish. And two sizes each: I had Mac and cheese and Smokey bacon potato salad and he had beans and sweet potato fries.

Opinions/recommendations from me: get the rib tips, get two orders if you must, and the potato salad and Mac and cheese bites are heaven. My boyfriend loved the brisket. The beans had a hint of a sweetness or bourbon to it, and the fries filling with cinnamon on it. Try all of the sauces and find your favorite. Get and try all of the root beers. We tried these: butterscotch, salted caramel, sasaparilla, and a vanilla creme soda. Favorites are the salted caramel and vanilla creme (even though it&#39;s not a root beer)

We ordered the 3 meat BBQ combo dinner with pulled pork, brisket, and the pork hot link. In addition to your choice of 3 meats, you get two sides and white bread. Our sides were fries and the corn. We also ordered a side of the beans. Overall prices were reasonable. The side of beans was a little expensive, but the meat combo was only 15.

Pulled pork: 3/5 it was a little dry but still had a great flavor.
Brisket: 5/5 by far the best meat we had while eating here. It was super juicy, had a great flavor, good crust, and a good portion.
Pork Hot Link: 4/5 super good flavor with a little kick at the end.

Beans: 2/5 we both decided the beans tasted a little weird. Very sweet and apple flavored. 
Corn: 3/5 underwhelming but good flavor
Fries: 5/5 amazing. Perfect complement to the brisket. Good flavor and didn&#39;t even need ketchup.

Steamboat has plenty of sauces to try. We tried the firebox hot, Apple bourbon, and the butlers tribute. Our favorite was the firebox hot. It had a lot of flavor and a good kick towards the end.

The owner stopped by towards the end of our meal to make sure the food was good and ended up spending time talking to us. Great experience. Would definitely come back."

That being said I would maybe rate their food as a few points below other locations I&#39;ve tried. Don&#39;t take this as a bad thing. The food was tasty as heck. I just probably wouldn&#39;t make it my first choice if I really wanted BBQ. Maybe second or third.
But in any case I only had the brisket dinner so maybe not the best sampling of everything they have. I enjoyed their sweet potato fries. The bacon potato salad was also good. The brisket was tender and juicy. My only gripe is the portion size was kinda small next to other places based on what I paid. 
If you visit they have a few BBQ sauces you can choose from. I tried the Butlers Tribute and Apple Bourbon. The tribute was more akin to normal BBQ sauce while the apple one was sweeter. 
Also as an added bonus they have sweet tea!

I found this via the Yelp community, thanks for recommending this! 

It gave Q&#39;s in Naperville (my favorite BBQ place) some pretty good competition.

I ordered a pulled chicken and tried the various sauces. The meat was very juicy and seems like very good quality, the portions were generous and left satisfied. My sides were fries and potato salad. Im pretty picky about potato salad and HATE it if it tastes too much like mayo, this one was perfect. I wasnt overwhelmed by mayo. 

The seating area was very small and we were very lucky we came in when we did. A quick rush came in after us and noticed people were having trouble finding a seat. I really liked that I could see the meat being prepared while I ordered.

Went here for dinner, ordered half slab of the St. Louis style ribs with beans and cole slaw. I generally prefer St. Louis ribs because they are normally more meaty and more fatty. However, these ribs were dry and tough, like eating beef jerky on a bone. Very disappointed. They had plenty of smoke flavor, but were overcooked. 

The underwhelming un-originality of the sides made the whole meal a bust. The beans were literally Bush&#39;s out of the can with a few spices. Nothing special. The cole slaw was nearly identical to Jewel&#39;s deli cole slaw. Again, no originality in the recipes.

To complete my disappointment, my meal cost about $20. Not worth it. Sorry, guys. This is just below average BBQ."

I&#39;m glad the manager invited me to return. I&#39;ll be back."

Not easy to find good BBQ in the suburbs and this place has just made itself well worth the drive. Briscuit was rather lean and had some amazing smoke rings.  Burnt ends were incredibly flavorful. Had the fries and cornbread as sides.    Fries were fresh cut and crispy, cornbread was rather dry...  No poultry offering except wings, but if your a beef or pork fan you&#39;ll like this place. They have several different sauces all of which are rather tasty. Big reason for 4 stars is the place is a bit small and they only have two high chairs....so if you&#39;re going with a little one during busy times, be prepared to have him/her on your lap."

There are some highlights and some misses for sure.  They were doing a catering order.  The first thing I noticed when I walked in was a huge hotel pan filled with chicken sitting out uncovered for what had to be 15 minutes.  They finally wrapped it but it remained out at room temperature for our entire stay.  

The ribs were ok.  I didn&#39;t really like the rub.  They have several sauces.  The mustard was the best.  The others were average at best.  The pulled pork is terrific and was the star of my meal for sure.  The slaw was cooked in it&#39;s dressing and I didn&#39;t like it but the beans were ok.  

It&#39;s a nice enough place and the staff was interested in how we liked our meal.  I think if I didn&#39;t have the world of BBQ experience, I might have given them a better rating but I&#39;ve had a lot better in BBQ country."

It looks like there&#39;s a pile of stuff/junk to your right as you walk in that has just been forgotten about.

That&#39;s what I mainly have to say about this place. We love the burnt ends, but you have to order early!

I have driven by this place on my way to/from work since it opened in 2014. I smelled its goodness, yet it took almost 2-years to finally try it.  

I walked in and was greeted by a nice crew and a wonderful smoky aroma. I said that I loved BBQ and used to live Texas. The man behind the grill turned around said, &#34;order the burnt tips and beef brisket meal.&#34; So I did and had a bottle of Sioux City Root Beer.

I got the bender burger, which is a burger patty with pulled pork on top. You could tell just by looking at both that they are quality meat, and it was a fantastic sandwich. NOT the gooey cooked-in-sauce excuse for pulled pork most places serve; it looks like it was freshly pulled, and it&#39;s great even without sauce. The cajun fries were very good as well. Natural cut fries, skin-on, just the way they should be. I love that they offer different fry options.

 The rib tips were out of this world and it would be a sin to put sauce on them. 

I only got to try the apple bourbon and butler&#39;s tribute, but I got them mixed up, so all I can say is that they were both great. They both seemed to have a mild heat that kind of sneaks up on you, which I really liked. 

I plan on trying everything the joint has to offer as soon as possible.

The reasons it&#39;s not 5 are: 1) it&#39;s not perfect,  2) I haven&#39;t had all their sides &amp; meats yet, 3) they have Diet Pepsi instead of Diet Coke (still acceptable but not ideal) and 4) Their sweet potato fries come out overdone &amp; have cinnamon &amp; sugar on them instead of salt &amp; pepper.   

We&#39;ve been here 3x over the last few years.  It&#39;s one of our most favorite BBQ joints.  The reason it&#39;s only been 3x is that it&#39;s about a 1.5 hr drive round trip, given lights and traffic and we&#39;re seldom in the area while hankering BBQ.  When we&#39;ve been there, we have had  their pulled pork, brisket, smoked bacon &amp; pulled chicken.  All are outstanding!!  I also LOVE thier apple bourbon and butler sauces.   I would&#39;ve taken a few bottles home but we almost always have 3-4 bottles of various BBQ sauces on hand.   As far as sides, I&#39;ve only had their sweet tater fries, regular fries and their smoked tater salad.  The smoked tater salad is awesome, but I&#39;d like to have more than 3-4 ounces of it    

Service has always been great.  Very friendly, patient, etc.  We&#39;ve even met the manager on a couple occasions &amp; he&#39;s always warm and generously offers up some free samples of stuff!  Smart business plus always helps that your product is REALLY good!

As far as decor, you&#39;d easily pass it if you&#39;re driving by as the neon sign only says &#34;BBQ&#34; and it&#39;s in a strip mall.  Inside, it&#39;s your typical BBQ joint with the smoker right in front to greet you.  Not the cleanest place you&#39;ll ever see but gotta consider a man owns it, mostly male clientele,  it&#39;s BBQ and I&#39;ve always found that dive places seem to have the best food in terms of quality &amp; value."

All cooked to perfection. The burnt ends were the best either of us have ever tasted. There&#39;s about 5 different BBQ sauces you can add. The ribs and burnt ends were fine the way they were. The only thing I would suggest is the 2 different sauces labelled hot could be hotter, but that&#39;s a nit. The Mac n cheese bits were good and the cole slaw excellent. Can&#39;t wait to go back again. 

The restaurant is hard to see from the road and a bit on the small side. Approximately 8 tables inside which fill up fast. We arrived at 5 pm on a Saturday, all the tables were taken by 5:15pm and a line of people queued up to order already.

They have sweet and sweet and spicy bbq sauce,  but even the spicy is well balanced,  isn&#39;t overpowering,  and compliments the meat..even the juices from the pulled pork mixed so well..but I definitely say spend the extra money on burnt ends..it sounds weird but it&#39;s heaven.  The onion rings are good but the fried pickles are so much better.  The owner was incredibly nice..they even had wipes along with the napkins.

It was summer, on a Friday evening so there was quite a long line. Apparently there is not much air conditioning because it was quite hot inside. After waiting in line watching the process in the kitchen I realized why it was taking so long. The kitchen staff and process was very inefficient. We finally got to place our order, then had to wait a significant time again for it to be filled. You only get a certain amount of small containers for sauces. Finally got the food and luckily my husband snagged one of the few tables. Had to eat the food while a bunch of people in line filed past. We got their supposedly famous brisket and pulled pork and ribs. They were good but nothing exceptional. A few of the sauces were quite good. Fries were ok.

The food is delicious and the owner is a nice guy who knows how to treat his customers.  I&#39;m super picky about my BBQ sauce and Steamboat has the best sauce. It&#39;s sweet and a little twangy, but not smokey. Spicier sauces are available. We&#39;ve had the ribs, they are tender delicious, the brisket and pulled pork are the best I&#39;ve ever had. It&#39;s a 40-45 minute drive, and the corn bread alone is worth the drive. There is a BBQ place 5 minutes from where we live. We skip that and go for Steamboat.

I should take away 3 stars just for opening a &#34;fan flippin&#39; tactic&#34; restaurant in too small of a space. Next time we go we will bring an insulated cooler so if there is no place to sit our food will still be hot 45 mins later.

I consider myself a bit of a BBQ snob but this place did not disappoint! We came during lunchtime on a Friday and waited in line for a good 15 minutes before making it to the walk-up order window. My BF got the 3-meat combo which came with bread &amp; 2 sides and I got the burnt end sandwich (that&#39;s right, they have an entire sandwich full of burnt ends!!), which came with 1 side.

The food was incredible! The pulled pork was just OK but the hot links and burnt ends were out of this world! The onion rings were fried as usual then grilled to create perfect grill marks. The cold potato salad was super unique and tasty. The coleslaw was a little dry. What really put them over the top were their homemade BBQ sauces. Although it&#39;s not unusual for a Q joint to make their own sauces the flavor of Steamboat&#39;s was unreal! I liked the apple bourbon but what really got me was the Carolina mustard sauce. I usually dislike all things mustard but it wasn&#39;t bitter and had a good amount of spice.
The portions were good too. I mean, both of our meals totaled about $25 but to those who say this place is overpriced or has small portions don&#39;t know much about BBQ. 

The Negatives: This business has gotten too big for their britches. With the crowd they draw they desperately NEED a bigger restaurant. Between the people seated eating, those waiting in line to order, and those waiting to receive their food, this place is uncomfortably crowded. Speaking of the wait to get my food, it was a little long and some others who were in line after me received their food first."

Sausage links seem easy but ive had my share of dry, overcooked ones.  These are spicy and done right, just enough moisture and not greasy.

BYOB is a nice option to keep the price down when having a couple beers with your meal.  

I have to say, the brisket (what i went for) both times Ive been, is dry. The bark is flavorful but the rest is overdone in my opinion. They grill heat it before serving but not enough to rid most moisture so assume its just their process.  This is no Texas, or even Memphis brisket. My suggestion is to ask to see it before ordering so you have a chance to tell if its overdone.  I will from now on as i dont want to write it off based on two samples.

Cornbread is good too.  Mac/cheese bites are a good appetizer and my friends liked the fried pickles.  Friend got the burnt ends and they were decent..as point part of the brisket, again bark good and more moist than the flat slices. You have meat combo options of 2 or 3 meat.  I like that so you can try a bit of everything.  

Ive yet to have the pulled pork, tips, or ribs but will go with that next over the brisket.

Sauce options are good, mustard, sweet, spicy, 

The service is good, owner/mgr comes by the table to ask how we&#39;re doin.

The prices are in line with what i expect from a local bbq spot.  Ive been by this place many times and they are usually crowded, especially Saturday.  Parking can be difficult as its in a strip mall."

I was a devout pulled pork sandwich eater but on a whim I tried something different.  The different sauces they have are great but this piece of heaven between buns needs nothing.

Having lived in Texas for many years and call that my &#34;home&#34; state, I crave BBQ.  Steamboat fulfills my BBQ needs!!!!  The burnt ends had ridiculous flavor...crisp on some parts but still fall apart tender. Wow, my moth is watering doing this review right now.

To wrap it up...very good sized sandwich (I got the smaller one) with a side n fountain drink all for under $11.  Super full after this lunch!!!  I ordered fries as my side and they were flavorful and nicely crisp, hand cut gems.  

Get the burnt ends."

It can by quite busy so if its a nice day try to grab the bench outside. If you are going for something specific on the menu and its nearer the end of the working day I might call ahead and make sure, sometimes meats run out because they are so good. And finally parking can suck because of how busy they get, but its in a strip mall that opens up into a big parking lot so you&#39;ll find a space, you may just have to walk more.

I&#39;ve tried a lot of places in the city, but their brisket is the best.  Not to say they do not have things that are not as good as other places, but I love brisket and theirs is juicy with the right amount of char.  All of their sauces are good to fantastic.  My wife and I make a 20-30 minute drive out here when we have time from South Elgin.  Would highly recommend the apple bourbon BBQ sauce if you like sweet.  The mustard rivals the BBQ sauces on the menu, which is a first for me, as most places are overly sweet with theirs or too spicy.  I normally just get the pound of rib tips and fries, which is an amazing deal, but rib tips are not for everyone.  I won&#39;t go into detail on them, but ask before getting them.  The owner is really nice and makes time to check with customers when they are not so busy.

Seriously.

It&#39;s all about the food. This is some seriously good Barbeque, the best that I&#39;ve had in Chicago&#39;s suburbs.

I&#39;ve been here at least a half dozen times.. and the place is evolving. It used to be Butler&#39;s, then Smoke Ringz and now Steamboat.. Same owner for the last two places... but he kept the Butler sauce as one of his choices.

He can keep changing the name because it&#39;s not on the sign anyway. Not sure why he went with Steamboat (I liked Smoke Ringz) because there is absolutely nothing about this place that says Steamboat. Probably a more accurate name would have been something &#34;Shack&#34;... I say evolving because while shack might be appropriate for the inside now... a year ago it would have been a major  compliment to say &#34;Shack&#34;. 

He focused on the food, people came and he slowly has added some seating... and some plywood to close off part of the kitchen.. and he&#39;s got good people working there too!

Today I got sandwiches, a pulled pork sandwich and a brisket burnt ends sandwich, both with fries. Good fries, just not enough of them. Around 8$ for each of them (Brisket price was little higher) and they were excellent. I got excellent food for about what I would spend at a fast food place. I grabbed the Butler Sauce and The Firebox Hot Sauce today... they had another choice or two.. but I got what I wanted.

I usually get some ribs when I&#39;m here, they&#39;re excellent. They only offer St Louis style on the weekdays. I tend to prefer baby backs.. weekends only.

I will often get containers of Brisket or Pulled pork to take home and make a meal out of. It&#39;s a deal and we can eat for days.

A couple of things.. Only bring a first date here if they are extremely cool and like meat. It&#39;s rustic. You can BYOB, so you can go high end on some Zinfandel to go with that Brisket.

It&#39;s a small operation, they run out of stuff, so order ahead or prepare to be flexible."

My husband was born and raised Memphis, TN and I spent half of my life there, so our BBQ standards are a little different than many people in the Chicago area. Hence, we have a hard time finding what we would call GOOD BBQ......but I think we&#39;ve hit pay dirt at Steamboat! 

We stumbled in here on a Saturday evening and it immediately reminded us of a BBQ joint in the south. The delicious smell of smoky BBQ smacks you in the face as soon as you walk through the door.......yummy! There was a small crowd, but service was fast and efficient. After ordering, I went to find a table and as I walked past the open kitchen area, I saw a whole pig in the smoker. At that point, I knew.........Steamboat IS BRINGING IT!  

My husband and I both had the pulled pork dinner with fries. The dinners come with 2 sides, so my husband had Mac &amp; cheese and I had potato salad as a second side. The pulled pork was DREAMY. It was super tender and the flavor was amazing. The sides were all really good as well. The mac&amp;cheese worried us initially because it&#39;s fried triangles of mac &amp; cheese, but they were tasty. They also offer an array of sauces. We tried the Apple Bourbon sauce and we liked it so much, we didn&#39;t try anything else.

We met the owner and he is a super nice and friendly guy. He works in the kitchen and he walks around and asks everyone how their meal was. We talked to him about Memphis for awhile and he knew about all the best BBQ joints there......not just the touristy ones. He also gave our 2 boys free root beer floats!

If you want some real BBQ, you need to run, not walk, to Steamboat!"

It is the BEST BBQ joint in the Wheaton area as far as I&#39;m concerned. I&#39;ve eaten here quite a few times and never once had a bad experience.  

As odd as it might sound, I love how the place is set up. When you walk in there are a few tables to sit at, but behind the bar is this enormous smoker. It&#39;s just cool to be able to see where the magic happens, hahaha. 

Although I&#39;ve tried a few different things, my usual go-to is the pulled pork sandwich. They serve it dry but offer a ton of different sauces that you can add at your leisure. Try the meat first though before drowning it in sauce, you may just like it unsauced! I also tend to get the mac and cheese bites, because I mean.....come on......who can pass up fried mac and cheese triangles? If you&#39;re into fried pickles give those a go as well.

The service is always friendly and food comes out quick. I&#39;ve never had to wait longer than 5 minutes for my food and it&#39;s always fresh &amp; hot. For drinks they have fountain options or a cooler with various pops and such. ALSO, I should mention that they do allow you to bring in your own beer if you want to. Beer and BBQ, it&#39;s a match made in heaven.

Long story short, check out Steamboat. Instead of waiting for the summertime ribfests you can just stop by here for the best food any time of year!

I&#39;ll be in again soon!"

Of course they vary slightly time to time - when they are at their worst, they are just GREAT, and I add a little tiny bit of sauce.  When they are any better than that - which is most of the time - no sauce, and every bit is glorious.  

I tried the pulled pork sandwich the first time I was there - good, but lots of places have good pulled pork.  It didn&#39;t knock my socks off.  The second visit I tried the brisket - wow, that was great. 

The third time I had the burnt ends - and I have never had the willpower to try anything else, there is just no way I could pass up those burnt ends.  They are usually just INCREDIBLE.   Some of the specials sound great too, but I just can&#39;t miss my burnt ends.  

I organized a group coming from work every two weeks - it is about a 20 minute drive so not easy to do too often.  Well, mostly that ends up being every single week instead - nobody wants to wait another week for their fix.  

This is an authentic BBQ place, not a swanky joint.  Also come early or late to avoid the line and for easier parking, and in good weather it is great to sit on the picnic tables on the sidewalk.  

The only complaint I can come up with is that the coleslaw is pretty poor, which is a shame because I love some coleslaw with my BBQ.  That&#39;s minor considering just how good the BBQ is."

The boy ordered the Blueberry Pancakes which were served with blueberry compote and a side of bacon. The pancakes were good, but there wasn&#39;t much of the compote and there were very few berries in the cakes. If left him wanting more berries!

Our agent seemed to enjoy his healthy Smart Start meal, though I doubt there was much to mess up there! We were left to chat for a while undisturbed. It would have been nice to have been offered more coffee though, but I stuck to the water pitcher. Overall it is an average breakfast place. Nothing to write home about!"

The place is festooned with cocks and the occasional hen. Nicely done airy cool high ceiling comfortable. Wait staff clean friendly. Slacks shirts and outfits for the patrons business casual.

From their appearance the eggs easy were released on the grill  in a thin film, browned then chopped up to resemble scrambled. Interesting technique. The second batch slightly better same technique but not browned. The oven browned potatoes were white and chewy. Frozen and warmed in a microwave ?The coffee was of high quality and it was good. What happened to seasoned  salt?  They had some in back. Very little attention in preparation of the food, minimal effort, just coasting. Minor note , nice day tables still chained up at 7:00 AM, sat inside

Yikes ! Used to be decent. For the price paid the food should be much better."

Location Location Location. 

We all know downtown Wheaton is cute and all, but this place is steps off the Prairie Path.  
So you can have a relatively active morning doing your thing on the Path and then having a great brunch like me and 2 of my girlfriends did. Glen Ellyn to Wheaton, not a bad morning!

Like a lot of breakfast places, it can get packed on the weekends.  Luckily we arrived before the rush and got seated right away (9am Saturday). But by the time we left there was a big crowd waiting to be seated. 

The menu has a lot of good options. Egg dishes, pancakes, skillets, omelets, sweet or savory there&#39;s a lot to choose from. They serve Intelligentsia by the carafe and we didn&#39;t say no to having the server just leave a carafe for us on the table. 

I opted for the special of the day--breakfast tacos with egg and chorizo with a side of fruit.  It was good, but not enough chorizo for me to call it a &#34;chorizo breakfast taco&#34;. The salsa that&#39;s served with it was very tasty and the fruit was fresh--which is always great considering it&#39;s winter now. 

My girlfriends liked their dishes.  Michele S&#39;s pulled pork skillet looked really good and my other friend&#39;s veggie skillet looked well made too. 

Service was friendly, but was a little too laid back for my liking. We seemed to wait a while for everything...wait to order, long wait for food, wait for our check."

The name evokes images of Door County, WI where I have spent some wonderful getaways, and while this is just a restaurant, the service and food have an element of the simpleness of it&#39;s namesake.

Open for breakfast and lunch, this location, like the others, offers up some great egg entrees as well as sandwiches, soups and salads.  The decor is simple with wooden booths ( a little less comfortable than the tables as the seats are too close to the table for tall people), country type stuff all over the walls and friendly servers.

I usually order hot tea and this comes in an interesting server where the tea steeps and then you set the pot over your cup and the tea comes out the bottom of the pot (kind of like those new beer cups at stadiums that fill from the bottom)  Ask if you don&#39;t know how to use it as the first time I kept trying to pour it until my server popped by and showed me the trick.

Omelettes and salads are my favorite things here and I am never disappointed with the quality or quantity of food for a reasonable price.

This location has a private parking lot as well as you can use the lot across the street.  And there is rarely a wait which is also a plus!

Just a nice simple choice if you are looking for a good meal in Wheaton."

The first time I went here i ordered the Georgia cheesy grits. And they were so good that I haven&#39;t ordered anything else from there.  They are so amazing! Slow cooked grits, cheese, bacon, tomatoes, and onions. Yes! Get a side of avocado too. Trust me. 

This last time I went though they got a little stingy about the grits but they were still good. We went on new year&#39;s eve for a little brunch and even though it was packed we got seated pretty quickly. The restaurant has a very eclectic but homey feel. It&#39;s warm and welcoming. The service was good and the food came out fast. What else can you ask for?

Lastly you should also know I&#39;m slightly obsessed with all things eggnog and that  the best eggnog latte on the planet. Granted I haven&#39;t been all over the planet but I&#39;d still bet a penny that this is the best. 

A little pricey for the budget conscience but not unreasonable especially for the area. Check it out!"

My brother and sister in-law are frequent customers and said we had to try it while in town. So glad we did! I went for the Fried Green Tomato Benedict. It was Excellent! Eggs Benedict must be a specialty there because I saw their 3 options for it all over the restaurant tables. 
Tip for Sunday&#39;s: call ahead by 20 minutes if you have a group of 6 or more coming. Try to go before 10 am. Once it rolls to that time you&#39;re likely to wait an hour or more."

I figured there&#39;d be a longer interview process, but after going to Egg Harbor, I realize I don&#39;t need to try anywhere else. 

Their menu intrigued me especially since they had something they were calling Georgia Grits. If you&#39;re going to compare them to Southern cuisine, they better live up. I saw a few other menu items that sounded just as good but I ended up going with the grits. I like that they also have a variety of different iced coffee and espresso beverages. I ended up going with the dirty chai (chai and espresso.) it was pretty marvelous. Our server brought it out in a paper cup with a lid, which was a smart idea because it was too hot to drink during most of my meal. 

Our food was delivered mighty quick, but that&#39;s usually the case with breakfast food. My grits had bacon, jalapeños, tomatoes, onions and boat loads of cheese. It was also served with a biscuit and eggs my way (over easy.) I&#39;ve tried so many grits up here in the Northern parts and they&#39;re never quite right. I would say that the texture and consistency is as close as I&#39;ve tried outside of the south. If you&#39;ve only tried Cracker Barrels watery kind, you need to try real grits pronto.

Our server was incredibly attentive and welcoming. It was just the kind of service you hope of your new breakfast spot. I also really like the decor in here. It&#39;s pretty classic diner with modern touches. 

All around, I can&#39;t think of a single thing to complain about. I think I need to come back to Egg Harbor this weekend to try some more menu items."

It&#39;s fine, but it is probably my least favorite breakfast place in town. My friends from the gym like it, the staff is friendly and they handle groups well.

They serve Intelligentsia coffee, and give you your own little mini pot.

That&#39;s the good stuff.

The food deserves two stars

Having been less than impressed on past visits. (I&#39;ve had the combo breakfast, cinnamon roll french toast  ((it&#39;s fake!)) and an omelette in the past)  I decided to try a the Meat Skillet today. Dry, Dry, Dry... really.. this was another disappointment.  My wife Lisa tried their California styled omelette (avocado etc..) and thought it was probably the worst overall omelette that she&#39;s had in a very long while.

We asked for pancakes in lieu of the english muffin-, they didn&#39;t come out until we were almost done eating.. the pancakes (2) were mealy and small... the texture was off, flavor ok... 

Just another all around disappointment, especially with the far superior Eggclectic&#39; just one block down Hale St. Or, head to the Verdict on County Farm or the really excellent Red Apple on Main street

The fruit cup had fresh berries!! You can also tell the fruit cup is NOT pre mixed because none of the fruit is soaked in any other juices. 

Service is prompt without being pushy. Busy as it was, my server took time to answer my questions in a friendly manner. There is free coffee to sip while you wait to be seated and before you leave they offer you a to go cup for your unfinished coffee if you order it at the table.

The gluten free pancakes are a particular favorite of mine, their batter is from Sweet Ali&#39;s bakery, and it&#39;s delicious when made correctly, and served hot! The problem is that the cakes seem to be made in advance and set aside, then (sometimes) warmed up and served. Today, they were gummy, tough, cold and stiff (not the first time). Not appetizing. The bacon is also prepped ahead, and served room temp. When requesting it crisp, it&#39;s pretty spotty if you&#39;ll get it that way, depending on your server. One server brought it burned, twice. The second time, turning over to the less burned side. Some just ignore the request, and some bring it perfectly. Hit or miss.

The eggs Benedict were served underdone and jiggly with clear inner whites. We requested those redone, and when they finally returned, I was already finished eating and my plate cleared away for some time, they were hard as hard boiled eggs. The server asked how they were and when we mentioned that they were now overcooked, said, &#34;sorry about that, let me know if there&#39;s anything else I can do for you.&#34; Really?

To be fair, there are many nice servers at this Egg Harbor, which I guess is why we&#39;ve been regulars for a while now, but it seems there&#39;s usually something wrong with the meal; bacon or eggs under or over done, toast, eggs, pancakes brought cold. After a while, you just have to admit defeat. We feel bad, when we have to ask for the food to get remade, so often we end up just eating it anyways.

But now, we are leaving you Egg Harbor. It&#39;s time to find a restaurant that can time an egg, crisp the bacon, serve the food fresh and hot, and have all your employees, from chef, line cook, to server, care to bring the food out right.

Great family atmosphere and a great place for people watching. It&#39;s always busy on Saturdays but the wait is never too long and definitely worth the wait.

The place was packed on a Sunday morning. Hostess said wait would be around 5 minutes which I thought was impossible due to the large crowd. Waited and drank free coffee as we waited to be buzzed. 

After 8 minutes our beeper went off. Not exactly 5 minutes but still impressed cause of the crowd. 

Waiter was friendly and told us the special. Had the freshly squeezed OJ and lemonade. Damn that was fresh. Ordered the farmers garden Benedict&#39;s and the skillet bowl with banana bread French toast. It looked great and tasted amazing. Will definitely be back again."

I got the traditional with meat, so it ended up as two eggs, bacon (or other meat), and grits (which were a free sub for potatoes). 

My eggs over easy were barely runny, and more like over medium to over hard. I can make them better which is disappointing. Bacon was good. Grits were mediocre - I should&#39;ve stuck with potatoes.

Now, perhaps my meal is unfair to judge them on because it was so basic. I&#39;m sure things like pancakes and French toast that are more creative would be better to judge on. But my meal came out good, but just nothing special. 

Service was fantastic. The place was clean. Parking was easy on a Tuesday morning, but on weekends I bet it&#39;s a pain."

It can be crowded some times but if you are a local you must likely will run into someone you know. 

My favorite dish is the Pot roast skillet, it&#39;s not on the menu but they continue to make it because of its popularity. They even made a joke to our family that they only continue to make because our family orders them so often. 

My wife is gluten-free and she loves the options they have for her. The GF pancakes are arguably better than the regular pancakes.

First of all, let me start by saying that the parking lot is small and even the restaurant itself its a kind of small, but that&#39;s not a problem for me. When we got there I saw a lot of people and I mean a lot, and I thought oh boy this is going to be a long wait. So, I gave my name and I asked how long it would take to get us a table, and the guy said 10 minutes. I was surprised by that by how much people were waiting, and he was right no longer than 10 minutes my name was called and we were seated.

Today, I decided to go with one of the two specials that were on today and that was the Ishy&#39;s omelet. You can see a picture of it on my profile or on the business page. Anyways, we placed our order, my mom order the chilaquiles which she gave me to try and they tasted very good, and my dad ordered the san Antonio skillet. After another 10-15 minutes our order came. Now that&#39;s what I call service plus our waitress was cute even though i missed her name. Anyway, the omelet was perfectly cooked and the breakfast potatoes you have got to love these its like the egg harbor specialty, everyone loves their breakfast potatoes.

My final words... Outstanding and friendly service, quick and chill environment, and the food exellent or should I say EGGSELLENT!!"

First 75 degree weekend day of 2013, breakfast al fresco on the lovely streets of Wheaton with excellent service and fantastic food....could it get any better?

Actually yes, it totally can! It&#39;s called cinnamon roll French toast, find it on the menu, order it, and enjoy! I legitimately debating moving in to Egg Harbor as a permanent resident after a bite of this amazing invention. 

I made it a combo and had scrambled eggs with cheddar cheese along with their breakfast sausage. I have to be honest here, the eggs were properly cooked but I was not a fan of the fact that they just threw a handful of cheese on top of the eggs instead of cooking it in or folding it in to the eggs. I also wasn&#39;t a fan of the sausage...it reminded me of the sausage my dad used to cook when I was a kid that was defrosted from a box.

Their bacon was amazing. My sister benefitted from their last order of the thick cut bacon they had in house and she was kind enough to let me have a few bites. She also had the cinnamon roll French toast with that bacon and their home style potatoes. Also quite delicious. 

My hubby, the man that LOVES going out for breakfast because we rarely do, ordered lunch. He got the chicken wrap with fries. He ate that thing like it was his job. The fries were good and wrap looked delicious. I didn&#39;t taste it, although he offered, because I wanted to eat as much of my breakfast as possible. 

The service was excellent. The food was prepared quickly. The prices are totally reasonable. The location is perfectly placed in downtown Wheaton. I look forward to returning soon."

I am in Wheaton on a very regular basis, and only visited Egg Harbor for the first time on Labor Day, but I&#39;ll definitely be back. I was admittedly a bit skeptical, only because I&#39;m such a fan of a certain breakfast place in Carol Stream, but Egg Harbor did not disappoint at all. Great food, great atmosphere, and awesome service.

The food here is decent, along with the prices. That being said, I prefer Egglectic in DTW over Egg Harbor. It seems like the prices are the same, but you get more food at Egglectic, plus it&#39;s a bit better.

I&#39;ve had quite a few different dishes here, most recently the chicken pesto frittata (which was a special at the time, I believe). 

If you plan on going on Saturday or Sunday morning, be prepared to wait a bit. The church crowd defintely loves heading here on Sundays, so if you&#39;d like to get dirty looks, go during that time while not wearing your Sunday best.

The pancakes are okay here; they seem to skimp on the fruit side sometime. I&#39;ll be back eventually. Egg Harbor is solid, and I would recommend it to anyone in the Wheaton area for a good breakfast or lunch."

A different breakfast eatery has since sprung up in its former location but I always regretted not trying Egg Harbor when it was there. I recently became aware of a second location in Wheaton and decided to try it. 

When I came into Egg Harbor Cafe I was fairly quickly greeted and given a table. Unfortunately, the water pitcher that was on my table was leaking everywhere causing much of my table to be wet on arrival. When the waitress arrived she immediately noticed it, grabbed some paper towers and changed out the pitcher. Needless to say this wasn&#39;t exactly an ideal start to my meal. 

I decided to order the &#34;Matt&#39;s Meaty Skillet&#34;, it was ready in just a few minutes much to my surprise. Most breakfast places I visit generally offer a choice of pancakes or toast with a skillet. Egg Harbor differs from the norm in that they only offer choices of toast or an English muffin. I opted for the English muffin in this case.

The skillet I received was pretty decent, there were very thick chunks of soft potato that made up the bulk of it. The potato wasn&#39;t particularly crisp but wasn&#39;t too soft either. The meats tasted fine and the eggs were well prepared. I didn&#39;t notice the presence of any additional seasoning or oils besides the eggs, meats and potato. The English muffin was served hot and had a crisp texture. 

Overall my food at Egg Harbor was average. As far as service goes the waitress was extremely polite and fast. However the water leaking incident brought my service grade down a star. Overall Egg Harbor Cafe was a decent place to eat at and while I&#39;d visit again it wouldn&#39;t be high on my list of places to make return trips to."

We had breakfast here this morning and enjoyed every last bite.  A variety of things hit the table...blueberry pancakes, cinnamon roll french toast, yummy breakfast potatoes and crispy bacon.  We are creatures of habit and this is my favorite breakfast habit of all time.  Mike had a chocolate milk that he said was the best ever - well, after 13 years of life, he knows what he likes and he liked this.  I had a black current iced tea that really hit the spot.  

The service today was really good, too.  Michael (Love the name!) took really good care of us without being overbearing.  :-)

Sorry, but I have to knock them down one star for their air conditioning issues.  It&#39;s ALWAYS blowing on me regardless of where I sit and makes me rush through my meal.

I have to say, this place has GREAT food. It is a coin flip between here and Egglectic Cafe just down the road. A step below my Mecca of breakfast in Carol Stream (Red Apple), but as you can see, I am a breakfast enthusiast.

I ordered Gregg&#39;s Chili and Eggs! The chili was not only on top of the omelet, but also inside! This chili was black bean and chicken! I also got fruit instead of potatoes, and an english muffin! My brother ordered a chicken pesto frittata, and he looked like he enjoyed it too!

Thank you for a great Sunday Breakfast/Brunch/Lunch, Egg Harbor! Even though we had to wait 10 minutes (went at noon on Sunday), it was well worth it.

Most of the Wheaton church crowd was done, but we still got a few looks for not being in our Sunday best. I guess it comes with the territory!

I will say another thing the waitresses here and Egg lectic=DIMES! Unfortunately, I have to rate restaurants on food, atmosphere, AND service. Five stars for the former two, but the service here is just horrendous. One waitress I had was very pushy, but my goodness I love Gregg&#39;s Chili and Eggs. Their pancakes are not very good in my opinion. It was like I was eating slop (this was on another visit). They weren&#39;t held together very well.

In the rare situation when there is a problem with the food or service, local management goes above and beyond to fix the issue!

The only problem I have with this place is how loud and crowded it gets.  Now I know they can&#39;t tell people to leave so I can have the dining room to myself, but maybe throw a rug on the floor or acoustic tiles on the ceiling to deaden the reverberation of silverware on plates and babies screaming?

Instead of bringing me a glass of ice tea and filling it up after I was finished, our waitress brought me a craft of ice tea so I would have to wait to ask for another.  Also, at the end of the meal we were both asked if we&#39;d like our beverages &#34;to go&#34;.  Though I knew this was an option, I usually have to ask.  It was nice to be given the option instead.  

Overall, a very enjoyable dining experience and one that surely earned repeat business in the future.."

Went here Sunday with brother, sister, niece and my brood.  We walked in with a group of 7 and were quoted 30 minute wait for 7.  I mentioned we had 3 children with us and they were able to seat us in a booth for 6 within 10 minutes.   This was a plus.   Free Intelligentista coffee in the waiting area - another plus.

I ordered the banana bread french toast with eggs and bacon.   The french toast was wonderful, served with fresh banana.   Quite yummy.  The eggs were cooked perfectly and the bacon was cooked just right.   The interesting thing was the best dish was actually on the kids menu - the yogurt parfait they serve was tremendous.    My kids loved it and so did I.

Parking was easy in downtown Wheaton and worth the short wait.  Coffee is great.  Service was very good for a busy place.\

They do serve lunch as well but close for dinner.  For kids, this place had the biggest and most diverse kids menu I&#39;ve ever seen."

Growing up as an Egg Harbor kid, frequenting the Barrington location, there&#39;s something nostalgic about dining here. Perhaps that&#39;s why I love it so much. 

Service is extremely fast and friendly. I was quoted a wait of 10 minutes, and ended up waiting about two. Fab! I was starving! 

The bf ordered the Bavarian Benedict ((potato pancakes with poached eggs, bacon, and hollandaise instead of melted cheese)). The potato pancakes were to die for. YUM.  I went for Gregg&#39;s Chili &amp; Eggs ((egg-white omelet with black bean//chicken chili, cheddar//jack cheese, sour cream, tomato, and chives)). Both dishes - incredible. I inhaled that omelet like I hadn&#39;t eaten in weeks! The chili was packed with protein and fiber, and had just the right kick. Both dishes came with their infamous harbor potatoes and the option of a whole wheat or regular English muffin. Apparently they also make their own blackberry preserves now. It kicked the ass of those little jams they use to keep on the table. The preserves had the perfect amount of &#34;sweet&#34; and still had a few pieces of solid blackberry. I would have eaten it with a spoon if it were appropriate. 

Egg Harbor&#39;s biggest downfall?? They&#39;re only open until 2pm. Maybe that&#39;s a good thing, otherwise you might find me there morning, noon, and night."

The tea isn&#39;t I bags, bot properly loose in a pot withe a strainer.  2. They know how to poach an egg.  3.  They don&#39;t serve stupidly large portions like most breakfast restaurants.

This one is my pet peeves.  Piling the plate high with carbs - potatoes, breads, or other things is the mark of gluttony.  Too many American restaurants serve unhealthy sized portions.  Time to throttle back and start being realistic about what people can and should be eating."
egg-harbor-café-wheaton-2,Tom S.,QgSYm2uU5HZPKehyVpgQpw,"Geneva, IL",0,1,0,1,115,tpyKsn91lsgJCFLB8hOrVg,2.0,2013-12-24,"Because of all the other positive reviews of the Wheaton location of Egg Harbor Cafe, we (4 people) decided to go for our annual Christmas Eve brunch.  To say the least, we were not thrilled.

ATMOSPHERE:
We arrived a few minutes before our reservation time and they were quite busy, but we got our table immediately despite the waiting line which was a nice start.  Now, I realize it was a busy holiday and expected it to be pretty crowded, and it was, but it had to be about the noisiest place I&#39;ve ever eaten.  I chalk it up to the interior which has a high metal ceiling which probably amplifies every sound, rather than a softer, acoustic-type ceiling material which would absorb sound better.  Seriously, it was like a VERY noisy sports bar during a game broadcast, except that the one we go to sometimes, even when it&#39;s crowded, isn&#39;t nearly that loud.

SERVICE
Two of us who came in first were seated immediately.  The waiter said he&#39;d be right with us.  The other two in our party who were parking the car arrived a few minutes later.  Usually at a breakfast place, the wait staff promptly stop by to get coffee/drink orders, but we then waited for quite a while until our waiter made a 2nd appearance in the dining room to take our orders.

Then, &#34;the Decaf Incident&#34; happened.  My spouse ordered decaf and when the waiter came back with the coffees and started to pour hers, she asked him, just to be sure, if it was decaf.  (She&#39;s ordered decaf before only to get the real thing, so she checks.)  He very sarcastically said he &#34;thought she was joking&#34; and went out of his way to comment about it a few more times, like we besmirched his family name or something.  We must have breached sacred breakfast-place protocol because he made quite a big deal of it, like he was really insulted, and he wasn&#39;t joking.  We thought that rather odd.

Otherwise, he did a fine job with the orders, everything was correct and he was ever-present, but that incident put us off a bit, unfortunately.

FOOD
This is of course entirely personal preference, but I enjoy nothing more at a breakfast place than a great, homemade corned beef hash.  I make my own (spectacular!) with our annual St. Patrick&#39;s Day dinner leftovers at home, and so it&#39;s a treat for me on the occasions when we do go out for breakfast, which isn&#39;t often.  They don&#39;t have corned beef hash at any of the local Egg Harbor locations which means we&#39;d likely not repeat there, UNLESS we were really bowled over by other items, which we weren&#39;t, sadly.

So in lieu of my usual, I got the Matt&#39;s Meaty Skillet, described in the menu as &#34;loaded with bacon, ham and sausage.&#34;  It was nowhere close.  There was VERY little meat in my Meaty.  There was easily 3 times as much potato as the combined meats.  The &#34;Harbor potatoes&#34; are fine and all, and they were plentiful, but I didn&#39;t order (or expect) a skillet &#34;loaded with potatoes&#34; and then sprinkled lightly with meat.  And I had to look carefully to see the jack and cheddar cheese topping as there wasn&#39;t much of that, either.  Everyone else&#39;s egg-based dishes - an omelette, a Rösti, and a different skillet - were all very ordinary according to the others in our party.  Worse, our food was just warm, English muffins included, like perhaps it had sat for a bit before being picked up.  Nothing makes a so-so dish more unappealing than when it&#39;s simply not hot.  That&#39;s something very basic any restaurant should get right, IMO.  Their coffee was good, so there&#39;s that.

Oh, and as all the breakfast dishes are served with their English muffins, I expected them to be very special, like it&#39;s &#34;their thing.&#34;  But they&#39;re just average store-bought English muffins.

SUMMARY
So, as a clever reader would have already guessed, we weren&#39;t that happy with our trip to the Cafe.  The day wasn&#39;t ruined or anything because of it, but it wasn&#39;t the nice experience out together that we look forward to for our Christmas brunch.  Afterwards, I recalled that I&#39;d been to their Geneva location several years ago but we had never returned because I don&#39;t think it wasn&#39;t all that great, either.  We&#39;d probably not return to any of their locations but we&#39;ll try somewhere new next time we dine out for breakfast."

I enjoy the thermos of coffee they leave on the table. My mother in law is quite fond of the lobster scrambler. My son diggs the variety of options for the skillet. I enjoy the Bavarian Benedict and the Farmers Market Benedict. I come here most often; it&#39;s much better than most of the other breakfast places in this suburban area.

You hate it at first when your significant other forces it onto you.  Very slowly, you don&#39;t mind it so much until finally you buy TV Guide magazines to &#34;accidentally&#34; turn on the TV during &#34;Prayers for Bobby.&#34;

At first, I wasn&#39;t very adventurous with my choices.  Luckily, they have a pretty solid array of regular breakfast favorites - the Bacon &amp; Onion Skillet is a nice, hearty meal for your insecure, male companion.

Eventually, I branched out and was surprised with their selection.  The Key West Crepes and Banana Bread French Toast Combo jump out as immediate favorites.  And if you exhaust their menu, they do a great job of adding new items each season.

The restaurant gets very crowded during peak hours (11:00AM-1:00PM) as the Wheatonites leave their various churches in search of overpriced food so if you&#39;re a morning person, come early.  Otherwise, wait until at least 12:30PM-1:00PM before showing up.

All in all, it&#39;s a great breakfast place and the service is far superior - and less discerning - than Egglectic&#39;s on the other side of Wheaton&#39;s &#34;rough&#34; tracks."

Eggs are super hard to keep fresh and tasty when they have to be made ahead of time in bulk and these guys do a great job. Great fruit selection, cinnamon rolls are good enough, and pancakes are yummy.

My Benedict Florentine were delicious, poached eggs cooked perfectly, silky egg yolk oozing out after cutting into it, hollandaise light (hmm... Is it possible?) and lemony, spinach freshly cooked and not killed - beautifully green with a right texture. Hash browns, side of my choice, could be a little crispier but that&#39;s my personal preference. I also ordered (what? Breakfast supposed to be the biggest meal of the day!) turkey sausage links - tasty, little dry, and short stack of pancakes, nice and fluffy.

Lots of nicely cooked veggies: mushrooms, onions, broccoli with asiago cheese and two eggs on top. I got the pancake because they are reliably good. Decent coffee, nothing special, diner-type. Here&#39;s a big plus in my book: the portions are NOT huge. I am not a big eater and I hate to see a plate come my way that counts as three meals.

Our waitress was very friendly and helpful. They seem to have a lot of regular customers whom she greeted by their name. We ordered banana nut French toast and the Denver skillet. It came out fast and looked fresh. I would have liked two thick pieces of toast instead of three thin slices, but no complaints on the taste. The Denver skillet had a lot of spinach. Usually the spinach is non existent at other places.  All the condiments were readily available on the table and we were periodically checked up on. The best is the price. Overall, nothing on the menu was over $10. Will definitely come back here for lunch."

I checked Yelp to see if I had overlooked anything good and noticed this place. My mom agreed to check it out with me, so off we went.

If I had realized this place was in the location it&#39;s in, I might have declined prior to going... It&#39;s an awkward, busy corner restaurant that has been ten zillion different things in my lifetime alone. The parking lot is atrocious and entering/exiting is complicated. Still, we were already here and being that it was Saturday at 10:30AM, it wasn&#39;t brutally packed.

We walked in and waited just a few minutes for a table for two and were seated at a booth near a window. It was insanely bright in there and my section of the booth was freestanding, which was scary. Twice during our meal I accidentally pushed the booth itself backward and had to straighten it. You can&#39;t take me anywhere.

The menu is standard diner breakfast fare, boasting fewer options than some of our other favorite local spots but still plenty to choose from. My mom got a country gravy Benedict something or other and I got the corned beef hash skillet. the food was totally satisfactory. The coffee was fine, the service was fine. Everything was fine. Not outstanding, but pleasant.

I notice a lot of the reviews here remark on how amazing the owners are and indeed, it was refreshing to see who I think we&#39;re the owners walking around on the floor, asking how meals were, and even gathering servers to sing happy birthday to a patron while we were there. I don&#39;t know the owners but they seem like lovely people, and they&#39;ve certainly established quite a following for their restaurant. As for me, I&#39;d certainly return to the Golden Basket, but I likely won&#39;t add it to our regular rotation for breakfast."

So today I came with my family and I wanted to try something new so I got the egg Benedict. Only after taking a bite I didn&#39;t like the sauce because it was too sour so I had the waitress take it back. When I got the bill, I was charged for the meal that I didn&#39;t eat. When i brought this up to the lady at the front desk, she didn&#39;t seem to care that I wasn&#39;t satisfied with my food. Just because I didn&#39;t like it, doesn&#39;t mean I have to pay for it. The lady only then took off only 10% off the egg Benedict. So if you plan on eating here. Make sure you order something you&#39;ll know you&#39;ll like because you&#39;ll end up paying for it even if you don&#39;t like it. I left disappointed."

After my second visit, it&#39;s a keeper. The breakfast fare is pretty much the same items you&#39;ll find on the menus of other early morning restaurants. Omelettes, pancakes, skittles, etc. 

What separates Golden Basket from the rest, is the high level of friendly service. There is hardly a wait for that first cup of coffee. Throughout the rest of your meal, you never do that head turny thingy, where you scan the room for your server. You know, you need ketchup, another cup of coffee, or you are ready for your plates to be cleared. 

It&#39;s apparent to me that service is a team effort. Things happen, the place is always busy, yet no one seems stressed or rushed. They smile, look happy keep your cup full. What could be better? The speed which our food arrives to our table after placing our orders has been uncanny. I swear that the cooks listen in at the table while we placed our breakfast orders. 

A couple of other small touches. Coffee is served in the obligatory, stoneware mug. Also, with advertising! They also place your mug on an appropriated sized saucer. I dare you to find another &#34;Greek Diner&#34; that uses saucers. It&#39;s a nice place to set your stirring spoon instead of right on the table. The water glasses are also real glass. Pretty hefty also. Usually, your water is served in plastic. 

The food is terrific. One small (small) annoyance is the sound level. It is noisy. It&#39;s not the sort of place where you could negotiate a business deal. That is, unless you think the other guy is with the Feds and is wearing a wire. Then, you&#39;re good."

So we&#39;ll just descend, unannounced, on the closest well reviewed breakfast place I find in 15 seconds of searching on Yelp. And we have a winner.

Like a plague of locusts, basically every college buddy I have plus wives arrived at The Golden Basket (no, not the Golden Nugget). We warned them it was a huge party, but within maybe 10 minutes, they had three tables prepped to accommodate 13 of us. And then, right as we were being seated, when the bride and groom call to ask what we&#39;re doing for breakfast (who&#39;d have thought they&#39;d be available), they managed to make it work for 15? Crazy. I&#39;ve been in much larger restaurants with way less logistical ability.

They have your standard array of omelettes, skillets, pancakes, and, according to the menu, &#34;Belgium Waffles&#34; which I assume contain actual bits of the sovereign nation. I went with a Mexican skillet, with hash browns, japanenos (plenty of them), pepper jack cheese, pretty good non-greasy chorizo, and two scrambled eggs. Hit the spot. I even ate the eggs, which is rare for me. It also came with toast, which I didn&#39;t need, but ate anyway.

Our waitress was good - very quick to refill coffees and waters - I let a big tip, I hope others did too. Who knows when I&#39;ll be back in the area at breakfast time, but for a good breakfast and outstanding service, I would definitely come back."

The place I was going in Hinsdale apparently closed down and didn&#39;t notify me. That&#39;s just rude. 

So after a quick search of Yelp, I found the Golden Basket and decided to give it a try. The outside of the building is nothing spectacular, and if I were doing the book-by-its cover thing, I probably would never have stopped.

But inside it&#39;s pretty cute. It looks to be recently remodeled and has plenty of intimate tables and booths. I sat at the counter because everything else was full (on a Friday morning!) so they obviously do good business.

The menu is full of typical breakfast/brunch fare; diner food. But I appreciate that there&#39;s a full selection of healthy items too. That&#39;s awesome.

Of course, being my birthday, calories and fat don&#39;t count. So I had the pork tenderloin eggs benedict. Yeah. It was delicious. The pork was seasoned nicely. They seem to specialize in pork dishes, as there&#39;s one or two in every category. I made a mistake in choosing the hash browns instead of the house potatoes. They had that frozen taste to them, and when they were cooked they didn&#39;t use enough oil and too much salt, so they had that dry, hot flavor they get when I make them at home. Get the home fries when you go. I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll be better. 

Still the potato incident wasn&#39;t enough to negatively impact my rating. They get a solid four stars. I would&#39;ve given five if not for the potatoes and that the waitress (who was incredibly bend-over-backwards friendly and welcoming) didn&#39;t get back to me to refill my drink until I finished eating. That was because they were so busy. Had I flagged her over, I&#39;m sure she would&#39;ve been happy to do so.

Very nice place. I will definitely come back."

My daughter and I were looking for a &#34;proper breakfast&#34; around 10 in the morning last Saturday and we ended up at Golden Basket because the Willowbrook Juicy-O had no parking available. Yelp looked good, so we wanted to give it a try.

The place was packed and the hostess (owner?) suggested the counter seating. I&#39;m going to guess that the counter does not have an assigned waitress because one person took our order for beverages, then another waitress asked us what we wanted to drink and then took our order.

The food was just ok. I had a meat lover&#39;s skillet, which was quite meaty, although I noted that some of the sausage link slices had been burned on the grill. My daughter had Fruity Nutty French Toast and was unimpressed. I&#39;d call it a basic breakfast, but don&#39;t expect freshly squeezed OJ, because they pour it out of the Prairie Farms gallon jug. 

The one particularly bothersome thing, however, was that one of the waitresses had brought her son to work. The poor kid (probably 8 or so) was bored stiff and had the run of the place. He was underfoot behind the counter and playing with his toy cars on the counter and across the prep area. I also noticed him opening some of the containers where garnishes were kept.  I&#39;ll give the staff credit for wiping down the counters pretty frequently, but a sticky-fingered kid has no business back there.

I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to eat here, but if you&#39;re looking for basic breakfast, it will do."

I first had the dish in Virginia, and don&#39;t think that us Yankees really do it justice for the most part. The Golden Basket&#39;s B&amp;G ($5.25 for a full order) is good, but not spectacular. The gravy has more than a strong note of black pepper to go along with the sausage bits accompanying the gravy. I liked it, but it wasn&#39;t in the top quartile of what I&#39;ve tasted. The service, however, was fantastic. My coffee cup never got close to the halfway mark before it was topped. I&#39;ve heard good things about their omelettes and scrambles, and may give them a try on my next go-round. And there certainly will be a next one. I generally drive 20  or 25 minutes towards the city to get a tasty breakfast. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll do that next time. The prices are more than fair for the quality of food. Check it out."

For example I ordered the challah bread french toast and the challah wasn&#39;t challah it was some commercial version of challah bread.

We were not greeted at the door. We stood awkwardly in the doorway and were ignored. When we finally did get a table, it was the worst one, right in front of all the other awkwardly waiting people who had nowhere to go. So we were stared at the whole time we ate. It was super loud, too.

We have a party of 3-4 people.  The food has been pretty good, and would keep me coming back and deserves a higher rating than one star.  The problem is the owner&#39;s &#39;customer service.&#39;
Last few times, we all ordered Coke products and it&#39;s tastes bad.  We have complained a couple times, and the waitresses try to fix it but in the end we &#34;shut up and settle.&#34;  Today we went in with a party of 4, all ordered Cokes with breakfast, and it tasted again unpalatable.  Syrupy, no CO2, I have no idea? The woman manager comes over angry that we are complaining again, and tells us all we are the only ones that complain!  She said &#34;I know what Coke tastes like and it&#39;s fine, okay?&#34; in a very condescending tone.  We disagree but  go on with breakfast.  
She and a tall man are watching our table like a hawk for the rest of the breakfast, literally staring so hard we can feel it.
At he end, my mom pays the bill, and when the cashier asks how everything was, my mom complained to the cashier.  The woman manager/owner comes rushing over to let us know she&#39;s know we must be crazy because we&#39;re the only ones complaining...and she told us loudly NOT TO COME BACK TO THE RESTAURANT.

I&#39;m so sick of going to the same place. A bunch of junk hung all over the walls (usually chickens and egg puns), virtually the same menu, so-so coffee, and so-so service. Too may tables crowded in to serve that one or two more parties making it uncomfortable for everyone involved. 

Well great news - this is all the great parts of the diner without all the crap. 

Still a comfortable diner feel, original design with minimal chickens, well spaced tables, thoughtfully put together menu (yes still all your favorites, but well done with some different things on the menu and specials all the time), and, to top it off, sincerely friendly service.

I stopped by around 12:30pm for lunch.  They were busy but not overly so.
They had ample wait staff who were very attentive and seemed to know many of the other patrons through repeated visits. 
I ordered the French Toast Platter with eggs and fruit in lieu of bacon and sausage.  
It arrived very quickly and well presented on individual plates.  I do dislike when other restaurants try to cram all the food on one plate.  
I also placed a to-go order of the Turkey and Bacon Club sandwich with fries for a friend.  I really liked that they offered a cup of house made soup with the sandwich. Very few places offer a soup and I miss when they did.  It made the meal.
The soup was Tomato Bisque, a savory creamy tomato soup with rice.  Came with a roll and saltine crackers.  
My friend thoroughly enjoyed his meal.  
We both discussed it and both plan to go back to try more of the menu.

The restaurant was very clean and bright.  Plates and silverware were clean (big pet peeve to get dirty utensils).  Staff was smiling and attentive.
Food was very good and a good value (even without the Entertainment coupon).  Entire menu was reasonably priced.
I plan to go back.  Only downside, is that they are only open till 2pm."

You can not find better people than the owner&#39;s Jim and Dina.  They treat us like family and we think of them in the same way.  My parents birthday was last week and Dina even got them a huge cake and had the restaurant sing happy birthday to them.  
The food is amazing.  They have typical breakfast items like pancakes and eggs, but the skillets are something you come back for over and over again.  They always have daily specials that may or may not be typical menu items, so I suggest starting on the special board above the fire place.  By now I think I&#39;ve tried almost everything on the menu at one point in time and I haven&#39;t found one thing that I thought was bad.  I remember when I first tried this restaurant on a lunch break whim and I&#39;m now a weekly visitor.  Give it a try, you will not be disappointed."

This is the best way to describe it as the staff and owners seem to know everyone, the customers know everyone and if your new, they make you feel welcome and try to make you feel like you&#39;re one of the gang.  It&#39;s a bit of a throw back to the small town diner in this way.

I alway judge my diners on their ability to make a delicious, fluffy and large omelet. Maybe it&#39;s the old football player in me but I simply hate a wimpy skinny, flat omelet!  I had the spinach and feta cheese omelette (some places call it a Greek omelette) with the hash browns and toast.  Yes, it was nice and fluffy, large and delicious!  They have two choices of hash browns - home style potatoes or regular style.  The coffee was hot and kept coming at a fast pace. 

They decor and atmosphere is nice, kind of reminds me of grandmas place in a small town.  There is plenty of seating with many booths and interior tables.  When I was there, most of the place was full.  Seemed like people were meeting there instead of bringing family.  

Overall, it is now one of my favorites!  It seems as though it&#39;s many people&#39;s favorite too.  The parking lot looks like it&#39;s always full which have to make Jim and Dina happy.  They&#39;re the owners as you can see from the sign on the street, they put their name on it proudly.  It&#39;s nice to be known by name."

We have driven by here for years and always noticed a crowd but had never stopped in. As we walked in they were singing happy birthday to one of the guests; the whole restaurant was singing.  

They quickly rearranged some tables to seat us together. The hash browns that I ordered were perfectly cooked. I also had very good biscuits and gravy (the half order was plenty). The price was very reasonable. Others in our party ordered omelets, pancakes, fruit salads, and breakfast steaks. Every one like their meals.

Definitely give it a try. Note they are not open for dinner and close at 2pm."

We get seated quickly (the place roughly half full), and then the waitress disappears.  Fast forward 5 minutes, she asks for our drink order.  Fast forward another 15 minutes, she finally gets around to asking for our food order.  Mind you, we&#39;ve already had our menus closed and stacked up to make it clear that we&#39;re in a hurry.

Cream of potato soup is watery.  The &#34;rolls&#34; that you get with your meal are those stale, old breadsticks that you see at other geriatric restaurants.  Hard as a rock.

I ordered the &#34;big dipper&#34;.  What I got was a hard roll with maybe 2oz of roast beef.  The &#34;au jus&#34; tastes kind of like onion soup.

And by no surprise, after they cleaned our plates it took another 10 minutes to get our check.  We tried to make eye contact with the manager, but he seemed to ignore us every time he walked by.  And now I&#39;m back at the office, 90 minutes after we decided to try this place and get some quick sandwiches."

Omelets and skillets are sensational. The coconut french toast and the heavenly pancakes are the reason I go here.

That means we have to go out for breakfast.  The wife suggests the place on Cass that&#39;s on the corner.  Anyway, ...

We&#39;ve driven by this place numerous times and finally decided to give its breakfasts a try.  The restaurant doesn&#39;t look like much from the outside.  Parking is chaotic.  People park anywhere, any which way, when there are mounds of packed snow.  Fortunately, we found a spot to park.  The interior reminds me of small-town restaurants from the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s.  I am glad to see that the place is packed.  An empty breakfast place on a Sunday morning is something you should never see. 

Service is friendly, both quick and slow.  In other words, a bit sporadic in how fast/slow things are done.  Our waitress liked to chitchat with other waitresses and wasn&#39;t the most efficient, but she was friendly and more often than not, busy, running around taking care of her tables.  We had no real complaints other than it took a while to find and bring some tomato juice to the table.  The owners can be seen in the kitchen and on the floor, filling coffee cups, making sure everything is running smoothly.

The food is pretty good,  We had a full-stack serving of the regular French toast and an order of the cinnamon-swirl French toast with links.  Hot maple syrup is served with it.  This meal was good.  The prices are also great, lower than many breakfasts in the area.

We will come back again for breakfast and maybe come here to try out their lunches."

Complimentary cheddar biscuits - very good, wished they were served warmer though.
Roasted poblano soup - excellent! Spicy kick from jalapenos was intense.
Lobster mac n cheese - excellent! OMG so cheesy but not oily/heavy on the palate.
Shrimp po boy sandwich with fries - good portion of shrimp, tasty apple slaw
Jambalaya - this was probably the least liked dish of the night. It was OK but nothing to reorder again.

The building is very historic and impressive, the staff was great, and the food was tremendous. We stopped in for lunch, but their dinner and brunch menu also looked awesome. In addition to the extensive menu they have a cool bar a lots of good beers on tap and craft cocktails.  

We started out with the sunday special andouille chili.  It was awesome! At first glance, something about it looked different (chucks of butternut, thinner liquid component), but after the first bite I was loving it, and fully convinced it was a true chili through and through

We were both in the mood for sandwiches and she went with the BLT with avocado and I had the turkey swiss with coarse mustard and berry compote.  My turkey sandwich was phenomenal and definitely reminiscent of thanksgiving. I was happy I added lettuce and tomato to give it a bit of freshness and crunch, but overall A+. Her BLT was super solid and the best part was certainly the pepper aioli. It had the perfect amount of &#39;bite&#39;. Fries were a bit less fresh/hot/crispy then I woulda liked, but eh.

We visited for her birthday dinner, we called in a reservation. Though it was crazy Saturday night busy we were seated immediately. Our server was very friendly, went over the menu and specials and brought us the small plate apps and drinks we ordered very quickly. Here&#39;s where the controversy starts...

We ordered our main dishes right about the time the apps showed up. We were done with the apps and nearly (forgive me if times are not exact) 45 min later I noticed the hostess kept looking at us in a concerned manner and talking to another person just out of sight. About that same time my wife said &#34;I think they missed our order&#34;, and seconds later the server came through and said your order will be right out. We got our main courses nearly an hour after ordering. 

I call it a controversy because we were enjoying our drinks, the atmosphere and each other to the point that we didn&#39;t notice the food delay (time is relative). The fried catfish with dirty rice I ordered was much better than expected, straight out of New Orleans.

While I want to pull a star for the late order, so many other things made up for it, and we shall return."

But the more I think about it, it&#39;s definitely not a &#34;round this up&#34; situation. Here goes. 

Love the thought of a nice (but not overly formal) restaurant in a restored mansion. But. Inside was nice, but decor was minimal. Not in an intentional, minimalist kind of way. Just kind of... unfinished. Bare walls in the room we were in. It was strange. Like the intimacy of the structure itself, but once inside... I can&#39;t describe it. Maybe because of the one room we were in? Again. So bare. 

Gumbo was great. LOVED the gumbo. That gets a star in and of itself. Comes with a scoop of rice in the middle and minimal rice elsewhere, so if you tend to shy away from carbs (forget that gumbo is made with roux for a second), then this felt like a decent option. Baked brie appetizer was forgotten (as in, it never came - server admitted he blew that one and apologized approximately five times.) They brought a basket of house biscuits with the soups. Didn&#39;t try one, but others enjoyed them. 

Here&#39;s the thing that got me: Was totally looking forward to the Berkshire Pork Chop because of the pistachio cream sauce. But... no pistachio cream sauce. It was some of kind of buttery sauce, almost a beurre blanc - tasty, but not at all what was listed on the menu/what I ordered/what I&#39;d been looking forward to. Server had been around quite a bit before that; after five mins I gave up waiting to ask about it and started eating. 

The food came pretty fast (especially since the server totally forgot to put the order for the baked brie appetizer in) and the whole experience just kind of felt rushed. We were in and out in about 45 mins. I like to enjoy my food and take my time. Not an option this trip.

Also - it is loud. Old house acoustics? Lack of anything on the walls to help muffle sound? I don&#39;t know. But hard for groups to converse with one another and - while I bet it looks awesome and romantic for couples from the outside - I doubt you&#39;d be able to hear each other all that well. That said, likely depends on the room, so don&#39;t take just my word for it. Lots of smart reviews and opinions here!

Anyway. We were pretty much over it after how the meal went, so we didn&#39;t stay for coffee or dessert. Probably wouldn&#39;t go back, which is a bummer - I was convinced I would love this place. Food we got was tasty but... not exactly what we ordered. Not sure I&#39;d pay to go back and find out.

PS - there are a ton of &#34;not recommended&#34; reviews. Read them. Some are very thoughtful and I got carried away when I first saw this place and didn&#39;t read those first (as I&#39;ve learned to do and am now usually pretty good about!)"

The red pepper soup was flavored with a touch of spice that was true to Cajun style and just enough to tease the palate. The duck was moist and covered with a delicious glaze. I don&#39;t normally care for grits, But these were firmer than in most places and I found them to be delicious this way! Loved the beignets as well! True to New Orleans style."

We&#39;ve been here a few other times since my initial review and unfortunately have yet to have the same experience as the first time. (Maybe because all subsequent visits have been during normal dinner hours?)

The second time both food &amp; service was mediocre, but we thought maybe they were just having a bad night. We tried again, taking my MIL here for her birthday. We sat inside &amp; had 6p dinner reservations on a Saturday. What a disappointment. 

Service was a combination of rushed and yet nonexistent. (Could never find the server when we needed her) Our courses came out on top of each other. Several things were the wrong temperature, with little effort to correct the problems. We were so disappointed since the restaurant itself is absolutely gorgeous. We really wanted to like this place. It should have 2.5 stars, but keeping it at 3 because the first time really was a good experience. However the next three were consistently disappointing... Not sure we&#39;ll be back any time soon. 

----------------------

Stopped in on a warm summer Friday afternoon &amp; sat on the porch. The place is beautiful, inside &amp; out. 

We mentioned it was our first time &amp; the staff was very helpful/welcoming. We tried the crab cakes &amp; grits, which were just okay. Seemed like there was more filler than crab &amp; the grits weren&#39;t as creamy as I expected. However the flavor was good &amp; the other things we tried were amazing. 

The Applewood Smoked BLT was so layered in flavor, we were surprised it was a simple BLT. And the strawberry shortcake was to die for. The cake was light &amp; spongy, with the flavor of a butter poundcake but airy with homemade whipped cream &amp; an essence of mint. Was so refreshing on a hot day. Can&#39;t wait to try some of the other items on the menu."

The nicest thing about this place is the setting. That&#39;s not to say the food is bad. Far from it. The food is very good. Is this the best food you&#39;ve ever had? Probably not, but it is very good and worth your time and money.

The house is chopped up into multiple dining areas because it is a house. We liked that. It added to the intimacy of the whole joint. 

The attention to detail throughout the house is outstanding. Fixtures, woodwork, etc. are really great.

I really loved this place. You should go."

Celebrated my birthday with some girlfriends. Used to be a home or mansion so table are spread out in separate rooms which is perfect for intimate dinners. Check out the upstairs bathroom. So cute. Decor so cozy and the food matches the atmosphere, classy and comforting. You have to try the Brussel sprouts!  I can eat them as my entree alone. I&#39;m going back just for the sprouts. The beet salad with goat cheese and shrimp and grits were really good too. After dinner, walk over to All Chocolate for dessert."

Perhaps that should be indicative of other problems..

We went to the Patten House for the first time on Sunday, the 22nd of May, at the recommendation of our good friends and fellow guests who have had cocktails but no meals at the establishment before. We were excited!

We made reservations for 7 pm. We were finally sat around 7:30 by an exasperated-looking hostess, but no matter, we had great drinks from the bar and the place seemed busy- I&#39;m patient. We were sat outside on the patio which was lovely. We ordered appetizers after much deliberation; everything on the menu looked great! Appetizers arrived and they delivered on our expectations of being good. However...at this point..our dinner orders still hadn&#39;t been taken and it was nearing 8 pm, which I felt was odd for appetizers to be delivered to a table before ever even being asked if we were ready to order entrees. Again... no matter. We ordered. 

Roughly an hour later, our food still hadn&#39;t arrived. It was clear the establishment had several graduation parties and dinners and we were told they were &#34;extremely busy.&#34; This was fine, however, it would seem to me that in those cases, hostesses/management is responsible for the capacity of the restaurant as well as the capability of the kitchen- don&#39;t seat more unreserved guests without ensuring the quality and condition of the food is at its peak. To do otherwise is irresponsible- better to turn away guests and ensure the experience of those who were seated than irritate a houseful of unsatisfied customers who won&#39;t return anyway. Our server was apologetic but we were never offered drinks, desserts, etc to mitigate the circumstances. 

It was during this time that a fellow patron seated near us made it clear they had some sort of family or friend connection to several staff members. Our (obviously busy) server was regularly called away from other duties to attend to this table and when their food was not prepared to their liking, evidently it was appropriate as a guest to personally deliver it back to the kitchen? Not much of this would have garnered my attention, however the obvious freebies and apparent access to private enclosed servers stations to grab a menu (help yourself?) was bothersome. 

Finally- our food arrived- over 2 hours after our initial reservation. My chicken stuffed with andouille and pecans was okay- however half of my fingerling potatoes were under-cooked to the point of being crunchy- an obvious shortcut made by a hurried kitchen. My husband&#39;s dirty rice was also under-cooked. The rest of our food was underwhelming- it&#39;s hard to rate food that you can&#39;t see (because it&#39;s dark) and waited nearly 2 hours for. At no point after food was delivered did our server check in with us, except to offer dessert, which at that point was a bit like offering water to someone who is drowning. 

We brought our concerns to the attention of the bar manager. Our food was mediocre, the wait was atrocious, and the insulting salt in the wound was watching other patrons receive specialized treatment and access- something I recognize the management has no control over. However, one gesture that they DID in fact control was the final taste left in our mouths- which was to remove $40 from our $200 check. I&#39;m so sorry, Patten House. You were apparently outrageously busy and likely made decent money that day. I walked away feeling extreme buyer&#39;s remorse with mortified friends that were sorry to have ever made the suggestion. I hope the money you saved by not making any of this right was worth it- because you&#39;ll likely never see more of ours again. Apparently it was a winning night for the house, but not the guests."

The food is always good, and normally the ambiance is great. However, last time I was here, we had a problem with the hostesses. 

I was meeting my sister for a late lunch (1:15), on a weekday. We wanted to sit on the patio. I had my 4 month old, so it&#39;s much easier to sit at a normal table, rather than a high top. When I walked in, the hostess was on the phone. She neither greeted me, nor even acknowledged that I was there for quite some time. After she got off the phone, I told her I was meeting someone. She stared blankly at me and just said &#34;ok.&#34;  I asked her to sit outside, and requested a regular table. She told me none were available. She led me outside (without holding the door for my stroller), and sat me at a high top. 

About 2 minutes later I realized that a regular table was open literally right next to me. I moved over. Not a minute later, another hostess came out, and told me that they keep that table open for parties of 5 or more, and as I only had 2 in my party, they would like me to move back. I explained that I had a baby, and it was logistically easier to be at the same height, as I would be constantly going up and down if I was up high. I told the hostess that if a large party came in, we&#39;d switch back, but for now, we&#39;d like to stay. 

I thought everything has been settled. However, a few minutes later, the hostess came out again. She told us we had &#34;options.&#34; We could either sit at their bistro table (a tiny set of patio furniture relegated to the back of the patio), or we could sit at the original high top. She said that she didn&#39;t want us &#34;to make a scene.&#34; We basically threatened to go somewhere else before she let us stay in our table. 

The ridiculous part of this whole thing is that it was a weekday lunchtime when half the patio was open! Not 10 minutes after this whole scene took place, another large table opened up! I didn&#39;t want to be difficult, but as I had a baby, that table just made life way easier. I don&#39;t understand why all this trouble had to be made for a table! In this case common sense and customer service were utterly lacking. As my sister told the hostess at the time, the experience ruined Patten House for us."

Have been to The Patton House many times over the years and it&#39;s had been top notch, but on the past three visit and especially this last, it has fallen short. 

Even with a reservation we have been forced to wait 35-55 minutes past the confirmed time to get a table with-out an apology from the hostess or management. Glad a local spot is that busy but a wait that long needs to be addressed 

Ordered the Oysters Rockefeller, 1/2 dozen for the order. After my wife and I had 1, both our 2nd oysters smelled like horse manure! When address to the waitstaff, we were told &#39;I&#39;ll tell the chef&#39;, without any apologize and the plate was left on our table. Finally was able to flag down a busboy and he took the pungent plate away.

Tried to chose a wine and all 5 of my choices for a red were either out (2 of them) or they didn&#39;t carry any longer (3 of them). Understand if you run out, but to have 3 different bottles at $75 plus be listed on the wine list and no longer carry is just classless. 

We tired to power though, as it has been a great establishment, and ordered some additional small plates. The crab/grits and shrimp/grits arrived with the seafood portion ice cold and the grits a ball of paste. On top of that, the brussels with honey/heat came out looking like a dogs lunch. 

It&#39;s sad to write this review, but feel The Patton House has fallen from grace. It won&#39;t be getting my $ any longer and I&#39;ll make it a point to tell my friends to stay away as well."

What a nice addition to the Down Town Geneva dining scene.  I can&#39;t believe I&#39;ve missed this gem.  I have my trusty Yelp app to thank for this find. 

The ribeye steak is one of the best I&#39;ve ever had and this isn&#39;t even a steakhouse.  The dark rich gravy is amazing.  I recommend getting it on the side though, because you will want to get the full effect and savor at least some bites without the sauce.  Another steak equally as good is the flat iron steak. This steak features a lighter chili gravy. Again, I recommend getting it on the side.  I agree in that I can&#39;t taste the pistachio in the sauce for the pork, but I still really like this entree. Another surprising favorite is the pecan andouille stuffed chicken breast. Chicken is one of my least favorite proteins, yet I love this dish!  I&#39;m not into the apricot sauce; however, they were accommodating in providing a delicious mushroom sauce which complimented this dish superbly.  At lunch and dinner as well lighter sandwich options are available.  I like the filet sliders, the burger, and the pork tenderloin sandwich (add cheese). For a side the creamed kale is a standout.  Creamed spinach is wilted and mushy; whereas, the kale is a little more crisp and has some texture.  

I actually cheated on my diabetic diet one time and ordered the trifle for desert.  This is a traditional English desert featuring layers of custard, cake, and berries.  It is hard to find in this country. This desert is similar to an Italian zabaglione if you are familiar with it.  I bet I haven&#39;t had it in thirty years and it was worth every fraction of an increase to my A1C."

The cocktails were on point, service up to par with the style of restaurant which I&#39;d say is casual/formal wrapped in Geneva-esque style.

And, again it failed to deliver. whew, I do not have to go there again! This time we went at a normal hour, We had the famous brussel sprouts at the outside bar. 

All I can say is thank goodness that the guys at down the bar were hungry wanted the sprouts. They got a bowl full. After two of the sprouts, I was done. They are nothing special. but if you like brussel sprouts with lots of cajun blackened type seasoning on them, you will be in business."

There were people in the group that said last time they were there, they got seated upstairs and couldn&#39;t hear anything that anyone was saying...so, the noise issue is still not solved.

What is solved? Well, the food and service is terrific. We had the brussels sprouts and loved them. My daughter got the flat iron steak, I got shrimp, and we split each so we each got sort of a surf n turf. Highly recommended. For wine we got an easy white (it was a hot summer night)....probably sauv blanc....loved it. Go.

But sit outside."

You have to say that in my Mom&#39;s voice...or any mom&#39;s voice I suppose). Anyway, we walked in and went straight to the bar so we could just grab some appetizers (including the brussels sprouts, obvs) and some cocktails since the craft beer list had a couple decent choices but nothing new for us and we weren&#39;t feeling wine-y.  We ended up getting the mussels, brussels sprouts (duh), a Bloody Mary, and an Old Fashioned. Yeah...we were feeling pretty classy, thank you for asking. It helps that the bar is granite, it&#39;s located next to a cozy fireplace, there are chandeliers everywhere, and the restaurant is a beautiful remodeled old home. Not my typical drinking establishment but I&#39;ll take it. It feels like you&#39;re in a fancy house more than a restaurant which makes you feel cozy but also like you probably should&#39;ve worn a nicer outfit to your holiday dinner. Basically, if you&#39;re fancy, you&#39;ll love it here. If you like dives you might feel out of place. 

Anyway, a quick run down on the drinks, service, and appetizers. Drinks were good, not that we got anything you can REALLY mess up, but the Bloody Mary was nice and spicy with floaty horseradish and celery salt and a nice flavor. I didn&#39;t drink the Old Fashioned but my man seemed pleased. The service was really good; the bar is pretty tiny and there was two bartenders helping us the entire time. The restaurant wasn&#39;t busy so maybe that&#39;d change on a crazy night, but we never had to ask for anything. The appetizers were pretty good too..THANKS, MOM...and I would totally recommend the brussels sprouts. They were sweet and spicy and bacony and crispy and overall delicious. The mussels were good too, although they had a couple of strange additions to the broth I wasn&#39;t sure about...mandarin oranges and jalapeños...which made it good but different. I still mangia&#39;ed on them and soaked up the broth with the bread either way so obviously it didn&#39;t bother me too much. 

Honestly, the Patten House is a really nice date (I&#39;ll have to come back to try out some dinner here) or a super fancy bar to schmooze at, but I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s exactly my cup of tea for hanging out."

THE NORMAL PART: Our friends called - we looked forward to going out for a nice dinner for 4 on a patio.  At 2 PM, we call Patten House and receive a 7 PM patio reservation.  We arrive at 6:45 pm and grab some cocktails at the bar - they were very well crafted cocktails.  We get sat at our table around 7:20 PM - not a problem, we realized they were extremely busy, it is great to catch up with friends.

SERVER IN THE WEEDS: Server was nice but was completely &#39;in the weeds&#39; busy.  He couldn&#39;t quite get to us - but we understood -  we were patient because we have only heard great things about Patten House. The server apologized every time we saw him.  We didn&#39;t care so as this meal was as great as we have heard!

THE APPETIZER TRAGEDY: 8:15 PM we receive the Appetizers. We order the Lobster Mac and Cheese and the Mussels.  Mussels were okay - they only gave 2 little pieces of bread for a table of 4 people.  We never received the bread that came with the meal that is listed on the menu.  We saw other tables receive it - that would have helped with this Mussels bread issue. The Lobster Mac and Cheese had noodles that were underdone.  Mussels were about $14 and the Lobster Mac and Cheese was about $14.  A semi-disappointing $28 spent.  But we ignore it and when this server comes back - we order dinner.

DINNER SERVICE NIGHTMARE:  No one came back for our dinner order until 10 minutes after our Appetizers were complete.  Around 8:25 PM we receive the server back to the table and he takes our Dinner order.  We received dinner at 9:00 PM - with barely any lighting on the patio - we could barely see.  We have been at this facility now since 6:45 PM.  The server came and brought some lanterns, after about 10 minutes of having the food (we couldn&#39;t see our food - it was dark).  Upon the first bite of our entrees we all realized how bad this situation truly was...

THE GUMBO SOUP:  It had undercooked rice in it. All of us ordered it...and it was deemed very tough to eat.  Wasn&#39;t a very good gumbo - mini andouille chunks and sauce.  No real contents to this Gumbo. 

THE CATFISH - $21:  My friend&#39;s Catfish meal was not good.  His rice was UNDERCOOKED, the Catfish was &#39;fishy&#39; and he was extremely disappointed.

THE STUFFED ANDOULLE CHICKEN - $24:  My friend&#39;s Chicken meal was okay - she said the chicken was good - but the side potatoes were COMPLETELY UNDERCOOKED - they were basically raw little potatoes.

THE JUMBO PRAWNS - $28:   Small little shrimp (not prawns) and a barely edible bed of rice (undercooked).

FLAT IRON STEAK - $28:  Steak was good but came out to me cold - the Au Gratin potatoes didn&#39;t seem cooked through - VERY FIRM.  Two cream based sides to this dish - creamed spinach - mediocre.

THE FRIEGHT OF THE BILL:  $250 for this dinner and the cocktails.  After plenty of server given apologies, I decide I am embarrassed for suggesting the Patten House to my Friends so I go talk to the Manager.  Nice guy - says he will give us Beignets to go - I say we don&#39;t need any more food.  He says to come in sometime when he is working and he will comp me a drink - I say, okay - but he gives me no return card to come back, and apologizes because they got slammed.  I told them the food was bad - he just apologized.  I went back to the table.  My Husband and our friend are still in sticker shock by the bill for food that was not good (INEDIBLE, TO BE HONEST), so my Friend talks to the Manager - they take off $28 worth of appetizers from the bill after his discussion.  But honestly - almost all of the food came out undercooked, this really was an awful gourmet disaster.  We were out by 9:30 PM.  2 hours and 45 minutes of fine dining agony.

DEPRESSING CONCLUSION:  I tried to reach out to the Managers to have another discussion VIA email but they didn&#39;t have a website or email address - only Facebook (last updated March 2016).  After 2 face to face conversations with Management that barely made any change to the worst fine dining experience I have had in my recent memory - I decided to write this post.  The Server said multiple times &#39;It&#39;s not usually like this, come back some other time&#39;.  We can&#39;t in our heart of hearts spend another dime at this establishment, so I hope Management can rectify this situation and I would immediately give them another shot to redeem themselves on this (and follow up on this feedback). 

UNTIL I HEAR BACK FROM MANAGEMENT ON A BETTER SOLUTION TO THIS DINNER DISASTER:  Do yourself a favor and go to Fiora&#39;s, Herrington or Niche - these are all fabulous fine dining experiences with food worth the price point paid."

The first time we dined here was the night after our wedding. Everything was amazing. Our server even gave us a complimentary bottle of bubbly to celebrate. 

We decided to come back to Geneva to try out some of the great places we missed the first time, and decided to come here again because of how much we loved it the first time. 

The meal started out good, she had the kabobs (a bit small for the price) and I had the gumbo (really great stuff). We ordered a ribeye medium rare to split for dinner. 

When the steak arrived, it was well done. there was no pink to be seen in or around the steak and the outside was even charred. When the server, Donald, asked us how everything was I told him I hated to say this but the steak is very over done (I&#39;m a server as well and didn&#39;t want to be &#34;that guy&#34;.)  his response was &#34;yeah you&#39;re right, that&#39;s definitely not medium rare. He went back and greeted another table, came back to us and said &#34;well I already yelled at the kitchen once today, so sorry guys there&#39;s nothing I can really do&#34;. I was taken aback. 

The steak was awful, and I paid 30 bucks for it. Pretty much ruined the place for me and my wife. The only reason I gave 2 stars is because the first time we went was great."

 Interior is beautiful and building is beautifully restored.  The menu may  at first appear to be more unique to some diners (I am one such person) but trust me, the chef knows what she/he is doing.  The crab cakes and grits are a special treat.  Who knew grits to could be so yummy and the cakes cooked to perfection.  Also try the sprouts.  Stuffed chicken was superb. Great taste and stuffing just enhanced the overall plate.  Glad I ordered.  Steaks are wonderful, Chef knows how to make a steak!  Menu changes which keeps things fresh.

We sat at the bar almost immediately and enjoyed mixed drinks that were excellent! The bar staff was very attentive!

We sat in the front room of the restaurant and our waiter was twin Jacob. I had already decided on the white fish when Jacob described the Mahi Mahi special, yummmmm! I got the Mahi and hubby got Ribeye. My salad was good, dressing mustard vinegrette was a surprising hit! Of course the bacon wrapped figs melted in our mouth, could have eaten these all night!

I&#39;ll start off by saying the food is tasty, which is why I gave 3 stars. However, the service sucks and I could tell the business in general is cheap. First off, they take forever to bring your food. Overall, it took us about 45 minutes to get our meals. While we were waiting, our waitress brought us 2 biscuits, and they&#39;re mini biscuits mind you. What are we going to do with 2 mini biscuits?! We we starving. So we asked for more biscuits, again she brought us 2. Come on! My husband asked for more because at this point we were going to leave, and our waitress asked &#34;are you sure you want more biscuits, you have a big steak coming?&#34; So finally, she brought us our food and 5 minutes after, she brought my husband ONE biscuit. Overall, I wish I chose a different restaurant for my birthday, but if you enjoy good food but crappy service then this is the place for you. P.s. I would suggest investing in bigger tables on the deck, our plates barely fit on the table to the point where we had to put the plates we were finished with on the side of the deck."

As my mother in law and I walked the stretch of shops we spotted this gem and detoured to see if this was a restaurant. I am not going to lie, the main draw was the building at first. Joy! It was, and they were open for lunch. We gathered the men and stepped back in time to a beautifully rehabbed space, that couldn&#39;t have more ambiance if it tried. And bonus, there&#39;s food!! We all enjoyed our meals, and the portions were so big I had a doggie bag for the next day. Patten House was the perfect lunch setting for our afternoon!"

The general feel of the restaurant is really cool because it&#39;s in an old home in Geneva. I have tried the crab cake and grits and the shrimp appetizer which were both great. Perfect for 2 people to share. 

I&#39;ve also tried the salmon and the red grouper which both came with a vegetable or some form of whipped potatoes. They were both great I would recommend the red grouper it was great. Both times my girlfriend loved her meals as well.

I have also had the creme brûlée which was great. Top to bottom it&#39;s my favorite place to go in Geneva. A must try."

Went in for Dinner on a weekday so it was not super crowded. A restored house, to restaurant, that was built in 1850&#39;s. The inside was nothing but character, with patio dining, dining throughout  the home, including upstairs.

The owner Nancy, greeted us and sat us down. The server, Ostried was right there and provided the most excellent service.

The Restaurant has a Cajun/New Orleans flair and the selections are varied. They brought out Hot Bisquits with a Honey Butter. I then started with the Cajun Gumbo soup. Excellent. The entree was a  Stuffed Chicken Breast, Kale and finger potatoes.  Soup or salad was part of the order and that soup was a large bowl, not a whimpy cup. All Excellent. Also had the Crab Cakes, excellent. Judging by others dining at the same time. All food was rated high. They also had a decent wine selection and the costs are very reasonable. 

A few more things to mention. The bathroom was spotless. The bar area sported a few TVS but seemed it had more of locals hanging out enjoying a pre season football game.

This review is based on one visit, and of course I will return."

Atmosphere/ambiance- fantastic, charming, old worldly with a contemporary twist. Their use of the space could not be better, I absolutely loved it! The bar is a gem, and they make beautiful cocktails!
Food: amazing, flavorful, beautiful! I wanted to try one of everything, so I will be back for more!
Service: well, our server was nice, not quite attentive enough for us. Our appetizers came out quickly, but our soups followed by our main courses came out on top of each other and there was no room for everything and we felt rushed and like we had to gobble down our food just to get some of the plates cleared. We could have ordered more drinks too, but they were getting to us too slowly. We also had to keep requesting water refills...
We went on a Saturday night (and had reservations), and they were busy, so I understand that they were trying to turn the tables quickly, but geesh! I would have enjoyed it if we had better service, and I HATE when my food is brought out on top of the previous course! I think this place is classy enough to know/do better.... 
Great date place, loved it, can&#39;t wait to go back (and have the 5 star experience I think it can be!)!"

We visited here for a work lunch before the holidays and we all agreed on the gorgeous interior (and exterior) being decorated very nicely; it was festive, but elegant.

The service was... not the best. We often felt &#34;forgotten&#34; - multiple times were just sitting waiting for something - and we felt not cared for.

We often had empty water glasses. Multiple people in our party of 5 had their entree dishes...but no silverware, since it was cleared after the appetizers. We had received extra plates...that were dirty. Our waitress didn&#39;t pay attention to detail. We asked what the soup of the day was and she said she had just started her shift so she didn&#39;t know. She would get back to us. And she did...10 minutes later. Also, if she had just started her shift, why was her white shirt all dirty? This is a classy place and she didn&#39;t deliver these standards. Additionally, meals are supposed to come with biscuits for the table, which we had read about and were looking forward to. Well, when we didn&#39;t get any biscuits, we actually got up AFTER we all had finished our meal (because we couldn&#39;t get waitress&#39; attention during it), and had to ask for biscuits. They came once our party was eager to get going. The funny part was, when we were leaving, we found our waitress SITTING on a bar stool downstairs in their &#34;waitress stand&#34; area by the bar...So busy sitting she couldn&#39;t check on us? Patten house receives no stars for service on this trip.

Overall the food was pretty good, but we all had at least one complaint about our dishes. 2 of our guests had the chicken/andouille gumbo and said it was bland and they both hardly touched it.

For the starters: crab cakes with grits was good. The real confusing one is the brussel sprouts. I had been here another time when Patten House was still new (fall 2014) and ordered these. We couldn&#39;t eat them. They were terrible...soggy, drenched in sriracha, just awful. The waiter asked if we wanted them boxed up, no thanks.

But during this visit, everyone wanted to try the brussel sprouts (despite my warning) - they were THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE! They were flaky, crunchy, light pieces, delicious, bacon pieces, balanced flavor, i have no idea what happened the previous time...

As for my entree, I went with the salmon. It was too spicy I couldn&#39;t eat the whole thing. I asked the waitress if it was really spicy beforehand and she said no. The asparagus was tough, sweet potatoes did balance the cayenne kick from the salmon, but still, spicy. The portion was large, I split it into two but never ate the other half.

Despite all of this, we all also agreed that we would give it another shot..."

Thought the atmosphere and cocktails were really good.  We learned there is a now Sunday Brunch, so in the morning we headed here to try a few recommendations the bartender made the night before.  The place takes on a different view during the day, one that we liked and felt really at home here.  Maybe it was the nature of our server, Jonathan.  He was really helpful with his descriptions.

Anywho, I could not wait to try their Bloody Mary, and compare it to the best one I had in N&#39;awlins at Elizibeth&#39;s in Bywater.   Wow...they really nailed it here...it had the horseradish and Worcestershire as I had hoped, and the peppery salted rim was an even better addition. 

Now, on to the best thing we had here....STUFFED FRENCH TOAST!  OMG....so decadent with it&#39;s mascarpone, blueberries, cooked bananas, and ba ba ba bacon! Yes!  We also had the omelet, which was really delicious with its Andouille sausage and different layers.  

Highly recommended Patten House in this breakfast-place-on-Sunday starved-town.  I would also recommend skipping Nosh and get your butt in here instead!   You will leave very satisfied!"

Talk about a cool atmosphere! Beautiful chandeliers galore, a fireplace burning, gorgeous all around. I wish I had a house that looked like this.

The menu is short and sweet - some salads and soups, sandwiches, some appetizers, and a few entrees. Do a few things and do them well. I ordered the Pulled Turkey sandwich with the side salad, and we had the bacon wrapped figs to share. Everything was so good. The sandwich was like Thanksgiving in my mouth - turkey, cranberry sauce, bread, mustard, mmmm. I would definitely order that again. My parents enjoyed what they ordered as well.

The service was great. He was really polite and attentive, always had our drinks filled (which was important because I really needed coffee), and plates were always cleared. The hostess was very nice and had no problem with us switching tables (Dad has a bad back and needed lower seating), and another hostess had a nice conversation with us about the Bears. It felt like home.

I came across this place when searching on yelp. The restaurant is in an old house, which is different but a nice change of pace. Our server was nice and the food was delicious. My fiancé ordered the duck and I got the chicken skewers. He also had the loaded baked potato soup which we both thought was excellent as well as the coconut shrimp appetizer.

I see a really negative trend here with the reviews, I hope the people that own this place take it to heart and fix the disaster in the kitchen before it&#39;s too late.  I didn&#39;t read the recent bad reviews in advance, it does make sense though.

We started with shrimp and grits, it was fine, gumbo could have been more spicy and the salad looked good.  Main courses came, I had the fried catfish, it was $24 and pretty small, food cost on the plate probably $5, not a very good value.  My son had the pulled pork, he said it was good and it looked good with a reasonable price.  My wife had the filet mignon, ordered medium rare, delivered beet red cold in the middle, sent back, waiter asked if they could just refire that piece to save time, ok, we&#39;re not complicated, do it (waiter noted it was raw).  Filet back for a second time, it was unbelievable but still totally raw and not disputed from the waiter, he checked with the manager who removed it from the bill, my wife gave up.

At this point my son and I noticed the manager lurking about but he never came to the table.  We wanted to like this place!  

Not to be deterred, desert, bananas foster were quite good.  My wife ordered funnel cake and ice cream, it arrived after my son and I had fInished ours due to some sort of issue, waiter removed one of the deserts from the bill, manager lurked in the background but no visit to the table.

FIX this beautiful place!

Outdoor dining looked really nice."

The brussel sprouts starter was so delicious!  I went with the mussels starter for my main dish.  The broth was different than I&#39;d had before.  Jalapeno orange - spicy and sweet.

Interior: pretty and different but those chairs are some of the worst I have ever sat on! They are so uncomfortable that I gave them one less star because of that alone. 

Service/Staff:  the hostesses there on the Saturday night we went were rude.  And it seemed like they had a ton of people working at the front but they were just standing there talking.  Our server was super slow and had no knowledge of anything on the menu.  Took about 15 mins to be greeted by her and given waters.  When we would ask for suggestions on items to order she said she hadn&#39;t tried most things. Great help. The bar staff was excellent though - we had a martini after dinner and the bartender and bar back were funny and very nice.

Food:  To me, all of the appetizers tasted the same...same seasonings on everything. The grits were decent but the rest were boring.  The brussels sprouts everyone loves....nothing special. Maybe I just don&#39;t like brussels sprouts.  I had the salmon for dinner and it was average."

Our server, while very personable, took way too long in between courses to take the order for the next course. We waited about 25 minutes after receiving drinks to even hear about specials and to start appetizer orders. When we finally received our entrees, the fish was very tasty. However, the duck, which was the entree we were most excited about, was ice cold. We asked for it to be cooked to a medium rare. When we addressed our server about this, she asked if we wanted to wait to get a whole new order. We said if they could manage to warm up the duck, without sacrificing the medium rare temp, we would be happy with that. Emphasis on the medium rare. 30 minutes later, the duck came out...cooked to death. We told the server, and as we had already spent about 2 hours there, declined another portion. When the check came, the duck was still on the bill. When we inquired about this, the server got visibly flustered, and said her boss was busy, and it would take a while. A while it did take.

2) Solid food. My girlfriend and I did the red pepper bisque, honey Sriracha brussel sprouts and BBQ pork sandwich. Red pepper bisque a homerun, brussel sprouts very good but may try another app next time, BBQ pork sandwich was one of the best BBQ pork sandwiches I&#39;ve ever had.

Give it a rip. We will be back to try dinner sometime. Their entrees sounded phenomenal."

Started out this morning looking to take a little drive and grab a drink or two and some good food in a good room. Hit a home run with this place. First, i hate Brussels sprouts. They have a Brussels sprout appetizer that i ate like i was going to the eclectic chair. Get it. Bacon wrapped Figs, red beans with rice, shrimp po-boy, we had a bit of everything, all great. Finished with some honey covered biegnets. Stuffed, slept through the first nfl playoff game, highly recommended. Great waitress."

1. Beautiful restored old home in Geneva. 
2. Comfy, opulent ambience. 
3. Nice wine menu and full bar. 

Negatives:
1. VERY loud inside: hardwood floors and nothing to absorb the sound. Difficult to hear your waiter or person sitting across from you. (Rugs on floor and window treatments would help IMMENSELY). 
2. In two visits, we had the following occur:
* Once seated, no waiter arrived. We had to go back to hostess stand to inquire about the situation. 
* One visit, the baked Brie was scrumptious, the other time it was room temp and not melted at all. 
* Our meals came before our salads and bread. We asked about the salads and they took our meals back and brought us the salads. They said they would prepare new meals for us (instead of just keeping the old ones warm while we finished the salads). We were charged fully when the bill came. 
* The above problem could very well have been because our waiter was new. This is an easily fixable problem, and he is probably better already with more time and practice."

We started out with a couple of cocktails and the baked brie small plate. Delicious. Hendricks gin &amp; tonic was excellent. My husband had the whitefish with dirty rice and I had the andouille sausage stuffed chicken with creamed kale. Two of the best entrees we&#39;ve ever had. Period. Finished with bananas foster and choc mousse cake. Our server was Cameron; the experience was great from start to finish.

A historic home turned into such a charming restaurant. The exposed brick around the bar, the large, original glass pane windows, the chandeliers...it was all beautiful. 

We started with the Brussels sprouts appetizer, but held the siracha (I can&#39;t do spicy). They were delicious and a very large portion! 

The house salad with citrus basil vinaigrette was good but my friend got the butternut squash soup which was excellent (but spicy). 

I got the steak Tournedos which were tasty. The brie on top was yummy! 

Dessert...you HAVE to get the beignets!"

During the week the overall quality of the food was excellent!  The weekend, they seemed to struggle with keeping up with the same standard.  The gumbo taste to be near burned.  The brussel sprouts, which I have never liked and I loved here on Tuesday,  was just sub par on Saturday. 
The coffee was luke warm and I&#39;m not sure if that is because we were on the second floor and the coffee has been sitting in a pot for awhile.

My poboy was good, friends enjoyed the grooper. The salmon was a bit overcooked but the beinets were excellent.

Overall,  I would visit again but during the week."

Everyone in our party had something different and each dish got rave reviews.  The pork chop and catfish were awesome.  The prawns were great.  Apps were also perfect too.  

I read some reviews that complained about the lighting and the noise level.  I guess both complaints are fair - it is noisy and somewhat dark in certain spots.  So, if you are 80 years old and don&#39;t like noise and have trouble reading a menu in a dimly lit room - this is not your place.  But, if you want great food, in a really cool rehabbed mansion, and you can tolerate a pretty lively (maybe &#34;loud&#34;) atmosphere - I highly recommend this place"

I&#39;ve been wanting to go here since before they were even open. We finally went, after hearing great reviews from everyone we spoke with. I loved the atmosphere and the service was good. 

Everyone I was with got sandwiches and loved them. I got an entree with soup. The stuffed poblano pepper and the soup was ok nothing amazing. It was all blain. My husband offered his sandwich to me, so we switched. He will eat anything and is not picky. He didn&#39;t eat much and asked if I was full because he wanted his Po&#39; Boy back. We all were shocked he didn&#39;t finish my pepper - he said it wasn&#39;t good either.

Hoping my food next time is better.
We also go an appetizer, it was the bacon wrapped figs, we all really enjoyed them. However, what isn&#39;t good wrapped in bacon."

You can make it whatever kind of experience you want. My husband and I enjoyed a romantic dinner, the table next to us had their whole big family there, and on the other side was a girls night group! 

The complimentary cheddar biscuits were delicious! We then ordered the Brie appetizer... Wow! It was in a puff pastry and I could have eaten that for dinner! I never order fish, but it was the waiters recommendation, so why not?! I got the grouper and was hooked from the first bite! It had a slight spicy kick to it in a great way. The sweet potato purée was to die for. My husband got the salmon and said if he ordered that every time we go, he would be completely satisfied. As if we hadn&#39;t eaten enough... We got the chocolate mousse cake for dessert and scraped the plate clean. 
Service was impeccable! 

Now the question is... When do we go back?!

Really loved the house and service. The food fell a bit short. My husband had jambalaya and it was a bit bland. I had the salmon with way too much mashed sweet potato on the side. It could have been more flavorful as well. Salmon at Pappadeaux is soooo much tastier.
We started with cocunut shrimp that was awesome and the much buzzed about brussel sprouts. The brussel sprouts where good, and the portion was huge. Would I order them again or rave about them... probably not.
We were too full for dessert.
Will I come back? Yes but either for brunch or just for drinks and appetizers."

The restaurant is located in an old home from the 1800&#39;s that has been completely updated in the downtown area of Geneva. The tall ceilings with the archways over the doors are a wonderful throwback to a different time. It really adds to the atmosphere.
Not only that, but the food is wonderful as well. I had a blackened grouper with avocado infused whipped potatoes. Yum! I started with a cup of their gumbo which was tasty as well. My table-mates had a filet done completely the way he wanted and the other had a shrimp dish that he enjoyed as well. 
Our waitress, Kristen was fantastic, very friendly and helpful. Great service. 
The only minor bad point is the wine list was a little on the short side, I enjoy a pinot noir and they had only 2 selections by the glass. But the one I had was fine.
Prices are a little on the high side but what you&#39;d expect of a place of this type. I will definitely go back."

We loved the cozy, intimate feel of the place. Instead of one large dining area, the building is still broken up like a house with just a few tables in each room. The property is beautifully restored as well with a warm neutral color palette, bright fixtures and exposed brick walls.

The food? Some of the best anywhere! We started with the Honey Sriracha Glazed Brussels sprouts. The portion was generous enough to provide for leftovers for our party of two and they were absolutely superb. The complimentary biscuits were some of the best I&#39;ve ever sampled and I loved how they paired the biscuits with lightly flavored butter. We both opted for the dinner salads because the gumbo sounded incredible, but it quickly became clear that this is a place where the portions are generous and we wanted to leave room for the main course.

My mom had the fried catfish which came with a homemade sriracha tartar sauce and unique Cole slaw with apple slices in it. I had the white fish which came over Cajun style dirty rice with marinated green beans. Everything was outstanding and our waiter was super attentive. He provided us with an amazing desert menu (which seemed to rival All Chocolate Kitchen with crème brulé of the day and various other gourmet goodies) but we were too full.

My only complaint is that the chairs are horribly uncomfortable. They&#39;re the Colonial style that fits the period of the house but they&#39;re horribly straight backed. If they had a coat check they&#39;d probably be more comfortable because my coat hanging over the back of the chair kept pushing me further forward.

Absolutely will go back again though. Might have to try their breakfast sometime."

Sadly, this evening indeed constitutes one of those times. My husband and I called ahead and asked for a table for two- that was easy and quick no problem. When we arrived, we came 10 minutes early so we sat at the bar and got a drink, again no problem. The catastrophe started when we were seated... We brought our half empty drink from the bar over, and ordered an appetizer since my husband had never eaten at the Patten House. We were prepared to drop $120 for a meal for the two of us. We told the waitress when she comes back with the appetizer that we would order our meal. We got our appetizer 10 minutes after we ordered, and after we were given the wrong &#34;small plate&#34;- again we&#39;re easygoing so we didn&#39;t mind... But then, we noticed that our waitress had gone to the table next to us three times since our appetizer was delivered (by a buss boy not our waitress)- and we started to become impatient... I decided to time how long it would take someone to simply ask about our beverages, let alone get our meal ordered... In total we waited 35 minutes before I got up and left, mind you we never were attended to again. I could have walked out without paying for our appetizer, but I chose to hand the hostess a $20 on our way out, covering our small plate and tipping our waitress almost 100%... Because clearly this establishment and our waitress needed the money more than us. I work in the service industry and could never imagine servicing a guest like this. I am almost ashamed to wonder if part of the reason we had such poor service is because we are a homosexual couple. Is Geneva that behind? We wanted a fun date, and unfortunately left hungry and dissatisfied with a very bad taste in my mouth from The Patten House."

There were &#34;hidden eggs&#34; scattered around the front lawn filled with jelly beans, hula hoops and bubble wands for the kids (and maybe I blew some bubbles too). They had a small brunch menu along with their small plates and entrees. We skipped the small plates and had entrees that can with yummy biscuits and house salads with a tangy vinaigrette dressing. My filet was perfect with yummy green beans and Yukon gold mashed potatoes,a very nice sauce and the biggest hit, fried parsnip straws. I could eat a plate of them. My Easter Bunny honey had the prawns over a avocado mash which was also delish. We had the lemon mascarpone cake for dessert. Not too sweet but luscious. All in all, a wonderful Easter lunch. Folks have mentioned that they feel the decor is too plain but I think it&#39;s just right. I love to see the exploded brick, woodwork and cool chandeliers. Can&#39;t wait to go back."

I expected it to be pretty great judging by the reviews. I ordered delivery which came pretty quickly (about 30mins). I ordered the Linguini with clam sauce (white), jalapeño poppers, and fries. The poppers were well done and cheesy. Yum. I was skeptical about the fries because not everyone gets it right but i was very pleased. They are crisp and yummy without the strong potatoe-y taste you get from many fast food places. NOW THE PASTA. The pasta comes with garlic bread which was nice but the pasta WAS NOT GREAT. It was a very generous amount which would have been great if it tasted good. I almost called them to ask if they forgot to put the white sauce on the pasta (haha). It was extremely bland and a little too al dente for my liking. I wish I had tried their pizza instead. It looks yummy. 

Overall, I think I will give them another chance with PIZZA and apps. I don&#39;t think I will be ordering pasta again."

I then asked if she could take my order and make my food at 11AM and she was bent out of shape. I am not sure how this lady ever became a manager but she has no clue about customer service. Also beware as there prices as the menu prices differ from the actual prices at the store and the website is under construction, which means they can change prices whenever they want.

Ordered a double-dough pizza, wasn&#39;t super impressed by the sauce or crust. Above average, but not by much. Would&#39;ve been a little more generous and given them 4 stars, but the delivery guy also decided to hit on my wife while he was here, making it the longest and most awkward delivery she&#39;s ever had to endure. Hadn&#39;t heard that many pick-up lines in a row since sitting through an episode of The Bachelorette. So when you order delivery, be prepared for that little bonus."

We&#39;ve ordered from here twice and have had both their double dough and thin crust pizza. All of their ingredients are fresh and delicious. The first time, I had the double dough with pepperoni, black olives, and ricotta. Last night we tried the thin crust with just pepperoni and black olives. 

Delivery is MUCH faster than Rosati&#39;s and much better tasting. This is most definitely &#34;our&#34; new pizza place. The bf&#39;s mother ordered from there last night and now she&#39;s hooked! We also were able to sample the jalapeno poppers, which did not disappoint.

Thank you Cassano&#39;s for using fresh quality ingredients. Your pizzas remind me of the long lost childhood years, back when pizza really tasted amazing and not like the pizzas of today&#39;s standards. Your delivery drivers are friendly and helpful. Keep up the great work!"

I went here for a quick lunch stop. Got a slice of pepperoni and a soda for less than $5 bucks, that&#39;s a damn good deal. The portion is very generous. I was excited to give it a try. At first inspection, I couldn&#39;t see any pepperoni, found them sleeping under the blanket of cheese. I&#39;m not a fan of toppings under the cheese, I don&#39;t feel that the heat well and crisp like they should to really bring out the flavors of the meat. The cheese, yeah there is a lot of it, almost too much. It overpowered every bite and left my mouth battling the chew. The cheese kinda tasted more processed than it should and lacked some salt to bring out the flavor. Crust was nice, thin and crisp. Actually I really liked the crust. The sauce wasn&#39;t too acidic but lacked any punch when it came to full flavor. 
All in all, it&#39;s a good deal for a quick lunch pick up, but it&#39;s not all that. Less cheese, more toppings, and seasoning please!!"

The tomato sauce is one of the best I&#39;ve had.  What was good about the crust was it was able to hold up the cheese and topping.  However,  the crust itself was kind of tasteless, like a doughy cracker crust.  

Definitely will try some of the other items on an extensive menu."

Based on all the stellar reviews on Yelp about their thin crust pizza and banging chicken wings, I bit!

Ordered Buffalo style wings with blue cheese sauce.  Nothing unique here.  

Well the pizza was mediocre slathered in a sauce that was too sweet and not fresh tasting...but horror of horrors it was cut in squares and for a Brooklyn pizza pie eating woman that is criminal!  The wings were soggy and totally forgettable!"

Pound for pound best pizza outside of city limits as far as I&#39;ve found. I&#39;d be willing to put it up against any other joint in the burbs. 

Nothing crazy but the consistency in which you&#39;ll get a great product goes A LONG way. Everything feels homemade love the sauce (try a side of marinara you&#39;ll see), crust is right on, sausage great and that&#39;s just the pizza. I&#39;d also recommend the wings and Italian sandwich though I&#39;d shy away from the garlic bread. 

The owner is cool at least I think he is the owner. You&#39;ll see him in there working every weekend. Respect. 

Also if you want to get hammered at a dive bar (whites tavern) and get a slice through the sliding window this is the spot. Lol. 

Small counter to eat a slice but this is take out/delivery spot for the most part. Unless you&#39;ve had too many PBR&#39;S the it&#39;s both at White&#39;s. (Not repping White&#39;s here as I have never been)"
cassanos-pizzeria-naperville,Alex K.,t8KYrch5MJmu7BpTcLgHFQ,"Lisle, IL",0,1,0,1,54,qmp6Ep0XKz7n7dxqQOwtUQ,4.0,2016-02-13,"My wife and I moved to Lisle about a year and a half ago, and ever since have been searching for our &#39;go-to&#39; pizza joint.  Al&#39;s Pizza in Warrenville is hands down the best, however they don&#39;t deliver and sometimes you just don&#39;t feel like making the drive to pick up.  We&#39;ve tried all the local joints - Evviva, Passero&#39;s, Lucano&#39;s....all of them solid to good, none of them great.  

I&#39;ve driven past Cassano&#39;s in Naperville on too many occasions to count as I&#39;ve lived in the area for my entire life, sans a few years in college, but never eaten there.  One night I was driving home on Ogden and saw another Cassano&#39;s in Downers Grove.  Relatively close to home, I made a mental note to find out if they delivered and give it shot next time we ordered pizza.  Looked them up on the web and saw that it is the same Cassano&#39;s that is in Naperville with a second location.  The DG location seems much closer to our house, so I dialed the number for that one (or so I thought), but the woman answered &#34;Cassano&#39;s Naperville.&#34;  I decided to ask if they delivered to Lisle, and she said it depends on the address.  Gave her mine, and she said no problem.  Success.  

I wanted to try a few things to get a good feel for their food.  The wife was out for the night and it was just me, but I wanted to try a variety so I ordered way more food than one human could possibly consume and planned for plenty of leftovers.  I went with a thin crust meat lover&#39;s pizza (normally I like one meat and lots of veggies but the wife prefers meat and I knew I&#39;d have leftovers.)  I also got a small BLT pizza (one of their many specialty pizzas - comes with (of course) bacon, lettuce, tomato, and mayo along with their regular sauce and cheese.  Wanted to also try a sandwich so I threw in a cheesy beef for good measure.

Deliver was pretty prompt and the food arrived piping hot.  The driver was a middle-aged gentleman who was extremely friendly.  Asked me if it was my first time ordering and when I said yes he proceeded to thank me and give me a run down of some menu items that he recommended, walk me through the coupons on the menu, etc.  I am wondering if maybe he was the owner?  If so, and he made the delivery himself since I was a first time customer, that was a really nice touch.

Onto the food.  The pizza was fantastic.  Nice crust, perfect sauce (zesty, flavorful, not too sweet), abundant cheese and toppings.  Cooked perfectly and hot.  The BLT pizza was DELISH.  The bacon was nice thick, meaty pieces of well cooked bacon that wasn&#39;t too crunchy, just how I like it.  Not the finely chopped up, thin bacon you get from most pizza joints.  Every bite of this stuff seriously tasted like you were eating a really phenomenal BLT sandwich.  Yum.  The cheesy beef was quite good too.  Good amount of beef, plenty of cheese (i.e. - you could actually see it melted over the sandwich and taste it in every bite!)  Bread was excellent, had a really nice chew to it and while it didn&#39;t specify this on the menu, I think it was garlic bread. My only minor complaint was that it really could have used some au jus - it was served dry.  I&#39;m guessing I probably could have gotten a cup of au jus on the side for dipping had I asked?

We ordered a 2nd time a couple nights ago.  Got a large thin crust with a couple toppings, it was just as good as the meat lover&#39;s the first time around.  Again fast delivery and piping hot!  I also got an order of wings as the deliver guy had recommended them the first time.  I&#39;m a wing freak and pretty picky.  These were very good.  They offer a lot of options (plain or breaded, sauced or sauce on the side, etc.)  I went with breaded wings tossed in BBQ and a side of bleu cheese.  They were well cooked, had a great crunch, juicy and excellent flavor.  My only small complaint was that they were a little oversauced - this took away a bit from the nice crunch on the outside.  But, minor complaint, I will definitely order the wings again.  We also got an order of fried pickles. Nice size serving for $4.  They were a bit overly salty, but dipping them in the side of ranch helped out a bit.  

Now, for the only reason I am deducting a star.  Upon that 2nd order, after much deliberation the wife and I had initially decided to go with the Cheeseburger Pizza, which sounded awesome and we figured would be as great as the BLT pizza was.  Upon calling to order, the gal on the phone informed me they &#34;didn&#39;t have&#34; the Cheeseburger pizza.  She named off some of the specialty pizzas that they apparently did have at the moment, but we ultimately just ordered a regular create your own.  This confused me - do they not make the pizzas to order?  Were they out of some of the ingredients they needed for that pizza?  When she said they &#34;didn&#39;t have it&#34; it almost seemed like that meant they were pre-made and didn&#39;t have that. Odd.  Sorry, but if it&#39;s on your menu, I should be able to order it.

That aside, thumbs up!  I finally have my go-to pizza delivery joint!"

And though their staff was very friendly, their pizza did not meet expectations. I ordered a thin sausage slice. The pizza didn&#39;t have much sausage on it and it lacked seasonings and spices in the meat. The sausage itself was fairly bland. The crust tasted like it was from pre-made frozen dough. Like what you get in the freezer section of the store. I was really hoping it would be great. I am still in search for the best pizza in lisle/naperville.

  Most were good for awhile-we patronized Uncle Steve&#39;s exclusively for many years (it took a precipitous decline after it was sold) and most recently Aurelio&#39;s (super expensive and saltier than the dead sea) -but with most small businesses or franchises as it were, it&#39;s difficult to stay on top of the game for a long period of time. And we were at something of a loss as to where to get a pizza last weekend.

I had heard of Cassano&#39;s, and the Yelp reviews are good, and I have friends that share the surname (Joe the boxing trainer), so we gave it a whirl.
We went with a family, thin crust pepperoni and an order of baked ravioli.
When I went in to pick it up-I&#39;m too cheap for delivery-I was impressed with the price. $29 all in.  Very reasonable comparatively speaking. And both the pizza and the ravioli were outstanding.  The pizza was cooked to perfection with a nice rigid thin crust and slightly browned cheese.  The sauce is very good.  And although the ravioli was a bit soupy, the taste and texture of the pasta was outstanding.  We have a new regular pizza place."

Wings are soggy so skip them.

Customer Service is BIG in my book and this store lacks.

I called because I was over-charged compared to my online receipt.  I was informed that I cannot get the 10%off plus free delivery.  Well, I never put  in a code for free delivery...it was automatic $0 when I checked out!  

Then I was informed my order went to the wrong store, which she admitted was an online issue since I had input my zipcode upon ordering.  

Yes, she thanked me for bringing these &#34;issues to their attention&#34;.  NO, she did not offer to reimburse me for the discrepancy and make any attempt to hold me as a repeat customer."

I get the deluxe with mushroom, green pepper, onion, sausage and bacon. Their bacon is so. good. Food is always piping hot when it&#39;s delivered and I&#39;ve never received a messed up order.

We tried many places and we were disappointed until we found Cassano&#39;s. We have only had the thin crust but it&#39;s so good, it has become our staple Friday night dinner. We have tried several combinations and my favs are sausage, green pepper, onion and mushrooms; godfather special; and margherita pizza.

If you order online they have coupon codes you can use during your order. We have had great service with the exception of one time when our order was never put it. After waiting over an hour we called to inquire, they apologized and comped the meal.

I havn&#39;t tried too much on their menu but I have tried the pizza, aranchini which they no longer have which I&#39;m mad about it was great, and their spaghetti special. I love getting a slice for lunch. Great big slice of pizza for like $3 or $4 with a coke. Their pasta special on I think Tuesdays is awesome as well you get a couple pounds of pasta, great meatballs and like half a loaf of garlic bread. A ton of food for like $6 and a really good deal as well. It&#39;s pretty much take out only though I think you can order food at the bar next door, never done it myself though. Really good unique pizza though. Definately recommend giving it a try. If you work for or own cassanos and are reading this bring back the aranchini."

How did I not find you sooner?  First off, as previously mentioned,  it&#39;s located next to the White Tavern.  After placing your order you can go to the Tavern, enjoy a refreshing beverage (or plural) and simple wait for the bell to ring alerting you that your food&#39;s ready.  Could there be a more inventive concept?!  I was just about sold at this point, but tasting the pizza really sealed the deal.  DELICIOUS.  I could hardly believe how good it was...in fact, I salivate just thinking about it.  My fav is the thin crust, which is cooked to perfection, but if you&#39;re in the mood for stuffed, skip Giordano&#39;s and give it a try.  You&#39;ll be pleasantly surprised, it&#39;s equally as good as the thin crust.  Hands down, my new go-to pizza place."

Ordered online, real easy with a 10% online coupon code everything was smooth. Got half pepperoni half sausage, double dough. Online told me 20 minutes, but I got to the store and found out that it really takes more like 25 with double dough. No huge deal, I&#39;d rather wait and get fresh pizza. However, without the double dough, I&#39;m pretty sure I timed the trip perfectly which would have meant more time to eat on my break than wait at the store :) I did notice that they have one of those fancy machines to stretch their dough which made me sad... I have no experience in how that affects the taste/quality but I like the idea of someone doing that by hand. Idk why...
Double dough looked AWESOME. Very homemade... I was SO excited. But the crust by itself didn&#39;t taste like anything...like at all... with sauce and cheese and whatever, the actual pizza part, it all blended alright. But the plain part... bleh
Sausage was pretty good. Tasted fresh and cooked perfectly. I would 100% recommend their sausage. Pepperoni not so much. #1 under the cheese... had I known I would not have ordered that :/ I like it crispy, but that&#39;s cassano&#39;s style so I can&#39;t knock too hard for that. I know that somewhere out there, there are people that like it that way. #2 SUUUUUUUUPERRRR salty. I drank my whole water within probably 4-5 bites. #3 it&#39;s true, they do put a fair amount of toppings on there compared to stupid chain places.
Cheese puffs were good... maybe a little bit overpriced? I was expecting something homemade at $1/puff.
Overall, if someone told me they were ordering Cassano&#39;s for a party I wouldn&#39;t be upset so long as there was sausage, and I could bring my own coke (they sell RC... which uhh no thanks... and that also explains how they can make their lunch combo so cheap). BUT I&#39;m not going to go around ranting and raving about this place... nor am I in a rush to go back. Especially since all the specials listed on their menu are mostly for sandwiches and not pizza. Basically, I think there are better tasting pizzas in Naperville, but it&#39;s not the absolute worst."

I am very skeptical about pizza.  They are above average in price and taste.  I ordered a thin crust 4 topping pie.  The crust was flat and crunchy but not over cooked or brittle.  The first day is best!  The only con about the entire pie was re-heating it the next day.  You could see that the cheese was that slimy translucent color.  Which means they use a mozzarella blend instead of 100% real cheese and it&#39;s not the real deal cheese wise, which makes it disappointing the 2nd day."

Then she said we&#39;ll I guess I can send him back but how do I know you will be there? I am like WTF I am calling you, were the hell am I going to go??? I gave my number again she sent the guy back. I was waiting outside for him. He was nice enough and I gave him a good tip for having to drive back, however when I told him that I saw him the first time when he was driving by, he said &#39;sure you did&#34; Whatever, I don&#39;t need to be talked to that way, there are way too many other places I can order from.

I had the walnut, blue cheese and greens salad.  It was OK but nothing special.  My wife ordered veggie tacos and thought they were just OK.  She thought the rice that was served was very good.

Ellyn&#39;s has a good beer list, but so do a half dozen bars within 20 minutes of them.  All in all, I&#39;m not impressed and our server&#39;s disposition was only a minor part of the 2-star rating.  

For those that feel I am being harsh on our server, Deena, I am very understanding of those who toil in the hospitatility industry.  I tolerate a lot and brush it off.  We were a polite foursome, not demanding and I don&#39;t appreciate her brusque treatment.

The music wasn&#39;t too loud, so you could still focus on your pals or watching one of the TVs.  They had a good selection of beers on tap, and my friends liked their mixed drinks.  When our food came out, I was impressed at how good everything was.  My Reuben sandwich was awesome, as were the sides.  Everyone else loved their dishes.  I&#39;m glad that there was a tasty and fun option to get dinner at, late at night, because I haven&#39;t had as much luck at finding good eats after 11pm in the area.  I&#39;m glad my friend suggested Ellyn&#39;s Tap &amp; Grill!"

Found this place on Yelp. We didn&#39;t realize at first that this place is in a strip mall. 
Walked in and the bar was kind of dead for a Friday night. We sat at the bar and were greeted by the bartender. He gave us the drink menu and we asked for the food menu too. 
The place is not bad looking, plenty of seating and they have tvs. There was music playing from the &#34;jukebox&#34;. 
They have a nice selection of beer and cocktails. 
I ordered the sliders and my boyfriend got a salad. Both meals were good. 
I liked that their kitchen was open late and I liked the selection of beer. It is close by but I don&#39;t see myself going back there unless it&#39;s to watch a game on TV. Good food, good drinks, ambiance was just ok. If you&#39;re in the area and are looking for a bite to eat and a place to have a cold one, definitely stop by."

PLUUUUUSSSS our waiter, Tim, was literally one of the greatest waiters I&#39;ve ever had.

I&#39;m certain there was only one cook in the kitchen too. We waited over an hour for our food and it ended up being mediocre. Such a bummer!"

The Sync system in the F-150 dredged up myriad local fast food establishments (the casual dining options in the western suburbs are really quite pathetic, I might add), and one of the few non-chain options was Ellyn&#39;s.  We headed over, and I was a bit apprehensive when I recognized that it was a strip mall establishment.  But we checked it out, and are happy to have done so.  It is bar centric, with a comodious, centrally located drinking pulpit and numerous HD flat screens, i.e. the decor is consistent with what you might imagine of a neighborhood tavern.
I was thrilled that Oskar Blues was a featured brewery, and I encouraged the bar keep to look into the G&#39;Knight Ale (the personal preference). The Dale&#39;s Pale Ale was quite nice, however.
We ordered the Tempura onion rings, and they were pedestrian, at best.  And the Wasabi dipping sauce was more like bottled ranch dressing-heavy on the cream, very light on the wasabi.
The tacos, however, were really tasty.  I ordered the Mahi-Mahi tacos, and my wife had the veggie tacos.  Both are nicely prepared, presented, and delicious.
The staff is friendly and attentive.  This place has legs."

The first two times we&#39;ve been there, it was always SLOW. Yet we continue to give it another chance. However, today was the LAST straw. Will not be going back.

We were seated around 12:10, took about 5 minutes to be recognized. We ordered both drinks and the meal at the same time. It seriously took another 10 minutes just to get our drinks.  Since we were thirsty, we downed our drinks and they sat empty for another 10 minutes. Food still never came out and it was about 12:40 by this point. We had to be back at the office by around 1. This was becoming a joke. Our server took some of the blame, but we never saw a manager.  We eventually had to get up to flag our server down at around 12:45 and just told him to box our food up to go and not even bring it out. 

We will not be coming back as much as the food is pretty good, the service here today just sealed the deal that our office wont be back."

Pulled pork sandwich was tasty &amp; tender, but the bun smelled extremely strange. I was hoping I&#39;d get over it, but I couldn&#39;t shake it off and decided to take it off. Salmon was very good. I loved the corn and sweet potatoes it came with. Their pretzel is wonderful, I recommend it. Their tots tasted like tots. 
Service was horrible, (we sat at the bar since it was so empty) and it took us 10 minutes just to make contact with the bartender, and remember- it wasn&#39;t busy, hence why we sat at the bar, so they didn&#39;t have to cover a lot of ground to get to us every time they wanted to check in on us. Took another 15 minutes to get our order in, so I sat &amp; watched workers come in and out of the kitchen, bringing food out &amp; eating same food off their friends plates, chit-chatting away. Normally I wouldn&#39;t have cared, working in a casual environment &amp; seeing friends makes working late a lot better.

3.  A quite place to meet clients/associates

We went later after working late and errand running. We knew wanted a place with good food and that catered to a late night crowd (kitchen open late, etc).

We were greeted pretty quickly after entering and seated right away. Full disclosure: our server, Eric, is an acquaintance of ours through a mutual friend. None the less, he is an awesome representative of what Ellyn&#39;s strives for, in my opinion.
We were lucky enough to go to Ellyn&#39;s  two times and both times Eric served us. He talked us through the menu both times, knowing we had not been often. He shared with us what he loved to eat and why he loved it. I like that, it is nice to see an employee excited about the food at an establishment.

The first time we went we ordered the ITALIAN BEEF EGG ROLLS - $9, POT ROAST SANDWICH - $11 and the CAPRESE BLT - $8. (copied right from the menu so you can see how reasonable the prices are). We had NO complaints about the food, there isn&#39;t anything we would change. We both chose tater tots and were impressed with how many came with our entree. We both took half of our sandwich home and were pleased with how they reheated.

Back to last night we ordered ITALIAN BEEF EGG ROLLS - $9, SRIRACHA CHICKEN - $10 and FISH AND CHIPS - $13 (again, look at those awesome prices!) and once again were over the moon at how good our selections were. The chicken was cooked perfectly, and so tender! The fish was beer battered and plentiful and cooked just right. My husband was very pleased with the choice he made to order the fish. 

Both times we went my husband took advantage of a drink special and I ordered a Coke. We felt like our bill was right where we wanted it to be. 

I love that the staff was friendly and that servers who weren&#39;t our own smiled at us and interacted with one another around us. It was such a pleasant, fun experience both times and I can&#39;t wait to go back!

Mediocre food served by surly waitresses.  Good luck even getting a clean glass for your beer.  Speaking of which, there&#39;s an extensive beer list, but your server likely won&#39;t know a damned thing about any of the beers on it.

To me the atmosphere is fairly laid back, tons of tv to watch sports, SPORTS! It rarely get too loud.

What makes is place so great is the beer menu and the food. 

They are always bringing in so many craft beers both on tap and in bottles and cans. The variety is actually really great. 

To me the food here is simply great! Best &#34;bar&#34; food in the burbs easily. The burgers here a good, the homemade soups are good too. But really the best part of Ellyn&#39;s is the steak sandwich with parmesan truffle fries. Seriously the best steak sandwich I&#39;ve had. The parmesan truffle fries as outstanding as well. 

The only draw back is the service at times is inconsistent. Not saying it&#39;s bad but sometimes the wait staff seems to disappear half way through your meal. It&#39;s become a joke with my buddies to load up on beers as the food arrives because it might be a while before we see them again.

Overall, it&#39;s a great place to go and grab and bite, get a drink or watch a game.

It seemed to be quite an employee hangout.  Difficult to tell who was working and who had ended their shift.

The parking lot is usually full, however it&#39;s deceptive, many of the cars are actually for the local hair salon and Yoga studio, so fear not you probably will be able to get a good seat at the bar, high top or booth.  

While the selection is good, they seem to not understand what a fluid ounce is.  They have under poured multiple times, and when paying $9.50 for a 11 oz. beer you should get 11 oz and not 7 oz beer and not foam in the remainder of the glass.  I suspect that the kegs may be kept too warm perhaps.  Having been to many craft beer bars and this is the first one that I&#39;ve noticed that does this.

The menu at Ellyn&#39;s is similar to that at Warren&#39;s but less gastropubby and more regular pubby.  It was still a decent menu, but I really would only go for the appetizers or the burgers as there weren&#39;t any cool specials (like poutine...DROOL.)    

The beer menu though?  THAT is where it&#39;s at at BOTH places.  Like Warren&#39;s, the menu is about 4 pages long and is broken up into categories of beer styles (and has the gravity, ibu, and abv for you!).  They have an excellent draft menu and their bottle list is even more impressive.  There are good local brews on there and a really nice variation of styles.  If you like beer, you WILL find something great on this list.  (Yes, I copied that pretty much straight from my Warren&#39;s review.  Sue me.)

Overall, I like the food and the vibe more at Warren&#39;s but Ellyn&#39;s ain&#39;t bad either.  Beer is 5 stars, the place and the food are 3?  I guess that makes Ellyn&#39;s a 4.  You won me over with that beer list, Ellyn&#39;s...tricksy, VERY tricksy."

We just moved to the area and heard this was a good place to go. We both love beer and the beer list is huge! They have a lot to pick from, it&#39;s almost overwhelming.  We both found something we liked.

We ordered appetizers. The nachos and the parm chips. Both were great! The chips came with a spicy ranch sauce which was great. The nachos were huge too. We don&#39;t know why we ordered actual food.

I ordered the chicken fajita wrap. It tasted just like a fajita. I had no complaints about it al all. It was also huge. I picked tots to go with it which were also good and crispy. My fiancé ordered a burger with bacon. It was huge too and he enjoyed it. No complaints from him so it must have been good. 

I can&#39;t wait to come back and taste more beer. We also liked that there were Tvs everywhere. We were able to watch a little bit of a game which made him happy. 

Service was also great. We were served by a young man. He was nice and attentive. He made sure we got samples of anything we wanted to try.   Can&#39;t wait to go back."

It was moderately busy for a Friday night but we got seated right away.  Our server was really on top of things and we got our orders in and out to us very quickly.  It seemed like they had folks walking around the floor, ready to anticipate people&#39;s needs and that is a very good thing.

The wings were pretty decent - the chipotle sauce and the hot buffalo sauce had pretty good flavor without melting one&#39;s face off.  And, as someone who is not a fan of meat off of the bone, the wings themselves were pretty tasty.  I had the cheese steak sandwich, which was loaded with meat and cheese, and the tater tots, which are always a good thing.  Dessert was the bread pudding, which was probably my favorite thing of all.  Dense but not too rich and just sweet enough - loved it.

The beer list is pretty good if you like craft beer - lots of Revolution on draft and a fair number of other options, many local, both in cans or bottles and on draft.  

It&#39;s definitely a sports bar and there are TVs everywhere so you can get your sports fix - something to keep in mind if you&#39;re not a fan or if you *are* specifically looking for a place to watch a game.

Definitely somewhere we will go to again."

Service and atmosphere extremely  friendly and efficient (unlike Tap House).  Food was absolutely phenomenal.  I had the Monday special ($5) which was the Classic Burger with Tots and my daughter had the skirt steak sandwich with fries.  Both were perfect.  The bread/buns they use are clearly high end and really made a difference!  I also had a bloody mary that was reasonably priced and very good.  Beer selection looks very good and they have daily drink specials that are well worth it!  Our server Heather was funny and friendly and it was a great experience.

I definitely have no problem agreeing to come back -- in fact, if my friends mentioned that they were planning to go here, that would be a bonus when deciding whether to join them. The beer list is large and varied, and the food is good. I especially like the burger with bleu cheese. Don&#39;t let the strip mall appearance fool you -- this is one of the best places in Glen Ellyn. 

I have noticed that this pub doesn&#39;t seem to have as many children in it as some of the other places in Glen Ellyn. That is a very big plus to me. I think I&#39;ve only seen two kids in there. The Tap House always seems to have loud kids (at least, it used to -- I haven&#39;t been there in a long time), and there are kids in Shannon&#39;s and kids in the North Side bar. Until I was 30, I lived in a state in which it was illegal for children to be in a pub, and I honestly just don&#39;t like it. I have always thought that pubs should be places where you can be assured of being away from screaming children, and it bugs me when there are children in a pub.

The one down side is that the service is sometimes a bit spotty. I feel like I&#39;ve had to look around for a server at some point nearly every time I&#39;ve been there. And once I had to go to the bar to ask for the check. But the staff has always been very friendly and polite, and with me that certainly makes up for any inefficiency. I don&#39;t mind going to the bar to ask for the check if I&#39;m greeted with a pleasant smile."

The interior is essentially a large room.  The central bar area is surrounded by high boy tables, larger restaurant rounds and booths.  There are also little nooks hidden in the back corners of the restaurant for larger groups of people.

The drink specials were pretty solid: ranging from $2-4 dollars daily for bottles, drafts or well drinks. The place fills up pretty quickly, especially for their Trivia Nights.

Ellyn&#39;s food is disappointing.  Their best menu item, by far, is the Cajun Chicken sandwich.  If you&#39;re a sandwich or burger eater, trust me and order the Cajun Chicken because the rest of the menu is mediocre.  The burger is very run of the mill, the Turkey burger looks and tastes as though it was microwaved from Trader Joe&#39;s, the Southwest burger is okay, the Heart Attack burger is pretty good.  The Buffalo Chicken, Steak Sandwich, Pulled Pork and Fajita Wrap sandwiches are all underwhelming primarily because they don&#39;t include enough meat or fillings in them. Another tip is if you order out, they really skimp you on fries.  I&#39;m talkin&#39; they only give you five or six pieces.  It&#39;s only funny because I&#39;m not exaggerating.

The redeeming factor for Ellyn&#39;s is their servers are very friendly.  It&#39;s truly a local bar and grill, at its heart, which is great if you live in the area.  All-in-all, skip it unless you live or work in close proximity."

I used the YELP app and found this little gem nearby.  I was happy to see a good sized craft beer menu with the special of the day being 3.50$ craft drafts.  Our server &#34;Paige&#34; was great, we threw a lot at her but she never had to write anything down and everything was perfect.  The beer was cold and the  food was all very good with some unique bar food selections.  There is a TV positioned in every direction you look, which would be great for game day.

The staff is great, attentive and knowledgeable.  Although there were a couple of times where I felt like I was bothering them (probably because I was lol).  

First of all the location of this place was hard to find.  If my bf wasn&#39;t from Glen Ellyn I probably would&#39;ve given up.  It&#39;s on the hill in a strip mall.  Once you get there though you&#39;ll see it was worth all the turns and twists.  

It&#39;s bigger on the inside than I thought it would be.  It&#39;s got a dark but friendly feel.  Although I do feel like they want to be more of an adult spot but they can&#39;t because they are in Glen Ellyn which is a super family friendly town.  

The food is delicious.  Although I am a creature of habit and have only gotten the wings I have tried my bf&#39;s selections and they are equally as yummy.  Now I say &#34;I&#39;ve only tried the wings&#39; as if that&#39;s a bad thing it isn&#39;t.  Mark my word these ain&#39;t no bdubbs pigeon wings.  These are meaty well seasoned, yummy sauced and GREAT!  The wings alone are worth the trip!  

I do wish this place was in a different location.  I want them to have a beer garden but they can&#39;t due to their location.  I mean they could but who wants to be in a beer garden that over looks a parking lot.  Not sexy.  But hopefully they will expand and get a better spot, one that is worthy of this great up and coming bar."

     Over the past several months, they&#39;ve gutted their food menu, and what remains is mediocre at best.  But my biggest issue is with the staff. The last four times I&#39;ve been there its gotten progressively worse.  The bartenders have gone from attentive, to inattentive, to irritated, to ignoring.  There&#39;s one guy in particular, a Jason Priestly looking guy with a beard, who is especially bad. I don&#39;t need you to be happy to take my drink order but you don&#39;t have to be irritated when I ask for a drink at a bar either.
This last time we went in was the NFC Title game.  We walked in and got two seats right at the bar, which should tell you something considering it was Sunday night playoff football.  We sat at the bar for over five minutes without even an acknowledgement from the guy, let alone a drink. He only seemed to pay attention to one half of the bar while moseying about, slowly doing his business. Two other girls had empty bar napkins and no drinks.  We finally left after probably 10 minutes and I doubt he ever saw us sitting at his bar.

Fortunately this pub is family friendly (i.e. Crayons for the kids). We typically get sat in the back (probably because we bring our toddler), which is more conversation friendly anyway. We always get wings as an appetizer. The pineapple habanero are excellent. We also typically split a burger, too. The truffle fries are a little too oily for my taste, but have good flavor.

Yes, the place is about 80% bar, but they have big cushy booths. It&#39;s pretty much seat yourself, but the waitress greeted us right away. Service was pretty good throughout the evening, with our waters staying filled and a good amount of attentiveness.

As for the food, the menu is fairly simple but has some good variety to it. We started with nachos, I had the caprese BLT, and my husband had the &#34;ellyn&#39;s cheesesteak&#34;.

Nachos: Good chips. Plenty of pico and a HUGE pile of guacamole. Very good overall, but the guac seemed like it had been sitting out since morning -- it just had that vague &#34;not quite fresh&#34; look to it. It still tasted pretty good, though. All in all, some good nachos that bordered on great.

Caprese BLT: Um, YUM! Thick pieces of fresh mozzarella, fresh basil, lettuce, tomato and nice chewy bacon on grilled sourdough bread. (Skip the mayo. You don&#39;t need the mayo.)
Tots: Dude, they have tator tots! Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, just right.

Cheesesteak: It met my husband&#39;s standards for a tasty sandwich, though if you are a Philly girl like me, just forget about it being authentic. Tasty and authentic are two different things.
Homemade chips: Very good. Just the right thickness. Still trying to figure out why they came with avocado salsa.

All around, good food, friendly atmosphere, I would definitely come back.

(Note to drivers: the Yelp map is a little weird and misleading. This is in the Baker Hill shopping center, just WEST of 355; you have to turn onto Baker Hill Drive to get into the parking lot.)"

  Who ever is messing with the menu must be putting what he likes and not the masses. He is obsessed with blue cheese and fish. What&#39;s going on here? They have four entrees on the menu three are fish and one flank steak. Really!  They used to have some bar greats and now they are gone off the menu, Reuben egg rolls, cheese curds, pretzel sticks and old style beer. These have been replaced by mini corn dogs and frozen pretzel from the microwave. 
  The staff is great.  But I have noticed if you start to like something here whoever big brother is will take it away from you.

Try the Italian Beef Egg Rolls if you ever have doubt.

I mainly go to bars to find a good comfortable environment with welcoming regulars and great staff.  This is exactly what you will find at Ellyn&#39;s Tap.  There&#39;s even a dart board if you venture to a far enough corner.

The owner Jerry is a wonderful man and occasionally will sit down with you at the bar and share a drink and talk about a good craft beer.

However, the last few times I have gone in it seems impossible to get more than one beer. 
It seems to be the same bartender every time I go in that slacks off while the other is running around the bar and taking tables.

Lets realize that this is a Sports Bar.  Now with that being said, this sports bar has GREAT FOOD!!  I know sports bar food and could probably complain about something at most of them, in regards to food.  I have had many many meal at Ellyn&#39;s, and everything I have ordered is delicious.  It makes me not want to stop ordering while there(and makes me want to go back when not there),  portions are always enough to satisfy, pricing is right on and you won&#39;t go broke, and I always leave with a smile!!

The bar itself is medium in size.  Nicely done with a nice bar set in the middle of it all.  I have always found it to be looking clean and well kept, which even includes the large bathroom.  Now this is a sports bar, so YES, it has plenty of TV&#39;s.  I can&#39;t say that I have ever had a seat that I didn&#39;t have a decent view of a TV to watch a game.  Now pay attention......This will be the only, close to negative, thing I will be saying.  If you are viewing &#34;the Game&#34;  and are sitting at the bar, you may have a bit of a crick in you neck by the end of it.  The TV&#39;s for the bar are set quite high, so you are looking up quite a bit.  My recommendation is to order a cold bottled  beer and ask them to leave the top on.  Apply to back of neck.  Problem solved!!  

Ellyn&#39;s is in Baker Hill Mall.  Although it is a nice little mall and very close to my home with plenty of parking, I have often thought that because it is up and kinda tucked away from the large traffic volume of Roosevelt Rd, if this doesn&#39;t actually take business from them!?  I truly believe if they had better exposure, that this place would be packed constantly.  Then maybe that is the plan and they are letting word of mouth and reviews like this slowly build this awesome bar!?!!  

I almost forgot the staff.  Always friendly and great service!!"

If I knew there was one so close to home sooner, I would have partaken in this guilty pleasure of mine on a more regular of a basis.  

This place is nothing like the Mr. Submarine I vaguely remember from my days of reckless drunken abandon.  The floors, tables, and restrooms are clean and inviting, and the staff was relatively friendly (even when dealing with a belligerent customer who just could not understand that &#34;chopped ham&#34; was not a beef product,) and it was not chock full o&#39; the drunken and high.  (Perhaps going at three in the afternoon instead of three in the morning reduced that factor.)

The food is still good, if not better, than I remember.  The menu is large, with all kinds of different deli meats and cold cuts.  My husband ordered a Steakburger sub, which is a pressed, seasoned ground chuck oval, served warm on a bun.  I went for the corned beef  sub, with only onions (which are sliced super thin and stringy) and extra sauce.  (Not sure what the sauce is made of besides oil, which turns your sandwich into a giant, yummy mess.)  I also had some of their chicken soup, which was surprisingly good.

Thirty napkins later, I finished my sandwich with a smile.  I was happy to have reconnected with an old flame.  Since they are open until 4:00am on the weekends, I can go whenever the craving hits!"

It&#39;s typical greasy fast food, and I felt kind of horrible about myself after eating here.  The portions are ridiculous, Fat American portions.  Portions are more appropriate if they&#39;re shared - and then it&#39;s a REALLY cheap meal.

The Chicken Philly (with mozzarella and green peppers) was good.  I asked for the regular bread, but I got garlic bread, and it was much too greasy for my liking.  I ate most of the chicken and peppers with a fork instead and tossed the rest of the bread.  

You can&#39;t miss with cheese fries, and the guys working here slathered these fries in a thick layer of melty cheese.  I would go back just for the cheese fries, they don&#39;t skimp here.  But you&#39;ll need someone to share the mountain of fries with.

The prices are great, it&#39;s cheap food, and they&#39;re open late to cater to the night owls."

The after-party was at Mr. Submarine. 

I wasn&#39;t invited. 

No, I&#39;m kidding. But three of my friends, and party guests ended up here after the party for some late night grubbin&#39; and after seeing their social media pix, I needed to try it and needed to try it right quick. 

And after not getting to bed til about 4 a.m. the previous night, I&#39;d decided I wasn&#39;t doing anything that didn&#39;t occur in pajamas. Thankfully Mr. Submarine has a pretty loose dress code (and also a drive-thru). 

Being my first time, I just ordered a regular old Mr. Submarine combo. They didn&#39;t have Coke or Pepsi products, but some off brand that tasted terrible. 

The sub itself was okay. Nothing really special. I asked to have it warm, but the cheese was still cold and unmelted when I bit into it so I guess warmed means warm meat? Not a fan. 

Fries were average and fine. Service was good. I waited, but not an obscene length of time. 

I think I&#39;d definitely give them another try, but it&#39;s not going to be something I&#39;m too excited to try again immediately."

Being that he knows a lot about everything, I figured I&#39;d check it out after my friend&#39;s party. I love that they&#39;re open late so you can come and eat at any level of inebriation that you choose. My level was low, since I was driving, but I can&#39;t say the same for my guest.

We decided to go with the hot pastrami (also again on Andres suggestion) with a chicken cheesesteak on garlic bread. Andres forgot to mention that the proper way to order the cheesesteak is on the white bread, NOT the garlic bread. 

The pastrami was delicious. I wish they put more meat on it, but that could be just me being greedy. Pastrami + mustard are perfect together, although one more scoop of meat and one more squirt of mustard would have been made this even better for me. The cheesesteak wasn&#39;t what I expected. We did have to wait awhile because the grill was turned off, but we were warned and didn&#39;t mind waiting. The garlic bread didn&#39;t mesh well with the flavors of the steak. I believe it would have had a lot different taste if we would have went with the regular bread. I loved that white bread they used on the pastrami with the sesame seeds. Yum

Since we were eating past our bedtime, I turned down fries but I immediately wish I would have tried them. They have RC Cola products which screams meh to me, but we went with water anyway.

Overall, a pretty decent sandwich shop that&#39;s open later than those other sub shops. If I ever get invited to his house again, I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to stop in to the corned beef or regular cheesesteak."

I used to frequent the one in Berwyn, as I spent a good portion of my twenties in the area. Since then, it had been quite a long time since I had one of their sandwiches, and one day the craving hit. No way I was going to drive to boofoo for one, and I was excited to see this location in DG. Without hesitation, I trucked on over.

This location has a drive-thru, but I opted to go inside, as I knew I&#39;d need a few minutes to look over the menu. I&#39;m not one of those morons that pulls up in a drive-thru and sits there for five minutes deciding on my order. If you can&#39;t commit to your meal in under thirty seconds, go inside folks. Don&#39;t make the people behind you wait forever just because you&#39;re indecisive. 

I ordered a regular Mr. Sub with everything, and added hot giardiniera as well. I also opted for a side of Mac &amp; Cheese Bites. The cashier was friendly, but between orders, she&#39;d flirt with her coworkers and have personal conversations that patrons could obviously hear. It was a bit awkward, as there were only 3 others in the restaurant besides myself, so you could hear every word. Finally my order was ready, so I grabbed my food and made my way outside.

First I checked out the Mac &amp; Cheese Bites. Reminiscent of the Arby&#39;s &#34;Mac &amp; Cheesers&#34; (yeah, remember them), they were hot and gooey. A side of Ranch is included for dipping. 

The sub was great. Just as greasy as I remember from ordering them at 3 a.m. after a night  out in the bars. The addition of the hot giardiniera was the perfect accompaniment to the meats and veggies on the sub. The only part I forgot about these subs are that they look deceiving. I was only able to make it half way through my sandwich before I was full, and I didn&#39;t even get the &#34;King&#34; size. I wrapped up the other half to save for later.  

I&#39;m so glad there&#39;s a Mr. Submarine in the area. Next time the craving hits, I will certainly make the short trek back here."

Well, mom-and-pop&#39;s are local with limited hours, but this place has locations with late hours.
Between the quality of bread and quantity of meat between &#39;em, this place is worth the trip.

Comparing to other chains:

Jimmy John&#39;s - Too expensive
Quizno&#39;s - If you can find one, even then the subs are too thin and stale after running through the conveyor belt toaster oven
Pork Belly(or whatever their name is) - Brown-bagged subs are thin and almost resemble what you find at a local Jewel bakery section with one of those ready-made rip-off ones. 
Corner Bakery - Is more of a sit-down place than a take-out, that is if you do not mind paying at least $10+/order with chips and a drink
Go Roma - Only if you live up in the Northshore, and even then is more of a fake Italian cuisine type
New Jersey Mike&#39;s - If you like soggy subs
Firehouse - If you can find one, where the portions are really small
Scrubway - No need to ask;  between the $2.00/6&#34; and $5/meals, you get what you pay for
Mariano&#39;s Deli Section - Went from $3.50 to near double now, might as well get something from their hot bar at that point"

I threw out the other half of my sandwich.  I always get a king size roast beef sandwich because it is the best.  I can never eat all of it, but that is okay because I always save the other half for the next day and it is just as good. 

I stopped in for my favorite sandwich about a week ago and got my usual.  It didn&#39;t taste good from the beginning.  The bread was obviously stale which has never happened at any Mr. Sub that I have ever been to no matter what day or time I have eaten before.  Also, the lettuce tasted like maybe it had been frozen before. It tasted like water and made my sandwich kind of taste like water too.  I was so unimpressed with the first half of this sandwich that I just tossed the other half knowing that I wouldn&#39;t eat it the next day.

This location should take note of how the other locations run things.  Any location that you go to in the city or even the one in Lyons has phenomenal sandwiches.  It is great that we can have this in the burbs, but not if it doesn&#39;t come close to the original."

I&#39;ve been to lots of Mr. Subs...yep I get around...Lincoln Park, the Loop, Lyons, Brookfield, Berwyn and Downers Grove.  The DG location has a drive-thru window.  Yee ha, how cool is that?

You can&#39;t go wrong with any of their subs or salads.  My favorites are the veg, gyro, super sub and pastrami.  Their garlic fries are legit.  Hell, I love everything Mr. Sub serves me!

You know what? I think Mr. Submarine could kick Jimmy Johns, Mr. Potbelly and Jersey Mike&#39;s asses down!  Yep, Mr. Sub is my man.  My big, strong man. You will not find a better sub for a better price in the Chicago area.  Plus, all locations are open super late and remember this one has a drive-thru.  Props to the super nice staff here.

Sure, my usual selection comes with what you might expect, but the kick to this Sammie is the green and banana peppers that go along with it.

Although I stick with the tried and true, they also have quite a few sub options; drink and choice of chips follow along and Mr. Submarine offers a two for $5 special pretty routinely. What I also found was that here, two halves really do make a whole. My sub was so packed I took half home.

I also like this particular spot because the turn over of ingredients is excellent and the guys at the window are friendly and fast, almost to the point of superhero status.

Thanks guys!"

I was very impressed with their big menu and selection of subs. I ordered a gyro sub and some breaded mushrooms. My order came out very fast, and the sub was awesome! Their cucumber sauce was very creamy and garlicy. The meat was tender and juicy. The batter mushrooms were very good as well, not soggy or tasteless. My husband had a turkey sub with crispy bacon and he really loved it as well. I am looking forward to going back and trying some of their other menu items!"

After confirming that this was it, I knew I had to stop there. I grabbed a sub for my husband&#39;s lunch that he takes to work, and I tried the Chicago hot dog/fries and an order of the breaded cauliflower. My meal was so good! The hot dog was true Chicago style, down to the celery salt on top, and came with a ton of fries. My husband was thrilled to get the sub (the regular Mr. Submarine) and thoroughly enjoyed it. The breaded cauliflower was a generous order and came with a dipping sauce, but they are seasoned nicely on their own and super crispy and tender so I never ate the sauce. What stood out even more were the prices. I was shocked at how cheap it was to enjoy a really great meal. We live about 20 minutes away but we&#39;ll absolutely be back. Next time I&#39;m getting this magical sub that everyone raves about. I love finding spots like this!"

I don&#39;t need a fancy presentation or aesthetic surroundings to appreciate the cuisine that I eat. They have an excellent selection of subs that give you a HUGE bang for your buck, the bread is soft and of great consistency, their vegetables are so crisp and fresh, and their meats are phenomenal! If you aren&#39;t in the mood for a sub, they have literally everything else under the sun (hot dogs, fries, gyros, etc.)! If you get the fries, ask for that Cajun seasoning, it&#39;s unreal.

I am told that a building that is just about 3/4 mile East of here- it&#39;s where an original twin-peaked-roof Mr Submarine was (the bldg still stands at 500 Ogden). I may have bad info on that, but you ought to go and see that architectural dinosaur. But that is the past ! 

I believe the resurrection is perfection.

The staff here is all about service and keeping the seating area always clean, they deliver food to the table when the need arises, and the new menu is great! A great bunch of kids that actually recognize the regulars very quickly. 

I was a Subway regular, but I have seen the light... I think it&#39;s a better value, and they play good music from the 60&#39;s-90&#39;s.

The only way to make it better? Those perfect pickles need to be refrigerated and ice cold. I know- they won&#39;t spoil at room temp, but that would make it a total 5* rating for me.

-------UPDATE------ I just gave them 5 Stars, they now have iced the pickles!

My favorite? The Pastrami heated up, chicken soup and diet RC Cola. That&#39;s my lunch about twice a week. 

The &#34;chopped salad&#34; is enough for 2- lots of chicken and bunches of other goodies.

And yes... Diet RC Cola.... it&#39;s an acquired taste, but it works for me. (better by far than Diet Coke)

Fast service, clean, good food... what more could you want?"

Yesterday was a bit of time travel for me when I stopped by the Downers Grove location.  I ordered the regular Combo which comes with roast beef, corned beef, cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion and mustard.  Their bread is a distinctive Turano &#34;hoagie&#34; style bun with sesame seeds.  I ordered a value meal which comes with choice of fries, chips or soup and a drink.  I went with the fries.
The Combo was pretty good with a nice balance of meat versus veggies.  Unlike Subway, where they give you PLENTY of lettuce, this sandwich had a nice portion of meat and cheese.  Although I did enjoy my sandwich, it didn&#39;t knock my socks off.  The meat was relatively bland.  The crinkle-cut fries were perfect and a much better choice than a bag of chips.  My total was $6.15.  Their subs are much better than Subway, Quiznos and Jimmy Johns but the sub sandwich playing field is becoming more and more crowded compared to even 10 years ago.  A-OK is a fair review."

I&#39;ve had it before in the city and remembered as nothing special. I have to say the first thing I noticed is price. I had a regular salami sub and a pickle for less then 5 bucks. The quantity was great and I loved the sauce and bread. Like some have said, it&#39;s nice to get a sub with lettuce that isn&#39;t swimming in the lettuce. I&#39;ve had their regular fries and they are delicious. I want to try the garlic fries, dipped beef sandwich, and gyros next. Only complaint is the location can be a bit difficult just because of traffic, but this is no fault of the proprietor!"

This particular Mr. Submarine has both a drive through and a decent number of tables to sit down and eat in at.

Upon entering Mr. Submarine I noticed that they in fact serve hot dogs and decided to try the hot dog and fry. For only 2.29 the hot dog and fries seemed like a good deal. The hot dog I received came on a non-poppy seed bun. But the bun was soft and was tasty. The celery salt was visibly added to the dog, the application of mustard, relish and onion was perfect. One thng worth noting about the onions is that they used string onions rather than chopped or diced onions like must hot dog places. I suspect these are the same onions used on their sub sandwiches. The pickle was just the right size and wasn&#39;t too sour. 

The fries included were of the crinkle cut variety and  a little soft and a little salty. Overall I was very impressed by Mr. Submarine&#39;s hot dog. When you consider the fact that you get a hot dog and a great number of fries for only $2.29 this is a fantastic value as well. I would definitely come here again and definitely recommend it."

We then had the burgers and they were all cooked well done whether you ordered medium rare or medium well. I got the FAB burger that was killed  by over cooking and had no taste. Just a gray piece of meat with no flavor and they didn&#39;t even put the blazing mayo on it that was the signature sauce. Not sure if the order was punched in wrong or the cook just does not know how to make them. Just mediocre at best. There are much better places to eat."

We have them in the Phoenix area but never went to one because well you know! The wife! But since I was in Chicago, and this location was across the street from where I was staying.

THE GOOD:
Their Tilted Kilt original wing sauce is awesome. Its a sweet and spicy sauce that I can&#39;t get enough of. 
Their chicken wrap is also very good.
Plenty of beer on tap
The bar has great service
THE BAD:
In the dining area, servers are not that great. Some tend to leave you alone and you have to ask to get some help at times. 
Their burger is OK, just nothing special.
THE UGLY:
Just funny to see not all but a bunch of men who thinks they are in love with some of these girls! Of course they&#39;re giving you attention. Bigger tips!

Overall had a good time, plenty of flatscreens to watch a game and plenty of beer to enjoy."

The last time I was here was the final straw though. I don&#39;t know if it was the kitchen or bartender&#39;s fault, but I sat around for about 15 minutes after ordering the fish and chips only to find out that they were out. 

It&#39;s not that big of a deal that they were out of something, but the  time to find out about that is now when I&#39;m thinking my food is coming out. I ended up having to order a second one of their comically large beers. The food is not all that great but it does do the trick.

The inconsistency of their beer specials makes it confusing for the servers and customers who frequent many of their locations. TK Bolingbrook didn&#39;t have the beer Jason wanted and I couldn&#39;t order the Watermelon Shaker because they were missing ingredients. 

What saved my boyfriend and I from apprearing like we were giving Ana a hard time was the manager on duty. He just happens to also manage the TK in Oakbrook. What they offered in Oakbrook a few days ago wasn&#39;t available in Bolingbrook today.

My boyfriend ended up ordering the Bentley Margarita. One of the few drinks to offer his favorite brand of tequila (Don Julio) and I ordered their regular house Margarita on the rocks with salt. They made up for the other nonsense."

The main reason why this place is so great for me is the company I come here with. The service is below average unless I got a server whose name I believe is Rachel.  The environment is very man cave-esque, with banners/flags hanging from the rafters and ball games on all the TVs.

We&#39;ve always had a decent experience with food and service. A few months ago we came in and they were running a promotion where if you received a &#39;card,&#39; you would receive 40% off your bill every Sunday (and they boasted it would never expire), which included food AND drinks. Since then we&#39;ve frequneted several Sunday&#39;s and have enjoyed ourselves. It&#39;s kid friendly and a nice place to catch a game. 

Today.....that all changed! We went in for a late lunch with the kids to watch the Hawks game. When we were going to pay the bill, the server stopped over and said the manager would not honor our card since they were under new management. We were really disappointed and said we wanted to speak to the manager. This was really the only reason that we came in for lunch on this Sunday afternoon and it is not our fault they were under new management. As soon as the &#39;GM&#39; stopped by, he immediately put us off. I told him that the right thing to do was to honor the card this time, but let us know going forward we would not be able to use it. He was SOOOO unprofessional and went into this long story where theTilted Kilt is under new managemnent because the previous owners had not paid the rent for months and they hadn&#39;t paid their servers. I told him we understood their situation, but we are patrons keeping the business alive and it isn&#39;t our responsibilitiy of their past mishaps and they should honor the card. (as we had it in writing), at least for this visit. The manager felt we were attacking him and he was being so unprofessional. He was NOT acting like a GM and we told him so. He took the bill and said he would see what he could do, He came back and told us he took 40% off. By then, he was completely irriatated with us. Hello - we were there on a Sunday afternoon with our 2 kids. You would think he would do whatever he could to save the customer (considering we are regulars). 

After looking at the bill, he took $17.50 off of our $100 bill. We questioned him because it did not equate to 40%. He told us he never said he would take 40% off the whole bill and only gave it to us off of the food. (Even though the card was good for 40% offf food and drinks).  Overall, he was just a jerk and clearly does not know how to handle a customer. He was so unprofessional. He told us we should take it to the top.....which is exactly what we will do. We tried calling Tilted Kilt Corproate today and they were not open. This post does not serve justice as to the poor level of service we received by the GM today. We also saw him several times just sitting at table among the patrons appearing to be working (looking at paperwork, spreadsheets, etc.). Don&#39;t they have a back office for that?? 

We came home and &#39;googled&#39; Tilted Kilt Bolingbrook and apparently they are in the hole $170K for not paying their rent. After our experience today, we definitely will NOT be back....EVER.....to any Tilted Kilt. It is unfortunate. Over the past several months, we were generally there once a week. They&#39;ve lost a returning customer."

The first time I ever entered this place was on a Tuesday at about 2 in the afternoon. There were more girls working than customers so me and three of my friends sat at a high top table as instructed by the hostess to sit where we like. After about five minutes of not being greeted by a waitress we walked out and went to another TK&#39;s across town with much better service. 

The second time I ate here hoping to find better service and to lazy to go else where being that it&#39;s right next door from the hotel I was staying at I was delighted to have a very cheerful waitress. She had been the hostess from the time before and I believe we were the first table she had ever waited on and although she didn&#39;t do a great job at timing my salad before my meal made my over all experience pleasant. 

The third time was a night mare, it was a packed house on a Friday night so the wait for my beer was expected to be long and it was. I wanted to get some spinach because I had just worked out at the LIFETIME fitness right across the street. I requested this to the bartender who rolled her eyes and acted like she didn&#39;t just here what I said and replied with a snide, &#34; excuse me?&#34; I explain that I would like a bowl of spinach leave with some ranch dressing and piece of grilled chicken on the side. Maybe not the thing to say on a packed night but not an impossible task and wouldn&#39;t have slowed the kitchen down at all. When it arrived my chicken was cold, this didn&#39;t matter to me because I was hungry and needed fuel. While I was finishing my spinach a women from the end of the bar was using profound bar mouth that could be heard from where I was sitting on the other end of the bar with all the noise of a full house. My friend being a southern gentlemen that he is didn&#39;t think a lady should be speaking in such a manor let alone while he was eating his supper asked the bar tender if she could ask her to quiet down. The little bartender went down there and started talking to the women who became apparent  to us she knew very well. Well they started pointing fingers at us and old trash mouth jumps out of her seat and made a v-line for me. She started ranting and raving about god only knows what which caused my friend to become irate. He shut her up pretty fast but by that time her boyfriend had walked over and asked if we had a problem. Now is time for a little about me. I&#39;m 6 foot 210 pounds and climb cell towers for a living. I am not a professional fighter by any means and try to avoid confrontation but by no means am I afraid of it. I went from facing the bar with my head turn to this trashy women to sitting straight up with both shoulders facing him and told him there wasn&#39;t going to be if he got well the getting was good. Lucky for him she wore the pants and he turned and walked away and she proceed to follow must likely for the first time in their relationship. The service went down hill from there and we left after we had finished our meals 

Now what I should be doing is writing a letter to there corporate explaining everything in grave detail and get the little bartender who egged on this situation fired. But I&#39;m writing this instead because bar tending at TK&#39;s will be the high point in here career."

Not this specific location but tilted kilt in general.. I was really curious about these famous grilled wings so we ordered half of those and the regular ones. What is weird is the wings can only be ordered by pound which I&#39;ve never seen before so for two of us we shared a pound. I honestly can&#39;t remember the sauces we got but I feel like one was medium and the other was sweet and spicy. Either way, the sauces weren&#39;t memorable and the wings were whatever. We also got the garlic fries which were really tasty but kind of soggy but that could have been because we got take out.

It&#39;s nice that the girls are hot but please just fill an empty glass.  

The problem was, she wasn&#39;t great to begin with and then they must be trained to serve the waitress stand first.  So obviously it took forever. 

Still, like a moron, I went back the next night.  This time the service and the food:  both awful.  The TK Pub burger was on a stale bun, way over cooked, dry, bland and no way a 1/2 pounder.   I had an empty beer on the bar edge for 15 minutes.  Me and the guy next to me (both empty) were laughing about it.  Finally I couldn&#39;t take it anymore and every time she came by I yelled CHECK!   After 2 or 3 of those she printed it and threw it at me.  $30 no tip. 


Worst part:  I left my cell on the bar and had to go back in.   It was at the hostess stand but man did I look like a jackass.   Six hot girls watching me come back for it (yes they were smirking as I left)."

Then we got a waitress who clearly didn&#39;t want to be there. I ordered my usual beer but when my friends hadn&#39;t figured out what they wanted in about 10 seconds she literally rolled her eyes. When we did get our drinks we had to wait about 10 minutes after finishing them to get another. The waitress couldn&#39;t have came off with a more &#34;can&#39;t-wait-to-leave&#34; attitude. The service and the girls they have working there have been going down hill for awhile now, but this one was the straw that broke the camel&#39;s back for me. Me and everyone I went with this last time vowed to just take the mile long drive down the street to the Buffalo Wild Wings from now on."

When I stopped in for a quick lunch the place had just opened and was packed. My server was very nice, took my order quickly and then came back to chat for a couple minutes. She took the time to answer all my questions about the restaurant. The conversation ended up turning to our dogs as she spotted a picture of mine on my phone. It was pleasant enough.

I ordered a Pastrami sandwich. I&#39;m sure I could have gone to a hole in the wall deli and gotten twice the sandwich for half the price. I would not have been able to enjoy it with an ice cold beer and the view would not have been as nice. It&#39;s now been a month or more since I&#39;ve been back.

Sat at the bar because we usually get better service. WRONG. We saw on the board 40% off Sundays ask your Tilted Kilt girl for more details. Well, my boyfriend and I did. Jasmine had no clue. Her explanation let us confused. She just stated to us something about a card you can get and that she doesn&#39;t work Sundays. We then ordered our food. We asked for our pretzel to be our appetizer. Well food came out and no pretzel. She was like Oh Shit I forgot. We told her to forget it. She went to her manager and told him. He offered to put it in and give it to us for free. We were like ok. Meanwhile another guy came up to the bar and obviously wanting beers. He stood there for awhile ignored. The bartender and manager were both too busy doing shots with customers at the bar next to us. Finally the man had to yell excuse me really loud to get her attention. We also had to listen to the bartender swear like a truck driver while flirting and having lengthy conversations with the guys next to us. She was in no way professional. We then asked her again about the 40% deal. She was like oh yeah you guys want cards right? We were like yes. She then proceeded to take our bill and bring us back a new one with the 40% taken off. If we never asked about the 40% she would never of gave it to us or given us cards for future visits. My boyfriend asked her about several different beers on tap and her response was I don&#39;t know how to describe how beer tastes!! Really??? She also had no clue about the menu. She was asked about the wings and how hot the mild was and her response was oh they are not hot at all. When my boyfriend tasted them he compared them to Hooters hot wings. He asked for a water and she forgot to come back with it. He had to ask again. Then he wanted another beer after we got done with dinner. I had a full beer in front of me. He sat there ignored for a long time. Finally she came back over took his glass and never came back!! Never asked if he wanted another beer and didn&#39;t even give him a chance to ask for one. That was the last straw. We put our credit card out to show we were ready to leave. Ignored again for several minutes. Finally we had to yell excuse me to get her over. We were going to stay and have more beers but not worth it!!! I have worked in the service industry as a bartender/server for 15+ years and this was by far the WORST service! I understand they want girls who look great but they should be able to bartend and multi-task. Needless to say have a brain!! We stiffed her. It takes alot for me to stiff after working in the industry for as long as I did. She was left a note telling her she gave crappy service and to read the review left on Facebook for her. I have seen many bad reviews for this location as I was writing this. Doesn&#39;t seem like the General Manager of this store cares???? We are leaving a comment on the website for corporate so we will see if we get a response. I read other reviews in which they never got a response!"

They have a big selection of drinks here too. 

Out of all the local restaurants service here is the best.  Its very easy to be in and out the door if u want to be. I&#39;ve been here many times and regardless of how busy it is they&#39;re generally quick.

About a year later and I think it may actually be worse...

Stopped in for a couple beers and apps because we were in the area. The bartender was an ugly person inside and out. First, she gave me a hard time about ordering a shot. Then I overheard her talking to another patron about how she hates people who talk loud and swear... well, you work at a bar with a questionable dress code, not a Sunday school... so suck it up! Needless to say, we will not be back... for real this time.

On a side note, I&#39;ve complained to corporate and never received a reply. If they can&#39;t return an email, I won&#39;t return to their business. Nuff said.

Original:
Went here on Mother&#39;s Day afternoon. First, we found out if we sat on the patio, we couldn&#39;t drink because they don&#39;t have the proper permit. So what&#39;s the use of a patio?
So, we got a table next to the bar. We browsed the food and drink menus and decided what to order. The only problem was, nobody ever came over to actually take our order. We watched the bartender and hostess walking about, but no waitress. We noticed that there were only a couple occupied tables and a few occupied chairs at the bar. After a bout 15 minutes of being completely ignored, we decided to leave. The real kicker was when the hostess- the same woman who had seated us 15 minutes earlier- chirped &#34;Have a nice day!&#34; to us as we were leaving.
It may have been a super experience, but I don&#39;t intend to return after that visit. I may try the Kilt at the mall, or return to Seven Bridges- I have had good service there on a few occasions."

First time was takeout and we were honestly surprised at how good it was. When you&#39;re used to average Asian takeout, you have a certain expectation. They far exceed typical Asian takeout food. On this visit I had the roasted duck over fried rice....AMAZING. Not just the duck either. The fries rice was amazing. My daughter got the curry crab fried rice and she couldn&#39;t stop talking about how good it was. 

So we went back, this time to dine in and brought my extended family. I don&#39;t remember the name of our server, but this gentleman was awesome. He was funny and just all-around a great server. On this trip I had the yellow curry which was fantastic.

We will order here frequently. Love to find our Asian food fix spot."

My experience is solely based on my pick up order, but after visiting the restaurant itself I can say it&#39;s a quaint little spot to grab lunch or dinner.

I was able to order food right on my Yelp app thru Eat24 which is super convenient. My husband and I are creatures of habit when it comes to Asian food, so we both ordered our usuals -- crab rangoon, pad kee mao, and beef and broccoli. Plus, if you check-in on your Yelp app you get a free order or vegetable egg rolls!

It took about 30 minutes for my order to be ready, and it was there waiting when I stopped in to pick it up. My pad kee mao was very good, however it was extremely spicy. I know it&#39;s a spicy noodle dish, but when ordering it gave me the option to select a mild, medium, or hot spice level and I went with mild. YEAH. Definitely not mild! My meal was for sure packing some heat. It was still very good, just wish I didn&#39;t have to drink so much water to eat it!

The crab rangoons were small but very tasty. Crunchy on the outside and a nice filling on the inside. The veggie egg rolls weren&#39;t my fave, but my husband liked them just fine. Overall, it was a great option for not having to cook! Portions were big, ingredients fresh, and it didn&#39;t break the bank.

We met up on a Saturday afternoon around 2 pm. I arrived first and walked in, there was no one to greet me. I stood by the entrance wondering if I seated myself or if someone would acknowledge me. After a few minutes of standing there awkwardly, I was told to sit anywhere. 
I chose a table by the window. The restaurant was nice and bright and the decor is minimal, nothing fancy here. Mismatched tables and chairs and a tv that was playing a soccer match, weird. 
I was given the menu and water. 
There are plenty of delicious choices on the menu, so many that I had a hard time deciding what to get. 
I went with the cucumber salad to start out with and we ordered a pot of green tea. 
My salad was ok, I&#39;ve had better. 
I ordered the drunken mama noodles, and my friend ordered  the Dynamite fried rice with shrimp, a rice dish with onions, bell peppers, raisins and egg cooked in a spicy sriracha sauce. The food did not take long to come out. My dish looked amazing and smelled fabulous and I&#39;m happy to say that it did not disappoint. 
I ordered my noodles with the beef and there was plenty of beef, cabbage, basil, bamboo shoots, mama noodles, bell peppers, just yum!
The flavor was great and I liked that they respected my wishes and made my dish mild, I did not want it spicy. 
My friends rice looked delish as well but since she ordered extra spicy I was afraid to try it. We also ordered a dessert that my friend said was a must try. It was ginkgo nuts in a warm mousse. It looked weird and I would not have ordered it but it was good. We split desert but honestly, I could have eaten it all myself. 
Food was great but the service just ok. They took our order, delivered our food, brought our check and took payment. They kind of forgot about us. It would have been nice if they would have refilled our green tea or warmed it up. 
Overall, I would go back again. The portions were good, food was flavorful and they offer takeout. 
Will try then again soon and next time I won&#39;t forget to redeem my egg roll coupon."

We ordered takeout and the food was really good.  I recommend trying it.  I&#39;ll have to try something different next time to see how other meals taste.

You can&#39;t go wrong with the Pad Thai meal.  We also had the Tom Yum noodles (not the soup) which were good.  The crab Rangoon was good, and mango sticky rice for dessert was good."

4-stars seems logical since this is the only Thai food I have eaten since moving here, and don&#39;t have a good benchmark to measure against, other than Thai restaurants located out-of-area.

5-stars seems fitting because the owner/manager is very flexible with customizing dishes (more/less spicy, more/less veggies, vegan, etc.) and the vegetables are deliciously crisp-tender, and my Pad Thai was NOT swimming in sauce.

Upon entering the restaurant, things didn&#39;t start off on a good note. My husband and I waited several minutes before anyone acknowledged us. Finally, a lady did, yelling from the counter at the back of the dining room &#34;pick any table.&#34; The lady (not sure--manager or owner) was quite busy fulfilling multiple take-out orders.

After ten minutes, she came over, gave us menus and took our drink order. We ordered Pad Thai with vegetables, Fire Dish with chicken, Cucumber Salad, and Egg Rolls (complimentary with Yelp Check-In). 

The Egg Rolls (thin, narrow, crispy spring rolls -- quantity 4) and Cucumber Salad were served very quickly. I really like the Cucumber Salad--pretty presentation and perfect blend (for me) of sweet and sour dressing, light and refreshing. I will definitely order this salad again!

The Pad Thai with vegetables was great--lightly sauced with crisp-tender bean sprouts, carrot, green onion, cabbage, yellow onion, broccoli, and egg. This is the first time at any place where (1) the noodles were NOT drenched in sauce, and (2) the bean sprouts were crisp (not wilted).

The FIre Dish with chicken had medium chili heat and slight undertones of curry, with red and green peppers, carrot, string beans, and bamboo shoots. My husband really enjoyed it (I personally am not a fan of curry flavor).

Near the end of our meal, the owners (or managers) lady and man came over and took the time to chat with us.... how we liked our meal... how they take great care to customize orders to peoples&#39; own taste preferences... and what some of their popular dishes. They both are friendly and kind people, and are accommodating to their customers. I will definitely eat here again. It&#39;s a great neighborhood spot for lunch or dinner. The dining room is very roomy with good amount of space between tables. 

Just a keen observation... Chopsticks Noodle Cafe sets their tables with forks, not chopsticks--lol. Chopsticks are available upon request."

Mr SK and I had just gotten back from Thailand and were just craving that authentic delicious mouth watering fresh Thai food.  I am sooo thankful that I remembered this spot!! 

The owner is the sweetest, cutest man ever.  He once joked that his Thai food is even better than what you get in Thailand.  And I gotta say..... I think I would have to agree!!!

What I especially love about the menu is that they offer authentic Thai food from different regions of the country.  The Spicy Phuket Crab Pad Thai is better than all the pad thai I had in actual Phuket, Thailand.  Sweet coconut sticky rice: PERFECTION.  Thai style hot wings: LOVE.  All the curries are just delicious.

There was an Asian family sitting near the register, but we were seated near the window. I felt like it was a &#34;White Only&#34; section because as parties filed in after us there were groups of Indian Americans and Asian Americans seated near the register while we were on our own island...THE STRUGGLE IS REAL...hahaha.

Anyway, our waitress filled our waters while we looked through the menu. I knew I was getting Chicken Pad Thai with extra vegetables (NOT WORTH THE 1.00 to add extras....me thinks they forgot OR they just didn&#39;t care). My partner and I also split the Spicy Stir Fried Eggplant which was awesome! I ordered Tom Yum Mushroom and it was salty, but good. I asked for HOT with my dish but it came MEDIUM which sucked. Pat wanted to kick it up a notch!

Our waitress (who was not the owner, but the owner did come over and check after we were done) was no where to be found after we ordered. Kind of sad since I love water. 

Total for two soups, side dish of eggplant, two noodle dishes with extra veggies that weren&#39;t worth it? 50.22. I will go back and I hope the owner contacts me because she was very nice. The waitress was nice, but I think her shift ended so she disappeared!"

The owners here are legit and top notch professional and friendly people. I&#39;ve been here several times since my first online order as a Yelp preference suggested by my search. 

Damn. Crab Rangoon is stuffed with crab and cream cheese. Their mango dipping sauce I thought would be too sweet and I was again surprised when my lil takeout sauce container was cleaned out by my grubby hungry hands. 

Their Panang curry comes with lots of various vegetables and I ordered chicken with this. 1. All white chicken = mega BOMB in my mouth. 2. Their gravy or curry sauce is so delicious I want to drink it with my breakfast lunch and dinner. Everyday. 

Chicken sate is yummy, large skewers of chicken so you know they&#39;re serious about their app sizes, and I want their peanut sauce on my gf toast every morning. 


Ordered basil beef for my fella and holy crap did that smell (and he said tasted) incredible as well. 

Go here now. Go Often. 

And save it in your favorites. 

Or we won&#39;t be friends. 

Like, Ever.

I called in a take out order and said no mushrooms as I am extremely allergic to them. I got there to pick up my order, I talked to the owner who said he personally checked everything and there were no mushrooms. When I got home and laid everything out on a plate I counted no less than six mushrooms. These were not little slivers, which could also result in my death, they were very obvious. When I called to complain, I got the usual &#34;I&#39;m sorry, they must have gotten past me. I will give you a 10% discount next time. So sorry&#34; Not sure why Asian restaurants are not capable of dealing with allergies but this is the second one in a month that has failed and lost a customer"

I hadn&#39;t had Thai food in a very long time, so I was looking forward to it. We decided before we even arrived at the restaurant that we would be getting soup to start off.

I ordered the Tom Yum Chicken, and my brother decided on the Tom Yum Mushroom. It came out very quickly and both soups were nicely garnished with cilantro and tomatoes. I&#39;ll admit, I was a bit confused that they even had Tom Yum Mushroom soup; I thought mushrooms were standard in Tom Yum anyways. Oh well!

For our entrees, we both ordered Pad Thai. We both had the Chicken Pad Thai. I ordered mine mild, he ordered his spicy. We also decided to split a veggie entrée; spicy basil Asian eggplant was the choice.

Before we could finish our soups (good but not great; nothing special to note), our food arrived! They made my brother&#39;s dish medium instead of spicy, but mine was correct. He ended up adding hot sauce anyways so it didn&#39;t matter. The spicy eggplant had some kick but wasn&#39;t overly spicy (I&#39;m a wimp).

The Pad Thai was okay. It had your typical toppings, including carrots, cabbage, and peanuts. I was disappointed that peanut sauce was an extra charge. 

The noodle dishes weren&#39;t overly sweet, but they definitely left me wanting more. Overall, I wasn&#39;t that impressed with Chopsticks. I&#39;m on the fence on whether I&#39;ll be back. The service wasn&#39;t terrible, but it definitely wasn&#39;t good. Our server switched about 4 times in an hour.

I will note that it became quite busy as we left. There were 2 parties when we arrived, but 7 or 8 when we left."

It was about half-hour before they closed and my order arrived in a timely manner. Unfortunately the food was terrible. My chicken Pad Thai was flavorless, the egg rolls tastes like cardboard and all of it was cold.  I warmed it up and it was still bad. That was $50 worth of food straight into the trash.

I chose Chopsticks because of the high Yelp reviews and also the free order of egg rolls that you get if you check in on your smartphone (hint hint!). 

The location of the restaurant is great - in a big strip mall right off of Rte. 59, but luckily just far enough south of the mall and the construction area to avoid all of the chaotic nightmare that getting too close to that entails. We dined in at about 2:30 on a Saturday and the restaurant actually had quite a few other diners in it, which to me is a great sign for such a tiny restaurant on off peak hours.

The host/waiter was delightful. He was very friendly and attentive, even though he was the only one serving the room. Our drinks never went low, and I had a special order that he saw to with no complaints, evening offering me extra on the side just in case I needed more. We ordered the Pad Thai and the Pineapple Fried Rice, with egg rolls. Everything was quite good, and my husband felt that his Pad Thai was better than others in the area that he has tried. My rice had a bit fewer pineapples in it than I would have liked, but I would order again. The egg rolls are the little ones (more like spring rolls) but very tasty. The prices are reasonable for the portions that you get - we both ended up with leftovers that will probably produce a whole extra meal, and our bill with tip was about $30. We enjoyed our experience and would recommend a stop if you&#39;re looking for some yummy Thai in the mall area!"

Anyways I tried the orange chicken and fried rice. I thought it was ok. Next time I&#39;m going to try a noodle dish as they look better than the orange chicken that I had.

He claimed that the kitchen is closed, they close at 8PM, but it was 7?. I asked if he was serious and how that makes any sense. Then he responded that the chef was overwhelmed and it will take too long to make our food. We were only two people. I took a look inside, it&#39;s an open layout, and there was like 7-10 ppl and majority was one big group, and 85% of the restaurant was empty????

As we walked out his family arrived, wife and baby daughter, and they unstrapped the baby put her in the stroller and all that jazz, took like a five mins, to only walk inside with his family and get kicked out too!!

Needless to say, that being my very first experience. I was not happy and they will not be earning any of my friends or family business again!!!"

I had the pad Thai with crispy noodles. My husband had basil fried rice with shrimp &amp; my kids shared the teriyaki chicken. Everything was devoured. My kids wanted more chicken, I didn&#39;t anticipate them liking it so much."

The feel of the place is that of fast food Thai, however, the prices match an upscale restaurant, which is part of the reason why this isn&#39;t a 5 star.

I ordered Pad See Ewe with beef, but it arrived with chicken. A minor mistake and I could&#39;ve sent it back but I was hungry and not that upset about it, so I ate it.  It was pretty bland...not nearly enough sauce/flavor. Made me miss my go-to in the city for this dish (Hot Woks Cool Sushi). My husband&#39;s noodle dish was a lot better, had a nice kick and plenty of veggies, but I don&#39;t recall the name. His arrived with beef as intended. Prices were a little higher than I&#39;m used to as well.  I think my dish came to $11 with chicken, would have been $12 with beef and I usually pay no more than $9 or $10 for the same thing in the city, so not sure how they justify that.  I may give this place another try in the future with the hopes of improving their rating."

I thought I was going to have to give up my love or either drive to Schaumburg or Chicago on a weekly basis to feed my need. 

Then one bright sunny day I came upon this place on yelp and thought there might be a glimmer of hope. I was greeted by a very nice gentleman who took my order. I had the basil fried rice w/ ground chicken and pad thai w/ chicken. Both were super delish and definitely warranted more visits. Now when I visit, that nice gentleman remembers me and greets me with a smile.

So I found this place on the net and read the Yelp reviews and was sold.  What a mistake that was!!  The shrimp &#34;roll&#34; appetizer was a piece of shrimp wrapped in noodles then deep fried, it was bland bland bland, crumbly and a waste of shrimp.  The Basil Chicken was just so so and full of a lot of vegetable &#34;filler&#34; to stretch it.  The worst dish was the Basil Noodles that I ordered with beef... the beef was shoe leather, flat pieces of beef cut on the grain, and the noodles were barely present.  The menu is pictorially beautiful and very seductive, the reviews from the &#34;Thai&#34; experts were convincing...but bad food is just bad food.

I called the next day to complain because I never at the Basil Noodles with beef and was going to return it.  The &#34;owner&#34; wasn&#39;t in to chime in her opinion and they asked me to call back.  I don&#39;t have time for that, so I 86&#39;d the Basil Noodles and resolved to stay away from them.

I ordered the pineapple &amp; cashew fried rice which was very good. Nice mix of peppers, onion, raisins &amp; egg. Boyfriend had the spicy Tom yum fried rice &amp; was very happy with his flavorful meal.

Not that it&#39;s not good, it&#39;s just one of those places that wasn&#39;t great. Therefore, I&#39;m borderlining between 3 to 4 stars. Yelp doesn&#39;t have a .5 point system to please read my review with this in mind. Total score: 3.5 stars. 

Service-wise and attention from the staff: very good! I would say 4.5 stars on this one. Our waitress came back often to check on us and refill our water so many times. I was thirsty that night and drank about 4 glasses of water! Don&#39;t worry, we made sure at the end of the night to give her a generous tip. On top of that the manager lady (I think, unless she is just a very, very, very friendly passerby) kept coming over to our table, maybe 3 times total to ask if we are doing alright. She also asked the tables next to us too, so I know that it wasn&#39;t because she recognized our famous* faces as Yelp Elites (hah!)

Food-wise is where I have to take it down a notch and give 3.5 to 4 stars. As I said, I think I do need to come back here another time, try some other dishes and write an update to see how I feel. Maybe it&#39;s because Thai food is one of my favorite foods so I&#39;m a bit more of critic here. To be honest, it&#39;s really hard for most Thai place to get a perfect score from me. I think this place comes close to being &#34;I&#39;m a fan&#34; but isn&#39;t quite there as far as their dishes (which is where the weight of my score is.) 

I had gotten the Thai Basil Fried Rice with Chicken. My 2 other girlfriends got the Pad Thai and Pad See Ewe, all popular dishes. We also got appetizer of egg rolls (called spring roll for some reason). Nothing stood out as being too special with the appetizers. Overall, with the entrees, they were all... kind of quite bland., like &#39;meh if you know what I mean. Especially if you&#39;re a fan of the noodle dishes, I think you will be disappointed. They really could have used a bit more salt and sugar. Oh, but  maybe this is good and healthy so who am I to say? Or you could go home and re-cook the dishes to your liking. Haha.

Anyways, I had enough leftovers of my fried rice to feed me for 2 more lunch days at work. Though, when I took it home, I realized that I didn&#39;t really see much chicken in my chicken fried rice at all! It was mostly rice. *pouts*

So while I think their protein are a bit skimpy here, their portions are big and their ingredients are fresh! I wouldn&#39;t discourage you from trying this place, it&#39;s not bad! It&#39;s just not quite the authentic Thai I was looking for to satisfy my cravings. I would come back for another round later and maybe it can get me to change my mind."

I ended up making my order online which was even more convenient than having to call it in, getting the Tom Yum Soup w/ shrimp and the Panang Noodles w/ chicken. The place was empty when I picked up which was weird because it was lunch hours but the man working was very friendly and welcoming. 

Honestly, getting home &amp; opening up the bags, neither dish looked appetizing, but both ended up having delicious flavors with just the right amount of spiciness. Only thing that bothered me was that the extra dollar i paid for shrimp in the soup only allotted me 3 pieces. Other than that, I&#39;m definitely looking forward to trying other things on the menu in the near future!"

We got their lunch specials with crab rangoon: the portions were decent and the food delicious.

My only quip is if the tom yum soup could be an option for the lunch special at an additional $2/$3. The vegetable broth that came with the special was all right but I&#39;m sure many diners would appreciate having the opportunity to try a more authentic Thai soup. Same goes for the soft drink deal; I wouldn&#39;t mind paying more to get Thai iced tea and Thai iced coffee. Just some suggestions for this comfy, family joint.

The crab rangoons were good, and the pineapple sauce was a perfect complement.  The mango smoothie was definitely made with real fruit, but it wasn&#39;t very sweet at all.  They also do not have tapioca in their smoothies, even though the picture clearly showed little black floating balls in the smoothies.

The drunken noodles were disappointing.  The noodles, bean sprouts and basil were the standout ingredients in this dish.  But there wasn&#39;t any spice or heat at all.  That&#39;s odd, considering the little red pepper next to the dish on the menu indicating it was spicy.  It was okay, but it didn&#39;t meet my expectations.  For $10, I got a dish that I could&#39;ve made better at home.

On a Saturday night, they were somewhat busy, but there was no wait for a table.  When I walked in, I noticed a whiteboard with several specials scribbled down.  Pumpkin curry something?  Too bad the specials weren&#39;t on a printed sheet of paper, because I totally forgot about them once seated.  Our waiter was pleasant also. 

This is bare bones decor, and I like the casual/dive-y vibe here.  It&#39;s a small space, with tile floors, about 12-15 tables and a mirror along an entire wall.  There was music playing, I recall hearing a Rhianna and Maroon 5 song.  Yup, there&#39;s some Top 40 pop radio pumpin&#39; in there.  I have to hear this junk in my car every morning, and the mood of this place is a little more college coffeehouse station anyway.

For $36 (pre-tip included:  appetizer, smoothie, 2 entrees), I feel like it should&#39;ve been about $10 less.

I might go back, but I&#39;ll remember to put a major emphasis on &#34;MAKE IT SPICY!&#34;  Meanwhile I&#39;ll keep my eyes open for a better Thai restaurant in my area."

All their food is fantastic...I really wish the buffet they used to have on Sunday mornings was still there, when you could try EVERYTHING! I have fond memories of their chicken fried rice, it was different than getting from a carry-out Chinese place. However, I have not ordered this in awhile, because I&#39;m pretty stuck on their pad thai or yellow curry.

THAI ICED TEA OMG. You get such a huge glass of this and it is liquid dessert. You NEED to get this.

All in all, I love this small, quaint place. It&#39;s been open for awhile, but under different names and owners over the years. I definitely preferred it as Thai Lotus, when it had cuter decor and Chad was the owner. Chad is still there, talking to all the patrons and serving you your meals with a smile. He&#39;s a really interesting fella, he loves to travel and can tell you so much about Thailand. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s the owner now, but I&#39;m still glad he is there.

The environment was great, a little on the noisy side, but not too bad. We all had a great time as our company ordered us food and allowed us to order drinks.

I had the strawberry mojito and it was delicious! So refreshing and I couldn&#39;t even taste the liquor in it. I drank 2 fairly quick and was afraid to get more because it was going down like water.

As far as appetizers, we had the lettuce wrap which consisted of chicken &amp; shrimp, it came with garnishing of cucumber slices marinated in some picked sauce, kind of like bahn mi tasting and then this spicy sauce. The sauce was good, just a little on the salty side, I suggest to just not put so much. 

We also had sushi, (california, crab, and shrimp) all were good. They also ordered us calamari, which I thought was more on the too overcooked side as it was kinda rubbery tasting. Avacado eggrolls, which were very good, especially with the sauce it comes with, we also had hamburger sliders, which did not look like sliders but a regular hamburger because they were so huge! Then last, but not least, we had am order or brownies. I thought was just okay and a little on the dry side. I usually like my brownies more moist than that.

Overall, I would definitely come back. I liked the atmosphere and it would call for a great date night or just a gathering with friends. The servers were great and attentive to our big group, so that&#39;s a big plus for me."

Another note, I love spicy and sushi. My mother, does not. She ordered macadamia nut chicken, which she said was too spiced and so was the sautéed spinach. People who cannot tolerate any garlic, red pepper type spice, just order it plain. 

Their macadamia nut chicken is THE BOMB! So, I cannot complain!"

We ordered:

+ Avocado Egg Rolls 
(pretty good flavor, but the delish sauce makes it - 4/5)

- Spicy Tuna roll  (good, but mostly rice - 3.5/5)
- Crab Crunch roll (meh. 2.5/5)
- Dragon roll (A-OK - 3/5)
+ Atlantic roll (good - 4/5)
- Rainbow roll (A-OK - 3.5/5)


Overall verdict:
Just &#34;okay.&#34; The rolls were very rice-heavy, some were rolled narrow at the ends (= little filling at those parts), and were just bland. Thank goodness for wasabi and soy sauce! The most flavorful were the Spicy Tuna and the Atlantic.

The price point is obviously the biggest highlight: we paid $35 pre-tip.

Service was generally inattentive. When our server DID return, she didn&#39;t ask whether we wanted anything else, so we ended up having to flag her a few times. Waters were refilled.

I had been super excited to finally get to Kona Grill, but I can&#39;t help but feel the experience was lackluster. I guess next time (if there IS a &#34;next time&#34;) I&#39;ll forgo the sushi and opt for the flatbread."

If you&#39;re looking for quality sushi definitely don&#39;t come here for that.  We shared the caterpillar roll, picasso roll, voodoo roll, and miso-sak sea bass.  The caterpillar roll was your standard eel roll and I had no complaints whereas the other two rolls were unbelievably spicy and I thought I was going to die.  Ok, I&#39;m being dramatic but my mouth was on fire and it was not fun at all!  

The best part of the dinner was the sea bass which was tender and cooked well and served with shrimp and pork fried rice and pan-asian ratatouille.  I think they used the same sauce for the sea bass, fried rice, and ratatouille.  The sauce itself was a bit too sweet but good nonetheless however the dish could have used a little more depth since everything tasted the same. I hear the happy hour at Kona is decent so if I were to return, it would be to check that out."

I knew Kona Grill had a hh special from living in Dallas and wanted to try it out.  The hh menu has quite a bit of food on it, ranging from simpler rolls for about $3.50 to &#34;fancier&#34; rolls for about $8.50 and smaller apps like calamari and spinach dip for about $6.50. 

4 stars for the service and the variety but for me, the sushi was just sloppy with lots of rice.  Not bad if you want something filling but the rice ratio was just way too much for me. And while you can get away with a fairly cheap food bill, the drinks weren&#39;t necessarily cheap or priced that much differently typical prices, each cocktail ranging around the $7 mark.  So the price can still add up."

The Happy Hour menu is one of the largest I&#39;ve seen.We ordered one of the crab rolls, BBQ chicken flat bread, Sliders, Calamari, about 5 margaritas and brownie (which was huge). Our bill came out to 63 dollars.... Not bad at all in my book!"

I always think its neat when a restaurant has an aquarium. The dining area was spacious which makes eating very comfortable. The color scheme was also pretty inviting reminding me of being by the sea. 

Even though I know Kona Grill does sushi (which I love) sometimes you just want a simple sandwich. I ordered the caprese chicken sandwich. It was light and simple, yet very flavorful. I love caprese salads and those flavors go very well with chicken. I also liked the bread they used. It was hearty which held up well with the sauce. Next time, I will have to go to the sushi bar to try the sushi and see if it is any good."

Apparently HH must be the main attraction of this restaurant because all the tables outside were full of people whom were also ordering HH. This restaurant has a great HH for drinks and small light bites. 
We over ordered by an insane amount because we were too hungry, and ended up with alot of food leftover. 

We had the chicken kebobs, which was plated on top of the most delicious crunchy cheesey salad !! I loved the salad on the kebobs, a bbq chicken flatbread which had a lot of cheese and chicken, a spicy shrimp, and a spicy tuna roll, fondue which was just ok .  I didn&#39;t really enjoy the fondue because it only came with pretzel bites and granny smith apples. The calamari was great as well, it was a very large portion for the price. 

The total came out to $33 which was ridiculous because we ordered 6 dishes total.  The food was all tasty and came out pretty quickly. I would definitely come here again for HH and perhaps for dinner as well. I do want to try their butter cake !!"

We showed up just after 9, ordered two happy hour items (wave roll and Kona calamari) and a pasta dish off the regular menu. Ordered around 9:13PM, along with a coffee and a Sprite with lemon. After the first fifteen minutes of waiting, we were served the drinks. The Sprite i got was awfully watered down, but since our waitress only showed up to give us the drinks and disappeared again, I had no choice but to sip it slowly and hope she would reappear. She came to refill his coffee 10 minutes later, so I took advantage of the rare sighting to ask for another Sprite, telling her mine was watered down. She brought the same exact thing the next time, so I just gave up and asked a busboy for water. 

The food finally arrived at 9:56PM, we could tell it had been sitting out for quite a while. The dipping sauce for the calamari (which is supposed to be a thick orange spicy mayo) had somehow melted or something and looked like orange vinegar. The calamari itself was more breading than actual calamari, completely void of any flavor. My wave roll dish (5 pieces) was tolerable, except for my last piece which wasn&#39;t rolled correctly and had fallen apart. I took a bite and I found that there was a big shrimp tail in the shrimp tempura part of the roll, so that pretty much ruined that dish for me. 

My boyfriends pasta was bad, dry and probably microwaved too long. 

I came in because I had a birthday coupon but even with the $15 discount I was still displeased. I had decided to give them another chance after overcharging our drinks last time we were there, but the quality of the food and the service have gone so downhill lately that I would rather eat the fish filet sandwich at a McDonalds drive thru than go back here (that sandwich is *amazing* when compared to this horrid place). 

I&#39;ll leave the pics of them overcharging us last time so you guys can know what to watch out for. They overcharged us $2.75 extra for the Makers Mark Old Fashioneds, and $2 extra for my Moscow Mule (both on the happy hour drink menu at the time). DOUBLE CHECK YOUR BILL!"

Their margaritas on special are really good too and they&#39;re only like $6. Our entire bill for two people with 4 dishes and 4 drinks came to around $40. The happy hour is only for the bar/patio area so spots fill up very quickly. The service can be a bit hit or miss I will admit. Our server tonight was not as attentive as he could have been. I requested sugar instead of salt on the rim of my glass, I received salt. We had to request water and chop sticks a couple of times. He also did not come back to check on us after the food and drinks were delivered, but then there were times our server was on top of things from beginning to end. I guess it all depends on the day. All in all, this happy hour is one that will keep you coming back just because the price is so right."

I would have fallen over laughing.  No laughing now!  I just had some killer sashimi at Kona Grill in Oak Brook.  Sashimi is sushi without a net.  You are on a tightrope.  The fish has to be absolutely fresh, or it&#39;s a total disaster.  This fish was fresh.  I got an off-menu sashimi selection, and it was great.  Perfectly cut fish on a shiso leaf on a bed of daikon threads.  Good soy, and killer wasabi.  (and if you mix your wasabi into the soy and make a green paste I will come over and poke you with a very sharp instrument!  No No No!!).  Just a dibble of wasabi on the fish, and lightly drag it thru the soy.  Pefection.  A nice chilled sake on the side.

We had a dragon roll, spicy tuna roll, California roll, pot stickers, and fried calamari. They don&#39;t have my favorite,  the Godzilla roll but I made due with the Dragon roll. The calamari was tasty but nothing to write home about. The California roll, ummm...I don&#39;t even remember what it tasted like so I won&#39;t judge. 

Drinks: White Sangria was a hit for me. I had 3, should have made it 4. 

Service: Our waiter was somewhat accommodating, a nice young man.

Service - 5 stars 
Our waitress was a rockstar. She was personable, funny, attentive and knowledgeable. I wish all servers were more like her. 


Albacore Tataki - 4 stars 
This is my favorite item at KG. It was good but it has better at other locations. 

Bulgogi Tacos - 4 stars 
Very good. Flavorful, filling and unique. 

Miso-Sake Sea Bass - 4 stars 
It tastes very different than typical sea bass. Loved the creation.  It is a large portion. If you are having sushi or sashimi, you would be better served sharing this or ordering it with a plan to take some home. 

Rainbow rolls - 4 stars 
Fresh and delicious. 

Spinach Dip - 4 stars 
Pretty typical but good. 


Edamame - 4 stars 
Loved the traditional style edamame. The angry edamame sauce is terrible. I like spicy food but this was simply gross."

Lobster Mac and cheese for me. Chicken pad Thai for my wife.  Calamari for the app was very good.
I got a happy hour margarita and paid extra to upgrade to Patron.  Only problem was I got the drink and could not taste any tequila whatsoever.
That is on the bartender or manager though for the stingy pour.

Nice selection of sushi and apps (avocado eggs rolls are my favorite) and all for $5-$6. The drinks are also strong and delicious, what more can I ask for? You do have to sit at the bar though, which is a HUGE bummer if you&#39;re going in with a group of 4 or more because not everyone will be able to talk to one another easily.

During dinner, there is an extensive menu that you can order from- something to satisfy everyone. All of the entrees are around $20, sandwiches are around $13, and entree portions are huge. I&#39;ve never gotten steak before, but I see large parties get them all the time. Actually, every time I&#39;ve been to Kona it has always been filled and busy, and entertaining one large party of 12+.

There is not a huge beer selection here, but still enough options to choose from.  They do have a larger wine &amp; cocktail list - and wine is 1/2 off bottles on Wednesday!

I have also sat in the dining room for dinner and ordered delicious entrees.  I chose to come here for my birthday with family as well.  While its not the best restaurant I&#39;ve ever been to, I think it&#39;s just a great people-pleaser with lots of tasty options.

I came to Kona Grill for the happy hour specials (4-7pm), and that would be the only reason I might come back, but I would never come and pay regular price for the food here. 

We ordered a few sushi rolls off the happy hour menu, and you can tell right by looking at them that they were not made fresh. Each piece I tried to pick up was stuck to the other pieces, which is from the roll sitting in a fridge and packed together for a while. They tasted bland too. The avocado egg rolls were pretty tasty, but again, not fresh. It tasted like they were left under the heat lamp for too long. Someone could argue that I shouldn&#39;t expect amazing food if I order from a happy hour menu, but this was just plain disappointing. 

The cocktails I ordered were good! The restaurant decor and atmosphere is very nice. Good after work spot. The hostesses were very nice, our waiter was not in the best mood I could tell but still nice enough. I see that other people commented on the iron seats!

We started with gin on the rocks with blue cheese olives and the happy hour Cabernet. The wine was delicious! I meant to ask what brand it was and forgot.  Wine on &#34;special&#34; is often a departure from good quality. We wanted to cheers to great news, and I didn&#39;t feel like drinking otherwise, so the happy hour wine was an easy choice. I was so pleasantly surprised by how tasty it was.

The shrimp appetizer got rave reviews. I vacuumed the blue cheese crumbles strewn around the plate, and they were great -- packed with flavor and melt-in-your-mouth good.

Since I&#39;ve heard so much about the sushi here, I had my eyes on sushi, only. I got the Spicy Tuna roll, and it was okay. The showstopper was the Jambalaya, which I struggled not to eat all of from my fellow diner&#39;s plate. It was spiced to perfection -- an explosion of heaven in your mouth. Yum!

Our waiter/bartender was from Colorado, so we got to bond over the beauty of the mountains and ridiculous weather that makes it 70F while we&#39;re freezing our butts off 5,000ft lower, haha.

All in all, a nice experience. It&#39;s very loud in there, so be prepared to yell a bit or mime your way through the meal. Next time, I&#39;ll get something else. The sushi left a lot to be desired when compared to the incredible Jambalaya - and I&#39;m a very easy-to-please sushi eater."

So I went back again last Sunday and it was a little better because I sat at the bar. My food came faster and my waiter was on point more than last time. So I will change my rating to a 4."

Date of Visit: 1/13/15

Kona Grill was close to my hotel during business travel, and admittedly convenience was the deciding factor to avoid the frigid, bitter cold that was Chicago in January. Overall the restaurant has a very fun vibe, with trendy decor and a solid bar area with TVs and the like. I sat at the bar and ordered from the sushi menu while chatting up the bartenders, which were all very personable and attentive. 

I ordered the Coconut Shrimp (toasted macadamia nuts, mango, cucumber, cream cheese, rose nectar, soy paper) and Spider (fried soft shell crab, crab mix, avocado, cucumber, nori &amp; soy paper, eel sauce) rolls, both of which had far too much going on to really taste the product.

While I wouldn&#39;t dissuade anyone from Kona Grill, I would point out that this is a much more &#34;Americanized&#34; (lots of ingredients, so-so quality) version of sushi than some people, including myself, are drawn to."

Food was a solid B.... maybe a B+. Salmon was good but sauce was maybe a bit too sweet for me. Would have liked it crisper on outside. Corn and mushroom vegetable was kind of goopy but tasty. Burger was terrific but spicy. Shredded Napa cabbage salad was excellent.Kids menu very nice and served in a Bento box with an orange carved into a sweet kitten figure. Desserts were meh. Service....,well our server was friendly &amp; pleasant but perhaps too busy. Forgot our salads and soup. When we asked for them she asked did we really still want them.

The food has been excellent every time.

For those who like sushi, they had a large sushi menu but for those who don&#39;t like sushi, there are many other options on their menu.

Service left a little to be desired on our third visit (I had to ask for my water glass to be refilled) but overall, service has been acceptable.

I plan on going again."

Nothing fancy, casual environment. A bit darker to which is nice for a date... Sushi is eh. I have had better. Drinks are great tho! Try the Kentucky Mile, Effen Cucumber (low cal) and GinSin Sling ( or something ) for starters.

We started with the Smoked Gouda Fondue... It was an ok fondue. The flavor was on based on the cheese used, but the consistency was a little off.

The boy went for the Lobster Mac &#39;n Cheese... He was pleased with the large chunks of lobster; there just didn&#39;t seem to be that much of it. It was quite tasty though.
 
I opted for the Philadelphia Roll &amp; the Eel Roll... This wasn&#39;t the highest quality sushi that I&#39;ve had. That said, for the price, I would have expected a little more quality. 

Our server was great! She checked in on us and kept our drinks filled with a smile!"

They get two stars instead of one for two reasons:
1. Great outdoor space
2. House salad was good 

Here&#39;s what we ate:
House salad - high quality greens that tasted good 
Tuna sushi roll - bad quality tuna and rice
Yellowtail spicy roll - not spicy, and poor quality fish

Coworkers:
Thai - said noodles were undercooked and there was shells in her food, gross!

Sashimi- grocery store quality, it looked gross and he said it tasted gross.

The service was okay and the price was high and the environment was great.  There are much better restaurants in the area and we will go to those next time."

I needed some peace &amp; quiet, so I headed down Butterfield and found Kona Grill.  The parking lot was deceptive of how busy the restaurant was.  There were several open tables, and I was able to get in and out of here within an hour - including the time it took to eat my FREE dessert.

Service was fantastic.  I was a little suspicious that the great service was due to the survey they ask you to fill out at the end of your meal, but who knows?  Maybe my server really was just fantastic.  She took the time to explain the specials, took my order and got the food delivered quickly, and at the end of the meal asked me to fill out the survey - I filled it out on my phone and got a free dessert on the spot.  

For lunch I had a Spicy Tuna roll and the Coconut Shrimp roll.  Both were amazing and fresh.  The Coconut Shrimp had macadamia nuts inside, making it extra crunchy.  The ingredients in the roll were a little bit uneven, as the first and last piece didn&#39;t have much in them.  But the flavor and freshness alone is enough to make me want to go back for more sushi.

I chose the Passion Fruit Creme Brulee as my dessert and inhaled it.  I didn&#39;t taste much passion fruit flavor, but I love creme brulee, and this one was perfectly bruleed.  Is that a verb?  It is now.

It is pricey for sushi though.  For my 2 rolls and a glass of water, I spent $19 before tip.  Kona has some damn good sushi, but not if you&#39;re in an all-you-can-eat mood.  Kona is quality, not quantity."

The place got packed around 6 and it was standing room only. I will echo other reviews that the high top tables are small and uncomfortable. There&#39;s no way more than two people can eat and drink at the table, and even that is pushing it.

We got a few things off the happy hour menu. Their happy hour menu is pretty extensive and I love that it spans from 3-7 daily. We got the Gouda fondue ($6) which was a ton of food. Tons of pretzel bites and at least a full apple. The Gouda wasn&#39;t as smooth as traditional fondue but had great flavor. We also got the avocado egg rolls ($5) and these were amazing. The honey cilantro dipping sauce was a perfect compliment to the avocado. The last thing we got was the marguerita flatbread ($6) which I was very hesitant about but this was the best flatbread of this kind. The balsamic reduction was the best part and took this flatbread to the next level. 

I&#39;ll definitely be back for happy hour again soon!"

We ordered a few things off the happy hour menu and had cocktails. I&#39;m not quite sure how they did it but the food came out so fast it was faster than going through a drive thru. We weren&#39;t really sure who was taking care of us since there were so many people behind the bar. I wish they would be a little more personable. They weren&#39;t rude or anything but I felt we were just left alone a bit too much. But I must say their salted caramel creme brûlée was so good! And it was huge! Probably one of the best desserts I&#39;ve had recently! I think it was on a seasonal menu but I hope they decide to keep it permanently!

The menu, when I perused it online, looked super yummy. The price once I got in the restaurant scared me a bit (there are no prices on the online menu) but I went for it. We were with a big group, and there were a few people at the table unhappy with their meals. Wrong dishes, just generally not yummy. The service was also quite slow. Drinks went empty often. A generally poor experience.

But the scariest part? Afterwards, I actually Googled the nutrition facts for this place. Ok, I&#39;m not expecting a healthy meal, but even just the chicken satay appetizer has 1,500 calories! It is just chicken on a stick! And the ultimate chocolate brownie has as much sugar as TEN Snickers Bars. That is kind of horrifying."

   I love you so much, Kona Grill!!! After coming here a bagillion times over many years, I feel confident in saying that this is the best Happy Hour in the Chicagoland area hands down. 
    The deals for the food are great, especially for the sushi rolls (try the Bama roll). There&#39;s also options for eating sliders, flatbreads, avocado egg rolls, potstickers, and pig wings. Everything is Always delicious (and I believe I&#39;ve tried everything on the happy hour menu). 
     It wouldn&#39;t be happy hour without the drinks: the prices are more than reasonable for the beer, martinis, and margaritas. For the price, the flavor and alcohol is definitely there. 
    The bar and covered patio are nice areas to sit (the only area to sit for happy hour). If it&#39;s cold, just sit by the fireplace or under one of their monstrous heat lamps. In the summer the huge windows open up. Service is great 98-99% of the time. You usually get served quick, even when it&#39;s busy. Check the website for the hours of happy hour. I believe it goes all day on Sunday! Definitely try it out! You might see me there."

We sat in a corner at a hightop table for four. I honestly can&#39;t see how four people could have eaten at that table. The water glasses, another drink glass and an appetizer plate for each person would have been too much on the table. Thankfully, there were just two of us, so we were okay. I may as well get my other critique out there now and be done with it...the chairs at the hightop tables weren&#39;t very deep. And they were slippery. My husband commented on that a couple times. 

Our server was also the bartender. Normally I&#39;m not a huge fan of this, but Frank did a great job and as it got a little busier, others stepped in to keep the service up to par. He made some great suggestions and didn&#39;t seem bothered that we weren&#39;t drinking cocktails and just wanted to focus on the Happy Hour Eats instead. 

And so eat we did. Too much for two people. But, there is half a wedge of carrot cake leftover in the fridge still, so we couldn&#39;t have been that bad!

We started with two maki rolls - a California and a Philly roll. Both were very good!  Plus each roll was eight pieces and at half price, this was a great deal!!  We moved on to chicken potstickers with dipping sauce. These were different and on the list to repeat next time. The filling had veggies you could see and taste. There was plenty of chicken and the dipping sauce pulled it all together. Five potstickers showed up on the plate with a little Asian type slaw. Then we tried the cheeseburger sliders. Except the plate of two with French fries had one exactly as intended by the chef while the second one (mine) was stripped of its cheese and garnish upon request. The beef was seasoned and served on a buttered/grilled bun that was light and fluffy. The fries were hot and salted. My husband had a spicy tuna roll. We would skip this one next time. Yes there were right pieces again, but this tuna wasn&#39;t his favorite. What did rank high on the list was the giant wedge of carrot cake served with pecans and a warm (salted, I think) caramel sauce.  The frosting was different. In a good way. Wish I could describe it better, but I won&#39;t do it justice. So just go get a piece. And share it. Or plan to take it home for a midnight snack. 

Bottom line, this is a great spot to satisfy anyone&#39;s craving. Great for couples, double dates or large groups. I could even see sitting here on your own if you wanted to grab some really good nibbles and were in the area. Enjoy!!"

I really enjoy sushi, but I am allergic to fish. I love shellfish, and have found several options available at Kona. A fish allergy can be very problematic in most sushi restaurants due to unlisted ingredients or cross contamination issues; however at Kona they not only use clean utensils but they notify me if any potential cross contamination sources, such as oil used to fry fish, and a manager separately delivers my entree so there is no possibility of contamination in route from the kitchen. Because of the care they take with my allergies I can enjoy dinner and try new sushi."

As an Oakbrook Local we tend to come here often for sushi and drinks. The windows in the bar area open up and work nicely for a sheltered outdoor feel on a nice summer day. ALL DAY HAPPY HOUR ON SUNDAYS!

Service is always wonderful. The drinks are tasty and nicely presented. 

FOOD is outstanding. I recommend the Mediterranean flat bread which was made with a perfect crispy bread and a cheese lovers dream on top. 

I would have rated this place a 4-5 star but the sushi is admirable but not the greatest I&#39;ve ever had. Tried many rolls on the menu but have yet to say it was mouth watering. 
The bama roll was recommended as there &#34;spicy&#34; roll but seemed a bit skim on the ingredients and was far from spicy. The chicken shrimp lettuce wrap is  tasty and low calorie which makes for a fairly healthy meal... a little siracha and you&#39;re good to go.

Overall...I will definitely be back but mostly because the flat breads are outstanding and HAPPY HOUR but not exactly the sushi."

Being part of the birthday club, I received a $15 gift certificate e-mailed to me and decided to use it for lunch today. 

Now, Kona Grill has been my go-to restaurant for group outings for a long while now. Birthdays, celebrations and just regular get-together for a drink outings have all happened here. I&#39;ve even brought my dad here, and he loves it too. 

That said, I stopped in today and picked out 3 sushi rolls to have as my lunch. I sat at the bar because I didn&#39;t want to take up an entire table by myself.

The bartender was friendly and helpful as could be. He took my order and brought me my drink almost immediately. 

For the sushi, I tried my usual repertoire of the crab crunch and spicy tuna, but since I had the certificate I did a soft shell crab too. AMAZING!

All of Kona&#39;s sushi is made right when you order it, nothing ever tastes un-fresh. 

So the bartender wished me a happy birthday (it&#39;s not for a couple weeks, but he didn&#39;t know that) and I paid the balance of my check. 

Then he brought out a humungous red velvet cupcake adorned with fresh kiwi and strawberry slices, with a little candle in it. That was so extra special nice. I really appreciate it. I know most places empower their servers to give away desserts and whatnot, but this was totally unexpected. The cake was moist and the frosting was so smooth and creamy.

I may cheat on Kona once in awhile to try out other places, but I always end up coming back. Kona never lets me down!

They sent me a $15 birthday certificate, which I thought was generous--the caveats are that it&#39;s dine-in only and not valid with Happy Hour prices. I came in by myself and sat on the patio and was greeted by an extremely friendly server. I let her know right away about the coupon, just in case, but she didn&#39;t hassle me at all. I ordered the Las Vegas roll and the cucumber salad with ahi tuna. I was also between the fiery shrimp and the spicy yellowtail and I asked for her opinion. She recommended the yellowtail. I was extremely happy with all 3 of my choices because each was better than the rest. The yellowtail was a basic maki roll, but packed a mean punch of flavor. The Vegas is my new favorite roll. The cucumber salad was really good, although with my other two rolls I probably could have skipped the ahi tuna. I couldn&#39;t finish the salad, but I did finish my two rolls. My total was about $10 after the coupon, which I thought was a great deal for how fantastic my sushi tasted. 

As I&#39;ve mentioned in my other reviews, don&#39;t miss the Happy Hour. It&#39;s such a great deal and allows you to try a lot of sushi!"

I don&#39;t like sushi so I knew I was going to order from their regular menu. We made reservations for a Saturday night (just in case) and good thing we did because it was pretty crowded during late dinner time.
There was a bar, main seating area, and another bar near the sushi. I was surprise to see so many kids there (they were all well behaved though). Since this place has a date night or drinks with friends ambiance to it...but in reality it can also be a place to take the family to dinner. 

FOOD: 
You must must must try the avocado egg roll (if you love avocado that is)...I never had anything like it. What a light refreshing appetizer! 
Since previous reviews raved about the Macadamia nut Chicken that is what I ordered and I was not disappointed. It was a HUGE portion and I ate probably all of it.  The crust was was perfect...great mix of flavors and the potatoes were so good! I usually don&#39;t like to eat until I can&#39;t breathe...but I didn&#39;t want to leave any behind and I am not a fan of taking food home. 

Service was great and drinks (mojitos) were so good.

We headed out with our two infants and they put us in a large corner booth to accommodate them - thanks!!  We started with the satay and a soft shell crab roll - both very good.  I liked that the satay came with two sauces and it was on the side so you could control the amount.  I had the mahi mahi on special that day and it was delicious - made with a grape avocado salsa and plain steamed rice in a banana leaf.  Husband had the macadamia nut crusted chicken and thought it was &#34;ok&#34; - but he is tough to please.  I think he was put-out by the mashed potatoes (thought there was too much milk in them).

Kinda cool how you can watch them make it. Wasn&#39;t too found on Creme Brûlée as its way too lemony and crust is way to caramelized. Texture was off. Had mojitos but had to send the second one back wasn&#39;t too consistent with the first one. Maybe too much sour mix. Service is lovable. Kids loved our waitress Brenda as she entertained them. Nice enclosed patio seating. Not a bad place to take a lady for a date. Wish they had more draft beers. Will certainly be back in the near future.

This was before I really started to utilize Yelp, but my party (Ma and Bro) sounded interested, as was I, so we gave it a shot.

It&#39;s an Asian themed restaurant but they have other dishes, such as soups, salads,chicken, steak, sandwiches, flatbreads, and pork specialties.

I ordered the Macadamia Nut Chicken and, as you can see due to the timing of my review, it wasn&#39;t very memorable. I couldn&#39;t have told you what I got without looking at the menu on their website.

I didn&#39;t end up paying (Thanks Mom!) but I remember the restaurant being a bit cold (it was actually a cool Mid-August day), so that didn&#39;t help. I wasn&#39;t very satisfied with my meal, but I&#39;m sort of a pig, so there&#39;s that. The service wasn&#39;t great either. My drink was refilled but not after repeated requests. I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m overbearing with my refills, but whatever.

I would possibly go back to Kona for a date night or if I was going to give Sushi a shot. Both longshots, but I&#39;d be willing to give them a try. For now, a 3 star from me."

My expectation going into this evening was that Kona would be similar to a PF Changs or Wok and Fire.  Not even close.  These restaurants far exceed Kona in quality, atmosphere and service.  Food was average and the prices were appropriate for the quality and predictable atmosphere.  

However, I cannot express how disappointed we were with the service, starting at the hostess stand.  The staff was not welcoming and seemed to be challenged with seating our table, reserved on Open Table (we asked for 2 high chairs...), on a night when the dinning room was 1/2 full.  

We had to ask for enough dinner menus to accommodate 5 adults, it took 5+min for a waitress to greet us after we were seated, we had to ask for a wine list that was not provided, we had to ask for water for the table, we had to ask to tell us about the specials/fish for the day after the waitress finally greeted us, and the bar orders were much delayed, even when serviced by a manager.  

Then our waitress when MIA...After, I stopped two different managers, once for a wine refill and once for more water, I made an assumption that these subtle requests would be interpreted by management to possibly address the services issues with our table...I was wrong.  I provided my CC to pay the bill and had to ask another waitress to speak to process payment and speak to a manager.  Jasmine, who refilled my wine earlier, apologized for the dismal experience and left to adjust the bill.  She removed our 4 glasses of wine and 1 beer (for the entire table) and offered some complementary appetizer coupons for our next visit.  A nominal adjustment for a less than mediocre experience.  

Duration 1hr 45min."

I came here for a later evening bite to eat. It was happy hour which was great because some of the rolls were cheaper. I ended up getting a glass of wine and the Bama and Atlantic Roll. 

I&#39;ll be honest, I gave this place a handicap before I even sat down. Sushi from a chain restaurant with such a wide menu can only be so good. Anyway, the look of the restaurant was nice, more intimate, dimly lit. I had no issue with the service. The waitress was prompt and efficient. 

The wine, despite being a red, was served chilled. It was a bit odd. The Bama roll was my favorite of the two. It was topped with fresh, raw tuna and avocado and inside was cream cheese, japalpeno, crab salad. The flavor was good and the tuna was fresh, however the roll had not been made well by the chef and the pieces just fell apart when trying to pick them up off the plate.

As for the Atlantic roll, I wished I wouldn&#39;t have ordered it. It was shredded cooked salmon in a &#34;spicy aioli&#34; with cucumber and topped with tempura crunch. The salmon was really, really fishy. It totally overpowered everything. I the aioli was not spicy and I didn&#39;t even taste any cucumber."

Many friends have recently moved to europe and this was the final time to see them before they headed back over the pond.

We sat in the front garden part with all the windows and it was really warm with the fireplace and the heat lamps going. It was prefect for a cold day.

The waiter was patient with everyone&#39;s staggered arrival times and our inability to determine if we would drink anything but water. All 5 of us were recovering from various flu illnesses- likely all my fault to start with.  The flu rolled in on Dec 23 and today being 1/5 and 6 boxes of kleenex later, I&#39;m still sick with it.

I had the &#34;macadamia nut tacos&#34; which were not tacos at all but more like a wrap. There were 3 large wraps filled with a lot of crunchy veggies. It was huge and could be 2 meals easily.

The best part was the sauce though. I was thinking it wasn&#39;t going to go when I saw it was a &#34;honey mustard&#34; based thing. But it was prefect combo of sweet and sour with flakes of chili in it. 

Just yummy!"

It was the middle of the week and quite clear that their lunch business is only office workers from the surrounding area. The place was pretty empty.

The guys I was with were STARVING so we ordered the lettuce wraps and the eggrolls for a starter. I didn&#39;t try the eggrolls but they looked delicious. I loved the lettuce wraps - not as good as PF Chang&#39;s, but flavorful and appealing. I was basically full before we ordered the meal, but pushed onward. For lunch, I had the avocado chicken club, which was tasty but forgettable. The taro chips that came with it were interesting, however, and I enjoyed those. One of the guys I was with had steak, which he said was overdone, the other had the basil pesto linguine, which he absolutely HATED. Said it was very greasy (hello? pesto is oil based...) and lacked flavor. I didn&#39;t try it but he can sometimes have weird tastes, so I don&#39;t know if it actually sucked. It looked quite good.

The service was ridiculous though. Our waitress was just SUPER awkward (when we walked in in business suits, she comes skipping over to ask &#34;SO WHAT ARE WE CELEBRATING!?!?&#34; Uh). She kept trying to joke/flirt with one of my colleagues, even when he made it quite clear we were kind of in a rush and just wanted to order. It took 20 mins for them to flag her down for dessert, and another 30 mins for her to bring the check (even though we&#39;d asked for it when dessert arrived). We were so flustered by the lack of attention that I think the only way we GOT the check was a busboy overhearing our frustration and subsequently flagging her down.

My favorite part of the whole meal is that with my after-lunch latte, they served rock candy as the sugar. ROCK CANDY. REMEMBER THAT?! How GENIUS. I loved that little piece of nostalgia, and when dipped into a steamy latte, it worked perfectly!

Maybe when the place is super busy, it&#39;s runs more smoothly and the service is a bit more professional. I&#39;d probably come back to try this again, but definitely for lunch - I wouldn&#39;t shell out for dinner prices until I knew if our experience was the norm or not."

That being said, sometimes tastes change, and you never know if a chain restau in Texas might not be as good as one in a somewhat posh suburb like Oak Brook, IL.

Well, the yuppies were all out - which seemed to somehow astound my hubby.  The decor is ok, the lights are interesting and the tables are, thank goodness, not on top of each other.  

We started with a miso soup that was better than many, but nothing amazing. Still, not bad.  We also ordered a hot sake - and they are tiny!  I asked how the $7 glass of Sauvignon Blanc was... and the waitress replied, &#34;it&#39;s the most popular.&#34; Well that really doesn&#39;t tell me anything! It&#39;s probably the most popular because it&#39;s the most inexpensive.  It definitely wasn&#39;t for its somewhat metallic and thin, dry taste!  Later I dropped $9.50 for a glass of Alberino which was much better.  The pricing here, however, and not surprisingly, is a bit ridiculous.  That&#39;s to be expected though - this is an &#39;upscale&#39; sort of chain restaurant, so that goes with the territory.

Also with that territory comes sushi that is just &#39;OK&#39;.  We ordered the Picasso roll described as &#34;spicy yellowtail mix, avocado, jalapeño, cilantro, togarashi, sriracha, yuzu ponzu&#34;  - I don&#39;t know about you, but I am not all about seafood being &#39;mixed&#39; unless it tells you what it is mixed with. Either way, the jalapeno and cilantro with dots of srirachi on top made this roll somewhat fun and refreshing. It also came in a yuzu ponzu sauce, which was interesting and different. After a few bites, however, we just wished the sushi was better quality, as opposed to just a novelty.

We also got the Checkerboard roll and had them add jalapenos to it as well.  It is described thus: &#34;tuna, habanero tuna mix, yellowtail, avocado, asparagus, spicy motoyaki sauce.&#34;  My husband preferred this roll to the other, but not by much. Again, it was OK. Nothing special happening here.

We may be spoiled because of places like Jai-Yen in the city, which really do it right.  At least it wasn&#39;t terrible. But I wouldn&#39;t go back. You don&#39;t get what you pay for.

Well... strike that. I might be back. My sister and cousin tell me the &#39;angry edamame&#39; is worth a trip."

The food was absolutely delicious, and the presentation was also very well done. The drinks are a Lil expensive but if you want drinks thats what it cost. Our server, Nick was friendly and professional. He made good recommendations and was very courteous. For 2 people you can expect to pay about 30 dollars but you will leave full.

This last experience has me wondering if they&#39;re under new management or just don&#39;t give a damn. They&#39;re just not what they used to be. Came here on a Saturday around 8pm and it was PACKED. People were waiting and standing in the bar area, outside in the entrance area, and outside, but honestly that is not too surprising. It&#39;s a popular place and always have been. They told us the wait time would be 45-50 minutes and gave us one of those buzzers. We waited honestly the full 45 minutes and were seated. ****Tip**** The crowd died down around 9:15/9:30pm and there was no longer a wait time. You walked in and immediately was seated. 

I ordered what I typically always get and specifically come here for, the fish tacos and a swirl margarita. This drink I swear used to have me feeling some type of way after one. My memories of the swirl was a very tasteful/potent drink. Now, it&#39;s $9 of frozen water and color mix. The drink was so bland and weak I was tempted to send it back but didn&#39;t because since they pre-make them I figured the next one would of been just the same. It was the weakest drink from there I&#39;ve ever had out of all my years going. The fish tacos were Ok but were lacking that taste factor I am used to. The flavor was just not there this time. The tilapia fish pieces were dry and warm, not hot. I still love the salsa and chips. They still doing that right! I don&#39;t know maybe I caught them on an off night and will probably give them another chance eventually just to see if my feelings change, but right now I&#39;m just not feeling Uncle Julio&#39;s like I used to."

After being seated, we waited over 10 minutes to have waiter drop off chips and ask for our drink order. This was after watching him clear a table before even acknowledging us.
The rocks margaritas were good, but not worth the $9 charge. About 3 oz of drink to 6 oz of ice!
We ordered the chicken &amp; steak fajita for two. It was placed before us, and 5 minutes later we got our fajita shells. By then, the meat was cold... it was sent back.
A fresh plate of meat and onions arrived... there were peppers too, but only about 4 pieces. Meat was lean, but flavorless. Fajita shells were very good.
We did ask for a to go container. The gf had to get up and find it because we thought the waiter got lost looking for it.

I have not seen you in several years so thought I&#39;d stop by for dinner. I see the crowds are still coming as we had to wait 20 minutes past our reservation. I&#39;m so perplexed.  The chicken fajitas are just not the same. I was anticipating the sizzling plates of visits past that brought back fond memories of Southern Cal. Instead, bland, no sizzle, just luke warm. Plus, butter melted on top of my chicken. What&#39;s up with that?  Service seemed harried. And tables took longer to be bused than the good ole days. Still love the chips and salsa, but our chips were never refilled. I hate to use this term--mediocre, but that&#39;s what the family dinner came down to tonight.

Reminds me of Applebee&#39;s and Chilis, where you can&#39;t quite tell if they just microwaved the food.

I may be a bit of a Mexican snob, as tex-mex doesn&#39;t quite do it for me. True mexican food is fantastic, even Chiptole has it right. But there is something wrong here that will keep me from returning."

Service at 6pm on Wednesday was RIDICULOUSLY SLOW: it took our server 20 minutes - literally - to come and take our order. She asked what DRINKS we wanted. (Guuurl, we&#39;ve been waiting so long, we&#39;re ready with our FOOD order!) We also had to wait a long time for her to ever come back so we could request the check.

We were in the middle of the restaurant - not hidden away in some corner - and she passed us multiple times, so there&#39;s no real excuse to leave us hangin&#39; for so long.

The Fish Tacos were alright: on the larger side, stuffed 1/2 fish, 1/2 slaw with tomatoes and onions, a bit of heat, and flavorful enough. The avocado créma actually didn&#39;t do much to enhance the tacos, but held things together.  The $16 was steep for 3 tacos, .5c of beans, and 1c rice. The beans and rice were tasty, which doesn&#39;t usually happen with Mexican(-esque) fare.

Supposedly the drinks are fabulous, but I wouldn&#39;t know... and doubt I&#39;d chance the slow service and high price point again to find out."

Always crowded, and very noisy. Great for families or group of  friends.  Got there around 6 pm. Didn&#39;t have a reservation, wait time 45 min to an hour and they weren&#39;t kidding.   We decided to wait since driving anywhere else would take about the same time.  Thank goodness for the super crisp,warm chips and salsa. They held us over for awhile.   After finally getting seated, our waiter, Arthur was very attentive. 2 of us ordered the enchiladas with red sauce.  If you don&#39;t like &#39;hot&#39; food I wouldn&#39;t recommend.  It was a little too hot for me, so I had to send back for the milder version with meat sauce.  Arthur didn&#39;t seem to mind and actually bought out a sample so that we could taste before he placed a new order.  He was a pretty good waiter.  Overall, the food was okay.  It&#39;s starting to feel more like a chain than it ever has before.  Next time I will definitely make reservations and order the chicken nachos or tacos.  My friend really enjoyed her order."

What was so disappointing was the fact that  I convinced my spouse to take me because my experience at the Orland Park location was so...awesome.

Food

Jalisco - Fajita dish (steak, chicken and shrimp with butter sauce). The chicken and steak was good however the shrimp were so over cooked  it was comparable to eating chewing gum. There were very few vegetables. The rice and beans were luke warm. 


Steak Fajitas - My spouse had the steak fajitas and there were again very few vegetables. The rice and beans were luke warm.


Tableside Guacamole - There was only 1 person making guacamole for the ENTIRE restaurant. On a Saturday come on. We no longer needed the appetizer by the time he would arrive and wanted to cancel the order. I can say that this person was working really hard and he even came to apologize for the delay.



Service 

We were greeted by the hostess and seated immediately per our reservation made with the Open Table application. This was a big plus one of the few. Upon being seated our waiter greeted us and we ordered drinks and appetizers. The drinks came promptly and we were offered a refill once. After waiting 10 minutes we placed our food order thinking our appetizer would arrive soon after. The appetizer never came and our waiter became aware that the appetizer never arrived and advised us that the manager would be visiting our table. The manager did come by and offered guacamole to take home. 

Upon the arrival of our dinner I received the correct order however, my spouse received a chicken/steak fajita dish when he ordered steak only. The waiter came out 5-7 minutes later with the correct steak fajita dish. We initially had to ask for the tortillas and was given a whopping 4 tortillas to share for 2 separate dishes.

Atmosphere

LOUD!!!!


Overall we did not have the experience to match the price spent on gas and food. We will not be visiting the Lombard Uncle Julio&#39;s restaurant again."

This isn&#39;t &#34;authentic&#34; mexican food.  This is so Americanized that the food gets lost in translation.  

Although, I have to admit, they have one of the best tamales I&#39;ve ever had.  The corn meal with shredded chicken and pork is super moist with a little bit of sweetness.  But I&#39;m pissed they changed their tomatilo salsa.  Now, the tamales are accompanied by this green creamy sauce.  It looks like infant diarrhea- limey green bile looking.  It&#39;s gross.

I had the grilled fish tacos.  Great corn tortilla but just too much salsa and cabbage.  The fish just gets lost in all of it.  

Their chips and salsa are so addicting.  Don&#39;t order an appetizer because the chips are filling. It&#39;s pretty much bottomless refills.  So much that our waitress took away our half eaten bowl of chips WHILE we were still eating them...like our HANDS were still picking up the chips as she took it away. HAHAHAHA to some people  that would be rude but bless her heart it was funny.  She just kept giving us new bowls of chips when we were only halfway into them.  She was cool though and took care of us very well."

There were may empty tables at 1:00 pm on a Wednesday- but everyone was seated so close together that the noise from conversations was uncomfortably loud. We asked for a booth or a seat at one of the empty bar tables but were told that it was &#34;not possible&#34;.

Gal Pal and I have made successful purchases at local shopping establishments and as tradition, decide to reward ourselves with adult beverages and a snack before carrying on with more shopping adventure.  Little did we realize that we have unfortunately selected the worst faux-Mexican fare restaurant in the southwest suburbs!

First clue: The snarling stare we received upon entering from SHE of the short-short booty short, our &#39;hostess&#39;, and we use that term lightly.  No pleasantries would be had as SHE attempted to squeeze us into an unreasonably undersized booth in the raucous main dining room filled with squealing children and parents who clearly were at a loss of that decibel range.

Our request to be moved into the less crowded second dining room, where upon entry one notices that there IS actual music playing on the overhead, albeit not Mexican, was met with a &#34;harrumph&#34; as SHE marched us right back, dropping the menus on the table and quickly exiting without a word.

Gal Pal notices that we are within Happy Hora and as such beverage discounts abound on the menu.  Waiter number Uno dumps a bowl of crispy salty chips and salsa with his greeting, asking for drink selections which we provide - leaving without an offer of water or hearing the advance request for a second round to be queued up.  Gal Pal is parched and tries in vain to secure a glance from Uno or any of the other servers who are hustling into the din of the main dining room.

Uno returns with a single set of drinks and leaves without water offer a second time.  SHE glares at us as seething returning to the room with a second couple and abruptly seats them in the booth behind us. Waiter number Dos greets us and asks if we need drinks without looking to see we have them. Gal Pal asks if we can order and Dos leaves to find Uno to take care of the table. Uno is seen rushing through the dining room and Gal Pal wonders (she has the better view, I am looking at the wall beyond her) if he is working both sections of the restaurant.

Uno returns to rattle off the specials but by now he has to do some explaining about food preparation as Gal Pal would like to know some specifics.  He accommodates and as he turns away a third time, we remind him that we would like some water and the second round as tick-tock Happy Hora time is running out. Andale! 

Bebidas arrive before Comida which was prompt and as ordered, served by someone else and it is nothing to write home about.  I doubt that the specials were just average too. Uno never returns to ask about it, so its clear that we are on our own.

Entertainment abounds!  This evening&#39;s warm up act begins with the booth behind me spectacularly spilling an enormity of liquid on the floor. The manager, and other servers and wait staff literally step over the mess without as much as a word to those around to inquire if they are in need of extra napkins.  Fifteen minutes pass before someone arrives with a mop that has clearly seen better days.  BRUTO!  

The main attraction, the new Chocolate Pinata, arrives at the table next to Gal Pal, where Mister, Missus, toddler and baby-child in highchair await the giant tray of delight.  Much fanfare is made of the desert which include a wooden dowel wrapped in a cloth napkin, handed to the Mister to &#39;crack open&#39; the Pinata tableside.  A &#34;WOW&#34; is heard from a neighboring table.  Mister really swings at the fragile desert scaring the CRAP out baby-child who is in the direct line of fire of his forward swing. Contents falls from Pinata, screaming ensues and Gal Pal shows me the tableside placard for this fiesta moment running roughly $25.

After trying to flag Uno for our check, we leave the second dining room as loud as we found the first with people waiting in line outside.

Hasta La Vista, baby!  We won&#39;t be back despite that new Chocolate Pinata radio campaign."

Very busy on weekends and noise level makes it hard to hear unless you sit outside or near the far corners. I loved the veggie quesadillas, veggie fajitas, and their new Chocolate Piñata (huge chocolate egg shape hanging down with fruit inside and handmade churros for $25). I am vegetarian but those who ordered steak tacos or chicken fajitas said hey loved it. Be cautious! Chips and salsa can fill you up especially if you get an appetizer cause their portions big.

The chocolate piñata- $25, it was good, not great. Waiter hurried us to crack it, we wanted pictures. Perfect size for 2 guests. Nothing to rave about, looks cooler than it is. The chocolate shell is just way too much chocolate, the inside was good. 

For food- I had the carne asada. The meat was wonderful and so soft/juicy

Husband had camarones diablo. Being Hispanic we assumed it was similar to camarones a la diabla (his favorite dish) and it was so off. Just 6 large shrimp, that is it. No sauce. Served with butter.. wouldn&#39;t get it again, especially for price..

Atmosphere was ok.. until I had to go to the bathroom and a bussboy walks past me and says, &#34;mamasita&#34;.. pretty inappropriate and I was kindve disgusted... not cool."

First off, the margaritas are unique.  They are famous for their swirl, a mix of sangria and margarita but I had the seasonal fresh fruit margarita.  This time it was cucumber, phenomenal.  

The food is good.  The guacamole is fantastic as they make it fresh for you right next to your table.  It&#39;s obviously entertaining and they can make adjustments to what goes in, the more jalapeños the better.  They&#39;ve got several types of guacamole too, something not many places have. 

The only thing I could say was that the service was somewhat slow BUT it was incredibly busy and the server apologized several times and did what he could to accommodate us.  The apology went a long way with us as we could see he did care about his job.  This place could be a fun spot to grab drinks and apps, so if you&#39;re feeling some Mexican food, it&#39;s worth a look."

After finally being seated- we waited 10 minutes without a single worker even looking at us as they walked by and served adjacent tables. 

Finally a worker walked by and asked, &#34;Has anybody come by to take a drink order yet?&#34;  We said, &#34;nope! Not a single person has even said hello&#34;. 

Another 5 minutes rolls by, and we saw the one server go to the host and say we had not been touched yet. A blond 16 year old host looked at us, then went back to work. Still nobody came. 

At that point my blood was boiling. So I hopped on OpenTable and made a reservation for WeberGrill (next door). 

We walked out. And the blond host says, &#34;oh- thank you for coming!&#34;  Totally clueless that we&#39;d been ignored. I told her we had waited close to 20 minutes without being so much as looked at. And that we were headed to another restaurant. &#34;Oh- gee... I&#39;m reeeeealy sorry!&#34;

Glad we left. I will NEVER be back. The food I had here before was way overpriced. $20 meat fajitas? Too salty. And service has always been amateur hour. Imagine 16 year old clueless kids trying to run a restaurant.

Usually, the experience is decent and service is also decent.  We were seated and ordered our usual favorites, which happen to be the enchiladas.  Upon ordering, my mom stated she wanted &#34;easy&#34; cheese, since sometimes they overdo the cheese.  The waiter then tells us that the enchiladas don&#39;t come with cheese.  We were both confused.  What?  Of course enchiladas come with cheese.  It&#39;s baked in and then some is also scattered on top and melts!  We then thought, maybe he means there is no cheese in the red/green sauce choices.  OK.  

The meals come out.  They are BOTH completely devoid of cheese, inside and outside, even though I did not even say anything about easy cheese for my dish.  WTF!  I don&#39;t want to waste it, so I ask him to bring a side of cheese, even thought the whole point of enchiladas is the baked in cheese inside and outside.  He brings a side of cheese after asking what kind.  We are like, whatever is supposed to be in it!!!! I try saving the dish by adding cheese, but it doesn&#39;t even melt because both our plates are COLD.  This is the last straw and I ask to see the manager, because I don&#39;t even want to eat here anymore and do not want to wait for another meal to be made.  I&#39;ve lost my appetite at this point.  

The waiter does NOT even call the manager.  He just brings us our check for $3.00 for the Sprite we ordered.  Okay, whatever.  Needless to say, I&#39;m not leaving a tip and we just leave.  Awful experience.  I don&#39;t think I will be going back any time soon, even though I did like coming here on occasion.

I think someone else made a comment that it seems like frozen food and similar type of food to a Chili&#39;s or Applebee&#39;s (yuck)  -couldn&#39;t agree more.

She took about 10 minutes from the moment we were arrived to the time she took our order.  We ordered the table side guacamole, our main dish and drinks. When our food arrived, the waitress put the container with the tortillas on top of the guacamole molcajete instead of clearing the table first. After our food arrived, she never once asked how we were doing. Our drinks never came and we had to ask another waiter for our check. We asked to speak with a manager to point out our dissatisfaction and she gave us a discount. We were not looking for a discount, although it was a gesture we accepted due to the nature of our bad experience."

I ordered Chiles Rellenos, which should be a fairly simple mexican dish, and they were bland and super stuffed with bland cheese.  To whomever made my dish, overstuffing the peppers with bland cheese doesn&#39;t make them better.  *Sigh.  I&#39;ve had better chiles rellenos from a small shack and they were not $17.  Btw, I am Mexican and my mom would have returned the plate and demanded that we go somewhere else if she had come with us.

Service was meh; nothing too spectacular, a few hiccups here and there, and our waiter had the softest voice I had ever heard. BUT that being said, we can be quite the rambunctious crowd, and he didn&#39;t lose his mind so ten points to Gryffindor! (Imaginary brownie points to you if you got that haha)

Food:

A) Carne Asada: about three of us ordered this. I definitely recommend this for the carnivore in your life. Mesquite grilled, marinated beef skirt steak that is chargrilled. Juicy, sizzling hot perfection! Love this one! It comes with a side of pinto beans (get black beans if you want it vegetarian/without pork), rice, cheese and guac. Sub out the rice for extra beans if you&#39;re low-carbing! Few more substitutions will make this paleo/primal :). A good hunk of meat for a really good price 10/10

B) Red Snapper Fajitas: These were ok. Red snapper was grilled, and served with a chipotle crema and sautéed sweet peppers. Conceptually a good idea, but the fish was not marinated and not particularly fresh. A non marinated fish would not have been too big an issue if there was an ingredient/spice blend that harmonized the snapper along with the other accompaniments. Plated presentation of dish was fair. Overall? 6/10

C) Table side guacamole: This one is always a lot of fun. Quick glance makes it seems like you are overpaying, but you aren&#39;t! You actually get a lot more bang for your buck, and a server comes over and custom makes the guac from scratch right in front of you. You get to control the amount of onions, tomatoes, jalepeno, lime, cilantro that you want. You can put as much or as little of any of the ingredients as you want. We loved this so much we got a second order of this later on. 10/10, but can be 1/10 if you don&#39;t know what to tell the server to put in it, and you end up making bad decisions lol. 

D) Soft Steak Tacos: Quite good. The tortillas used are flour tortillas. They&#39;re made in house, and are quite soft. Steak was well marinated, and chopped to perfectly sized pieces. Not too overbearing or too big of a proportion. 8/10

E) Chicken and Steak Quesadilla: Appetizer. We got 1/2 chicken and 1/2 steak. Steak and chicken pieces are both well marinated, and enveloped in melty ooey-gooey monterey jack cheese, onions, tomatoes, with a side of guac and sour cream. 7/10

F) Nachos: We opted to have our with ground beef. Came with beans, cheddar, monterey jack, jalepeno, guac, sour cream. Very good; but honestly its hard to mess up nachos! 8.5/10

Service hiccups :

A) I specifically ordered my steak well done, no red/pink at all. I wanted it dead-er than deadmau5 (again, imaginary brownie points to you if you got that!) Despite the waiter saying that the meat would be butterflied to ensure it was exceptionally &#34;grey&#34; on the inside, this was not the case, and despite the waiter coming by and seeing me peer around the carne asada and stab it a couple times with my fork, one of the other guests at my table had to hail down the waiter and had to tell him I was displeased with the dish, to which at that point he offered to have the dish sent back. Mind you it was a Thursday night, not a weekend, so it wasn&#39;t too terribly busy. 

B) We loved the table side guac so much we wanted another round. Instead of bringing out the table side guac cart a side of guacamole was brought out instead. We had to hail a different waiter to explain the situation before our own waiter came over. 

C) Despite our party being 10 people the waiter never once asked if there were any food allergies or restrictions. We did have dietary restrictions that I had to proactively vocalize to the waiter. 

TL;DR: Good place to come with a large group or a pound group. Super casual (jeans, tshirts, sneakers are totally fine). Get table side guac and Carne Asada. Skip the Red Snapper Fajitas. Had to proactively vocalize to waiter dietary restrictions and a few dish mishaps."

We sat at the bar and ate the aforementioned chips and salsa. It was really good. We got seated but not until I had to go up to the hostess and ask why after  twenty minutes and other people being seated before us. I asked and was told &#34;your table is ready&#34;. Weird.

We sat down and ordered the ceviche fresco. THere was a ton of lime and cilantro plus the little tostada chips! Good job, Uncle Julio. Funny side note: Bartender told us Uncle Julio does not exist. The franchise was founded by a Lebanese man! Anyways, we split the chicken and steak fajitas for two. It came with all the FIXINS&#39; (EASTBOUND AND DOWN REFERENCE) but the steak wasn&#39;t even cooked. We had to ask for it to be actually cooked. Turned out great.

Not bad for two people and around 60 bucks. UNCLE JULIO IS NOT REAL."

After reviewing the menu I asked where the burritos were.  He was very nice and told me that they don&#39;t have burritos....WHAT????  I decided on the fajitas.  They came out very quickly.  They were nondescript.  The salsa was ok.  The service was ok.  This place is...ok."

My 2 star review will just be white noise since a lot of people really seem to like this place.

The restaurant looks dynamite inside and out - very colorful and whatnot.  The place is kind-of loud which suits us just fine since our young son talks in a bit of a yell.  We thought our server was going to be on the ball this night, but after taking our drink order and bringing our appetizer, he pretty much forgot us.  The food wasn&#39;t so great - any suburban taqueria will blow this place away.  4 non-alcoholic beverages, 3 entrées, an kids-meal and an appetizer set us back a hundo and change.  Like I said, there were probably a dozen taquerias within a 10 minute drive that would&#39;ve been hella-better."

The best thing about the food is they have a strong appetizer line-up. Each table gets a basket of tortilla chips made within the restaurant (1 basket= 2-3 people) and cup of some excellent roasted pepper salsa. Aside from the salsa, you can order some creamy, well seasoned guacamole made at your table among some other types of dip that were probably just as good.

When our entrees came around, I was surprised to see that they appeared to be cheaper looking than the awesome appetizers. I was right. Flavors were good but one dimensional and most dishes come with a side of beans that I didn&#39;t care for at all. 

The service was decent but our waiter looked pretty frantic running around past other servers. I went to the bathroom about 20 feet from my table and I probably saw over 10 servers on my way there.

I think they&#39;d make an excellent catering company."

Started with the tableside guacamole, which is a very large fresh tasty bowlful. The chips are thin, crunchy, plentiful and delicious. 
We had various tacos and enchiladas. All were very good.
The star of the day was the spectacular chocolate pinata. What&#39;s not to love?

My husband had flautas,they were pretty good..I had the Cozumel shrimp tacos and I wished I had got the flautas too, tacos were filled with all the other stuff and like 3 shrimp.  So I&#39;m not going to go into too much detail, all I gotta say is, lower your expectations, have a fruity refreshing drink, sit on the patio and enjoy time with your family.

Uncle Julio&#39;s was the nearest restaurant on foot and I quickly learned that it is a favorite of my cousin&#39;s.  There was ice all around the restaurant, so it would have been nice if they had salted a bit.  I know that it&#39;s late in the season, but I still don&#39;t want to fall.  The immediate good news?  The hostess was lovely even though we were walking in just an hour before the restaurant was scheduled to close.

We took a seat at a booth in the back and had great service for the next hour!  It was my first time and I was immediately unsure of what I wanted because everything sounded so good.  That&#39;s good and bad.  Thankfully, they had a combo plate and before long we both decided on the same combo with a few variations.

The food arrived before we could hardly get into our conversation.  Hmmmm.  This made me nervous.  Here&#39;s my take...  They cook the food in advance and plate/heat when it&#39;s ordered.  The food was all fine.  Nothing exciting and nothing awful.  The sauces were fairly tasty and that&#39;s probably what keeps them afloat at three stars for me.  The food is overpriced for not being cooked from scratch at the time the order is placed.  I imagine that I will go back, but I will stick to something a little less pricey to make myself feel better."

We went here earlier this week for my brother&#39;s birthday.  We were told there was a 45 minute wait and that we had 8 parties ahead of us.  While waiting we saw plenty of empty tables that were never filled.  After 45 minutes we asked if our table was ready and the hostess told us we had about 7 minutes left.  15 minutes later we asked the hostess again if our table was ready.  She said no and that it may still be awhile because we had 4 parties in front of us still.  Anyone who can do simple math can tell it would take us about another hour until we get our table since it took an hour for 4 parties to leave.  They should have been upfront with us when we asked how much time was remaining instead of telling us it would be approximately 7 minutes.  We left and went to Las Palmas instead where we were sat immediately.

The tortillas were cold and stiff and there were literally so many flies in the restaurant, I couldn&#39;t even eat because they kept landing on my food. I was completely grossed out.

Well designed dishes keep the hot stuff from the cold stuff. It was ready on time and everything was pretty hot by the time I got home.  A couple of things were a bit soggier than they&#39;d be in a restaurant--but let&#39;s be realistic.  If you put something hot into a container that will also contain steam (see hot food) then naturally some will seep into everything.  Understanding that, it was all good.  Ginormous bag of chips.

Instead of just throwing the ingredients over each other, each nacho chip, which is big, gets their own piece of meat, along with refried beans and cheese. In the middle of the platter is some pico de gallo, sour cream and guacamole if I remember correctly. We only come once or twice a year because it can get pricey and this is a &#34;special occasion&#34; restaurant for us.

Their tacos are meh but everything else makes up for it. I&#39;ve since replaced the taco meal I get with their chicken enchiladas with green sauce and YUM! They have good portion sizes for everything we&#39;ve gotten.

They bring out chips and salsa at the beginning. I wish Uncle Julio&#39;s would sell that salsa in the grocery store because it is so good and spicy. They make their own chips and you can tell (a good thing I assure you!).

What I love though is their flan! In the fall time they have a pumpkin spice flan which I will eat even if I&#39;m overstuffed. I didn&#39;t think this flan could be topped until we went during Valentine&#39;s Day when they had CHOCOLATE flan.::drool::

The service is really good, which is to be expected since it is pricey. It can get a bit loud depending on when you go. During Valentines&#39;s Day, I recommend a reservation. The hostesses are very nice."

The retaurant in the city is much better. The steak fajitas are pretty good but not the best I&#39;ve ever had. There salsa is not that good and lacks the freshness that you would expect. 

They have outdoor seating so it&#39;s not a bad place for a summer margarita or a swirl which is sangria and margarita frozen together... the only reason i ranked it a 3 instead if a 2!"

I wanted some authentic Mexican food and what I got was subpar food at best.  My husband and I sat in the bar area, which i have to admit was clean and very colorful, and ordered 2 mojitos.  Love those drinks.  The drinks were great but for $12 each they could have given us a taller glass.  I have gotten more drink cheaper at TGIF and they are equally as good.  Move to the dining area for our dinner and for what we ordered the price and portions doesnt not add up.  Husband had steak fajitas that were full of veggies and chewy steak.  Steak could have used a little more marinating.   I had the enchiladas which were skimpy and the rice was dry and a lil hard.  Like i said mediocre food.  Will not be back."

Just call it Uncle Julio&#39;s Food, because Fine Mexican, it is not.  It is a cute place to go, with bright colors, loud music, with tables and chairs from your grandmother&#39;s kitchen.  Probably a great place for co-workers to kick back together with sangria or a margarita.  If you expect tasty and authentic food, not so much.

We came in here on a Thursday night.  Although crowded, we were seated right away.  Our server came and introduced herself, I think.  It was so loud in the place, and our server so softspoken, she could have been telling me to go to hell for all I knew.  After looking briefly at the menu,we ordered, hoping our server heard us, and vice-versa.

We started with guac and chips.  For $8, I do expect a little more than one small ice cream scoop of avacado with little else mixed in.  That was a total letdown.  Main course: Not much better, bordering on terrible.  My husband&#39;s chicken tacos were nothing but grilled chicken cubes (which we were upcharged for) and paired with rice and beans.  My fish tacos were too salty to even eat.  I managed to choke down one, but that was it.

Not much here for me to even think about returning."

We walked in and were &#34;greeted&#34; by a very unhappy hostess. I asked for a table for two. She sat us right away. She sat us at a table but my friend and I prefer booths (we are a little picky). I asked for an empty booth a step away. She rolled her eyes and places the menus on the table and walked away. We both were put off by this behavior. 

But our server turned around our attitude. He was nice and bubbly. He told us about the fresh watermelon margarita which we both order. It was great. Light and fresh. We ordered the fajitas for two. But our food came out 10 minutes later. Which was really weird. We were ok with it because we were hungry. But we wanted more time to relax. 

Our last little &#34;uh oh&#34; was when another set of margaritas were charged on our bill. We advised our waiter, he seemed annoyed but took care of it. 

The fajitas were good. The chicken was seasoned and the veggies were crisp. We each got aides to ourselves. Also, our server came around a few times to check that we had fresh tortillas. Which was appreciated. 

Not sure if I would go back. I would prefer el famous burrito."

The servers used to be friendly and trained, but it doesn&#39;t appear so anymore. I feel bad I never posted a good review when they were great. The last three visits have confirmed to me it wasn&#39;t a one time deal. Their shortcuts to cutting costs are more important than consistent high quality food and service.

Not for any particular reason, mind you, more just a combination of a newfound appreciation for early mornings and a sad realization that hangovers become harder with age. LAME. I do however make exceptions, and the Uncle julio&#39;s swirl drink is one if them. frozen margarita swirled with sangria? To diiiiie for. It&#39;s cold, sweet, and boozy. I LOVE it.

The rest of the Uncle Julio&#39;s experience, I could take or leave. The wait time is always astronomical - two hours for a table of three?!?! The service is so/so, and the prices are exorbitant. I do find the food to be delicious, though. Last visit, I got the fajitas, and the steak was perfectly cooked, the portion was huge, and the fajita accoutrements were perfect - fresh tortillas, charred peppers, etc.

If you have a LOT of time to kill for delicious mexican food with less than awesome service and WAY more than awesome drinks, check out Uncle Julio&#39;s. If not, go local - there are lots of mom and pop mexican joints doin it just as well, for less."

The restaurant was pretty crowded but at 6:30 pm we were easily seated.  They have outdoor seating, which looked nice and I would have preferred it because o...m...g......  IS THIS PLACE LOUD!  We could barely hear each other over the din.  Seriously bad.  Climate control was also a problem.  Most of the people in my group complained of being cold.  

This isn&#39;t your typical Mexican restaurant.  For one thing, it&#39;s expensive.  They have the usual Mexican offerings but the menu concentrates on more premium dinners. I was surprised to see so many menu items in the $20+ range.  I had the Mesquite Salmon, which came with grilled vegetables and a very spicy pineapple mix.  Good, not great.  Didn&#39;t hear anyone exclaiming anything good or bad about their meals.

We had the tableside-made guacamole  Little bit of fun for alotta guac but worth $12?  eh...  You can dictate your mix so perhaps I would have liked it better had I been with less flavor-timid dining partners.

What I didn&#39;t like was my drink.  I had their standard margarita, like $9, and for that I got a glass FULL of ice and a couple ounces of drink.  I&#39;m not a big person so I expect to feel some effect from a drink.  Nothing.  There was a strong flavor with my first sip so I suspect there was some loading of the straw with little of anything but mix in the glass.  Not good.

Our party was large and very particular, especially in the &#34;gluten free&#34; realm.  The manager was very attentive to those needs and our server was terrific for a high maintenance table."

They give you tons of light chips with dip. You can ask for spicy dip too and they will bring it for free. We got fajitas which are large enough to split the one portion. The flour tortilla is thick and fills you up quick. The salad has good lime dressing and is large portion as well.

Someone chose to check out Uncle Julio&#39;s and none of us had been there, so I was eager to try it!  I think it had been the coldest day of the year and when I attempted to find parking I realized that the lot was just set up all wrong!  Though we had reservations for 6:30 they didn&#39;t have a table ready for us and made us wait until 7 when 2 other parties left so they could move tables together.  Meanwhile, there were several walk-ins seated before us!  That left the 8 of us pretty annoyed and being pushed out out of the way as people were coming in.

Once we were finally seated we all ordered a round of drinks.  I asked if I could order a Mango Passion Rita with a replacement of vodka which made up of 1800 Reposado, peach schnapps, mango and passion fruit purée.  I also asked if I could have it blended.  The server discussed it with me at length before she went to ask if they would do it.  Since it was listed on the menu and they have a blender I didn&#39;t understand why she could just ask them to do it rather than tell me over and over that they may not do it.  She never really told me the answer and finally came back with all of our drinks including mine.  I explained to her that I could not have tequila due to stomach issues.  I shouldn&#39;t have had to have a lengthy discussion with her about it.


For dinner I ordered Beef Enchiladas with beef sauce served with Mexican rice and frijoles a la charra.  It was good though I think our favorite hole in the wall down the street is actually better tasting and definitely cheaper!  I did enjoy the meal and the leftover that I had for lunch today.  I just can&#39;t justify the cost of coming here over our regular places where we get in and out quicker, are treated better, and pay less for tastier food!"

The place is very large and has several separate areas. I like the back bar area because of all of the tvs. I have been here many times and the server I had last night was very attentive and knew the menu. 

I got chicken wings bone in with hot sauce. I have had much better wings than this, but they do the trick. Millers is more known for the zingers. They are a cross between boneless chicken wings and chicken fingers. They are breaded and seasoned. I also got the Saturday special which was the sirloin steak and crab legs or coconut shrimp. Is also comes with a vegi and a side. I got the sweet potato fries and the broccoli. It was all very good except the snow crab legs which I tried to tell my gf but she wanted them. About what you would expect at a sports bar. I&#39;m sure the coconut shrimp are better. For dessert I got the signature ice cream captain cake. I enjoyed it.

They always have very good drink specials especially on beer. I also get the $5 double shot of captain or Smirnoff and a mixer.

Not the greatest food in the area, but the tv&#39;s, drink specials, and price make it a appealing place for many."

I go to Millers a couple of times a month and even with a few things now and then I really like everything but yesterday was the worst service and problems we have had there. 
When we came in we were seated near the bar and the music was so loud we asked to move and they were great as far as that was. So we were seated and Sonya was our server and she wasn&#39;t the worst but not very good, not a smile not welcome to Millers just nothing and that&#39;s how the whole meal went.

We started out with onion rings and when she brought them we didn&#39;t have any knives and she didn&#39;t bring any plates which we had to ask for. She than came and took our order again no smile so we ordered and I orders a cheese burger no pickle or tomato and an onion ring on top not really a hard order. Everyones order came out first and they started eating so mine comes out with everything I didn&#39;t want on it plus no onion ring so I sent it back. I hate pickles and even to just take them off just ruins everything with their taste. The server never came to say she was sorry and I cancelled the order since by the time I would have gotten it everyone else would have been just about done it was only than that she came to the booth and asked is I wanted any soup or salad or anything else but again no I&#39;m sorry. So I just picked off everyone else plate but was really unhappy.
The other problem was that my daughter only wanted the childrens shrimp and I&#39;m not sure if you can order it or not for an adult however our server just told us that she thought we couldn&#39;t she never even went and asked if it could be done or not which I didn&#39;t understand and if the answer was still no than okay but at least make an effort to take care of your customers.
We spent almost 60.00 with me not eating and I left very upset since I ended up having to eat the garbage at the flea market."

As the wings got to our table we both ate 2. On my 3rd wing I bite into I immediately had to spit it out because of a horrific smell. (Manure) I passed the wing to my friend to smell to make sure I was not crazy and she threw it down on the table with disgust.

I sprinted to the restroom and threw up. When I got back I told the waitress that the wings were bad and she told me that she would get the manager to come over. 20 minutes later(I was literally about to leave) he comes over with the bill and rudely asks what is wrong with the bill. I proceeded to tell him that the chicken was bad. He looks up with attitude and says &#34;I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not the chicken.&#34; I told him that it was the chicken and he should smell it... Again, he repeats himself. Finally after giving all the proof I had that the chicken was bad walks away and mumbles &#34;we have the bill.&#34;

I believe the managers name is Tony Siccaro. (Short guy, baldish head, with glasses)

I have NEVER had to walk out of a restaurant before. I have NEVER not paid for my bill. This was the worst restaurant experience.

Millers Ale House has the worlds worst management. Listen to your customers!

This place NEEDS to be inspected."

I eat here often and have tried a variety of foods.  My favorites are the Barbecue Ribs and the Cajun Chicken  Pasta.  My husband&#39;s favorite food is the 35 Shrimps.  The servers are great and the prices are economical.  My favorite location is in Lombard, IL.   This restaurant is worth trying!  You will love it!

Even when the cubs game was going on last night and was super busy the service was nice and quick and there wasn&#39;t an attitude. I got the zinger salad last night and it was amazing! They forgot the dressing i asked but I didn&#39;t mind cause it tasted delicious without it. The chicken tasted delicious and the salad was fresh. And I&#39;m picky on my salads lol. The food and service is always great here and won&#39;t stop coming here when we want something different. They have a restaurant area and a bar in one part and then when you go through these doors there&#39;s just a full on bar section with tables. You can order food from anywhere. There&#39;s a great atmosphere and everyone is friendly.

I wrote that e-mail as soon as I saw the comment. I still have not received a response from Miller&#39;s, which makes this even worse. 

I highly, highly recommend picking a different spot for dinner or drinks."

The whole place is huge allowing for bigger groups and room to spread out. You don&#39;t feel cramped. 
The food was very good. Not great or amazing. But good. I had the Maine lobster which was on special. It came with Cole slaw and I requested the loaded baked potato for a side. The lobster was delicious. No issues there. The potato was good but very salty due to the skin.
I also had the mountain of zingers which is basically loaded French fries with small chicken fingers in it. These were the best thing.
The staff was also very friendly and quick to serve. No complaints there. 
I will most likely visit again but it won&#39;t necessarily be just for the food."

My gf has been bartending for 15 years and turned it away but kudos to our waitress for recognizing it.  Shrimp cesar and chicken cesar salad was okay.  Crumble apple pie was delicious!  This place had like over 30 LED flat screens spread out on every wall!  That&#39;s a plus because I hate it when I have to turn my head to see a tv AT A SPORTS BAR.

I came in around 3 PM yesterday with two of my girl friends. We had a great server and there were pitches of $10 margaritas. For a wind down after work, it was perfect. We split the zinger fries which my friend told me they&#39;re known for. They were pretty good, but not overly amazing. They were $12 and probably not enough for us to split. My two friends ended up splitting another order of hot zingers. 

We shared two pitchers of margarits and we all walked out feeling good. I recommend them as they made them strong in my opinion. (My friends drink margaritas all the time though and said they were average.) We also ordered the dessert even though I felt like I needed to be rolled out of here already. There was a nice guy server in a Blackhawks jersey that brought it out. When he heard me get excited about the cherry on top, he offered to bring out 2 more cherries for my friends. His friendly service, as well as our other server get 5 stars. 

Overall though I&#39;d give it a 3. It was decent for a happy hour type place, but I can&#39;t say I&#39;d make it my new after-work stop or even a dinner spot."

It was a bunch of fries on a plate, cheese, bacon with these chicken fingers that were suppose to be garlic...no flavor what so ever. For dinner my daughter ordered the chicken parmesan, the cheese was melted in the chicken... Cold! Pasta with flavorless sauce! Just gross! 
My son ordered a burger...it was just ok. My husband and I ordered the sirloin and ribs. Where do I start? Ribs were bone dry, no sauce. Sirloin was cold in the center, baked potato tasted like it was sitting under a warmer for days... It tastes old. Never again will I go there. Flavorless, old, dry, food. I DO not recommend."

The menu also has a great variety from seafood, to burgers, to chicken sandwiches: all great pairings with an IPA.

I love all the wood paneling, wood booths, and fish-themed decorations. It reminds me of being in a Florida Ale House. Prices are relatively cheap compared to other Lombard Restaurants around the mall and Butterfield, and the atmosphere is relaxed.

The restaurant seemed short-staffed when we were here. The host was the same as our waiter! More power to him for multi-tasking, but I think he had too many responsibilities and was not able to check on us as frequently as I would have liked.

Based on the atmosphere and prices, this place is more of a 3.5 star range, but I wouldn&#39;t push it to 4 stars. The quality of the food is just meh. I got a burger with sautéed onions, sautéed mushrooms, cheddar cheese, and all the fixings. I asked for it medium but the burger was not juicy and tasted overdone. Not quite what I was looking for, when I was ravenous after a long 18 hole game down the street.

I would come here again, it&#39;s an agreeable place, and maybe try something new off the menu."

There&#39;s tvs everywhere, a bar in the middle of the restaurant and also in the lounge area on the far end of the building. I really have never had a bad seat. 

Food is always decent. I&#39;ve tried almost everything on the menu except for fish so I don&#39;t know how that is but I&#39;ve never been disappointed with anything else. 
Good beers on tap. Sad that the one I wanted tonight they had just ran out of but it worked out ok.  They have tons of other choices and good cocktails as well!

They always have a good drink and food special. Tonight it was $8.95 for 5 Bud Lights that we chose to partake in :) 

Service is hit or miss. I&#39;ve had really lame waitresses and really personable ones like the one we had tonight, Beth, she was great.

This is a regular meeting place for my friends and I. We actually have been here the last 3 years for March Madness and it&#39;s awesome.

This isn&#39;t anything special. 

Miller&#39;s is a nice-looking, but typical bar &amp; grill with a typical menu. First impression based on atmosphere? Not bad. Impression based on the food? Meh. Tortilla chips were flavorless, although the spinach dip and salsa were somewhat edible. Fish &amp; chips were nothing spectacular -- no flavor, no pizzazz, just bland fish and fries. The group I was dining with all seemed to enjoy their meals but I just picked at mine. I wasn&#39;t hungry to start with, but the food here just turned me off. Nothing to get excited about.

More people in jersey&#39;s than not (seriously). 

We sat at the bar and had good service. I must admit that the service would not bring me back. It would be the food and the atmosphere.  What the atmosphere would be on a normal night, I can&#39;t say. 

I had the steak and boom-boom shrimp. I had never eaten boom-boom shrimp before, but it looked really good. It was. It made a great combination with the steak.  I don&#39;t know how to describe the sauce. it was spicy, but more of a creamy sauce. That against the crispy shrimp was so good. The steak was certainly good to sop up the boom-boom sauce."

Seafood pasta was okay but a little watery and the macaroni noodles were a kind of sad. Ambiance and overall setting was comfortable.

Our server asked us if we wanted them layered, you know - instead of all the toppings on top, making your chips soggy, and having nothing but chips at the bottom.  We agreed to layered...so the large chunks of chicken were layered in between the chips.  I seriously wish more places did that.  Apparently times have changed with the chicken nachos...they don&#39;t offer that option, at least they didn&#39;t my visit there this past week, but they&#39;re still huge...and good.

I&#39;ve never had a horrible experience here...the parking lot can get a little packed, but this place is pretty big inside.  There are food and drink specials every day of the week, and overall just your typical sports bar.

I was pleasantly surprised. The menu was varied and quite reasonably priced. 

I had fish tacos and my companion had the chicken pasta. Both dishes were somewhat spicy, a plus for me. The service was very good (our server was Jackie) and the portions were generous. 

I like this place, plenty of ambiance, good food, huge parking lot. All the important things, right?"

Re: zingers, pfft... I don&#39;t know what the hype about them is. Was NOT impressed with the taste nor the portion. (even when I got them comp&#39;d I was still not impressed) LOL

however, the following dinners, have been tasty - the prime rib (on Thurs), the 1 1/4 lb slab of ribs (on Mon) and the Fish Fry LUNCH for $5.99 

We&#39;ve been there a handful of times, and ordered take out even more, and even when they&#39;d screwed up an order, the Manager tried to make it right. GREAT JOB on management&#39;s part. The servers are mostly friendly, although a few behave like air-heads.

I am an Organizer on Meetup and have scheduled a couple of outing events there and all the members in my party said they had a great time. We got seated together in a large group on the enclosed patio and they brought out our order (nearly) at the same time.

Nice job!"

To watch a Bears or Blackhawks game, this venue is tough to beat as far as the available views in every angle. When you reach down to take a sip of your drink or bite of your food, you&#39;ll still be able to see the game out of the side of your eye, and definitely hear everything that&#39;s happening. 

As other diners have mentioned, the menu is all over the board and it&#39;s not pretty. It&#39;s impossible to know what direction they&#39;re going in and what are their best efforts, if not decent efforts. I usually go with the fish or salads, as this place is popular all over the State of FL, for just that, but I&#39;m still not certain that&#39;s the best way to go. Our table had a bit of this and that, most of which were their supposed specialties. 

The seafood combo was huge in portion and decent in flavor, and fortunately, lightly fried. The shrimp are a medium size, but are meaty and there&#39;s enough of them to be eating shrimp and not some fry mixture. Same for the fish fillet and fried clams, which were very good. With a baked potato and side salad, the meal feels less like a plate of greasy fried junk and more like a normal restaurant meal that&#39;s partially fried. 

If you like ice cream in a pie, Captain Jacks was everything expected and then some. The slice is large enough to serve 4. 

Service by Shawn E. was the way service should be at all bar restaurants. He went out of his way to bring anything and everything we asked for, from condiment take home lids to extra ice, drink refills, water, etc. He was friendly and deserved the nice tip he received. The manager came by on 3 occasions to make sure everything was hunky dory, so I&#39;m assuming management wants the establishment to run smoothly."

I was surprisingly disappointed with my experience at a restaurant that I usually enjoy. While there, I cut my finger on one of their stools. When asked if I could have a bandage, the waitress said that she could not offer me one because restaurant policy stated that offering a customer a bandage would claim fault of the injury. Due to this, I was forced to wrap my finger with a napkin which was not only irritating for the remainder of the night but unsanitary as well.

Sure it&#39;s an awesome place to watch a game. Lots of TV&#39;s and great drink specials.

Where do you get that chicken?  At a swap meet?  What is it, Grade F per FDA standards?  Taco Bell rejects?  

They can&#39;t even really serve a decent burger. 

I&#39;ve tried eight or ten things. Asked the servers what their favorites are (none of whom seem overly in love with anything) and everything has been average to poor.

My buddy loves this place, but I really don&#39;t know what the appeal is. Miller&#39;s Ale House is your typical run of the mill sports bar with a bigger menu. 
The place is big, and always busy when we tend to go. The walls are lined with TVs everywhere, so it&#39;s a great spot to watch the game. Their beer menu isn&#39;t as big or as nice as one would expect it to be. They have your typical Miller, Bud, and other domestic drafts plus a couple of craft brews that they switch out from time to time. They always have a drink special and they aren&#39;t bad. Last night, we got a pitcher of diesel (Budweiser) for $4 bucks. Can&#39;t really beat that. 
The food, this menu is a complete cluster fuck. They have seafood options, burgers, Asian, and Mexican. Honestly, I think this is where they hurt themselves. There is such a wide variety and too many options that it is a little overwhelming with what you want to get. Plus, when you are dipping your hand in that many ethnic pots, it&#39;s bound to turn up a disaster. Luckily, everything I&#39;ve gotten, although safe orders, like the chicken sandwich, or the 35 shrimp plate, have been pretty good. The fries are your standard freezer to plate, which is disappointing. It&#39;s not that difficult to make fries in house! My buddy always gets something seafood and he always is satisfied, then again, he is a human garbage disposal and will eat anything. 
Overall the place is nothing wow, but it isn&#39;t a bad place to go to either. If you&#39;re around the area and wanna catch a the game with a brew and some grub, this place will be just fine."

I found that the servers were all over us...which is better than the alternative, but it was &#34;Office Space w/ the flair&#34; obnoxious. 

The $11 full-slab Monday special was delicious. These were as good of ribs as even $15 could buy. 

Now the seafood combo was a grotesque platter of cold fried foods. I&#39;m not even sure the scallops were truly scallops. Actually, I doubt they were. They were much too flaky and large. 


Note to businesses: Please don&#39;t keep my running tab on the counter in front of my nose. I know I&#39;m spending money and I know I&#39;ll eventually have to pay a bill. What I don&#39;t appreciate is staring at my bill laying in front of me all night. It offends me

What I do appreciate is paying fair market value for good food and good drinks. You had just over half of that right. 

Bottom line is if this place only sold cheap ribs and beer, I&#39;d bump it up a star"

We had a great time, but the service was less than awesome. I had a hard time ordering beers and when they did come over, someone who was not out server was auctioning them off. We had a lot of people, so I understand it was not an easy party to serve, but it seemed like she should have asked for help. We ended up ordering with half full drinks so we could have it within the hour. A lot of people ordered nachos and they looked great. I shared mini burgers and wish I would have ordered nachos. No delicious. 

I would head back for a party like that because it is all about the company. But, I will not suggest this place for a meal or to grab a drink any time soon."

I usually avoid chains. We had 2 appetizers: onion rings and guacamole. The onion rings were really good, The guac was poor. Tasted like a mix. That&#39;s what you get ordering guac when you aren&#39;t in a Mexican joint. The chips for it were good, albeit multicolored, and the salsa on the side was good but had no heat whatsoever. I thought the &#34;craft&#34; beer selection was poor: not  a single Belgian ale nor other strong beer. They did have Blue Moon on tap, so that&#39;s what I had. Blue Moon, although made by Coors(yuck-have water instead), is pretty good, especially on tap. We had a group of 5 and 3 had various different burgers, all of which were cooked as ordered and decent. Fries were good, hot, crisp mostly. 2 of us had the fish sandwich with grouper: 1 chargrilled, 1 blackened. Both were excellent. Rare to find grouper in Illinois! I loved it. The server was pleasant and attentive, although the place was crowded. Tells me they know how to staff here.

This was really disappointing, we go to this location several times a month and have never been treated this poorly.  I did feel bad for our server but she could have at least brought my garden salad..  We will probably never go back.

There were maybe 10 tables at most that were occupied. After being greeted by the hostess, she stated it would take 5 minutes to put some tables together which I thought was oddly strange since there were already tables big enough to accommodate a party of 7. 

After taking all our orders, we began conversing and then my fiance said she felt cold. We looked around and saw people with their sweaters and jackets on. I was thinking that this can&#39;t be right being that it is July.  We noticed that the ceiling fans were on full blast so we kindly asked our waitress if they would be able to turn it off or at least lower it. She first told us that they can&#39;t control it and that it was fully automatic. I told her that&#39;s impossible and she said she would go check with the manager. 

10 minutes have gone by and she has not gotten back to us with an answer so we proceeded to ask the hostess. She said she would ask the manager as well and get back to us. Another 10 minutes and nothing. Another waitress came by to check on us and I asked her for the 3rd time to get back to me regarding the fans. She was finally able to give us an answer saying that they lowered it and that we should feel much better soon. This was false. 

Our food took about an hour to come to us, well at least the first half of it, and it was luke warm. We decided that we are just going to chow down as fast as we could and get out of there. 

We have visited buffalo wild wings many times in the past and don&#39;t get me wrong, the food is usually on point but the service at this location was not."

There&#39;s a reason restaurant are franchised because no matter where you eat it, the flavor and taste is always the same.  

Sauce on the side is the way to do it, so when you pack it to go, the wings will not be soggy.  You can also get 2 or 3 more additional sauces on the side depending on who&#39;s serving you. 

Today, I got the medium, parmesan cheese, honey mustard and thai curry sauce. My favorites are still the medium and parmesan cheese.  The medium has perfect amount of heat and kick to you that you can still you still taste the flavor of the wing, the sauce, and when it&#39; combined together.  The parmesan cheese is very nutty flavor which goes well with the wings.  

The thai curry sauce tastes great by itself, but when it&#39;s on the wing... it tastes weird.  The American Asian fusion just doesn&#39;t work for me.  As for the honey mustard, the sauce is a little too sweet for me.  It&#39;s almost like a sweet and sour sauce that&#39;s hello than honey mustard sauce.  There was definitely no mustard flavor in that. 

This location is also greatly located on the West of 75th, so it&#39;s near a lot of other shops.  You can eat wings then go shop out the wings calories or go work out the appetite first before you golf down the wings.  


Tip: $0.65 per wing on Tuesday!  This is the day you come and get winged out"

For starters, half the time I go in there they ate BLASTING rap music.   Like the chief keep garbage kind.   Instant headache.   I had to complain to get it turned down if they wouldn&#39;t change it. Why are little kids controlling the music.   And I&#39;m in Naperville because I don&#39;t want to feel like I&#39;m in Englewood.   

The wings keep getting smaller and smaller,  and they don&#39;t even cover them with sauce.   Buffalo wings and rings comes standard in a nice China bowl,  soaked in sauce, and has a pool of sauce underneath.   And that&#39;s not even asking for them wet! 

They took away jammin jalapeño,  my favorite sauce, so now I can&#39;t even enjoy the taste of my dry wings. 

Also,  some servers are great, but most will forgery about your order and not bring drinks,  especially not in a timely manner.

Our waiter was great. He was very attentive and professional. He took our order, got it all right the first time, and brought our food out in no time. The food itself was good as well.

A young man kept coming in and out, taking care of other tables, but never greeting me at my table.  I noticed he recognized I was there, but he never came over.  This goes on for twenty-five minutes until I really wanted a drink and I called him over.

After I attained his attention he took care of me decently but nothing great.  He even recommended a beer I really wanted to try, but they were out of this draft.  Then it took for me to get up and find him to pay my bill.  If this location has walk outs, maybe it&#39;s not the people but the fact that they get tired of sitting around waiting.

Overall as I said before, I do like Buffalo Wild Wings and will be going back."

It&#39;s either Tuesdays or Wednesdays that it&#39;s kids night.  And there are a ton of yappy little kids making a mess at some build your own sundae bar.  It&#39;s ridiculous.  I don&#39;t understand why sundaes are being made in a restaurant that serves primarily wings and beer.  

Because of the families coming in droves with their overprivledged, bratty and sticky children, the real adults flock to the bar area.  As a result, the bar area gets crowded fast even on weeknights when there isn&#39;t a popular sports event happening.

I haven&#39;t had a problem with the service or food here.  In fact, I love Buffalo Wild Wings.  But if you want to avoid the Chuck E Cheese atmosphere, drive to Warrenville or Plainfield.  Both of those locations are 10 minutes to the north or south.  It&#39;s well worth the extra travel time.

Maybe take-out for lunch or dinner."

It&#39;s almost as if to say to the customer, &#34;see, it&#39;s correct and we didn&#39;t make a mistake in your order.&#34; I&#39;ve been to restaurants all over the US and only BWW has their cashiers pull your order apart."

This new location is always packed busy and right by my work. I think all though the servers are friendly, they are young and not well trained (sorry!) not that I am this huge expert about waitressing but I do like for people to keep their words!

I work right by this place so for my hour lunch break I told the waiter we have to leave at 1:50 p.m, so we can make it back to work at 2 --he said we would have our food soon. We got our food at 1:35. Promise we only got wings and fries, nothing complicated and it was not busy there! The food was AMAZING! Even though I scarfed it. 

At the end, I will return like I did on Tuesday night for 60 cent wings. You can watch a game, chill with friends, and stay as long as you wan&#39;t. You can never really go wrong with BWW.

I&#39;m perfectly willing to listen to any reasonable explanation that gets thrown my way, but until then, I just cannot wrap my head around the issue.

I *do* know, however, that they have 1/2 price wings on Tuesdays.  I also have sampled more than a few of the flavors and have come to love spicy garlic flavored wings above all else.  The flavor is like a classic buffalo spice with a little extra somethin-somethin.

It&#39;s a good place to go during meaningful sports events, as well.  I was here for a couple of NFL playoff games and it was just great to be surrounded by like-minded football fans while consuming chicken wings like a savage."

The food is good, it&#39;s basically hot wings and different types of potatoes to go with those wings.  The only odd thing is that even though this is a sit down restaurant with table service, they serve all of the food in what are basically fast food containers.  I&#39;m sure they save money by not having to do dishes, but it just seems odd.

I have too many OK experiences at BWW to justify a one star, but I&#39;ve had nothing but poor to mediocre experiences with this particular location.  Two occasions of an inattentive waitress, one of which involved us asking for water, her disappearing for twenty minutes, then reappearing in the bar talking to a table of guys for ten minutes, another ten talking to a coworker on the side of the dining room, and then came though and asked us &#34;if we needed anything else tonight.&#34;  &#34;Just the waters we asked for forty minutes ago and the check&#34; which elicited just an &#34;Oh&#34; out of her, and she set both on the table without saying a word to us.

At the bar I can never get anyone&#39;s attention unless I have my credit card on the counter.  Also, it would be nice to be able to grab two beers (I&#39;d settle for one) and wings and have it be under $20.  Spending $26 dollars for inattentive staff, not very filling (though delicious) wings, and two beers does not entice me to come back.

Now that I got my frustration out, I&#39;ll turn to the positive side.  It&#39;s a great setting to watch a major sports event, sorry cricket fans we just have to order that at home, and every time I&#39;ve gone with a party of 4 or more, everyone suddenly starts caring whether their services will get them a tip.  And there are a bunch of good waiters and bartenders that do a great job, but I have way too much experience with the ones who don&#39;t."

First they tried to squeeze 6 adults into a booth with a post taking up a third of the seat. We took it upon ourselves to move to the open booth next to it that did not have a post.
We ordered food and drinks-were celebrating friend&#39;s birthday. Service was mediocre, but they were busy. Halfway through a bbq chicken salad we were splitting my friend found a long, wirey multi-colored hair in it. We had to wait ten minutes for our waitress to show up to tell her. Needless to say we had lost our appetite. Then we waited expecting a manager to apologize. After another ten minutes my friend went looking for a manager. He was extremely rude and did not apologize. He said he took the salad off the bill what else did we want. We just wanted an apology and some acknowledgement. The manager was very rude and belittling. Then when we commented that the hair didn&#39;t look human, he said, &#34;No, it&#39;s the cook&#39;s hair. He has frosted tips.&#34; I guess this was supposed to make us feel better. Aren&#39;t they supposed to wear hairnets? My friend was very upset and walked away for a minute. When she went back up she got a new manager who was apologetic for both the hair and the previous manager&#39;s behavior. He even comped part of the bill.
Had they apologized from the beginning, we would still be disgusted, but things happen. It was the manager&#39;s behavior and the fact that he knew it was the chef&#39;s hair that made this a miserable experience. We will not be coming back here."

We were the only three humans there besides a table of young questionable Asian boys and a dirty middle age couple that can only be described as &#34;gross&#34;. The waitress, young and probably in college, approached us and was very polite. We ordered 3 tall beers and waited. and waited.... and waited.... and waited. Keep in mind what I said earlier, we were the only few people that society respects in the ENTIRE BAR. The waitress, maybe her name was Brittany, then proceeded to go talk to her other waitress friends. Then she did some other crap.... then she talked with someone. It took 10 grotesque minutes before we just decided to walk out. 
This is the last time I&#39;ll ever consider going here. Poor service, poor management. I send this location a letter occasionally to complain. Usually I get free gift cards that I hand out to the homeless."

But work very close so we went online then called our order in. Taken by someone who said they were new. Went to pick up order again paid $50 with someone new. Brought food to work. One order was wrong ordered off the net menu. Wanted Grilled chicken southwest wrap got crispy. Told when called that there was no grilled chicken. Werent you told that? This was told to me by 2 workers. I said no not informed. Then given manager who was just as rude. but said that they had what was ordered..Informed they were going thru change from franchise to corp. What does that as a customer got to do with me?  Not offered to get correct order. Will never go to a BWW again. . That makes a few of us. Food mediocre

I do so because my less than discerning 6 year old daughter loves the mac n cheese with smiley fries. Over the period of time I&#39;ve gone there, solo or with friends, the food and service are equally dodgy. Until today, I haven&#39;t felt compelled to say anything. Someone should, though.
2 - I brought my daughter and her two little friends. We asked to sit outside. We were escorted to a section, told &#34;you&#39;ve got to sit over here&#34; by &#34;Ryan&#34;. And there we remained for 15 minutes, not so much as a glance our direction. Worse yet, he was physically in the area, busily fussing with a broom and acting generally disinterested in his work.
3 - one of the other servers glances at me a couple times, sees us sitting there, menus set down. At some point, another guy walks up, just to greet us and let us know that drumroll............Ryan is our server and will be with us shortly.
4- another 10 minutes passes without a visit of any kind. I elect to get up and walk inside.
5- after helping ourselves to a booth, the guy (who previously glanced at us though did nothing), walks up and asks me &#34;didn&#39;t anyone come to see you out there?&#34;.

Pardon my petty remark at this point please, but WTF do you think is the answer to that question ? Yes, and I found his breath offensive ? We&#39;re SITTING in a new section...do the single digit math there, pal.

He eventually takes our order, delivers the food, carries on some personal conversation in the booth behind me (where the customers lobbed profanity around without regard for the kids) and settled up our bill. I get pissed at myself that I even go there anymore for any reason. Ya know, I DO work hard for my salary and $25 down the drain, adds up.

The biggest problem I had with my &#39;experience&#39; today...........the utter, galling lack of manners. The new server never approached a &#34;sorry about that&#34;....I&#39;m not a greedy person looking for freebies. Still, it&#39;d have been nice to even be offered the kids root beer at n/c, no ? Abysmal. Going to try to never darken their door again."

Let me be clear; the food is servicable but nothing special.  I was pleased, however, with the excellent service, the flexibility with respect to menu substitutions, and the fairly reasonable prices. Additionally, if you&#39;re a sports fan, the abundant big screen tvs, tuned into sports oriented programming can&#39;t be beat. Our waiter was extremely attentive and on the ball.  He readily substituted fruit for french fries, and he took the initiaitve when one of my cohorts asked him for the brand of ice cream that was being served-no one knew, so he went and looked in the freezer. Certainly not haute cuisine, but I&#39;ll go again"

Most of the wings are very good, a 4/5, the burgers are also good but can be try at times. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s up with the fries but we usually don&#39;t bother eating them because they taste like their left overs. In terms of the wait staff, I&#39;ve received attentive service and service where we saw our waitress only twice: when we gave our order and when we paid our bills (food was brought out by another server). My other gripe is that they charge you $0.50 for extra blue cheese when they only provide one container to begin with. 
I hate it when establishments literally &#39;nickel and dime&#39; their patrons. I&#39;d prefer the cost be added to the entree. If I didn&#39;t like the wings so much, I probably wouldn&#39;t bother. Get with the times and get rid of those ridiculous parking spaces for &#39;Fuel efficient cars only&#39; it&#39;s tacky and looks elitist!"

My friends and I went late one night and the service was beyond TERRIBLE. There was a table of 10 of us and they forgot to bring us all sauces. After what seemed like forever, we finally got a hold of our waitress (even though we were the only ones in the place). The entire staff was in the backing running around like a bunch of teenagers. They were putting ice cubes in each others shirts or something. Completely unprofessional. Our waitress apologized and agree to bring out the sauces. After another 20 minutes of waiting and watching the entire staff horseplaying, I asked to speak to the manager. He was RUDE and apathetic. This experience has ruined BBW for me.

Came here for a friends birthday- on a Saturday night- in Naperville- and wasn&#39;t annoyed at all!  That&#39;s what bumped this can up another star!  I mean I only heard LMFAO twice!  Anyone that hangs at a suburban bar where the music is controlled via jukebox knows, you brace yourself to hear &#34;Sexy and I know it&#34; at least 4 or 5 times- given you&#39;re at the bar for more than 3 hours.  Actually, I was in heaven musically because someone (other than me) put on some MGMT, Interpol, Florence and the Machine and other chunes!  Well played my friend, well played.

After all my searches for &#34;The Can&#34; were coming up nein, I was explained the nickname and figured out it was actually just a Pepe&#39;s.  Silly nicknames.  I already use &#34;The Can&#34; as a nickname for something else.  Good thing for the Pepe&#39;s Can, they are nothing alike.   

We arrived at about 9:50pm and the restaurant side was already closed but the bartender told us we could still get food it we placed and order quick.  We did and it was at the table just as quick as we sat down.  I wasn&#39;t expecting much because it is a Pepe&#39;s.  Their food resembles something that came out of my microwave on the occasion I had only Kraft singles, tortilla chips, and salsa as ingredients.  It sure is perfect to pair with a beer (Southern Tier IPA) and a bar stool.  The bartender was great and attentive all night as well.  AND we didn&#39;t have to fight for the pool table.  Def could see myself coming here again!  Perfect dive-y bar to hang with friends have a few beers.

The best part had to be the free basket o&#39; chips and carafe of salsa sitting in the back for all to enjoy.  I can take Kobayashi down at a chips and salsa competitive eating competition with my hands tied behind my back."

We started out with chips and salsa, which they call &#34;sauce&#34; and is essentially diluted tomato paste and onions. 

The service was poor. The server only showed up 3 times the entire meal, and when I asked if they had any type of cheese sauce for the chips he simply said &#34;no&#34; and walked away without any other options. 

The food was mediocre at best, and they of course got one of our orders incorrect. I could maybe cut this dump a break if the food was cheaper than other places, but it was just as expensive as the much, much better Las Palmas in the area. I would suggest avoiding this pit at all costs."

Otherwise, yuck. Everything had no taste! It was bland, the chips were bland, the salsa was runny...yuck! I had cheese enchiladas and two bites was enough for me. 

The place looks kinda grimy, the table across from us had 5 kids, three of which were running around like crazy, being loud and even stopped at our table a few times.

It was just a new place to try, and I&#39;m glad that I did, but I won&#39;t be returning."

This is actually one kickass dive bar.  It&#39;s got cheap beers, a pool table, golden tee, megatouch and some solid dart playing.  You&#39;ll find a lot of dart enthusiasts here on the weekends and they hold weekly tournaments on Thursdays, I believe.

Bathrooms:  One stall.  One urinal.  Both not the best and there&#39;s stains on the ceiling.  

We spent New Year&#39;s Eve here one year and it was unanimously decided it was the best NYE ever.  Literally, every single person in the bar was in such a delightful friendly mood.  They had free food out and even had a free toast along with those little plastic things you pull on and they shoot confetti out with a BANG!  

That&#39;s when IT happened...

My cousin Michael was so excited at the countdown that the second after &#34;1&#34; was chanted, he threw his arms out and pulled on that popper with all his might......directly into MY FACE.

My head was thrown back and to the left from the blast.  At that same unfortunate instant, my girlfriend threw her arms out and pulled with the same elated fury......POINT BLANK INTO MY NECK.

It was just like JFK all over again.

It&#39;s located in a strip mall next to a liquor store and when you walk in there are two doors to go into.

That was the right door and we were greeted by a sign that said seat yourself. It wasn&#39;t too busy for a Friday night and there were a lot of booths. Which are my favorite. Salsa was sad. Very sad. Tomato sauce, onions that were barely chopped and a little bit of cilantro. Not salsa. Service was kind of slow. They have two waiters doing the service which wasn&#39;t a bad idea because there were about 15 tables/booths but we were ignores at some point for a really long time. The food was OK.

I move to California for 6+ years and one of my favorite Mexican places suddenly tastes like cold dog feces? Ok, maybe not that bad, but it IS pretty bad. Chalk it up to my being exposed to &#34;authentic&#34; Mexican food over the greater part of the last decade, but however you slice it, Pepe&#39;s just does not measure up, and I will never be going back.

I feel bad about that though, because the service is great, and the staff is so nice and pleasant. I wonder if they realize that what they are serving to all the drunken gringos is a complete bastardization of their native cuisine?

I ordered two of my Mexican restaurant favorites, queso fundido to start, followed by a little mole chicken. The queso fundido was horrible. I can&#39;t remember exactly what it was, maybe the entire onion that had been diced into it, maybe the extremely runny and oily cheese slop filling the bowl, I dunno, the result was pretty stomach churning though. It didn&#39;t get much better when the mole came around. It was bland and weak at best. 

The best thing about Pepe&#39;s, and this one in particular because it is so small, is that while we were living in California, the state banned smoking in restaurants. At least this time while we were dining on subpar Mexican food, we weren&#39;t getting a complimentary side of lung cancer to go with it.

I HATE Domestics so I had Dos Equis, more than one actually. I was nervous about the refried beans-had asked if they were vegetarian and was told they were no longer fried in lard so I tried a bite but worried and did not eat them-good though. Spanish rice was quite good, all rice grains were separate which is nice. Ordered a Vegetarian Burrito Suiza-had one bite and brought the rest home. When I was eating it later I think I found a small piece of meat and gave it to my daughter to try-she said it was meat and she would know. At the Restaurant they found out it was one of my friends birthdays and brought out a free plate of buenelos covered in cinnamon sugar and covered with whipped cream and chocolate sauce. The other things eaten were a chicken chimichanga, Chiles rellenos, and three assorted tacos and of course my worrisome Burrito.

I think we had food there once... maybe some nachos or something. Don&#39;t go for the food though. Pepe&#39;s makes an excellent margarita, and pretty cheap too. Ask for their &#34;golden margarita&#34; (no salt).

The atmosphere is great. Are these people from Naperville? There&#39;s not a whiff of snootiness to be found. All ages hang out here from &#34;regulars&#34; to 20-somethings playing drunken darts. The juke box magically alternates between country and heavy metal. It&#39;s a place with a really positive vibe, ya know.

I&#39;ve never pulled up a stool at Pepe&#39;s and been disappointed. Once this chick came up to me at the bar and asked if I wanted to do it &#34;right here on the bar.&#34; Oh wait, that was my date, Kim39. ZING!
si... yow, bill

PS - Be careful... for whatever reason, Naperville&#39;s finest seem to love hanging out in the Pepe&#39;s parking lot. Waiting for Pepe&#39;s patrons? I don&#39;t know. I haven&#39;t seen that. But make sure you have your P&#39;s and Q&#39;s together before driving home... or get a ride. Of course, that&#39;s true in any case."

On one side is Pepe&#39;s, an average at best, chain Mexican restaurant with good margarita&#39;s.  On the other side is &#34;The Can&#34; short for cantina.  The Can is a great local bar/hangout with great drink specials, 50 cent pool on Sundays and Mondays.   Very friendly, non trendy, with a diverse age group.  Great place to watch sports.  My 4 stars is for the bar, not the restaurant."

Hell, it&#39;s been around  since the 70&#39;s.  And apparently with good reason.  If your looking for gourmet mexican food, don&#39;t patronize this, or any Pepe&#39;s.  You&#39;ll be disappointed.  But if your looking for reasonably priced, reasonably tasty mexican fare with attentive service, this is a good choice.  Additionally, you won&#39;t be scalped if you order a beer.  The interior is  much as you&#39;d expect; bright pastels, beer posters, and a few pinatas hanging from the ceiling-certainly less than memorable.  The staff is generous with the free chips and salsa, and its pretty good stuff.  I have one word of warning: if you have a coupon and you try to present it when paying your bill, it won&#39;t be accepted.  Apparently, they don&#39;t have the dexterity to deduct anything from your bill after it has been entered.  Present any coupons before ordering."

I got a chicken caprese panini and it was great!!! The waffle fries and tater tots were too crispy for my liking, but my friends loved them and said they were perfect.

Sangria was delicious! The nachos they give you as an appetizer have a nice spicy kick to them and I loved that too. 5 stars!!!"

To start, it&#39;s a location where there aren&#39;t a ton of options, so people that live near here are going to live it because everything else is further away.

Goods:  it&#39;s fairly new and clean.  Pretty large inside with a lot of seating.  Food sizes are big, and prices are good for the money.

So what&#39;s not to like.  I was fairly unimpressed with the food.  I got the burger, and it seems like it had a burger bath....not sure if anyone knows what that is.  They asked how I wanted it cooked, and I always say medium rare. It was well done, but that could also be from the burger bath.

Tried several other dishes and none of them were really all that good.  The shepherds pie was ok, but it was almost like it wasn&#39;t shepherds pie....their own take on it anyway.

If you live in the area, I say decent place, if not don&#39;t go out of your way"

I liked the look and feel of the place but the customer service was the worst.  The bartender hardly ever came back to us to ask if we needed more drinks. She&#39;d make eye contact but refused to acknowledge us. My sister and I kept to ourselves and in no way felt we needed to be disrespected in that manner. We noticed the bartender attended to others quickly and asked them if they needed anything. We arrived early so she knew where we were seated. There&#39;s no excuse for that.

Also we accidentally dropped a couple of glasses which prompted the bouncer to come around and question us like we were criminals. We proceeded to tell him it was an accident. He looked annoyed then cleaned up the mess. He wasn&#39;t doing anything anyway. It gave him something to do. Just saying. 

Also this so called bouncer was hanging around the slot machines for quite some time. He wasn&#39;t doing his job unless he was there to watch over the games. What a useless tool. 

I asked for our last shots and the bartender makes a comment and says &#34;are you going to drop it this time&#34;. She said she was kidding and she totally caught me off guard. I should have said &#34;are you going to provide better service&#34;. We felt pretty neglected in this place. I&#39;m not from aurora so I was excited to check out a local hot spot. Never again will I come back!"

I ordered a chocolate chip martini which was so delicious that I proceeded to have 2 more! My drink was amazing, the service was good, and lots of friendly people at the bar.

It took a long time to get a table but that was expected.  We killed time at the bar.  The drinks were good and a very good tap beer selection.

Hostess was great as I checked in on the progress of the table.

Once seated we had a good waitress named Kelli.  She was very attentive and on the spot.

As for the food- it was good.  I had a tasty chicken sandwich, the buffalo chix wrap was good and the wind were as well ( note- hot IS HOT!).

outside seating will be nice once weather improves.

I had the shepherd&#39;s pie which was filling and tasted great. My girlfriend had the chicken wings and she thought they were delicious. Prices were good. The inside is a cross between a wisconsin restaurant with a high class bar area which strangely works. There is a great selection of beers on tap and some good specials.

We&#39;ve been here 5-6 times since they opened. We&#39;ve experienced consistently good service and food. They provide chips and a spicy cheese dip complimentary. They have great specials throughout the week, we usually go on Wednesdays when kids eat free with adult purchase and domestic bottles are $1.50. Today I had the Tuscan chicken sandwich with fries and my husband had the spicy chicken sandwich, both were nice size portions and good.

When we arrived on a Friday night the parking lot was full and the restaurant was very busy.  Having said that, the place is spacious and laid out well. It caters to families but also has a very nice long roomy area at the bar with high tops. We went to the bar to have a drink while we had a brief wait for a table to open. Wait staff were very friendly and quick to take your order. One thing that I like was the fact it wasn&#39;t extremely loud with music or TV. You could easily have a normal conversation or choose to watch any number of TVs 

When we sat down at our table, our waitress Denise was very friendly and knowledgable. She gave us complimentary chips and queso while we reviewed the menu. She recommended the BBQ pork egg rolls and also the jalepeno poppers. Both were very good. All and all, great experience and wonderful service!  The prices were very reasonable especially considering the quality of the food. We have found our new go to spot!  Thanks!"

Located in western suburbia (Eola Road, south of Ogden), McBrides is a welcome treasure. We had Shepard&#39;s Pie (the best I&#39;ve had in the greater Chicago area), fish and chips (wife&#39;s favorite pub food), an order of bacon wrapped fried jalepeno poppers (4 to an order - and quite large), and the complimentary tortilla chips and queso dip.  All excellent and great, attentive, service from Jordan, our server. A bit of draft and craft beer for me and apple sangria and a bomb pop cocktail for my wife!

Great service very accommodating! I asked Lindsay since this is an Irish pub if they have waffle gravy fries. She never heard of it so I explained it and she was more than happy to have the cooks make it. They were solid like no other! Waffle fries with brown gravy and shredded cheese on top! It&#39;s always been one of my favorite Irish pub grub! Definitely ask for gravy waffle fries next time your in! You won&#39;t be disappointed! Spread the word of this great place!

It is right in our backyard.  The pretzel sticks were delicious.  It was just the two of us and we were expecting pretzels the size of a mozzarella stick, so we ordered the 6 piece instead of the 3.  We were pleasantly surprised when the waiter brought out the pretzel sticks that were more the length of Italian breadsticks.  We ended up taking 3 home and my daughter felt that they reheated well. I ordered the mango habanero wings with a side of waffle fries. They were large, juicy, flavorful and no overbearing heat.  My daughter had the buffalo chicken BLT.  She felt that the sandwich needed more buffalo sauce, otherwise she felt it was good.

We&#39;re ordering various items off the menu, so we&#39;ll see how the kitchen handles themselves.

Update in a little bit...

1. Fish and Chips; battered properly and not tasting like out of a frozen bag. Would order again.

2. Spicy Chicken sandwich; good overall although a tad messy. I&#39;d probably look for something else to try on menu.

3. Patty melt; totally eaten, enough said.

4. Pot roast sandwich....need to get feedback

I could&#39;ve settled with just the soup, it was so good. But I&#39;m glad I stayed for the full meal.

That&#39;s exactly what this place reminded me of and I&#39;m not saying that as a bad thing.  There is a bar area that is separated from the rest of the main dining area by a half wall.  The bar area is decent in size and has a few TV&#39;s on the walls and a juke box.  The music was good when we arrived, but then someone switched it over to country music and that kind of killed the vibe.  When I was there every single table was families with kids, so it is definitely a kid friendly place (they stayed out of the bar area).  They have an area in back with some games and stuff for the kids to play without disturbing everyone else.  They bring you chips and cheese sauce when you sit down, which I thought was a nice touch.  The food was reasonably priced and the beer menu was good with a lot of local craft beers in bottles and on tap.  The burger I had was good and my friends Reuben looked great as well.  The menu is pretty basic, with typical Irish pub grub and they do have a kids menu.  Our server was very friendly and efficient and the food came out quickly.

I liked them this way. The batter was good and not too heavy. The onion rings were good, but nothing to write home about. The nacho cheese and chips are pretty plain. I doubled the burger (a steal for around $10 with fries). It is ENORMOUS. It probably would have been better if it were a little more well done, but I normally prefer burgers medium rare to medium. The southwest burger tasted kind of funny. It&#39;s not bad, just not really what I was expecting. Overall, not bad."

Good selection of the beer brews and they run daily specials. Food was good, we are chicken eaters, and enjoyed buffalo chicken sandwich,  buffalo chicken salad  as well. Good place to visit with family.  I wish them success and hope they maintain this good service and quality of the food. Happy for the local residents as there wasn&#39;t a good local bar in the area till McBride came along. Keep up the good work."

I live right across the street and was super excited to see something FINALLY going into this spot that had been empty for years. We really don&#39;t have anything else in the area and this is stumbling distance for me - perfect!  My first visit was Monday Dec 21st at 8pm, meeting up with a girlfriend who also lives in the area.  It wasn&#39;t busy at all, with only about 5-6 tables filled. We were promptly seated and our orders taken. If anything, the waitress was a little too overzealous, stopping by our table nonstop. That said, I suppose I&#39;d prefer that over not stopping at all.  I ordered the ham and cheddar panini. It was huge, and came with a ton of fries. Lots of meat on it too! Only thing was that it came out cold, like it had been sitting on the counter a while. My girlfriend got the chicken caprese panini, which was also cold, and she said hers was soggy, because of the fresh mozzarella cheese, and a ton of it too.  Also, the menu said the paninis come on toasted herb focaccia bread, however they both came on just standard plain white bread.  My boyfriend stopped by about an hour later (9pm) to join us and was told he couldn&#39;t get food because the kitchen had closed. We were a little shocked by the early closing time, but whatever.  Since he was starving, he resorted to eating a few bites of my leftover cold panini.  Ten minutes later, our waitress returned and told us the kitchen was still open. She brought us back a menu and he then ordered a burger, which was tasty enough. Overall a decent visit. Nothing spectacular about it though.  Two of the beers/drinks we had ordered were unavailable.

Fast forward to yesterday, Dec 30th. I stopped by for a second visit with my boyfriend. We were both looking for food since we hadn&#39;t eaten dinner yet. The parking lot was PACKED. We got there around 8:55p, and as soon as we walked in, we saw that the place was hoppin! Awesome! Almost every table was taken and it was a much livelier atmosphere than our first visit. We stood at the front waiting to be seated. After 6-7 minutes we were taken to a table by who we assumed was the manager/owner (we had seen her on our first visit checking up on tables).  She handed us 2 menus and said our server would be right with us. Another 7-8 minutes go by - it&#39;s now 9:10ish - and our waitress shows up. She apologizes and says the kitchen is closed and we should have never been given menus to begin with. Ok, REALLY?! 
1) shouldn&#39;t the person seating us (especially if it&#39;s the manager) know that???  
2) if your bar/restaurant is THAT packed and it&#39;s the Holidays (a lot of ppl off work), wouldn&#39;t you make an effort to accommodate the crowd and keep the kitchen open (especially considering you stayed open later the previous week on a night that wasn&#39;t even busy?)  
3) was the kitchen really open later, and the waitress was uninformed?  
Either way, we were there for food, so we walked out and went elsewhere. I could tell the waitress felt horrible, but what could she do...

Not sure that we&#39;ll try a third time. I can handle minor issues, but to put up with spotty service just for average food? Meh..."

Oh, and they nickel and dime you if you want a bit more salsa for your tacos.  Really?!?  This really bothered me, and I didn&#39;t even eat the tacos.  But how cheap can you be?  Ok...

My hubs and I have been twice. The first time we ate in with my parents and our two year old son. It was 5:30 on a weeknight and not too busy yet. Sign said to seat yourselves but we were still greeted by staff and offered a larger table that was more accommodating for a high chair (which I was surprised they had; very family friendly). We liked the atmosphere. Minor separation between bar area and dining room but the noise didn&#39;t seem to carry over much. Lots of TVs. I could see this be THE place we watch Bears&#39; games in the future. Friendly crowd. We were waiting for my mom for some time and the waitress came to check in on us often. They offered us free chips and a queso dip which was DELICIOUS. Just the right amount of spice. I ordered the ribeye steak sandwich with tater tots and my mom ordered the same. She said hers was a little salty, but this is coming from the woman who orders fries without salt at every restaurant. I thought it was seasoned and cooked well. Overall great experience.

Second time was a Sunday night -20 wind chill. Who wants to go out if they don&#39;t have to? Was craving a burger badly and called mcbride&#39;s hoping they do take out. They do!!! So invited mom and dad over again and we ordered mcBride&#39;s takeout. Best burger I have had in a long time!!!  Seasoned so well and cooked just the way I liked it. Had the tater tots again. They give you tons and they reheat better than fries. My husband had the buffalo chicken wrap and liked it. My dad had the Shepherd&#39;s Pie and received RAVE reviews. He was surprised how much meat was in it and it wasn&#39;t just ground beef, but nice big chunks of beef. 

Best part is the service doing take out was incredible. A lot of pubs do take out grudgingly or not at all. They patched us over to a server who took our order and they told us 10-15 minutes. We got there and the food was ready and was nice and hot! We picked it up at the bar like they said and service was great. Prices are reasonable- 4 meals for $37.95 and everyone had leftovers.

We will be back! Only thing that would improve the experience is more decor at the dining area. There are a lot of TVs but still plenty of room for sports memorabilia or Irish artifacts. Place is still new, so that may come with time."

We went to McBrides (close to home)They got the ribeye sandwich which I also tried and it was delicious, but most importantly the server was personable.  She sat us and asked if we wanted complimentary chips and sausage queso. I even told her we were just ordering two dinners to go and she said take your time.

My husband really liked the Tuscan Chicken sandwich &amp; I enjoyed the flavorful burger.  A little undercooked but now I know how to order for next time.  Lava cake was fantastic!  By the time we left the place was packed and the staff was hard at work.  The 3rd visit was also an early Saturday dinner with our kids.  Once again, prompt service with a smile.  This time I had the Tuscan Chicken dinner (not sandwich) and the chicken was fantastic!  We were waited for the fresh baked cookie...  glad we did!

Yes, it&#39;s true the portions have shrunk, so you don&#39;t get as much bang for your buck, but keep in mind, the portions were SO huge to begin with, they&#39;re still plentiful! 

I&#39;m a pescatarian, for the most part, so I usually eat only the seafood items, but their food is absolutely amazing! Their CALDO DE CAMARONES is to die for. Outside of Grandma or Mom&#39;s caldo de camarones, this is the best I&#39;ve ever had! It&#39;s chock full of wonderful and hearty veggies, and they don&#39;t skimp out on the shrimp. The broth is so flavorful, and it&#39;s the perfect comfort food. 

Their fish tacos are absolutely amazing! The shrimp tacos are good, but the fish tacos are phenomenal. The fish is seasoned so well, you can&#39;t eat just one, even though it&#39;s a good portion. The shrimp tacos are well done as well.  The TOSTADA DE CEVICHE is so good - the ceviche had the perfect amount of acidity, with the jalapeños giving is just the right kick, and the little pieces of avocado pack just the right flavor into the whole thing. It&#39;s a thing of beauty!!! 

Lastly, my favorite item: ELOTES! This stuff is so good, I practically eat it 3-4 times a week. Made with sour cream versus mayo, it&#39;s lighter, more savory, and absolutely scrumptious. My partner has had the chicken enchiladas, and absolutely LOVES them, and I&#39;ve tasted their mole sauce, pretty darn good. All in all, I love this place!"

Try the verde (green) salsa.. has a bit of hot kick, but really enhances the food. I love to get a &#34;Mexican&#34; coke in the bottle while I wait for my order, there is something special drinking it out of that cold little bottle... the made in Mexico Coca-Cola seems to have a different flavor, which seems better than what is made in the US.

First thing you should know is that they have more food than any other Mexican place that I&#39;ve ever seen. I like to describe it as the Mexican equivalent of a Greek restaurant. Most of it is pretty good. You should definitely a variety of things on the menu. Back when I was a night owl, I would only ever get 2 things: either the nachos locos or a burrito.

The nachos locos are amazing, but be prepared for the chips to get soggy by the time you get to the bottom of it. On top of the chips is ground beef, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and some refried beans. I&#39;ve never been a huge fan of lettuce on nachos, but I make an exception for them here.

The burritos are, or rather used to be, huge. They&#39;re still really big, but they have definitely gone down in size. I like the burritos, but they&#39;re not my favorite. They&#39;re very often under seasoned and the lettuce is too finely chopped so it mushes up quickly. 

They also have a variety of weird stuff that you just don&#39;t find anywhere else: freshly squeezed orange juice, a machine that makes a variety of hot chocolate drinks, corn in a cup (which is a delicious mix of corn, mayonnaise, and parmesan cheese -- trust me it&#39;s good).

And it&#39;s reasonably priced and open late. That&#39;s what keeps me coming back for more."

Ohhhh I&#39;m sorry let me translate that in english., FU#$ING NASTY ASS FOOD!!! Why 2 stars might u ask?? Because I like the all you can drink horchata!! THATS IT!! Let me start by saying I live close by so I take the back route behind the restaurant, and what I found was NASTY!!! So I drove behind the place and standing next to the dumpster in his apron was the cook with other employees smoking.  I mean his apron was SUPER dirty and appearance was awful, standing next to the dumpster talking!! The only thing I kept asking myself was OH LORD does he at least take it off to use the bathroom??? Whatever I take my risk go in and order.  Place looks like crap but still take the risk and order.  Staff is super friendly, no complain there.  Now the menu has a good selection but maybe a little too much.  Too much can be bad, find a few good things and stick to that, but what do I know.  Back to my food, I ordered 2 steak tacos and one pastor taco (rice &amp; beans).  I literally was spitting out the chunks of fat on the steak, it was disgusting! My pastor taco was ok but I&#39;ve had better.  The rice had no flavor and the beans im pretty sure are from a can.  My husband ordered the steak burrito, he also said he has had better, he&#39;s not that picky (he&#39;ll eat about anything) lol so yeah I mean I haven&#39;t tried much but honestly I don&#39;t think I want to.  Mexican restaurants are every where, and if you suck the first time.... I&#39;m moving on!!!"

I remembered it being good...but really after alcohol what DOESNT taste good?   First off, maybe it was the time we came but I will call it unorganized chaos.    I needed to pay with my card and got the &#34;you dont have cash??&#34; question from the woman ringing us up.    

After awhile someone comes back with my card, I signed, and we waited.   And waited.    We see a take out bag on the counter that was picked up and put behind them in the warmer.   My husband assumed they were waiting on something else for the order.   So about 10 minutes go by my husband asks about the bag that apparently they never gave us bc they thought we hadnt paid yet.    They asked for the receipt...never got.    So for about 10 minutes we were waiting for our food that was just sitting there, with our one year old, oh yeah it then starts to pour outside.   Lovely.    Get home and my taco tortillas are so soggy it was so hard to eat.   No sour cream in the bag, hope I didnt pay for it....let me check my recei...oh thats right.   Never got one.

Lots of Hispanic families in here.  I sensed this was a good thing.  I could not believe how busy this place was at 7:00 p.m.

I ordered a chicken chimichanga suiza and some chips with a side of guacamole.  This was way too much food for one person, but I&#39;m not complaining.  I spent $12, and I ate more than 3/4 of the chimi and I have some chips and guacamole leftover.  The chimichanga wasn&#39;t as crispy as I&#39;d prefer, but I think it de-crisps a little when they melt the cheese.  The guacamole was good, but not Chipotle good.

The to-go service was slow.  If I wasn&#39;t as hungry as I was, feeling like my stomach was eating me from the inside out, I would&#39;ve been a little more patient.  

I noticed another customer being indecisive when ordering.  I overhead the manager/owner tell her, &#34;It&#39;s okay, if you don&#39;t like it, we will change it.&#34;  A few minutes later, the guy went over to her table to ask how she liked her food.  

Next time I&#39;ll try the horchata.  What was I thinking?"

This is our second time, where we discovered they will deliver in a certain radius from the store.....score!
My better half ordered a chorizo and egg burrito, three chicken tacos, and I got a veggie burrito. His chorizo and egg burrito was very good, and I know this because his burrito was misplaced in my labeled veggie burrito container. My burrito was missing one of the key ingredients, so I was rather disappointed. Finally, three tacos were ordered, but we only received ONE. One. The one we received was very good. 
We know this shop produces great food, and we spent extra to get it delivered. IF we go back, we will pick up the order. I only eat Mexican food every few months, so I was really looking forward to my dinner... But man, I&#39;m more disappointed than stoked due to the experience..."

I asked for mild stuff, as chilli peppers and me do not agree. However, I guess mild means bland to them. Everything tasted so bland and non-descript. The meat was tender, but under-seasoned. Not to mention they had run out of guacamole tonight, so I got a tiny bit on my burrito bowl. Their store is about 100 ft from a Mexican grocery store, which either a. sells avocados or b. guacamole.

After reading some reviews, I decided to come in and try this place myself. The people (staff) were very nice to deal with. The meal came out pretty quick. The baby burrito was good-sized and sour cream was an extra $.40. No problem. The place itself was clean. My order was done pretty quickly as well. So far, so good.

I ordered the chicken burrito. The size was decent. The ingredients (onions, lettuce, etc) were very fresh (and cold to give the hot-cold contrast). The sad thing for me is that the dressings were better than the meat. The meat was BLAND!!!! In fact, it tasted almost watery. It was almost like it was boiled and not seasoned. Heck, you can boil a chicken but still add some seasoning after the fact. It wasn&#39;t done here, at least on this visit. The hot sauce was OK. 

Not the worst, but there are better in Bolingbrook. Taco Diner, Bucho&#39;s &amp; Zacataco&#39;s come to mind. I haven&#39;t been to Racho Santa Fe since its reopening but if it was as good as I remember, I&#39;ll be back there as well. In my humble opinion, Loco doesn&#39;t measure up to the others burrito places Bolingbrook has to offer. I&#39;m not sure if this is privately/company ownerd or franchise so that may factor in."

Also their salsa&#39;s are made fresh, they have a milder red salsa and a hotter green tomatio based salsa.  In addition their Nacho&#39;s locos is out of this world using queso blanco instead of typicl Nacho cheese sauce.  Their sope&#39;s, enchildas, and ceviche tostada are amazing, also for real authenticity their menundo is a must try.

Unfortanetly, Bill O&#39;s comment is true, late at night their are a lot of blue collar drunk Mexicans that will give your date some unwanted attention.  May want to eat their in a group late at night, however, from 11am to 7pm I have never run into that problem."

My husband picked up the order and when we open it up at home the fajitas had no veggies!!! I called and complained and the manager stated it was the cashiers fault, she said I had a credit for next time just to give my name! Well I tried ordering the same dinner and gave my name and my name was no where to be found. The cashier transfer me to the person In charge and she said she couldn&#39;t do anything about it, that I had to call the next day when the manager I spoke to about my credit was their !! Which I believe was Lisa.That she wasn&#39;t authorized to give me the credit nor could no anything about it. Later I found out that the person I spoke to that said she could t do anything because she wasn&#39;t authorized  was actually the OWNER!! Wow!!! I was in shock to know that the owner could care less for the costumes that make her business run. Mind you I am pregnant and had the worst experience twice and the worst was speaking to the owner. If I was you I would think it twice before going their to eat.

Five dollars for a baby burrito that, for two dollars more, I could go to Chipotle and get a way better, bigger burrito. Also, when they ask you if you want avocado and sour cream, they don&#39;t tell you that its because they charge $1.50 extra. The horchata is good, but really, its rice water, sugar, and cinnamon. I can&#39;t speak for other locations, but the staff was very slow at this one too, and they charged us for an extra burrito and had severe difficulty refunding it.

I had come here to meet with Jacqueline B. for lunch and was greeted and seated straight away. It seemed as though they were short on staff because the nice lady who was apparently the hostess ended up also being our waitress. Either way, she was very sweet and accommodating. 

I really loved how concise and put together the menu was. I appreciated the fact that it didn&#39;t take me 12 minutes to flip through it all let alone decide on what to order. They had sandwiches, burgers, soups, salads, small plates, etc. I liked how the plates had their own flair to them as well. It wasn&#39;t JUST burger and fries or a house salad but more exciting added ingredients. It seemed...modern I guess you could say. 

The establishment itself seemed clean, fairly large and decorated in cool beer signage of sorts - mostly of local Chicago breweries which I think is pretty cool. They had booth seating, high-chair seating as well as long table high-chair seating for bigger groups. I bet this place would be a good time on the weekends.

I had ordered the lunch portion of the turkey B.L.T. (half sandwich) with the Mexican soup that accompanies it (you get a choice of salad, soup or fries). I was a bit confused of the word &#34;turkey&#34; for this particular sandwich. No where in the description of the dish was the word &#34;turkey&#34; except for the title. Jacqueline and I figured it was turkey bacon they used? We were wrong. Once I had gotten my B.L.T. I noticed it was just slices of turkey meat on top of the bacon, lettuce and tomato. I&#39;m not picky. I was hungry. The food was tasty and the lunch portion was just the right amount of food. The B.L.T. had a nice aioli mayo and that was definitely something that stood out to me when chowing down.

Overall, I would definitely come back to try out some appetizers and a dinner dish...perhaps a beer too! Warren&#39;s Ale House looks like it&#39;d be a good time at night but I was very pleased visiting during the day."

I love a good pub that offers a casual atmosphere, but also has an impressive menu to go along with it.

Service is always quick and the folks here are super friendly. If you come for lunch, it&#39;s usually pretty empty in there so it&#39;s a quiet, relaxing experience (great for a work meeting!). They offer a nice lunch menu which is basically just a shorter version of their dinner menu and the entrees are half the size which I appreciate it.

For starters, you have to try their Italian beef egg rolls which is one of the small plates on their dinner menu. They&#39;re to die for! The wings and crostinis are good small plate options as well. One of the times I was here I split a side of their bacon mac n cheese with a friend and it was amazing. A &#34;side&#34; is a funny way to describe this mac n cheese though... it&#39;s enough for a full meal! Definitely shareable or entree sized for one person IMO.

Most recently, I enjoyed their tacos for lunch. I had one of the carnitas tacos (braised pork, pico de gallo, cilantro, cabbage) and one of the chipotle chicken tinga tacos (braised chicken, avocado, cilantro, crème, queso) and they are both really good! A bit messy to eat, but delicious. I think I liked the chicken taco more though. The soup of the day was a Mexican soup so I got that as well (seemed fitting). This soup is uber-delicious! Too bad it&#39;s not always on their menu. I can&#39;t remember all that was in it, but there were tortilla strips, veggies, chorizo, and some other tasty things.

Of course Warren&#39;s has a full bar and they always seem to have specials and events going on. Bonus: they are big supporters of Toys for Tots!"

None of us had gotten lunch so we ordered some food and sat on the patio to enjoy the perfect weather.  I saw they had a pulled pork sandwich and I&#39;m always up for one of those.  I asked the server if the pork was fat and she promised it wasn&#39;t.  She said she&#39;s eaten it a few times and never had a problem.  She wasn&#39;t lying.  I order the sandwich and it was great.  Unfortunately because I seriously was working I couldn&#39;t wash it down with a beer, but I thoroughly enjoyed my lunch nonetheless.  

The place is big and has plenty of seating choices from the bar to the patio to an open room and a more private room. It&#39;s definitely a place I want to come back to so I can get the beer I missed at that lunch.

TIP: The parking in the square is frustrating.  You can only go one way (like a roundabout) so if you miss an opportunity to get a parking spot, good luck making it back to the spot before someone else gets it.  So don&#39;t bother with the square.  Go around the back of the bar and there is PLENTY of spaces.  AND they have an entrance in the back (that actually seems like the main entrance.)"

I also ate here with my family. We came on a Saturday night looking for something good to eat. Despite being the weekend, we were seated right away and the waitress promptly took our drink orders. We also ordered the warm potato chips as an appetizer. We got a mountain of potatoe chips  covered in shredded cheese. Highly addicting!

For the main course I had my usual - the basic cheeseburger. It comes with all the toppings you&#39;d expect: lettuce, tomato, onions, etc. It came with a mountain of french fries and a big pickle. Who doesn&#39;t love a big pickle?

Anyway, the food is your typical pub fare. Greasy and good! And they have a HUGE selection of beers. The prices are reasonable and there is ample parking. They have televisions all over, playing whatever sports happen to be on. Music plays in the background, but not too loud.

I&#39;d definitely recommend this place, especially if you&#39;re a beer aficionado. Great location and great place to eat."

Huge beer list so you certainly won&#39;t get bored with their brews.  While their food menu isn&#39;t huge they have a solid variety of offerings to choose from ranging from pub-grub (nachos, fried pickles, etc.) to more inspired selections (seared scallops, dates/goat cheese/arugula/balsamic, etc.).  I like that they had both small plates and entree options as well.

The Hubs &amp; I shared the Nachos with Beef Short Ribs meat added (they have a 3 different meats to choose from &amp; add in if you&#39;d like) and also split the Pulled Pork Bahn Mi sandwich.  The nachos were good - nothing spectacular &amp; probably a smaller mound than you would expect to get elsewhere, but tasty and still plenty for 2 to share.  The Pulled Pork Bahn Mi sandwich was delicious!  Great sauce with just a nice little kick of spice to it topped with an Asian-slaw and served on a good bun along with some fries.  They even split the sandwich &amp; fries in the kitchen for us and brought it out on two plates, which was a nice touch.  We polished it all off and sharing those 2 things along with a 22 oz. beer filled us up.

The service was friendly &amp; attentive.  It was Noon on a Saturday and they weren&#39;t really busy yet so I&#39;m not sure how the service is when they are busier.  All in all I think it&#39;s a nice addition for the neighborhood and a good choice to stop in for a bite if you are shopping in the area."

The place was a bit crowded, but they had room for two, so we were seated immediately. I ended up having to keep my coat on the whole time, because our table was by a window and the door, and it felt drafty, but overall it didn&#39;t really take away from my experience.

Our server, Isabel was really sweet and attentive. I loved this place&#39;s craft beer emphasis, and my guy was SUPER happy to find two of his really hard to find beers available for purchase. I was able to try a new coffee milk stout myself which was enjoyable.

Food here was good- I read reviews saying to get the Italian beef egg rolls. They were hot, loaded with beef and had good flavor. My mind wasn&#39;t blown overall- I had a fried cheesesteak sandwich from a different place which was really similar but better. I then continued on my unhealthy path and ordered a burger with bacon, pimento cheese, arugula and egg on it, and upgraded to truffle fries. The burger was a delicious mess. It was so juicy, the bottom bun started disintegrating! The flavors were really good together. I only ate half, and it actually tasted better on day two! The fries were plentiful, and the truffle oil adds a more &#34;mellow&#34; flavor, IMO which is good. But overall, I don&#39;t taste much of a difference on the fries, and probably wouldn&#39;t order them that way again ($2.50 upcharge!).

Overall, a very enjoyable experience here! If in the area again, I would definitely want to come back!"

The menu is gastropub fare that changes regularly but keeps several of the more popular items available. I really like their smoked salmon which is sometimes served with a mixed baby green salad and sometimes with a hearty bread and the usual accoutrements. Other stand outs: Italian beef egg rolls, pork banh mi sandwich, truffle fries, veal brat and all the beer. Serious beer menu happening with lots of locals represented like Two Brothers, Revolution, and 3F. Tons of tvs are around, there&#39;s outdoor seating, trivia nights, and live music on the weekend."

We showed up around 6pm on a busy Friday night and were greeted by two nice girls right when we walked in. We only waited about 10minutes before a high top opened up by the bar. Typically the high tops in the bar area are our favorite places to sit in a place like this, and Warren&#39;s was no different.

After we were seated, we probably waited 15minutes or so before our server came to greet us. This was concerning to say the least, however as soon as he showed up, he was super apologetic and promised us that our experience was going to be great. It was great to hear him apologize and promise us a wonderful experience, and he certainly delivered. 

I ordered a whiskey flight and my fiancé went with a cider beer. I really enjoyed all three of the whiskey&#39;s, however I can&#39;t remember exactly which ones I went with. I think it was something like $10 for the flight, and I thought that was a great deal.

For dinner, I was feeling extra childish if you will, so I went with the bacon grilled cheese. She went with either the chicken sandwich or the portobello melt, I don&#39;t remember which. However, we both REALLY enjoyed our meals. Our server obviously put our meals in with priority, because we literally had our food within 7minutes of ordering, it was crazy! The food was piping hot, which is my favorite, so that really made it great. 

Overall, even with the rocky start, our server really made a point to make sure we had an enjoyable experience and it turned out great. The restaurant is loud and seems to be decently sized. It&#39;s sort of plain looking inside, they have plenty of TV&#39;s, probably about 20 bar stools, and high tops surrounding the bar area. They also have plenty of booths and free standing tables throughout the restaurant. It&#39;s reasonably priced and the food seems to be prepared fresh. If you&#39;re looking for a casual night out and some comfort food, I&#39;d definitely recommend giving Warren&#39;s a try."

The food&#39;s alright but the service is atrocious. I&#39;m not sure if they were short staffed that night or if that&#39;s how it always is. 

Upon entering, we waited a few minutes for the hostess to show up. She was pleasant and showed us to a booth upon our request. We browsed the drink menu and waited for our waitress. I&#39;ve forgotten her name, but she showed up and took M&#39;s drink order while I decided upon mine. 

Ten minutes goes by and she comes back sans beer. Turns out they were out of the beer M ordered. He quickly chose a back up and again we waited. A few minutes later only my beer was brought out. We inquired as to whether his drink order was placed and the waitress assured us it was. 25 minutes after being seated, M finally received his beer, Surly Bender, which is canned. We waited 25 minutes for a canned beer!? At least he enjoyed it.

Waitress came back and we placed our food order: Italian Beef Egg Rolls for me and Crispy Dill Pickles and a Border Burger for M. The apps arrived in a timely manner and the burger followed shortly thereafter.
The egg rolls (4 pieces) were pretty darn good. They were just as you&#39;d imagine an Italian beef deep fried with giardiniera wrapped up in a wonton wrapper would be. The dill pickles (5 pieces) were alright. M enjoyed his burger, although the fries were  a bit overcooked (still edible) and the cook was a bit heavy handed with the black pepper, but not a deal breaker. 

I noticed the tables beside our booth that were seated after us received their drinks and meals much quicker than we did. Is booth seating no man&#39;s land these days? People seated in them tend to be forgotten, it seems. 

The atmosphere (on a Friday evening) is loud as expected so don&#39;t show up here for a cozy date night unless you want to shout across the table. I knew this going in so I&#39;m not knocking that. The food came out in a reasonable time and our check was in our hands before we could finish asking the waitress for it. The place looked pretty clean, at least from what I could tell. 

I might consider another try here, that is, if I can get past the drunken Wheatonites I was so eager to escape from five years ago. I kid, I kid. It&#39;s an alright place, I just think I&#39;m too old to tolerate lackadaisical service and average bar food anymore."

We walked in and there was no hostess, we waited a few minutes until we got approached and were taken to a booth. 
The menu had a good variety of options and it was nice to see that they had a brunch menu. I ordered the corn beef hash Benedict and a side of breakfast potatoes. 
My meal was so good! Plenty of beef, great flavor, the sauce did not disappoint. My potatoes were also very good, crispy in the outside and tender in the inside. My boyfriend ordered 2 appetizers for his meal, scallops and a salmon (lox) dish. He could not stop raving about how much lox he had on his plate. 
Overall we were extremely satisfied with our meals. My only complaint is that our server took way too long to come check on us. My boyfriend had finished his first dish and waited about 10 minutes until the server came back to check on us. The restaurant was not that busy so I am not sure where our server was. 
Other than that I was a happy camper. Will be back!"

I&#39;m always down to stop in for an order of the Italian Beef egg rolls or to enjoy a brewski or two. Their beer menu is really solid and always changing, so there&#39;s always a reason to pop in. I was happy to find that the 312 Cucumber Radler was here, but I was sad when we came in this week and it was gone. I did get to try a new sour beer though, which tasted a little bit like wine. 

I&#39;ve tried a little bit of everything on the food menu and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever tried anything I didn&#39;t love. If you&#39;re going for dessert, I highly recommend the fried PB&amp;J. It&#39;s reeses peanut butter cups on bread topped with raspberry syrup and ice cream.

The servers and hosts here are also really great. They&#39;ll be happy to make a food or drink recommendation and we always leave satisfied."

Our meal was quite expensive for two for lunch (they don&#39;t have a lunch menu, or least not on a weekend), and they charge $7 or $8 for an appetizer of &#34;homemade&#34; chips with a dipping sauce. It really was simply a plate full of what looks to be normal &#34;Ruffles&#34; style potato chips, and yes, they were made in-house. However, it was just too expensive for what you get. Doesn&#39;t help that they were half warm/half cold for being &#34;freshly&#34; made.

We didn&#39;t try any of the alcoholic beverages, but, $40 later for a pulled pork sandwich and order of fish tacos at $14 by itself was just too much. Pulled pork was very good, fish tacos were just &#34;ok&#34; (we&#39;ve had better).

Unfortunately, we won&#39;t return, but the atmosphere was decent and our server was attentive and friendly. I&#39;m sure others feel and will feel differently overall."

The food is very good, with a lot of variety.  I had a really hard time picking from the menu because there were so many delicious sounding choices.  The beer is also wonderful.  I had Off Color&#39;s Scurry on a nitro tap, which was delicious and unusual.  I will definitely be going back here!!"

The Grilled Cheese isn&#39;t like your Wonder Bread, American cheese, childhood sandwich.  Warren&#39;s is a slightly more grown-up version with four types of cheese (gouda, provolone, cheddar, and brie), and bacon.  The cheese is piled on, making for a melty, greasy sandwich.

I substituted the regular fries for truffle fries for $2 more.  The fries are shoestring style and had a balanced truffle and parmesan flavor.  My friend had a burger and kept raving about how fresh it tasted and the quality of meat.

Washed it all down with a 5 Rabbit Guava Paleta brew.  First time I&#39;ve seen that one; you&#39;ll need a moment to peruse the beer menu, there is a lot to choose from on tap and in bottles.

Our server was friendly, polite, and prompt.  During the week, it&#39;s quiet during the daytime hours, not sure if it gets busier at night.  There&#39;s plenty of seating with a variety of low tops, high tops, and bar stools.  Perfect for groups of all sizes."

I don&#39;t recall any bad experiences... and of course, I love me some beer with my meal.

I met a friend here for dinner and as I was pulling in the parking lot (there are two entrances to this place by the way) She told me &#34;I think this place is going to be a bust&#34;  It was a Sunday at about 4:50pm. I responded &#34;Why?&#34; She responded &#34;Well there are a few families in here, but pretty dead but the menu looks good&#34; My response &#34;I&#39;m ok with NOT crowded, and I agree the menu looks good, the place has good reviews, I&#39;m coming in&#34;

And so I walked in...
Not too busy, again it was 4:50 on a Sunday...the Bears were NOT playing.  It was a nice chill atmosphere.  It was also bright in there, some places are pretty dim... this place was not.  It&#39;s not like the place was dead, it was about 1/2 full...not bad at all.  The menu was of decent size...I had a hard time figuring out what beer I wanted, because I&#39;m not at all educated in the language of craft beer, the menu may as well be in Chinese.  Wine... I know, Beer... no.  They had some specials, but I wanted something better than Bud Lite.  Based on the descriptions I got a beer from Revolution Brewing... I liked it!  

As for food...Based on many reviews on here speaking of the Italian Beef Egg Rolls, we got those.  My friend had a burger, and I got the grilled cheese with bacon...I can grill up a grilled cheese but this just seemed yummy, and it was...the bacon was a nice touch.  We concluded our meal with the pretzel sundae...we weren&#39;t even sure what that consisted of.  It was a soft pretzel topped with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, and chocolate sauce.  Different...and a good sweet/salty combo.  

I like this place, I will definitely be back and I recommend it to anyone!"

The place spends much money on bar booths and the inside but the menu items one can taste is of poor quality. I like the bar and the fee craft offering it has but they should increase their beer choices and maybe cut back on what is pretty bad and average bar food. I had the brisket pork sandwich and found it tasteless and the French fries atrocious. You might be better off going with the cheap chips offer when ordering a meal. there are few quality bars though and the lace seems a bit more relaxed and unique compared to the corporate chains.

We arrived just a little after 5. Not too many people in the place at 5 on a Tuesday. We were seated immediately. Service was very good but a little too hovery at first. She&#39;d come by every 2 minutes to see if we knew what beers or food we wanted. The beer list is pretty big, 50+. Kelly ordered one beer which she&#39;s been dying to try....and they didn&#39;t have it. I tried an Ale Syndicate Unshadowed and it was very good.  We ordered the Italian beef egg rolls, grilled Brie, and smoked salmon.  They came out in 5-0 minutes. The Brie was very good. There wasn&#39;t enough salmon for the big pieces of rye that came with it, but it was very good  while it lasted.  The Italian beef egg rolls were tasty but took a while to cool down to eat them. Personally, I&#39;d have liked them much more if there wasn&#39;t any giardinera and more cheese.

I called 2 hours in advance to see if they could make a reservation for a large group (10 people). And they did! Two hours before we arrived is pretty great for dinnertime on a Friday night. When my husband and I arrived promptly at 5:30, they were willing to seat us and serve us right away. Our waitress was very friendly and very accommodating for a large group. She didn&#39;t seem displeased at all about having to split the bill 6 ways.

I couldn&#39;t decide on 2 different porters, and the waitress happily brought me a sample of each. To be honest, they were both delicious. I went with the Revolution, but I think I picked the other one for my second drink.  On a side note, I was surprised at how affordable it was when we received the bill. One of my beer choices was $4 and the other was $6! I was expecting more like $8 for each one.

I guess where they get you, is the entrees. I ordered the Veal Brats and my husband ordered the bacon grilled cheese sandwich. They were both priced at $14. My veal brats were amazing. Two brats arrived on top of roasted potatoes, and red cabbage with bacon bits. The brats were drizzled in spicy mustard and seriously the whole flavor profile was heavenly.  I would definitely order it again. It was priced reasonably at $14. 

My husband had the bacon grilled cheese. It came on sourdough bread and had about 4 cheeses on it. He said it was really just average, nothing he would be willing to pay $14 for again. It came with french fries, but they were the small skinny ones (like at Steak&amp;Shake). Meh. I&#39;m not a fan of the skinny ones. I tried one when they came out and they were room temperature and not terribly tasty. For an ale house, I would have expected maybe some sort of more substantial french fry.

A friend of mine had the fish tacos and she enjoyed them. I generally go for fish tacos at restaurants when I&#39;m not sure what to order. She said it wasn&#39;t anything she would rave about, but she enjoyed them nonetheless. 

Our bill ended up being $55 for 3 drinks and 2 entrees. I&#39;d like to go back, because of the food and drinks and will probably return when my bank account replenishes."

However, tonight was one of the worst experiences I&#39;ve had at a bar. Service is something that definitely needs improvement. The whole two hours there we never got our waters refilled even by having all four of our empty glasses at the edge of the table. It would take around ten minutes from when we&#39;d put a beer order in till we&#39;d receive our drinks. Each person who took our order or delivered our drinks was different. It seemed like we had four different servers. Even then we only got approached maybe every 25-30 min. The restaurant was only maybe a quarter full so you couldn&#39;t blame business. I&#39;ve gotten my food ordered and delivered in about half the time at restaurants 2-3 times as busy. Also I first ordered a 5oz pour of my beer. When my girlfriend ordered hers the server assumed that she wanted a 5oz as well instead of a full. 20 minutes later when she came back she corrected it and gave her a full. Then when we got the check we noticed the 5oz was on there along with the full, basically being charged for her mistake. That thankfully did get squared away in the end. 
It&#39;s a sad shame as this was a great place to come to get a good variety of beers. Now I guess we will just stick with World of Beer in Naperville instead."

A foodie girlfriend met me for dinner, so I thought this was the perfect time to try it! I&#39;ve been to the location of Warren&#39;s when it was Red Robin in another life. The weird thing about this place is that there are two entrances. If you&#39;ve ever been to Danada Square, Warren&#39;s is located in the circle on the north east side of Danada Square. The first entrance is on the inside of the circle, where most of the &#34;fronts&#34; of the stores are. Because of the unique location of the restaurant, there&#39;s also a &#34;back/front&#34; entrance on the outside of the circle. (confused yet?!?)

Either way, they opened up both entrances so it&#39;s very easy to figure out where the hostess stand is. Anywho, when I arrived, I was pleasantly surprised to find that Tuesdays are Trivia Days! I&#39;m a sucker for random trivia, so I was happy :) As I waited for my friend, I perused the drink menu and knew that I was going to enjoy my meal :) The first page had a list of 5 different types of mules (alcoholic drinks with a ginger beer base) that you could choose from! So exciting!! I tried the Dark and Stormy, which was delicious! It was a little on the sweet side, but still very good.

My girlfriend and I started with the short ribs poutine, on the recommendation of our waiter. They apparently change their menu seasonally, and he said to have the poutine since they were taking it off the menu in favor of lighter fare for the spring/summer season. Personally, I would have preferred the fries a little more on the crispy side, but it was delicious nonetheless! It wasn&#39;t soggy at all, which I find pretty common with poutines. I&#39;m not exactly sure if it was cheese curds or shredded cheese, but either way you could tell it was a high quality cheese that they used. The serving was HUGE.....something that four people could easily share. It is coming off the menu next week....so I can&#39;t wait to have it again in the fall/winter when it (should!) comes back!

For my meal, I decided on the Korean pork tacos. The tacos come in a set of four, with a large portion of cucumber-cilantro salad, a good balance of the soy sauce, ginger vinaigrette, and sriracha, and I added a slice of avocado for a little fat in the mixture. I loved the balance of acid and fat in the tacos, and it gave a rich flavor with not much &#34;rich&#34; food (no cheese or sour cream here!) The four tacos were definitely filling...I couldn&#39;t even finish!

The atmosphere of Warren&#39;s is great....a nice, friendly town pub that you could spend the night catching up with great friends! I&#39;ll definitely be back to try other things on the menu!"

To start, we ordered the highly-recommended Italian Beef Egg Rolls and the Truffle Fries.

Italian Beef Egg Rolls - Interesting concept and true-to-Chicago Italian Beef flavors, complete with hot/sweet peppers, melty cheese and a dipping sauce. It was a bit salty altogether but overall, the novelty of it in tandem with its tastiness earned it 4/5 stars.

Truffle Fries - Great! I would highly recommend getting these. They come fried and topped with parmesan and even though I think the parmesan flakes could have been a bit thinner, it was overall really good. It also comes with a lemon aioli that goes really well with it. 5/5

Crab and Lobster Roll - Not anything beyond what you&#39;d expect from a Crab and Lobster Roll. I wish they eased up on the celery because it was a bit more like a Celery, Crab and Lobster Roll, emphasis on the celery. It was also the most expensive, coming out to $16. 3/5

Border Burger - Probably my favorite of the two burgers we tried. It had pickled jalapeños, cheese, avocado and chipotle mayo. The meat was cooked to my liking (medium rare) and overall it was pretty good. It was served with a GIANT pile of fries. 4/5

Steak Burger - Came with an egg, arugula and bacon. Honestly, I wish there was something on the more acidic side to balance out the salinity of the burger. It was SO SALTY and RICH. If that&#39;s what you like, then you&#39;ll definitely like this, but for me it was just tooooo much. I like that there was a runny egg on it though, so that makes this burger a 3/5

Service was good! Our server (Beth?) checked up on us periodically and was efficient when we needed more condiments. 4/5"

They have an outstanding beer list.  I had a wonderful cask conditioned Breckenridge Vanilla Porter that was the perfect call on a chilly evening.
The food menu is not huge but well thought out.  Vegetarians will find a few items of interest.  I ordered the fish tacos and they were very good.  Four corn tacos with grilled tilapia and a delicious garnish.  This was definitely a cut above &#34;pub grub&#34;.

the beer menu was extensive enough to satisfy the snobbiest of beer snobs.
the food did not disappoint, I had a reuben with parmesan truffle fries, my son had a burger and my daughter had the shrimp tacos. my wife opted for the fish boil with mussels and scallops.
portions were pretty big, my reuben was very good and the truffle fries were delicious, my daughters shrimp tacos were accompanied with fresh vegetables and were served on mini tortillas. my wifes fish boil was good... but for lack of a better term was ciopinno and was pretty spicy. if youre not into spicy this item isnt for you.
The service was friendly and attentive. Our server was great... and took extra time with my 10 yr old son to make sure she got his order correct. She also seemed to show up at the right times for refills on drinks and brought some toast points for my wifes fish boil.

I was the crazy crafty-wannabe lady that made shirts for both my husband and myself. Yeah, if I&#39;m gonna go to one of these things, I gotta bring my A-game, right? 

Our large group was seated at a long table that extended from the entrance area back to the kitchen. These set-ups are not my favorite because you can&#39;t talk to anyone but who you are sitting next to. With that being said, there was plenty of space around one of the long sides of the table, so we were playing a bit of musical chairs to Grateful Dead (I&#39;ll explain later) throughout the night so we could mix up the company. 

Our server was a tall gentleman that was obviously a seasoned veteran of the establishment. Having never been here before, I definitely gave him a run for his money. I asked a lot of questions, requested his opinion and was my usual pain the ass. Shame on me for forgetting his name, but he was very good for serving our large group of around 20 and I think he had another table as well. We needed to eat before the fluids started flowing, so we picked out a few apps that sounded good and we were on our way. 

Ok, lets get started....
The Bavarian pretzel was delicious, but $6 for one soft pretzel was a little high on pricing but it was excellent. 

The Italian Beef egg rolls were amazeballs! Innovative + YUMMMMMMY!! I could go back for those alone.

I was really excited to try their Bacon Mac &amp; Cheese and found it to be very good. My hubby thoroughly enjoyed his burger and tore through it like it was his job!

Their specialty drinks were excellent!! A few of us ladies tried a special cocktail that reminded me a lot of a winter/holiday sangria type beverage with sliced apples, a cinnamon stick and booze that snuck up on you after the second one! And you better believe I used my fork to dig out those apples that had been soaking in booze for a half hour! 

They had a Grateful Dead tribute band come in a little later in the evening that totally changed the whole atmosphere which was fun!

Overall, it was a great night! I am open to returning to get a second opinion generate and I know several friends frequent, so I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be back again another time."

I&#39;ve got real weird dietary requirements which usually leave me drinking water and eating plain salads when I go out. (Which I&#39;m fine with, don&#39;t get me wrong.) It&#39;s actually kind of rare to find a place that&#39;s so accommodating in regards to substitutions on the menu.

Well I must say this place has become a spot where I would really consider becoming a regular.

First of all, this place had 15 pumpkin beers on draft. Seriously, I don&#39;t know 15 pumpkin beers even existed. Maybe a six beer flight of pumpkin beers would have been a good option. One of the beers I wanted wasn&#39;t available, so I had a few questions about some of the beers. Thankfully, our server was very knowledgeable and patient with me, which I certainly appreciate.

My friend and I started with the Italian beef egg rolls. Where have these been all my life?! The beef and Monterey jack were great together, the roll was crispy, and I liked dipping it in the jus. And of course, the giardiniera added another layer of great flavor. One of the best apps I&#39;ve had in a while.

My friend and I were going to split the pub house burger and Brazilian sandwich. Unfortunately, we got a chicken sandwich instead. They fixed it for us quickly and oh my gosh. This burger was so insanely good. Mushrooms, bacon, tomato, cheese curds, provolone, and beer braised onions. Along with house cut fries. The burger still held up well despite all the toppings. Despite the abundance of options in Chicagoland, this is one of the best burgers around. I&#39;m a huge fan of chimmichurri, so I was looking forward to the Brazilian sandwich with prime rib, tomatoes, and mozzarella. It tasted very fresh and light, but I don&#39;t think the combination of ingredients worked for me. Maybe this would have been better with chicken instead of beef.

I certainly enjoyed my experience and even though Warren&#39;s is a half hour from my house, I would certainly return."

After having our engagement dinner,  my fiancé, my friends, and I decided to meet here for post dinner drinks to continue our festivities.  We had a party of about 10 -12 people and were surprised by the amount of open tables available on a Saturday...which should have been my red flag.  There&#39;s a reason this place is dead on a Saturday night at 9pm. 

Where do I begin?  In a little over 2 hours,  I had one 5 oz beer that took 10 minutes to receive,  and two shots that came quickly because my friends ordered them directly from the bar. I wish I could tell you about the beer,  except I never ordered any because the waitress was constantly MIA. Both times my fiancé and I tried to track her down,  we saw her shoving chips and salsa into her mouth through the narrow window of space looking into the bar&#39;s kitchen. Ew.

The bartender apparently hated his job, or maybe just his customers.  Either way,  I have  never met a more unhappy, unhelpful individual.  When we asked him about the beers they serve,  he&#39;d only reply,  &#34;they&#39;re on the menu.&#34; The second time I went up to the bar,  he yelled at us to go back to the tables we were at.  I explained to him that we already cashed out because we weren&#39;t getting waited on.  

Later,  he simply refused to serve my fiancé and our friend because &#34;he wasn&#39;t confortable&#34; with them. What????

I&#39;m not sure why they were told this,  but it honestly ruined my night. I&#39;ve never felt so confused. We weren&#39;t loud, drunk (it was impossible with the lack of service), or obnoxious.  We were well dressed having come from dinner. I could understand telling that to a bunch of 20 year olds in offensive shirts with fake ids, but we  were a group of 30 somethings in suits and dresses looking to celebrate my engagement! 
 My fiancé was embarrassed and felt he was harassed because of his passport, and made fun of because of  his accent. The whole situation put  a damper on our night and so we just paid and  left. 

After having left over  $140 dollar tip at dinner before coming here,  I&#39;ve got to say you people blew it. We had a real reason to celebrate. We wanted drinks to buy and had money to spend, but  thanks to your bad attitude and lack of service you won&#39;t get a penny out of any of us in the future."

But this past Monday, I had a volunteering event in that weird circle of Danada hell, and a friend wanted to stop for a beer afterward. Since proximity rules, we came here.

The interior is nothing too exciting - the standard array of tall tables, short tables, and booths, all surrounding a dark wood bar at the center of the restaurant. They have a very impressive beer list, but since I&#39;ve been on a mad Steigl Radler kick this summer, I settled easily on that. They present it in an enormous Steigl glass (in most places, I&#39;ve been served it in a can - UPGRADE!) and it was perfectly delightful. Since &#34;let&#39;s stop for one beer!&#34; turned into uh, a lot more, I decided to have a wedge salad as well. I was a little nervous about the bleu cheese crumble / ranch dressing combo (why not bleu cheese dressing?! Doesn&#39;t it make sense?! Whyyyy???) but it worked! And despite it being 9 at night, the lettuce was fresh and crisp. I would definitely try more of their menu another time.

That space seems to have been several things over the past few years, but hopefully Warren Ale House sticks around, it&#39;s a refreshing break from the chain restaurants around here without deviating from your standard local pub vibe."

They have a wide selection of beers at average rates. I got a glass of cheap chardonnay for eight bucks with the glass less than a quarter full. Too little if you ask me.

Our table got dinner and I tried everyone&#39;s. The spinach salad was okay- it had blue cheese, pineapple, tomato, mandarin orange, and very little dressing. It came with bacon but I didn&#39;t have that. Honestly it was an odd combination and I didn&#39;t like it. The corn soup was super spicy, I couldn&#39;t even eat it. And the chicken/waffles had grilled chicken with a small portion of waffles. Not very good.

The drink menu rocks, and since I am the only vegetarian in a family of meat eaters, the diverse and tasty menu totally rules. Lately, though, the service has been abysmal. One Friday night we waited about 40 minutes for our food, and we only ordered one round of drinks, we were never asked if we wanted refills. Tonight, with the dining room only partially full, but the outside patio full to the brim, it seems they only have two servers for the entire place? We waited over 15 minutes for someone even to acknowledge us sitting at the table. We were just ready to leave! The host and hostess ended up delivering our drinks and food, they really need to get in the ball and hire more help, or regulars like ourselves will find another regular restaurant! My food tonight was cold, the fries were overlooked, and stale. I love the staff, I just wish there were more so they could serve us better! The issue is completely wig he management. I would love to write an updated review (with more stars) hopefully sometime soon!!!!"

Tucked in with some shops, it&#39;s a nice spot to stop in for a meal or a snack after some shopping in the area. 

I loved the interior, dark wooden fixtures with big windows. Cozy but bright for the lunch hours. I visited for Sack Lunch Sunday&#39;s lunch build and we had the private room off to the side where the group put together the sack lunches and enjoyed some community time. I have to give huge accolades to any establishment that supports a worthy cause. That&#39;s just awesome.

My son and I stayed to have lunch with some of the other volunteers and their families and we were led to some high top tables for seating. My son is toddler and we don&#39;t mind high top tables, It just means I have to stand next to the chair to make sure his squirmy self doesn&#39;t topple over. Imagine my surprise when our server said she could bring a booster/safety seat for him. How awesome is that! It was a great set up and my son was happy as day with his own &#34;big chair&#34;. 

The menu has a nice offering of small plates and bigger entrees. Their beer menu is pretty expansive too--great selections for every palate.  I spied Short Rib Poutine and also wanted to try the Italian Beef Egg Rolls my friend Jennifer S was raving about. 

The food and drinks came out promptly and piping hot. I loved the Beef Egg Rolls. Very crispy on the outside and full of flavorful Italian beef, a bit spicy from the giardinera; very tasty.  The Short Rib Poutine was a disappointment.  I am used to the delicious Poutine from Bad Happy in CHI and was expecting something similar but this just fell flat. The short rib was not tender and there wasn&#39;t enough gravy. It wasn&#39;t cheese curds either, it was more like a thin cheese sauce--I can&#39;t knock cheese sauce, because its, well Cheese. But I like having curds in poutine so this dish did not live up to my expectations. 

My son&#39;s grilled cheese was perfect. It was actually a sandwich and a half with tons of fries. Very well made--nice crisp on the outside, gooey cheese on the inside. 

Service as I mentioned earlier was wonderful. We had a group of 9 and she took great care of us."

We had a group of 8 and made a reservation and were seated right away.  The Blackhawks game was on and there were lots of people there to eat and watch the game, so it was pretty noisy.

Our waiter was not consistent and at the end of the evening we had to look for someone to bring us our check.  We would have had more beverages if he would have shown up.  No, we don&#39;t knock them back like some of the younger people there, but he should have checked with us.

The food was spotty.  The fish tacos were bland, the dressing on the house salad was hard to find, but the pork tacos and the pulled pork were good.  If you have dietary restrictions, like me, the choices are pretty scarce.  I had the house salad with the hard to find dressing.

We all met here just to catch up and were disappointed at the whole experience.  Next time we get together it won&#39;t be here."

We visited Warren&#39;s with a large group of friends for an ugly sweater party over the holiday season.  My hubby and I were a little late (and we brought a party crasher), so we weren&#39;t the best guests ever, but did we have a great time!  My BFF and her boyfriend were hosting this get-together and they chose Warren&#39;s as The Spot...it&#39;s fairly close to home and they are regulars here, so it was an easy decision on their part when it came to choosing a location.  

When we arrived, there was plenty of parking which was a nice surprise.  I was originally concerned that their location would leave us parking a mile away and hoofing it to the front door - but that was a non-issue on a Saturday night when they had a nice full house, so there was the first plus!  Our friends enjoy a good craft beer and so when I mentioned to my husband that Warren&#39;s has a wide variety, he was immediately in his element.  We were setup so that we could easily see and hear the band that started about half way through the evening (they were a ton of fun, btw!) and we had an awesome server.  We were a large group, we kept moving seats on him and were in and out all night.  But, he kept up with us, kept the drinks flowing, got the food out to us quickly and was overall a big plus that night!

Warren&#39;s was very clean.  No sticky floors or dirty silverware to contend with here.  I can&#39;t stand that sort of thing and, so yes, I found yet another reason to come back to frequent Warren&#39;s.

The food.  Have you tried their Italian Beef Egg Roll?  If not...consider this your slap on the hand!  Vegetarians aside, of course!  Just do it!!  It&#39;s such a fantastically simple idea that we should all be wondering why this isn&#39;t on menus everywhere.  I was quite the fan.  Plus their quesadillas were quite delightful.  I ended the evening with a peppermint ice cream brownie sundae.  A holiday treat for sure!  I just love that they have specials that change and this was one of those.  Finally, here&#39;s my shoutout to the truffle fries.  These suckers are my BFF&#39;s favorite item and since she&#39;s not a Yelper (I need to work on that...), I decided to make sure that these are noted as a top-notch menu item.  Appetizers start at $7 and they have one that runs up to $12 for a fancy cheese board.  Entrees start at $9 with most running in the $12-13 range and one item at the $20 mark.   Split a few apps, have a couple entrees and grab a drink for a reasonable cost at a non-chain establishment in the burbs.  Sounds like the perfect night out to me!

Owner, Jerry, and the whole crew at Warren&#39;s deserve some kudos.  I am quite the fan and I can hardly wait to head back to work my way through more of those menu items!"

Expect to have a sandwich that could feed a family.
Expect service that is fair, we we actually had to go back to the hostess stand and get it ourselves.

Oh yes, this is not a Ale House. It is in a strip mall type shopping area with some Televisions some booths and high tops. Yeah, this is minor, very minor, but an Ale House should look like a Ale House. If not, it is a grill.

Would I return, yes maybe, though the service needs some training. Being greeted as if I am doing you a favor, needing to retrieve the groups silverware myself, and having a table full of men sitting 10-15 minutes in a sparse restaurant before a hello does not help.

I&#39;m not a beer drinker like my husband so Kevin suggested a cider which I really enjoyed.  They have an extensive beer list for you beer lovers.  To start, we shared the Italian beef egg rolls, which was a unique twist of an Italian beef sandwich. Very yummy!  My husband had a tasty and juicy burger for his entree and I had a grilled cheese with bacon, an adult version of a classic kids&#39; sandwich.  Both were very good and served with thin seasoned fries. Throughout the meal, Kevin continually checked on us. He is one if the best servers I&#39;ve encountered in a long time.

Our waitress apparently disappeared after dropping off the check for a good 10, 15 minutes and then again after taking our credit card to pay for the meal.

Luckily, it turned into a really fun night.

The beer list is pretty good, and I ended up having some craft lager type beer that they had on tap. The waiter was super friendly and chatty, and recommended the italian beef egg rolls. Wowza, these were soooo good I&#39;ve been thinking about them ever since we left this place. We also both had their regular burger, but I had mine with a side salad with a white balsamic dressing instead of the fries. I don&#39;t know who raves about a side salad, but this one was darn good.  Both of our burgers were cooked right, but the egg rolls were the highlight of our meal.

They had Simpsons trivia going on that night, which we sucked at, but was still fun for the two rounds we played. Also loved that they had both regular and small glasses of beer. 

The place looked pretty new, but wish they would dim the lights a bit and decorate to make it feel more cozy."

Since it was during the week this year, why not?!  Costume contest and trivia both with prizes included!

They have a pretty extensive beer list which the boy was happy about.  The cider options were disappointing, but I&#39;m ok with the cheap stuff.  It was the food and the atmosphere that we were impressed with!

We started with the Duck Poutine which has tater tots instead of fries now... Who doesn&#39;t love tater tots, or duck, or poutine!  O. M. G! The duck confit and bacon (YES BACON too!) were great together with the tots! And there was this white cream sauce that brought the dish together with the cheese curds!  Yes it was special, no we&#39;re not sure what it was! ;)

The boy had the Grilled Cheese and Truffle Fries.  The mix of the cheeses, pesto, and bacon (MORE BACON!) made for a really great sammich!  The fries were awesome!  Not just the flavoring that was added to them, but the fries themselves were well made.

I had the Lamb Pot Pie... This is a little like and Irish person&#39;s dreams of Shepherd&#39;s Pie in an American Tradition!  Not many restaurants actually use lamb!  They made a tasty gravy that paired well with the mushrooms and beans!

Some of the items are a little high in price.  It&#39;s a gastropub.  They offer good craft beers and great food.  Even on a busy night such as Halloween with contests and craziness service was good!  This makes it all worth while!"

They have monthly featured craft beers on tap as well as bottles and cans.  It&#39;s a great variety without going overboard.  Then there is the food menu...small plates and appetizers, entrees, and sandwiches.   I did describe the menu as traditional pub fare taken to the next level.  It&#39;s not over the top truffles and foigras but modern takes on classic favorites.   Speaking of favorites, the Italian Beef Egg Rolls are the BOMB.  If they were to take those off the menu, I might not come back.

Yes, the menu is rather limited, but the quesadilla with cucumber salsa and chipotle crème and an Italian beef egg roll were two of the best appetizers I&#39;ve ever enjoyed. 4 of us split those and then debated who had the best entrée.

Yes, it&#39;s only one page, but it seems like it changes with the ingredients they get.  Either way, the food was good.  

The beer menu though?  THAT is where it&#39;s at.  The menu is about 4 pages long and is broken up into categories of beer styles (and has the gravity, ibu, and abv for you!).

The noise level, perhaps due to the acoustics of the place, was over-the-top loud and many people were yelling just to be heard across their tables.  The appearance of the place was rather drab.  If you are looking a noisy bar with a limited selection of good food, this is the place to go.  A would not agree with their website which says &#34;a place to have dinner with the family.&#34;"

-Italian Bean Dip w/ the most perfect, pillowy flatbread for dipping.

-Eggplant Lasagna
-Grilled Baby Octopus
-Black Pepper Shrimp
-Beef Medallions 
-Charred Broccolini

A colleague suggested we have dinner here and boy was it a grand slam. Our waiter, Brian, was fantastic on recommendations and on service. The manager/owner Anthony was fantastic. They have set the bar for a great experience. Service and food is #1.

We started with one of the Chef&#39;s specials (I think they call it a chef-playground), the Dates stuffed with Chorizo and wrapped in Bacon. Holy cow - they  do it better than all the Tapas places we have tried. 

We also got the Scallops and Cauliflower, one of two favorite dishes, a must try, and finally the Crispy Pork Belly (our favorite dish - God I want more). 

These were small plates but truly, they were entree sizes. Awesome flavor. We also split the mussels which we sooooo good and fresh.

This place is a class act. They had an awesome craft bourbon (only one - my only complaint) and a great array of wines by the glass. 

Their desserts are fantastic. They had a boudini that is to die for. This is one of my favorite places and I will be back. 

Thank you Anthony!"

Cooked pizza dough was hot and fresh but very plain so don&#39;t expect it to have any tomatoes as most pizza bread does. 

Paccheri bolognese was the bomb. So flavorful and creamy!

The chicken and pasta was a breaded chicken breast paillard with a garlicky sauce, fresh mozzarella, bruschetta tomatoes and arugula. A small portion of creamy spaghetti alfredo was a good counterpoint to the crispy chicken.

The pan roasted salmon was really underwhelming. Nice veg and saucy but it needed a lot more flavor."

I came in knowing I would review this place for you guys because I had a large party and tons of dishes would be ordered! 

   FYI: They do not take reservations but they let you call ahead and that puts your table ahead of any walk ins. So call ahead. Absolutely call. This place was RIDICULOUSLY BUSY for a Tuesday night. I called and they offered us a high top table. We arrived exactly when we said we would and only waited for a few minutes before we were greeted by the manager who offered us a booth instead of the table because she didn&#39;t want us waiting any longer. We actually preferred a booth because we didn&#39;t have to worry about kids playing on chairs! Speaking of kids -- I was afraid that mine would be too loud for this environment. The restaurant was full of diverse groups and even other children. It&#39;s kind of loud in general -- but not in an obnoxious way at all. They even provide a kids menu for the little ones.
 
      Heidi was our server. What a doll. Interacted with my kids, knew the menu, and was super informative. She never got an order wrong. We started with their special drink the cucumber sangria. Super summery feeling and fresh. Their alcohol selection in general was great. They can make pretty much anything you ask for. The table shared Zucchini Fries. They weren&#39;t greasy -- my kid thought they were French fries and ate them. The table tried everything from pastas, pizzas, calzones. It was all very large and VERY scrumptious! Everything tasted fresh too. We all agreed that their pizza dough was out of this world. Vodka sauce was done incredibly well. 

      We tried a ton of desserts. Gelato (offered in a ton of flavors), their Italian doughnuts offered with chocolate sauce for dipping, flourless chocolate cake that came with berry compote and a scoop of vanilla gelato, Nutella calzone which was huge!!! But it probably was the best dessert we had there. Nothing disappointed! 

       Thank you Fire + Wine for this lovely night out. Thank you Heidi for being so gracious -- you do a fantastic job and work incredibly hard! Props!

This review is overdue, as I went here for my birthday a couple of months back, but I&#39;m still thinking about the meal I had. I consider myself kind of a foodie, and I&#39;ve been to quite a number of restaurants with my fellow foodie boyfriend, and we had one of the best meals we&#39;ve ever had anywhere. Amazing arancini, perfectly cooked pork belly, and a butternut squash tortelloni with braised short rib that is possibly one of the best things I have ever put in my mouth. Holy YUM. The service has been phenomenal every time we&#39;ve gone here, they even managed to squeeze us in when my reservation was somehow lost last Valentine&#39;s Day when the place was jam packed! The prices are very reasonable for the quality of food. Appetizers, dinner, and a bottle of wine have been under $100 each time, and I have left there happier than when I&#39;ve left some restaurants where I&#39;ve paid double that. 

My only wish is that I lived a bit closer, but I&#39;d probably be in trouble if I did! I&#39;m lucky I&#39;m able to hop the Metra and take a jaunt on over whenever I feel like a fun date night, though.

While at the Taste of Glen Ellyn&#34; and seeing the absolutely abominable food choices they were offering (very sad) at the fest, just could not see eating anything the fest had to offer.

We happened to be strolling by Fire + Wine and decided now was the time to check it out.

Kind of crowded, kind of noisy, but I&#39;m OK with that.
Had their octopus small plate, house salad, and also a pizza with pancetta and arugula.
House salad was nice and fresh and interesting which is always a good start.
The octopus was fantastic. Grilled just perfectly and came with arugula, roasted potato slices, grape tomatoes and a sauce that had some heat and zip to it which encircled the plate.
We loved it. Was debating about placing another order of it but since our pizza was on it&#39;s way decided against it because it would be too much to eat.
The pizza was a wood burning type which had a nice crust and a good balance of toppings. I liked how the pancetta was crispy and in nice sized slices instead of how some places crumble it up. The bottom of the crust was a bit scorched but was still tasty so we ate it all.

Service was efficient and friendly. When the waiter checked up on us we told him about the crust and he was apologetic and said they could make a new one but it was not needed by us.

I am definitely going back here because they had quite a few menu items that I would like to try.
I am definitely going to get the octopus again because it was just great. If you like grilled octopus and like a little bit of heat with it, you have to try it.

Cheers to all"

Grilled romaine is always a favorite. And it was especially good tonight. We&#39;ve tried to make it at home and can&#39;t quite duplicate the deliciousness. 

Pancetta and arugula pizza was amazing. We&#39;ve had this at a variety of place and F+W is the winner. Crispy pancetta. Fresh arugula. And the surprising addition of cherry tomatoes for a touch of sweet. 

I also enjoyed my wine, the Franciscan Chardonnay in a generous pour.

This was my first time back  in Glen Ellyn since I lived there in the 1960s. If there were eateries back then, I don&#39;t remember a thing about them. Fire and Wine was so much fun. I had a unique Margarita made with lime and orange juice. We loved the fried mozzarella balls that were light and not greasy. Pasta with vodka sauce and a roasted caesar salad completed the meal! No room for dessert. Muchas gracias!"

My husband and I tried getting a table shortly after the show aired but the wait time was to long, we were really hungry.  Any-who....we finally got a chance tonight and I am so glad we did!  The atmosphere was welcoming, our waiter, Tyler, was helpful and knowledgeable when guiding us through the menu.  We settled on the Burrata as an appetizer, I had the Kale Salad, which was fantastic and my husband had the Meatball Pizza, just the right amount of heat in the meat.  Everything was packed with flavor and fresh. We shared the hot donuts for dessert.  I recommend Fire and Wine to anyone looking for good flavorful food, reasonable prices and on point service.   A shout out to Tyler for providing great service!"

We decided to have an early dinner and arrived at the restaurant around 4:30. At that time the restaurant was not busy, there was no wait and we got a great parking spot. 
As soon as we walked in we were greeted by two very friendly and energetic girls, they were both very pleasant. We got seated right away. 
The restaurant is nice and cozy, we were seated by the Windows which was nice and bright. The seating on the lower lever, main dining area is dark and romantic looking. 
Our sever, a very nice girl, explained the menu, told us their drink special and the dinner special. She went to get us water and we got to look over the menu. For my drink I went with a raspberry beer that was fantastic. I&#39;m not a wine person, but their wine list is impressive. Their beer selection was not bad either. We ordered the black pepper shrimp appetizer and that was fantastic. It had a spicy hint without being overly hot and it was served over polenta and there were some peppers thrown in the mix. My boyfriend and I enjoyed it very much. For my entree I got the seafood risotto. Scallops, shrimp, and clams in a delicious sauce mixed in with risotto. The server grated fresh Parmesan over it and it melted right in. The dish was very generous with the shrimp and the scallops were a nice size. My boyfriend got the hangar steak served with veggies. His dish was amazing. He ordered the steak medium and it was cooked to perfection and it was even charred a bit. He was blown away and so was I. The steak melted in your mouth. 
I was a fatty and ordered dessert, the flourless chocolate cake served with vanilla bean gelato and whip cream. The cake itself was not bad, a little too rich for my taste but the gelato was wonderful. 
We had a great experience, the food was amazing, the staff was great and the background music was awesome. 
By the time we left there was a lot of people waiting to be seated, the bar was packed and the restaurant was full. I recommend get there early or be prepared to wait."

Appetizers of aranchini and the homemade ricotta were delicious! If I come back I will probably just stick with small plates- I wasn&#39;t overly impressed with my Regina Margarita pizza (the cheese didn&#39;t taste like anything). No one else at my table had complaints about their entrees, though. Tiramisu for dessert was also quite good.
Overall, if I&#39;m looking for a nice night out with good drinks, I would come back here. Be sure to arrive early or be prepared to wait! They don&#39;t take reservations and won&#39;t seat you until your whole party arrives."

Some highlights:
Pancetta + Arugula Pizza 
Pomodoro Pie Pizza
Zucchini Fries
Vodka (when made right)
Italian Doughnuts (great for sharing)

They have some amazing food and are capable of making great dishes which is frustrating when you order and receive a poor dish. My latest experience was a take out, ordered 2 of the same dish and received 2 very different looking dishes (one looked like someone&#39;s leftovers and the other looked like it had all the sauce and no noodles). I figured it would be a good idea to inform the management of this and when I did I was told that they do not make mistakes (paraphrasing) but they&#39;d be willing to &#34;make it right&#34;. When you fail to acknowledge mistakes can be made you have lost me, at that point I lost interest in allowing them to &#34;make it right&#34;.  

Dining experiences have been mixed. The call ahead list would work better if they used it more like reservations and limited the amount for a specific time."

We were in West Chicago for a meeting and were looking for a new place to try for dinner that wasn&#39;t too far away. Found Fire + Wine on Yelp, and there is a reason why this place has so many 5 star ratings. 

1) Food is amazing. Seriously it is super good. (More on that in a moment)

2) Service is ON POINT. 
Not only was Lauren a rockstar, but the moment we had a dirty dish, it was cleared. Not obtrusive, but people were definitely paying attention.

3) They go out of their way to make you feel important. 
We mentioned it was our first time and Michael, one of the partners stopped by to see how our experience was going a little after the second small plate arrived. It was clear that he actually cared and wanted to ensure we had a great time. We also were torn between ordering the ricotta &amp; honeycomb or the pork belly, and they surprised us with the ricotta anyway so we could try it after we had ordered the pork belly. (Both were amazing) They also had this way of making us feel like every decision we made was the right one. (Michael commented on the bottle of wine we ordered, Lauren + food runners commented on dishes... it was a nice touch. Not manufactured)

Back to the food:
We started with the mussels &amp; crispy pork belly. (And then they brought the ricotta honeycomb anyway) Mussels were tasty but the broth was the star. Pork belly was more like a mini pork filet (not tiny chunks like many serve it), topped with a nice stone fruit compote. But the ricotta &amp; honeycomb... Wow. I can see why they didn&#39;t want us to miss out. I almost licked the plate. 

Then we split the Regina Margherita pizza. Crust was good, liked the buffalo mozz but not huge fans of the cherry tomatoes. Flavor was too tart &amp; they were not super easy to eat. 

Finished off with the panna cotta which was incredible. It had so many layers of flavor--sea salt, balsamic, and creamy vanilla bean. 

We also got the fresh rigatoni + sausage to go, but haven&#39;t had a chance to dive into that yet. If it&#39;s half as good as everything else, I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be incredible.

One final thing-- we live about 45 mins away but this won&#39;t deter us from coming as much as possible. Yes, it&#39;s that good."

It was a Friday night and packed so we waited over an hour, went across the street to have a drink. We ordered a few items to share and although the description was amazing, the dishes were ok, nothing spectacular or unique. Crispy pork belly, mussels in spicy broth, Parmesan zucchini fries, beet salad and for dessert we tried the flourless chocolate cake, very dry and disappointing. Our waiter was awesome tho so that&#39;s a plus. Maybe we ordered the wrong things. Next time I&#39;ll try entree and review again."

But this is one of the best places I&#39;ve had in terms of Italian food. 

Been here several times and never had a bad experience with anything. The pasta is delicious and the pizza is very good too. I like that you can choose to do the whole tapas experience or have your own meal. 

When you consider the quality of the food and the serving size, the price is really a bargain. 

The biggest downside is the fact that they don&#39;t take reservations and pretty much from 4:30 on, it can be a bit of a wait. However, you know that this is typically a good sign. 

You can wait at the bar, while waiting for a table to open up. They have a decent craft beer selection and a very expansive wine list."

Now I understand the need to visit Kuma&#39;s Corner, Giordano&#39;s, Lou Malnatis, and their similar ilk, but I just needed good, straight-forward dinner for myself and my corporate cohorts. The concierge at the front desk had a folder with all the usual fare that visiting aliens commonly endure, but I pulled her aside and asked for a decent recommendation aside from the Chinese MSG-fiasco or the Olive Garden BS that people resort to for comfort. A note to travelers: You are visiting a new place, try something that isn&#39;t in your area at home. You can have the endless salad at Olive Garden any Wednesday night in your local boring s***-hole of a town.

Anyway... This place is visually and atmospherically a hit when you walk in with a corner-pub-type feel, but with a warmer Italian flair. We were seated immediately, with a very attentive server helping the other people in our group decide where to gastronomically travel next. 

The food was well-done and well presented in a nice display of where their chef/kitchen can do, and the flavor was present to match the visual eye-candy. Even my table mates were commenting on the display and attention to detail that usually isn&#39;t present at this price-point. Being a pescatarian, I usually watch and gauge my reactions from their&#39;s if they order the meats, and those that ordered the meats gave the thumbs-up. My seafood and pasta dishes were as expected, but not the fifth star. The fifth star is reserved for experiences that are 103% beyond your expectations, so don&#39;t let the four star fool you here. It&#39;s worth the minuscule monies paid and the overall experience makes me want to visit the area again. The little town of Glen Ellyn is very quaint, but warm in the same breath.

I may not be back, but that isn&#39;t due to choice, but rather I must go where my work flows."

When we arrived, there were several women at the front hostess station, most of whom were nice and happy to greet is and seat is and one person who seemed a little mean/b*tchy to the rest of the greeters, but ok, whatever, right?

So we sit and have our dinner... A bunch of small plates. Some were very good (the sauce on the pizza, the ricotta and honey, the kale salad, scallops with cauliflower), some were only ok (particularly the desserts (especially the Italian doughnuts were not very good. Too thick, chewy in a kind of leathery kind of way.)). Our server was very nice.

As we wrapped up, one of the other servers bumped into one of the people in our party, getting marinara sauce on his sleeve, and then we had another run in with the not-nice lady from the front, this time in the bathroom. There was one of those &#34;caution/wet floor&#34; signs in front of the bathroom, so I entered carefully. Inside was the woman from the front with another worker. The woman looked at me and said in a really rude way &#34;Didn&#39;t you see the sign?&#34; and opened the door to show me just how stupid I was. I told her that I had seen the sign and it said that the floor was wet not that it was closed. Another front staff person came in at the moment and said that they just needed a moment and that the restroom was closed in a perfectly reasonable manner. Thinking that maybe it was only me, I related the story to the table when I returned and they all had already noted her behavior at the beginning that they knew who I was referring to. To start and end the experience with that cemented the 3 stars. Would have said 2, but that would just have been vindictive and would have unfairly penalized the good parts. Disappointing."

I told her I wanted a vodka drink to celebrate my awesomeness of being old and she hooked me up with a fantastic lemon ditty. 

Food. Lord. I can&#39;t even. I&#39;ll keep this as short as possible or i will go on and on and on.

Ricotta, honeycomb ridiculous. I mean come on. This shit is so good it will make you cry. I&#39;m salivating.

Aranchini. Fried balls of cheesy rice goodness. Are you kidding me? And the onions on top? There&#39;s six. The less people there, the less you have to share. 

Black pepper shrimp. Delicious. Sauce was on point but it tasted slightly burnt. Will for sure try again.

Meatballs. Lord. They&#39;re the good meatballs. The ones with love and meat. Sauce is amazing. 

Mussels were plentiful. I could eat toast points and this broth everyday.

Kale salad for the vegan child. Filled with goodness. She devoured it. 

Quinoa and vegetables. The BF said vegetables shouldn&#39;t taste this good. He never ever eats them. Amazing.

Birthday panna cotta. Ugh. I had no room. I made room. Good. So good.

Service with Heidi with on point. Other servers and bussers were swift and unobtrusive. Seriously amazing.

I was wrong.

We went early and didn&#39;t have to wait long (you can call ahead and get on the list) We actually went with a good attitude, we got there at 5:00 on a Saturday and they said it would be about 1-1.5 hours, we were there, we were committed and we were ready.

They sat us in 15 minutes.

Am I alone in wanting to break out in the James Taylor song &#34;Fire and Rain&#34; every time I hear the name of this place? (I&#39;m doing it now)

So, it&#39;s Italian (in case you didn&#39;t know) The wood fired Pizza&#39;s are good.. but the small plates and meals are the real deal. There were four of us and we ate enough for twice as many.

Don&#39;t judge! We showed restraint.. there were so many things we wanted to try.. we actually had to compromise.

Small plate/ Appetizers.. Grilled Romaine, (winner! who&#39;d have thought?) Bacon wrapped dates, Ricotta Honeycomb, Italian Bean Dip, Fresh Mozzarella, Pepper Shrimp, Prosciutto Pie and more! 

Quick service, reasonable prices.. excellent atmosphere and great food.

Our server Valerie was so friendly upbeat and helpful with the menu.  The cheapest Pinot on the menu was absolutely delicious, they had a pretty solid draft beer menu and also long list of bottles and cans-many from local brew houses.  

The menu wasn&#39;t huge but I still couldn&#39;t narrow it down.  We ordered Pepper Shrimp, Stuffed Gnocchi, and the Arugula and Pancetta Pizza.   The small plates were delicious and the wood fired pizza was good combo of crispy and chewy.  A bit of char, the Pancetta was crisp and the arugula and cheese were fresh.  I think I may have licked the plate clean from the Shrimp.  Absolutely delicious.  

Prices were actually very reasonable for the quality.

unfortunately that wasn&#39;t the case.
It was a Wednesday night about 6:30.
We called ahead to be put on the wait list as most reviewers suggested.
It was my wife and I.
There were 3 hostesses. 
I hope they are just new.
They acknowledged we called ahead and 
gave us a pager just like everyone else. We stood at the bar. Two minutes later they offered us a high top table. I explained that due to double knee replacement surgery my wife couldn&#39;t sit in the high chairs. The girl that seemed more in control then offered a table in the bar area that she described as 
&#34;More private&#34; it was also a high top table 
on the path to the kitchen and where all the servers picked up their drinks from the bar.
High top and not private.?
We went back to the bar and waited for 
a table at a normal height.
So much for calling ahead.

We like reisling  wine. They offered one reisling. Made our choice easier but come on! What&#39;s your restaurant&#39;s name?
 
Our pager went off!
No the table is  not ready, just checking to make sure a low table is ok- really? Now we&#39;re referring to the group of hostesses as the three stooges.

Yes ,we did finally get a table. Next to the screaming kids and family.

Our server arrived with the bottle of reisling 
we started in the bar area. Very good start.
Then he proceeded to give us a scripted 
5 minute tour of the wine list, beer list, nightly specials (read off a sheet in his guest check holder.) Didn&#39;t even acknowledge that we already had something to drink. 
The food was good.
We had 
Grilled lettuce
Ricotta and honey
Spicy shrimp
Spicy salami pizza

The tall tables haunted us. They ring the window area facing the street. Our booth view forced us to stare at people&#39;s legs and crotches.

We wouldn&#39;t go back. Too much negative."

The acoustics did lend itself to being overly loud at times.  The staff were  friendly and the service prompt.  The blackened shrimp and grits took me back to the south and they were grand!  The salmon was tasty, but not the taste bud joy of the shrimp.  My friend was a little disappointed in her rigatoni saying it was bland as well.  All in all, food experience."

I thought we were among the early diners. they said half an hour.... an hour later.... we finally got seated. the high top by the window is perfect, glad we escaped the booth, they look so tight.  there were four of us and we ordered shirmp with polenta, shrimp with angel hair pasta, mussels, sopressata pizza, so spicy, short rib ragu and pork belly.  yeah its a lot of food for four, but we ate it .  all was fantastic, I would order any one of them to eat by itself for dinner, except the pizza way to spicy.  I would like to go back and try other things on the menu, probably a weekday because the crowd and wait are the only turn offs.  
drinks were fantastic and they have a decent wine by the glass menu.  all in all a good experience. I would go back, and invite friends."

We ordered quite a few things off their menu, and *every* single thing I tasted was the best of its kind.

We started off with the arancini (and a Vanilla Porter for me, which was quite good thank you very much). As far as we could tell it was half real risotto and real mozzarella on the inside, with two different elements of crunchiness on the outside; the batter, and a smattering of thin, crunchy onion rings. There were six in total, and they don&#39;t get any better than this.

Just as we got done with the arancini, our pizzas came out. My wife got the prosciutto pie, and all I really managed to eat of it was a piece of prosciutto (absolutely marvelous) and an olive (mellowed, but still very flavorful). I was torn between artichoke and pesto, and the bianco; on recommendation from the server, I picked the artichoke and pesto and was rewarded with pleasantly bitter arugula, buttery artichoke and fresh pesto.

In both cases the crust was perfect. Flavorful, soft on the inside but with the perfect amount of chew. Top quality fresh ingredients all around, too.

For dessert we decided to get a butterscotch budino, but were also given a panna cotta, and I didn&#39;t argue. The panna cotta was creamy and slightly tangy, melding well with a whole blackberry and sauce on top. The budino was out-of-this-world excellent; thick, creamy, rich. Save room for dessert here, folks.

I have no doubts that we&#39;ll be back here again, for the best pizza we&#39;ve had since we came back from Naples."

Everything was great from the waitress&#39;s knowledge of the menu and wine, the size/taste of the pizzas, the quality of service, and gluten friendly menu. The restaurant had low lightening and soft music in the background. I saw people dressed up (like myself) or dressed very casual. Only warning is if you don&#39;t like sitting close to other parties, request seating ahead of time. I almost felt like I was on a date with the couple next to us ;)

Go! I highly recommend."

We came all the way from Naperville but were a bit underwhelmed, though it looked like a local favorite with lots of friends enjoying a meal together (in groups of 6-8 people per table).  We didn&#39;t try any of their famous fire-oven pizzas but the eggplant lasagna was quite good.  We also didn&#39;t get to try their zucchinis fries, because we had already had some as a snack at the Jameson Irish Pub (across the street) while waiting for our names to be called."

He didn&#39;t suggest anything. Being there for the first time, I would have liked to have heard some specials.  I asked if they had Sangria he said no. He suggested a drink with Cantaloupe, but he had no idea what it was called.  It was sooo good, although I don&#39;t care for vodka. Either way, I severely over tipped.  I&#39;m a light weight."

Service was overly prompt and appropriately friendly. We came early in the day, so no dinner rush delays. Pizza and ricotta honeycomb out within about 5 minutes of ordering. We didn&#39;t know what to expect of it, other than the Yelpers had liked it.  And, sure enough, it was amazing.  We got a few more pieces of bread so that we could properly finish off all of the spread.  

Pizza was cooked all the way thru, but not very hot in the middle. Still amazing, but another 30 seconds in the oven would have made it absolutely perfect. 

We also split a bottle of red and an order of tiramisu for dessert.  Both were also great.

Pricing as good or better than expected for the quality (portions appropriately small- the two of us comfortably split everything). $80-ish for an app, pizza, dessert, and mid-range bottle of red. No complaints."

Have had a few different glasses of wine, cocktails as well as beers from their list. They try to keep it pretty local for the beers and have great choices to choose from when it comes to wine and liquor from the bar!

Everything I have eaten is great and full of flavor and taste! One of my favorite things on the menu is the Grilled Romaine Salad. It is big enough to share as an appetizer with a friend or two or even for yourself for a meal. One of the best things on the menu but I say that about everything! I love the Pastas, Pizzas and dishes as well. One of my go to&#39;s is the Salmon or even a vodka Pasta. Again you cant pick a bad thing because there isnt anything bad on the menu!

The service is always amazing and the staff here are super friendly and knowledgable on the menu. Love when they are able to help me pair my wine/beer to a great dish. Servers make great recommendations when it comes to wine and will even give you a little taste prior to ordering a full glass. Thoroughly enjoy a few of their servers in particular that I like to request them if they are in for the night and will wait a little longer to be sat in their section ( Yda or Nate). Love their character, personableness and table-side manner. When it comes to this place you cannot go wrong!

We called ahead and they said there was no wait, we showed up 10 minutes later and they told us 1.5-2 hour wait. I told them I was frustrated and began to leave. An older woman who was managing the multiple teenage hostesses stopped me from leaving just to explain to me why I was wrong.

All 4 of us were very excited to try this place out and were not disappointed. I see a lot of reviewers talk about the wait. (We used to live in the city so we are used to having to wait a bit for good food!) We called ahead and put down our name for the call ahead list (not reservations) for 8:15pm. We got there early checked in and headed to the irish pub across the street for drinks while we waited. We got a call about 15 mins after our call ahead time. Our server Jennifer was awesome, brought out samples of wine for us to taste before ordering, and gave us great recommendations. We ordered the crisp pork belly, the ricotta with honeycomb, mussells, black pepper shrimp (comes with polenta)  and the regina margherita pizza to split between 4 people. Everything was delicious and our favorite was the tender crisp pork belly. Great flavor. Everyone was very happy with their wine as well. They have an extensive list of craft beers for the non winos! This place is awesome for a date night or even a girls night! Music wasn&#39;t too loud and we could hear everyone at the table. We will be back!"

This is one of our favorite restaurants. The owners and staff are great people who truly enjoy what they do. They seem like one big happy family. 

Now to the food. The menu has a wide variety of items. Start with the house salad. Seriously one of the best I&#39;ve ever had. The menu is filled with top notch dishes from top to bottom. Pizzas are unique always changing. They have dishes that range from octopus, scallops, pasta dishes, hangar steak, prosciutto plate, meatballs, and a killer calzone. Never had a bad dish and they are always prepared perfectly. 

Wine selection is awesome and wide ranging yet very reasonably priced. The bar tenders can always direct you to something good depending on your preferences.

We had: 
Cosmos- very refreshing and nice orange flavor ($9)

Ricotta/honeycomb small plate- delicious and fun to try- would like about twice the amount of bread and honeycomb for the price though ($10)

House salad- really tasty house dressing, pecans, Gorgonzola, fennel, greens and tomatoes ($6)

Shrimp and avocado salad- also really good, shrimp were cooked well and had a nice flavor ($14)

Vodka pasta- fresh pasta with a spicy tomato cream sauce and crispy pancetta. I really liked it! You have to like spicy though. ($14)

Kale and mushroom pizza- wood-fired, nice crust and flavor- my friend said it was good! ($14) 

Homemade donuts- so good! Little pieces of fried dough with powdered sugar and a chocolate/honey dipping sauce. Enough for 4. ($5)

Kate is a great server she is very personable and really make you feel like your part of the fire and wine family. The atmosphere Is a upbeat cozy dark wine cellar feel lit with many candles and high top tables. The Honey comb ricotta appetizer the homemade Pizzas and pasta specials are a must. If you are a Nutella fan they have a Nutella stuffed calzone with chocolate sauce. There tower of doughnuts with dipping sauces are irresistible.  This place is kid friendly and offers choices off the kids menu. They are always changing the menu seasonally and they offer suggestions on comment cards. I had recently suggested a sangria sorbet to my waitress Kate. I hope to see it on the menu in the near future. The only down fall is  I would recommend going later in the evening or week day they are a popular place and do not take reservations but who came blame them for being so popular .

Black Pepper Shrimp: OhmyGod...truly perfect. Quality shrimp, small roasted peppers, polenta with just the right amount of creamy sauce. Everything I want in a dish is in here.

Meatball sliders: Tender meatballs with a lovely roasted tomato sauce on fresh bread.

Four cheese pizza: Great take on a rather simplistic pie.

Decor: The bar area is a pretty standard bar and the restaurant portion is nicely decorated with a real &#34;homey&#34; feel. It is a very welcoming place to enjoy a meal or some drinks. The light level is low but helps to make it feel more intimate and set a low-key vibe. We had a table just inside the restaurant part so I didn&#39;t get a chance to see how large the entire place is or how many tables they might have.
Bathroom: Just like the rest of the place it is nicely kept and very inviting

Staff: The bartender (pre-dinner drinks) and our waiter were very friendly and attentive. Whenever our drinks were empty they were ready and willing to refill and the food was delivered very quickly. We also chatted with the owner who is a very cool guy who does exactly what you would want an owner to do: he manned the bar a bit, chatted with customers, and shot the shit with us despite his time being obviously stretched very thin. It&#39;s the small touches that are outstanding.

Food: Wow. Let me say that again, WOW. Everything we had was outstanding. We started with some bourbon (Maker&#39;s - a little larger selection would be cool) and then were seated for dinner. We began with the Mussels (SO DAMN GOOD) and the Prosciutto Di Parma (yum!) and then had Filet of Beef Medallions and the Hanger Steak (both superb!). For dessert we had bourbon Old Fashions and then a round of beers at the bar.

Value: The prices are respectable for the serving sizes. Factor in the level of service and the taste of the food and you are more than getting your money&#39;s worth.

This place is wonderful and I cannot wait until I am back in town to come back!"

All joking aside, this was one of the best desserts I&#39;ve had.  If only the small dish was the size of a semi-truck tire, then it would have been perfect.  Panna Cotta is like an Italian pudding, and Fire + Wine adds this balsamic drizzle and salt that combines well with the sweetness.

Ok wait.  Rewind.  I ate dinner here too.  Fire + Wine was a perfect halfway point for my friend and I to meet.  I arrived first and settled in with a glass of Prosecco.  Our waitress was also very sweet and attentive.

Many of the small plates were temping, like the arancini, burrata, or ricotta with honeycomb.  Do you see a pattern here?  So many cheesy options!  But I ordered a pizza instead, hoping to return sometime with a small group to do the small plates.

I loved my pizza.  I had the White Pizza, with mozzarella, goat cheese, pickled hot peppers, and basil.  Fire + Wine makes Neopolitan-style pizza which was perfectly chewy and not at all charred or burnt.  I didn&#39;t eat the whole thing; one pizza and perhaps a salad would make a nice meal for two.  I ate all but 2-3 slices and ate the rest for lunch the next day.

I enjoyed my meal here, but arriving early is always a good idea.  I got a table without any wait on a Wednesday at 5:30 p.m.  By the time we left, there were several people waiting for a table.  Fire + Wine is a great choice for a (quiet) ladies night out or a date night."

The prosciutto dish was my husband&#39;s favorite because he is a cured meat fanatic.  I&#39;m not really a fan, but the roasted peppers, artichokes, mozzarella, bread, and arugula won me over by being extremely flavorful and fresh.  The salad had some of the best shrimp I&#39;ve ever had in the Midwest - they were large, plump, and perfectly cooked!  The pizza to me was the star of the show (my husband disagrees).  The crust was perfect and the mushrooms were actually a unique assortment of wild mushrooms and not just &#34;baby bellas&#34; or something.  

We also had some wine - I would say that the wine was very good, but the server fell a little flat on recommendations.  But everything else was perfect.  We&#39;ll definitely come back, even with a super long wait and a bit of a drive to get there.  I was very pleased."

When we arrived there was no line so I&#39;m not sure if we needed to call or not but it was great. They sat us immediately at a small two top in the bar.  Our server (Heidi) was by far one of the best servers I have ever had anywhere.  I know that is a bold statement but she was friendly, extremely knowledgeable of the menu, helpful, and attentive! She provided great suggestions for both food and wine and all were absolutely delicious! We shared a spicy shrimp small plate and prosciutto pizza.  They were amazing! We also enjoyed a great red blend wine.  Dessert was a ridiculous Nutella and fruit pastry. It was out of this world!!! Prices are decent for what you are getting.  Obviously the purchase of a bottle of wine made our check a bit more than typical but it still wasn&#39;t bad.  Highly recommend! I will absolutely be back!"

I have so many great ways to describe the amazing hospitality we received from your entire team. The first impression of the restaurant was awesome, cozy but not cramped, modern yet rustic, lively and energetic. Even in a huge snowstorm, the restaurant was buzzing-that&#39;s saying something! Amy, our server, was so sweet. She was incredibly accommodating, friendly and so genuine. Starting off our dinner with the signature martini was a great option, but once the bubbles arrived to the table, the true celebrations had begun! I have the highest of praise for the food, drinks and associates at Fire + Wine and I have already shared my excellent experience with many of my friends and will continue to do so for a long while. 

My HIGHEST recommendation for Fire + Wine!"

I&#39;ve heard so many great things about Fire + Wine and since we are moving away from the area soon, I knew we needed to try it out before then! We visited on a Thursday and as I expected we had about 30 minute wait before we could get a table.  The bar area was also pretty full so we didn&#39;t even end up getting drinks prior to our dinner.

We had a nice quiet table in the back which was really enjoyable because we were easily able to carry on a conversation.  We order the prosciutto di parma which included prosciutto, artichoke hearts, housemade mozzerella, and balsamic, the medjool dates and chorizo, and bianco pizza.  Everything was the bomb.com.  If I had to choose a favorite I would probably pick the dates &amp; chorizo.  The combination has never sounded for good in theory to me, but in practice it is amazing.  Plus the spicy red sauce that covered the dish was also amazing.  I could eat those everyday.

I really loved the pizza too.  The butternut squash and sage combination is one of my absolute favorites plus it was cheesy and a little bit salty.  Our server tried to convince us to get dessert and I&#39;m sure the desserts are also amazing but I stuffed myself to full with the pizza so we had to pass.  I cannot wait to visit here again to try dessert.

Even though the restaurant was full, I was surprised with how quickly our orders came out.  Plus they staggered our dishes so we didn&#39;t have to wait long for our first dish to come out.  

If you are looking for a great date night restaurant this place could be it!"

I love that they have a diverse menu of small plates, pizza, and entrees.  Every ingredient they use is fresh and you can definitely taste the quality in everything they make.  I had the muscles to start which were delicious.  It&#39;s all in the broth with muscles and they didn&#39;t disappoint.  I could of just ordered more bread and soaked up all the broth for my meal but I did not.  

I ordered a shrimp and pesto pizza as my main dish and it was so good!  I love the thin crust and how you can taste the wood fire in it.

The food is superb. The Aricini mozzarella and zucchini fries are really good appetizers.  We enjoyed their specialty pizza when we tried it,  but we usually get a pasta dish.

According to their website, they don&#39;t take reservations...some of these reviews made me think I&#39;d be standing in line to get in if my timing was bad so my friend and I settled for an early dinner to beat the rush.  We got here about 5pm on a Saturday night.

I had pasta on Christmas Eve so I wasn&#39;t in the mood for pasta...next visit here I need to try pasta for sure!  We were undecided about so many things... beer or wine? What appetizer?

So we settled for a glass of wine to pair with our dinner - we got the arancini for an appetizer, pizza with sausage &amp; pepperoni (I can&#39;t recall the one we ordered) and for dessert, flourless chocolate cake which wasn&#39;t on the dessert menu, but recommended by our server.
Our server was pretty great, she recommended a wine we might like and offered up samples ahead of time.  I ended up ordering a second glass of wine, being the one she mentioned.

I&#39;m glad we got in early and made a reservation as we were leaving, the place was getting crowded, there isn&#39;t much room to hang out in the bar area, if people are sitting at the bar."

Gnocci - best I&#39;ve had, they seemed to be slightly fried which made it more enjoyable.  They gave me a panna cotta for my birthday, which I&#39;ve never tried and we loved it - it had a pinch too much of sea salt - but still very good!

The waiter brought the hash browns with my meal and stated they are extra crispy and asked if that is OK. I stated yes, that is fine.

The one thing I did notice is the offerings are pretty basic and similar to what you would find at any Greek diner.

I ordered one egg over medium with bacon. It also came with hash browns and a choice of pancakes, toast or french toast. I chose pancakes.

We called ahead but unfortunately they do not take reservations on weekends.  After a short 15 minute wait, we were seated in a cozy corner booth.  They have a large menu with typical breakfast items, salads, sandwiches, burgers, etc.  Our sever was very friendly but our food took a bit longer to arrive than I expected it to.  

The majority of us opted for lunch items - tuna salad, chicken salad, French dip.  2 opted for breakfast - bacon skillet and veggie skillet.  Both skillets were large and looked really fresh.  My chicken salad sandwich on white toast looked delicious on its plate, but was pretty bland.  The salad seemed to be only chicken, mayo and celery.  No salt/pepper or spices.  The coleslaw was great but I wish the portion was larger.  My fries had obviously been sitting under a warmer for awhile.  I don&#39;t think anyone in our party was really wowed by their meals.

Overall, I&#39;d be willing to try Egg Cited again.  Hoping this was just an off-morning for them!"

We hadn&#39;t been before and it was close to where we were. My first impression was that it&#39;s a very bright and nice looking place. It was very clean. We were seated right away. The server was a very pleasant older lady. She took our drink orders and brought them back right away. I got coffee and she took my creamer bowl and said she&#39;d be back with more, I waited for about 5 minutes for her to return. That seemed to be the pattern for the rest of our meal. With my son and my meal we had the option of soup or upgrade to a salad for a dollar more. My son ordered the salad with ranch but she brought him the soup. She delivered the soup and left and my son ended up eating the soup. No big deal. The dumpling soup was good. I ordered a fruit bowl for my daughter which for almost 4.00 was a joke, a few grapes, one strawberry, a piece of pineapple, and honey dew. My son ordered a burger, I ordered a Malibu chicken sandwich with avocado, and my daughter got a Mickey Mouse pancake. My meal and my sons meal were brought to us together, we waited another 5 minutes for my little one to get her meal. My son said his burger was ok, my daughter ate most of her pancake, I didn&#39;t enjoy my pick. The chicken sandwich was chicken strips which were bland, my sandwich had no flavor what so ever. The fries were as my son put it &#34;weird &#34; they were crispy and coated with crumbs or something. We didn&#39;t like them. 
Very nice place, friendly staff but our server forgot way to many things and we ended up waiting longer than we should have, food was nothing spectacular. We won&#39;t be back."

The decor alone is enough to get one EggCited before a meal. As a side note when traveling westbound on Hassert Blvd. towards Rt 59 there is a hidden entrance way on the south side of street allowing access inside the EggCited plaza. Let&#39;s call it the secret James Bond entrance :)

Upon entering the building there was a lovely host that will greet you and accompany you to your booth or table. Within a few seconds my server Yesenia introduced herself as she grabbed my drink order. She returned with a pretty tasty cup of coffee freshly brewed.

I was set on ordering breakfast before I even entered the building. I just wasn&#39;t sure what to order.They have so many options from pancakes, omelettes, french toast, crepes and the list goes on. So I literally closed my eyes took a moment and pointed. When I opened my eyes my finger landed on the &#34;Popeye&#39;s Skillet&#34;. Great choice!!!! Served with crispy bacon, spinach and mushrooms. We got a winner!!

As soon as I cut into my skillet a nice cloud of steam rose up from the plate as if the angular momentum of Earth was working alongside my meal. I would go on record saying the Popeye&#39;s Skillet was on point and the hashbrowns on the bottom absolutely fresh.

In conclusion friendly staff, quick refills and comfy cushion booths. I look forward to my next visit and will explore the lunch side of the menu."

I am a white woman and I was dining with my three Hispanic sisters in law. The attitude our server had was unreal. Now I understand some people have bad days or they just have resting bitch face but this was not the case. She served all the other &#34;white&#34; tables around us cheerfully and with a smile. With our table she asked &#34;what do you want?&#34; And with theirs she said &#34;what can I get for you today?&#34; And sometimes even gently touched their shoulders. Her unkindness and hatred was just so blatantly obvious and honestly sad.

 I have been a breakfast guy for many years and this place at times had decent food. Over the last couple of months the food has gone downhill, at least it has for me.
One note, they do have some pretty good soups. If you try them, the slit pea is excellent.
The biggest draw for me were the servers, They are truly some of the best I have ever had. Even the people that bus the tables are friendly.
Now, on to the food. The food is very bland, They seem to cater to the older crowd, so maybe they are cooking to their tastes, or stomachs as it may well be. Good food should not need salt and pepper almost every time.
The biscuits and gravy is terrible. There is absolutely no taste at all to the gravy. 
The eggs have no taste, I see people sending them back because they are not done correctly. A diner should not have to remind the servers every time they come in that the eggs need to be done a certain way and that ham slices must be correctly cooked. Look, a regular diner does not need to manage the preparation of their food. 
The hot turkey that they feature on Fridays in dry and the gravy has no taste whatsoever. I became of those diners that needed the salt and pepper just to get a little flavor to the sauce.
I had the turkey a few times, hoping that it would improve, but I was always disappointed.
Finally, with all the excellent breakfast places in Plainfield, they need to hire a hostess that has the maturity to interact with the diners, especially ones that have given the place so much business in the past.
The biggest shame is that the owners, while nice people, feel that it is more important to maintain their staff, regardless of how they treat the customers. 
Keeping loyal customers does not seem to be important to them IMHO"

The best part was the hostess.  My son closed the car door on his finger in the parking lot, and the hostess noticed right away when we walked in that something was wrong.  She asked him, he showed her his banged up finger, and she immediately brought him a bag of ice and a band aid, and checked back a few minutes later to see how he was doing.

Chose the &#34;EggCited Stuffed French toast&#34; (was on the menu when restaurant was Gigi&#39;s) and sadly discovered this place wouldn&#39;t be a repeat.  The amount of cream cheese in this french toast dish wouldn&#39;t have covered a bagel for Barbie and the temperature was barely (literally) warm.  My brother&#39;s omelet was also barely warm.

My son ordered chocolate milk. It came in a glass that had NO rim, meaning it was broken and fractured. I caught it before he put to his mouth and cut himself. The manager said he was sorry, the waitress says it happens all the time. 

Food took forever to arrive. Really, pancakes and sausage should be at the ready. When they did arrive, they were good. I had to ask for my coffee refill each time.

When I went for lunch about a month ago, I had a turkey avocado club and everything was delicious.  The toast was crisp, the lettuce was green and crunchy, the turkey was moist and the fries were excellently seasoned.
When I was there for breakfast a couple weekends ago, I had a veggie omelet and it looked like a little football!  The veggies inside appeared to be hand-cut, and not like it was some kind of frozen pre-cut bag of mixed veg.  The broccoli and mushrooms were firm and the onion had a bit of crispness left in it.  The hash browns were delicious.  Nothing was too greasy.  Perfect breakfast.  Good portion sizes.  I was stuffed and had no leftovers.
The waiters were very helpful both times, but this time for breakfast, the manager came over when I mentioned my dairy allergy.  He made sure nothing was cooked in dairy oils or butter, and that there was no milk and cheese in my omelet.  The waiter and manager were very accommodating!  Lovely on a busy Saturday morning.
One thing they could improve is to have some alternative milks available like almond or coconut or soy.  I don&#39;t like black coffee.
It was kid friendly for my 3 year old who was given some crayons and paper, and my baby who was still in the car seat carrier.  There was enough room for his seat to stay on the floor by my foot, so I could rock him as he slept.  I love the booths, too!"

The bad is the food was horribly bland.  I got the biscuits and gravy and a side of hash browns.  I put salt and pepper on all of it.  I never salt my food, ever.  The gravy had virtually no sausage in it and I&#39;m still pondering over whether it was sausage gravy or chipped beef and they made a mistake.  There was also entirely too much gravy.  It was very thick and fatty like dry wall mud.  My girlfriend got a waffle with strawberries.  They forgot the whipped cream.

The quality of the food was good but service could have been better. I wish they were a little more EggCited about making sure each person in the party got his food at the same time and not 15 minutes after the rest of the group.

I&#39;d have to say this place is designed to only accommodate groups of 4 or less since 80% of the seats are booths to seat 2 - 4 people. Being a group of 5, we were quoted 15min for a table, not bad. There was another group of 5 and 9 in front of us waiting as well. While we stood there waiting, no less than 15 groups of 2 or 4 people were seated. After 30min of waiting, and neither group ahead of us had even been seated either, we left. As we were pulling out of the parking spot, we saw the other group of 5 in front of us leaving as well...

Other observations were that the servers were certainly not on top of their game as they show up to the tables guessing what the food was and not having a clue who ordered it. I think every person I saw served had to dump salt all over the hashbrowns. The omlettes did look decent, but the kids plates that passed by looked, well, boring. Like I said, probably trying to appeal to smaller groups without kids or something. 

Overall I&#39;d say they need to work on things or redesign the place so it&#39;s more &#34;family friendly&#34;. Can&#39;t comment too much on the food, but based on our &#34;eggsperience&#34; I don&#39;t know that we will be back."

Even though it was pretty slammed, we were seated in less than 5 mins. Pretty big seating capacity with lots of booths. They might have been under staffed when we went. Better ask for multiple waters, seemed like the servers had to do a lot of their own table busing. Got one refill on water, only after asking.

Certainly the place to come of you&#39;re hungry.  Crepes are tender and moist, omlettes are very tasty and juice is fresh-squeezed.  The coffee is very good.

After trying this place for the first time, I was hooked. The atmosphere is bright ,pleasant and clean. The waitstaff are all pretty good, but two really stand out: Cindy - very friendly, always wearing a big smile, couldn&#39;t be any nicer. Probably the most efficient waitress I have run into anywhere. She makes it look easy. always ready with friendly chatter too, so plesant. The hostess Brittany, another with a smile that never ends, went out of her way to get to know me by name one of the first few times there. now I walk in there and I go to have breakfast but it is so much more enjoyable going somewhere you know your going to have GREAT SERVICE and fantastic food....EVERY TIME. I won&#39;t go anywhere else for breakfast if given the choice. lastly. I&#39;ve had lunch here a couple times, the soups with garlic bagel chips are awesome and their burgers were surprisingly good as well. look forward to sampling more options on the menu, haven&#39;t been served anything less than REALLY GOOD here. Highly recommended. p.s. the bacon -n- onion skillet is my current favorite for breakfast. If you go, ask for Cindy&#39;s section, you won&#39;t be dissappointed."

Coffee was hot and fresh.  The in-laws both had skillets,not sure which ones, both said they were really good. You get a side with the skillet, m-i-l got strawberry pancakes, there was a slight up charge but the pancakes were covered in fresh strawberries.  Husband had blueberry pancakes, he thought they were just average and prefers the ones from Blueberry Hill.  I tried a make your own omelet - pepper jack with bacon,  It was huge and very tasty.

On the day of my completing the application I could not get a firm answer on when and how I would be able to speak to the hiring manager. According to Brittany the hostess she is never there on the same day or the same time and didn&#39;t know when I can get in touch with her. I come to learn a coworker of mine called the same day about an interview and an application. Britney answered the phone and willingly shared the time the owner/hiring manager would be available along with the hours. Is it right to pick and choose who you give equal opportunity to?

We stopped early afternoon on a Sunday and found the restaurant not crowded, but reasonably busy.  The wait staff was pleasant and efficient and the facility was clean.  I was particularly pleased to see that tables and booths were not squeezed in like some breakfast places.

I ordered an omelet and I was less than eggcited with it.  The texture was unusual and I got the impression that it was made with some sort of filler or batter mixed in with the eggs.  I also got the impression that it may have been a pre-cooked, frozen omelet that was finished in the microwave.  On the other hand, my wife said that her crepes were good.

My other comment is that the servings are too big.  I know that this is a popular approach currently, but I don&#39;t care for it.  Huge servings tend to encourage people to overeat."

Granted, I know this restaurant is relatively new to the area and is still most likely working out the bugs, but come on--there is a lot of work to be done in order for me to be &#34;egg cited&#34; enough to want to return.  For starters, we had to wait 15 minutes when there were several open booths and tables available.  The hostess was a tad rude and ignored us while the manager was asking if we had been helped when he had been standing there the whole time.  Yah, no...try to be a bit more courteous to your patrons, please.  Secondly, being that today is a holiday, why didn&#39;t this restaurant plan on having more staff readily available?  That&#39;s poor planning in my opinion.  Once we were finally seated in a vacant area, we waited several minutes before our waitress came to take our drink order.  I am a big fan of Eggs Benedict, so I requested to sample some of their hollandaise sauce.  It took a long time to receive the sample, so by the time it arrived, it was cold.  No matter--it tasted like a lemony tartar sauce of sorts--gross!  My partner and I opted to order lunch after waiting what seemed to be an eternity for our server to FINALLY come and take our order.  Waiting on two other tables can be tough, I know.  The soup tasted nothing short of a hybrid between Campbell&#39;s and Progresso.  The portion sizes were super small, and the bread sticks that accompanied the soups were solid as a rock.  Once the sandwiches finally arrived, we were excited to dig in; however, we were both disappointed in the quality and taste.  My chicken salad sandwich lacked any sort of flavor, the cole slaw had way too much vinegar, the pickle tasted weird and was room temperature, and the fries were the standard &#34;special coated&#34; fries you can get at any diner.  Actually, the fries were the best part of the meal--tra la, tra la.  My partner ordered a Buffalo chicken wrap that fell apart and didn&#39;t come with any dressings.  It was simply a spicy mound of meat in a cheap tortilla wrap.  The prices weren&#39;t terrible; however, there are plenty of other family style/greasy spoon restaurants in the area with better food and service."

While people rave about their Italian beef I have always raved about their chicken sandwich. This past summer they stopped serving said sandwich and posted papers telling customers that it was temporary due to the vendor. I was pretty bummed. Finally after months of withdrawals they brought the sandwich back and I&#39;m sad to say it&#39;s a huge disappointment. The flavor of the chicken is not the same and neither is the quality. I&#39;ve had it 3 times from 3 different locations and it&#39;s been bad every time. Very sad . So now I have to find a new item to love. 
Besides the chicken sandwich my favorites are the crinkly fries, chocolate cake and the chopped salad. Portillos is always a good option for good tasting fast food. You can never go wrong with their hot dogs, well... Unless you go right before closing, they might be sold out by then. My boyfriend ordered their jumbo dog and after paying and waiting a few minutes he was told they were all out."

Have yet to have something I didn&#39;t like in 30 years. 

Go for the 
Italian Beefs
Burgers
Hot Dogs
This location has Barnelli&#39;s which makes GREAT pastas as well.

The jumbo chili cheese dog is amazing, the fries are incredible, the italian beef is out of this world (as long as its dipped with mozz and hot peppers lol), the salads are incredible, the soups are amazing, the pasta dishes are fresh, the ribs are fall off the bone tender, the chicken sandwich is a winner. 

Although my 2 favorite items are the chocolate cake shake and the burger. I get the cheeseburger with bacon and its chargrilled to perfection, the bun is soft, the bacon is crispy, it&#39;s just a classic burger. 

The chocolate cake shake is a MUST for anyone that has never had it. Please please please try it, you will not be disappointed."

While the food is decent the service is lacking and the time it takes to prepare an order for a family of 3 is often way too long. When I get my food home, the bags are usually ripped open &amp; falling apart because 
they&#39;re using cheap bags. You can&#39;t often read the register receipt because the heat from the food has lightened the ink, again using cheap material. (The bag &amp; receipt problem is something I&#39;ve experienced at every Portillo&#39;s I carried out food from over the years.) I thought the Portillo&#39;s name meant quality. Whatever corporation is running Portillo&#39;s now, needs to step up their game! It&#39;s unlikely that I&#39;ll visit this Portillo&#39;s again as they are out of chances.

It&#39;s pasta with aioli, garlic, onion,pine nuts, broccoli, cheese and chicken.  Last night this dish was brought home for me and when I opened it the smell hit me first.

They have the best American fast food of anyone of course. Their prices are way too high but it doesn&#39;t seem to hurt their business. They are always crowded. I particularly like the fact that there is a Barnelli&#39;s there. So there is a huge variety overall to select from. The food at both places is great. One of my favorites is the chopped salad. I also crave the panini sandwiches they have. Both are good. On the Portillos side everything is good. Their ribs can&#39;t be beat and all the sandwiches are awesome.

Like countless other kids growing up in the Chicago burbs with Portillos it is just Heartbreaking to watch this location go down the pooper. I can rate this honestly because we go every single week at various times. The drive thru at every location used to be run like a Swiss watch. Fast, friendly, and orders were accurate. Complete opposite now. The staffers are on some kinda work release program or act the part, it&#39;s all to common to hear &#34;N&#34; this and that, swearing all while your waiting and listening thru the window and your praying the orders right. Order a beef dipped hot with onion rings and coke, you get a chewy beef with stale bread thats been splashed with juice, a bag with three rings and a diet coke WTF... I&#39;ve found myself wondering if it&#39;s because Mr Portillo doesn&#39;t visit and observe locations anymore. I&#39;ve gone to Johnnys in Elmwood Park past couple times cause it&#39;s on my way home and I&#39;m just tired of the people and hit or miss food nowadays at this location. It wasn&#39;t until Mr Portillo sold his hard earned franchise that I realized how hard he worked to ensure the people he hired and food he served was just as high quality as he was.

I grew up just down the street from the original location on North Ave in Villa Park, which the design of is awful, where this one has a great design, large and plenty of seating. Being paired with a Barnellis gives this location many extra items to choose from. I wish I could give half stars, this would be a 3.5 review.

Atmosphere- very nice, big and expansive, cool theme, comfortable, many tables and many booths, often crowded showing its popularity (stay away on friday nights)
Service- this is by far their fall down, when things are busy I expect things to be not as quick, but in some cases it takes forever, sometimes over 20 minutes and in one instance over a half hour for a hamburger and fries, my shake had completely melted. This isnt however my most common complaint. I could not even keep track of all the times they have messed up an order, busy or not. Cheeseburger with no cheese, missing an order of fries, missing hotdog, missing polish, wrong topping on the hot dog. This is by far the most common problem.
Food- Portillos is Portillos because of the food, the chicago style hot dog and the italian beef are by far the populars and their mainstays, but I must say, their burgers are probably my favorite menu item
Drink- i do not tend to get much to drink as I live close by, but I have never been disappointed by their shakes, the chocolate cake shake being the obvious must try option, yummm
Prices- some things are overpriced and some things are well priced"

I get it extra dipped wet juicy with sweet peppers. I love the Maxwell Street Polish with relish and extra onion. They have some of the best hot dogs ever but I do enjoy redhots as well. Burgers are very good. I love the chicken club sandwich. Ribs are very good but I dont love the sauce and Id prefer ribs from a legit BBQ place anyday but theyre good. Chopped salads are awesome as well as some other salads. I can go on forever. OH! Loves me a vanilla shake from Portillo&#39;s as well!

The jumbo hot dog with everything on it is so filling. If you&#39;re a big appetite kind of person then get two. The onion rings are greasy and crunchy. Not bad for the price you pay. My friends got the burgers and fries. It&#39;s also filling. Unfortunately,  they found some hair in their fries. The chili is good and recommended.

Overall pretty good and affordable. Locals recommend the ribs. I&#39;ll try it out on my next visit."

I liked the design of the building with the 60&#39;s theme.  I first ordered the portillo&#39;s hot dog chicago style, I shared one with my parents and it was so good we downed the hot dog in minutes.  The portillo hot dog has a juicy dog with pickles, tomato, hot pepper.  It was great!

Next, I tried the famous italian beef sandwhich.  The italian beef was dipped in gravy ( must do, so good!) and it came with hot peppers.  When I first saw the italian beef sandwhich and it was greasy, I knew it was going to be good.  The first bite into the dog was juicy, powerful flavor, and all around satisfying.  I could not wait to stuff down the dog, the beef tasted extra flavorful after being dipped in gravy, and hot peppers gave a nice kick to the beef.  The hot peppers were not too spicy, it was more of a medium spice.  If you like a little bit of spice in your food, def. get it.

Then yesterday afternoon I started feeling awful. Then really sick. Then I continued to spew up until the wee hours of the morning, when I finally ended up at the ER because things were just getting worse.


Thanks for the crappy sandwich and the hospital bill. I didn&#39;t even get a sponge bath from a hot nurse. It was probably because of the whole &#39; my body is trying to turn itself out through the mouth&#39; thing i had going on. Which reminds me, wasn&#39;t inside out boy on liquid television?

Upon arriving at our friends house to sit down and eat, we noticed that my fruit and poppy salad&#39;s dressing and the chopped salad&#39;s house dressing was nowhere to be found. We also noticed we receive no bread, but DID get four containers of Parmesan cheese. 

I called the restaurant and spoke with an associate who then directed me to Scott, the &#34;manager&#34;. I explained the situation to Scott who lacks customer service skills. He made remarks like &#34;And the meal was ruined because you didn&#39;t get the bread, right?&#34; No, the meal is ruined because there&#39;s no dressing genius. 

He asked if we would be coming back to get the dressings, and I explained we weren&#39;t driving from Bartlett back to Glendale Heights for dressing for a salad. He asked for my address so he could send a voucher for two free salads, which was really nice...except that was three weeks ago and it never came.

I think they worry about us when we don&#39;t show up.  That&#39;s how awesome the staff is there.  We&#39;ve had several family events there and we&#39;ve always been treated so great by both Portillo&#39;s and Barnelli&#39;s staff.  The food is always on par everytime, but what brings us back is the kindness of the staff.  We were sad to find out Peggy (my daughter&#39;s favorite staff member at Portillo&#39;s) moved to another location, but wanted somehow to express our gratitude for the greatest service from her.  Eileen is also another staff member who never fails to say hello and catch up each time she&#39;s working and we are there.  Jason is a manager at Barnelli&#39;s and is always so helpful and kind when ever we are there.  And then there is Sergio, another staff member who always says hello to my kids when we are there and always makes sure to tell our little one to eat her food so she can grow up big and strong.  We literally have been going to this location almost every wednesday night for the past 10 years. These staff members I&#39;ve mentioned and many others whom I don&#39;t remember their names at the moment are so great, that they feel like family.  Thank you Portillo&#39;s and Barnelli&#39;s staff for always being so great!"

Not bad, not bad at all. All the toppings work very well together but it becomes more like a sandwich. As an East Coast guy I&#39;ll stick with Texas wieners. With that said, the chili cheese dog was a complete disappointment. The bun was the predominant taste and texture and that shouldn&#39;t be the case. 

The Italian beef sandwich on the other hand is legit. I could eat them all day! And the extra gravy made good, better. An absolutely messy eat, but that just added to the experience. 

In closing, the chocolate cake shake was heaven in a cup!"

This place is basically a Portillo&#39;s on Steroids, and that&#39;s alright by me.

Any Portillo&#39;s location that has a Barnelli&#39;s location is always better in my book, because you have so many more options. Do I feel like stuffing my face with a cheeseburger (which, if you haven&#39;t had, you must. They are cooked really well and don&#39;t look like those poor excuses for a hamburger that McD&#39;s tries to pass off.) or maybe a big Italian beef sammich or a dog. Or maybe I&#39;ll be classy and order some baked mostacholi (don&#39;t judge me on my definition of classy). 

They also have some really great salads. I&#39;m not a salad person as I typically don&#39;t think of it as a full meal, but their options really could suffice as such. My mom and I are fans of the strawberry poppy-seed salad with chicken. That&#39;ll fill you up nice and good. It&#39;s really fresh. It&#39;s possible it&#39;s still high on calories, but the way I see it, I&#39;m getting my fill of fruit, so where&#39;s the problem?

There customer service is really good and the dinning environment is well decorated with antique decor.  I seem to find a different antique to catch my attention every time I go.

However, my one caveat about this location is that you can get screwed in the drive-though.  On 3 separate occasions, our order has been wrong coming home from the drive-through.  One time, we ordered cheese fries only to get home and discover they forgot to include the cheese.  Another time, we ordered caramel pecan cake and got home to find a slice of plain chocolate cake.  The last time we drove through, we ordered one of the combo meals, only to be told we didn&#39;t order the combo and the drink would be extra.

Everytime I go visit, I stop at Portillo&#39;s for their Italian Beef and Chicago dogs.

The place looks like a chain and it is, but a small one. The buildings are large with lots of seating. At busy times, every seat it filled, but they open quickly. 

They have a variety of options to choose. You walk up to a counter and they write your order on a paper bag, then proceed down to the other end and enjoy the show. 

Most locations have a person at this point who get all the compents of your order together and then yells your numbers. You will usually get a notice like &#34;Number 59, You&#39;re so fine!&#34;. 

This is a great place to go to for a quick bite of two Chicago classics.

Italian Beef - many ways to order. Variety of sizes also. You can go dry, wet (juice poured on), or dipped (dunked in the beef juice). With or without Gardiner (a hot pepper/celery mixture) and cheese (optional). I usually go with a dipped beef, gardiner, mozz . It&#39;s de-lish!

Now onto the dogs,

The Chicago Dog - It&#39;s looks like a crazy cluster f*** of an item but it works! Get one for yourself or to split, but get atleast one before you leave!

If you are one the floor immobilzed from the food, go back for some desert. Their chocolate cake is amazing, Very moist and great icing. If you like shakes, get the chocolate cake shake!"

I went out to this one with a group of 12 and it was not hard to find seating which surprised me. There was plenty of space and the theme of this particular restaurant was a sort of speakeasy type thing. Since Portillo&#39;s doesn&#39;t necessarily appeal to the vegetarian persuasion there was a pasta place in the same building that my sister and a few cousins tried out. The food was exceptional as always. I wish California&#39;s fast food french fries came with cheese to dip! I got an Italian Sausage and a Chocolate Cake Shake. You cannot find the chocolate cake shake anywhere else so I would recommend it. They put a slice of chocolate cake into a blender and blend it up into the milkshake!

I love that they have a Barnelli&#39;s Pasta Bowl attached but unfortunately, my BF and I didn&#39;t go with the Barnelli&#39;s offering on our trip. 

We went after not being fulfilled at a Vietnamese restaurant across the street and just wanted to grab a quick bite in order to make it to the movies on time. Too bad the drive through was sooo backed up that you could barely turn in from the street. Inside was considerably less crowded and I attribute that to the raining buckets weather. My BF and I ordered. I got cheese fries and a chocolate cake slice, he got a hot dog with Ketchup, Mustard, and sport peppers (he&#39;s not a Chicago style dog guy :( ), fries, and a soda. Anyway, there were 31 employees in the Portillo&#39;s kitchen, which really impressed me with everyone working harmoniously in such close quarters, BUT we saw people who ordered way after us get there food ahead of us over and over as our bag (had our order number on it) sat under the fry heat lamps while my cake and bf&#39;s soda sat on a tray waiting. After 15 minutes of staring, finally, I see the manager yell to put our bag on the tray. We are thankful and race to the car to eat and drive to the movies. 

Sadly, the hot dog my bf got was either made incorrectly or not meant to be his dog and had onions (GROSS!) with no hot peppers. He scarfed it down anyway because we were both hungry and in a hurry. The chocolate cake was good but I think the slice was smaller than other Portillo&#39;s slices but the fries were downright awful. Obviously the fry bin left overs as they were all tiny little scrimpy fries and were so dried out that they were hollow, YES- hollow. I was quite sad. 

So because of this, I can only give this place 3 stars. If I were in the area, I&#39;d go back on a less busy day or just go straight to the Barnelli&#39;s side."

Portillo&#39;s is the place that people from the Chicago burbs long for when they travel. Seriously, I did an internship in Ohio one summer and I would talk about Portillo&#39;s with the one other person from the Chicago area. So good.

This location is the best for several reasons:
-There&#39;s a Barnelli&#39;s pasta bowl attached, which has a great rigatoni a la vodka. Also, the ceasar salad. I love this salad. So. Much.
-They use real dishes (at Barnelli&#39;s) and give you a small side of bread with pastas and salads. They switched to a quarter loaf, but will usually give you two if you ask.
-The Portillo&#39;s side is delicious also. The best hamburgers and fries ever. Really good.
-I kinda love how crazy the decor is. Love the 20&#39;s theme. When I was a kid, I was really scared of the mannequin in the phone booth. Still weird, but now I miss it when I go to other Portillo&#39;s."

Their chocolate cake is so moist but the frosting is way too sweet, and their strawberry shortcake.....well that was just disappointing. They used watered down strawberry jam....ugh!

On the plus side Portillo&#39;s uses excellent quality ingredients and doesn&#39;t skimp, their standard recipe are very solid as well. The downside to Portillo&#39;s is that the meal is generally more expensive than most Chicago style fast food places, and perhaps more importantly, because of the large number of employees that work in an average day, things are made slightly differently from person to person.

Moving on to the basics of Portillos, I&#39;m going to go over two items. Their standard Hot Dog and Jumbo hot dog. The stock portillo&#39;s hot dog is thin and has a nice flavor, it generally has all the juices intact after cooking. How they&#39;re prepared varies greatly, I&#39;ve seen hot dogs with just the right amount of mustard, relish and onion. I&#39;ve also seen hot dogs with too much mustard, (or too little), too much relish (or too little) and every combination in-between. This leads to Portilo&#39;s visits often being a gamble if you want a great hot dog. Usually you get a good one, but often times you get one that&#39;s just a little off. I&#39;m also not a fan of the giant pickle slice they include as it unbalances the hot dog flavor just a smidge. The jumbo hot dog suffers similar issues with condiment application, but is quite a bit thicker and the extra beef can balance out an over-saturated with mustard hot dog.

As far as their other menu items their burgers, Maxwell street polish&#39;s and fries are usually good, and have the tendency to be great, but it&#39;s a bit of a gamble.

Portillo&#39;s is a place capable of making five star food, but you don&#39;t get that experience every time. That&#39;s why I rate it four stars."

I live in the area and wanted to stop in for a quick drink and some food. Let me start out by saying, most of the items in this place are fried, and the best menu items are the burgers, pizza, and salad.

I was drinking Johny black on the rocks. At $10 a drink, this isn&#39;t bad. The waitress was attentive and funny. We got chicken wings and fried mushrooms for appetizers. I&#39;m okay with the fried mushrooms since most are frozen and all taste the same, but the chicken wings were fried with a breading and tasted very plain and lacked meat and flavor. They need some blue cheese dressing at least and not the typical franks red hot sauce.

I got the steak salad which has thick slices of steak and balsamic glaze with oil. Overall this was good for a salad. My gf got the chicken and vegetable soup which was just so-so. She also got the tuna salad sandwich. The fries were cold and the bread was stale white bread when she asked for wheat. 

Overall, this place is a neighborhood bar for locals and doesn&#39;t sit a lot of people. It is kind of hidden in the forest so be sure to keep an eye for it when on York road. I would recommend going for a drink since the service is good but if you are going to eat, stick to the pizza, burgers, and salads."

We found this place off the beaten path due to being somewhat close to our hotel. Missed the entrance due to less than zero signage to bring people in.

Outside looks good enough but the inside is another story. The space is incredibly cramped and the ceilings are so low that you feel claustrophobic.

It was the two of us and then like 12 or so locals. They were so loud that we couldn&#39;t hear ourselves talk from across the room. After sitting and looking around for 15minutes, a server finally came by, threw coasters at us, and sternly said &#34;What do you want?!&#34;.

After that, while I&#39;m a big fan of strong drinks, my fruity cocktail was basically straight up chilled rum which wasn&#39;t what I was looking for at the time. My friends drink had lipstick on it and was told that it&#39;s fine because it was washed. Never once checked on and had to go to the bar to pay our tab after sitting there for another 15minutes. 

The best part about the entire experience was the oddly newly renovated bathroom"

Pretty much the same as what other folks have said.  Small. Tavern. Casual. Burgers.

It&#39;s a great place to stop after a walk in nearby Fullersburg woods, which is what me and 4 girlfriends did after our 5K Walk for Autism Speaks. The space is small and you will end up jutting someone in the back (I did say I was sorry) when you try to scoot your chair back.  The bar space looks a little bigger, but they pack those bar stools pretty close together too.  

It&#39;s not kid friendly although my son did like his grilled cheese and I suspect it&#39;s not the place for kids after 5pm. 

Anyway, my burger was good and our server kept our sodas and waters refilled. They forgot to put in my friends order of mushrooms but she admitted to her own mistake and I totally respect her for owning up to it and not blaming it on the kitchen.

It&#39;s a historic farmhouse, in business over 150 years and really cute inside. It&#39;s also small and the dining room is a bit cramped. The tables are close together and I had to ask the &#34;Brasky buddy&#34; type guy sitting behind me to scoot in so I could sit down. It&#39;s also sports-heavy -- makes sense, Coach Q (Joel Quenneville, the Blackhawks coach) lives nearby and I know that the Stanley Cup has made a few appearances here.

The menu covers pizza, pasta, burgers, a few sandwiches and salads, and specials. It is mostly fried or carb-heavy stuff, but it&#39;s a bar, so hey. We started with mozzarella sticks, which were served in a basket with styrofoam plates - they were good, but pretty standard issue frozen stuff, nothing fancy.

Husband had chicken fingers, I had fish and chips. The fries were also the standard frozen-to-fried stuff, not bad, but not fancy. He said his chicken fingers were very good, and my fish was tasty and hot although not quite as crispy as I might have liked.

I love the history of the place and the cozy feel. And it&#39;s inexpensive, especially given the area you&#39;re in, million-dollar Oak Brook houses nearby and all. 

But I will say I was hoping for a bit fresher and more interesting food - hand-cut fries? Fancy mozzarella sticks? Real plates? I think I need to try the pizza; that seems to be their specialty. 

I&#39;m guessing this is primarily a bar that just happens to serve dinner. So in that vein it serves its purpose well. But hey, maybe charge 25 or 50 cents more and get some better fries. This is Oak Brook/Hinsdale, I&#39;m sure the locals can afford it."

So we told the waitress to cancel everything that we were leaving. She told us to hold on then proceeded to make us wait another 5-10 minutes for the bartender to come over.

She offered expensive bottled water, but I said sparkling, and she filled from the tap. then gave a shot of sparkling at the end with a cynical smile. I asked for a burger with mushrooms. I got a cheddar ( I wasn&#39;t given a choice) burger with mushrooms that was greasier than a slider. The plastic eating utensils were awful. Took an Act of Barkeep consensus to change the TV to Sox/Cub game from a terminated golf match with interviews you could not here. Closed captioning was off. This place is and always was LOUD! Why they hire a soft spoken, broken English, secluded, barkeep could be for only 1 reason....cheap.
Buck&#39;s in Hodgkins, Kenny&#39;s in C&#39;side, and Irish times in B&#39;field much better food, service and people."

We both had a cheeseburger and fries. Really good burger fries weren&#39;t anything special. We had bloody Mary&#39;s which were also good. My only complaint was the service. We sat at the bar and the bartender ignored us. She even kept walking by. Didn&#39;t greet us or say I&#39;ll be right with you. I had to call her over.  I would guess 4-5 minutes went by before she started making our drinks. I had to ask for menu and call her over to place our order. Never spoke, never smiled. Not a good first impression."

Was looking for some soup and a beer while talking to a longtime client (which she thought was a perfect Friday lunch), and she thought that this would be a perfect spot. As you&#39;ll see, there were positives:

Pros: 1. Good minestrone soup, 2. Shiner Bock on tap (it&#39;s a hot beer right now, and all I&#39;ve seen on taps in the last few months, it&#39;s more of a given).3. Blackhawks coach Joel Quenneville enjoying a salad.

Cons: 1.Clientele that asks you to &#34;move so they can watch golf&#34;, even though we were watching it ourselves. 2. The waitress giving us one word answers - thought she was really busy, but her &#34;good side&#34; was set for regulars and the Coach. 3. If you have any disability, good luck in navigating the very thin aisles. Had a quick drink and left for home.

I came here with some friends after reading about this place and its historic 163 year old presence. My friends and I weren&#39;t dressed up, but we defo looked spiffy and the other bar patrons (all regulars) and staff certainly took note. Like we were fresh from Mars, we got an infinite number of stares, whispers, and hesitation from the bartender. Yes, we really do want a drink.

I went with a little Shiner Bock in an ice cold mug. The bartender was was friendly once we were able to order but my beer tasted like a penny. Perhaps the beer lines were in need of a little cleaning, or maybe it was the mug... either way, the one beer was enough for my taste buds and I chose not to finish it. 

The place serves your typical bar grub and smells like the Friday nights of my youth when my parents would, without fail, take us to an all you can eat fish fry. I could tell this is a place my Ps would LOVE. The food is all nominally priced and even though I just ate, and am a vegetarian, their pulled pork looked and smelled pretty greasy good. I was also pleasantly surprised to see the sign advertising their veggie burger. I&#39;d defo come back to give the burger a go and maybe allow the beer to have it&#39;s chance at redemption."

Bar food, very simple, the service could have definitely been better BUT I must say the place was crowded. Maybe this is the one place in the world you want to go where everybody knows your name, and they&#39;ll always be glad you came? lol Maybe? 

The place has about 20 tables max! The bar has chairs and those were also full. It had its charm, small and cozy.

Anyways, we tried the mozzarella sticks, they were ok, and the burger was good, not great but good. I must say that I was not expecting Styrofoam plates OR plastic utensils, which I had to grab myself since the waitress only came around twice; Once for the order and once for the payment!

Our friends RAVED about the place, so we decided to try it out. It was a Sunday afternoon and the place was packed- luckily we were seated right away - but one of the waitresses came up to us and told us that we&#39;d have to move if a larger party came in (ok, so mid-meal you&#39;re going to pickup all of our things and transport us to another table?) Luckily, that never happened.

Our waitress had little-no personality, but she served her purpose alright. The menu isn&#39;t large, but we found many things that we wanted to order. We went with breaded zucchini for an app, I had a grilled chicken sandwich, and the boyfriend had the ribs. We very much enjoyed all of our meal- the food really is quite good and piping hot!

Cons: very small parking lot, tables are a little close together (we could hear our &#39;neighbors&#39; entire conversation verbatim!) 

Pros: good prices, cozy bar, relaxed atmosphere, good food

Included in the pizza/beer package is a much needed oasis of grime; something natural for a bar, yet foreign in the prissy town of Oak Brook/Hinsdale. Honestly, I&#39;m surprised this tavern hasn&#39;t undergone a face lift as collateral for setting up shop. 

I am familiar with the York Tavern as only a safe refuge for pizza. My options for pizza are limited on this side of town, and I know better than to sacrifice my good sense on mediocrity just to get some. Even if it weren&#39;t just steps away from my eight hour daily imprisonment, I&#39;d still consider this my preferred choice for midday nourishment. My order of a small thin crust pizza with tomatoes and green peppers amounts to a manageable $14. 

While I cannot rave about the service, I also cannot rant. It&#39;s a bar, and I&#39;m able to order a pizza that exceeds the tasty level of most others. Not much else is required. When picking up the pizza, I can put a face to the voice I&#39;d heard on the phone, and they are just as pleasant and thankful for another customer to pack into the always crowded dining section.

Anyways, it&#39;s a tiny little dive &#34;tavern&#34; with great burgers she says...and that it was.  

FF a decade later and I find myself out in Hillside around lunchtime...burger on the brain and remember this little old bar off York road in a quaint forest preserve area next to Graue Mill...and thanks Carol K, in all these years i never even knew wtf Graue Mill was...an old Grist Mill, gotcha.

So it&#39;s obvi seen a face lift since coming here last and imo, still retains a homey holmes charm (only now minus the smoke stained walls) with its low ceiling, tight quarters and fairly comfy atmosphere (YT&#39;s profile states it is a sports bar which with only two tv&#39;s i&#39;d say that&#39;s a stretch)

Menu has increased slightly to more than just burgers, and the pizza a few of the patrons were eating looked pretty good.  But it was the burger I came for and it was still as good as I remember.  I&#39;ll liken this burger to one you might get at Hackney&#39;s (excellent) or Jury&#39;s (also excellent)...these old school places have a lock on how to capitalize in creating an excellent burger, i&#39;ll give them that."

Located on York Road by the historic Graue Mill (cir 1852)- this place is an institution as it is one of the oldest continuously operating businesses in Illinois.  Historians will tell you it opened in 1843 and I&#39;d have to say that up until its recent renovation- it looked,  felt and smelled like it inside!!!

But that was part of its quirky charm.  With only hamburgers and cheeseburgers on the menu, you didn&#39;t go there for haute cuisine.  You went to congratulate a co-worker, or commiserate a firing or just to get away for a couple of minutes.  You can&#39;t say you are going to the York Tavern without laughing apologetically and shrugging your shoulders.  There just aren&#39;t other bars like this in this neighborhood of million dollar plus homes and trendy bars.  That&#39;s the beauty of the York Tavern.

Recently the York Tavern underwent a renovation with a complete rebuild to bring its kitchens and bathrooms up to code.  It still looks the same from the outside- although on the inside- some of that quirky charm is gone. The burgers have also gotten a little fancier the prices a little higher, but it&#39;s still your basic beer and burger bar- although they have added a few more items to the menu.

Stop by and have a cold one.  And when you are done- wander over the creek to the Graue Mill to see one of the few functioning grist mills still left in the country.  Both are institutions in Illinois."

Its kind  of a small and cozy place but the vibe was good. awesome and attractive staff. the people that were in there were mostly families til the end of the night. They have a pretty decent selection on tab and on bottle plus they had a full bar so if beer isnt your thing they have hard alcohol too. I didnt get to try any food besides the wings but they were pretty good. Its a nice change of scenery from the normal places i go to. I can definitely see myself going back.

Check-out all the sites with reviews.  Went in this week at about 9:30 and sat for at least 5 minutes......had both servers make eye contact several times, serve tables around the wife and me but it was like we were invisible.  Local guy comes in and sits at table next to us and gets his beer served IMMEDIATELY!!  Don&#39;t waste your time if you aren&#39;t pals with the servers...they are snobs,(with no right to be) and rude.  Made sure I let them know (and the whole place) why we got-up and left (old man eating pizza said &#34;thank you for making your point&#34;  I only hope he left a miserable tip).  Went to Ryans in Brookfield......one guy working the entire bar and restaurant and they were more crowded than York Tavern.  The guy KILLED IT!!  Had no problem hammering him with a nice tip....especially after the ignorance of the waitresses at York!

All my friends from La Grange, La Grange Park, Westchester, Western Springs ....Nazareth and LT sports families, etc, are getting a copy of my review......all of them know it takes a lot to put me over the edge so I can 100% guarantee the York Tavern that they are losing money after the last several uncomfortable experiences i&#39;ve had and the icing on the cake this past Tuesday night.  Such a shame because the food isn&#39;t bad and I like the feel of the place. Fool me once, ok, fool me twice, i&#39;m irritated....ignore my wife and me the third time......DONE!!!

Spend your money at places like Kenny&#39;s, Palmer&#39;s and Ryan&#39;s......guaranteed friendly service from people who are happy to have you in their joint."

A unique place.  Northwoods ambiance in Oak Brook (who knew?).  Friendly, feisty waitresses!  

The beer is cold.  There is a good selection of brands.  The crowd can be fun and the waitstaff is attentive.

GO THERE FOR THE BURGERS!!!   If you are a connoisseur of hamburgers, this is a place you have to visit.  They are large,  fresh, and made to order.    

The rest of the menu is typical, deep fried bar food for the most part - it has it&#39;s place.  Try the chili.   
  
On the weekend, get a blue cheeze burger, a selection of appetizers, a cold Blue Moon...watch a ball game on TV,  and, well... does it really get any better?

Kid friendly, family kind of place in the afternoon... around happy hour time there can be a crowd.   At night, you join the regulars trading stories, jabs and friendly banter. 

Good joint to relax and kick back with your wife, girlfriend or buddies."

This was my family&#39;s first time to the legendary York Tavern. At 5 p.m. it was packed. OK. It happens. But then the staff walked by a dozen times before even recognizing that we were there. Then when my father inquired how long the wait the answer was &#34;when someone gets up and leaves.&#34; Really? I don&#39;t get that concept at all. **sarcasm** Did that mean 10 minutes or an hour we asked. &#34;When someone gets up and leaves&#34; was our answer. We decided to leave only to find our car blocked by an employee&#39;s car. When I returned to ask them to move so we could go, the sense of urgency was underwhelming. We managed to get out before they got there.

We ended up going to Weber Grill where we were welcomed, served by an outstanding wait staff and had a great meal. 

They say you only get one chance at a first impression. I doubt they&#39;ll get the second chance. Had the York Tavern staff been more welcoming, understanding and apologetic about the wait, this would have been a better outcome.

Unless you are willing to risk service, don&#39;t bother. Just a few miles up the road is a plethora of restaurants just waiting for your business. Give it to them. They deserve it."

I thought the burger was  mighty tasty, and I have to say, better than all the other &#34;gourmet&#34; over priced burgers I have had lately.  At least York Tavern asks you AND cooks your burger exactly how you want it.  Ahhhh medium rare - pinkish/redish, juicy and delicious....  The bun was fresh, not my favorite, but not bad - it held it all together.  The fries, were meh.  But hey, they are tavern fries.  Crowd was older, then some after work happy hours folks came in....Place is very loud.  Seriously, they had the music cranking and based on the looks of the crowd, they could have even cared less if there was music even playing.

They&#39;re trying to maintain that neighborhood atmosphere but it just doesn&#39;t cut it anymore for me. It is always jam packed..sometimes hard to find seating. Also, it is always very loud in there. So be prepared for that before you go in. The bar just isn&#39;t big enough to absorb all the noise. Adequate parking but it can get tight when it&#39;s very busy. I&#39;d give it a higher rating if it weren&#39;t for the couple of negatives I mentioned above. All in all, it is still worth checking out. I will always go back there when I&#39;m in the mood. It is situated in a historical area next to the old Graue Mill.

After speaking with locals from the area they said that this is a big problem at the York Tavern. All the servers and bartenders walk around with extremely poor attitudes.

You can get an indie brew here, watch a Cubs game, or sit on their spacious deck overlooking a field of trees.  They used to only have burgers, which made it kind of low on my list, as I&#39;m not a big burger freak.  But a couple of years ago, the owner of Roberto&#39;s restaurant in Elmhurst purchased the place, renovated it, and jazzed up the menu.  Now you can get a wide variety of good bar food, including some healthier choices such as a grilled tilapia or a chicken sandwich.  Another cool thing - it&#39;s about a half mile south of the Salt Creek Bike Trail, right at the edge of the west entrance to Bemis Woods.  Makes a great stop for a meal and a beer after the ride!"

I must say I have never been so disappointed in a franchise before. I drove up with 2 twelve year olds in the car only to watch the store manager (not an assistant, but THE STORE MANAGER) exit the store to smoke. Assuming he would go around the corner, he did not. Instead he stood right next to the door and proceeded to smoke. Unprofessional. 

A few minutes later I got out after talking with the kids and walked up. He saw me coming and didnt even open the door for me, just threw his smoke and waked inside. He washed his hands right? NOPE. He walked right behind the counter and took my order (which he got wrong). 

After taking my order he went back to the oven to cut pizzas. Keep in mind he still had not washed his hands. 7 minutes later ( &#34;Hot and Ready&#34; ) my &#34;cheese&#34; pizza came out of the oven. Too bad he gave me a pepperoni.. Remember he still had not washed his hands. 

He handed me the pizza, I asked him for napkins and he grumbled and said have a good day and handed me a minimal amount.

I went to this location after being denied a &#34;Hot and Ready&#34; deep dish at the Book Rd. location the other day. Since I was there today outside the &#34;Hot and Ready&#34; hours I was okay with placing an order; I had to run over to Ace Hardware next door anyway for something, and I figured it could be made then. 

On the door there&#39;s a big sign that says &#34;Deep! Deep! Dish $7&#34; so I was reasonably sure of the price. I went in and ordered. Then the man asked me &#34;Do you want two?&#34; 

Now, this confused me a bit, because Little Caesars has historically done a two-pizza deal (their slogan is even &#34;Pizza, pizza!&#34;) And in the case of the Deep! Deep! Dish I had seen a commercial with two four-piece square pizzas. So thinking that is what he meant, I said yes. Then he rung me up, and it was $15-some dollars. Whether this was willfully trying to confuse people or not, it was definitely not presented in a clear manner (and I did not need four pizzas). 

Their deep dish (Detroit style) is not as good as Jet&#39;s, but for $7 is definitely serviceable. Just make it clear how many you actually want before they ring you up!!"

The service has gotten progressively worse. A month ago, I called ahead of time to place an order for a deep dish pizza since I knew it would take longer than a thin crust. They said it was not necessary to call. So when I got there, I had to wait 10-15 min while they made one. Do you know how they could have avoided my wait time? By preparing the pizza when I called and asked them to.

Yesterday, I got to the store and the girl at the register asked what I&#39;d like. I told her a deep dish pepperoni pizza. She then fumbled with the cash register and went into the kitchen. Then she left the register and went outside. Someone else came back with her and they fumbled with the cash registers together. 5 minutes later, she asked what my order was again and punched it into the system this time. I timed it... it took them 15 minutes to make the pizza and get it into my hands (in addition to the 5 minute ordering time). 

What happened to the super fast service w/ little to no wait time? And during this service time, there was no communication b/t the cashier and me. When she was having cash register issues, she did not say anything to me. I had no idea what she was doing when she physically left the store. Then while I waited for my pizza, she never apologized for the long wait time or say it was on its way. She just continued chatting with her co-worker the whole time.

These teenagers need to be trained on how to provide good customer service."

I have been at this location a number of times and this time will prob. be the last.  The quality of pizza varies tremendously. As you can see from one of my pictures the pizza didn&#39;t have much cheese and had a huge bubble on a big slice.  I do feel sorry for the staff because it seems they are well under staffed.

What? Isn&#39;t it just dough butter and Parmesan cheese?  So I only ordered a pizza.  Tonight when I went there and ordered pizza and crazy bread I came home to find the crazy bread was half burnt and dry and most were hollow!  That&#39;s two strikes for this location and not baseball I will never go to this location again!  I will have to drive 5 minutes further from this store to go to a different one.  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s management or poor training of staff but this location makes the chain look bad!

I don&#39;t know when corporate is going to do something about this location. I&#39;ve lived in the area for 17 years and for the last 6-7 years it&#39;s awful. Forget the quality of the pizza, that&#39;s if you can get a pizza. The catch to little Cesar&#39;s is that it&#39;s hot and ready (between certain times). Never ever is it hot and ready here. At noon on football Sunday- nothing. 5pm during the week, not another customer in the store, Staff is chatting in back and I have to wait for a cheese and breadstick. Every time. Isn&#39;t that false advertising? I would never even think to ask for a deep dish lunch special that is suppose to be ready at lunch time- not happening either. There is a constant turn over in staff. I&#39;ve called to place my order in advance, only to go there and find out my order was still sitting by the phone!!! I live in the neighborhood next to this location and no one I know goes here any longer when it used to be pretty popular. At this point it needs to just go away no need for a place that never has what it&#39;s supposed to."

Pizza was overcooked to the point that it was hard as a rock. The bread sticks had been sitting in the heat box so long that the seasoning had melted into runny butter turning them into a soggy mess. I&#39;ve never walked in and gotten a &#34;Hot n&#39; Ready&#34; pizza here in under 10 minutes. Kinda defeats the idea of &#34;Hot n&#39; Ready&#34; if any other pizza chain can cook it from scratch in the same amount of time.

We were celebrating our anniversary, and boy did they treat us good! Tasty meats. We are both currently in meat comas. ;-) very attentive servers. Nice ambiance too.

A couple of reasons for 4 stars instead of 5:
- they have Coke products(yay!), but they serve them in a little teeny tiny glass bottle(boo), so no refills. 

- we kept getting skipped over with meats. They would be at the table behind us and skip us and go to the table next to us, or back around the other way. We never saw the filet mignon(but saw them go to nearby tables, despite our cards being flipped to green). 

-the bacon on the bacon wrapped chicken was raw. Not cooked at all. 

They were so kind though. They knew it was our anniversary and brought us a piece of dessert on the house! Yum! 


We will be back."

Unlike other Brazilian places, this is a new building with an abundance of natural daylight. You can see the kitchen too. Place was very clean, including the bathroom, and the wait staff was very attentive. 
The hostess however left me standing in front of her for a full five minutes, totally ignoring my existence, while she chatted with her friend loudly on her phone. This happened on October 26 at around 11:30am. Only one table was occupied in the entire restaurant. It was not until my husband, who had to park and finish a phone call, walked in, surprised that I was still standing in front of the woman who was pretending I was invisible. He demanded for someone to attend to us so a man from the back of the restaurant ran to the front to quickly seat us. Let me mention that the lady did not bat an eye and continued her personal call - apparently she still does not see or hear us. Sigh... thumbs down already. 
Other than that, the food layout was great and the meats were perfection. One minor thing was that the bacon was overly sweetened and the butternut squash soup was also too sweet. 
We will cone back again someday and hopefully there will be a hostess with better work ethics even though it is midweek with slow business."

Ambience... I&#39;m surprise, a little homey and modern so we love it. Tables are too close with each other tho that I could hear the conversation from the next table.

Service.. Can&#39;t complain. Our waiter was Sergio and he rocks!  Only if all waiters are like him then we will all be happy but at the same time,  we got Jackie who was awesome too and never fail to ask abt anything or everything.. From how&#39;s your meat to anything else u want or clean plates? Even took a couple of pictures for us. 

Drinks.. Our sangria was awesome.. Maybe Bec we told Sergio how we want it and came out perfect. So far,  best sangria compare to chama and Texas DE Brazil. He also separated the ice from the pitcher so we ended up having more of the perfect sangria. 

Meat and the servers... Some meat are chewy so we stayed with our basics., picanha,  beef ribs,  lamb chops and garlic beef. Took a while for my medium picanha to come and longer wait for wifey Bec she prefers medium well. Most people in Naperville location likes their meat rare or medium rare. Beef ribs guy don&#39;t seem to walk around and had to be specially requested. They give big portion of meat even if u don&#39;t ask.  I think it&#39;s a waste of food Bec it ended up hoarding my plate. Servers seemed to be out of touch with the meat they have except our picanha and beef ribs guys.  They made sure that the meat we get is right.  The rest just cut it and put it in your plate.  Our lamb chops guys finally caught up and paid attention more later part of the evening. 

It&#39;s a nice place and enjoyed our food just because of Sergio and Jackie and the ambience. We will come back again if given the time.  I only rate it 3 stars instead of 4 or 5 is because the servers and their meat needs to be consistent.  Servers need to pay more attention and take their time to know the meat and how it is.  Some meat are burnt and raw inside."

I&#39;m definitely not saying the food was bad, because it wasn&#39;t. I just had a different idea in my mind of what a steakhouse was. It wasn&#39;t bad, it just wasn&#39;t for me. I felt like I was getting samples of meat when what I wanted was a 10-16oz ribeye. The meats I  tasted were very good, but I was left wanting more.

I hated that, because of a high school graduation, we were on a rushed time schedule and that is no fault of the restaurant. We just couldn&#39;t seem to get the meat over to our table fast enough. We were a table of 8 and only had one server at a time, and felt like we were under served.

1) Fogo de Chao is the first Brazillian Steakhouse I have ever been to. THERE. I said it.
2) I have been to said Fogo de Chao 3 times in the last month. :::pause for reaction/applause:::

Phew. I feel much better now. Moving on...

I have loved everything about my experiences at the Fogo de Chao in Naperville. The service is what stands out greatly to me. Everyone is so knowledgeable about everything -- the cocktails, the meats, the history of the restaurant. It&#39;s great. Drinks are always flowing, and the second you flip that card to green, you best believe meat will be at your side.

Before diving into the carne, we indulged in the market table which has all different salads, meats, cheese, soup, etc. I have to say, the peppered bacon they offer is amazeballs! It was hard not to just eat a whole plate of that. I could honestly make a meal just out of the market table, but if you plan to dive into the full meat tasting experience, I would definitely suggest going on the light side.

As for the main show, I&#39;d like to say I&#39;ve tried every meat they offer by now, but it&#39;s hard to say if that&#39;s true. I believe they have like 17 different options, so I&#39;d be pretty impressed with myself if I&#39;ve done the full tour de meat. I honestly loved almost everything I tried, but the favorites that stick out in my mind are the bacon wrapped chicken, house sirloin, and pork. Yum!

To accompany the rotating meats, your table is given garlic mashed potatoes, crispy fried polenta, caramelized bananas, and rolls. The polenta and rolls are amazing. I thought the mashed potatoes were kind of bland, and the caramelized bananas just aren&#39;t my thing so I can&#39;t comment on that.

If you happen to have any room left after all that (or even if you don&#39;t), I suggest browsing their large dessert menu. I&#39;ve had the chocolate fudge cake and strawberry cheesecake and both were delicious.

Of course with all this eating, you better believe I had a cocktail to wash it down. The Caipirinha they offer is my favorite. It&#39;s so refreshing. They also have a good wine selection and the servers are helpful when it comes to pairing your vino with the meat.

I know Fogo offers different dining options to choose from (lunch menu, one meat option, etc.), but I&#39;ve always just done the full Churrasco experience. Go big or go home, right?"

This freestanding jewel box of a restaurant joins other upscale establishments in Naperville for the upper middle class business people who live and work around the area. 

The theme here is a fancy buffet with a Brazilian meat and side dishes. I started out with a Carmelized Pineapple Manhattan. Pretty good, I&#39;d give it, although just a little sweet. 

Head over to the market table which is a full fledged salad bar with all of the special fixings, including hearts of palm and artichoke, marinated onions and mushrooms, chicken salad, beets, shaved parmesan di reggiano, salumi, and asparagus. Also on the side table were a meat, sweet spicy bacon, and cheese board, side dishes of black beans and rice, and a serve yourself soup of the day which was a delicious butternut squash bisque. I tried the house cocktail caipirinha, but this was definitely too sweet for me.

Head to your table and use your &#34;stop&#34; and &#34;go&#34; coasters to signal the roving gauchos with long forked skewers of all types of meat: bacon wrapped chicken, leg of lamb, lamb chops, garlic beef, sirloin steak, ribeye steak, rump roast, filet mignon, and my favorite, bacon-wrapped filet mignon. The table also features fresh mini popovers, garlic mashed potatoes, fried plantains, and crispy polenta fries.

Eat and repeat until you&#39;re stuffed.

Then save room for desserts. The tres leches cakes, chocolate fudge cakes, strawberry cheesecakes and key lime pies are tops. Coffee is great too!

Service is professional, moving plates and replacing them quickly. This place is a carnivore&#39;s dream. However, if you might prefer just the salad bar, this is also available as a separate item.

Try it for lunch for a smaller overall bill. I&#39;m mostly vegan-- until you parade all this tempting meat before me, then I become caveman."
fogo-de-chão-brazilian-steakhouse-naperville-6,Jim C.,f9vgEbr_EBssbSYbHi7NXg,"Naperville, IL",1,1,1,95,419,WeXjfGfIVLo5bAd9E1r7qQ,5.0,2016-03-01,"I have wanted to go to Fogo de Chao since it opened in Chicago. For many reasons, it never worked out. And although I have been to a few other Brazilian steakhouses, Fogo felt to me like the one I most wanted to visit. So last night&#39;s Elite event was a dream come true for me. 

The better news - by far - was that Fogo lived up to its reputation and my dreams. 

First, the people that work there. Tony the manager was friendly, funny and welcoming. The wait staff were helpful and happy and the vibe was similar to that I&#39;ve experienced on a cruise ship at dinnertime. Happy staff, happy customers, music, drinks and unusual and interesting food. 

As for the food itself, the Market Table (as they call their grandiose salad bar), is amazing in its variety of colors, food types, locales from which the food is sourced and in its presentation. On the Market Table was Caesar salad, spinach salad, marinated mushrooms, olives of every kind, house-roasted red and yellow peppers, peppadew peppers, prosciutto, parmagiano reggiano cheese in a big ass wheel of cheese, smoked salman with capers, crispy bacon, imported manchego cheese wedges, jalapeños, onions, pineapple, watermelon, and on and on and on. Plus soup, black beans and rice. Honestly, you could easily make a great meal on the Market Table alone. So if you go with a vegetarian, opt for that and you&#39;ll both be happy!

The gauchos were all over us with their assortment of roasted chicken, parmesan crusted chicken, lamb, steaks of every variety (my fave being the house special and the filet mignon) and pork dishes. Each of the meats were perfectly cooked to specification and it was fun taking the meat off the skewers with the little tongs. Also served with the meats were four different sauces. I tried the mint jelly on the lamb (loved it and I do not normally like mint jelly), the Chimichurri sauce (also on point) and the horseradish  sauce (could have used a but of a bump of horseradish in the sauce).

Surprisingly, the star of the show for me was dessert. Now maybe it was because I was so &#34;meated out&#34; that I needed a break, but the Tres Leches cake was so moist and flavorful that I wanted to shrink myself down to the size of a crumb so I could jump into the cake and live there for the rest of the night. It was that good, especially with the coffee they served up.

Fogo de Chao is a place to go to with people you love and with whom you wanna chill and enjoy and talk and laugh and indulge. If you&#39;re feeling it then do it. It&#39;s totally worth it!j"

I have always really enjoyed Texas de Brazil but feel Fogo can hold its own against Texas De Brazil. Texas De Brazil has a larger selection on the salad bar but Fogo De Chao has a bigger meat selection. I also really like that the Salad bar was well maintained at FoGo De Chao. They had people constantly checking the food to make sure it is presentable and that things didn&#39;t run out. When something did run out it was replenished quickly. The service here is also very friendly and patient. I like to enjoy my dinner and hate being rushed and never felt that way here. The steak was very good and my plate wasn&#39;t ever empty. Lots of great selections to choose from. Over all a great experience I will be back for more :)

It was our first time at any Fogo de Chao location as well as any kind of Brazilian steakhouse. Luckily a friend had given me a heads up on the style of how this place works before I got there so I was prepared to know a LOT of food was coming!

To start: we had their signature cocktail caipirinha (which is as fun to say as it looks!) -- I really loved it. It was light and refreshing. Highly recommend you try it! I also had a passionate caipirinha (with passion fruit juice), which was sweeter but still tasty for me! It was so nice to see a chain restaurant putting in the effort of freshly muddling fruit for their specialty drinks.

When we got to our table we were kindly guided to the Market Place -- which has plenty of vegetables, salads, cheeses, and an abundance of other things. I had some caesar salad, parmesan cheese, mozzarella cheese, salami, prosciutto, and olives. Clearly I went with my Italian antipasti favorites here. But there were plenty of other options!

When we sat down the meats began coming. We flipped our chips to green (aka &#34;YES bring me meats please!&#34;) and the party started. Pork sausage, plenty of beef, chicken...we had meats for days. Our favorites stood out: primarily the garlic beef (don&#39;t miss this one! flavorful, melt in your mouth, so tasty!) and a very thin cut of beef -- a sirloin of sorts (they have at least 3 on their menu) -- that was served rare and delicious. 

Service was overwhelmingly awesome. Many people at all times were serving food and able to get anything we needed. They were also very friendly and knowledgable, telling us the history of the restaurant and sharing telling us about the meats as they served them.

We wrapped up the night with dessert - chocolate lava cake and their caramelized pineapple. A bit of a let down but I would give some other desserts a try. The best part were the glasses of wine that polished off the meal! That was the real treat to wrap up this intense meal!

Welcome to Naperville, Fogo de Chao!

We did not know how the pick-one-meat option worked. Unfortunately, it is not available on the weekends. Our waiter explained to us (and I think he wasn&#39;t even that sure) that you can pick one meat and get 9 ounces of that meat plus all-access to the market table for a lower price than the all-you-can-eat. He did not know the exact price, but I think it would be a nice option to try during the week. 

Our lunch was pretty good. Our server was attentive. Everything on the market table was fresh and delicious. The butternut squash soup and the salmon stood out for me. The meats were a bit overcooked for my liking, and no one offered to bring any other different temperatures of meat. This place has just opened, so I am definitely giving the Gauchos the benefit of the doubt that these kinks will be worked out at lunch service. That was a bit disappointing, but the food was still tasty. 

My experience at dinner service at the Yelp event was above and beyond and absolutely amazing (see my previous review). I hope to definitely visit again for dinner service with my husband. I believe that we will have a great time."

Market bar was great. Wish I would have had more smoked salmon but I was too stuffed on the meats...

Oh, the meats. Delicious lamb, pork, and beef. Paired with garlic mashed potatoes brought to the table - heaven! 

Decent prices for lunch as well! My husband and I will be back!"

The location of this establishment was a little hidden, definitely needed GPS to find it since it was located off a small street. There weren&#39;t huge signs offering the location and quite frankly it was blocked by all the hotels. With that said. There was plenty of parking, though most of the spots right outside the front door was either handicap or valet.  I suppose this is a suburb thing. Not that I am complaining I need to walk an extra 15 ft from my car to a beautiful meal, but it had started to drizzle when I was walking in. I guess I&#39;m just used to the city life where it is all about cab to front door.

When you walk in, you are warmly greeted by the hostess,  follow by an impressive high wall of wine, and the bar next to it. There are two giant barrels on the wall. They were for decorations and does not actually pour out wine. But you&#39;re more than welcome to play with the fixture. The center of the dining room is where the salad bar/market table resides. It&#39;s a beautiful and delicious buffet of delicious goodness. I highly recommend the apple salad. It looks kinda dull, white, and creamy. But it is an explosion of flavor in your mouth. The smoked salmon and capers were melt in your mouth smokey goodness. Hearts of Palm was mild, delicate in flavor, and had a nice texture. If you&#39;ve ever had artichoke or bamboo,  it has the same texture. I wasn&#39;t a fan of the asparagus,  as it was kind of on the wilted/overcooked side. There was a heirlooms grape tomatoes, mozzarella,  and basil salad. It was delicious.  Perfectly balance with the acidity from the tomatoes to compliment the complexity of the mozzarella.  The basil and dressing just brings the flavors together.  Seriously. Try a bite of everything.  You&#39;d be surprised at what you might like since there are many options of charcuterie, fruits, salads, and soups.

I know they advertise a grand selection of mixed drinks to compliment your meal. I&#39;m kind of an old fashioned gal, therefore I paired my meats with a glass of 2013 cabernet sauvignon. I don&#39;t recall which winery it came from, but it was good. 

We had three sides, the garlic mash, caramelize bananas,  and polenta.  The garlic mash potatoes was pretty standard.  I wasn&#39;t overly impressed.  The caramelized bananas were a little on the soft side. I think I was expecting a crisp to it, kind of like the top of a creme Brule.  The polenta.  My god. It is shaped into a french fry. Deep fried. Then tossed in freshly grated parmesan cheese. 

CORDEIRO: the leg of lamb was succulent, well seasoned, and while it had that gamey flavor,  it wasn&#39;t too overwhelmingly gamey. Definitely a must try if you&#39;ve never had lamb. 

COSTELA DE PORCO: the pork ribs with a slice of lime. I wasn&#39;t too overly impressed with it. There was very little meat and the 3 pieces I&#39;ve had from 3 different times of the meal was very dry and salty. 

FRANGO: chicken leg wrapped in bacon, the leg was juicy and the meat itself was well flavored by the seasoning and bacon. Only complaint is the bone. I think it&#39;s the way they prep it. I found little crushed bone shards on the meat. It&#39;s probably unavoidable but if you have an aversion to crushed bone in your meat. You&#39;ve been warned.  

LOMBO: pork loin... unimpressive. 

LINGUIÇA: pork sausage has a slow heat/burn if you like spicy meat. The skin definitely has a snap to it. It was a one bite wonder for me. 

There was a lamb chop floating around. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s on their regular menu. I love lamb chops and fogo de chao really nailed it.

PICANHA: the house steak. This was delicious, tender, some parts were saltier than others, but I had 2nds, 3rds, and possibly even a 4th serving.

FILET MIGNON: wrapped in bacon. Basically anything wrapped in bacon tastes good. My only complaint is that I had asked for medium rare, but the 2 pieces  presented to me were all well done. While it is still tender, moist,  and flavorful. Who eats well done filet mignon?

BEEF ANCHO: the ribeye... oh man... that marbling.  The robust flavors.  Definitely a must try. Although,  same complaint. I was served a well done piece when I asked for medium rare. It took a couple of attempts,  but we finally got there. 

FRALDINHA: bottom sirloin. There was nothing bottom about this piece. It was tasty, melt in your mouth goodness.  It was the only cut that wasn&#39;t well done every time they brought it over.

The Naperville location is much smaller than the downtown one, according to my friend cheryl. The salad bar had much less choice. However, it is totally enough for me. 
The best meat is definitely the lamb chop. I also like some beef but don&#39;t remember its name. It is near Tbone area."

We had dinner here on Monday, it is only now, on Friday that I am able to attempt the words needed to describe this place. The restaurant is new, clean, simple sophisticated style. But honestly I would sit in much uglier rooms to experience their deliciousness. The manager explained the process to our group, he was very personable and helpful. The staff was very attentive, aside from having to order our drinks twice, it was flawless. They were attentive without being pushy, they replaced dirty plates in seconds, and I don&#39;t think there was ever more than 2 inches missing from my water glass all night. 
We had the full Churrasco experience ($50, and drink menu drinks were $14). We started our meal with a trip to the market table (a fancy phrase for salad bar). Cheeses, fruits, apple salad, peppered bacon, artichoke salad, salmon, Caprese salad, fresh green beans, all delicious.  Side dishes are served family style and are garlic mashed, crispy fried polenta, and carmelized bananas, and rolls. All better than average. The rolls reminded me of a popover, light and airy with parmesan inside, served warm, outstanding.  But do not fill up on the salad bar and sides, there is a literal meat parade heading your way.
Oooooo that meat.  I simply cannot say enough good things about it. Various preparations of filet, chicken, lamb, pork. I would say I tried at least 10 different items. My personal favorite by far was the house specialty Picanha, it&#39;s a mouth watering sirloin seasoned with rock salt and cooked to perfection. I would still be gushing if that&#39;s all they served. After eating to the breaking point and admittedly meat drunk.... they brought out dessert. That consisted of average cheesecake, average tres leches cake, very rich and delightful chocolate mousse cake, and a very memorable key lime pie.
I cannot wait to come back and share my new found love for Fogo de Chao with my family."

These types of places are known for their exceptional service, and most importantly, delicious food. There&#39;s no exception here.

We were greeted and seated almost immediately on a Friday night, and got a nice table for two near the entrance with a view of the whole establishment. The decor is hotel chic - elegant and modern, but simple and quite cold. Luckily I&#39;m not here for the decor, and my husband and I immediately made our way up to the salad-y station in the center of the restaurant. SUCH a nicer selection than Chauma Gaucha in Downers Grove! Fresh veggies, delectable cheeses, a huge Parmesan wheel, fresh mozz balls, a mountain of peppered bacon, endless piles of smoked salmon, capers, OMG. The works. I resisted for the most part because let&#39;s be real, you&#39;re there for the meat, but what a tempting a delicious display!

Once we flipped our table cards to &#34;green,&#34; it was on. The Gauchos flood your table with all sorts of incredible selections - from bacon wrapped chicken to leg of lamb to pork sausages to strip steak. All of the Gauchos were incredibly polite and very patient as I awkwardly used the provided tongs to grab my selections. My favorites were the lamb chops and leg of lamb - moist, tender, cooked to perfection. These gauchos were good, too. Once I had my card flipped to red, and I must have been eyeing a selection rather longingly, because he stopped by and offered me some even though my table card was turned over. They seemed thoughtful in their execution, which was nice.

For dessert, I got the flan, which was ordinary but still delicious. We left appropriately stuffed, and with a coupon for a free meal next time - score!

I would have given this place 5 stars, but two managers were viciously whispering to one another about a colleague right next to our table for a significant amount of time, and it really turned me off. They would have filleted (no pun intended, ha!) a staff member for that, so why did they do it?! When they caught me staring at their loud, animated conversation, they took it down a notch, but didn&#39;t walk away or stop. Super annoying buzzkill."

It wasn&#39;t busy when we arrived but packed when we left! This location is pretty small so I am guessing it&#39;ll be busy on the weekends. They have complimentary coat check also and a small bar in the front. 

Market table seemed to have less than the Chicago location, but our server said it didn&#39;t. Food was delicious as always. The service was top notch, I&#39;m hoping it stays like that even after it&#39;s been open awhile. Soda is in bottles so you are charged for each one which is a pain. My only other complaint was that we had so many people serving us that no one ever dropped off the check so we had to ask for it. If you sign up for their emails you&#39;ll get $25 off lunch Monday-Friday which was awesome. I took off one star because it&#39;s still really pricey for lunch.

Visited for the first time during the week for dinner and loved it. I have been to other Brazilian steakhouses before, but this one is by far the best - from quality of food to service.

The service was fabulous - the servers who walked around with meat were very accommodating. I am expecting and cannot have rare meat. When my card was flipped to green and a server came around with rare meat, I&#39;d ask for well done and they&#39;d return promptly.

The salad bar had a really nice variety. I really enjoyed all of the different cheeses and the roasted zucchini. There is something for everyone.

fogo-de-chão-brazilian-steakhouse-naperville-6,Joshua N.,8fuigXbDDCE0JIDIpRG5Lg,"Berwyn, IL",1,1,1,30,13,ez1QMNcwtg0ioWWegagTfw,4.0,2016-03-01,"This is a newer location of the Fogo de Chão churrascaria (Brazilian steakhouse) concept full-service restaurant, known for their premium southern Brazil-themed high-protein dining experience.

And let&#39;s right up front about this:   Fogo de Chão is definitely an experience.   If you enjoy eating meat, and appreciate very attentive service, you will not leave disappointed.   However, you will leave with a much lighter wallet -- and you may be too full of delicious meat, savory sides, and premium cocktails to leave under your own power.    

The experience:

DRINKS:   The premium table-side service starts immediately, with an array of drink options presented by knowledgeable servers.   I was very impressed with the Cabernet Sauvignon I was served, which was way better than the usual house wine served at most restaurants (even fancier ones).    The seasonal Caramelized Pineapple Old Fashioned was a crowd pleaser with my dining companions; a complicated drink with cherry flavor as the standout.   I also enjoyed the highly-recommended Caipirinha (the &#34;national drink of Brazil&#34;),  which was very sweet (but not too sweet) and refreshing.   My other dining companions enjoyed other wines and cocktails, all of them good.

MARKET TABLE:   The salad bar and soup table are referred to as the &#34;Market Table,&#34; and you could easily make a nice meal with it alone.   The salad area of the Market Table had both ordinary salad ingredients but also exceptional vegetables, such as marinated mushrooms, hearts of palm, and really good pre-made salads.   And even the salad bar here has exceptional meats!    The smoked salmon (a cold cure with a strong smokey flavor) was excellent.   And the imported salami was honestly the very best I&#39;ve ever had.

Also notable at the Market Table is the feijoada bar.   On the evening of my dinner the feijoada was a black bean soup, and it tasted perfect on its own.   But wait... don&#39;t eat it yet!  Be sure to add:  black pepper bacon, hot sauce, and yucca powder with (no joke) ground bacon!   In spite of management warnings to not fill up at the Market Table, I made multiple trips.

SIDES:    The garlic mashed potatoes were nice,but not extraordinary.   Same with the polenta fries.   The carmelized bananas were very good.    The cheesy rolls were nice enough, but obviously we didn&#39;t want to fill up on those!

CHURRASCO:   And now on to the star of the show:  meat service!    As with most true churrascarias, the staff at Fogo de Chão who bring skewers of meat to your table are also the same ones who prepare it in the kitchen.    I really enjoy this merging of the waiter/cook role at a restaurant, and wish it was more common.   It&#39;s a real treat being served food by the person who prepared it, benefiting from their immediate knowledge and experience.

Here (as best I can remember) are some of the meats I enjoyed tableside:

 * Picanha (prime top sirloin):    Very good all-around

 * Filet Mignon:   I normally hate this cut in other restaurnts, but at Fogo it has a more robust flavor.

 * Beef Ancho:  Not as good as the Alcatra, but sitll and excellent ribeye.

 * Alcatra (top sirloin):   Arguably the best steak they serve.   Tastes like concentrated ribeye.   This was the most popular cut at my large table.

 * Fraldinha (bottom sirloin)

 * Costela (ribs):   This comes to the table as beef and pork ribs.    The beef ribs never made it to my table (the only mishap in service I experienced the entire meal), but I did get to enjoy the pork ribs.   Perfectly prepared, with the fat rendered just right, and no gristle.

 * Cordeiro (lamb):  This comes to the table as either lamb chops or leg of lamb.   The leg of lamb version of the Cordeiro was my absolute favorite meat of the night!   Perfect pepper finish.   (The little lamb chops were also good, but not as amazing as the lamb leg.)

 * Frango (chicken):   Delicious, but not especially exceptional.   May have been my least favorite protein of the meal.

 * Lombo (pork loin)

 * Linguiça (squeaky pork sausage):   Brought out right after the appetizers, this intro to our meat course blew me away!    May be the best linguiça I&#39;ve ever had.    

My only criticism of the meats is a small one:  Most of the cuts were too salty.   I observed this over and over again, and it surprised me.   Only the leg of lamb, the sausage, the picanha, and the Alcatra avoided this.    I also thought the chicken could be improved.

DESERTS:    Fogo offers 16 different deserts, of which I tried four:  strawberry cheesecake, some kind of marshmallow chocolate cake, key lime pie, and tres leches.   All were quite good, but not as extraordinary as the meat service that preceded it.   And, c&#39;mon now, if you are hungry enough for desert at this point you are doing it wrong.

OVERALL IMPRESSION:    
  Service:  5 stars
  Bar:  5 stars
  Food: 4 stars
  Value: 4 stars
  Desert:  4 stars

For the price, I think it&#39;s all about quantity, and not about the quality of what they serve.

The ribs they served were quite chewy, the garlic steak was hard to cut, and some was very salty.  The filet and the parmesan pork was probably the best of what they were serving."

I was very disappointed by Fogo De Chao&#39;s market bar.  I kept thinking about the salad bar at Texas De Brazil, and there was really no comparison.  The au gratin potatoes at Texas De Brazil takes their salad bar over the top.  As far as the meats, almost every cut I tried needed salt...and I personally never salt anything.

fogo-de-chão-brazilian-steakhouse-naperville-6,Rebecca C.,Vv921iDdazUHJqPCBzJnUQ,"Chicago, IL",1,1,0,82,16,VTX-bsFPduEHRDTnN6CNtg,3.0,2016-05-31,"It&#39;s alright. It&#39;s pretty good. It&#39;s just not great like it used to be; back in the day when I was a kid, then a teenager, and my parents picked up the dinner check. Now that my hubby and I are usually in charge of the bill, I&#39;m seeing things in two different lights - then and now. This is my take. 

The Market Table for dinner, while good, is nowhere near as great as it was several years ago (even for lunch), at the downtown locale. Gone were the artichokes, gone were the shrimps, gone were the hearts of palm. In fact, at least 1/2 of the bar was gone. From the eye of a kid to the discerning eye of an adult, this was perhaps a move to exponentially increase revenue. While I have no problem with the wants of businesses to make money, the disappearance of so much is testament of marked restaurant inflation. On a positive note, it was nice to not have to be so careful not to fill up on salad so that we were too full to enjoy the meat. 

The sides are ho hum except for the fried plantains which are a nice touch that&#39;s not typically experienced outside a Cuban restaurant in Miami. The garlic mashed are okay and the fried polenta is a bit too deep fried for my palate. The rolls mimic Reel Clubs gluten free biscuits, which seem more appropriate for fish than meat. Not a big deal, most guests don&#39;t come there for the bread. 

Now for the meat. While tasty, I wasn&#39;t charmed, and neither was my hubby and the couple we were with. At least not the way I was when dining here with my parents. To be fair, the 4 of us liked our steak either medium rare (us), the other couple, medium to well done. Our waiter did a good job bringing out one rare, than one well done. However, when the other couple asked for the chicken breast wrapped in bacon, it took 2 asks for it to be brought out. Personally, I was more unenthused about the dried out chicken and overcooked bacon than anything, except that the chicken legs were uncharacteristically dry as well. The pork ribs were dull, but that was fine. The leg of lamb - meh. I remember all the meats being much tenderer and juicier than what we had and there was definitely the essence of salt in every bite, that wasn&#39;t nearly as noticeable before. The steak pieces were fine, they weren&#39;t spectacular. We thought the filet was their best, but the restaurant must not have agreed, because we couldn&#39;t get them to bring out more until when they finally did, we each had devoured more than enough meat.  

Next to the fried plantains, I&#39;m going to go with the key lime pie. While it&#39;s about $9.95 for a normal sized slice, it was delicious from the crust to the sauce on the plate. For $90 per person separate from our bar bill, this is not a stop-in-and-have-a-quick-supper-kinda-place. Now that I&#39;m paying for my own dinners, I expected more for my 90 bucks/180 for both of us."

She never came back, we waited for a bit and saw another couple walk in and instantly get seated who did not have reservations. We almost walked out because we got tired of waiting and noticed the hostess? Manger? Busy with other things.

That&#39;s fine, but we felt forgotten and would have appreciated being seated because of our reservations.

Maybe they were under staffed and it was an off night, but if she made the tiniest bit of effort to have us seated before other people with no reservation and never come back to get us (a waiter saw us waiting and finally seated us)

We would have been perfectly fine. We aren&#39;t generally negative people but that was disappointing.

We most likely won&#39;t be back.

They forgot about us again and didn&#39;t give us our check. It was very awkward seeing the host/manager right next to us laughing and being friendly with a bigger table when she ignored us. 

For half the price, the restaurant next to them is amazing, treats everyone nicely and the overall atmosphere is much fancier and more sanitary (our waiter was visibly stick)

If your service is going to be this bad, I suggest lowering your prices.


Service is everything, updating my review to mention nobody ever reached out to us. This is only one of two places we have been with bad service, everywhere else is amazing. I updated my review to a lower rating because no one reached out to us. We will be spreading the word.


Thanks."

Salad bar was extremely generic compared to other Brazilian steakhouses. Meats were just okay yet needed seasoning and we were only offered four types. Very expensive for the quality and the offerings.. 
Would much rather go to Texas de Brazil , they have a high end salad bar, top quality meats always perfectly seasoned and top-notch service. Sorry Fogo de Chao, won&#39;t be back."

Thank you Jacqueline for putting together a great event!  I was very excited  to try Fago de Chao since I am a big fan of Chama Gaucha in Downers Grove.  The restaurant had a lot of seating and a back area that was set up for the yelp group.  It has a bar when you walk in and a large market salad bar that also has soup.  There are so many things to try on the salad bar but be sure to save room for dinner because the meat is never ending. They bring out potatoes, polenta, fried bananas and of course the brazilian rolls that are so addicting!  That is my favorite thing at these restaurants!    In my opinion the 2 best cuts of meat were the house prime sirloin and the ribeye.  Between the two the ribeye was my favorite. The servers were very consistent and came by frequently with new meats to try.  There is a coin for each person at the table.  You flip the coin to green if you want the servers to stop with the meat or if you need a break you flip the coin to the red side. We were also given a drink.  I put my drink order in when I arrived but it must have gotten lost with them being so buisy with the event. I gave them about 15 minutes and then asked another server who apologized and brought the drink out quickly. I tried the Caipirinha.  I usually like fruitier not strong drinks.  This drink was good though and I was able to drink it.  We were also given desserts.  They gave us cheesecake, a tres leches cake, key lime pie and a chocolate type cake.  The key lime pie was way too much lime for me but I am not a big key lime pie person and the chocolate was too rich for me but the tres leche cake and cheesecake were amazing.  I would order those two again.  Although I don&#39;t know if I would have room for dessert next time we come back."

Good: Meat and the staff.

Bad: No Chimichurri sauce. That is like no Arby&#39;s sauce at Arbys, no salsa at your favorite Mexican restaurant, no... you get the point. The sides were cold and lacked favor. The Market Table had been picked through and no effort to replace it.

The other thing is the atmosphere. I find the style of the decor more to be for an elegant 5 start restaurant and not some Gaucho open fire steakhouse.

Anyway, it was special occasion that we were celebrating and it just wasn&#39;t a special meal, we left not wanting dessert. We went somewhere else for dessert and was spoiled at that place.

No more Fogo."

Reservation wait time - I hate to make a reservation ahead of time only to wait 45 minutes after arriving for a table. I guess I&#39;m not very patient / - ;   In this case, I was taken to my table 4 minutes after arrival (9 PM reservation).... Excellent 

Servers - The servers seemed to range from average to good as it relates to several areas
- Drink refills
- New plates when needed
- Rolls/Mash Potatoes /plantains 
- Providing asked for cuts of meat
- Time it took to provide selections
- Knowledge of cuts being served

Manager - Tony was the manager of hand that night and he was outstanding! My wife addressed with him some concern over the lack of meat being brought out to the table and he directly addressed this. Tony went above and beyond my expectations in addressing the issue and made sure we fully enjoyed our dinner experience. I cant express how much we appreciated his service as he truly embodies what it means to be a great Manager and changed this from a 3/4 star experience to a solid 5 star.

Final thoughts: Prior to my visit, Chama Gaucha in Downers Grove was my first choice in Brazilian Steakhouses. Having experienced Fogo de Chao of Naperville, I have to rethink that choice.."

After waiting 20 minutes for the food to come out we finally had to ask for a manager to find out why there was no food going around. He quickly went and grabbed us filet and came right back. Not 5 minutes later the entore resturant ran out of potatoes which is one of 3 sides they offer. Waiter never brought out our kids drinks.

Not at all impressed with this place. I liked Charma Gucha in Oak Brook 10 times better. More expensive here, food not ready/cooked/warm. I mean its not horrible but for as expensive it is, its rediculous."

Decor is pretty upscale, service is very attentive, but not excessive in my opinion. The food is a complete miss for the price, though. Compared to other Brazilian Steakhouses I&#39;ve been to, the price here is higher, the selection at the salad buffet is smaller, the beef quality seemed poorer and some cuts too heavily salted, but the pork and chicken options seemed of similar quality. The absolute deal breaker that ruined the whole meal for me was the lamb, though. The lamb was the absolute oiliest, gamiest tasting lamb I have ever had at any restaurant.

Not sure if it&#39;s because the restaurant is new and it might improve over time, but I will probably opt for other Brazilian Steakhouses when the urge arises."

No thanks...). However, there was a decent selection with salads, smoked salmon, cheeses and meats, mushrooms, potato and chicken salads, rice and beans, bread, and soup. The squash soup was delicious. They also put mashed potatoes, rolls, bananas and polenta on the table and brought more whenever we finished one. It was brought up that we were celebrating a birthday and they brought out an enormous (complimentary!) slice of key lime pie that we all shared. Our waiter and the other waiters walking around were very attentive, constantly refilling our glasses and bringing us new plates and whatever we needed.

The place was half empty, yet we were led to a table in a crowded corner (this is troublesome because meat servers walk around frequently to carve meat at the table, and they don&#39;t even have enough space between tables to walk around).

The dining experience was decent. The food taste good. Market Place (salad bar) had a variety of salads, salami, cheese, soup, etc. Meat selection was limited for dinner (picanha, ribeye, sausage, rib, parmesan covered pork, a couple types of lamb, fillet mignon). 

Service lacked order. My server came to take drink order while another was putting down water glasses for everyone. We never got the lemon we requested because everything was rushed at the beginning. The server never came by again. However, the meat servers were pleasant. 

Overall, I was not wowed by the experience. I would recommend people to sign up for fogo&#39;s email subscription to get $15 off."

We&#39;ve been to Chama Gaucha  a few times and we couldn&#39;t help but compare it side by side. I reviewed by category, so read what is most important to you.

Service: Our reservation was for 7:30, we got in at 7...on a Saturday night. Odd, I would have expected to wait and for it to be crowded. But cool, we&#39;re in. We had three different people approach and ask us if someone was waiting on our table. Do they not have dedicated sections? Anyway. It took the meat cutting guys a long time to reach our table, which was in the middle of the room, right by the salad bar. For some reason, they would skip our table a lot. We had to flag down our waiter and two other cut guys to get the filet man to see us. One finally came around with a tiny pathetic piece meant for one person that was already cold. All we wanted was a fresh, normal cut of filet. It took us an hour to get that piece of filet. Incredible. There were times we were offered &#34;rare&#34; cuts only because they ran out of medium rare. They would then act offended if we didn&#39;t accept their leftover raw piece...it was so bizarre and seemed very disorganized. 

Chama is on top of things when it comes to the meat and service. There&#39;s never a time where I felt neglected. They will even come up and ask if you are looking for anything specific regularly. We&#39;ve been there on normal nights and New Years (which was crazy packed) and everything ran smoothly, to the point that managers were bussing tables to help out if needed. They are also using those crumb scraper thing to constantly clean your table and pull out chairs for the ladies. It&#39;s top notch. Fogo: 0 Chama: 1

Food / Quality / Portions: While not horrible, they were VERY inconsistent. Some cuts of meat we got were extremely fatty and some were very over-seasoned and salty, and portion sizes were all over the place. With the same meat and the same guy cutting it, I (115lbs, 5&#39;3) somehow would manage to get HUGE slices while my boyfriend (6&#39;0, 225 lbs bodybuilder) would get slivers. We would have to trade portion sizes because of how much of a difference it was. Also, some of their skewers would just have rare meat on them so it was either take it rare or too bad, you&#39;re shit out of luck and have to wait 10 minutes for someone else to come along. Some servers would walk around with one tiny piece of meat left on their skewer (meant for one person) and try to offer it to a full table. 1) What if the whole table wants a cut? 2) You&#39;ve been walking around for 10 minutes with that piece...it&#39;s now cold. Salad bar was okay, sides were meh. Mashed potatoes were overly garlicky, and the bread was a bit too dry.

Chama Gaucha always has a full stock of meat on the skewers, consistent in cuts, and have it cooked to your liking. I like mine medium rare. There is never a point where I&#39;ve had to accept anything else. Plus, their bread is way better. Fogo: 0 Chama: 2

Cleanliness: While the restaurant was generally clean, the salad bar was a bit of a mess. A lot of food spillage on the edges and mostly empty containers. One staff member was helping an older (but not elder) lady grab stuff around the salad bar. The older lady took the fruit tong and used it for every salad bar item around the table and the staff member did nothing about it but follow and watch her. I wanted fruit..so I asked that staff lady for a new tong. She hands me the dirty utensil from the pickled veggies and tells me to use that. Thanks, I really wanted pickled heart of palm/ pickled artichoke on my pineapple. I can see this type of activity happening at a Golden Corral or Old Country Buffet or something...but not here. That was unacceptable. 

I can say Chama&#39;s salad bar is in order and people aren&#39;t cross-using utensils and things have been restocked consistently. Fogo: 0 Chama: 3 

Bacon: Okay, they have this peppered maple bacon next to the salad bar that is AMAZING. Seriously. I should have just indulged on that the entire time. Maybe my experience would have been better, but then I&#39;d probably have to leave on a stretcher. Chama has no bacon :[ Fogo: 1 Chama: 3

Chama wins on all accounts, minus the bacon. Sadly, as much as I loved the bacon, it&#39;s not enough to bring me back here.

*Bonus* Atmosphere: Fogo is bright and modern, while Chama has a more dark and classy feel to it. Maybe the classiness of Chama is why their service is so much better?"

Our reservation was at 6:30 on Father&#39;s Day. We got there at 6:30.  But needed to wait for another 20 minutes before we&#39;re seated.  Maybe because it&#39;s Father&#39;s Day and it&#39;s a relatively small restaurant but a 20-minute wait even with a reservation is still long I think. 

Service is very good.  Servers are attentive.  But sometimes it takes a long time for a meat guy to come over.  It was only 7:40pm and I waited a good 10 minutes on one occasion.  The server saw I was waiting and she asked me if there&#39;s a specific kind of meat I was looking for.  Kudos. 

The salad bar is ok. Everything is fresh and well stocked.  However the soup was not hot enough for my taste.  Cocktails are quite pricey.  

I must say i was very disappointed when it comes to their meat.  They&#39;re just not tasty.  Some of them has no taste at all.  I always wanted my beef medium rare but most of the time, it&#39;s too done. I just could never get the correct temperature even the meat guy came back for a second time.  While the beef are too done, one of my pork sausage was undercooked.  Too inconsistent. 

I&#39;m sorry but I&#39;ll still go to Chama Gaucha for Brazilian steak.  Service for both restaurants are excellent but Chama has much better food IMO."

I&#39;ve seen a couple of complaints in reviews, but please ignore them. Honestly - look at how many fabulous and detailed reviews there are. To top it off, this location just opened a few months ago. For them to have received such praise while they&#39;re still &#34;working out the kinks&#34; speaks volumes for the quality of the staff and for the Manager. I can&#39;t say enough good things. Just looking around and observing the way the entire staff worked seamlessly as a team speaks volumes to the gem they have in their leader, who you can tell genuinely cares about her customers and her workers. Everyone exudes a sense of pride in their work and a high regard for their clientele. It is obvious they love what they do, and you should, too."

We made them for 8:30 Friday night and we didn&#39;t get seated until 9:30. We saw other walkins that came at the same time as us and they got seated first so it&#39;s really just first come first served.  I think in this case they should just stipulate &#39;no reservations&#39; so people&#39;s expectations are set.  Once we got seated it was freezing in the dining room...all 3 of us were cold.  The meats didn&#39;t seem the same variety as the one in downtown.  My daughter was half price but didn&#39;t really like the salad bar as much as I had hoped.  With the hour long wait on a reservation it just made for a &#39;not ideal&#39; experience.  Although I&#39;m still giving 3 stars because it is a nice restaurant and I did like the meats that came to the table although I do think they have more servers downtown so the different meats comes faster.  The manager did try to appease us once we got our seats and giving coupons for hopefully a better experience next time.  So it started off bad but ended up ok.

If I am going to pay what I consider to be a lot for a meal I want the 5 star treatment and the food had better match up as well. This was my first time coming to the Naperville location. I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect since the location is a lot smaller than downtown. To my surprise it far exceeded my expectations. 

Service: Since it is not as busy as the downtown location the workers were able to really give each guest more specialized treatment and attention. If it had not been for the wonderful staff I know I wouldn&#39;t have enjoyed my dinning experience as much as I did. Our waiter Adam K. was so gracious and patient with all of the questions we had. He was witty and funny. Having myself and my dinning companion laughing and wanting to even invite him to sit with us. Every time I looked up from my plate Mr. Adam was scanning the room to see that all of the guests had everything they needed. Even anticipating what we could possibly want before we knew we even wanted it. He was an absolutely perfect waiter. Although Adam was the rockstar here there were a few other note worthy employees. Ms. Lola was sweet and attentive. Mr. Carlos(meat server) was always aiming to please us with the perfect cut of meat to out liking. Going out of his way to give us perfection every time.  

Food: If you are wondering if the meats are up to par they definitely are. 98% of the time the meat was literally sizzling coming off of the skewer. Although the salad bar is smaller than the downtown location I didn&#39;t feel as though I was missing anything. All of the major players were there. 

Drinks: We ordered a couple of mojitos which were absolutely divine which again I can blame our now good friend Adam for. We also tried the pineapple infused rum in shot form. I didn&#39;t even feel that there was any alcohol in at all. But watch out those guys can creep up on you.  

All in all go check out the new Naperville Fogo you will not be disappointed."

The food is what you would expect. The thing is...The only way I can justify spending an egregious amount of money on one meal is if the service is stellar, which it usually is at these Brazilian restaurants, so you feel like you get what you pay for. Unfortunately, this location did not impress. I found the staff to be cold and disinterested in providing the customer service that you would expect. I may have let it slide, and maybe given one more star in this review, if it wasn&#39;t for the fact that, on top of being ignored for fresh plates for 15 minutes, we were offered sparkling water before ordering and then charged $6.50 for each bottle. Watch out for this - They served us 3 bottles and we didn&#39;t even finish the 3rd - That means we spent almost $20 on water without even asking for it! That is too much to charge your customers who are already laying down $70 for a few pieces of meat and a salad bar. I was outraged when we got the bill. We won&#39;t return.

Also- just found out this morning- the less-than-enthused hostess didn&#39;t check in our open table reservation so I got tagged as a no show. I have a difficult last name and she obviously didn&#39;t want to take the time to deal with it."

I love meat - all kinds of meat! What better place could one imagine than a Brazilian Steakhouse with endless choices of meaty goodness. We have been to Chama Gaucha in Downers Grove and loved it. Now that we have a Fogo de Chao here in Naperville we were excited to try it for a special Valentine&#39;s Day dinner. 

Ambiance is nice - a bit too bright for my taste but good looking. We were seated for our reservation time immediately and the server was good and attentive.  The Market Table with all the salads, cheeses etc was well stocked with a great variety. The meat unfortunately was a complete letdown. They sure had a good variety and the meat just keep coming. But none of it had flavor! We even had to ask for steak sauce!!! That is almost a sin...but was necessary to have any taste. So sad! 

Sorry Fogo de Chao - the Naperville location was a disappointment. We will definitely take the slightly longer trip to Chama Gaucha anytime! Not even a close comparison.  Anyone wanting to try Fogo de Chao in Naperville - save yourself the disappointment..."

The temperature.  Then...the waitress never explained the options for just ordering the salad bar in the case of a vegetarian.  Good thing I knew. Then we went to the salad bar which pales in comparison to its competition. Most of the items needed marinating or dressing.....seasoning....something. 
Then it look a very long time to get meat. We had to ask several times. By the time we got the cuts we really wanted we had already seen all the others several times and were full.
I was hoping for a better experience. There were also a ton of kids there.  At $50.00 a person I didnt expect that. I doubt I&#39;ll be back.  Disappointing."

She did not appear to be pleased with her job and her attitude is rubbing off on my excitement for dinner tonight. A bit of a rocky start for my first visit here to say the least... 2 stars for you. Maybe even 1. 


Yelp is not allowing me to leave an update review. Hm.

We dined on a Monday night, so the main dining room was about 30% occupied. The dining staff works as a big team, so you will be taken (great) care of by 2 or more waiters that serve your beverages and unlimited sides (like mashed potatoes and caramelized bananas). If you ever want more, just ask your waiter. I had the Superfruit Lemonade, that was delicious! They do offer tap water or sparkling water like Pellegrino for a charge. It was our first time at a Fogo, so the waiter explained to us that everybody works as a team and the rules are simple, if you flip your table card to green, the meat will come running! Full? Just flip it back to red.

We were off to explore the market table/salad bar. INCREDIBLE! Salmon, asparagus, veggies, soup, and more. The bacon is a MUST-TRY, it was sweet and spicy, we couldn&#39;t get enough.

We tried every cut of meat, most of which I don&#39;t remember actually because we wanted to try a little bit of everything so we didn&#39;t turn anything down when they offered. Sometimes it was hard to understand what they said they are offering. I was left with a mouth watering impression after trying the bacon wrapped filet mignon, cooked medium. It was tender and juicy so I was really excited to try the filet mignon on its own. We had to ask for it a couple times, and when we finally got it; I can&#39;t say that it was worth the wait. I imagined it would melt in my mouth like most other filet mignon cuts I&#39;ve had. I was not blown away, unfortunately. We just asked for more bacon wrapped filet mignon because that serving seemed to be a lot more tender and pleasing. All in all, the meat wasn&#39;t anything to die for, honestly. We&#39;ve had better. 5 star service. 3.5-4 star meat.

And as other people had mentioned, at the end of our dinner, we were brought surprise creme brûlée for our anniversary. Except that the plate was decorated with &#34;happy birthday&#34;. A for effort, but overall the experience was missing something. And the host was in fact a teenager that did not smile once. We would come back if there was a promotion. Can&#39;t say that $49.95 per person is worth the experience. Updated my review from 2 stars to 4."

The space is really nice and modern and very clean.  Everyone from the Host to the servers and bartenders, were all excellent and very friendly.  They start you off with these little rolls that are like nothing I&#39;ve had before, they are light and flaky like a croissant, but with a little cheese in them.  You can then hit the &#34;salad&#34; bar, that is filled with all sorts of interesting selections, not just salads.  Then it&#39;s on to the main course... bring on the meat! The gauchos come around constantly with a variety of different meats, lamb, chicken and pork and you just start eating and eating.  The food is so good you don&#39;t want to stop, but eventually you have to wave the white flag.  Nothing I tried was bad, it was all delicious.

The wine manger was very nice but I was surprised my guest knew me about there wines than they did! The servers were awesome and my tip showed it! the side are very small from what I am have had at the Rosemont Steakhouse. Seemed the staff was learning certain things! We ordered 2 cappuccino&#39;s and they bought out 3 we tried to return the one and they said it was comp! They put it on the check! I did not fight it because we were getting frustrated with the minor mistakes. My fault!

I am not giving a full 5 stars because the meat they served wasn&#39;t as juicy as I expected it to be. The food was cooked properly and tasted great but not to the level what I was expecting. I have been to a restaurant in Canada called Copacabana and it has the same concept of servers bringing meat to your table but at Copacabana there is a much greater variety of meat and it is much more tender and juicer. Even the salad bar was ok and did not have much of a variety. Sadly I have another restaurant to compare this to but if I came here before going to Copacabana then I probably would have said this is spectacular! 
Lamb chops are one of my favorites but not here- had an abnormal aftertaste. 
Their cocktails are very nice and strong! I&#39;m glad I got one of those. 
If they can put more variety then I would definitely give them 5 stars."

I remember going to the Chicago location and the ambiance and food were much better.  My wife and I felt like the meat was not as flavorful as before. We had a manager come to the table and ask us what we thought. She could tell that we were not too impressed. I politely told her the downtown location seemed better. She informed me that they are able to use charcoal for the meats in Chicago but only gas here. Once she said that it made sense because I knew something was off. 

Service was great, almost too great because there was a person at your table every couple minutes. 

When you really sit back and think about it these restaurants are nothing more than upscale buffets where they bring the meat to your table. You can get a much better meal for two for the $150 you will spend here."

Price is high but worthy: environment is nice, kitchen is clean, service and food is high quality.
You can eat all what you want, so come here hungry: you can serve from the the salad bar, where is a plenty of options, try feijoada or wait for the different steaks that the waiters will bring to your table. My favorite one: Picanha.
Also they will bring complementary appetizer: Brazilian cheese bread (Pao de Queijo), plantain, smash potatoes: all delicious!!!
The typical and for me the best dessert to accompany your great meal is: Papaya cream
If you are in the area and want to try Brazilian cuisine, fine and fancy restaurant, and ready to eat plenty of food: this is the place!

The employees were on top of things and well trained. One thing I dislike about this style is there is no pace to the meal. You are either full on or off. A few times we couldn&#39;t get the cut or temperature we wanted. Meat didn&#39;t have the good flavor or texture I&#39;ve had at other places.

The front desk staff was very pleasant and showed us to our table within minutes.  The restaurant was already hopping at noon on a Sunday.  We were immediately greeted by Melissa, who obviously had a great knowledge of the menu and the unique offerings Fogo has available.  The Market table was full of delicious salads, fresh fruit, amazing vegetables and fabulous meats and cheeses..  The brown sugar and red peppered bacon was one of our favorites.  We also loved the black beans and rice.  Everything was so fresh, flavorful and unique.  
And then came the meats!  We tried almost everything that came by.  The gauchos were very helpful in describing the meats and how they were prepared.  They would slice up a piece that was served at just the right temperature.  Make sure to try the homemade steak sauce and horseradish sauce.  So good!
The restaurant is light, beautiful and bustling.  It really was more than just a meal, but an experience.  The managers were observed jumping in wherever needed, engaging with the guests, picking up plates, straightening the market table and keeping the obviously well-oiled machine running smoothly.

This comment IS NOT about the hic-cup which I thoroughly understand as it was just the luck of timing when we attended BUT what was done about it when addressed. 

Let me tell you that not only was it listened to and addressed promptly by our server but the restaurant manager Elvira Hyska made it her mission to not only to fix it but more than make up for what was merely a small disappointment overall. My wife turned from being a little disappointed to proclaiming it the best service she had ever received. I had to agree.

I rarely get to spend lunch with my wife and Elvira and the rest of the staff made the entire experience wonderful from that point on. 

The lamb is to die for (don&#39;t miss the mint jelly), I&#39;ve never had a bad piece of meat here. Ever. 

Sure. You could say that its more expensive than some places you may dine BUT I challenge you to go to the supermarket and order the same cuts of meat and eat the same amount you do here and not realize that this is an incredible experience for a wonderful price. 

Customer for life. Nuff said."

The Market Bar had great items as well-salmon, gourmet cheeses and deli meats, green beans with carrots (the carrots are delish), awesome fresh fruits, soups, candied and peppered bacon (a little spicy but tasty), chicken salad, apple salad, the list goes on and on. Everything was amazing, from the food to the service. Tony, the manager made us feel like family. Service was wonderfully attentive. Food was delish. This isn&#39;t a place you can visit often because normal people just can&#39;t eat pounds and pounds of food at one setting, but it&#39;s a great special occasion option.

I&#39;ll start with the positives.  The salad bar was well-stocked and everything there seemed fresh.  I think the interior of the restaurant is really nice with really high ceilings and cool artwork.  There is also plenty of parking that is actually free (which is one positive aspect that sets it apart from the other 2 fogos in Chicago).  The quality of most of the meats was rather good.  

I think the biggest problem encountered was with the service.  It seemed quite under-staffed with some waiters/managers acting as gauchos.  What I like about going to fogo is that you can have a quality meal in a short amount of time.  In and out in about 45 minutes can be a good thing.  My past experiences at fogo have been you turn your card to green and immediately you are bombarded with meat, you get 3-4 meats, then turn to red and eat the meats w/ your sides.  The experience at this particular fogo during lunch hour took almost 2 hours and we literally had our cards turned to green the entire time.  There seemed to be a good 10 minute gap between meat offerings.  In isolation this isn&#39;t such a bad thing if your one to take your time while dining, but when you already have your sides out they inevitably get cold during this waiting period resulting in a worse overall dining experience.  There also were a few meat selections that were subpar (a new pork chop that was really overseasoned and a top sirloin that was very tough).  I also did get dessert, the papaya cream, which is always good.  However, after the dessert was ordered there was a 15 minute wait at which time the check was brought out.  I told the waiter about the dessert order that hadn&#39;t been brought out.  He did apologize and then it was brought out a little later.  I&#39;ll also comment that the bathroom floor was sticky and 1/2 soap dispensers was empty.

Bottom line, I would go to the fogo downtown or in Rosemont if you have a choice.  It looks like this one still has quite a few kinks to work out."

Don&#39;t get me wrong, an attentive staff and one working as a team to service all tables is a great thing but when over a dozen different people are circling your table and asking if things are okay and if they can get you anything it gets exhausting. I did not enjoy my meal. In order to answer and be polite I felt like I could barely eat. One bite of food and someone new wants to check on us. A sip of water and the next one asks again. It was overwhelming and frustrating to say the least!! Cool it everyone. At one point my husband said he was tempted to write a note to set on the table that said, &#34;we are good, everything&#39;s tasting fine and yes we&#39;ve been to a Fogo before.&#34; It was relentless!

If you sit outside, be prepared for noise! It&#39;s right across the street from the train station."

we have been having bad experiences. Their food is decent but the service is lacking. We arrived at  5:40 and waited at least 5 minutes before someone brought us menus and another 5 before our server put water on our table and walked away to go run pizza. I have been in the industry a while and completely understand when food is up it needs to go. But it should not have taken 10 minutes for our server to get to us, there were 6 other tables seated. We ordered our drinks, which did come promptly, thank god. We ordered a pizza and told the sever we still needed a moment to order the next pizza. Our server didn&#39;t not come back for at least 20 minutes. We ordered another pizza and another round. 15minutes later, a total of 35 minutes our first pizza arrived. After about 10 minutes our server checked in again. At this point we were just annoyed because we had the food took so long and the service was slow. We asked if our pizza was almost done and he said said soon, 2 minutes. I thought that would be a good time to mention how slow the service was and that we were unhappy. He asked if we wanted a box....yes I want a box for my $17 pizza so I can&#39;t eat it at home. Then he said I&#39;ll take care of it. Well I interpreted that as the pizza is on us and we will box it. Then the checked showed up and no pizza. I was done with this place and just left. 

Long story short, if you want a quick pizza go across the street to Doughocracy and if you want Cotto Legna  but WAY better go to Gia Mia behind the Starbucks on the other side of 38."

Located in downtown Geneva, nestled amongst local shops and restaurants, this place is a gem! I was able to make my reservation through Yelp --bonus!!!  Although they were busy, we were seated right away by a humble host.  The appetizer menu had a vast array of bruschetta ranging from traditional to ceviche. They also had traditional and seafood pastas, blah blah blah. 

Cotto a Legna bruschetta $10: MUST HAVE! The bread was soft and perfectly chewy topped with bacon, sliced fresh pear, blue cheese, and raspberry marmalade--- DIVINE 

Eggplant parmigiana $12 with angel hair pasta $9 on the side. A bit salty but quite tasty. The eggplant was hearty and the angel hair pasta was a perfect compliment to this appetizer dish. 

Chocolate soufflé $8: nothing special here. I would try their lava cake instead. 

Red moscato (Italy) $9: sweet, fresh, and light. Great dessert wine. 

Service: it could be better. We weren&#39;t needy but I was parched after a long day of work. A water refill would have been nice. 

I will definitely return to try all their 10 different variety of bruschetta 

Prego!"

A great addition to downtown Geneva and in a great location near the train station and a bunch of new restaurants/shops as well! Their pizza is really, really good and they offer a decent variety of flavors so even the pickiest of eaters in your party will find something they like. 

I&#39;ve also tried the pasta there, and it is really good as well. My favorite is the pizza with eggplant on it. The pizzas there are a decent size, and split well between two people or if you are a very hungry person you could finish one off by yourself too. Definitely check it out."

We only ordered appetizers, and we were disappointed in them. The pizza was pretty good; the fried calamari was a disappointment; not crispy and you usually can&#39;t go wrong with that. We also ordered Zuppa di Mare. When it was delivered I smelled the mussels from across the table ( so strong I&#39;m surprised the chef didn&#39;t notice) and on trying, it did not taste good. When I told the waiter, he checked with the kitchen. Their first response was to tell us the seafood  had just been delivered that day. I explained again that they were not right.

They have a unique and my most favorite  house salad with a welcome array of vegetables that breaks the crowd-pleasing monotony of Caesar and mixed field greens. 

The pizza is fantastic. The crust is thin and simultaneously crisp and chewy, with an excellent stretch to the dough and slightly smoky. Sometimes the pizza can be a little dark but the charcoal adds, especially with the red sauce based pizzas.  And the pizzas are not overly cheesy or sauced.

I think that they put crack in their fried eggplant pizza, so be careful. Subsequent cravings are powerful and intense and I suspect something equally addicting has been added to the arugula and Parmesan one, as well. For the meat-lovers the sausage is flavorful with the right amount of heat, although I would steer away from adding  the wurst, just a bit weird and has the taste and texture of hot dogs. 

My daughter is addicted to the salmon farfalle, and although, as for myself, I am not a fan of the cream sauce, this version is light and doesn&#39;t overwhelm the salmon and I like the spinach (as does my daughter who normally hates spinach) and subtle lemon pepper in the cream sauce.  Really good.
Props to them for always making me linguine with clams, when the offer only
A Frutte del Mar; you are awesome, I am a pain but I appreciate it.

The only negative is that it can get really loud, I think it is an acoustics issue. The affability and accommodating staff can take their time, but they make up for it

Came here last night because I love their margarita pizza- but they only had 2 servers on and that just isn&#39;t enough. Idk if someone called in or what. We ordered the calamari last night as well and it was cold when it hit the table so it had a gummy texture when we ate it which was a huge bummer. But our server never came to check on us so we had no one to tell about it. I know u guys usually have great calamari when it&#39;s hot and fresh because I&#39;ve had it before. But we had to ask 3-4 times for certain things and it took 30 minutes to get certain things we asked for... Just not acceptable. The girls had no tables inside. Just a full patio. And most of the tables had already been served &amp; closed out so they were just sitting there relaxing- so we were somewhat confused as to what was going on.

The hosts of our party ordered all of the food so didn&#39;t even really look at the menu, but this is my take on what we had.

First we got 2 bottles of wine. I know nothing about wine but it tasted fine. Then the apps came. The calamari was pretty delicious. It also came in a pretty hefty size which is more than I can say for some other places. I also had the caprese and I&#39;m not a tomato fan but this was pretty delicious. The tomato and cheese were on point.

We had a bunch of different pastas but the only one I tried was the boscaiola pasta which was pretty bomb. I didn&#39;t get any of the sausage in my scoop but the sauce in t his one was crazy good.

We also got a lot of different pizzas but I only remember eating two of them. The margherita was pretty good, good flavor. The fina was all right, just a pain to eat. Like are you suppose to try and cut the arugula or scoop it off first, who knows. I was so lost.

I was here last night and had good food and decent wine. The three of us ordered and shared Bruschetta with artichoke (highly recommended), a gnocchi special with mushrooms (really good, but not gnocchi, more like ravioli), and a 12&#34; pesto pizza. Washing it all down was a glass of the Estancia Cab.

The food really is good. The service is decent, the menu offers new specials pretty often and I definitely recommend it."

The food comes nowhere near the prices they are asking. Ex. on the specials menu, like 3 or 4 raviolis, like $24, $24 for ravioli??

Its just not there for me, I don&#39;t see it. Pizzas are stil just ok, nothing here lives up to its potential.

It could just be a reasonably priced place with good simple food and nice pizzas in the hands of somebody that knows what to do."

The menu was convoluted, and the lack of focus shows in the food.  I ordered the sausage bruschetta from the specials menu. The sausage was tasty, and the bread was good.  That having been said, it was served swimming in a pool of oil. Add that to the fattiness of the sausage and the brie cheese, and the $12 I paid for it was insulting.  This price was not posted, so caveat emptor, I suppose.

The signage indicates that this is an upscale pizza place.  The pizza was only a very small portion of the menu, and there was not an option for a simple pepperoni pizza.  They did make my husband his desired pepperoni pizza, but it was not worth a return visit.  I liked my pesto pizza, which would have been better if they had not been so stingy with the sundried tomatoes.

Our service was timely and attentive, without being too much so.

This place has great potential.  If they would handle the noise issue, simplify the menu, focus on good pizza, and quit relying on pretentious sounding ingredients, they could have my continued business."

I head here every couple of weeks to get my fix.  Still have not found another place in the suburbs that matches the quality of authentic Italian cuisine as Cotto A Legna does.  Continues to be my go-to spot for Italian.
cotto-a-legna-geneva,Leslie S.,rbQp0U49dlq-IcC9d3uBdw,"Geneva, IL",1,1,1,13,3,WZeSr5srVTyH40pIA8oyEg,4.0,2012-12-15,"I wanted to update my review for Cotto a Legna, as it&#39;s now been a year since I first started coming this restaurant. I can now say, with certainty, that this is my favorite pizza restaurant in the States. Yes, I am serious. I love Cotto. I love the food, I love the staff, and I love the outdoor patio. I love that they bring my dog cups of water. And they let my fiance&#39;s daughter watch the pizza dough being rolled and put in the oven while keeping her drink filled and telling her how adorable she is.

The mussels as an appetizer are my go-to, but I love the Caprese salad as well (both are huge though, so you might want to consider sharing). The mussels are all properly cooked and the sauce is delicious. They&#39;re happy to bring extra bread and spoons to help you mop up the extra sauce if need be. It&#39;s a great dish.

Initially, I was so happy to find a properly cooked margherita pizza that I didn&#39;t want to order anything else. Do you know just how rare it is to find a true margherita pizza? One that is not actually covered in cheese, but has just a few dollops of it, along with lots of olive oil, fresh herbs and tomatoes? I can assure you it is indeed a rarity. But Cotto does it and does it well. For that alone, I am grateful.

But eventually, I did branch out and try some of the other pizzas, and they too have all been splendid. I cannot rave enough about the funghi pizza, but mushrooms are in fact one of my favorite foods, so I should throw out that caveat. It&#39;s a beautiful pizza, covered in mushrooms (that are actually pre-cooked, not just thrown onto the pizza raw, which is a personal pet peeve) and herbs. I honestly eat an entire funghi pizza by myself - that is how much I love it.

Everyone has a different preference when it comes to pizza, so let me take just a moment to explain what you&#39;ll find at Cotto - these are thin crust, wood-fired pizzas. They should be crisp, possibly a bit charred on the edges. If you&#39;re interested in deep dish, try Lou Malnati&#39;s instead.

It seems like most reviewers complaints are directed at service. We have had great service at Cotto - I cannot recommend James or Stacy enough, as both are very attentive, friendly and helpful. Loryn is another terrific waitress if you&#39;re seated in the bar area. And get to know Igor and Nick, the co-owners, if you have an opportunity. They can share with you what they&#39;re trying to do at Cotto, and can probably find the perfect dish for you."

Server was good and the pasta was yummy.  This time was a nightmare.  Party of six which include three kids and our meal took 50 mins.  when  the meal came, she delivered two pizzas and when to serve other tables. Almost 10 mins later two more meals delivered but still two short.   The last two out, plain pasta with butter.  I had actually left the table twice to find our server during this time.  I could go on about the poor service but I&#39;m sure you get the point. 

I would also tell you about my chat with the manager, but the manager didn&#39;t bother to stop by. Instead the check came with nothing removed and 18% tip already on the bill.  That was the last straw.  

Geneva is full of great place to eat and this simply isn&#39;t one of them."

This place is right near the train station, so it was very convenient for us. After stopping in, we were told a wait time of about 30 minutes. It wasn&#39;t a problem for us, so we headed across the street to the Caboose to have a drink.

Fastforward to when we come back on time. We still stood in the entryway for a solid 10 minutes before we were even acknowledged. We were shown to a small table, without a word being said to us. A bus boy gave us plates and utensils, but it was another 15 minutes of waiting before someone even came over to introduce themselves or pour water. It wasn&#39;t until we were about to leave that a woman came over and poured water.

The waitress didn&#39;t introduce herself, or apologize for the wait or lack of service. After receiving menus, she didn&#39;t even give us time to look at the menu before asking what we would like. She didn&#39;t seem very patient while we asked questions about the entrees either. Once we placed our orders (2 pasta dishes and a salad.) We waited. And we waited. And we waited some more.

It took about 60 minutes for our meals to come out. While we were waiting, we were not greeted by anyone, offered any drinks, bread or receive an apology about the wait. We saw people who had arrived after us receive hot appetizers before we even got our food. A simple &#34;I&#39;m sorry the kitchen is really backed up right now. Can I get you something while you wait?&#34; would have been better than the service we received. 

Once the food did arrive, it didn&#39;t even come out at once. The two pasta dishes arrived 10 minutes before the salad. We thought that was a little odd. We ate our dishes and enjoyed them. The food is pretty tasty, rich and filling. When we were finished, we still had half our plates in front of us. The waitress didn&#39;t immediatley offer us boxes, just placed the check on the table and walked away. We later asked for the boxes to go.

We left feeling disgruntled and put off. The atmosphere is also pretty loud, so you may have to shout to your dining companion to be heard. Although the food was good, the atmosphere and service is off. I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be coming back here again."

She asked how I had made my reservation and when I said through Yelp she said &#34;Oh that doesn&#39;t work yet&#34; even though I even received a conformation e-mail from Yelp. Pizza was average at best. I ordered Margherita with added Italian Sausage, spouse ordered Salmone. Margherita had ample ingredients but lacked flavor. I would call it bland even. Could not tell that it was wood fired cooked. Salmone was more flavorful but again could not tell it was cooked in wood fired oven. Prices were very reasonable.

The pizza is the closest I&#39;ve seen to authentic southern Italian pizza.  A little blackened crust on the outside and a little soggy in the middle is how they do it.

Anyway, if you are a couple, go here and split the eggplant parmigiano and a margarita pizza.  Enjoy, then look at the bill and realize that you can&#39;t find a better quality meal for less money."

My date and I couldn&#39;t decide what we wanted, so we figured we&#39;d try the mussel appetizer.  You usually can&#39;t go wrong with P.E.I. mussels.  Lo and behold, the the mussels in this dish were simply f***ing amazing, no other way to describe them.  These divine shellfish were the largest mussels I have ever seen in my life.  Epic.  Huge.  They came swimming in a tomato sauce with some grilled bread.  I&#39;m still trying to think of a superlative to describe how much I loved this dish.  I took a picture of it (see for yourself) and was scolded by my date for being an Instragram hipster LOL~ the lengths I go to in order to make my reviews worthwhile ;)

We also ended up getting a couple of caprese sandwiches (ordered before the mussels came out) for the main dish.  Had we known how enormous the mussels were we could have easily split the sandwich.  The tomatoes on the caprese were surprisingly flavorful for December, I&#39;d love to know where they source their produce from.  Overall the sandwich was decent- nothing that was outstanding, but still a solid dish.  The sides of fries here are also delish.  

They have a nice wine list, we ended up relying on our server to help us navigate.  She was really cool, totally laid back, and made the trip even more fun.  I&#39;d definitely come back here again.  I&#39;d love to try the pizza and some of the daily specials.  Overall a big 2 thumbs up, 4 stars!"

Many of those complaints are echoed in the reviews of my fellow Yelpers -- like the burnt pizza (I think it&#39;s more like burnt bits of flour stuck to the crust of the pizza - I&#39;&#39;m guessing they just haven&#39;t figured out their oven yet), no iced tea the night we were there (it wasn&#39;t even 7pm on a Friday night), a server that didn&#39;t know what manchego cheese was - and couldn&#39;t help us decipher the cheese choices we had on the meat and cheese &#34;piatta&#34; menu (and not a word of explanation on the menu either), and a front door with a broken closer that left the door open and the cold air streaming in, and a noise level that precludes any comfortable conversation.

Competition is fierce for restaurant business in the Fox Valley area - especially on 3rd Street in Geneva, and you have to be on your game to survive here. The pieces are all here -- i just hope they can figure out how to put them all together."

Ai Funghi - The brick oven pizza topped with tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella and mushrooms was tasty. It was a little saucer than I prefer but the sauce flavor wasn&#39;t overwhelming so it was enjoyable. 

Insalata Cotto A Legna - The salad was very fresh and I absolutely loved it. Arugula topped with thinly sliced green apples, a little blue cheese, bits of bacon (not too much) and toasted hazelnuts. Topped with a light vinaigrette. YUM! I think I enjoyed it more than the pizza!

Atmosphere - Modern but still warm. It isn&#39;t too large of a restaurant so a reservation might be a good idea on a Friday or Saturday (if they take them). My only complaint was the music was cheesy - sounded like a department store or something...but at least it was low and probably easy to ignore when the restaurant is busy.

Service - We had a lovely server who was very nice and attentive. Our food was quick but we went on a saturday afternoon - not sure about the evening shift."

The overly Italian titled name and menu items are obvious, but the restaurant is anything but authentically Italian. While entering the restaurant, I was greeted with neither an Italian eatery, nor a chic brick oven concept. Instead, I entered a noisy decorless dry wall box with a pizza oven in the back corner. There was no music playing throughout my entire dinner, so all I could hear was clanking glasses and the occasional crash of shattering pizza plates (the servers dropped 2 full pizzas on the ground while I was there). My table was awkwardly in the middle of the room right in front of the entrance door, but as I looked around the room to ask the  server if I could switch tables, I realized that all of the tables were places equally nonsensically.  

The menu tried desperately to appear authentically italian, but the American crowd pleasers like clam chowder nixed that idea. I was served a terrible cocktail, so asked the waitress for a beer suggestion, but she didn&#39;t know the difference between a lager, wheat beer, or ale. I finally was served my pizza, and left with a stomach ache. The pizzas had no focus or balance--the chef just decided to pile as many powerful &#34;Italian&#34; ingredients on top as possible. 

My experience ended with a tall female server scolding me because she, &#34;almost tripped on my purse.&#34; Considering there were no purse hooks, I don&#39;t really see how that is my problem.

I only came to this restaurant because it was convenient after a long commute to chicago. Next time, I&#39;ll take the 10 minute drive across the river to Pizzeria Neo instead of settling for a cheap immitation."

My husband and I have been here twice.  They have a great selection of bruschetta made with fresh ingredients which are delicious.  As for entres, both times we dined here my food was good but my husband&#39;s was not at all what was described on the menu.  This evening he found this fact very frustrating.  He not only hates carmelized onions but they make him sick and they were everywhere in the dish he ordered.  When he explained this to a bus girl (our server disappeared) she just said &#34;sorry&#34; but did nothing about it.   It would have been nice to have been offered something else since he couldn&#39;t eat any of the meal.  What made matters worse is that he asked for another drink twice and never received it.

She was attentive and when there was a mistake on the bill she fixed it.  Now for the negatives.  The pizza was not good.  Our pizzas were very soggy and it was nearly impossible to pick a piece up and not have the toppings fall off.  Our server took one of the pies back to the oven to see if it could crisp the crust, but it didn&#39;t really make a difference-still soggy.  Another negative is that this joint can be very, very loud making it difficult to hear others at your table.

Bottom line: When you go out for a dinner of four, spend $160 on a meal, and end up with soggy pizza and difficult conversations, I think you get 2 stars for that night."

We had the mussels marinera, Margherita pizza &amp; the salad w/salmon.All fine, except that we waited 10+ mins for our waitress, she brought out the wrong item (we were offered free beer but they only paid for 1 round in the end), and then after eating only 1/2 my dinner I asked for it to be boxed. Waitress comes back &amp;. says the busboy threw it all out!  Eeek! She did replace it but man, what a lot of mistakes! I know they r only 8 mod old. I hope they hire better , more experienced staff.

A little too done around the edges and doughy in the middle. We had the margarita,  Spinnacella, and a pepperoni for our ten year old son. They were all cooked the same. The ingredients were fresh and the potential is there, they just haven&#39;t hit their stride yet. We also had the calamari and an orzo seafood dish that was on special. Both were phenomenal. Both were pricey. The seafood was fresh and cooked perfectly. We got out of there at about $200 (we thought we were just heading out for a casual pizza and were all feeling a bit underdressed)  for six of us, with plenty to drink.  

I will not make the effort to go here again unless someone else suggests it. If I do go back I won&#39;t even order pizza and definitely wont bring any kids.

I had previously perused the pics on Yelp and like what I saw, so I was excited that I finally had the opportunity to try the place out.  
When we arrived, the place was almost empty.  It was early for dinner, probably around 5pm on a Sunday, but I was surprised by the empty seats, given the generous reviews on yelp.  We were told to sit wherever we&#39;d like, and we promptly chose a table for four near the window.  The service was good, but not terribly memorable.  I was there three weeks ago and I can&#39;t even recall the gender of our server.  
We started off with calamari, which I believe is usually a good benchmark for a place.  If you can&#39;t do something as traditional as calamari right, chances for a satisfying experience are slim to none.  Lucky for us, the calamari was delicious and the serving size was generous.  I only had three or four pieces, since I try to stay away from fried food, but I couldn&#39;t resist.  
I ordered the veggie pizza, which was also good.  It wasn&#39;t the greatest pizza I&#39;ve ever had, but I realized after this experience that I&#39;m not huge on the brick oven pizza.  What I liked the most about my pie was that they really put forth an effort with the veggies, there was an array of mushrooms, peppers, squash etc.  My boyfriend did not like his pizza and took home about three quarters of it.  He wasn&#39;t crazy about the place, but my other friends liked it.  No one was raving about their food, but we weren&#39;t terribly disappointed.  I&#39;d probably return with a friend if I was in the mood for this style of pizza, but I doubt we&#39;ll be booking a date here any time in the near future."

Our server was a hot mess, but what are you going to do.  She had a problem pouring the wine into a glass without spilling it every time &amp; she didn&#39;t like removing the empty plates from our table. We just placed them on the table next to us.

The first time my wife and I walked in and was told you should make a reservation even though the restaurant was sat at 50%.  The way she came across was very direct and rude especially the way she rushed to us from the bar area (an awkword spot for the host to great the customers).  

Well yesterday was my second encounter a Fathers day dinner with the family was no different again she rushed to meet us from bar with menus in hand and asked us if we had a reservation?  I responded yes, she never asked me for our name and sat us near the front door versus a much less traffic area.  When we entered the facility a four top was sitting in front of the windows and it looked as though a 12 top sat down the middle of the restaurant.  As members of the large table arrived the hostess must have known the customers because she smiled and sat each guests as they arrived.  The hostess acted like a hostess should act when greating customers as though she appreciated them coming in or they were friends.  As we sat there we noticed that it was not just us she was cold to each and every guests who entered that she did not know received the same cold welcome.

I like the food even though the calamari was half the order I received when it was just my wife and I 3 weeks ago.  I am writing the review because I am in the hospitallty business and know that you have one chance and one chance only to make a good first impression.  I fell that the hostes has made us unfortable twice and she maybe pushing business elesware.  The end result is that your staff makes or breaks your business and this hostess has caused us to go elseware, it&#39;s to bad because the chef does an excellant job."

In fact, I&#39;m still drooling over their little complimentary donut holes dunked in syrup and dusted with powdered sugar. Amaze-balls and addicting.

That being said, I tried to balance out my first meal of the day with a healthier option for the main event. Still had the sweet bug from the donut teaser though, so I decided to order their healthy french toast -- whole grain bread dipped in egg white batter that&#39;s grilled golden brown and served with fresh fruit on top.

I&#39;d be lying if I said this healthy french toast was as good as the regular french toast, but when trying to make a healthy decision it&#39;s a good option. While the toast itself was very good and the fruit super fresh, I have to admit I ended up dipping it in syrup because it was a tad dry. Guess I kinda killed the healthy part of it, but I mean hey... syrup is good!

It took a little while for someone to great us and take our food order, but once that was placed the food came out pretty quick. Our waitress was nice and refilled our waters and coffee often, however she did not remember who ordered what once the food was delivered. It was 8:00 in the morning though...

The seating is right on par, the openness of the table seating, height of the booths and the simplicity of condiments on the table really makes it easy to carry on a conversation without feeling claustrophobic like most breakfast joints.

So refreshing. I&#39;ll take it!

I was impressed that they used 4 cage free eggs in the omelette but disappointed I didn&#39;t get any of those pretty little donut holes I read so much about on yelp...

My husband had the Greek skillet. The veggies tasted fresh and the gyro meat was tasty -- I tried a few bites.

My sister-in-law ordered and egg white omelet with turkey and veggies and unfortunately ended up with regular eggs and turkey sausage. I guess this is a risk you take with take-out though. She&#39;s had very good experiences before.

Perfection. It comes with a bunch of fruit and choice of toast, and I always get pancakes. They&#39;re great, I&#39;m not sure what it is, but there&#39;s just a little extra something special about these pancakes. It could be the tray of jellies and syrups that&#39;s delivered to your table, which are stellar, but the pancakes are good on their own too.

My boyfriend got sick on Father&#39;s Day within 5 minutes of eating the skillet and had to go to the restroom. Not sure if the meat was properly cooked or not. After leaving the bathroom, he said he was fine and begin eating the skillet again and tasted the pancakes. 

So we leave heading home and he threw up all in the car while driving. It smelled just like the food he had recently consumed at the restaurant. What an awful experience."

The only thing good is here their waffle, but honestly, how could you mess up a waffle? I have been here about 5 times and that is because people after church sometimes like to go here.  Sometimes I join if I can&#39;t convince them otherwise.

The food here is not good.  The donut holes they bring out are ok, but this past time they were soggy and yuck!  Every time I come here, something is dirty, my fork or my knife or my cup.  Its gross!  Don&#39;t get me wrong, this place is very cute inside, but just isn&#39;t sanitary to me.  Do not even get me started on the omelet.  Who can&#39;t make an omelet?  By far the worst omelet ever.  I took a couple bites and was done with it.  Nothing about the meal stands out.  The hash browns are boring and are the same thing you can just pour in a pan from the bag in the frozen food section..blah!  I have given this place a couple attempts but every time the experience gets worse.  

The only reason they have 2 stars is because they at least can pull off a decent waffle.. to put on that dirty plate...SMH"

You will have no problem getting a table right away during the week. This place is great for large and small groups. 

You can spilt the almost all their breakfast entrees. I usually share the country fried steak or omelette. I had the cafe scrambler today. It&#39;s a pretty good size portion but in not sure it would be enough to share. I have only been here one time for lunch. The wrap and side was plenty to share with another person. 

I love the location, friendly staff, and menu variety. This is my favorite breakfast restaurant in the area!   Only thing that would make it better- serving mimosas or bloody Mary&#39;s but that&#39;s not a require for a great breakfast!!"

A friend an I made plan to grab brunch before work and jam n jelly was our best bet. Warning tho!** this review is for the Woodridge location. There is also another location(less cooler-just saying). 

So any who while my friend was waiting they offered her fresh homemade complimentary donut holes, which upon my arrival she devoured! I&#39;m a coffee addict, so I couldn&#39;t pass fresh cup of joe. I decided to switch it up and ordered a hazelnut coffee and boy was it one of the best decisions made! Shoutout to free refills on that bad boy. (I drank about 3 cups and asked for a cup to go) 

Now onto the food. OH MY GOODNESS! I ordered the stuffed French toast with peaches and it was pure bliss! Stuffed with cream cheese filling, lightly drizzled with syrup, perfectly toasted, and those peaches! I seriously have no words for how perfectly done those peaches were. 

Needless to say I&#39;ll be back sooner than you know it! I&#39;ve already told about 50 people about this place and made plans to head back.

Too bad because that was always a nice touch.  The choices for both breakfast and lunch are plentiful on their menu. I&#39;ve never had a bad meal here and they are accommodating if you need or want to make a change. I like their homemade jams, too. Service is always pretty good with friendly servers. However, this time, I asked for fresh fruit instead of hash browns with my egg white omelette and they forgot. Disconnect either with the server or kitchen staff.  My breakfast came with hash browns...I know if I had pointed out the mistake, they would have corrected their error.  The food is good and the prices fair.  I always go back, so it must be good!"

Like most breakfast spots, this place is hopping on the weekends. We got here just before the rush this past Saturday morning and were seated right away. Our waitress was extremely prompt and brought out some fresh doughballs. These were amazing, coated in syrup and lightly dusted with powdered sugar. I stopped at two but they were so light and fluffy, the whole cup wouldn&#39;t have been hard to eat!

I decided to get the Greek skillet and was happy that I was able to make some substitutions, that&#39;s the best part of breakfast anyway! The waitress gave us all the sides or condiments we could want and the meal was amazing. There was enough to take leftovers for another meal! Best of all my total was only $10. Quite a deal for all that food!

The coffee was good and they did a great job of keeping our cups filled.

They were super busy and as such, we received turtle slow service. We were sitting for about 20 minutes before our drink order was even taken. Then another 20 before our food order was taken. I ordered a Greek Skillet (gyro meat) with 2 sunny side up eggs and a side of pancakes. It was pretty tasty. The portion wasn&#39;t as big as I expected and I was able to finish all of it.  My hubby got the Bananas Foster w/ a side of pancakes. He liked it. I thought it was pretty good too.

Everyone&#39;s food came out except for my and my friend&#39;s side pancakes. When the server walked by, I told her &#34;We are still waiting for our pancakes&#34; but I said it the same time as when my husband asked for more coffee- so I wasn&#39;t sure if she heard me. She said &#34;Okay.&#34; So I tapped her as she walked by and said &#34;We are still waiting for our pancakes&#34; and she said &#34;Okay I&#39;ll check on them.&#34;

Then the bus boy comes by with ONE side of pancakes. I told him we were waiting for two sides of pancakes. He said &#34;Oh, they only told me one.&#34; So I told him to give them to my friend and said &#34;You can give her these ones and I&#39;ll wait for the next ones.&#34; He said &#34;Okay&#34; and walked away.

Once everyone at my table is completely done with their meals, my pancakes were still nowhere in sight. The waitress never even came to check on us so I kept an eye out for her. She finally walks past our table and I tap her on the shoulder as she is helping the table past us. I told her &#34;I&#39;m still waiting for my pancakes.&#34; and she said &#34;Really? Ugh I told him to bring them to you.&#34; So now she is blaming the bus boy I&#39;m assuming? Whatever, it&#39;s both their faults. But ultimately, it was her responsibility to check up on us and made sure we had everything we needed. Anyway, she ended up bringing me my pancakes (which I asked in a To-Go container) and she also brought my friend one. She thought she hadn&#39;t received her pancakes either so now my friend got 2 extra free pancakes. Plus for them. 

But clearly, this server needs to work on communicating with her team. I understand it was a busy time but really? I had to ask 4 times? I have a very specific routine when I eat brunch. I eat my pancakes first, then I pick at my skillet until I&#39;m super full. Then I usually have a whole meal&#39;s worth of skillet to eat for my dinner later. This time I had to eat my entire skillet at the restaurant and now I&#39;m waiting to eat refrigerated and microwaved pancakes for dinner. Can you tell I&#39;m super excited for that? Pancakes always taste great microwaved (SARCASM).

If it weren&#39;t for the service, I&#39;d consider coming back once in a while. But the service made me give this a 2 star and I will not drive 20 minutes to eat here again. I literally asked for my pancakes 4 times to 2 different people until I finally got them. That&#39;s just wrong."

There is nothing unusual about the menu.  It&#39;s your basic breakfast joint.  In my old age I feel like I&#39;m becoming a coffee snob.  This coffee was passable, but not great.  I stopped at just two cups, which for me is unusual.  

I ordered an Irish skillet.  The skillet had way too many potatoes, and I think the hash came from a can.  The whole dish was just OK.

They brought little donut holes to the table just like they do at Juicy O.  I know people love the donuts, but I can&#39;t see filling up on them when a huge breakfast is on the way.

I also purchased a Chicken Caprese Salad to take home - it was also very large but it was $12.95, kind of pricey for a salad, and it had maybe two pieces of basil in it.

I loved this new, open, clean and spacious lobby. High ceiling and all big windows on one side made the whole lobby bright and airy. I noticed they used kind of plank wood floor instead of carpet which looked clean and modern. I liked more than enough space between tables so my kids won&#39;t accidentally knock off others stuff. 

The extended menu made it very hard to choose. All looked so good. Kids got French Toast and Egg Platter. Adults chose Healthy egg scramble and Healthy French toast. Soon, our coffee was filled and kids got their fresh squeezed orange juice which I took a sip and almost asked a one for myself. Loved it.

Kids finished the complimentary Greek donut in no time before I even got a chance to try. Must be good then.

My egg scramble came with toasted muffin and three huge pieces of fruit. The healthy French toast are 8 thin sliced wheat bread with cholesterol free egg batter covered with fresh diced fruit. I liked the healthy toast better. Super tasty and minimal greasy with some homemade jelly.

 My daughter loved the sunny set up and my son liked the over hard. None of them liked the harsh brown which I guess they used to McDonald&#39;s greasy one. French toast with homemade jelly was a hit for them.

We received the wonderful services that day. Really nothing I could take any start away. Kids were sold on OJ and Greek donuts. We will come back pretty soon."

Taking into account that I am/was on paleo while coming here, I was able to get the lox omelette and substitute the has browns for fruit.  I normally have lox on a bagel, but I had to try the omelette version- delicious!  The fruit was nice and sweet - big fresh pieces of cantaloupe, honeydew, and pineapple, not the dinky little pieces that look like they were sitting in sugar water.  The only crappy thing was that there were a lot of flies in the restaurant - mainly because it was such a beautiful day out that servers had to keep going in and out from the outdoor seating.

I had a good experience, I would return.  I will probably come back when I&#39;m not on a diet to try to pancakes or even lunch to check out the consistency, but for now, I was happy with my experience."

The service was good, the waitress was pretty friendly and attentive.  My real problem was the food.  We came and ordered lunch items and I am wondering if breakfast is really where this place shines.  I ordered on of the Chicken Panini sandwiches and while it should have been good from reading the description, the sandwich was incredibly bland.  I found myself devouring my fries and getting through 1/2 of my sandwich by dumping a ton of salt on it to give it some flavor.  

The real kicker was that we took our sandwich leftovers home and almost immediately tossed them in the garbage can.  We knew we wouldn&#39;t ever eat them, so why take precious real estate in our refrigerator.  I might come back to try breakfast because it is so close...but no more chicken sandwiches."

We got there after the rush on a weekend (about an hour before they close)
Before I ordered asked first what they called a cooked egg white with runny yoke so I could get a correctly cooked egg. Unfortunately that didn&#39;t help.

Yesterday we were seated at the very last booth that is really only a half booth.  We visited with some people at another table and while we visited, another couple and their 2 children were seated at that same table.  Scratch that one.  We went back up front and were given a number.  There were open tables and 2 parties of 2 were seated while we waited.

Okay, we place our order.  If you have eaten here, you know they bring out the syrup and butter before the pancakes.  I did not notice there was no syrup until after the pancakes arrived.  Ah, the pancakes.  The butter was still sitting on top of them when we left ~ not even close to warm, much less hot.  Hash browns were also cold and half cooked.  I had to ask 2 different people for a straw.  I think they have brought in the employees from the previous place that just couldn&#39;t get it&#39;s act together.

This Sunday was the worst experience for us.  The place was slow.   All of the waitstaff were standing around talking to each other.

The Greek Omelette I ordered had lots of flavor and I was filled up after just a few bites. It had Feta, mushrooms, onions and tomatoes. The potatoes along side were my favorite kind: shredded, crispy hashbrowns. I opted for fruit instead of the pancakes on the side, and it consisted of fresh melon and pineapple.

My friend thoroughly enjoyed the Eggs Benedict. She said it rivals her favorite version of this dish which she gets at a café on vacation every year.

The kids had the bacon burger on a pretzel bun (a bit greasy), chicken fingers and pancakes. They have $5 kids meals which is nice.

Everyone enjoyed their meals and the server was friendly and attentive. We&#39;ll be back!"

On the plus side, they have a lot of choices on their menu. I&#39;ve been twice now and will go again. The food is freshly prepared, interesting and flavorful. Plus the price isn&#39;t bad. 

On the negative side, the service is a tad slow. At breakfast, Jimmy needs his coffee! LOL...and these guys don&#39;t seem to grasp that concept. The waiter wanders aimlessly with a coffee carafe and if I&#39;m lucky I&#39;ll get a refill or two. I&#39;d much prefer they leave the coffee with me like they do with the lemon-infused carafe of water and I can help myself.

The other negative is that it seems to take waaaayyyyyy too long to go from completion of meal to receiving the check to leaving the place. Seems to me that table turnover is a critical component to a restaurant&#39;s success and if I&#39;m languishing at my table for five or 10 minutes waiting and waiting for my check, it&#39;s not good for business. And it sure ain&#39;t good for me...I got things to do!

So in a nutshell, if you wanna try a place that has a wide variety of breakfast items ranging from crabcake Benedict to biscuits and gravy to some awesome omelets to some pretty tasty looking (I didn&#39;t have any - yet) salads, give Jam n Jelly a go. But just know that when you wanna roll out, odds are you&#39;ll be waiting a few extra minutes."

They weren&#39;t serving donut holes as reported by other reviewers.  The only reason this place didn&#39;t get five stars was because of the noise level.  It&#39;s very loud in there.

Not too expensive, plan to spend around $10

I tried the euro platter, and for a gyro fan like myself, it was delicious. Some of the gyro pieces were slightly overlooked but that&#39;s probably just my personal preference. Very yummy and perfect proportions. My friend got the Capri chicken panini, which he said was really good, and filling. It certainly looked good. My other friend had the Irish skillet, and the over-easy eggs soaking into the corned beef looked so good. He said it wasn&#39;t quite that filling, but then again, we did eat at 2pm. 

The restaurant itself was not crowded (2pm on Tuesday so no wonder) and the atmosphere was very friendly. I must go here again!"

Other items that are a must try are the tenderloin Benedict- it has a hollandaise sauce that is amazing, the cranberry French toast and the stuffed peach French toast and the avocado platter which is a chicken salad filled into an avocado!!

Okay... basically, three stars for food, one star for service. Our waiter was SO. RUDE. He was incredibly short and brusque with us while taking our orders and when the food came he literally tossed my pancakes across the table at me. He also made a snippy remark when my husband pointed out that there was ham on my plate (I&#39;d ordered a cheese-only omelet and he was concerned they&#39;d goofed up; they ultimately hadn&#39;t). And when the time came for the bill, he muttered his &#34;thanks&#34; after throwing the bill down on the table and walked away mid-sentence.

I swear to God we were friendly and polite to this guy! He was such a jerk.

The restaurant was reeeeally busy at brunchtime and the food is just average and when combined with the dreadful service, it&#39;s not worth the wait. It&#39;s too bad the far superior and once-nearby Granny&#39;s is gone because I would much rather have gone there for a yummy feta omelet."

This place is within walking distance of my apartment and I have been here close to a dozen times. Whenever we have friends in town we always end up getting breakfast or brunch here and our friends are always excited to go back. IT is called a cafe but has a updated diner feel to it and a very diner-ish menu, but with some significant upgrades. Looks very nice inside and when the whether is nice you have the option to sit outside which gives you the feel of eating downtown Chicago at a local place in your neighborhood. Every time I go I can&#39;t help myself and get either an omelette or skillet, I have tried several of them and they are all good and the ingredients range from Green Pepper to Lox(smoked salmon) and all of the eggs are Farm Raised, according to the menu. I have also had their country fried steak which of course was fantastic. Make sure that if your meal comes with pancakes you upgrade to one of their premium pancakes (everyone likes dessert after breakfast) like the Banana Walnut or Cinnamon Roll (actually their regular pancakes are some of the best I have ever had). This is by far my favorite breakfast spot and I will find it hard to try an other places in the area and I am sure when my friends visit they wont let me take them anywhere else either!!"

We have a son with a nut allergy, and the server went out of his way to ensure that his food was prepared without cross-contamination. 

Decor and ambience are perfect for a breather and a nice brunch, not too loud; not too squished, excellent vibe.

Actually, the Jam n&#39; Jelly cafe in Darien (Big Sister) did not do anything wrong, except become wildly popular and super crowded.  Good job, you are doing it right!

This brand new restaurant is conveniently located between the Lisle Metra station and my home.  I catch a train that hits Lisle at 7am and we usually are the first customers of the morning here. 

I love the use of the space, although some may label it as &#34;cold.&#34;  High, warehouse-like ceilings, metallic accent pieces adorning the walls, lots of high-backed comfy booths lining the windows.  My favorite feature though, is the counter-style seating near the register.  It is rare to find a place that caters to the single diner.  

Service has always been polite and prompt.  They bring a carafe of water with lemon to the table right away, and regularly check up on you throughout the meal.  (Always with a fresh, hot pot of good coffee, if that is your thing.)  One instance sticks out in my mind the most:  My husband ordered a sandwich at 7am, which includes a cup of soup (He is even more backwards than I am at times.) At first, our waiter was unsure if soup was ready, so he went to the kitchen to check.  Five minutes later, he comes out with some piping hot soup.  It may not seem like much, but both waiter and kitchen staff could easily have played Soup Nazi, and told him &#34;No soup for you!&#34;

The food here is as terrific as Big Sister&#39;s.  I did put this place to the &#34;Great Steak and Egg Challenge.&#34;  While it did not fail miserably, it was just not memorable. Oddly enough, the steak tasted much better chopped up in a skillet form.  Their skillets here are great, served up over chunk potatoes as opposed to hash browns.  Of course, if you get a meal with toast, be sure to sample some of their house made jams and jellies on the side!  I really love the plain crepes here as well; light and tasty, complimented best by a side of thick-cut and crispy bacon.  Oh my!  How could I have forgotten about the complimentary donut holes they bring to the table when you first sit down?  Light, fluffy and delicious rounds, with a bit of cinnamon and maple syrup!  (Speaking of maple syrup; that may be the only negative I have on this place- it comes to the table in a little metal jug, but it&#39;s always cold with that creepy film on top.)

All I have to say is, Little Sister keep on doing your thing, and I&#39;ll keep on coming back!"

Normally an easy going easy to please restaurant goer, was really annoyed with our experience. Came for Sunday brunch, the older woman who was seating people was plowing people over to get them seated, and no personality or friendliness.. She actually plowed into me on our way out which was icing on the cake for this experience.

The waitress was very rushed and lacked the friendly gene as well.. She&#39;d ask if we were doing ok and leave before we could answer. She even took my Dad&#39;s plate away while had food in his hand still eating, and we had the check all in the same plate grabbing moment. I think this isn&#39;t the best profession for her. Something a little less people orientated perhaps. 

The food... Meh. Wasn&#39;t impressed, wasn&#39;t horrible but wasn&#39;t anything I&#39;d come back for. Bummer.. Really wanted to like this place."

It was worth the wait! I visited Jam N Jelly yesterday for lunch with The Dude and my mom. The place was packed (always a good sign!) and we waited just a few minutes for a table. 

I was impressed by the extensiveness of the menu. I ended up choosing the crab cake eggs Benedict, which was delicious (but I would have liked the crab cakes to be just a wee bit bigger for $10.95). The Dude had the portabella focaccia sandwich and my mom picked the tuna melt. All of us were delighted with our meals. 

The decor in the restaurant is great also. It&#39;s modern, warm and welcoming. The servers are all very friendly and prompt - my coffee cup and water glass were never empty!

I think a little noise adds an attraction to a restaurant, defining it as popular and its patrons as having some level of fun and enjoyment. I dined there on a Friday night with three friends and yes it was crowded and at a high pitch but we had little trouble hearing each other&#39;s voices .

The menu, on the other hand, was pricey. Most dishes weigh in at about $22-$24.  Our tab for four people was about $160 (including tip) including four glasses of house wine and two Diet Cokes served in small glass bottles. So, we clocked in about $40-a-head. I would expect a restaurant of this caliber to be in the $20-$25-a-head range. 

The food was good but not exceptional, hence my 4-star rating. I had eggplant parmesan. Good, plenty of it, but just good. I tasted my friend&#39;s ravioli. Good, yeah, good. I was disappointed with the salad which comes with the price of the entre--or soup if you prefer. Nice greens rather artlessly stacked in a bowl with some sort of bottled dressing. My friends didn&#39;t think the salad dressing was bottled and I didn&#39;t ask. So maybe it was a bottled-flavored homemade dressing. 

Overall a likable restaurant. Worth a visit if the prices don&#39;t put you off."

Maybe a dozen tables or so, kind of cozy. The place had a nice warm vibe going for it. Service was friendly and prompt.
We ordered different dishes. Grilled Salmon, Chicken Vesuvio, and a special which was sausage, meatballs, braciole,(sp?) over pasta.
Had a problem with the salmon dish. The fish was way too strong tasting which led us to believe we got a bad piece of fish maybe past its freshness date.
They corrected the issue with the salmon dish right away so that is a plus and shows that they care about their customers experience, so kudos on that.

Also, the potatoes on the vesuvio dish had that made way earlier and then reheated later taste. 

The special pasta dish was alright, nothing remarkable but alright. It was a bit salty though and the pasta part of this dish was on the small side.

Another note: This place is not inexpensive on Italian food.

I wanted to like this place a lot more that I really did. I did not get wowed like a lot of the other reviewers, perhaps because I have some nicer places closer to me. However, I am not hesitant to give them another try.

Cheers to all"

I don&#39;t care for tomato (and am not much of a garlic fan), so I ordered the spaghetti carbonara with sides of sausage and vegetables.  The carbonara was excellent, the vegetables sauteed just the right amount, and the sausage was zesty and anise-y.   Coffee had good flavor and the dinner salad had good greens in it and a tasty balsamic dressing.   The bread was crisp/chewy on the outside and soft inside and was delicious with the olive oil and grated cheese.

My wife, a big tomato fan, ordered the lasagna vegetale and found it to be satisfactory in every way.  She also inhaled the bruschetta with gusto.   

The noise level was conversation friendly.  When we arrived there were three tables occupied by quiet eaters.  When we left, two large family groups (one with an adult table and a kid table) had arrived, so the noise level went up.  Conversation was still very possible though.  

Service was brisque - brisk and verging on brusque.  Everything was done efficiently and professionally.    

One caution: We were here in early March when the outside temp was in the upper 30s.   It was also a little chilly inside.  Some diners were wearing their outdoor jackets, and everyone had a sturdy top of some kind on.  No spaghetti straps in sight!   It did warm up significantly during the time we were there, and during the evening would certainly reach a more comfortable temperature"

I reached out and she assured me that this was THE spot for a fabulous Italian dinner. Fast forward 24 days and we made the trip to Glen Ellyn. 

Parking is kinda a pain. We circled the block a few times. First we circled to find the restaurant as it doesn&#39;t really jump out at you in the dark. Then we circled to find an empty spot. Any spot. We got lucky and made our way to the door. 

It&#39;s Friday night at about 6:15pm and when we walk in, the restaurant was pretty crowded. A few people were waiting. Birthday dinners were happening and the staff was busily moving about keeping the whole place in constant motion. There were infants all the way to probably ninety-something&#39;s. Everyone and their brother (and their uncles and their mamas and their cousins) seemed to be here for dinner. So when our wait was only about ten minutes, I was pleasantly surprised.

We were seated smack dab in the middle of the restaurant. Between the two of us, we could see everything. This is a cozy establishment, so keep that in mind when planning your visit. I don&#39;t envision strollers fitting. Even my purse was in the way the entire time.

The menu had a nice variety of appetizers, plenty of pasta choices, chicken, veal, seafood, etc. There was a handwritten specials page and we both stuck to that page. I had the Trio Napolitano and he chose stuffed shells with a bolognese sauce. We had the choice of soup or salad. We both chose the chicken with rice soup. 

So let&#39;s talk about the food. The bread basket arrived with butter and country crock. There was olive oil on the table. The bread was good. It was room temperature but tasted pretty fresh. The soup. We both thoroughly enjoyed the soup. The base was a chicken stock, not creamy. The rice was perfectly cooked, chicken shredded and the whole bowl perfectly seasoned. I always add pepper, but more out of habit than necessity. That bowl of hot soup really hit the spot!  His stuffed shells.... He ate them all and did not offer me a bite. He&#39;s not usually a huge eater, but he did say that dinner was very good. My trio consisted of homemade braciole, a large meatball and a piece of sausage over the chef&#39;s choice of pasta. The braciole was fantastic!  Tender, rolled beautifully and not loaded with cheese which makes me happy. The meatball was firm and loaded with flavor. The sausage was pushed to the side after one bite. It wasn&#39;t my favorite. They make a chunky tomato sauce and use fresh herbs. The pasta confused me. On the regular menu, I was pretty sure that I read about homemade pasta. On the special menu, the pasta for my entree was chef&#39;s choice. I should have asked when I ordered, but I was expecting a homemade pasta. This was not. That was disappointing. Also, the focus was definitely on the meat as the pasta was minimal.  I was fine with that, but thought it&#39;s worth mentioning. We took a slice of tiramisu home. This was a nice portion. I really enjoyed this treat!

A few other things to mention...

It&#39;s crazy loud in here. It&#39;s a small place which I loved, but it was so loud that we couldn&#39;t enjoy a conversation and kept saying &#34;what?&#34; to each other so we gave up and played on our phones. 

If you like personal space, this is in short supply. On a crowded Friday night, I was bumped into and bumping into others the entire time. 

The service. Our server was fine.  He made no suggestions and kinda talked to us while looking around the restaurant. We weren&#39;t quite sure he was actually addressing us a couple times. I&#39;m hoping it&#39;s because they were so busy. But the busboy...he was amazing!!  Water glasses never more than half empty. Empty dishes cleared almost immediately. It was like he had a radar and knew just when to swing over!

So I&#39;m really all over the board on this one. I&#39;m going four stars because had we gone on a Monday or Tuesday evening, I think we would have avoided the throng of people which added a whole other element to our dinner. I&#39;m definitely going back with the intent on getting some of that homemade pasta and more meatballs."

I wanted somewhere small, comfortable, nice, and Italian sounded good! I thought of Made in Italy Trattoria, mentioned a week or so ago by my mother. Located in downtown Glen Ellyn near the train station (next to that florist shop), M.I. I. T. (not typing that whole thing again) is a tiny little restaurant that one might easily bypass if they weren&#39;t paying attention. Parking is predominantly street parking, but we had no hassle. 
    Upon walking in, we were greeted by a man who I think may&#39;ve been the owner, and he was also our server for the evening. He was a sweet, funny, happy Italian guy, who referred to me as Princess (how did he know?!) the whole night and you would&#39;ve thought him and my man were best buds. The décor is charming. I felt like I was at the Italian restaurant in Lady and the Tramp... so naturally I started singing the song... with checked table clothes, kind of a café feel, classic (semi-stereotypical sounding) Italian music, with the back done up as if it was mom&#39;s kitchen. 
    As I mentioned above, I liked our server. He was attentive, informative, and said if I wanted anything whether it was on the menu or not, he&#39;d make it (even if it meant running to the grocery store) ^_^ hehe. I think he wanted us to have a nice date night, and he did a wonderful job of it.
    The food was good, and you get a little bread basket to start. I thought it was going to be a little pricier but it wasn&#39;t bad! Depending on what you got, you were looking at around $18-30 a plate maybe... I got what was called the Made in Italy: chicken and shrimp in a marsala sauce, pasta, and fresh spinach. My boyfriend got a sort of fettuccini looking dish with shrimp and a nice flavorful sauce (forgot the name of the dish). For dessert we got the chocolate mousse cake. Tasty! Oh, by the way, they have good peach tea. They also have a good selection of beer and, of course, wine!
    Definitely worth giving this place a try. I know some people have the feeling of liking it but not yet having the &#34;it&#39;s great&#34; feeling kick in yet. If that&#39;s you, try again."

Had to agree with Trip O&#39;s review.... I wanted to like this place, servers were nice, decoration was cozy, but the food failed.  Everything is way too salty and greasy, if they took away half of the sauce, half of the cheese or oil it would have been much better. 

Very disappointed to be honest. I&#39;m not familiar with food in Glen Ellyn area, but there are many places out there suburb or in the city who makes way better italian dishes."

Everything about it communicates authentic Italian: the decor,  the size, the tablecloths, and the...well, Italians running the place. 

I love variety. But when I go to Made in Italy, I rarely stray from the formula: house salad, Rigatoni  (or some other pasta) Toscano, and chianti...DONE.

The homemade pasta sets their dishes apart from most places, always cooked with the perfect slightly al dente texture. The sauces balance American-style Italian rich comfort with classic old country freshness. We&#39;ve only had dessert once, a tiramisu that was a bit too milky. 

Made in Italy has a welcoming feel, and not in a smothering, obnoxious way. You will want to go back regularly."

Walking past and peeking in the window last week I definitely thought I GOTTA GO so it&#39;s kinda funny my reaction to actually being there isn&#39;t so immediate.  I loved the space.  Quite charming inside...a sort of combination of feeling like you&#39;re on an old Italian street orrrrr in an old Italian kitchen.  Checked cloth tables...nothing fussy...relaxed, friendly service...

As for the food...  Bread appeared immediately.  Just ordinary.  There were butter and Country Crock (eew) packets in the basket and olive oil and Parmesan cheese on the table.  We had the zucchini puff appetizer.  Very light and nice.  They brought us some complimentary bruschetta.  Also good but I don&#39;t know that I&#39;d be prompted to order it.  I really enjoyed the salad.  (meals come with soup or salad)  For our meals we each had a dish that featured shrimp, pasta and spinach.  Our sauces and the type of pasta varied.  Both very good.

This is an enjoyable place...very chill atmosphere.  The bathroom smelled nice - lol.  A lot of people brought young children but it wasn&#39;t like a kiddie place.  They didn&#39;t have a specific kids menu so that tells me that they do some nice and reasonably priced splitting for the young ones and that the clientele are nice parents.  Were it not for their shortness you never would have known kids were around.  ;-)

One thing I didn&#39;t like is that the stuff on the table...the salt &amp; pepper shakers, the oil and the candle...all were a bit dirty.  When I touch something on my table I don&#39;t want to feel the imprint of the ten hands that were before me, y&#39;know?  This place is too nice to be missing that detail."

I had heard good recommendations for it from friends when it first opened, but we had never worked it into the rotation.  In the mood to try something different yesterday, we finally made our way over.  

They did not take reservations, but we got there relatively early at 6:30 and though the place was almost full, we got one of the last two open tables.  The dining room is one open room, and doesn&#39;t have a lot of ambiance, but it was nice and well laid out  

My wife had the minestrone soup and i had the chicken &amp; rice soup.  Both were great with lots of flavor.  For dinner, my wife had a veal marsala and i had ricotta stuffed shells in meat sauce with an add on of meatballs.  All was very good.  The sauce and the meatballs in particular had a ton of flavor.  Some of the best italian food i&#39;ve had in quite a while.  

To finish off we had the chocolate mouse cake.  it was very tasty.

To pair with dinner, we had a Sensi Cabernet Tuscan.  Probably not my favortie cabernet i&#39;ve ever had, but it was fine.  

Wait staff was very professional and did a good job of being keeping tabs on us.

Overall, this was a great experience for us with the key ingredients of good, flavorful food and great service that will have us coming back for more."

We started off with appetizers, then had soup and salad then followed by our main course. The ingredients are fresh! The food is authentic Italian made to perfection! There is many menu options to choose from and such a great wine selection it&#39;s hard to settle on a decision as this is way beyond just your basic Italian food. You can order wine by the glass or the bottle. We never made it to dessert as we were so full from our dinner but that&#39;s on my list for next time as the desserts looked so delicious! Everyone at our table of 5 loved their dining experience. Great food presentation, phenomenal authentic Italian food cooked to perfection, and a great neighborhood friendly atmosphere.  I love the fact it is close (we live in lombard)  and that it is  right here locally in downtown Glen Ellyn. There are many Italians in my family that can cook and I know this would be  the place to impress them! I will be back with both my family and friends!!

I would have been uncomfortable if there were no other guests in the room. There was 12 tables, maximum. And no ambient noise or music.

The server was attentive`enough.

Burrata was fine with some nice prosciutto .  Of the 6 dinners I had the best. The veal shank was okay, a little tough and heavy with salt. My nephew had a dish they listed under seafood. It was chicken and shrimp over angel hair pasta. There was a single thin breast with two shrimp about the size of 25-30. This dish cost over twenty some dollars. Not bad for a food cost of maybe $3.00. I won&#39;t bore you with the other mediocre plates. Service was incredibly slow.

We didn&#39;t have to wait for a table but the dining room was full. We ordered two pasta dishes even though we normally share one(we&#39;re light eaters). This place has a split plate charge because of the soup/salad that comes with dinner so we chose two different pastas. They were both tasty. Pasta was cooked well. It just was missing something. Professional wait staff? And if you aren&#39;t going to offer good bread, don&#39;t offer it at all. For the same cost, I&#39;d rather have dinner at Fire and Wine."

Selected this restaurant based upon the Yelp reviews.  Luckily, it was only 5:20pm and we were seated immediately, with a few more tables open.  However, within the next 30-40 minutes, the place had a line of people waiting.  It&#39;s not a big dining room.  It&#39;s a charming and cozy place.

My hubby ordered the osso buco.   Without a doubt, this meat would have significantly benefited from another few hours of braising.  It wasn&#39;t underdone, from a food safety standpoint, but it was not as tender as it should have been. The potatoes, accompanying his veal shank, were also slightly under-cooked...but the flavor was amazing!

I ordered the eggplant parmesan.  Again, I was surprised to find the eggplant slightly undercooked.  The flavors were excellent. I enjoyed their red sauce.

Our son had basic pasta with meat sauce and a meatball - delicious!  He&#39;s young but a big eater, so we ordered a half-order of the adult portion.  We had plenty to take home!  Good sized portions.

The gentleman who was (most likely) the owner was warm &amp; friendly, and treated our 7 yr old like a little Prince.  This *always* makes us so much more relaxed...knowing that our kids are welcomed, rather than considered a nuisance!  The service was very good and we enjoyed a lovely bottle of wine from their decent wine list.

Based upon the atmosphere and general quality, I would like to try this restaurant again in hopes that our undercooked experience was an unusual, one-time occurrence. Again -- the flavors were wonderful, so I feel a bit guilty awarding only 2 stars.  If the food had been better cooked, I would have loved this place and would have awarded 4 stars."

My husband had the special of tilapia and it was served on a bed of watery penne with a buttery sauce and what seemed to be frozen vegetables (tough outer skin) on top.  That said my children enjoyed their cheese ravioli (hard to mess up). Needless to say we won&#39;t be returning. With options like Vitorio&#39;s and Marinella&#39;s nearby why would we??

My boyfriend and I decided to try the next one on our list. Upon arrival, you walk into a small but cute and cozy restaurant that kind of reminds you of the Italian spaghetti restaurant in &#34;The Lady and the Tramp&#34;, including the tables. We were greeted instantly and the waiter was attentive and explained some dishes to us because this really is an authentic Italian restaurant. If you are looking for an Olive Garden dish, you are in for a huge treat and for the exact same prices! For our wine, my boyfriend ordered the Shiraz and I ordered a succulent dry red wine (which for the life of me, I can&#39;t remember), but it was an 8 dollar Italian red wine glass. Wow! After one glass, we were on top of the world, and after two, well.... what happens in Rome stays in Rome! For our entrees, I ordered the Risotto Campagniolo and my boyfriend ordered the Vitello Connellani. Both dishes were phenomenal. Even my boyfriend who likes to order new things, but regrets it afterwards because he is more of a cheese ravioli guy, loved it. Word of advice though, on the menu, it does not state that the risotto comes in a white creamy sauce. I would not have ordered it if I had known that, because white creamy sauces upset my stomach, but their sauce was so homemade that it did not sit in your stomach. Overall our experience was romantic and pleasantful. However, we did split our bill with half of a debit card and half cash, and there would have been two dollars left over from the cash, and we never told our server to keep the change because I was going to leave him a tip on my card and my boyfriend was going to leave him extra in cash. He kept the two dollars and returned my card and did not say thank you as though he thought we were only going to tip him two dollars and when we said goodbye he did not respond ( we were not sure if it was because the restaurant was now busy or because he was upset about what he believed was going to be his tip that he was acting this way). In the end we left him a nice and hefty tip because we truly loved this place! Highly recommended!"

All in all go to b dubs instead of waising money here 

Deviled eggs: ok theres alot that comes in an order. It has way to much mustard didnt think somebody can ruin deviled eggs. 

Angus burger: it was cooked good but so bland it tasted like nothing i put a bunch of salt and nothing. I could tell the fries were old they tasted bad and were greesy.

I purposely have been avoiding them due to their less than stellar reviews and my previous experiences filled with large crowds, boring drinks, and average food. I used to think the only thing Jimmy&#39;s Grill had going for them was their prime time downtown Nape location with a large outdoor patio. Well, not anymore folks!

Of course Jimmy&#39;s lured me in again with their awesome patio and I came in with pretty low expectations. I honestly was just looking for a spot outside to get something to drink and work on my laptop. Keep in mind, they don&#39;t have wifi available to guests. You can try connecting to Barnes &amp; Noble&#39;s wifi, but the connection might not be great. I luckily had a verizon stick I could plug in.

I was pleasantly surprised when I sat down and perused the menu! Tons of craft beers, whiskey, and cocktails to choose from. Well well well...this is not the PRB bucket special Jimmy&#39;s I remember! Although I wasn&#39;t hungry, I couldn&#39;t help but glance around me and take in all the smells of the patio. Everyone&#39;s food looked delicious! So much so that I came back later that night with my husband for dinner...

We again sat outside. Our server was really funny and helped us out with menu options. My hubbie indulged in a couple old fashioned cocktails and I tried their strawberry blonde and bourbon mule cocktails. Both were really tasty and pretty! Highly suggest exploring the cocktail and whiskey menu.

To start, we ordered the tuna tar tar which was awesome. Tuna, avocado, red onions, siracha and wonton strips to dip. Yum!

For my meal I ordered the pesto pasta with shrimp which caught my eye earlier in the day. This pasta dish had red peppers, mushrooms, and a perfectly balanced pesto sauce. I added the shrimp which is an extra cost but well worth it. The portion was spot on as well!

My husband ordered the turkey burger with a side salad. I gave his burger a bite and it was pretty good! I love that it comes with a cranberry spread. His side salad however was pretty sad. He doesn&#39;t like tomatoes so he tossed them in my pasta which left him literally just with lettuce.

Overall a great experience. Way to up your game Jimmy&#39;s - hats off to the chef! My only complaint was the price of the cocktails. A little high for my liking especially in the burbs."

I walked in and was immediately welcomed by the host at the front door. She took us to a table on the patio. The server was very busy but she stopped and said she would be back right away. That gave us time to decide what we wanted to order. 

We ordered a beer and the dynamite shrimp appetizer. I have an allergy and asked her to check on something. She checked on it and placed the order right away. I could not believe how fast the appetizer was brought to our table. It was hot and had great flavor--would defiantly order it again. 

Our server was there when the beers were almost empty to see if we needed another one. We were going to a few other places so we asked for the check. 

Overall--welcoming/accommodating staff &amp; great food and beer. I know I will be back for the Bloody Mary bar next time!!"

We came at a slow time. The place is mostly empty and we waited a long time for our meal. The waiter was fine. No great or horrible. The location is so great and this place has been here for a very long time but I&#39;ve only been here a handful of times and never that great. The food was good. Sliders were good.

We were in on one of the first really nice Saturdays of the spring and the place was packed.  It was about an hour and half wait for a table, but we were able to seat immediately at the bar.  The craft beer list is decent, and the food we ordered (which was a few sliders and fries) was delicious.  The food came quickly even though they were so busy, and the bartender was still pretty attentive to us, even though I don&#39;t think he was able to catch his breath the entire time we were there.

I was a fan back when the menu was mostly burgers, wraps, and decent domestic bottled beer specials.  Crowded almost every night of the week, Jimmy&#39;s patio was the place to be in the summer, and I threw up in their bathroom during a bar crawl one year.  From what I remember, they were pretty nice to me when they kicked me out.

Over the years, the menu had changed, the employees weren&#39;t as friendly, and I wasn&#39;t interested in going back.

In the last year it appears Jimmy&#39;s turned a new page.  I noticed some positive reviews from the reliable Candice and Jacqueline, so we decided to give Jimmy&#39;s a try once again.

The patio is still that prime real estate in downtown Naperville, and a delight on sunny days.  I had the Raspberry Lemondrop and LOVED it.  I ordered the Cuban sandwich, which came with fries, it was pretty good.  I&#39;m still not 100% sold on the menu, as the prices are a tad inflated still.  But I enjoyed my lunch here nonetheless."

The biggest and only plus is theur awesome location. Food quality left a bit to be desired. Our waitress was inattentive at best and eas visibly annoyed when we asked to split the check. Ive worked in food before it&#39;s not the most fun to split the check I know but it&#39;s what youre paid to do and can all be avoided if you just ask beforehand. Also one of the reasons I can understand why service was lousy was because it was a few weekends back and was pretty nice outside and it was obviously understaffed. It was a Saturday too, so the management should have better prepared for large crowds. Location was awesome but you need more than that to get me to return."

I was pleasantly surprised with my new June of 2014 experience. The menu was completely different, the beer list was vastly improved from the days of on-special Labatt Blue drafts. This time around my pops and I got some solid Solemn Oath and Half Acre brew and there was a whole chalkboard of other high-caliber and local beers available. 

We came on a sunny Saturday afternoon that was just about perfect. We&#39;d walked around town for a bit and since any kind of light-to-moderate exercise exhausts me, I was feeling kind of sweaty so we sat inside in the AC at a high-top bar table, but the patio looked lovely as well and they have some pretty massive flat screens rigged up outside so you could still catch the World Cup or whatever other sport-ball game is popular during x season. At the time they didn&#39;t have any umbrellas outside so everyone out there was just soaking up the sun&#39;s rays, which sounds nice but on really hot days it probably isn&#39;t the most desirable for customers and/or servers. 

It wasn&#39;t crowded at all and they seemed to be well-staffed so every table appeared to be taken care of nicely. Our server was really patient as I went hog wild on changing their regular menu items to what I wanted them to be. What I actually ordered was a combination of their Seared Tuna Salad and their Steak Salad... but basically I just subbed steak for tuna and got the dressing on the side. 

My salad was great, albeit def a bit pricey at $14, but I guess when you have the largest patio real-estate in downtown Naperville you can get away with charging a bit extra on dishes, and that makes sense to me. The tuna on the salad wasn&#39;t really what I had in mind - I was hoping for it to be more raw and just lightly seared, with that ruby-red color in the thick of the middle, but this was cooked throughout and semi-dry (def not the caliber I&#39;d like for it to be on a $14 salad) but with the dressing added in, it actually did work. 

We also got an order of their vinegar chips which sadly tasted nothing like vinegar and to me tasted either stale or burnt to hell, but my Dad seemed to enjoy them enough... me, not so much. 

Overall we had a great dining experience and left stuffed. They went from being a place I used to steer clear of, to a place I&#39;d totally have a casual beer and snack at on the reg."

We were in town for a wedding and headed into downtown Naperville for a drink &amp; a bite. We were drawn to Jimmy&#39;s for the gigantic patio out front to people watch. It was an amazing day yesterday, so there was a short wait of 15 minutes. 

We grabbed a drink while we waited, and then a host brought us outside. Since we had to get back for the wedding, we had just enough time to eat a few apps and split. NOBODY came to our wobbly high top table for over 15 minutes. We were all chatting and had our drinks from inside so we waited, if we hadn&#39;t had anything in our hands we would never have waited that long. The time wasted waiting there killed our chance to eat before the reception, so we had to go. On the way out, nobody (not even the hostess who sat us) asked why we were leaving. I left the menus at the host stand and we walked out. 

Incredibly understaffed. A girl was taking tables on opposite sides of the 100 foot patio, the rest of the servers were running around as if overwhelmed. Inside was empty, so 3 or 4 servers should have been able to handle the patio. Chalk this one up to management not having enough bodies on for a gorgeous day. Seemed like anybody who had gotten service here were also just sitting around waiting for their checks. 

Shame, cool location - but even if I went back to Naperville I would never give this place another shot."

I always knew it as a rowdy bar, with motorcycles lined up outside during the summer and well frankly... it just didn&#39;t seem like my kind of place. But they apparently have revamped the place with a new menu and management. 
After visiting the open house at Naper Settlement for our upcoming December wedding, the fiance suggested we stop in for a Bloody Mary. I&#39;m not one to turn down a Bloody, so off we went. 

We asked to be seated in a booth, which we were granted. It was a little after 3 p.m. on a Sunday afternoon and the place was relatively empty, so they had no issue accomodating our request. The first thing I noticed was the Bloody Mary bar setup. And yes, we were seated right next to it! We immediately decided to partake in their $5 Bloody Mary bar option, which is available on Sundays from 11 a.m. until 4 p.m. 
We were brought two glasses with a generous amount of vodka in them, and took off to make our drinks.

The Bloody Mary bar has a variety of hot and steak sauces, among other tasty treats. Garnishes include pepperjack and cheddar cheese cubes, lemon and lime wedges, pickle spears, celery stalks, olives, and a few other items. You also have a choice between three different types of Bloody Mary mixes. It was fun to create our own drinks; we both ended up making two each during our visit.

I had dinner planned that night, so we opted for either appetizers or a light entree. I decided upon the Duck Tacos (2), which come topped with cherry, chipotle, sour cream, and an apple/jicama slaw. The fiance chose a Three Cheese flatbread, which has mozzarella, parmesan, goat cheese, pesto, tomato, and basil. Not a fan of tomato, he ordered his flatbread without them.

Our food arrived in a relatively short time. His flatbread, while smelling heavenly, was quite burn on the edges. Still edible, but he was disappointed. My tacos were good. I mean, I&#39;ve never had duck so I don&#39;t know how it&#39;s suppose to taste (like chicken?). They were fun to try, but I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d get them again. 

For those of you with a sweet tooth, they feature desserts from Chef Terrell Cole of Dark Horse Pastries. Their meats are of the grass fed variety; their chicken is free range and they boast fresh seafood. The prices are about what you&#39;d expect to pay in Naperville for similar items. 

Overall, our waiter (I&#39;ve forgotten his name) was wonderful- he checked up on us often enough, but not too much where he was being a pest. The Bloody Mary bar was fun, and their menu has interesting options. It was a pricey outing though, so if we go back, it won&#39;t be until well after our wedding."

Before going I looked at the reviews and started to have some concerns regarding the service we may get.  I must say we couldn&#39;t have asked for any better service.  The girl that was taking care of us did an excellent job and couldn&#39;t have been more pleasant or attentive.  I will say this though, we arrived about 4:45 and as we were walking to the restaurant there were quite a few of the employees hanging outside on the sidewalk smoking and a few did not seem exited to be at work and if they carried that attitude into the building I can see where it could generate some of the past reviews.  As far as the food goes, overall I would say fair to good.  We had the Loaded Fries (Very Good) and the Hummus (Good) for appetizers for the group.  For Dinner I had the Pork Belly Grilled Cheese (Fair) and a side of Brussels Sprouts (Good).  As far as the sandwich goes for $12 I just expected better.  The Sourdough Bread was good and so was the Onion Marmalade but their choice of cheese (seemed like basic Kraft Singles to me) and lack of pork belly somewhat disappointed me.  I will also say the bread could have been cooked a little longer.  The Brussels Sprouts were good but not outstanding.  Salad and dressing was OK (pretty much standard salad).  Odds of me returning - If someone wants to go here I will join them, but it is not somewhere I will make a special trip to, especially since it about 30-40 minute drive from home for me.  If I am in the area there are a lot of other restaurants I would like to try before I would return."

My boyfriend and I decided to take a night out to celebrate my recent raise and, based on the cocktail menu, chose Jimmy&#39;s Grill. 

We recently relocated to the area from Chicago. Comparatively, the food prices are what you would expect in a nice-ish restaurant in Chicago. The cocktail prices were significantly less. He had a Gumball Head beer; I had a peach Grey Goose martini for $6. I am used to shelling out at least $12. My salad, the PEARadise, was $10. I felt it was a little heavy handed with the dressing, but overall really delicious. He had the Picasso burger with all the extras which ended up putting it at about $18. His was tasty, but not enough food. He was finished long before I was and still hungry. So we ordered desert. WOW! I had the peanut butter pie and he had and lemon tart. Both were out of this world delicious. 

For cocktails, dinner, desert, and tip we came in under $80. We look forward to going back and trying more of the menu.

FYI: So loud. This place is so terribly loud. There is wood, stone, and brick. Even the table are granite so there is little sound absorption and it all just echoes and amplifies. Also, despite being of higher caliber than what you would expect from a sports bar, it does have that sports bar feel. That&#39;s not really my scene. We will be back; we just have to time it for when there are no big sport events."

This place is pretty gross.

The last meal I ever had there was last summer on the patio...a salad.  The plate was dirty and if that wasn&#39;t enough, there was a big, black, curly hair smack dab in the middle.  I pointed it out to our waitress and she quickly moved to replace it.  New salad...clean plate...got to the bottom and....WHAT&#39;S THIS???  It was THE HAIR.  She had simply flipped my old salad onto a clean plate.  I circled it with my finger in the dressing and wrote &#34;WTF&#34; next to it.  Oddly, our bill never came.

There were a lot of families at this time - although I know that at night, I&#39;ve seen this place overcrowded with college-aged kids (I can say call them kids, I&#39;m 40+).  

Anyway, everyone at our table ordered burgers, with slightly different toppings.  Gotta say, watch out if you plan on getting additional toppings - there is a charge - if you&#39;re not careful, you may end up with a $20 burger.  

As far as the taste, everyone at the table agreed that the burgers were very, very good.  I had cheddar and bacon on my Angus burger.  It was cooked perfectly, the cheese and bacon were delicious.  The only thing is that it seemed a bit small for a $10+ burger.  This price would get me a monster burger, of equally good taste, at some of my favorite burger places in the City.  Nevertheless, it was really good.  The fries and vinegar chips were ok - definitely nothing to write home about - but not bad either.

With the outdoor area, and the location on Washington, I so wanted to like Jimmy&#39;s .  Sadly, we just had our third and final visit and noted the recurring themes.  Poor management, bad wait staff, and mediocre to poor food.  After much waiting, we ordered an order of onion rings and two beers.  He came back without the beers and asked if we were ready to order.  We said we will start with the onion rings we just ordered and our beers.  He comes out with beers and has the wrong one for my wife.  So he goes to fix that and then comes back with her beer.  Onion rings come out by a food runner and they looked great.  Problem is they were cold but we were hungry and decided it would take forever to fix.  Of course, no check back, so we flag him down and ask for the bill.  He drops it off and I say thanks and he retorts, &#34;yeah.&#34;  I had lots of small bills so paid in cash so we could get out of there.  So many better places in downtown Naperville.  Avoid!"

We ordered honey mustard instead, they didn&#39;t bring it out until we asked for it a second time about 10 more mins later. Then we finally started eating the chicken and the inside was raw. Thankfully the manager apologized after we asked to speak to her and she did take it off of our bill.

There is a large outdoor area, a bar area, and an eating area - the place may appear small from the outside but it&#39;s a pretty decent sized place.

As for my visits here - they&#39;ve only been in the winter.  I came here once for a greasy New Years day cheeseburger...I wouldn&#39;t say they have the best burgers in town but they were fine.  You can get coupons for this place sometimes in the local clipper magazine.  My second visit was this past weekend, being St Patrick&#39;s Day weekend...the staff were great, the place wasn&#39;t too packed, and they even poured our cans of Miller Lite into pint glasses and made us green beer!

All kind of servers walking past our table not saying a word to us. Next thing you know 30 minutes goes by and still nothing. So I left and on my way out, I told one of the guys by the door.

Food:
Jimmy&#39;s is trying to turn a sports bar into a regular restaurant but still keeping the sports bar atmosphere. It is not working. Everything but the beer is overpriced. The ONLY reason I come here is to have their craft beer selection. It is $12 for a regular burger and $10 for crappy hummus. Don&#39;t eat here just drink here if that. 

Sports:
Watching sports has also been a complete bust here. I went to watch Game 2 of the Blackhawks  vs Lightening and the projector was all messed up. It was giving us a headache and I asked the hostess and our waitress to have someone fix it. No one went to fix the projector after 40 minutes. I was sitting right under it and I could not believe it. There are 4 TVs in the corners of the main dinning area but it isn&#39;t pleasant to look up and watch the TVs especially when you are facing the projector. 

I would recommend you avoid jimmy&#39;s if you want to save money and not be pissed off from poor service and overpriced food. You can find good beer somewhere else. Trust me."

Service is hit or miss. Sometimes you&#39;ll get a spot-on server but several times I feel like my server had too many tables because he/she would disappear for a while and then run back, give us our food and run away again.  It made me a bit stressed.

I preferred their old menu.  I feel like it had more options and most of what I had was good, not great.  I also think (not sure) that they did away with their Sunday brunch and bloody mary bar.  Doing away with a bloody mary bar makes me very sad indeed.

The reason for 3 stars is because they have the absolute best patio to people watch in the summertime.  And, the bikers line their bikes up out front so it looks way cool and I pretend I&#39;m a hipster. ;-)"

Points for effort. They are under new management and recently revamped their menu, but the food is tastier, but still mediocre. Biggest gripe--the portion to cost ratio is off. 

For instance, their mahi fish tacos; you&#39;ll receive a big plate with three small tacos (simply one small piece of fried fish and some marinated cabbage), some dipping sauce and...that&#39;s it. No rice. No beans. It&#39;s appetizer sized at best. Also, the corn tortillas were straight out of the package and not warmed (guys, you have to warm them or they break and fall apart). $13? C&#39;mon. 

Same day...How about a simple Cobb salad? Boring, dry, bland. No unique touch. Not even a good dressing. Costly. 

My buddy had a burger and fries which looked appetizing, however he pointed out the bun was dry and the meat was overcooked. He liked the fries. Very typical.

An unrelated take-out lunch: Tomato basil soup: runny and flavorless. Close to hot tomato juice. $8?!? Bartender was unfriendly and put out by my presence. 

We had high hopes and have tried, and re-tried Jimmy&#39;s, but it still isn&#39;t cutting the mustard. Adjust the costs and it might be worth a nice day or evening on their patio."

We&#39;ve eaten here quite a few times, our meals have always been delicious.  Our staples are the grilled mahi mahi tacos and the pan chicken with potatoes.  The sliders are yummy too.  Love the on variety of beers on tap.  

I&#39;ve heard people say the food is not good.  I don&#39;t know how far back that impression goes because the food is excellent......especially for a bar.

A nice, different take on the Canadian national dish. (Not officially). Very crisp chips are the base in stead of French fries, steak fries or other potato product. Gravy is rich and beefy flavored, albeit a bit salty. Short rib on top of the gravy and cheese curds finish the dish out. How can you go wrong there? Ya can&#39;t. Sampled the Reuben and Cuban sandwiches. Both were solid reps. No need to expound. 
Now to the bad-Another establishment set on ripping off customers with craft beer. Jimmy&#39;s believes that because they have a decent rotation of craft beer, they can charge up and portion size down. I had a Three Floyds Man-O-Awe. Great beer. It is a pale ale...not an IPA, not an Imperial IPA. A regular pale ale. The beer comes in at a relatively (for craft beer) low ABV-6%. What glass does it come in? A 10oz tulip. Suitable for something 9%+, not for this. I&#39;m not a fan of getting beer-fleeced. So I had 2-10oz.  beers totaling $12 as opposed to the beer being served in a pint (16oz) or an imperial pint glass (20oz) for $7-8, an acceptable price. 

Seeing as I like to have a beer or two with a meal, I have to say there are many better options around Naperville and Whereas I may have gone back for the food, I won&#39;t because of Jimmy&#39;s beer profit agenda."

That came within 5 mins.  However, after that it was as if our table didn&#39;t exist.  Ordered 1 beer and it took 20 mins to get.  Meanwhile 2 tables who sat down 15 mins after us were already eating.  Now we hadn&#39;t even been asked to order yet.  Once we ordered it took another 20 mins for 2 salads, a grilled cheese, &amp; 1 medium burger.  Now I will say the burger was good, but not 12.50 good.  Seems to be that Jimmy&#39;s tried to get trendier and fancy but left out the good service and common sense.  $67 for what we had seems a bit much."

IN MY OPINION...crappy beer selection and the staff sucks. I love bar food, but this bar food is just ok. It is overshadowed by the worst staff on Earth. 

My husband and I went there on a Sunday night for dinner, and the place was NOT busy. So I&#39;m not sure why it took 10 minutes for our server to bring us our drinks, another 10 minutes to take our order, and then 30 minutes for us to get our food. We asked for refills from our server, and two other servers...eventually we had to go up to the bar to get them. RUDE. Plus, everyone else around us got their food first, when they had been seated after us. They were larger families...all my husband and I had ordered were sandwiches with fries, how hard is that?

I am a former server so I sympathize with waitstaff a lot. But I&#39;m not sure why we had to ask 3 servers for refills, only to have none of them follow up. If our server had been busy, I would have been more understanding as well. But the place was not packed, there wasn&#39;t a wait, and more than half the tables were open. You go into a bar like this with low expectations anyway...it&#39;s not a 5 star restaurant, it&#39;s a bar. I get it. But treat your customers with a little respect...that&#39;s just common business knowledge. 

Aside from being a sub-par restaurant with crappy service...they also have one of the worst beer selections in downtown (in my opinion). The only saving grace is their bottle specials ($2 or $3 is nice for a bottle, compared to the rest of the bars in town). But who do I have to sleep with to get a drink? On several occasions, my husband and I both stood at the bar for 15 minutes waiting to be served...as people around us got their drinks and left, other people came up and got drinks within minutes of standing there. We tried to flag them down, hold money out, and get their attention...they would literally look us right in the eye and say &#34;hold on&#34; and go to the person standing beside us. Do they seriously pride themselves on losing customers? I just think waiting 15 minutes for a beer is crazy, especially when other people were waiting only 2-3 minutes all around us. Again, this has happened on multiple occasions. 

If I could give them a -5 stars, I would. I have never disliked a place as much as this one. I actively dissuade people from going here. Slowly but surely, all of my friends are feeling the same way as I do. I would laugh so much if they went out of business. 

Everything stated here is my opinion."

The service is pretty good - we were greeted within moments of hitting the door, and our server Nicole was top-notch at being attentive.

So, why 2 stars?  Simple: the food just isn&#39;t there.  I tried to order the seared Ahi Tuna - nope, we don&#39;t have it.  Bummer.  So, I went for the Argentinian Steak, which looked like a thin cut of rib eye - with more fat and gristle than I would expect for a $19 steak.  My wife ordered their Grilled Salmon, and kind of got it.  She ordered off the entree menu, and got the sandwich menu - salmon burger.

Don&#39;t get me wrong, it was a good burger.  Their onion rings are excellent as well - you can see they were using fresh oil for this one - the rings were golden brown, and tasted really good.

The view is of Washington Street, so you have the usual collection of Napervillians and North Central College students moving about.  Meh, I&#39;ve had better."

Cons: Bad food, poor service

It was my first time back to Jimmy&#39;s Grill since they revamped the sign, decor, and menu.  We had guests in town so we figured we&#39;d take them to some place we could hang outdoors and have a meal.  

First of all, the service was quite poor.  There were several open tables on the patio where we requested to be seated and we still had to wait 15 minutes.  Then the hostess seated another party before us who arrived 10 minutes after we did.  I had to follow-up with the hostess just to get seated.

The only good thing about the food was the presentation.  I ordered a burger and the taste was bland despite the toppings.  After following up with the others in our party, they too said the food was just ok.  To me that&#39;s a problem considering the prices they charge for food.  I&#39;d say it&#39;s over priced and not worth it.  We also ordered a round of beers and they didn&#39;t bring it out until we asked them where our drinks were.

Unfortunately I cannot recommend this place no matter how busy it looks from the outside. Might consider it just to grab a drink on the patio, but that&#39;s about it."

We walked in and service was fast and friendly.  We talked with a knowledgeable waitress about beer selections.  They have some aggressive craft beers for die hards, but we settled on a lemon flavored draft to go with our burgers.  This bar/restaurant has a very casual ambience with tons of tv&#39;s you can watch all the sporting events.  The Kentucky Derby was running that day, and burgers and beers seemed called for.  The seating was great, the waitress knowledgeable, beers delicious, but this had to be one lackluster burger.  I almost thought they had steamed it... Billed as Black Angus, I ordered mine medium rare, which the waitress discouraged since it had a definite blue/red center, so I copped for medium!, with blue cheese and mushrooms.  The shrooms were canned, cold and the burger was disappointing, with no pink in sight.  Had I made a better lunch selection it would have gotten two more stars, but a place like this needs a really good burger with fresh mushrooms...when your mentality says mushrooms from a can work...you become suspect!  I might try it again, but not for burgers, maybe some of the small plates and beer."

She sat down while I went through some beers with no suggestions on what&#39;s available.

My mom, cousin, bff and I stopped here for a few drinks before heading back to the city..and since it was one of the first nice days of the year, it was packed. We were sitting inside the bar area, and while the server wasn&#39;t great, we never expected our experiences taking such a drastic turn towards total crap.

We were finishing our second round of drinks, but my mom was in a hurry, so she left us $40 cash. When we got the bill, it was around $60 dollars, so we put in the two twenties and two cards...well, the server comes back about ten minutes later...and each card is charged for $29 dollars. We waited a good additional fifteen minutes for the server to come back to take the receipts, and when I tried to ask her why the cards were charged for so much when we left cash, she got VERY defensive...

I was adamant that we left cash, and instead of being apologetic, she had the nerve to say &#34;oh hey you are some scary girls&#34;...all because we demanded that check be corrected? A manager finally comes over, of course does not apologize for what happened (or the server&#39;s attitude), cannot show that he voided the transaction, so just hands us $40 in cash to make us go away, I assume. THEN, as we are walking out, another manager comes over, said he voided the charges, ASKS FOR THE CASH BACK....and now of course, two weeks later, the cards were of course charged for the incorrect, full amount.

Maybe she did lose the money, who knows...but somehow I don&#39;t think a server who made an honest mistake would be so quick to jump down our throats...Between her, the terrible attitudes from the managers AND lack of apologies, I will never set foot in Jimmy&#39;s again....and I worked at a very busy bar in the city for two years, so I get stuff happens...but basically own it, and don&#39;t be jerks.

I just wish I had had more than two glasses of wine, so my nerves would have been calmer during the whole debacle."

Everything was fine, nothing earth shattering. However, I know plenty about craft beer and while it&#39;s nice to see some solid draft selections..they are seriously ripping people off by shorting people by 3-4 ounces per beer in almost everything on draft. In general, unless a beer is barre/oakl aged, almost all beers under 7% ABV shoud be a pint not a 12 oz pour..that&#39;s 25% shortfall. 

It&#39;s a shame because the patio is a gold mine..but actually stealing from a customer isn&#39;t cool."

We weren&#39;t happy. We talked to the manager and he was able to get us a booth. Ok, at this point we thought it was going to be alright. The amount of options on the menu was too small.

I came here on the way home from taking my daughter to the children&#39;s musuem, down the street.... Saw the good reviews, but I&#39;d never step foot in this place again.

I ordered a chicken gyro. Average taste, but I was starving. Honey mustard was ok - made the gyro have flavor. Overpriced, forsure. 6.50? 

Ordered chicken nuggets for my 2 y/o (Not the kids meal, 9 nuggets themselves) IT WAS basically eating McDonald nuggets. WTF - I haven&#39;t been to McDonald&#39;s in years. Felt like I just threw $4 out the window for some low grade nuggets.

oh -- and I ordered cheese fries. GOOD THING I CHECKED MY BAG IN THE CAR, because they weren&#39;t even in there. The cheese on the side was - but NOT the fries. 
I had to walk all the way back in with a sleeping toddler in my arms, and I didn&#39;t even receive a &#34;sorry&#34; or any customer service in that regard. AND THEY QUESTIONED ME TWICE IF THE FRIES WERE IN THE BAG. **JUST GIVE ME MY FRIES, and let&#39;s go! I have a sleeping 25 lb baby in my hands for damn sakes**

I ended up paying over $14 for just me and my 2 year old. Didn&#39;t get the service I&#39;d expect, or food. Screw the yelp reviews, I&#39;d much rather go to portillios for $2 less. 

Wish I could have my money back.

They have everything: soups, salads, appetizers, Greek sandwiches, charbroiled burgers, gourmet burgers, all american sandwiches, hot dogs, deluxe sandwiches, dinners, chicken lover options, desserts, specialty sandwiches, a kid&#39;s menu...you get the picture.

I ordered the #3 -- Gyro, french fries and a fountain beverage (Pepsi products). My total came to $9.53. My plate was FULL so it was well worth it. 

The gyro was fantastic and topped with tzatziki sauce, tomatoes, and onions. The pita was stocked with a TON of meat. In order to pick it up properly and eat it as handheld item, I had to take off about half of the meat to fold the pita. Definitely not complaining, just something to note. I saw a couple other people just diving in with a fork and knife and skipping the gyro fold all together. Hey - whatever works! The fries complimented the meal nicely and they were the perfect texture - a little crunch on the outside, but mashed on the inside.

My event was yesterday and I was very disappointed.  Let&#39;s start by saying I was never offered anything in writing on this order or presented with a receipt at the end. I called numerous times to alter the order well in advance and always dealt with the same nice girl on the phone. 
Yesterday the promised delivery for 230pm didn&#39;t happen. I called and was told they would be 20 min late. 45 min later I called and was told 10 min. 20 min later I called and was told it should&#39;ve been there. 10 min after that they arrived. But of course forgot the salad. I called. Someone was bringing it. It got there but my extra pan of potatoes I paid extra for never did. I was done calling. The pork was so dry it was inedible.
 They did credit me some money for the inconvenience but not enough. 
My company uses them for office
 lunches as well but after this we may be rethinking that.
I definitely expected more from Greeks being a Greek myself."

I&#39;ve been wanting to go to Nicky&#39;s for a long time, but sometimes have a really hard time convincing friends for that fare.  Well, my opportunity came to get fat with a friend and we ordered a family gyro meal, a couple of italian beefs, and a slab of ribs.

The ribs had a good texture and a decent sauce, the italian beef was tasty (though a side of sauce to pour / dip would be nice, somehow it soaked through 2 layers of parchment wrap and didn&#39;t ruin the bun), and the Gyros were in pretty good supply.  1lb of gyro meat was not as much as I was visualizing mentally (probably enough for a normal family to have 4 fat gyros though) so if you don&#39;t need the extra sides an a-la-carte order might be wiser.  The coleslaw was really good and the meal came with a huge container of tzatziki as well.  The fries were just fries, but they were good too.

We must have been hungry and finished all but 2 pitas and half of the gyro meat.  Everything was good, and I would definitely go back to get any of the above.  Good job Nicky&#39;s!  I&#39;m excited to try your hot dogs next!"

Nicky&#39;s was a regular lunch spot for me years ago, so I figured to give them a shot for catering my son&#39;s birthday party.  Prices are fair and the quality was very good.  The beef was great, which was apparent given that almost all 5 lbs were consumed quickly.  The mostaccioli was good, though I probably would opt for meat sauce next time.  Garden salad was pretty standard, but I&#39;m glad that they did not skimp on the veggies and the house dressing was delicious.  We added an order of Italian sausage which was great as well.  

In addition, they delivered and the guy set everything up and was courteous.  Would definitely recommend"

It was relatively empty for lunch time but seemed to have quite a few take out and delivery orders.

There is a pretty huge menu with a variety of typical fast food American-styled food to choose from. The menu is quite similar to Portillos (which interesting because there is one literally one block down). The prices are actually pretty reasonable considering that a combo (sandwich, fries, drink) can be bought between $5-7 depending on what you order. 

I decided to try the Italian Beef w/ sweet &amp; hot pepper topped with cheese (adding about $1.50 to my meal). Which ended up being around $10. My friend got a Cheese Burger meal and a Gyro, and only ended up being slightly over $10. 

The Italian beef was alright, the bread that they used was really crispy and good. But the beef itself was slightly lacking. The hot and sweet peppers were pretty good, but I think the beef was missing a bit of juice that I would have liked to see. The fries were my favorite part of the meal, crispy, hot and tasty. 

I tried a bit of my friend&#39;s gyro and the meat was pretty decent, nothing really special though. 

Overall, the food was pretty good but nothing out of the ordinary. The prices were reasonable and the food came out relatively quick. I think this would be a decent place if you just want a quick place to stop in for lunch. They also had interesting chicken offerings which I will probably try next time."

After trying the Italian beef here I have NO idea why people line up around the building at Portillo&#39;s. 

Even the fact that the bottom of the sandwich roll was imploding with juice could not derail my enjoyment. Blanketed with mozzarella cheese, this beat the pants off a standard steak sandwich. 

Despite the fact that it was after-work hours on a Friday night and a lot of people were lined up (most for take-out), the wait was short. They clearly have it down in the kitchen. 

Next time I will take mine to go too. That was the only negative: noise. TVs blaring in every corner, and then as I was finishing a table with four SCREAMING children under the age of 6 barrelled in. See ya!

Ended up paying around 8.50 for a combo. A little pricey in my opinion but I suppose they can do that since it&#39;s something different than the bigger chains.

The burger was tasty and the toppings, lettuce, tomato, onion, were fresh. The patty was a tad on the greasy side and there was a touch too much mustard. The mustard mixed with the grease from the patty made this a very messy burger to eat, but I didn&#39;t mind too much. The bun was good, fluffy, warm. The fries were delicious. Not too salty, and they actually tasted like potatoes! Nice and crisp on the outside but soft and fluffy on the inside. Not too greasy either. Honesty, pretty much among the best fries I&#39;ve ever had. 

The atmosphere is relaxed like you&#39;d expect of a hot dog/burger joint but has a little class to it. Nice paint and pictures on the walls, not too loud, a couple flat screens, and clean. It was comfortable and relaxed. Maybe even a good place for a casual date. Heh.

They loose one star because of the greasiness of the burger that made it difficult to eat, and I feel like the patty could have been more flavorful. Still, it was fresh and satisfying. I am a burger lover and despite my couple of complaints, I&#39;ll eat here again."

I called in my order and went to pick it up. I ordered two gyros that came with fries and a drink. It all totaled about 22 bucks. I have no problem for paying for something that I want. But I should have returned this. Anyone who ever eaten a gyro knows that the meat is moist and the gyro sauce ( I don&#39;t know the proper name for it right now) is suppose to be in abundance and overflowing on top of the sandwich. Sadly that was not the case of these gyros. The Pita bread was dry, the meat was dry, and the sauce was nonexistent. I swear it was like eating cotton balls and trying to swallow them but it gets stuck in your throat so you take a drink of whatever your drinking and you can actually feel the lump being pushed down your throat and hit the bottom of your stomach. Yeah I am clearly not a happy customer because based off of these reviews I expected better but maybe people have no taste buds. I don&#39;t know. but my meal was ridiculous.

Me, on the other hand, didn&#39;t care much my chowder soup. I didn&#39;t care much about the service neither as the man at the counter didn&#39;t help too much with my ordering and tried to rush me as I could not decide between chicken tender or ribs.

Inside is are a handful of tables for seating along with a few outside tables with Vienna Beef umbrella&#39;s. I looked over the menu and decided to try the Hot Dog.


The first thing I noticed was that they offered a regular Hot Dog for 2.55 and a hot dog with fries for a dollar more. Despite not ordering fries, I got them anyway. The hot dog I received came on a non-poppy seed bun. The bun was not particularly soft, but wasn&#39;t hard either. The sausage itself had a nice flavor to it and all the juices appeared to be intact after steaming. It came with a thick pickle, nice chopped up onion, and a sour relish that isn&#39;t the typical neon green style you find at most Hot Dog establishments around Chicagoland. I didn&#39;t detect any presence of celery salt and there was a bit more mustard than there should have been.

The fries were very bland, they were not very salty and the potato paste inside wasn&#39;t very tasty. As far as the texture goes they weren&#39;t too crispy or too soft. While they certainly didn&#39;t taste bad, they didn&#39;t taste that good either, needless to say most of them wound up in the trash.

Overall if you&#39;re looking for a hot dog on Ogden Avenue in Naperville don&#39;t stop at Nicky&#39;s. While some of their other menu items might be better, their hot dogs aren&#39;t anything to brag about and their fries are even less memorable."

I&#39;m used to a cucumber taste. 

First look shows lots of meat, carved from the (thingy), stacked on the pita, with onions and tomatoes, and a huge glob of the sauce on top. The sauce was firmer than I expected - in some places it stood on it&#39;s own on the meat. And the taste? All things being equal, the sauce will either make or break the gyros: I wasn&#39;t thrilled. I like that Gemato&#39;s grills their freshly carved meat first - gives it a little crispness - and their sauce has a nice cucumber taste.  The fries were pretty good.

Dad had the Maxwell polish - he said it was ok. Mom had the chicken noodle soup and large salad, and said it was very good."

Nicky&#39;s has been around for quite awhile. They have upgraded their restaurant and have even added a second location!

Despite the Mediterranean/Greek description Yelp gives it, Nicky&#39;s offers a plethora of great food. 

My recommendations...

-Gyros... One of their specialties. Fresh, flavorful, and affordable. Served in a soft, warm pita. Very delicious. 

-Chicken tender basket... adds about six minutes to the cooking time of your meal but is definitely worth it. Very fresh cuts of white meat chicken in a soft coating. Killer with their honey mustard. 

-Burgers and Hot Dogs are great. No need to go into detail.

-Ribs are flavorful and a nice occasional treat. 

I have not had a bad menu item. Their salads are large, filling, and delicious. They put quality into preparing their food and the price is incredible. Highly recommended."

Lots of choices, from falafel to yep, hot dogs.  

I got the chicken gyros and it was perfectly done, not oily yet not too dry.  I just wish there was hot sauce to compliment it.  They should consider offering up hot sauce bottles at each table. Maybe I&#39;ll bring my Sriracha bottle with me next time!  Also, they should consider putting numbers at the tables and having someone bring over the food.  That&#39;s a better approach than making customers walk back through the take-out crowd to get the food. Despite that, the meat itself was awesome.  I had a bite of the lamb gyros too, equally great.  The lemon-accented greek potatoes make a good side dish to any sandwich.  The salads have great quality ingredients (but so-so dressings). Tiramisu is a packaged version by Eli&#39;s, but tastes very fresh and not too heavy.  Overall, you get enough food for leftovers and it&#39;s worth the bill.  Now if they could just put Halloumi cheese on the menu!

Today, I tried the chicken gyro with a greek salad &amp; fries. What I got was a a deconstructed gyro (literally a bag of meat and a few shards of lettuce) and two greasy bags of fries. Aren&#39;t gyro&#39;s supposed to come with tzatiki sauce - that white yogurt / cucumber sauce? Mine came with this weird sweet, mayo thing.

It is also VERY affordable.  I&#39;m surprised at how cheap the bill is whenever my family goes.

Also, the restaurant is always clean even under the tables.  Love that.

If you go on a Friday (I think?) get the chicken and rice soup.  It&#39;s amazing!  I drive all the way across town to get it for lunch.

There&#39;s only 2 things I don&#39;t like:
There&#39;s no drive-through and everything seems to be made to order so you really have to go in to eat.  That&#39;s one of the only reasons we only eat there one in awhile.

Also, the service reminds me a little of the Seinfeld Soup Nazi.  They are not the nicest people - I guess they don&#39;t have to be??  If you call in your order you get a &#34;What do you want? What&#39;s your name?  When are you picking it up?&#34; and that&#39;s about it."

I came here with my parents, who really like this chain. I did not get anything. So I was able to review their experience:

They always get the Arby&#39;s &#34;Super&#34; sandwich, which may or may not be on the menu. It&#39;s the same as the &#34;roast beef&#34; mid or max, but with lettuce and tomato, no cheese. Apparently from the 80s, so they say.

Stating, &#34;One comes here expecting a meal, and it usually exceeds expectations&#34; , says my father.

Upon looking at their meals, they looked fresh and tasty, or as fresh as you can make freshly sliced roast beef look. 

They finished their meals entirely and they were very pleased.

&#34;This meal is so good, it&#39;s hard for it to be over&#34;, my father.

We decided to hang out for a bit. Hunter, one of the employees, cleared off the table for us. A kind gesture, definitely.

Arby&#39;s

We were in today and the kid taking the order seemed baffled when I requested &#34;a classic roast beef sandwich and a small pop.&#34; After we went around three times I realized that he wasn&#39;t processing the &#34;pop&#34; part of the equation (as in soda, beverage). We live in the Midwest, where this is a typical term -- ?? 

One thing this location desperately needs is to repave the parking lot! There are some bad chuckholes in here, especially when exiting. 

Overall though, Arby&#39;s is different from any other fast food and it&#39;s nice to have one on the Ogden drag."

And as someone who himself is a smoke master, I have to give Arby&#39;s major props for carving out a niche for itself and delivering the meats in fine fashion, considering this is a fast food joint. 

After hearing James Earl Ray yell at me about Arby&#39;s, I had to give the spicy jalepeno (is there any other kind of jalepeno) brisket sandwich a go. And it was damn tasty. Smoky, spicy, lean brisket nestled in a toasted bun. Hard to believe I was at Arby&#39;s. And as a side, I went with the steakhouse onion rings and those too were really fine. 

For you non-meatheads, they have a good looking chicken sandwich and even some salads. 

All in all, a pleasant surprise and mighty tasty."

The inside of the restaurant is a little bit of an 80s time-warp, with a multi-level seating area and a large plantscape in the middle of the dining area, reminiscent of the old Wendy&#39;s dining rooms with the salad bar.

I ordered at the counter.  The cashier, I think his name was Hunter, was super friendly without being overbearing, creepy, or annoying (which is how I usually interpret fast food counter friendliness - like when the guy at McDonald&#39;s called me &#34;angel face.&#34;)  He appeared relaxed and in a good mood, just wanted to chat about the weather.  I later overheard him chatting with co-workers about going to school, etc.  Seems like a pleasant kid to work with.  I kind of wanted to rescue him like a puppy - &#34;RUN FREE, HUNTER!

I usually have no issues with this location but my last experience wasn&#39;t the best. I was very excited to try their BBQ pulled pork sandwich, being in love with anything BBQ I had to try it. When I got to the order board, i didn&#39;t notice a option for it. I asked the person helping me if they had it, and all I got was a very irritated &#34;no&#34;. Uhhhhh ok, so apparently that&#39;s out of the question. I ordered what I thought I&#39;d like, a Chicken sanwich. The line through the drive thru was long, but moving pretty quick. I got closer to the window and realized I had forgot to order apple crisp. So before I handed her (which was the shift manager) my credit card, I asked her if I could add on a apple crisp I forgot, then apologized for my mistake. She shoved, and I mean shoved my drink at me and walked away. If she could have thrown it at me, she would have. I was shocked. She came back, asked what kind of sauce I want, gave me my bag and left. No goodbye, no thank you. I left feeling a little jaded and disrespected. I didn&#39;t go there to be an inconvenience to them, but that&#39;s what I definitely felt like.
My chicken was dry. The ham on the chicken over powered the whole burger and I couldn&#39;t even eat it. They threw about 2 table spoons of cinnamon onto my apple crisp, which I am pretty sure qualifies as taking the &#39;cinnamon challenge&#34;. And to top it all off, that sauce i told her to put in the bag? Non existant. 
I wasn&#39;t too impressed with this visit, and it might actually cause me to look for a different location.

And the curly fries? 

I am old enough to recall what McDonald fries actually tasted like when they were the best in the world. Yes, kiddies, Mcdonald&#39;s fries were the most amazing food product in the world at one tme.

(OK, that was really bad but the food here is really good!).

They have a Pick 3 Children&#39;s Meal option for $5, including drink. My little guy had a whole grilled cheese and finished it. Like finished a w-h-o-l-e  honest-to-goodness sandwich in one setting on a lunch break in a fun, stimulating children&#39;s museum. As a parent of a 2 year old, this is miraculous. If you are a parent of a toddler, it&#39;s like hearing trumpets and hallelulahs. It&#39;s like finding out that you are in the audience of Oprah&#39;s Favorite Things when you are in the daily routine of getting stuck in the Oprah audience with the sad music playing for a downer episode on euthanasia or a special remote-guest-from-prison kind of crap. Are you with me? This was beyond a hit and completely unexpected! If he could talk, I believe he would say that it was his favorite lunch ever. Since he doesn&#39;t talk, we will let his actions of finishing a whole grilled cheese, a pouch of organic fruit snacks (50 cent upcharge), and an organic juice pouch speak for him.
 
The museum did a great job with the menu for kids and adults, even solid veggie options. The adult sandwiches were tasty too and we finished them (no surprise there). Boar&#39;s Head turkey and cheese with Terra chips for 6.50. Yummy peach iced tea."

If you also come here for the service may be a solid 4 stars. If you ask me about cleanliness, forget it. The tables and floors are sticky, including the silverware. I&#39;m just glad I didn&#39;t see the restrooms :-)

The food here though is really the superstar why I liked this place. I&#39;ve been to couple Mexican restaurants that offer a wide variety of specialty seafood fare and Mai Quesi is up there. 

Appetizer: Round tostadas and ceviche, instead of the traditional chips and salsa. All for free. 
Entrees: (1) Huachinangos/Red Snapper cooked Mai Quesi style, so the fish is deep fried to golden crisp, served with chopped salad, fries and a heart warming shrimp soup which could be used as a sauce for the snapper. (2) Molcajete Seafood and Steak. This will remind you of the colorful Mexican Huichol or Wixáritari culture. You&#39;ll get what I mean when the combination of flavors hits your palate coming from the shrimp, white fish, chopped steak, ribs, chorizo, cheese, cactus, and peppers served in a stone bowl. This is also the first time I had to try cactus and it tasted like cooked cucumber. This was a great dining experience for the family while being serenaded by the Mariachi. Our server is also nice and very attentive, she even help explain the dishes we ordered. I was able to use a yelp deal which I paid only $15 for $30 worth of food.

Funny thing is that we were turned off with the ambiance the first time we went here with the kids on a Friday dinner. They&#39;re packed from bar thru the dining area and a DJ was playing loud latino music that we can&#39;t even hear each other when arranging for a seat, so we ended up driving our hungry selves to Denny&#39;s. Best time to enjoy the food here particularly when you have kids in tow is during the weekend lunch so it&#39;s not too crowded. The cocktails look yummy too, would try that next time."

The staff was extremely friendly and attentive. The restaurant it&#39;s self was not super fancy, but it was full of happy people having a good time. It kind of felt like being on vacation. 

We ordered the prawns, the stuffed pineapple and two cocktails. Everything was extremely flavorful and the portions were very generous. Both of the items we ordered were pretty difficult to eat, but it was definitely a fun meal. I will be going back soon!

The only thing was that I found their menu somewhat confusing. There was an English, a Spanish and a bar version. Each menu had she same or similar offerings, but the prices didn&#39;t really match up. I am not really complaining about it because it ended up being much less expensive than I thought it would be, but I do sometimes order food based on how much the item.... it wasn&#39;t a big problem but just something that could be improved."

I have been here for lunch and dinner, during the week and on the weekend, and have had a fairly consistent experience (not all of which is good).  I can&#39;t say that it&#39;s dirty, but it&#39;s never very clean in there, and I&#39;ve had to wipe off parts of the booth and/or table on every visit.  Thankfully, though, they bring you a small serving of a very standard, simple, complimentary ceviche when you sit down, so it all kind of evens out.  The service, which has been friendly every time, has been incredibly slow every time too, which a person can overlook when it&#39;s a new restaurant on a very busy Saturday night, but which is incomprehensible at 1:00 on a Wednesday afternoon and you&#39;re the only table in the restaurant; it shouldn&#39;t take almost two hours to have lunch, but thankfully I didn&#39;t have any time restraints that day.  It&#39;s not far from where I live or from where I work, but I would never have lunch here again unless it&#39;s my day off and I have a solid two hours; in fact, I don&#39;t eat here at all if I have plans for later--I&#39;ve been burned by this place before and I won&#39;t let it happen again.

The food has been pretty good, and though I&#39;m not going to pretend that the seafood is of the highest quality, it&#39;s never been bad or old; however, it&#39;s pretty obvious that some of the items they serve wouldn&#39;t have been fresh for very much longer.  Thankfully, everything has been cooked well, and cooked well consistently;  I truly appreciate a place that cooks octopus well, time after time, in an area where octopus--when offered--is often tough and fishy.  You&#39;ll also find tasty and unique preparations for fish, crab, and lobster that are hard to find even amongst other Mexican restaurants in Aurora, let alone in the surrounding suburbs.  My one and only gripe about the food is something that has also been mentioned in at least one or two other reviews: the shrimp.  I cannot abide shrimp with an intact intestine.  It seems to be the standard way that they serve all their shrimp, which is fine as long as you understand that and don&#39;t mind it.  It may be unfair of me to hold it against them, being that this is how shrimp is served in Mexico and it IS a Mexican restaurant, but I still feel that it is one of those simple adaptations that a business should be able to make because it is appreciated by the locals and because it doesn&#39;t compromise the basic integrity or identity of the business.  In the end, it means that I cannot order things that I would normally order and really enjoy because I don&#39;t feel like eating the half-digested remains of the poor shrimp&#39;s last meal or want to have to remove the intestine myself from each individual shrimp.

As far as price goes, I don&#39;t understand the comments about it being expensive--it&#39;s not.  For what you&#39;re getting, the quality of what you&#39;re getting, and for how much you&#39;re getting, you are being charged a very fair price.  If you think 20 bucks is too much for a meal (regardless of whether it&#39;s steak, lobster, or grilled cheese) just don&#39;t come here, because twenty dollars is on the lower end.  That said, I would say that most of the meals--if not all--could VERY easily be split amongst two people, especially if you&#39;re going to get an appetizer or two.  And now if I could take a moment to recommend a couple of the things that I really enjoyed there:

The Red Snapper (Huachinango); like many of the items on the menu, you choose one of 4 to 6 styles of preparation, which includes how it&#39;s cooked (grilled, steamed, friend, etc.) and flavoring (spicy, garlic, tomato and herb, etc.).  I personally loved it with the garlic and oil, which is great for a fish that can sometimes be on the dryer side.  It came with some pretty average rice and I believe a little salad or something, but the fish is fresh, meaty, tasty, and cooked well every time.

The Seafood Cocktail; for those unfamiliar with shrimp cocktail served Mexican style, it almost looks like someone dumped a bunch of seafood into a bowl of gazpacho--hmm, actually, that&#39;s pretty much what it is.  Raw oysters and scallops, plus cooked shrimp (which, again, I don&#39;t eat), octopus, and shredded crab meat, are dumped in generous amounts into a tasty tomato base that isn&#39;t too watery, too tamato-y, salty, or acidic.  I crave it when enough time passes.

The Stuffed Lobster; unfortunately it&#39;s stuffed with lots of shredded crab and shrimp, which all get pushed to the side of my plate, but I otherwise still thoroughly enjoy the lobster itself, which is flavorful with just a little hint of spice, and is also served with some average rice and some pretty tasty fries.

All in all, I feel bad giving this place only three stars, but I will continue to come here periodically and hope that the rough edges get smoothed over."

We ordered oysters which were fresh and delicious and HUGE. They were pretty big oysters.

The reason why I was so thrilled was because we have recently become obsessed with a Mexican Seafood place in the city.  I can&#39;t remember the name, but I have reviewed it if you want to take a look.  It is the real deal - the most authentic and delicious food in this category that you will find.  Anyway, we have become obsessed.  To the point where even though it is probably around an hour drive with traffic and &#34;special occasion&#34; expensive, we find ourselves there every other week.

I was hopeful that I had found a suburban work-around and that I wouldn&#39;t have to find myself driving to the city next week to satisfy my craving for prawns.  We arrived there and the restaurant itself looks pretty 1-star from its appearance.  It is a hole in the wall kind of place next to a used car dealership.  Both the inside and outside of the place is pretty lackluster in appearance.  And to be honest, I didn&#39;t get an overwhelming feeling that this was a clean place.  I did note the sewer gas smell in the restaurant that another Yelper mentioned in their review and it kind of grossed me out.  

Nonetheless, we proceeded and ordered a standard meal that we normal order in the city to compare.  First change is that they serve alcohol whereas the other place is BYOB.  The drinks were good and inexpensive.  I wanted to order a mojito, but my waitress suggested the Mai Quesi which was similar to a mojito but cheaper.  It also has a chili pepper crusted rim which is oddly awesome.  They give you a ceviche with some tostadas for an appetizer which was great.  Then we ordered a tray of prawns and a shrimp soup to share.  The food was good.  If I hadn&#39;t had the stuff in the city, I might even call it great.  The soup I felt was lacking a little flavor, but I suppose I could have tried adding some hot sauce to give it a kick.  The prawns were pretty good but the sauce was spicier than I am used to.  I think it had more pepper.  The price was also cheaper that what we are used to.  In the city they charge a market price for the prawns, where here it is a set price.  

If you are looking for a suburban alternative, this is a pretty good one.  I think I still prefer the food in the city to this, but it may just save me a couple of trips to the city when I am feeling like prawns."

The staff was friendly though and retook my order and even delivered it to me at work since I used most of my lunch break already. Food was okay I got the steak fajitas and they were pretty good as far as quality/ taste but the portioning was just a little off as their was probably three times as much peppers as steak. Worth it with the deal but probably wouldn&#39;t get it at normal price.

Here&#39;s all the good things about this place 
Great atmosphere your seated almost immediately when you arrive 
Let&#39;s me tell you why the experience went to one star only so we got seated in a boot per request that was dirty so we asked the employee if it could be cleaned it took her 5 min to come back with a wet towel to clean it so now I&#39;m seating in a soaked table that I had to dry myself I ordered my drinks to have to wait 15 min to receive them then another 15 for her to come  and take my order I had to wait 30 min to receive my cocktail shrimp and two ceviche tostadas.
The biggest killer for me not going back is this my cocktail that I ordered was supposed to be a small and it was pretty accurate in size when I received my bill the cocktail was 17.78 even though the small was only 10.00 and large 14.00 so I had to wait for our waitress to come back another 15 min and keep in mind theirs only 5 families in the entire restaurant I asked her about the pricing and I explained that it was a small that I had ordered she said no it&#39;s a large so I said fine honestly really not worth arguing about but then I examined the menu and asked her that even if it was a large it should&#39;ve been only 14.00 on such she took the receipt and she examined it saying it was correct. I also explained to her that adding everything in my tab my subtotal should had been only 45.00 and it was 51.15 I asked her why that was no explanation she left with my bill and didn&#39;t come back for another 10 min and after examine my bill they gave me an employee discount of 3.00 off and my subtotal still did not add up correctly at this point I just paid for it. I noticed the manager walking to each table and never walked towards ours knowing that we had an issue with our bill very unprofessional I approached him introduced myself by my name and told him the situation he said he was going to look into it again!? No thank you I left will never come back even with a deal I hope that their not scamming other people on their bills because they are not checking them."

Our waitress knew a lot about the menu. We decided to order the parrillada Mai Quesi because we wanted a little bit of everything. Everyone apart from me ordered a horchata which to our knowledge did not know they were not free refills and we ended up paying like $50 on just horchatas. When we ordered the parrillada the waitress came back and said they were out of Lobster!!?? How are you out of lobster in a seafood any way. We had to substitute it for something else. I ordered the michelada botanera which was a little too watery not sure if it was too much ice or the mixture they used. When the parrillada came out it was huge! I tasted everything on the platter and everything was really delicious!!! Overall the food was really good the waitress was okay. Prices are pretty high but I guess that&#39;s how all Mexican seafood places are.

     When I walked in, I was instantly hit by a very foul smell of seafood which made me suspicious of how the food was handled. The place does NOT have a fancy atmosphere and rather more of the neighborhood place. It&#39;s not the best looking around, but it does have a strange Mexican vibe. 
     The waitress lacked knowledge of the menu and was assisted by who seemed to be the manager or another waiter. It wasn&#39;t a big deal, but it took much time to take our orders. To note, a few things we tried to order were out even the simplest things like fries and even things they&#39;re known for like seafood. 
     The waitress brought us something to eat as we waited and composed of hard shell tortillas and what I believed was ceviche to dip. We weren&#39;t sure what it exactly was and it was very watery and not very tasty.
     I ordered the Burrita Marinera. When it arrived, it came in a lovely manner. It was sliced in half and given to me in a nice presentation. There was some sauce that was spread around but not touching the burrito and it came with another sauce in a small metal cup. I happened to try the sauce in the cup first before eating it with the burrito. At first it tasted strangely like Apple sauce and it was slightly spicy. It gave me a mangoneada element which I found unpleasant to my taste. I had forgotten to ask what the sauce was called unfortunately. In the end, I enjoyed the burrito without the sauce. The burrito was quite filling. It was really tasty and it had a lot of seafood in it. I wish I would&#39;ve known what else was in the burrito, but I was satisfied. I had also ordered an Horchata which was refreshing and good but nothing too special. 
     After leaving the restaurant, I learned that the server at our table was rather a bartender helping out even though the restaurant itself was not busy. I was not really bothered by it, but they did have a help wanted sign for a server. 
     After my experience, I would only return if the restaurant was improved in management (food and service) and visuals because it was the most pleasant sight. In addition, many of the dishes were overpriced like a fancy restaurant. Most likely not returning. I would suggest Mexican restaurants around the Schaumburg or Hoffman Estates area instead."

I didn&#39;t want it to go to waste so my friend helped me eat it. I can&#39;t help but feel little rocks in my molars as I chewed.  I went on a Saturday night and I gave it a couple stars because the dj/ karaoke host did a great job with the Spanish karaoke. Otherwise it&#39;s a fishy place for seafood plus the service was extremely slow.

Service was AWESOME. Attentive, kind, always filled my coffee :-)
Bacon Waffle was good, but not blow your mind amazing like you would expect when something has the word bacon in it. Probably should have ordered something more &#34;exotic&#34; but I don&#39;t like sweet stuff for breakfast (it&#39;s okay you can judge me).
I made it a combo with egg whites and bacon. Both were done PERFECT. Seriously perfect. 
I just had higher expectations of the waffle, but all else was very well done.
Did I say they have FLAVORED creamer? Yeah. Bonus points.

Would definitely go back and try other things on their menu. Their benedicts looked awesome, but I couldn&#39;t help but eat a waffle at a place with waffle in their name :-)

If you&#39;re on 55 and have a hankering for breakfast food, definitely get off at Weber Road and give this place a shot. Tell me what you ordered so I can try again :-)"

My hubby got the same thing without mentioning easy cheese and there was too much in the omelette for his taste. But the fruit, unlike so many places, didn&#39;t taste of &#34;refrigerator&#34;, but was fresh and ripe. I got pancakes and hubby got toast so we could share, but the pancakes are not scintillating.

The moment you walk into the restaurant you will notice the open space, high ceilings, simple art decor, and delicious sweet smells of waffles.  My visit was on a Wednesday, right at noon. Walked in the door and was immediately greeted by the host and directed to a booth(speedy service!). Due to a weekday, I am presuming that it doesn&#39;t get slammed like most places in urban areas. Sat down and was promptly greeted by the server, asking us how we were today and that she would be back to check on us. 

The menu is pretty comprehensive. I liked how it&#39;s indexed so that you don&#39;t have an entire novel of a book. The menu is also laminated and clean. I&#39;ve gone to places that hand you dirty sticky menus. This  menu was clean.

We had studied their menu online before showing up, so we were ready to order when the server came back to take our drink orders. Please note that the prices on the menu they have on their website is dated. The two things we ordered were off by $0.20 difference between the online menu and the actual menu.

Chicken and Waffles: You get a delicious golden waffle cooked to perfection... crispy edges, soft chewy insides. The butter, maple syrup, and honey mustard is brought out on the side, in case you&#39;re health conscious. The waffle comes with 3 lightly battered chicken strips that has the perfect salty, crispy/crunchy, juicy/tender combination. It is deep fried, but it doesn&#39;t leave you feeling greasy. 

Chicken Fried Chicken: You get your choice of a side of hash browns, grits, or fruit. In addition, you also get your choice of pancakes or toast. I went with fruit ( freshly SLICED cantaloupe, honey dew, pineapple &amp; watermelon)  and white toast with butter. The chicken fried chicken is delicately breaded, then deep fried to it&#39;s golden honey color. A good heaping of their house made sausage gravy is plopped on.  I had expected the chicken strip and CFC to have the same breading/seasoning, but was pleasantly surprised that they are worlds apart and delicious in their own unique ways.

Overall, the food was delicious, the portions are large. We had to box leftovers to take home. The service was fast and friendly. The establishment is clean, large, and decorated tastefully. There is a nice big parking lot in front. The reason I gave a 4 instead of a 5 star is because of one little nuance like asking for extra gravy was an additional $0.75 charge, which was not listed on the menu."

We were greeted and seated immediately, and the waitress arrived in short order.  Melinda was the server, and she did an outstanding job throughout our meal.  She was friendly and attentive without being intrusive, and promptly took care of all of our requests.

My husband had the blueberry waffle, with fresh blueberries.  The waffle was quite good, cooked to perfection, and the blueberries were nice and plump.  5 stars!  I had a spinach and feta omelet with pancakes and homefries.  The omelet and pancakes were excellent and score some bonus points for heated maple syrup!  The home fries were just OK; I thought they were a bit soggy, and not quite warm enough.  In retrospect, I should have mentioned it, and I&#39;m sure they would have let me try something else.  

In spite of the home fries (which is a very subjective opinion anyway), I am comfortable giving them 5 stars.  Overall, Tasty Waffle is everything we were looking for in a breakfast place.  Clean restaurant, good service, excellent food, reasonable prices.  We will return!"

My son had chocolate chip pancakes and he said they didn&#39;t have any flavor, my daughter had biscuits and gravy and she said they tasted &#34;funny&#34;, my mom had a waffle that she said was tough. My sister,however, had eggs and hash browns and she said they were very good especially the hash browns with peppers and onions. The service was very friendly and the price was reasonable but when 4 out of 5 people don&#39;t enjoy the food, I&#39;m not returning. Too bad because the atmosphere was very cute."

I had done a recent update on my iPhone so the map wasn&#39;t working right and sent us way too far north out of the way, but since everything sounded so good, we spent some extra time on the road looking for it. 

I&#39;m so glad we did!  We had the sweetest waitress!  A pregnant woman who was hustling the whole time. And the food was pretty good. 

Actually the beef barley soup was to die for!!!  I shared some with my sissy, but I enjoyed every bite!  My French dip sandwich was pretty good too. And I skipped the fries. Don&#39;t feel too bad for me since I swapped them out for a side of hash browns with spices, onions and peppers. 

The prices were reasonable and the restaurant is clean. And that soup....I&#39;d make the trip just for that soup"

Service is great, prices are reasonable, and food is very good.  My favorite is the Turkey Club, and based on the number of people ordering this item it seems like the favorite of many folks.  The owner, Ted is a great guy and makes sure the wait staff is on top of things.  One of the best run eateries I&#39;ve ever been at.  I&#39;ve been coming here since 2009 when I moved into the area and I&#39;ve never been disappointed."

My sister&#39;s iPhone update messed up her maps, so after a lovely scenic tour of the area, we finally found this restaurant which is SOUTH OF I-55, just so you know. 

It&#39;s located in a small strip mall and is just a cute place. At first glance, I noticed the restaurant is clean and pretty busy for a Friday morning. They have their specials up on a board in the lobby area which is not listed in the menu, so make sure you take a look at the specials on the board. 

Stephanie was our server and she was excellent. She was pregnant and obviously works hard for her family. 

The menu is quite long. Many options for breakfast and lunch! Typically, my sister would be the one to order breakfast and I would order lunch but on this particular occasion, we switched it up. I think it was the beef barley soup that sold her on lunch. That, and I really wanted breakfast but also wanted to taste the soup, so she chose lunch so I could taste the soup. What a great sister I have! 

The breakfast was yummy. Nothing really great or memorable about it except I really enjoyed their pancakes. I not typically a big fan of anyone&#39;s pancakes except my mother&#39;s but that day, I ate more of my pancakes than I think I have ever before in any restaurant. My sister got a French dip sandwich and changed the fries to their seasoned breakfast potatoes and beef barley soup. The soup was...well, lets just say, I would drive all the way back here from Schaumburg for that soup alone! It was wonderful and that&#39;s an understatement. She seemed pleased with her sandwich of choice and the potatoes, while she liked them, they didn&#39;t do much for me. 

The pricing is perfectly acceptable. The staff was friendly. My only complaint about service was that we sat with dirty dishes on our table for the entire length of our visit. I would have liked to have seen the dishes cleared before the check was presented or at least before we left but this did not happen. 

I will be back. I don&#39;t know when because I practically am never in the area, but it&#39;s on my list to visit again next time I&#39;m down that way!"

The food is good, the portions are amazing and the prices even better. I just only wish they were a little more centrally located than they are. They are tucked away on the far end of Weber road. Typically I wouldn&#39;t go past the Walmart. The &#34;home fries&#34; are delish. I love that they have that southern flair going on. They cook the hashbrowns aka home fries with onions and bell peppers. Yum! And when you ask for cheese in your eggs, you get cheese in your eggs! Most places the cheese is barely visible. I have been to this place two days in a row and will probably go back tomorrow. They stay open later than most brunch places but I wish they stayed open at least until 6pm. 

The waffles would be better considering they have waffle in their name. The waffles are lighter not hearty. Here I can eat the waffle and my meal. Most places I could only eat half of the waffle. The flavor is pretty light. Not too far off in flavor from Eggo waffles except thicker. Definitely will keep coming here as long as they keep their prices low and their portions big. This and their home fries is what sets them apart from other brunch places in the area."

Every time we go, we try a different waffle, pancake, or French toast, and we are never disappointed. The breakfast food here is just delicious. But go for breakfast before 9am on weekends or on a weekday; unless you&#39;re okay with waiting to get a table. The service is pretty good, but nothing to write home about. I give it 5 stars because we&#39;ve eaten here at least 10 times in the past 9 months and we&#39;re always happy with the cost, portion, and taste of the food.

Portions are more than adequate; I always leave with some form of leftovers. Go ahead and bring the whole family-the place is kid friendly without being overrun with noise.

We usually go to tasty waffle and have a positive experience. But today they offered free waffles and I guess the, hostess, waitress and the staff was not prepared for the influx of customers. They were annoyed , And hissed when customers continued to come in. By the way, the free waffles were cold and not fresh. So not only  did I get a, bad hostess and mean waitress I also got a bad waffle. They should not advertise free waffles if bad customer service is a side dish."

I had a Mexican breakfast burrito with jalepenos that was excellent with just the right amount of zest and spice without the jalepenos drowning out the flavor.  My wife&#39;s omelet also received very high marks from my wife who found the pancakes to be the perfect balance of taste and texture.

Then when we said we didn&#39;t want the included pancake/toast option and would just take a side order of a waffle she got grouchy because we insisted she not bring the item we did not want.

Had a late brunch here. The hostess was very friendly when we went in, but I found it a little odd when she asked if there were any children in our dining party. Perhaps they purposely put all the guests with kids on one side of the room? 

We were seated promptly, and our server came by and asked what we&#39;d like to drink. The menu here is crazy big. There were at least a dozen pages, maybe more and each of them crammed full of options. Usually I know what I want within five minutes, but the size of the menu meant we needed more that just five minutes to decide! It&#39;s nice to have choices, but I actually found it more of a negative to have so many options to sort through.  I wound up going with the bacon waffle. My husband had the club sandwich with waffle fries.

There were only two other parties dining when we got there, so our order came out relatively promptly considering there were six of us. My waffle was delicious, a delightful combination of sweet and savory. I&#39;m the kind of person who loves the salty/sweet combination, so whether it&#39;s bacon waffles, fleur de sel ice cream or yoghurt dipped pretzels, there&#39;s a 99.9% chance I&#39;m going to dig it. My husband wasn&#39;t too crazy about his club sandwich - his main issue was the ham. It wasn&#39;t the greatest quality, and made the sandwich &#34;just okay&#34;. According to him, had they used a better cut of ham it would have made the sandwich a lot more enjoyable. This is the kind of thing I would term a &#34;stupid shortcut&#34;. Some businesses use cheaper ingredients so their overall profit is bigger, but it means that customers are getting a substandard product. I&#39;m happy to pay more for better ingredients and walk away feeling satisfied I&#39;ve gotten a good meal rather than pay less and receive a sub-par item. 

While our server was prompt, she was weirdly inconsistent. She brought me a soda refill before I&#39;d finished my first drink, but my husband had to ask her twice to get him a refill. She&#39;d clear away some of our used plates but leave others on the table. It wasn&#39;t a big deal, it was just weird especially since they weren&#39;t that busy. All in all, I probably wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to come back here again. The bacon waffle was tasty and a neat idea, but the fact this place is so far away, combined with all the inconsistencies about this place would encourage me to look elsewhere. 

TL;dr: Solid breakfast food, lunch items need work. Technically nothing wrong with the place, but inconsistency in quality &amp; service means I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to return."

Service was good.  
I ordered the plain waffle combo consisting of a waffle, eggs w/cheese, and 3 sausage link.  And it all tasted just plain. With Waffle in the name I was expecting to taste a waffle that I would want to come back for.  Not!
SInce this is a really simple meal there really isn&#39;t too much to make it an outstanding dish.  However, the price was way too expensive.  $10.00 is too much for such a simple meal."

I appreciated the fact that the tasty waffle uses REAL eggs. I hate it when restaurants use powdered mash potatoes,  egg  mix from a carton, and pre cooked bacon, but yet charge higher prices! If I want cheap nasty breakfast I will go to McDonalds and save my money!!
Anyhow I ordered my steak medium and it was perfect. That steak tasted so GOOD with my sunny side up eggs!! The pancakes were good also!  They didn&#39;t need to be coated with butter or syrup.

My friend that recommended this place had her favorite carrot cake waffle, and she was happy as can be!  The other 2 both had omelets with hash browns which were huge and loaded with veggies.  They looked wonderful!

This place is in a strip mall, but there is tons of room!  Many tables and large groups can be accommodated.  It was busy at 10am, but there was also no wait.

Being from just outside Dallas, I wasn&#39;t expecting to be impressed by food in Crest Hill, Romeoville, or any of the other small neighboring towns (that I might add are wonderfully refreshing in contrast to the hustle and bustle of Big D).  

If I had a gem like this place within 5 miles of my house, I&#39;d need to renew my gym membership.  I ordered the banana nut waffles, which were outstanding.  The waffle itself had wonderful flavor, and there was no shortage of pecans sprinkled throughout.  With some banana slices on top and a hefty dollop of whipped cream, there&#39;s not much room for improvement.  Add a side of two perfectly scrambled eggs (not runny, but not overdone), and dare I say I&#39;m a bit impressed.

The depth of the menu is surprising.  Everything from pancakes, waffles, and French toast to benedicts, scrambles, and even a sprinkling of healthy fare.  My local friend swears by the Florentine benedict, which says a lot for a place with &#34;waffle&#34; right in the name... I&#39;d expected the waffles to be great and everything else to be just average, but turns out they have more than just good waffles!

Lots of waffle, pancake and egg options.  It has just about everything you could want actually, and all very reasonably priced.  Avoid the spinach unless you like frozen spinach in your waffles which then makes it very watery.  

Solid, but not what I&#39;d call high quality or particularly creative.  Coffee is weak but drinkable, nice bonus that they put flavored creamers on the table to perk up the coffee.  Maybe I am just spoiled by all the fabcy brunch places in my neighborhood.  

Get there early or late (based on normal time for the meal you&#39;re aiming for) unless you want to have a long wait.

This is our go-to place for breakfast and lunch, and luckily it&#39;s 5 minutes from our house.
Word of caution - DO NOT attempt to eat here on Sunday mornings after 9:00 am or you will be waiting with hordes of other people, many with 2 or 3 generations in tow. They are efficient and do you seated as quickly as possible, but the wait can be long.
That said, try any other day. It&#39;s busy, but rarely have we had to wait. The place is quite large and has booths around the whole room which are more comfortable than the tables that are rather packed in.
You can&#39;t miss with the waffles here obviously. They have many varieties, served with fruit, mounds of whipped cream (ask for it on the side to preserve your crispy waffle), nuts,, etc. They run daily specials and if you are lucky enough to be there when they have the chocolate waffle with white chocolate sauce and raspberries, order it....so divine...more like dessert. Waffles can also be made with whole wheat floor. Hubby likes their mounding breakfast skillets filled with eggs and all kinds of meat options, plus hash browns. Omelets are huge too and another good choice for egg lovers. The gyros skillet is well done, reflecting the Greek heritage of the owners. French toast and crepe options are way above average too. Portion sizes are extremely generous here and the service is very efficient and friendly. They keep the coffee coming.
They also have an extensive lunch menu of salads, wraps, sandwiches and feature two homemade soups each day. The cream of mushroom(well really any soup with the cream base) is scrumptious. Most lunches come with a large bowl of soup! Be sure to opt for the waffle fries which are nicely seasoned and crispy. Overall, a great place if you live in the area, are visiting Lewis University which is close by or just happen to get lost in the sw burbs!"

My family and I have eaten here over a period of 4 years at least 3x a month. Today&#39;s Mother&#39;s Day breakfast was lousy on many, many levels. We got there before it got busy -- plenty of empty tables at 8am. Service started out promising but then deteriorated. We asked our server for 2 different kinds of hot sauce, which she promised to bring on 3 separate occasions and never did bring any. Had to wait for butter, syrup and coffee. We had to flag down various servers for coffee refills because our server would disappear for long periods of time. During the time that we waited 20 minutes for our check, people from the waiting area could have been seated and creating income for the jerk of an owner. When I went to pay our bill, the cashier took it and placed it off to the side while she took a lengthy carry out order from someone from the waiting area. After standing there for 2 minutes while the owner stood next to the cashier surveying his dominion, I decided that I had PLENTY OF TIME to use the ladies room. When I came back to the cashier, I asked her if she was now ready to take my money. She said yes &amp; when I started to explain about the lack of service today, the owner interrupted me by saying in a thick Greek accent &#34;Happy Mother&#39;s Day. Now you pay. Good-bye.&#34;  Well, good-bye to you and your attitude. I have plenty of other good quality restaurants to choose from in my area. Your place just happened to be on the way to visit our mother&#39;s grave for Mother&#39;s Day. If the owner had taken the time to listen to me about today&#39;s service, I would have gone back after awhile.  In fact I wrote that on the back of the bill. Now I am NEVER GOING BACK because this guy is great at taking your money but not good at managing a business. GO TO George&#39;s, Blueberry Hill Cafe or anywhere they have better food, service and appreciate customer feedback without giving you a nasty attitude."

I can&#39;t give this place much for atmosphere. It is a very open place with high ceilings that almost reminds me of a warehouse. The décor is at a minimum also. Our server was friendly and she did a good job of taking care of us. 

The menu here is quite extensive. They seem to focus mainly on griddle items: pancakes, crepes, blintzes, waffles, etc... I decided on some basic eggs and gyro meat. Everything was outstanding!

So we have a good handle on quality and pricing. This on came across our searches and while further than most, sounded like a good possibility. We like to go early, before the churches let out, so we arrived before seven.

The restaurant was in a strip mall, which is part of a new trend in food places. The building was pleasant, plenty of tables, and wheelchair accessible. There was no wait and we were seated immediately. (no surprise) the staff was helpful, cheerful and made sure we we had refills several times. As noted in other reviews, the have a bunch of flavored creamers as well as standard and our coffee was surprisingly good. I guess I&#39;m not the Starbucks heavy roast kind of guy, so I enjoyed it. There was water at the table too.
 
I ordered a gyros omelet and substituted for the feta cheese, got the home fries, which should be called potatoes O&#39;Brien as the had green peppers, shredded potatoes and spices. Yummy. My wife got a skillet with a blueberry blintz instead of pancakes. (for a small charge) She&#39;s on a blintz chase trying to find the best one in the area.  There was plenty of good food, we both took home a box of leftovers.

Notes: They serve lunch all day long. They are open until 4pm, which isn&#39;t bad for a non dinner restaurant. They have a menu online and offered a little printed menu at the door. The prices were very good for the portions."

The Pizza-Biancos are quality, as are their more spicy selections of personal pizzas. 

The service is lackluster, and given that it is downtown Naperville on a Saturday night, the place became closer to a bar than it did a pizza parlor, disrupting conversations amongst ourselves by the sheer volume of nearby conversations.

But besides the wine, they some craft beers, some on tap, some in cans and bottles. The staff were pretty cool, talking with me on this slow night.

They were terrible... they taste like cough medicine. The waitress said she heard that often and got us new drinks. The sangria had the same terrible taste.

They have a few seating areas with couches and a nice table with a candle, great for us introverts who love to go out but want that intimate, comfortable, feel.

I&#39;ve only been here during the evening when the lights are dim and and the music is low. Perfect for conversation!

We often have appetisers and drinks and I love the appetiser menu! You&#39;re able to pick 4, 6, 8, or 12 items and then choose which ones you would like. They have a great selection of meats, cheeses, and olives, mushrooms, and artichoke to choose from. We recently ordered the bruschetta (I ordered the portobello) and it was amazing! With an order of bruschetta, you get three pieces and you can choose three different types if you like.

The wine selection is great. We usually get a couple bottles for the table and end with a martini (the tiramisu martini is yummy!) for dessert.

The service is prompt and the servers and hosts are lovely! 10/10!"

I came with two friends on a Friday night, and tried to make a reservation. They encouraged me not to, saying it wouldn&#39;t be needed on a Friday night. This was a little concerning to me, but turned out to be correct- the place was maybe 40% full at 730pm.  I don&#39;t know what that says about the business, but it worked out great for us! 

Service remained consistent throughout. Our waitress was helpful in making suggestions on wine (because they have MANY styles we&#39;d never heard of!!) and pizza styles, which we appreciated. We started with the bruschetta trio ($10), ordering the portobello, the roasted pepper and the eggplant marinara. They came to us cut in half already... this did not work well for a group of 3! We had to try to cut them more so we could have equal tastes, and generally made a big mess. Of the 3, we all agreed the portobello was the best. Great flavor and ample mushroom on it. The eggplant was a little too saucy- like if you&#39;d wiped up your left over spaghetti sauce on a piece of bread. The roasted red pepper was decent, but the flavor could&#39;ve used a little bit more of a kick, IMO.

We also ordered two pizzas- the prosciutto with arugula and the spicy pepperoni. Both were great in taste, but a little floppy overall, and when cutting with a knife I couldn&#39;t discern if I was eating pizza dough or cheese at first. Between the 3 of us, we were able to take the two pizzas down, although with a bit of a struggle at the end. 

I enjoyed my experience here and would definitely be willing to come back! I agree with the others, that the decor, colors, and lighting make you feel like you&#39;re in Chicago, not Naperville."

This place has a city vibe and I like it. I like it a lot. The hubs and I decided to hop in the car after work (which is about 8 pm for him) on a Tuesday night (cuz hubby had off the next day) for an impromptu date night. I for once didn&#39;t have a specific taste for something and neither did he. The only criteria on the agenda: WINE.

We parked in one of the parking garages downtown Nape in hopes of just finding a place to pop into. We literally walked out of the parking garage door and there was Neo! Neither of us had been so it was a winning find.

The inside has such a great ambiance. It reminded us of our fave local spot on the city Frasca - complete with city-esque prices. However, we ended up not eating so for all we know it&#39;s totally worth it. The pizza did look and smell amaze!

The bartender was super awesome and although we originally came for wine, she talked us into trying a local beer we never had (ok it didn&#39;t take any convincing at all...sold).

We tried a couple Ten Ninety brews which were awesome! I highly suggest the Wit or Half Wit (dependent on how buzzed you&#39;re lookin to get of course). That Wit is an 11%er I believe. Look out!

I have heard of Ten Ninety before, but never seem it on tap anywhere locally so it was a pleasant surprise! So much so that we&#39;re planning to attend a tasting of their beer at Neo in January!

All in all, this place is the bomb. We will for sure be back to dive into their menu full of bruschetta, antipasti, salad and of course pizza!"

The pizza is good - As a transplant from California, I just don&#39;t have a taste for Chicago style pizza. Neo uses fresh mozzarella, the crusts are fresh and the sauce isn&#39;t too sweet.

Cons:
The lighting is too dark.

It is set up more like a bar than a pizzeria, so if you&#39;re going with kids, expect the wait staff to take a while. (I don&#39;t blame them. They go to where the tips are and a table with 2 cocktails a head + food is always going to generate more than a family with little kids)"

As we walked up to the entrance, I felt myself swoon.  Is that EDM (okay, we&#39;ll call it EDM &#34;light&#34;) pulsating through the speakers?  

Stepping inside, you kind of forget you&#39;re in downtown Naperville.  I&#39;m not completely anti-Naperville, but nudging elbows with Naper moms and dads just isn&#39;t my scene.  Neo is like another world.  The walls are painted a charcoal gray, the decor also has a cold, dark, industrial feel.  The clientele, at least on this particular Saturday night, was heavily female; and of course a few couples and even a family dining with children.  

Although I fell in love with the atmosphere, I have to be honest:  I liked the pizza at Fiamme better.

But, let&#39;s rewind.  I started with a prosecco cocktail, which had a candied cherry at the bottom of the glass.  It was a good start to a celebratory birthday dinner with some friends.  There are a few signature cocktails, a minimalist beer list, but a solid wine list.  Bringing your own wine?  $15 corkage fee.  That&#39;s laughable.  Why even allow patrons to bring wine at all?

We shared the Neo salad, portioned well for 2-3 people.  The salad was pretty disappointing, as it was 90% lettuce doused in balsamic vinegar.  The salad was lacking in all of the other ingredients that were supposed to be in it.

Because we&#39;re indecisive, and we were hungry, we ordered two pizzas to share:  the Margherita and the Quattro Meat.  Both pizzas were good, but the Quattro suffered the same disappointment as the salad, as there was a complete lack of ingredients.  I ate two slices of this pizza and missed out on at least two of the meats that were supposed to be on this pizza.  The margherita was good, would have went nicely with a glass of wine.  But both pizzas also were a bit too soggy in the middle.

Service was OK, but he seemed a little too distracted to be attentive.

I&#39;m really on the fence.  3 stars or 4?  Given the ambience and &#34;escape from Naperville,&#34; I might say it warrants a 4, but the food was more of a 3 for me.  I&#39;d really like to come back and give it another shot though."
pizzeria-neo-naperville-2,James S.,kEx7lJUYv0pFnCWP0Vj0hA,"Aurora, IL",0,1,0,0,34,xY7YsGpN3af6jxEeZRBljQ,2.0,2015-09-27,"Ate here on a Saturday night with my brother who was staying in Naperville for the evening. He had a taste for pizza so I suggested NEO as I had read good things about it on Yelp. Upon entering we were greeted promptly and although downtown Naperville was bustling as usual that September night, we were pleased that there was no wait for a table. The place was about 3/4 full. 

During our meal our server was just as friendly and attentive as the hostess at the door had been. One criticism though, she never mentioned any specials (do they have specials?) or the &#34;pasta of the day&#34; as mentioned on the menu. Perhaps she was new? No problem though, we were there for the pizza.

For those not familiar with the place, they serve thin-crust pizzas that are quickly baked in their wood-fired brick oven. The menu also lists pasta dishes and a nice selection of appetizers, including an interesting selection of brushcetta. Prices are about what you&#39;d expect for downtown Naperville.

Pizzas are divided into those made with red sauce versus &#34;white&#34; (no sauce). We each ordered a pizza. I had one of the white pizzas (I think it was called Salsicia) with sausage and carmelized onions. My brother ordered the olive pizza from the &#34;red&#34; side of the pizza menu. It also included thin quarter-sized slices of a flavorful, if a bit chewy, salami. I also had a Caesar salad as well as a Domaine Du Page from Two Brothers (poured from the bottle). My brother order a glass of their house red. 

My Caesar Salad consisted of a good sized portion of cold, crisp, chopped Romaine and lots of shaved Parmesan. It was served with four wedges of grilled bread. I appreciated that the salad was lightly dressed and not swimming in dressing. Unfortunately, the dressing itself was thin and lacking in the assertive Caesar flavor I was anticipating. A pretty wimpy interpretation of the classic if you ask me.

The pizzas were okay, not great. The quality of ingredients was apparent; however my primary criticism is the dough was a little more than chewy. I expect a nice chew from an artisan thin-crust like this, but this crust was a little too much so, especially the outer crust. Upon examining the leftovers at home in better light, I detected a thin &#34;gum line&#34; in the crust suggesting that maybe the problem was the pizza could have baked for another minute or so. Of course, maybe there&#39;s another reason for the toughness? All I know is I&#39;ve had better thin-crust artisan-style pizza. Also, on my pizza there were hardly any of the advertised carmelized onions. The onions that were there provided a nice counterpoint to the sausage, so the overall lack of onion was disappointing.

Regarding the wine, my brother and I were both surprised by the paltry serving size. At $8 for a glass of house wine we both felt that they should provide a more generous pour. Also, they bring the wine to table in a carafe so teensy it would be comical if it wasn&#39;t such a rip-off. (IMHO, the table-side pouring of the wine from carafe to glass is also a totally unnecessary affectation. Let&#39;s face it, it&#39;s really just a sneaky way to consistently portion the wine in the tiny serving size.) 

With some slight tweaks this place could be top notch, but with so many choices in the Naperville area I think I&#39;ll probably look for another place to try next time."

The buratta is a bit pricey for cheese, but it was very creamy and good. The diavolo was delicious, especially if you love spicy food, and the margherita did not disappoint. Overall, would definitely return to this great spot!"

This pizzeria does look and feel like a place you would see on the North Side. I would say it&#39;s a very &#34;adult&#34; restaurant, although there were kids dining as well (which I had no problem with). Pizzeria Neo has a nice lounge area, a big bar, a big pizza bar where you can watch the cooks fire the pizzas up, and tables all around. The chairs weren&#39;t too comfortable, but you&#39;ll forget all about that once the food comes. 
     Our server was nice, but it was a bit busy since it was an early Sunday evening. Maybe the place was a bit understaffed, but service was not as attentive as I would have liked. You have to ask for water if you want a drink (it also says that on the menu as well). We ordered the bruschetta. You can pick 3 for 10 bucks as a sampler plate. The mushroom bruschetta was the best out of our three choices. For pizzas we tried the diavolo and the bianco. The diavolo is awesome-just the right around of spice to the sauce and meat. The bianco had a to-die-for garlic sauce. The crust was great too. Just a warning-the pizza does get a bit floppy towards the end of the slice (I know some Chicagoans who would rather get stabbed in the eyeball with a fork than eat floppy pizza. I am not one of those people.) For drinks, we ordered a pineapple martini and a glass of sangria. The martini was just ok, but the sangria was great (and the glass was huge). 
     It&#39;s nice to have somewhere to go to in the suburbs that has a laid-back city vibe. Next time I&#39;d like to go later in the evening and just chill out on one of the sofas for a bit (while eating delicious food of course)."

Most of my friends either live in the city and would have to be dragged kicking and screaming out the &#39;burbs, or are are married and closer to (or past) retirement age, married, and not really up for the mildly wild nights that this feral female sometimes craves. **The exception being Andres D... who happens to be stuck somewhere in the middle with me and deserves some major recognition for letting me drag him around all the time. 

So anyway, I often get the itch to go out to hip, new places but at the same time I don&#39;t always want to have to drive to the city to get a taste of the trendy (which is essential for wannabe suburban hipsters like myself), but luckily I&#39;m a resourceful suburbanite who keeps a watchful eye on anything that could qualify as the next big thing in the &#39;burbs, and that&#39;s exactly how I came upon Pizzeria Neo. 

First off, it should be said that this is by far and away the hippest and least doupie (douche-y + yuppie) place in downtown Naperville. It was actually ultra chic... so much so that I actually almost regretted not wearing make-up or clean clothes, but lucky for me it&#39;s pretty super dark in here so I think I still looked semi-human and it also spelled like Neopolitan pizza heaven so I&#39;m fairly certain whatever odor I may or may not have had on my was masked by the market fresh burrata on special that night. 

Right away I was excited to see that they had a real-deal cocktail selection, nice but still affordable wines and pretty great craft beer selection, although they only serve in bottles at the moment. I went with Dark Horse raspberry ale and have zero regrets beyond that I ended up ordering two and probably could have been fine with one based on how close I came to peeing my pantalones on the way home. 

You MUST get:
Classic Margherita pizza
Whatever their special pizza is that night
The bruschetta sampler with the eggplant, red pepper, and olive toppers.
The veggie meatball - tremendously good
A side of olives (they have several different kinds, of which I&#39;m sure you can&#39;t go wrong)

I think it&#39;s fair to say that if this place remained exactly as it is and were plucked from the &#39;burbs and placed in the city, it would be packed. To the brim. Every night.

I love that they have a cocktail bar and a bruschetta bar located in near the brick, wood-fired oven. I think it&#39;s a nice intimate alternative to sitting at the booze bar because you don&#39;t feel obligated to chit chat with people next to you because instead you&#39;re way busy scarfing down 3 different types of artisanal bruschetta. 

We also indulged in the mixed grilled vegetable small plate which turned out to be a vegetarian &#39;meatball&#39; made with breaded, baked eggplant that was redonk. We were going to get one of their salads to share between my party of three, but then didn&#39;t because... well, because pizza. Why would I get a salad when I could get TWO pizzas instead? No brainer there. 

So we went with the classic Margherita which that was my hands-down favorite and totally what I&#39;ll be scarfing down without sharing next time, and also the special market-fresh burrata pizza with arugula and other healthy stuff. The special pizza was the favorite of both my dining partners, which worked out perfectly as it distracted them from how much of the margherita pizza I was eating."

Where is the good brunch? Where is the good ANYTHING I MISS FROM LIVING IN CHICAGO. It&#39;s been two years that we&#39;ve lived out here and try as I might, I can&#39;t.

I can&#39;t comment on Neo&#39;s interior, which seems awesome and we&#39;ll definitely go back to investigate on a night when I&#39;m not in yoga pants by 8pm (holla at your social liiiife!). We got takeout. With so many amazing yelp reviews - I was certain this was finally it. FINALLY, DELICIOUS SUBURBAN PIZZA.

The pizza was a solid 3-stars. We got a margherita pizza and a meatsplosion pizza for my carnivorous husband (side note: Neo does not call this a meatsplosion. they are classy. I dubbed it said &#39;splosion after I opened the box and saw the generous smattering o&#39; meat). The sauce is whatever, the crust was soft and thin - if it had been crisp, I woulda been a happy gal. The toppings were delicious - even the meatstravaganza was tasty and weirdly not overwhelming - but the crust was so soggy. Bummer.

We also got the burrata antipasti - it&#39;s noted on the menu as &#34;market price&#34; which is a little intimidating, but we went for it (it wasn&#39;t that bad, price wise). They packaged it SO well for takeout, I was amazed. The burrata was rich, creamy, and a generous portion, on a bed of crisp arugula, accompanied by a delicious, almost lemony olive oil and a stack of perfectly charred toasts. We assembled our crostinis and dug in to PURE HEAVEN. It was easily the best mozz I have ever had and the accompaniments were perfection. Husband ordered a trio of additional crostinis that were also amazing - the funghi, the prosciutto, and the rapini (this being the most impressive, seeing as they got my husband to eat broccoli rabe, happily). 

I would go back and try dining in, or drinks and apps, or maybe even give the pizza one more try... I guess. I wanna eat that burrata for every meal of the rest of my life, I&#39;ll say that much.

Now someone find me a delicious suburban pizza and Philly cheesesteak, or I&#39;m moving back to Avondale."

In visiting the downtown Naperville area, I spotted this place one  night and thought it  was a classy bar, or higher end restaurant because it appears that way from the outside.  It&#39;s not.  It&#39;s a pretty classy pizza joint...ok, not joint but it&#39;s classy!  After looking at reviews I wanted to give it a try.  

6pm on a Friday the place was pretty dead so that&#39;s always a good thing, especially for this area.  Our server suggested the burrata as an appetizer (many others here speak of this amazing dish as well)  We didn&#39;t know it was a $16 appetizer, and that it was more than our meal but....it was worth it!  It was amazing!!! I&#39;m half Italian and I&#39;ve never even heard of this dish...the cheese reminded me of scrambled eggs but it was different and I&#39;m all about different when dining out so it was fine.  My friend ordered wine and I ordered the sangria - which comes in white, red, and rose.  White the sweetest, and rose the least sweetest so I opted for red.  It was good.

We always start with a cocktail or martini and split the Caeser Salad, it has the best cheese and grilled bread on the side.  Our usual order is the Bianco Pizza, simple yet delicious.  I must recommend our FAVORITE bottle of wine as well Donati, cabernet sauvignon.  This always sets the mood off right for a good night.  We have also tried the Diavolo, spicy but really good and the Marinara which has no cheese, it was interesting to try for something light and different.

Definitely will be here many more times to come!"

But before we even got there, disaster struck. I called Tuesday night to make a reservation, knowing how DT Naperville is on Friday nights. Packed. I was told they only take reservations for &#34;large parties.&#34; I find that strange. So if you are in a time crunch or don&#39;t want to wait in the bar or lounge, beware. 

Although...the bar area and lounge are pretty cool. Low silver couches and tables in the lounge. High sleek chairs along the bar. And of course a large tv. The whole atmosphere is actually super inviting. Dark, metallic, and simplistic. From the outside Neo seemed really small to me. But, like the Tardis, it&#39;s bigger on the inside. There&#39;s a seating area around the pizza oven as well for those of us that enjoy watching pizza dough being tossed and kneaded(yup that is my idea of fun). 

On to the drink. The specialty drink menu is pretty small. I enjoyed a rose wine sangria. It was ginormous and very good. My SM had a pineapple upside down martini as well as a Neapolitan, both tasty. My SS had a difficult time choosing a drink because the specialty drink menu is mostly martinis and that&#39;s just not her thing.  But thanks to MEGS M.&#39;s photo of the special strawberry lemonade, the bartender was able make that and add a shot of lemon vodka and everyone was happy! Well played, Neo.

For appetizers we did the Fontina  cheese and grilled zucchini, the Polpette Carni(meatballs), and the flight of 3 bruschetta. Carcoifi(artichoke hearts and Parmesan), Rapini(sausage and broccoli), and the traditional. Of the bruschetta, the Rapini was my favorite. Who knew broccoli could taste that good?! And the meat balls were among some of the best I&#39;ve ever had.  All of it was delicious.

We were so stuffed that we only ordered one pizza to share. It was half Speck and half Salsicia. The speck is basically smoked pork and had a wonderful arugula topping. The Salsicia is a spicy sausage with caramelized onions. Simple but delicious. And the crust was crispy and chewy, just the way it should be. 

5 star food.  I&#39;ll be back to try more delicious pizza."

That&#39;s always my litmus test at a new Neapolitan-style place.  If they can&#39;t do margherita, there&#39;s pretty much no point in trying any of the others, in my opinion.  It&#39;s kind of like basic eggs at a breakfast place.  Anyway, the margherita was very good here and I would gladly eat it again.  We also shared the artichoke, eggplant and chicken (I think) bruschetta, and they were tasty (though I didn&#39;t actually try the chicken bc I don&#39;t eat meat).  Service was friendly, but a little slow, even though the place was pretty dead that day.  There may have been 1 or 2 other tables occupied in the entire place.

I do not recommend getting the pizza carryout if you like your crust crispy.  This kind of pizza is really best eaten right when it comes to the table.  If you take it home and want a crispy crust, do what I do--heat it in a frying pan on the stove.  Or maybe on a very hot pizza stone.  But really, Neapolitan pizza is one of those foods that truly needs to be enjoyed right away, not put steaming hot in a box for even a few minutes.  Please keep this in mind when writing reviews of a pizza place, because it&#39;s not their fault that the crust gets a little soft while sitting in cardboard!"

Having no idea what the heck it was since you cant see much from the outside of it, I decided to do a little research on yelp. Everyone gave this place really great reviews so I decided to give it a try tonight with Rusty S., Tim M., and Amanda S. 

Let me start by saying the reviews about this place were dead on. We walked in and were sat immediately. It has very modern decor with one section of the restaurant with sofas and nice little coffee tables that you can eat at. It is very dimly lit which makes it sexy and romantic, with relaxing quiet music, the perfect place to go for a date. 

Our waitress, Jordan, wasted no time getting to our table to greet us and take our drink orders. She filled us in on all the specials and need-to-knows about the menu since it was our first time there. She was extremely knowledgable. I asked a lot of questions because the menu had many terms for food I had never heard of before. She was able to answer everything I asked. Great job, Jordan! More on her later...

We started with the meatballs as an appetizer. Im drooling just imagining them. As I&#39;ve stated in other reviews, my husband is from New Jersey and he knows good meatballs. THESE were GREAT meatballs! The appetizer comes with three large juicy meatballs covered in a thick, onion-y, garlic-y, basil-y, marinara and three pieces of italian bread. All for $9. It is good to share between two people, although my husband and I found ourselves debating over who would get to eat the third meatball.

Next, we ordered the margherita pizza and the diavolo pizza. These are legit pizzas. Im talking authentic napolean style pizzas. They are 12 inches round. You could definitely share one between two people but since it was our first time we splurged and ordered two different kinds. I would highly recommend ordering one white sauce pizza and one red sauce pizza.

Thats really all they have on the menu so dont go there expecting italian like chicken parm or pasta dishes. You will be disappointed. You can order bruschetta, pizza, salads, or you can order a platter with different kinds of meats, cheese, and olives that you choose from another smaller menu. Really thats all they need. The menu was limited but I love that. The things they do have they do VERY WELL. Why do you need anymore?

I also ordered the sangria because Jordan, our waitress recommended it. She says it is their own special house sangria. It was definitely special. For $8, she poured me a huge glass with wonderful, fresh fruit. We were there for awhile and Jordan was just awesome. She didnt rush us and she was great about refills and removing finished dishes from our table in a timely manner. 

I will definitely be back. I loved the atmosphere, I loved the food, I loved the prices, and the staff were great. My only complaint is that I didnt try this place sooner!!"

It was early and we were the second or third to take a table.  I have been on a quest to find the pizza closest to the Neapolitan pizzas of Napes, so every time I see an ad for this type of pizza I try to visit.
The restaurant/bar is very clean, but comes with a musty smell when we entered.  We really liked the service and the server was very knowledgeable with the menu and great beer and wine selection.  The food was average and had a good taste, but did scream as being Neapolitan Authentic, Neopolitan pizza has imperfections, gas bubbles in the dough, etc, while this pizza was too perfect and while we saw that the restaurant had a wood fired stove, the pizza flavor did not reflect this.  Give it a go if you are into trendy bars, but was outside of our taste."

We absolutely loved our pizza! The thin crust and wood burned crust was great and they actually make the crust right when you order your pizza. I enjoyed the margherita pizza which to my pleasant surprise had zero tomatoes on top!! Boyfriend got the 4 meat pizza and he loved it (the only comment is it needed a few more slices of meat) there literally was only 4 pieces of sausage on the whole pizza. Also the prices weren&#39;t too bad for the delicious food we received!  The pizzas are thin but come with 6 slices. Honestly one pizza per person is adequate.

I can&#39;t wait to go back and try the bruschetta (3 for 10) and a nice salad. I would highly recommend redecorating the interior, the place has no identity. And also maybe adding a real sign so people can actually find the place!  Don&#39;t bother making a reservation, there will surely be a seat open. Pizzeria Neo is a hidden gem right in downtown Naperville."

However, I gotta hand it to this place. The pizza, freshly made, certainly hit the spot for our group. They were, of course, skeptical when I suggested we try it. But, thankfully, there was nothing but positive feedback after we left for the night. 

Staff was pleasant, and very hospitable. The food came timely. Appetizers were delicious and pizzas were on point. This was a great find while spending our time in the area."

We came here on a Thursday night to celebrate my birthday. This is my 2nd time here and the first time, I&#39;d have to say that the pizza was phenomenal. We started out with the burrata and Polpette Carne as appetizers. On a side note, if you run out of bread, you can request more. The burrata is by far my favorite. I love the creaminess of the mozzarella and this is one of the few places where the cheese is pasteurized. We also ordered the meat and cheese plates, which was very good and I felt that the portion was decent. For the pizzas, we ordered the margherita with mushroom and the Quattro Carne. The margherita seemed like was cooked too long (the basil leaves were burnt) and it seemed like it didn&#39;t have enough cheese. The Quattro Carne, on the other hand, seemed to come out fine, and my brother and husband seemed to like it overall. Will be here again, but hopefully our pizzas will come out like the first time I came."

So enjoyed dining at this establishment. The atmosphere definitely doesn&#39;t shout pizzeria except for the small pizza oven in the rear.  There is a lounge area with bar as you enter with leather couches and chairs. The restaurant has both high top and low top tables.  It looks like a chic minimalistic restaurant/bar in the city.  It would have been a romantic evening with the low lighting ... well, except for the non-stop crying baby which other patrons were moving to the rear of the restaurant to avoid. I&#39;m a mom and have sympathy, but this place does not look or feel like a family place at all.  Our server Tim was extremely friendly and provided great service. We shared an appetizer and pizza. We really enjoyed the meatball appetizer with crostini. The three meatballs were very soft and seasoned well and the marinara sauce was very good. It was topped off with shaved Parmesan and served with grilled crostini.  My Italian dad makes the best meatballs and these were right there!  For an entree, we shared the prosciutto and arugula pizza.  Very good and reminiscent of those I enjoyed in Italy. A crispy and partly charred bubbly crust topped with fresh ingredients...what&#39;s not to enjoy?  I will definitely be back!"

I prefer bianco pizzas but I had to make a compromise so we got one of each. 

The salsicia was phenomenonal, I could actually go for some right now. It was a nice mix of Italian sausage and the sweet carmalized onions.

We also ordered their signature margherita pizza. It was petty good but since I prefer white pizzas, I don&#39;t think I would be ordering that one again. We didn&#39;t get any drinks so I can&#39;t comment but a friend got the sangria and said it was amazing.

I hope this place has longevity! Id like to go back for more pizza or a meat and cheese platter!"

We started with the Bruscetta trio and got the rapini, prosciutto/arugula, and roasted pepper. So so good and loved that they split each one in half. Next we got the meatballs and truly, they were awesome. Coming from an Italian family I usually don&#39;t like restaurant meatballs but these (and the sauce) were delicious.

We arrived at the restaurant at about 6:00 on a Thursday and were able to choose where we were seated.  We chose a high table but there were also lower tables and booths as well as seating at the bar, which was neat as you could see the ovens as the pizzas were being cooked.  There were others dining but it was not crowded.  When we left around 7:00 it was starting to fill up.  The restaurant is dark as others mentioned but I think it made for a nice environment with the high ceilings, open ductwork, etc.  

Service all around was fantastic.  I think our server&#39;s name was Jordan and she was very prompt, polite and informative.  Her best move was giving us a rundown of the craft beer selection that was not on the menu.  My wife ordered a Wobbler from Two Brothers (very good) and I had 1090 IPA (also good - very bubby for a beer).  She poured our beers for us and took the order pretty quickly after we decided.  She checked on us throughout and was very friendly.

The appetizer was bruschetta and it was good for what it was.  I&#39;m not a fan of mushrooms but the portabella one wasn&#39;t bad since it featured a good share of arugula.   The others were roasted pepper and prosciutto, which were ok. 

My wife ordered the Diavolo pizza and I had the Quattro Carne.  We traded one piece and they were both amazing.  The Diavolo was a little cheesier than the meat, but both were tasty and crisp.  The sauce was also good and just the right amount - not dry at all.  The pizzas are thin and individually sized, but even then neither of us finished.  The pizza by itself maybe but on top of a beer and appetizer it was a little too much.  We got them to take home and were just fine reheated the next day.  It&#39;s a nice alternative to the deep dish that is popular here locally. 

I would not consider it a kid-friendly venue; there was a family there with 2nd or 3rd grader, but there isn&#39;t a children&#39;s menu and the obvious focus here is on the atmosphere and the wine &amp; beer selection.  There is a lounge area as well with couches for the social meet-ups.  And not overly expensive; pizzas are in the $11-$16 range.  

All in all, great experience.  Good for a date or an after-work drink with co-workers.  Come for the pizza and ambiance but probably not with the kids. Definitely recommended."

It is in downtown Naperville where parking is very hard to come by on a Saturday night.  Lucky for us we got 5 inches of snow today so it wasn&#39;t as crazy as usual!  We parked in the parking garage next to Neo about 5:15.  We walked into Neo and it was empty.  The hostess was really nice and asked us where in the restaurant we would like to sit.  We chose a table away from the revolving door hoping to stay warm but I think there was cold air blowing on us from somewhere.  It is very trendy looking with high warehouse type ceiling and kind of an industrial look.  It is very dark, which is fine with me but my daughter didn&#39;t like it.  The music varies but was mainly techno but it wasn&#39;t played too loud so it was fine.  Our server, Kristopher,  was at our table within a minute explaining their offerings, items du jour and giving his recommendations.  He took our drink order and gave us time to look.  We went with his bruschetta recommendations which we were very happy with.  We all really liked the traditional and the mushroom.  We also ordered a Caesar salad that our server divided among the three of us (9 year old not interested in salad).  It was very good with shaved Parmesan cheese on it.  We ordered the meat red pizza and the white pizza with garlic and fresh mozzarella.  Both came out piping hot and were fantastic!  We all like thin pizza with crispy crust so both options were perfect.  Kristopher really did a great job, he refilled drinks when they were about 1/4 full and asked us how we were doing just the right amount of times.  
We will definitely return and are looking forward to trying other menu items hoping they&#39;re as good as what we ordered this eve."

Drop what you&#39;re doing right this second, run (if need be, I&#39;m very excited) to Neo and order their pasta special. It&#39;s a butternut squash ravioli and it is divine with a capital D.  

Okay, now that I&#39;ve caught my breath...

I&#39;ve been going to Neo since it opened and it is absolutely fantastic. 

Order the Burrata to start and throw in some prosciutto if you&#39;re feeling frisky. It&#39;s dreamy. Any pizza you get will blow you away, but if you&#39;re a sausage fan the Salsicia is the way to go. 

End note: Stop wasting time reading this and go. Go now.

1.  Different pizzaolo&#39;s seem to have different handling techniques... or the dough isn&#39;t consistent.  There was much more rise to the first time we were here (and slightly more charred bottom), while the 2nd and 3rd time produced less rise on the crust and less char on the bottom.  Still delicious, but not as consistent as before.

2.  Burrata is still delicious.  Check.

3.  The portebella bruschetta is phenomenal... it&#39;s a umami bomb in your mouth!  Roasted red pepper was delightfully sweet as red peppers should be.  Eggplant was decent, but clear loser of the three we tried.

4.  The melted gorgonzola is spectacular.  I&#39;ve never thought to have gorgonzola on Neapolitan style pizza before, so last night was an eye opening experience... with some funghi and gorgonzola, the flavor combination was spectacular.

If this continues, I may prove my wife wrong about how much we&#39;ll spend here... 

Verdict:  Yes, yes, and yes again.  Still a fav spot, but I hope they&#39;re able to get a more consistent high rise crust and better char on the bottom."

Ordered the Quatro Carne, also had em&#39; trow&#39; some basil and cherry tomato on it. Outstanding. Perfectly cooked, the ingredients all tasted of great quality. Wouldn&#39;t surprise me if their doing sausage in-house and even curing their own meats.

Neo&#39;s has by far made the best pizza I have eaten since moving to Illinois. The waitress we had was really knowledgeable and explained everything in great detail that we had questions about. If you go with someone I would recommend ordering a pizza for yourself, and then splitting them half and half. They have a list of pizzas with red sauce and white sauce, so we picked one of each. I cannot tell you how amazing the meatball appetizer was. I would go back to this place just for that. Just a thought, but maybe slice up those meatballs and put them on a pizza!"

Went in last night and being NYE, was crowded. However we asked to sit at the pizza bar and I would suggest if you want to see something different, try to sit in front of oven like we did. I learned a couple of things about pizza making.

Had the buratta for an app. and it should be noted it goes for market price. In our instance it was $16. For two people it was way more than enough, for 4 people it would be perfect.

We ordered the Quattro Carne and Arugula prosciutto, they&#39;re a perfect size for one person or to share with other people. I&#39;m a very picky eater and this was just perfection. Everything fresh and made to order. 

For families, this might be a little pricey but last night there were several families in for the holiday so if you&#39;re worried, don&#39;t be. For a date night, this would be a perfect place. The vibe is warming and inviting, good music in the background (not overpowering) and the wait staff was attentive but not pushy.

I&#39;ve worked in the industry before so I know how it is. After calming the storm, she approached me with very apologetic gestures and gave me the menu.

This place was PERFECT for a nice dinner out with my hubz, but we saw multiple types of groups there...from families to young friends to old friends to romantic dates, this place is perfect for just about anyone.

The decor and ambiance are that of a lounge. They have trance music playing in the background, and the place is very dimly lit with many candles. You can choose to sit at tables, in couches, at a bar, or at the pizza bar (it basically feels like you are sitting at a sushi bar...but instead, they are making pizza. 

You can get meat and cheese appetizers, which I definitely recommend! They give you a sushi-style menu that you mark off with pencil, and you pick out what meats or cheeses you want. We got the sharp provolone and some kind of meat that was aged in wine and garlic. They serve it with french bread and grapes, so basically like a meat/cheese plate. The flavors were out of this world! There were several aged meats and cheeses to choose from, so the possibilities are endless. For this appetizer, it was $11 for the two of us. I would go back here for this alone, because its a unique dinner experience.

Next we ordered bruschetta. They have several kinds to choose from, and for $10, you pick 3 different kinds (or all of the same). Let me tell you, these are enormous pieces of bread with a PILE of bruschetta on them. This could&#39;ve been a meal alone for my husband and I. We weren&#39;t full from the meat/cheese plate we ordered, but we were full after the bruschetta. I recommend the Rapini or Prosciutto. The Carciofi was ok, but it was just artichokes with parmesan. The others were bursting with more hidden flavors. 

Lastly, we ordered the Quattro Carne pizza. The server told us that one pizza was enough for only one person...to that, I say NO WAY. Unless you are a big hungry boy and you haven&#39;t eaten all day, this is a fairly sizable pizza. It&#39;s about the same size as a frozen pizza, but with a bigger crust and chunky toppings. The crust is thin and soft in the middle and fluffier on the outside, like oven-baked style. So while it&#39;s definitely not as big as Chicago-style deep dish, I would not say that one pizza could be a meal for one. It was delicious, fresh, and flavorful. You can choose from two kinds of pizza: Rosso (with a marinara sauce) or Bianco (with an olive oil sauce). We got ours Rosso style, but can&#39;t wait to try the other kind.

With a pizza, bruschetta, meat/cheese plate, one beer and one iced tea, our meal with $50 + tip. We had SO much flavorful, delicious food and the mood was perfect for a date night. Our server was also attentive and explained everything to us thoroughly (the menu can seem confusing at first). And two people could definitely have enough to eat with just one pizza, in my opinion. You could probably get an appetizer or side salad too, just to round out the meal (and I would recommend it, because there are sooo many good things on the menu!).

This could be an expensive or inexpensive place to eat, depending on what you are eating. Pizzas range from $10-$16, bruschetta was $10 for 6 HUGE pieces, all the meats/cheeses were $5-6 each. We chose to go the full nine yards with this place, which is why it was $50 for the two of us, but we&#39;ll probably spend less next time. I would also recommend this place for a group of friends, since most of the items are set up for sharing. They also have a full drink menu, so you&#39;ll be set for some brews or vino! I will note that they do not have any beer on draft, which is a bummer but not a game-changer.

My husband and I will definitely be back...and I plan on bringing my friends and family here too!"

This is the best fresh-made thin-crust pizza in Nap.  They make their own sausage.  For appetizers we tried a selection of cheeses and salamis. They handed us a list and we marked down our choices.  Price was based on how many we ordered.  There were no surprises in the cheese choices -- basic pecorino, parmesan, etc. -- but what we tried was good.  The pizza comes either white or red.  I liked both but the red sauce had that great salty / tangy / sweet balance, and then with the homemade sausage on top - omg.

Was told it would take 40 minutes (it&#39;s within 1-2 miles away from me).. Got a call after 40 minutes saying they knew it was running late but it was out.. Took another 30 minutes or so..

Pizza was cold... Had to reheat it in the microwave...And I ordered a Pepsi... They gave me a Diet Pepsi.

Called them just so they&#39;re aware of the mistakes..(I&#39;m a business owner myself), and truthfully it is annoying when places mess up simple things like that. They offered me a free Pepsi or something. I think I heard the gentleman say a &#34;credit on a *future* order.  Declined it. (A few bucks isn&#39;t going to do anything for me)...Told them I just called to let them know.

Mind you, I&#39;m writing this review, rather than eating my food because it was cold anyway.  

Hopefully they do better.. Nobody likes waiting that long.. Only to find out they messed up the order.

Little things.....

It sucks to see privately owned businesses make little mistakes like that.. It the little stuff that ends up hurting their business in the service industry.  (You know... Like accuracy, and service lol..)

Advice for management.. &#34;Hire slow, fire fast&#34;

Who knows.. ::sips his Diet Coke and eats his cold pizza::"

Sneak preview: they usually aren&#39;t. Just because you&#39;re small and unsuccessful does not make you delicious, sadly.

But Gelsosomo&#39;s I really do like. Is it the best pizza in the country? Nope, but its good, and one of the better options around this area for my money. They have a number of locations, but the one in Lemont is particularly nice. Large and spacious, with a buffet and a long beer list."

We ordered our pizzas to go - mine was fine but my husbands Calabrese was supposed to have 2 toppings, which we paid for and it only had sausage.

After having talked to her personally, I am confident that the incident was due to an unfortunate oversight and that this will not happen again. Furthermore, she shared her background in food safety as well as the owner&#39;s backgrounds which are all impressive.

It was really humid and stuffy in there and the waitress promptly fixed it. Our food was tasty- the works pizza is highly recommended. Salad was a salad, only big complaint was that there was a pile of pasta in the floor when we came in. It sat there for awhile before it got cleaned up. There were two employees with a calculator and their tips at the table next to it. I&#39;ve worked food service and I know it was a shift change but little things matter. Lisa, the manager, came by to check on us and was very friendly. 

Overall, pizza was good if you like dense cheese and sweeter sauce.

Service was average.

The tap has some local flair and the margarita was decent.

My wife &amp; I brought another couple out for some pizza, our waiter was Brandon he was a GREAT young man. We ordered 2 pizzas  1- garlic-green pepper-onion-Pepperoni, 1 BBQ pizza and a Combo platter onion rings double poopers. After a wait a lady manager came out to say that one pizza was screwed up, she said it be 5 minutes that lead to 25/30 later and when the pizzas came out they were cold.........and the garlic-green pepper-onion-Pepperoni pizza was so doughy in the middle of the pizza. the BBQ pizza sauce you can lick the sauce so COLD,  The manager never came back to see how they were. I did not make a issue.  we brought home over 3/4 of both pizzas

Much of the decor from &#34;The Place&#34; is still there - nice bar area with high-top seating and table seating in the dining room and expansive party room behind that.  We visited on a weeknight and the place was hopping with activity (good sign!)

Peg, the owner came around to all the tables to introduce herself and assure us that our experience was her first priority - very nice touch!  She also came around again after we finished to make sure we were happy - and we were!!

The family salad was a great kick off - crisp lettuce, tomato and shredded carrots - nothing fancy but served ice cold and topped with a delicious red wine vinaigrette.  We ordered a medium thin crust pizza with half sausage and half veggie.  I really like the flakiness and consistency of the crust.  The sauce is slightly sweet and the cheese is gooey and full of flavor, as were the toppings.  I was impressed!

The food upon delivery was cold. The pizza was...strange. No sure how else to describe it. The crust was nice and crispy, but so was the cheese. I believe the cheese mix used is very heavy in Parmesan, which gave a crispy texture and odd taste. At least I think the odd taste was the cheese. Whatever it was, something was just off. Add to this the overpriced appetizers, and this is an experience I won&#39;t be repeating. It&#39;s also worth noting that there were more leftovers than my family has ever left, and for the first time they were not saved. 

Bottom line? Overpriced, delivered cold and funky cheese makes Gelsosomo&#39;s a no go."

The owners are trying so hard and are very involved - nice to see people that really care about their business. 

The pizza was generously stacked - ours a veggie. Fresh ingredients and plentiful. Is it the best pizza ever? - no. But it is a solid pizza. And a really nice thin crust - maybe my fav part of the pizza. 

- Decent drink options. 
- Really nice vibe atmosphere wise - always important. 
- Wait staff was really friendly.  

We will go back for sure."

The pizza is consistently delicious, hot and crispy and the amount of toppings they put on each pizza is excellent as is the mix of cheeses and sauce they use!

Had the thin crust with their sweet sauce.  A must have.  Attentive servers.  This is not fast food so enjoy a micro brew while your pizza is being prepared.

I was told that it would be an hour because they were busy.  When I got to the restaurant to pick up my order, after an hour it was STILL NOT READY and they could not get me my sides.  I waited for 25 more minutes for the sides one of which never came.  WARNING... the picture of the pizza on the menu and the website resemble NOTHING to what was in my pizza box. The sauce was tasty, but the cheese left little to be desired.... perhaps because my pizza was sitting for so long, waiting for a side that never showed.

The place itself is very comfortable with plenty of TV&#39;s showing every sports program. However, if you stray from the pizza, you&#39;ll be disappointed. Appetizer plates were small and the salad was nothing short of bagged greens from the local grocer. Sandwiches were blah at best.  I would recommend going for the pizza, but avoid other menu options.  Hopefully the owners will take note of criticisms.

Was told that the fryers are the problem.  Yea Right!!  Service was ok but had to wait sometime for a drink.  Decided i would come back because the pizza looked Good.  Finally made it back for the Pizza!!  Same story we ordered calamari(frozen and Over priced)  and a Large Pizza.  Calamari was right up and then we waited for ever for a pizza that was visibly Burnt.  Manager said he would put in a rush order for a new pizza. laughable.  Pizza took longer to come out.  All in all 1 hour and 50 minutes for two people to have a pizza!!!  When the Bill arrives no discount what so ever.  Talked to manager again and he finnally gave me half off the Pizza.

Good vibe, lots of TVs, &amp; staff. Disappointed in our server as she got our order incorrect--twice! We ordered 1 x 10&#34; cheese pizza for our 3 kids and instead they each were served 6&#34; personal cheese pizzas. Although this was a mistake, we let it go because the kids loved the pizza and we&#39;d have leftovers. My wife&#39;s order was correct and came later as we had planned but mine (a 6&#34; personal pizza) did not. When I inquired, she said something about it taking longer because it&#39;s a pan. I later realized she had placed the order for a 10&#34; deep dish which takes 45&#34; and is NOT what I ordered.  Although, she was a bit defensive when we pointed out the errors, she and the manager, Jim Thompson, made it right. I ended up taking the deep dish to go...and it was rather tasty!

The thing that sets Meatheads apart is that they have &#34;Chef Inspired&#34; burgers so you don&#39;t have to pick your own toppings.  This comes in handy for me because my ladyfriend hates making choices.  

I got the 1/3lb Hawaiian burger when I went.  Perfectly cooked patty with pepper jack cheese, pineapple, bbq sauce, jalapenos and bacon.  Added the fresh cut fries as a side and I had a solid gluttonous manly meal.  Of course if I was a real man, I would have gotten the 1/2 lb burger instead.  *Sighs*.  Anyway, it was a great burger.  They offer a variety of crazier toppings and sauces like cucumber wasabi sauce, sauerkraut and fried eggs if you are feeling crazy. I wouldn&#39;t pair those 3 together but knock yourself out.

Sadly I only made 1 trip as my work in the area was done just a few days after discovering this gem.  If I&#39;m in Naperville ever again and craving a burger, this is my spot."

We&#39;ve tried the burgers and fries which are very delicious with a few styles and options. It&#39;s really nice that they have ketchup &amp; mustard at the table and the staff takes away your trash along with delivering your order to the table!  The hot dog bun is unique and the meat is topped with mustard and I added onions and pickles...no relish. 

The drink station is fancy with options, but I just go for water. How about flavored water?

Customer service earns 5-star rating.

Tried Meatheads - Naperville for the first time tonight based on other Yelp reviews and my husband&#39;s love for meat.

Upon entering, the music is really loud. Normally I hate that, but they played music I enjoy--80s and 90s pop music, so it was more tolerable. The cashier, Magda (who we later found out was the manager) was very helpful explaining the menu, and the ordering process, since we told her it was our first visit.

We ordered the Californian burger, Texas Ranch burger, and regular-size Cajun fries. We asked her to please cut our burgers in half so my husband and I could try half of each burger--they were very accommodating.

Based on you Yelpers, I was really looking forward to the Cucumber Wasabi sauce on the Californian. I like wasabi! Unfortunately, we were disappointed because we didn&#39;t taste wasabi, nor cucumber. When the employee, Mariella, was cleaning up the dining room, she came over and courteously asked us how our meal was. We explained our disappointment with the Cucumber-Wasabi sauce, and she brought over some sauce in a cup so we could try it with the fries. Really, all we tasted was sour cream and ranch, not wasabi nor cucumber. But it was very nice of Mariella to do that for us.

We liked the Texas Ranch burger a bit more than the California, but I was disappointed because the red onion was overpowering and that is all I tasted. Both burgers were greasy, a bit too much for me. And the buns were only room temperature, a tad chilled. I would have hoped for a warmed bun.

As far as the Cajun Fries, I don&#39;t know what all the hoopla is about. They taste the same as every other restaurants seasoned fries. But, the jalapeno ketchup and chipotle ketchup are great. 

So, all in all, while the burgers are similar to Five Guys and That Burger Joint, Meatheads burgers are a cut above because of the creative topping combos they offer.

While the burgers were of average interest to us, we WOULD DEFINITELY RETURN because (1) the customer service was great, (2) the restaurant dining area and condiment area were very clean, and (3) we will try other burger and fry options (like bacon cheese fries) to see if there is something more appealing to our taste buds :)

Great Service Magda and Mariella."

I am still not impressed.  I ordered the 1/3 pounder with cheese with mustard and mayo, as did Ms T.  I added pickle.  Believe it or not a 1/3 lb burger is made with two 1/6 lb patties.  I found them to be very dry and really flavorless.  The did not have flattop grill flavor or salt or much, if any beef flavor.  To top it off, neither of us received the cheese we ordered.

For a quick diner-style burger, we are fans of our local Smashburger in St Louis.  While I can&#39;t speak for all Meathead locations and all Smashburger locations, I have to assume they are pretty well standardized.  Smashburger wins, hands down.  The dryness and general lack of flavor at Meatheads is the real issue, not the fact that they failed to add the cheese.

Next time we will try the Smashburger at Rte 59 and Aurora to test for consistency, location to location."

Made the drive from Yorkville and was so looking forward to the fresh ingredients and fries. Grilled red peppers are my favorite! And the pickles!

Something is different at this location. Or, maybe Meatheads as a whole has changed their burgers? The burger patty seemed flatter and the bun was definitely different. It did not hit the spot like Bloomington did :(

I was convinced (albeit, with a giftcard) to return, but not for quite some time later. Hubby and I walked in, braced with $25 and ready to give this place another shot. 

I walked in with a critical, but open, mind. The place was packed - clearly they&#39;re doing something right! Alas...as I was soon to find out, still, they didn&#39;t do anything right for us. 

We ordered carry-out, and then stood for an awkward ten minutes trying to figure out what to do. Where do we stand? We were in the way every where. Do we sit? Well that didn&#39;t seem right, the place was packed and we didn&#39;t want to steal someone&#39;s prospective seat. We felt like that awkward couple, shoved in the middle of a dance circle with no moves to be had. We finally got our order (milkshake about 5 minutes prior to the meals) from a very friendly manager. 

The menu is fun, but it&#39;s still a bit expensive for very, very thin burgers. For a gal that can barely finish a Big Mac, I could still finish a double patty here, as they&#39;re so incredibly thin. I would prefer more char, if the patties need to be that thin. 

The fries come in a MASSIVE quantity. I&#39;m also a fan of all things spice and specifically, Cajun, the &#34;Cajun&#34; seasoning left much to be desired. The regulars were seasoned better and delicious. 

We had a few extra bucks, so I got an Oreo shake, as well. SUPER yum. 

I&#39;d come back for the fries and shake. But I&#39;m still not sold on anything else."

I&#39;m glad I did, because I&#39;ve bumped my review up to 4.5 stars! From my initial (drive-thru) visit I was concerned with the large amount of grease in my bag and the lack of money left in my wallet. This time around I have no complaints about either.

My husband and I stopped in for a late lunch around 2:30 pm. The restaurant atmosphere was clean and relaxing. There were about 3 or 4 other tables dining in as well. The menu seems simple enough, but you can actually do a bit of modifying which I enjoy! The guy working behind the counter (seemed to be a manager?) was super helpful. He let us know that you can substitute any of their burger combo&#39;s with chicken, or you can get the combo without meat at all turning it into a super fancy grilled cheese. Nice! I noticed this time around that they have a few healthier options such as a chopped salad and veggie melt (I&#39;ll be trying that next time).

I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich with lettuce, tomato, and mayo (but you can choose any toppings you want). My husband went with the Cajun Sunrise (with grilled chicken instead of the burger) which comes with a fried egg, pepper jack cheese, bacon, blue cheese sauce, lettuce, tomato, and jalepenos. We both split a regular order of the cajun fries which I highly recommend doing - it&#39;s a lot for one person!

They offer self serve fountain drinks, iced tea, and bottled beverages, but we opted for a free cup for water (claaaasic us). Next to the drinks they also have a solid collection of hot sauce, steak sauce, and other fancy condos for your sandwich.

While initially shocked by the price of my burger the first time around, I have to say now that it&#39;s well worth the money. They use 1/3 lb. certified angus beef and all natural hormone free chicken which are both things I&#39;m willing to pay for. Plus you get a lot of food for your money!

My only complaint: the messiness of my sandwich. I&#39;m not sure if it was the mayo or the juices from the chicken, but it was a war zone trying to eat politely. Would have prefered less of whatever that situation was.

Somethin&#39; extra: They played GREAT music in the restaurant! I&#39;m talkin&#39; anything from old school Christina, to new country, to oldies but goodies. I don&#39;t know about you, but nothing completes a lunch like a little &#34;Genie in a Bottle&#34; throw back."

The food is great for the price (and there are lots of free, extra toppings you can add on as well which is always a plus). 

Ordering is very quick and even if you go at a fairly busy time, there are usually quite a few seats to choose from to quickly sit down and wait for your food. And food can be gotten pretty quickly. We also do take out a lot of times and that process is very simple as well. All you have to do is just call in with your order and in around 10 minutes you can go in, pay and pick up your food. 

The quality of the food is also good for a more fast food oriented joint. I love the crispy chicken sandwich and you are substitute either the crispy or grilled chicken for any of their speciality burgers. We usually also order fries to go along with our food and you get a good amount of yummy fries for the price as well! (Though sometimes they can be overly salted) 

All in all, Meatheads gives you a good experience. Though it is, of course, more expensive than your average Burger King or McDonalds, but it does give good service and food in a casual environment."

We stepped up to order and we were kindly greeted by Eric, the manager. He took our order and informed me that I was making an excellent choice with the Texas Ranch Burger because it was one of their top sellers. My husband, again, ordered the patty melt because he fell in love with it the first time we came. 

The burger was out if this world. It was two thick juicy pattys of meat smothered in cheddar cheese and ranch sauce. It also included a very fresh piece of lettuce and tomato, two pieces of delicious bacon, and four pickles. FOUR pickles! It was so hot and juicy but the fresh toppings gave it a nice crunch! The ranch sauce was definitely not lacking this time. It was oozing out if the burger. Make sure you have a lot of napkins!

The condiment area was very neat, clean, and well organized. As soon as a customer moved something out of place, an employee would come out from behind the counter and fix it.

2 things worth mentioning:  I called and asked if they had veggie burgers for my vegetarian daughter and was told that they did.  Not so.  Disappointed in the lack of knowledge.  
I also asked for no lettuce with my burger - a naked burger with cheese and no embellishment including lettuce and it still came with a giant piece of lettuce which I removed but it was gross b/c it was soggy with meat juice.
BUT, my burger and another person&#39;s burger were delicious as were the regular french fries.  I&#39;d go back for the food, but Benito is a definite draw!

Living in Chicago (proper) for 24 years and out in rural areas like Southern Illinois/no-where Indiana for 7 years, I&#39;ve had anywhere from grass-fed burgers to 97% hormone injected burgers. DMK Burger, Kuma&#39;s Corner II, Tom&#39;s Place (Southern IL), [Insert 100 more burger joints from all over the US], Five Guys and even Culver&#39;s have all been chewed up and digested by this man.

I am still wondering why this establishment has such a highs reviews. Don&#39;t get me wrong, the service is a 5 / 5, no question about it - it actually merited another star just for the service. Everyone there was as polite and respectful as can be. But the (3) three, 1/5 inch medium-well grass fed burger patties piled on the bun didn&#39;t have much taste. If I&#39;m going to rate this a 4-5 star burger joint, give me the 3/4 inch meat and have me cook it as I&#39;d like (medium-rare). Sure, they have almost every topping possible to pile on (even avocado) but that just masks the taste of the meat.

I don&#39;t get the raving reviews. I&#39;d go as far to say Culver&#39;s has a better burger. I&#39;d trade in three paper thin medium-well done patties for a thick medium-rare any day.

This is one of those burger joints that is hurting the business of McDonald&#39;s,  with its nicer ambiance,  and greater choice of condiments.  You&#39;re not going to find avocado at Mickey D&#39;s. Apart from the fries, which are excellent,  I find the food unremarkable.  I make much better burgers myself.  And when you order a &#34;1/3 Pound Meathead,&#34; all they do is place two very thin burgers on top of each other. Would it be too much to ask for one solid burger? I really don&#39;t think that would drive up labor costs. I&#39;m not expecting Kobe or anything.  And I always find that my burger (s) are constantly slipping out from the bun. Which, by the way, is seedless.  A choice between seedless and seeded would be preferable.  I believe the bun I received was lightly toasted.  Very popular with the park district soccer community.

I ordered their limited time Mediterranean Chicken sandwich with feta fries.  The hubby ordered a burger and Cajun fries.
15 minutes later...not a single soul had come inside and only 1 car waiting in the drive thru.  My hubby had just gotten up to see what was taking so long when he saw the girl bringing our food.  No apology on how long it took.  The feta fries were cooked but barely warm at all.  I took them back up the counter and asked for a new batch of hot ones.  They said no problem.
My Mediterranean chicken sandwich seemed twice as thin as their regular chicken breasts and nothing tasted Mediterranean about it.  
The 2nd feta fries came back hot and tasted great until I got halfway through eating it and found a long hair in it.
All these things really ruined my impression of this place.  The gal gave us a coupon for a free burger but the excuse of ours being the first order of the day didn&#39;t fly with me.  My hubby might go back for the free burger but I won&#39;t."

Like I said before this is a good place to eat, you can have your burger made your way with fresh ingredients that you can actually see them put on the grill. You cant get that from burger king. lol.

I&#39;ve tried Meadheads on more than one occasion.  I ordered the California burger (tomato, lettuce, avocado, pepperjack, and cucumber wasabi), as well as a regular cajun fries with cheese sauce.  Total:  $10.50.

Yeah, it&#39;s more than an indulgence.  It&#39;s the fast food version of impulse shopping.  It&#39;s awesome, it smells good, it looks good - and then you get back to work/home and your bag is sopping wet with grease, and your cheese isn&#39;t on the burger.

Aside from the cheese dilemma, the burger was OK.  The two, thin patties are confusing.  Why not just make one thicker patty?  The patty itself didn&#39;t have much flavor, but was saved by the cucumber wasabi sauce.  But there was another problem:  most of the burger didn&#39;t have any sauce.  The avocado slices are generous, but adds to the greasy, slippery burger experience that is Meatheads.  I&#39;ve also had the same problem with chicken sandwiches here.  C&#39;mon, I&#39;m paying $5-6.50 for a burger, can&#39;t they invest in bigger, better buns?!

Cajun fries are good, and so is the cheese.   But they really nickle and dime you on add-ons here.  There is a create a burger option for picky eaters or creative minds.  But it&#39;s really just another gourmet fast food hamburger place.  In the fight between Meatheads and Five Guys, I like Five Guys better since they offer a smaller burger option.

Also, there is a drive-thru, which Five Guys doesn&#39;t have.  However, because they are made to order, you will have to wait around 10 minutes for your order.  Add another 2-3 minutes if you have to wait behind another patron.

I can see why some people love it, but I&#39;m just not on this bandwagon."

The condiments and extras are varied but entirely support the sandwich. I would have been very disappointed if I had ordered a plain burger with very simple toppings because the meat was not flavorful and was cooked in a particularly bland and nondescript manner. Others have been critical of the thin patties but I happen to like thin burgers when they are cooked properly so I was hopeful that they would still be delicious. These were not. Instead they were a grey-ish evenly colored un-charred bland lumps that were without much flavor. It&#39;s not that these burgers were bad, but they were not good either. I was further disappointed with the particular burger that I ordered - the Cajun Sunrise, with blue cheese sauce, bacon, fried egg, lettuce, tomatoes and jalapeños. The fried egg was entirely over cooked and was solid without any liquid yolk that is characteristic of a fried egg burger. The vegetables were so bulky on the burger that they overpowered the flavor. After removing the lettuce &amp; tomato to try to enjoy the burger more I became more disappointed in the lack of flavor - it was simply too weak to put up a fight against the toppings.  I expected more from this restaurant. I won&#39;t be back given the variety of other choices in the area.

I had the 1/3 lb. &#34;meathead&#34; and regular fries.  The was a substantial amount of fries for the &#34;regular&#34; order so I could not complain since fries are my FAVE!  Cute lil&#39; &#34;dip or squeeze&#34; ketchup packets were included in my order.  The meathead burger was tasty and definitely satisfied my craving for a burger! The flavors and amount of ingredients were appropriate and proportionate to the burger.  In the meathead burger, there were two thin patties.  Interesting.

Portions of &#34;regular&#34; fries are HYOGE. We ordered 2 burgers and a kids hot dog meal, and my husband and I split an order of regular fries no problem. The fries also still have the skin on them. - Yes. Good. NOM.

LOVE THE FRIES.  I just had to repeat it just in case you didn&#39;t catch my drift.

In terms of the burgers, they&#39;re very good.  I usually get the li&#39;l meathead because they give you so many fries it&#39;s just too much food for me.  I like that I can make my own combinations.  That&#39;s great!  I&#39;ve had the grilled chicken too and that&#39;s good because I can add all kinds of different sauces, cheeses, toppings and make it really fun to eat.

I haven&#39;t tried the fish this year but last year I had it and it was pretty good...I think they added like a wasabi sauce which is pretty fun.

In terms of the shakes, my husband and I got them once and were pretty disappointed.  It could have been an off day but they were pretty liquidy and just kind of ordinary.  In a way that&#39;s good because it&#39;s saved me the calories but maybe not great for them because I&#39;m not buying them.

We used to take the kids there because they had a free kid&#39;s meal when the boys read 5 books.  It was very generous and we went there several times and got free kid&#39;s meals but now I think it&#39;s gone.  Maybe they don&#39;t have to give a full kid&#39;s meal but maybe like a free burger or something?  I think people like some kind of free something...it still encourages them to come in the door...but maybe not give away the whole meal.

In summary, it&#39;s a like.  The fries push it over the edge for me.  I honestly think they are my favorite fries I&#39;ve ever had!"

But seriously, only go here if you are throwing health to the wind, like if you are giving up forever on your diet and you want to plunge headfirst back into pretending that calories and fat are just a ploy made up by communists to keep us from eating the things we want.  It&#39;s all completely delicious and terrible for your health, and they make no apologies for it. 

If you have a flavor deficiency that day, get the BACON RANCH sauce for your fries. The first time I tried it, I started laughing. How is this a real thing? It tastes like ranch sauce that someone squeezed bacon drippings into. Which might sound gross...but it&#39;s not. Just go try it sometime. It&#39;s worth the trip.

And I&#39;m giving it 5 stars? Despite my arteries clogging up, just from talking about this place? Some places out there don&#39;t try to be healthy for you, and that&#39;s ok. Their prerogative is just to satisfy you by any means possible. That&#39;s Meatheads. I mean, check out the name: MEATHEADS.

I have to say, every once in a while, I need a good burger and fries. This is my new favorite spot! Especially when I want to indulge but don&#39;t want to drive and wait in line at Portillo&#39;s, or eat in a loud pub or restaurant. This place is fast, provides good service, and the restaurants are fun, but mellow, and, definitely clean. 

Love, love, love their chicken strips, as well as the skinny, tasty burger patties, and their awesome toppings. We also have found that the cheese sauce for the fries is amazing - tastes homemade. A thousand times better than Portillo&#39;s. 

Also like that they have a couple vegetarian options if I want one (Veggie melt or Avocado, Lettuce, Tomato, Mayo sandwich).

Burger was overcooked for my tastes...dried out as well. The egg i had on my cajun burger was also way over cooked dried out and hard.

I&#39;m surprised there is a drive through.. the food seems like it wouldn&#39;t be very quick.. and I was informed it was quite a wait.

However, I thought my &#39;build your own burger&#39; was pretty daaaang good.  Every once in a while I crave a burger... and usually, I go somewhere, and am disappointed.  I was glad to not be severely disappointed tonight.. considering I was hungry, tired, overworked, and our stupid apartment complex can&#39;t seem to get proper working fire alarms.

I liked the different choices you could chose from and loved that the jalapenos were fresh and spicy!

The fries were just, OK.  By the time he got home, they were kind of cold.. not unexpected.

It looks like now I&#39;ll have another place to consider.  This place was pretty good.  It&#39;s decorated pretty nice inside for a little fast food place.  The service was pretty normal and pleasant enough.  You order then the they bring the food to you at your table, which is nice.

So the food...the burger was really damn good!  I had a NY Reuben burger, which had swiss cheese, grilled onions, sauerkraut, and thousand island dressing...yum!  It came with a side of fries and they give you ton!  I didn&#39;t even come close to finishing the fires.  The fries are as fresh as it gets.  They cut the potato up right then and there.  You can really taste the difference.  Also, all their ingredients for their burgers are all natural, fresh, never frozen, not processed - which is a bonus in my book.  The awesome part about this place also is all the burger toppings you have to choose from to make your own burgers, as well as various dipping sauces for fries and stuff.  I wish I would have tried a dipping sauce.  I can&#39;t wait to go back sometime and try other burger toppings too.

For me since the burger was just as good, and we spent just as much money as we would at Culver&#39;s the fries alone at this place give it an edge for when I have a burger craving.  I&#39;ll certainly be going back to Culvers too, but I like that I have a new, second option for when I&#39;m craving that occasional burger!"

It was eggs, sausage, toast and breakfast potatoes. He liked his food. One day I had the turkey sausage hash and the next day I had the traditional eggs benedict. I&#39;ve have scrambles from another breakfast place and this one was nothing like the other one which was good. It seemed like everything was a separate entity. It didn&#39;t flow well together.  The eggs benedict wasn&#39;t bad. That was my first time ever having eggs benedict be I would never eat a poached egg. I tried it another time and it wasn&#39;t bad at all. My husband and I both split the French toast both days. It had a good taste but was soggy. My husband that it was good but I didn&#39;t. The second day I didn&#39;t eat that much of it.

The pork belly amuse bouche was a nice touch. We were very pleased with the delicious scallop appetizer that came with a brown butter/balsamic concoction. The shishito peppers were very flavorful as well. The good times ended there. My pork tasting entree, while it sounded very well thought out, failed in execution and flavor profile. My husband&#39;s ribeye entree was something you can find at a chain fast casual restaurant. 

Cherry on top was something that&#39;s never happened to me before-they lost my coat that I coat checked!There was no apology offered that night.

Between your standard courses- Appetizer, entre, desert, the staff brings out very interesting sampler size dishes (artichoke heart with tomato chutney and balsamic, some kind of lavender ice cream to clear the palate, etc). For the appetizer, I had a Caesar salad, but did not taste remotely anything to Caesar salad. It was composed of lettuce, bacon, fried sunny side up eggs, and the dressing looked like a soapy bubble bath, but it was great. For the main course, Lobster and one of the juiciest steaks I ever had, with Brussel sprouts, artichokes, and very tasty garlic mashed potatoes. For desert, a soufflé topped with gold flakes. Not the best I&#39;ve ever had, but still exceptionally good. Me and my girlfriend decided to take the wine pairing which I kind of regret. For each of the 3 courses, the restaurant provided a wine that matched the course. I&#39;m no wine enthusiast, and the wine was pretty decent, but nowhere worth the ridiculous cost of $110 for a total of 6 half filled glasses between the two of us. At other elegant restaurants, you could grab a couple of good bottles for that price. Overall, an amazing experience.

Not bad.  Not bad at all.

For being in the burbs and being a hotel restaurant, Sugartoad surpassed my expectations.

Service was all I could ask for.  Friendly.  Attentive.  Great recommendations.

I ordered the pappardelle pasta with parmesan, eggplant, and rapini.  Increadibly rich and creamy white sauce.  Great grilled flavor from the eggplant.  

My husband went with the braised oxtail risotto with spinach.  So glad that he was full from his corn soup so I was able to have most of this dish to myself!  Risotto could have been more creamier but the oxtail was perfections-tender, flavorful-I must learn how to make this!  

We had leftovers of both dishes and both tasted even better the following day!

We didn&#39;t have room for dessert, but that didn&#39;t stop us from ordering it!  Could not pass up the chocolate croissant bread pudding with white chocolate icecream.  MMmm.mmm...mmm.  Flaky on top.  Chucks of chocolate pieces busting out of the croissant.  Just enough icecream.  TDF! to die for!

The first time our food was outstanding, 5 star experience all the way and I thought we found a real gem close to home! The place is empty on a Friday night, we knew it would be, so the atmosphere is not at all lively. They mostly do a weekday business with business travelers. The food, however, made up for it the first time. This past Friday, my wife and I went again and we were very disappointed. Service was fine and our waitress was very nice. Unfortunately, the food was below &#34;fair.&#34; I had the swordfish, which tasted fishy on the ends and was extremely overcooked. My wife had the lamb which was also very overcooked, completely brown all the way through. The only reason I can come up with for the huge swing in quality is we had a different chef that night? I don&#39;t know, but I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be back.

After giving it some thought, I&#39;m changing my review from 2 starts to 4. My first experience was so good, I think the bad experience we had the second time was just a fluke! I&#39;ll give them another try and make it 2 out of 3!"

Went on a Sunday evening and were literally the only ones in the restaurant. I have to admit that even though our first experience was terrific this had me a bit nervous.

Since it was our anniversary we were given two glasses of complimentary champagne to start off our meal. We had an appetizer which was a sampling of cured meats and pate. This was good but not over the top. 

The wine list is small but we were able to find wines which were appealing. 

My wife had the venison which she said was outstanding. Since this was her first experience with venison and she doesn&#39;t care for gamy foods it must have been prepared quite well. 

I had swordfish which was served with a lemon sauce, coos coos and spinach. The fish was cooked perfectly. Sauce complimented the fish well and there was not too much of it. 

Desert was good and after our meal the chef came to visit and get our opinions on our meal.

At any rate I had to give this place one star for a number of misses. 

Ok here we go.. 

I would say overall the food wasn&#39;t horrible but I had a few issues. This might be a preference but my side of fruit came to the table warm and looked like it was a few days past it&#39;s prime. The raspberries looked to be breaking down and the blueberries looked shriveled and might have been recovered from a box of cereal. The rest of the food wasn&#39;t really bad but nothing to really mention either. 

The next complaint would be the mimosa that was served with flat champagne. I just feel if a bartender is serving a mimosa and notices the lack of bubbles from the obviously old bottle of champagne maybe you open a new bottle. This was fixed when we sent them back but again this seems like a lack of effort from the staff. 

My last issue was the service staff. I really don&#39;t like to knock anyone in the service industry as we all have bad days and I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a tough job. With that being said the entire place had a sort of negative vibe. The place wasn&#39;t busy so it&#39;s a situation of being super busy. I even witnessed a server knock a full glass of coke over and gave the guy a couple napkins without even saying oops, sorry or oh geez that&#39;s embarrassing. She simply handed him a few napkins and walked away. lol  

Maybe this was just an off day but I felt I had to be honest and say I&#39;m sure there are better brunch options in the area."

We met friends here for a first parents&#39; night out, day after Valentine&#39;s day, and it also happened to be close to my birthday.  I was surprised at how empty the place was, for being so small.  The ambiance is nice, dimly lit, somewhat romantic, with contemporary decor and furnishings....

We started with drinks, and I went for a pre-dinner cocktail in lieu of wine, since it was my bday and all.  They had a list of &#39;winter cocktails&#39; so, figuring this was a signature drink, it should be great, and was happy to see one that included St. Germaine.  This was just....water.  It was a vodka drink that said it was infused w/ lime &amp; berries, St. Germaine and topped with a Thyme sprig w/ a splash of soda.  Sign me up!  I rarely drink since the Babe, and this tasted as though I ordered a plain soda water.  Barely any flavor from the St. G and nary a vodka taste in sight.  And wait...is that a ROSEMARY sprig in my glass?!  Um, yeah....For $12, I shook my head and had the hubs ask for more vodka after I took some sips of it.  Ugh.  Just...BAD

Forward to dinner - friends joined us and we ordered the Salumi platter and added cheeses and the tuna appetizers.  Both very good, delish selection of blue cheese, not a huge fan of the meat selection, but was happy w/ the size of the cheese platter and tuna was spot on.

We ladies split a Pappardelle pasta platter and the Atlantic salmon dishes.  The pasta was wonderful.  Cooked well, lovely cream sauce.  The salmon, on the other hand, was super dry, and the accompaniment was just weird and not good at all.  Being a high end restaurant, I would have expected that they get basic salmon right.  .  

My hubs had the steak and it was cooked to his request and he enjoyed the sprouts, which was his driver for even ordering the dish.  I was told the pork chop was fine as well.  

Service overall was just so-so.  Our waitress disappeared for a long time after she initially came to our table.  To the point where our chatty group was all wondering where she was so we could order more drinks.  She was nice enough, but seemed almost uncomfortable talking to us, and very inattentive.  

We also ordered 2 bottles of wine, and she never checked on us or our glasses after the initial pour, and we ended up filling our own glasses the rest of the time. 

They did redeem themselves a bit w/ the cheesecake covered w/ a tart berry sauce.  It was damn good, but that could be the wine talking!  My friends husband had cherries jubilee and it could not have been that good, as most of it was left on his plate.  

Very long story short, I am willing to pay good money for a great meal.  I wanted to like this b/c the name is fun and we are looking for good places since moving to the burbs from the city.  This was far overpriced for the mediocre service and average experience and food.  

We will not be back.  I recommend spending your $300 elsewhere!"

I am not one to write negative reviews, but I felt compelled to write one here as I have been looking forward to this place for years.  First, the service was terrible.  It took 20 minutes each time we ordered a class of wine.  Second, the main course was brought out too early and when they realized it, all they did was take it back and returned it to us cold (medium rare steak cold is not very good).  Finally, the cake that we had for desert was way too dry, and really couldn&#39;t eat it (considering we were once again waiting on wine to pair/wash it down with) .  Overall, for the high price of this place it was probably the worse dining experience we have had.  Your money will be better spent at any other place in Naperville."

My husband and I came here on a mission!  Their Chinese 5 spice Duck Breast.  My husband had this dish when we were out here for a wedding and has been talking about it ever since (June). 

We decided to have a little staycation and came out from the city and got a room for the night.  We had 8pm reservations but after getting out there we decided we wanted to eat in our room.  I had brought some good champagne and a pinot noir I knew would pair way better with the duck than their offerings.  

The girl at the hostess desk was very friendly and I glanced at a menu even though we knew that we would be getting the duck!  She told me it would be about 20 minutes and since we were hanging out in the lobby she would come let me know when it was ready.  

To our surprise when it was ready, a server (probably the same one that does room service) brought it over to us.  He was also very friendly.  They didn&#39;t add a service fee or a tip automatically for this which we appreciated so we did give him a tip.  

The meal did go great with our wine and I love the Farro side that comes with it with the smokey bacon and I believe kale.  The only reason they are getting three stars instead of 4.5-5 stars is that my duck looked very grey and was overcooked (although flavor still there) while my husbands duck was  red and slightly under.  Again, both still had great flavor and we still enjoyed our meal, but had to knock them for the consistency of the meat temp as this should come out perfect every time!  

We will still come back and try it again though."

I haven&#39;t eaten a lousy thing there yet! Seems kinda taboo to order a burger at this place because you know they had to put a burger on the menu to keep people coming in but...I&#39;m a sucker for it!! It is AWESOME. Beef is from a local farms and I swear that beef tasted so fresh I thought I heard it &#34;moo&#34;! I&#39;ve also had the scallops and their strip steak. To die for! I&#39;d be amiss if I didn&#39;t mention the bartender. A young gentleman (half Asian I think...look out for him and sit at the bar to eat. You&#39;ll get the best service there) with exceptional skill and even MORE exceptional customer service. My wife wanted an Irish coffee with whipped cream. Not common to put whipped cream on an Irish coffee but what did he do? Yea. He went back into the kitchen and whipped the cream himself!!! Then he made made me an old-fashioned and it was GREAT! Sugar Toad simply puts the other Naperville wannabe fine dining restaurants to shame. If you&#39;re in Naperville and looking for something extraordinary, go here!"

The first thing to know is that SugarToad is inside the Arista hotel- that way you aren&#39;t looking for a separate location. We came here for dinner on a Sunday night- and it was very quiet- there were only four tables total the entire time we were there (though the location is quite small). We each started out with a cocktail- I did not like mine- it had watermelon and gin- but I decided I just probably don&#39;t like gin (I&#39;d never really tried it before). We also started with a meat tray appetizer- it was wonderful with great pickled veggies. For our entrees we had the duck and the risotto- we both loved our entrees, and I had a lot of risotto to take home for a meal later. We finished up with dessert- I tried the ginger  creme brulee (wasn&#39;t a huge fan, though it was well made) and a peach bread pudding which was to die for! The setting was lovely, and the service was excellent- we would definitely come back in the future. Overall, I gave the four stars because a few of the dishes were slight misses- but most of what we had was excellent. A fun little place to check out if you are ever in Naperville."

Staff and decor were amazing. The menu has so much I want to try it was hard to choose.  I will have to go back to try the others.  The starter I had was braised pork belly in a reduction with an egg on top. It may be the best thing I ever tasted. Once blown away by the starter my ny strip arrived with Brussels sprouts cooked with bacon. That too was delicious. Words cannot describe how pleased I was with this dinning experience. I highly recommend this place and most defiantly try the pork belly.

It&#39;s the worst of both worlds: pricey hotel food in a location where fine dining prices are usually discounted relative to Chicago fine dining prices.

That&#39;s where Sugar Toad perplexes...in a good way.

The word &#39;Ambitious&#39; comes to mind. The menu and the food have evolved. Sugar Toad started out serving a tasting menu in its early days (perhaps a bit too ambitious). 

Humbled by the burbs, the menu transitioned to a la carte which is what us &#34;get in bed by 930 pm to wake up at 5am to beat the effen traffic to the city&#34; folks prefer.

The restaurant is located within the Hotel Arista---a very modern hotel just off the freeway exit for route 59. The restaurant has a small to moderate sized dining room. The decor is pretty straightforward.

The menu options , however, are surprisingly better to what you might find at many restaurants in Chicago. I came here with my wife and mother for dinner. I can say based on that meal that Sugar Toad is credible as a upscale casual dining spot. You  can spend between $50-100 a person here depending on what you order and alcohol.

The Citrus Cured King Salmon with creme fraiche is excellent. The salmon has a dense and silky texture that when paired with the creme fraiche proverbially melts in your mouth.

The Mussels with kaffir lime is a nice twist on a popular dish that leans somewhere between Belgium and Thailand.

The Little Gem Salad with buttermilk truffle dressing and Prosciutto is also a solid appetizer.

The short ribs are the fatty tender delicious morsels of beef that you exepct when you order this dish.

The dish that is worth going back for is the risotto with oxtail. parmesan, truffle oil, and lobster sauce. It was very decadent and packed with flavor. These are big bold flavors, but they were balanced.

The scallops with beluga lentils (not to be confused with beluga caviar) is  also a very solid main course.

The Pappardelle Pasta with eggplant and cream sauce is a very rich dish. I would recommend going with either the scallops, risotto, or short ribs.

The service here isn&#39;t pretentious, but they do aim to please.

Sugar Toad is great restaurant to have for a taste of the City."

Without a doubt Sugar Toad is the zenith of dining in Naperville and surrounding communities.  I can&#39;t think of any other restaurant that has this level of  high quality food on the menu.  My wife said, this is like dining in the city without the drive.  

We had the little gem salad, diver scallops, risotto &amp; bread pudding.

Every dish was full of flavor.  The ingredients were high quality and complimented each other perfectly.  

The wine list is extensive and we had a wonderful Malbec.

Took my sister here for her birthday and food was awful. Expensive and totally not worth the trip to naperville. My sister had the diver scallops and that was delicious. I had the risotto and it was just too mushy for them to call it risotto. It had no flavor, needed to add salt on my own. Maybe I should give it another try for drinks since this trip I did not have any drinks. 

The waitress was attentive, the atmosphere was nice and ambience-y. I read some good reviews for this place. Maybe I came on a wrong night. I will give this place another try another day."

Issues at both the front of the house and in the kitchen. I&#39;ll start with the fact that it is a small restaurant connected to a lounge. The whole place needs to be scrubbed down. Not dirty enough to freak you out but enough to notice. The servers don&#39;t have a clue. They try to pull it off like it&#39;s fine dining until you ask them a simple question about an ingredient or inform them of a food allergy. Then they start stuttering and now you&#39;re the enemy. Been there a few times and had a server tell me that ice cream and sorbet all are the same. What? Okay on the food - they do use fresh ingredients and their proteins are high quality. Flavors are interesting and I&#39;ll leave it at that - again inexperience in the kitchen comes shining through. Could be a cool spot if they got the right chef, trained the front of the house staff, and scubbed the place down."

The peppercorn butter that accompanied it was a bit salty, but that was the only flaw in the meal.  All of the flavors blended together wonderfully and the drink list was extensive. I had a glass of a Riesling that I&#39;ve never had before and the pour was generous. I had the porkchop with red onion jam, dried cherry sauce and the thyme infused polenta cake. The flavors were amzing. Just a well thought out, beautifully presented and wonderfully tasting dish. For dessert, was the most amazing bread pudding I have ever had. I may dream about it at night.

We had the pork belly appetizer which was decent.  She ordered the pork chop and the polenta on the side was cold by the time we got our food.  I ordered the surf and turf, with the surf being lobster paella.  I have to say the lobster paella was very gamey tasting, and I don&#39;t think serving it in the lobster tail shell helps it at all.  My filet was done well, and I enjoyed that.  Like I said, I really wanted to like it, but I&#39;m afraid that I didn&#39;t experience enough good food to come back and pay those prices again.

I bought the Groupon and the Dude and I excitedly set out for SugarToad last Saturday morning. 

Based on the reviews, I expected a fun, edgy, playful culinary experience. What I got was a standard hotel restaurant with steep prices and so-so food. I left wondering if the restaurant owner was friends with the restaurant reviewer at Chicago Magazine. I couldn&#39;t see any other possible way that it earned its glowing review.

The restaurant itself is quite small, with maybe 12 tables. When we arrived, the table right inside the restaurant was occupied by a group of three women and one screaming baby. The women seemed to think the baby&#39;s screeching was adorable and kept waving a stuffed animal in front of her face, prompting her to keep howling. Seriously? This went on the whole time we were there. 

For a brunch menu that touted itself as &#34;So Not Suburban,&#34; there really wasn&#39;t a lot of excitement on there. I ordered the eggs benedict and the Dude got a portabella sandwich. He scarfed his meal down, but mine was just so-so. The eggs benedict could only be described as standard and were definitely overpriced at $13. Our food took forever to arrive and my home fries were cold when they were set down in front of me. There were only four tables occupied in the whole restaurant. Why the heck was my food cold? 

To be fair, the glowing review was for dinner, not brunch. I just figured that a place that got such glowing reviews in the evenings wouldn&#39;t just be phoning it in during brunch. I was wrong."

They had a holiday 3-course prix fixe menu going for $45 pp, and not their regular menu.  I misunderstood in a pre-dinner phone query and thought that the prix fixe was a menu adder to their regular offerings, but it was all they had this evening.  Overall, the food quality was ok, but overpriced for what we got.  We had beet/pear salad, American Kobe short rib, and bread pudding for the prix fixe.  Son had the same except broccoli rissoto instead of the salad.  The rissoto had to be returned as it was too crunchy.  The short rib was tender but in the ok to bland range depending on your palate.  Their renowned brioche bread was warm, fresh, soft, and like a light loaf bread in texture.   Overall, a somewhat disappointing outing, and we&#39;ll have to return someday to try their normal menu."

I went with my mom and we shared the dishes because we weren&#39;t that hungry. We noticed that the server gave another table bread and butter so we were expecting to get some, too. He didn&#39;t give it to us and we had to ask for it. I will give him the benefit of the doubt and say he forgot.

For an appetizer, I ordered the corn soup that everyone was raving about. It tastes like any other corn soup..straight out of the can.

I ordered the arborio risotto as the main course and it was good. I have a salty palette so if you enjoy your food with less salt, you will enjoy this dish. It definitely has a unique taste to it. The braised oxtail was overcooked but they only give you a spoonful of braised oxtail to top off the dish.

For dessert I had the chocolate croissant bread pudding. It was okay. They give you a very small portion for a dessert that costs $11. I enjoyed the mini scoop of white chocolate ice cream on top more than the dessert as a whole."

I live in Chicago but spend some weekends in the burbs with my boyfriend.  After creeping the menus in the area, I decided I wanted to try this place simply for the Arborio Risoto.  I made early Saturday night reservations for the day after Valentines day. 5:30 is early, but given how crowded the restaurants can get in the area, I was surprised that it was just us and a few others there for almost an hour.  The restaurant isn&#39;t very big and you can&#39;t see it from the street. Not sure how people even know about it outside of the Yelp reviews.

We parked on the street but there&#39;s also a parking garage. Enter through the hotel.  A nice door man greeted us. They sat us by the window which I was pleasantly surprised to learn wasn&#39;t drafty at all... I always worry about this because I get cold easily.

They brought out bread and unsalted butter topped with lava salt which was really tasty.  The arborio risoto mostly lived up to the hype. For whatever reason, my first bite didn&#39;t have much flavor. Occasional bites didn&#39;t have flavor it was kind of weird. BUT as a whole, it was delicious.  The oxtail as part of the risoto dish was fantastic.  I could tell there was a lot of truffle oil in mine but I&#39;m not complaining. I&#39;m truffle oil obsessed. It all tasted very good as leftovers too.  My boyfriend had a chicken dish with a side of kale and potatoes. He liked the kale/potatoes combo. The chicken was good but not amazing. The portions for both were pretty big which was a pleasant surprise.  I love having leftovers.

Would I go here again? Yes.  I see that they do takeout.. probably because of the hotel. I might actually be inclined to get the risoto as takeout."

Once again.... it&#39;s about price point. Yes, it&#39;s a very posh, contemporary decorated dining room in a posh, contemporary hotel. The waitstaff are all very polite.  But to charge $12 for two eggs, two pieces of bacon, some potatoes and toast? Nope. Also to charge $12 for one mimosa? Nope.

Now I didn&#39;t order the mimosa, my wife did, so her breakfast was $24 (yes her fault for ordering a $12 mimosa). I went with a lunch option, the Chicken Banh Mi sandwich. It was pretty good, at $13 a bit pricey, but I&#39;d order it again if I wanted something different. The diet coke I ordered was $4 for some reason.

Sooo breakfast with tip was over $50. It simply isn&#39;t worth it.  There seems to be some great reviews of this spot for dinner, so maybe that&#39;s the time to go. But unless you like to way overpay for your breakfast, I&#39;d go somewhere else. If we stay at this hotel again, we&#39;ll be going out for breakfast in the morning."

The decor was nice, chairs are super comfortable, the dining area was smaller and more intimate than i expected and i didn&#39;t feel too close to anyone around us. Service was prompt and friendly. I had made a reservation with openTable and let them know that it was my husband&#39;s birthday. So a nice touch was that we got a  special menu that had &#39;happy birthday&#39; across the top, they offered us a sparkling toast (alcoholic or non). 

my husband&#39;s food was really great. he got the fois gras, &amp; oxtail risotto (which was so good i wished i had gotten that). our amuse bouche was also really great, it was a tempura sugar toad(puffer fish). 

my food on the other hand was disappointing. I ordered the mussels and the coconut sauce they were in was bland , the mussels were quite large but overall the dish was not anything special. my main course was the duck and it came as a whole breast that i had to ask for a steak knife to cut. any fine dining restaurant should pre-slice the duck breast for you, the fat was also not rendered well and just sat as a thick hard to cut slab on top. The breast itself was way overcooked. it should be rare to medium rare and it was almost well done. I only ate about half of it after growing tired of sawing through it with the steak knife. I know the skin/fat is hard to cut but again, this is why the kitchen should do it for you.

we didn&#39;t want to order dessert here as nothing caught our eye. so we left after our main course. 

i expected something a bit more spectacular from a place whose chef worked at French Laundry. I would imagine if you only ordered the burger or risotto you&#39;d be safe."

I had high hopes, but not fulfilled. We ate lunch in the bar which was pretty good overall nice spin on the Cobb salad. We were staying at the Aristas  for New Years and booked the price fix dinner. It all looked good on paper. 
We arrived for our reservation on time and the hostess did not seem prepared when I gave my name. The maître de asked and I told him, still no response from the hostess and she had to be told where to seat us. Ok. We were presented two menus after expecting only the price fix and told that we could order off either but we both had to order off the same. Ok, I was hoping for minimal decisions, so we opted for price fix and made our choices. The food was ok and there was lots of it. My steak had little flavor and my wife&#39;s risotto looked to be mostly rice with little other ingredients. My desert was very tasty but overall the food was pretty lacking. The waitress seemed to disappear at times and I finally waived someone else down to refill my wife&#39;s wine glass. 
Not a cheap meal but I have had worse and spent more. Would I come back? Not sure. It was New Years but they were not that busy. Again, I had high hopes but don&#39;t see what all the raves are about. Maybe it is the typical suburban angle and we are all just starved for a city level restaurant.

The following list is of the highlights and lowlights of the &#34;Not-So-Suburban Lunch&#34;:

+ Sweet, homemade jam with natural bites of fruit like blackberry and raspberry
+ Tons of smoked salmon on the eggs Benedict
+ Tender chunks of short rib in the hash
+ Good-sized portions overall with an awesome deal off of Groupon = a steal

- Cheesy mural that depicts a &#34;historic&#34; scene in the restaurant on the accent wall
- Asked for over-medium eggs and def got them as more well done and not as yolky
- Eggs Benedict needed some freshness like spinach or other veggies
- Hash would have been healthier, more flavorful and interesting with sweet potato instead of the usual potato

The reception itself was fantastic, but we could not have had a worse experience at SugarToad.

We showed up at about 12:30am, a full hour and a half before closing, with 11 people (the bride and groom included). Most of us were a little tipsy, but also pretty tired from a long day - no one was drunk or loud. There were two bartenders who were doing nothing, as there were literally no other customers there. Both bartenders gave us the look that someone who didn&#39;t care about customer service would give a group of belligerent drunks who walked into a bar 5 minutes before closing.

As soon as we attempted to order drinks, the bartender scowled and told us that &#34;the system is down&#34; and we couldn&#39;t order anything other than domestics and well liquor. First of all, she didn&#39;t tell us this apologetically. She told us in a short and angry tone, as though we should already know. Secondly, that&#39;s very weird and she gave no details on what &#34;the system is down&#34; actually meant and why that meant we could only order domestics and well liquor.

Whenever we ordered drinks, the bartenders acted pouty about it, as though we were asking them for too many favors. Seriously? We&#39;re paying you to do your jobs.

I had a good time here because I&#39;m not going to let some whiny bartenders ruin my evening, but if I was shocked at how rudely they treated someone who had just spent thousands upon thousands of dollars at this hotel. If I was their manager and I had seen how they were acting, they would be out the door in a heartbeat."

On a recent visit four of us ordered four different entrees.  I looked around the table and noticed how similar they all appeared -- pale meats with pale greenish &amp; white vegetables or starches.  Plating could be punched up a notch.  Flavors were a little bland as well.  On the plus side, the chef uses local (at least U.S.) and fresh ingredients.

We enjoyed trying a few of the home-made cold meats and cheeses, accompanied by pickled veggies and bread crisps - very good.

I did not care for the ants on a log dessert.  It consisted of a heavy, doughy small muffin (think fruit cake), on a thick pool of super-sweet peanut-buttery cream/frosting/mousse(?).  The &#34;ants&#34; (little dried fruits) were drowning in the same pool.  Try the mango brulee instead.

I will start by saying that this would have been a three-star review if not for the terrible hostess who greeted us at the door. She did nothing but start our meal off on a note of unwarranted negativity. (We were a few minutes late for our 7 p.m. reservation and said so, apologetically. She was *remarkably* rude, replying snottily and pretending there weren&#39;t any tables available, etc.)

My overall impression of SugarToad is that this is a good restaurant that thinks it&#39;s great. It&#39;s not. The food is competently prepared but is in no way extraordinary. The service was lackluster and kind of slow. (On several occasions, the waitstaff forgot which courses had been already delivered to which tables. For example, our intermezzo was mistakenly dropped off at another table before being brought to us. That&#39;s kind of tacky.)

I&#39;ll get back to the food, though. There was a special prix fixe menu for Valentine&#39;s Day, starting off with an amuse bouche of battered puffer fish (the &#34;sugar toad&#34;), which was actually really good. (One of the waitresses told us that this was a special treat from the chef just for Valentine&#39;s Day. Was it that obvious that we weren&#39;t &#34;regulars?&#34; A waiter delivered it to the table next to us while saying, &#34;Since you&#39;ve dined with us before, you know all about the sugar toad, right?&#34;) 

Anyway, the 1st course, duck consommé, was just okay. The smoked duck bits were yummy; that&#39;s about it. The 2nd course of seared scallops was delicious. Ok, the bed of risotto was forgettable, but the scallops were perfect! I would have been happy to make an entrée out of those.

Speaking of entrées... that came next. I had the Carolina triggerfish and my fiancé had the heart of ribeye. Ribeye is not a cut either of us are familiar with and it was served medium, so I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the restaurant&#39;s fault that it was drier and tougher than we are used to. The sauce served with the steak was really flavorful, though there should have been more of it, and the cornbread cakes were dry and hard. Meanwhile, my fish was very mild and perfectly-cooked; it was just kind of a bland dish, like every other mild, well-prepared fish I&#39;ve ever eaten.

Next up was the intermezzo, a mini pineapple upside-down cake with &#34;Mary Pickford&#34; sorbet. I liked the sorbet but the cake was REALLY dry. Same with our final course, the &#34;chocolate tasting for two.&#34; There was a butterscotch chocolate cake that could have been amazing but instead was just dry and bland. Supposedly the pile of crumbs strewn inelegantly on the plate next to this cake was some kind of &#34;white chocolate crumble&#34; but it tasted like burnt pie crust to me.

This meal was NOT worth $150+. I wish that SugarToad could be an awesome suburban restaurant with amazing food and great service, but it&#39;s just not. IThe menu is really not that inventive and the food is forgettable. Next time, I&#39;m just going to have to accept defeat and head to Chicago."

The place is adequate, with a nice decor- we were surprised how empty it was at 8:00 on a Saturday night, as not even half the tables were occupied.

We had the pork belly appetizer (adequate) and salad (VERY ordinary), followed by the Ono (good, but nothing special), and the oxtail risotto (Very good, and the only dish worth going back for).  

The staff at the place was very friendly and they had a good wine list.  However, given the price and other selections in the area, including City Gate which is across the parking lot,  we will not be returning"

I was thrilled with the opportunity, because it&#39;s been on my radar for some time.

The restaurant is visually stunning, and the focus on detail is very apparent; from the outstanding service to the appealing food presentation, it&#39;s all here.
The only fault I would mention is the fact that the menu is a tad unconventional, and slightly confusing.  For example, we weren&#39;t certain as to the identity of the entree course, the salad course, and the main course, etc. In the end, we decided to order whatever sounded appealing. 
Actually, everything sounded appealing, and if budget and waistline weren&#39;t issues, I would have ordered everything on the menu.

It started with a few Lagunitas Hairy Eyeball- man that stuff rocks- and ended with carrot cake with cheese cake ice cream.  It was the best carrot cake I&#39;ve ever had, and I&#39;ve had a lot of carrot cake.

In between were a divine beet salad and an outstanding duck with black kale.
The duck had an incredible smokey flavor- not overwhelming, just a hint to add a layer of flavor that I hadn&#39;t anticipated-it was awesome.

Dine here with confidence!"

After living in New York City for the last 8 years, and my lady for over 13, we were accustomed to eating at some of the finest establishments anywhere.  To say that our views on most of the local dining establishments were going to be slanted...and have some stiff competition.  I wanted to find someplace nice and local that offered fine dining and, surprise surprise, Sugar Toad nailed it!

We both opted for the prix-fixe 4-course dinner.  Naturally starting off on the right foot we got wine (which was US based and tasty) and one insane blackberry cocktail that was hardly sweet but did show off some wonderful infused blackberry alcohol.  First up was an eponymously named amuse bouche....very tasty to say the least.  I would have liked a bit less of the tempura batter so the pufferfish stood out more but this was a solid start to the meal.

First course was dungeness crab &#34;cake&#34; topped with a small dollop of artic char roe.  The crab was cooked to perfection, the roe adding in a nice bit of ocean pop.  A small bit of some sort of acid would have elevated the dish but another winner none the less.

Second course...zowie.  Foraged Mushroom Soup with Smoked Mushroom Crema and a flash-fried whole egg.  This bowl of wonder was visually pleasing...smelled wonderful...then once we broke the egg and mixed in the yolk it was all over!  The soup base was rich and flavorful, a bit of earthy goodness spotlighting the mushrooms.  Smoked Creama boosted the richness and paired nicely with the headier mushrooms...then the yolk of the fried egg thickened it up a bit and blasted this into thumbs-up territory. I believe this is on the normal menu and is a must-order!

This could have easily ended the meal, but the next thing we were treated to was some pillowy house-made brioche.  I make brioche, we&#39;ve had a ton of brioche in NYC and this was a really tasty bread.  

Third course was the main course - I had the beef, butternut squash and roasted brussel sprouts while my lady had the rainbow runner over some of the best gnocchi we&#39;ve had this side of Batali&#39;s Babbo.

Dessert....man, after that did we really have room for the last course?  Naturally!  We both had the silky Panna Cotta that had a S&#39;more sauce.  Right...sounds a bit odd but this was killer!  Save room for this.  

Service was fantastic, nice atmosphere especially if you were looking for a restaurant that is above average on their offerings.  We can&#39;t wait to go back!"

I wish Yelp would allow fractions, because I&#39;d really put this place at about 3.5 or 3.75.  Not quite a four, but I&#39;m not making it a 3 because it&#39;s better than that.
My wife and I had the exact same impression of this restaurant.  If you&#39;ve ever been to an all-inclusive resort in Mexico or the Caribbean, Sugar Toad feels like a nice restaurant in an all-inclusive.  If you haven&#39;t been to one, my apologies because that makes no sense to you at all.  In short, it&#39;s nice, the food is decent and the drink list is extensive.  But, it doesn&#39;t feel exceptional.

The Bar
We arrived early because we wanted to check out the bar.  The bar is nothing great.  Not huge, but on a Saturday night, it wasn&#39;t busy, so we were happy with not feeling crowded.  It has a fine mixed drink list , lots of wine and small brewery bottled beer.  I hope they&#39;re paying Julius, the bartender, a great wage because he&#39;s the reason I didn&#39;t make this a 3 star.  This guy knows his stuff.  He was really friendly and recommended to my wife one of the best mixed drinks i&#39;d had in a long time.  It&#39;s called a &#34;Honey Bear&#34; because, well, it tastes like honey.  It&#39;s an ideal sweet spring/summer drink.  

The Restaurant
I was jonesing for a burger.  Not sure why, but I had to have a burger.  This place does an adequate burger and at about $15, I didn&#39;t feel cheated.  They cooked it properly at medium well which tells me they know how to cook meat.  A solid burger with a little pink is harder than you&#39;d think.  They threw on some bacon, cheese, tomatoes, pickles...mmm-mmmm tasty.  
My wife had the scallops at about $33.  My wife loved it, but personally, at the price point, the dish deserved a little more than a bed of bulgar wheat.  Yeah, I didn&#39;t know what that was, either.  &#34;Bulgar&#34; sounds eastern European or something.  Essentially, it tasted like couscous.  It was alright.  The scallops were on the money.  If you haven&#39;t had scallops before but were curious, this is a great one to try for your first time out.  If you&#39;re scared of trying them, don&#39;t be.  They taste a little like lump crab meat.  Good stuff, even if a tad overpriced.
For dessert, we had the bread pudding.  Yeah, this is a dessert.  Cinnamon, apricots, carmel.  Totally worth it.

The Bill
We had a couple of glasses of wine each at $14 a pop.  Total check before tip for two was about $135.  Not too bad.  They&#39;re going for fine dining and that&#39;s the going rate, i&#39;d say.  

Biggest Issue
The biggest problem was that the restaurant service, to me, was off.  This place was maybe two thirds full and the guy we had disappeared for long stretches to the point where I kept wondering why.  Is there some party in the back?  Is he the chef?  Maybe it was just one of those things, but if you&#39;re trying to be fine dining and charge those prices, I&#39;m going to hold you to those standards.  It just didn&#39;t measure up, I&#39;m sorry to say.  The weird thing was that on OpenTable, they had no 7:30 reservations available.  I called the restaurant and took an 8pm.  We got there at 7 and the place had one table filled out of about 13.  By 8pm, there was probably 6 of 13 full tables.  By 9:30, there were still a few open tables.  So why does OpenTable have no 7:30 reservations?  Is this a marketing thing to make it seem in demand?  I was puzzled.  Perplexed, even.

Overall
I&#39;ll probably come back, but it&#39;ll be to hang out in the bar.  I just didn&#39;t find the final food bill to fit the experience.  They&#39;re trying, i&#39;ll give them that, but when I&#39;m paying, I don&#39;t want to be your experiment.  Just make sure to visit Julius and tip well.  The guy deserves it.

Edit: Somebody previously mentioned the weird mix of music.  Totally!  At one point, you could kind of hear something, then a moment later, I think I heard Bon Jovi or something playing kinda loud."

It was perfect for the hubs and I for our anniversary dinner. So let&#39;s get to it, shall we?

The good- 
Lovely atmosphere. Very swanky and easy to compare to some lounges downtown. Small but intimate, not cramped.
Extensive wine list. Plenty to choose from and even had my favorite german riesling that is hard to find outside of calling Binnys to place an order for you.
Hardy food portions and well paced meal. Service was just fine. Not out of this world, but not terrible by any means.
Bread was scrumptious (even though hubs thought they would replenish automatically, when it appears you must ask for a second slice).
The Little Gem salad was the highlight (for me anyways). Full of flavor and tons of goat cheese. Nothing was skimped on this one.
Oxtail risotto was wonderful. Full of flavor and plentiful. Could be a tad bit creamier, but that really is the only negative.
Pork chop with the charred cauliflower was a good dish but the brussel sprouts were VERY salty. Like salt lick salty. Drank an entire glass of water after first bite. 
The water is left on the table in adorable square carafes. I wanted one for my kitchen.

The bad-
The reservation we had was placed for the wrong day. The host gave us the &#34;ehh...we don&#39;t have you but we can seat you anyway&#34; schpeel. He did later apologize and explained the reso got mixed up.
Music selection was all over the board. We sat down to the theme song to Friends (??) and left to Mumford and Sons. A small thing, but still...it&#39;s weird to take one bite to Sinatra and then the next to Dawsons Creek.
They were out of sugartoad tempura so we did not receive it as our amuse bouche. Instead, we were given the foie gras which, for ethical reasons, I will not eat so I missed out. Not something that is a point against them, just a downer.
The cappuccino was all foam. Hardly any coffee whatsoever. Hard to justify paying $4.50 for milk.

Overall, very impressed and had a lovely time. Probably wouldn&#39;t make this an every week eatery, but definitely something to consider for special occasions. If you catch a Groupon for this one, I highly recommend you snag it. I will make the difference in order just one cocktail or having an entire bottle of wine."

And by &#39;on a whim&#39; I guess I really mean making decisions after drinking a bottle of wine. That being said, I am glad I decided to take my wife to sugartoad for her birthday. The vibe at this place is good. You do get a certain amount of &#39;hotel&#39; clientele, but it seems that the chef/owner is striving to make the place more of a destination. The music was good, and the decor was nice. 

The service, as others have stated was excellent, and the pacing of the meal was right-on. Over a cheese plate, bread, entree, and then coffee and dessert, about 2 hrs passed. This was great as we were not in any hurry, and the servers sensed this. The food itself was excellent, and once again provided a glimpse into the chef&#39;s vision. My entree of Veal shoulder, sous-vide, was tender and flavorful. Served with white beans and broccoli, the portion was perfect sized. I do not want nor need to be wowed by the massive portions at a restaurant, I would rather finish my meal completely and feel satisfied, not as if I need to be rolled out of the place on a gurney. 

Dessert was awesome. I had &#39;ants on a log&#39;- a piece of celery root cake with peanut butter mouse and rum raisin ice cream. tremendous and thoughtful. 

All in all, a great meal. Trends toward spendy, but we all live in Naperville, so that makes us rich anyway, right?"

Sugar Toad however has the appeal and draw of a restaurant located in the heart of a city.

To start off your meal they bring out a bite of &#34;sugar toad.&#34; It&#39;s a small tempura bite of the puffer fish that the restaurant is named after.

This restaurant locate in the hidden plaza called City Gate, I think not so many people would know that since this plaza got almost empty, they built this plaza for 1 or 2 years but not so many office moved it and I guess really not so many people aware of it.  I knew there is a restaurant there but never tried it, since I&#39;m pretty feel bored of downtown Naperville restaurant, I really want to try something new but close to my home, so I made a try tonight and I think I made a right decision.

Upscale atmosphere located in the hotel Arista, not a big restaurant but served a very decent food, I have to say they served a good bread, fresh baked bread and I like the way they serve it, put it to the pocket napkin and they have a bread server give it to you, so classy! Waitress was so good, she got a good acknowledge of their menu and the chef gave us a small bite of fish as starter, tasty!

Minus one star for being incredibly slow (hence the googling - no server to ask)!  Cheese and soup should not take an hour.  They&#39;re not even that busy.  Guess they thought I&#39;d love to hang out by myself in a restaurant on a Monday night.  Wait a minute...."

As soon as we sat at our table I knew this was going to be a great dining experience.  From the menu freshly printed with a &#34;Happy Birthday&#34; message to the wonderful table they reserved for us in the back of the restaurant for my privacy as requested by my wife at the time of reservation.  

Really one of the biggest pluses for this restaurant was the wonderful customer service and attentiveness by the management and wait staff.   There was quite a bit of teamwork on the staff which made it so that there was always someone attending to our needs throughout the night.

As for the menu:  We debated for quite a while as to whether to go with the Chef&#39;s 5 course tasting menu, but decided against it because there were a few things on the menu that we definitely wanted to try. Though we will definitely be going back to try the 5 course as well as something they call the Total Experience (all the course you can eat during the weekday).

We decided to go A la carte:

Appetizers:   Instead of the usual soup or salad starter we decided to go with a selection of meats and cheeses out of their wide choices.  The selection came on a wooden board with crostini and toppings. We went with the Saucisson (Pepper Sausage), Sopresatta (Red Wine Sausage), a Billy Blue Cheese, and the Widmer Wisconsin cheddar.  All very good and filling.

For our main course:  My wife went with the Hangar Stake that was accompanied by Spinach and Butternut squash sauce.  Very tasty, flavorful and moist piece of beef.  I was debating between the Yellowfin Tuna and the Veal Shoulder and decided to go with the veal.  A very moist and tender piece of veal with broccoli, capers, and lemon.  

For Dessert: All the homemade dessert looked very appetizing but we decided to go with a Pear Crumble/Crisp with Granola and Vanilla Bean Ice Creak ( a nice twist instead of the usual Apple Crisp) and we also went with a Mango Brulee with White Chocolate Sorbet and Raspberry sauce. Both dessert were excellent.

The wine list was extensive and the choice of unique hand crafted beers was great (I went with the Three Floyd&#39;s Pride and Joy).

Overall:  a great birthday dinner that has us thinking about what we are going to eat next time we visit this restaurant and it&#39;s unique cuisine."
sugartoad-naperville-2,apricotica l.,1sXTEvxkNxMCE9vAR-Scpg,"San Jose, CA",0,1,0,0,917,NFWiMJj8uisLzbyVSZqRMA,1.0,2012-07-12,"Sugar Toad professes to be a fine dining restaurant attached to the Arista hotel in Naperville, IL.  And while it is attached to the hotel, fine dining was most certainly not had there during my recent stay.  In fact, the restaurant was god-awful.  This review is based on three unfortunate meals I suffered there, and if inclement weather and optimism (maybe they were just having an off day?) hadn&#39;t made it seem a viable source for food I most certainly wouldn&#39;t have returned after the first horrible breakfast.

Breakfast is offered either buffet style ($19.99 for all you can eat) or ala carte from the menu.  Since twenty bucks is outrageous for a breakfast buffet, I opted to order from the menu.  I ordered a regular coffee and the Greek yogurt with blueberries and walnuts.  I was brought and charged extra for a large French press coffee and a bowl of warm, curdled yogurt that most definitely was not Greek style, topped with a meager smattering of berries and nuts.  The nuts tasted rancid and old.  I ate them because I was starving and left the yogurt in the bowl.  Service was slow despite the fact that there were only 3 other customers.  That meal ended up costing $21.

The next morning I again forwent the buffet, although I noticed that it was set up without regard to health code mandates governing the service of buffets (I used to work as a cook in a ritzy health club), and I secretly pitied anyone foolhardy enough to fill up on those over-priced offerings left sitting around uncovered at room temperature for hours.  This time I actually got the regular coffee I asked for rather than the here-let-us-gouge-you-some-more French press.  I ordered an eggless, meatless version of a breakfast sandwich for $12, and received a tiny Thomas&#39;s English muffin piled with wilted spinach, mild cheddar, and diced tomatoes as well as a side of potatoes that were billed as home fries but had clearly been cooked in a deep fryer and resembled French fries more than anything else.  I&#39;ve had better potatoes at Denny&#39;s.  The spinach on my sandwich tasted faintly of mildew, and it soaked through the muffin turning it into mush.  It was gross.  Moreover, my drinking water had flecks of brownish orange stuff floating in it.  Service was again slow and inattentive.  I resolved to skip breakfast at Sugar Toad from that point on.

The next day my lunch plans were foiled by a violent storm, so I again sought sustenance at Sugar Toad.  Again, I ordered regular coffee and was given (and charged for) pricey French press.  Service was unbelievably slow although there was only one other table and it was occupied by just two customers.  It took 40 minutes for the server to bring my order, and when it arrived I was bitterly disappointed:  what should have been flat bread, warm and crispy-chewy, topped with arugula pesto, grape tomatoes, cheese and vegetables was, instead, four large crackers, cold and stale, smeared with an unpleasant green slime and carelessly dotted with a few slices of mushroom, a couple tiny cubes of zucchini, some halved cherry tomatoes and three globs of odd-tasting goat cheese.  As with previous meals, I wouldn&#39;t have eaten it if I hadn&#39;t been starving.  And after this last meal I felt ill for the next eight hours and had to stay up in my room instead of enjoying my last full day of vacation.

After checkout, while I was at the airport, I got an email from the hotel asking me to comment on aspects of my stay.  I let them know of my immense dissatisfaction with the restaurant and, a couple days later, I received an email from the food and beverage director of the hotel apologizing for my bad experience at Sugar Toad and offering me a gift certificate good for dinner for two.  Although I have no immediate plans to return to Naperville, I accepted the offer.  And then never heard another word back.  No response,  no .PDF gift certificate, no request for a mailing address to send a paper copy of one. Nothing.  So I can say, without hesitation, that Sugar Toad is a terrible restaurant run terribly by careless and incompetent people, and if you&#39;re looking for a nice restaurant in Naperville, AVOID SUGAR TOAD LIKE THE PLAGUE."

And I&#39;ll say in advance, I don&#39;t know what, but I just...can&#39;t give four stars here. 

Four of us ate here recently, for a birthday. The amuse bouche was a tempura sugar toad, which was tasty, but then, what&#39;s not tasty when you fry it. My appetizer was faro risotto with roasted grapes and artichokes. The grapes and artichokes were good, but the faro was just faro. Of course, I was sucked in by the word &#34;risotto,&#34; but there wasn&#39;t much risotto-y about this. No major points off, I knew what I was getting in to. But it lacked that creamy al dente texture that is what I love so much about risotto. Others had some of the best gnocci I&#39;ve had - perfectly, and I do mean perfectly cooked, and some nice veal sweetbreads with carrot puree. We also tried a couple cheeses and some charcutterie items - their pate is delicious, the corned beef is listed as a confit, but is just really nice lean corned beef, and the cheeses we had (all domestic, one goat and one Camembert) were also pretty good, the Camembert especially. 

My entree was a smoked trout and vegetable dish - the veggies were heirloom tomatoes, celery, and fennel. The tomatoes were good, if not a little soft, and the trout was nice and smoky, if not particularly flavorful. The winner of the group was a veal...something. Veal shoulder, perhaps? It was awesome - tender and juicy, served on top of delicious buttery grits, and with a side of a sort of salted date creation. The three went together so amazingly well. 

It was a school night, so we boogied without sampling desert - even though that had a fine sounding bread pudding, and some other pretty good looking items besides.

I want this to be better than four stars, I really do. The menu is fairly creative, and things were good. This is maybe the strongest 3 star it could possibly be, but something is just missing here. Maybe if I&#39;m ever back, I&#39;ll get a better vibe. But I&#39;m at a loss to explain it. I know, that&#39;s completely unhelpful."

We stopped in here during the annual Naperville Wine Festival that is held across the street.  Always thought the place would be packed.  It was not.....actually it was almost empty.  However.....so glad we had dinner here.  Our starters were the seared tuna and braised pork belly.  The braised pork belly as awesome and a lick the bowl kind of dish.  The seared tuna just OK, which in my book is not good enough and wouldn&#39;t order again.  Entrees were the short ribs and oxtail risotto.  The oxtail risotto was to die for!  it has a lobster sauce and truffle oil and each and every bite was absolutely delicious.  We ate every bite and would go again just for this dish.  Might I add that my sister is gluten free so the chef accommodated that with all of our dishes and everything was still great!.
Only thing they could do better on is service.  Since we eat at a lot of top end restaurants we know what good service is all about.  Servers should be able to tell you what the best dishes are and why and should fill your water and wine glasses.  Neither of these were done at a grade level of anything higher than a &#34;C&#34;.  Since they are attached to such a high end hotel, you would expect and deserve better service than that."

Cool little place with a southern inspired comfort food flair. We went for our anniversary and had the four course dinner which was pretty delish. Especially the pork trio which was divine savory goodness. Wine list is domestic which also makes the place less pretentious. My only real gripe was our server didn&#39;t make the night special. The couple seated behind us were also celebrating their anniversary and their server was super fun and added to the celebration. Also, they were all pretty serious...doesn&#39;t hurt to crack a smile and look like you are having fun!"

5 reasons why SugarToad is worth the hike:
1.  The BEST bread I have ever had.
2. The Puffer Fish tasting is amazing...but you will want more.  I now see why they named the restaurant after it.
3. Get the Leg of Duck Confit.  Seriously, its an appetizer that you cant go wrong with.
4. The Crab Cakes are the best in the city.  True Story.
5. Lastly...the Soft Shell Crab.  The chief explains on the menu what makes them so good...whatever he did to catch and prepare them..he did right!

Oh wait,
6.  The menu changes every day.  What other dishes does the chief master?  I&#39;m going back to find out!"
sugartoad-naperville-2,Jason W.,-rnkQeusH_rTgXg0kEQK5Q,"Kalamazoo, MI",0,1,1,6,122,hbiQi-ASCV8r9QL-4pi_tg,2.0,2012-08-08,"We headed down for breakfast on a Sunday morning, were greeted by a male host, and he took us back to a table. I noticed seating was available outside and asked if we could be seated there. We were seated at a table with the sun directly in my eyes and without an umbrella. Had I know that this was the case, I would have not have made this request, but since I&#39;m not employed there, that was not knowledge that I had. Our server kindly moved us back inside, after remarking that I looked &#34;miserable&#34; as I squinted at the menu.

The menu was more diverse than your typical pancake house and had some interesting choices. I chose the egg white fritatta with goat cheese and my wife had some sort of eggs benedict. Her&#39;s was excellent, mine was mediocre. The hollandaise especially on the benedict stood out to me. Nicely made. The fritatta looked sort of a mess and seemed largely underseasoned. Luckily, the goat cheese added some much needed flavor to every bite... well, every bite from the point halfway through the meal where I realized I needed to add some of it to whatever I was putting in my mouth.

My meal was served with my choice of toast - I chose an english muffin. But there was nothing to accompany it. Do people really eat just a plain, toasted english muffin? Maybe they do. Not me. My request for a little butter was met, but really shouldn&#39;t have had to be made in the first place.

Toward the end of the meal, we saw the greeter (who was also acting as a server) meet another server at the door to the kitchen. She was carrying two plates of food, assumedly heading to one of the tables. He seemed to reprimand her, as she set the plates of food down on the bar, hung her head, and walked back into the kitchen.

Maybe it was this single employee&#39;s attitude, but it left us feeling like we were merely a nuisance rather than a guest. The food isn&#39;t pretentious, but the staff seems to be doing it&#39;s best to make up for it."

Below average food and portions (ah, Woody Allen) and service and expensive to boot!

The service was good, they used 6 waiters to deliver all entrees at the same time, but the wine guy felt compelled to listen/join in on our conversation.

I drank beer and was bit disappointed they didn&#39;t have Hacker Pshor, just Blue Moon, while everyone else drank wine. They did provide a complimentary appetizer, their &#34;famous&#34; crab cakes which were good.

Our party included a master chef, and his wife who is also a chef. Her comment was &#34;this guy knows how to cook&#34;. The menu was a bit limited, and I had the Kobe flat-iron steak. It was really interesting, I have had Kobe steaks before, but this cut was new to me. I liked it, but it was really different.

It was a long meal which was strange since there was only 1 other table, it was also on the expensive side, total bill with tip came in at $204.03. We had a couple of bottles of wine, several beers, salads, entree and desert.

Everyone else in our party of 6 really enjoyed the meal, while I thought it was better than average. I would return if I had to."

Great, classy ambiance (and it should be, for these prices in what I could swear is actually Warrenville). Unique cocktails.

We went for my mom&#39;s birthday and they gave us complimentary champagne toast. The oxtail risotto was everyone&#39;s favorite. Skip the pork chop. I considered giving them 4 stars because the server was slowish (also brought the wrong beer, forgot to wrap up my mom&#39;s leftovers), but I&#39;m giving her the benefit of the doubt and recommending this place wholeheartedly!

I have to admit by the time it got to the main course I was already stuffed, but it would have been rude to let the food go to waste.

So here we go:

The Wine:
I am by no means a wine expert so all I will say is that I didn&#39;t hear anyone at my table complain about the wine they had, including myself

The Selection:
Menus are printed daily and the ingredients shipped daily.   The selection is as many as you would get at other restaurants, but they are all appealing.  However, I will mention, you definitely have to be open to eating outside-of-the-box if you want to eat here.  

The Appetizers:
Never, never, never in my life did I think I would eat something call &#34;Cheeks and Leeks.&#34;  Intriguing isn&#39;t it!?  What is it you ask?  It is an appetizer that combines the cheeks of a groper fish, leeks and a lobster butter sauce.  Very  tasty!  

Also, to our surprise, we were also treated to a amuse-bouche of Sugar Toad compliments of the chef.  What we did to deserve that I&#39;m not sure, but I&#39;m not complaining.  Oh, and might I say, Sugar Toad is quiet good as well!

The Soup:
Along with the Sugar Toad and Cheeks and Leeks that floated around our table, I also got a bowl of their Wild Mushroom Soup with crispy leeks. 

Now, I will say ordering this soup was going out on a limb for me as I&#39;m not a huge fan of mushrooms.  However, this soup was so good!  I would definitely recommend it.

The Bread:
What would a meal be without bread?  Prior to our appetizers arriving we all got served a slice of their sweet, delicious bread. . . and don&#39;t worry that you only get one slice.  Water is not the only thing they replenish.


The Main Entree: 
Like I stated above, by the time we got to the main entree I was stuffed and could have stopped right then and there, but I didn&#39;t and am I glad I didn&#39;t. 

Choosing what to get was tough.  I  considered the Carolina Wreckfish and the Tripletail . . .  However, when it came down to it I was drawn to the &#34;Finally Famous&#34; Crabcakes.  These crabcakes were perfect!  Lightly sauteed and packed with flavor.  There was also a bit of pasta and pea pods to accompany the cakes.

And then of course, almost always last, but never least. . . 

Dessert:
Since we had had this fantastic meal it only made sense to finish off with some dessert.  

Like the appetizers, there were a few desserts floating around the table.  I only had bites of the Creme Burlee and Apple Tart.  Both were good, but didn&#39;t knock my socks off.  

Hey, you can&#39;t win &#39;em all, right!?

During this whole time there were two other factors to consider . . . .

The Service:
The service at Sugar Toad was fantastic.  There was never an empty water glass or a need/want unmet.  Very attentive, courteous and engaging.  

The Atmosphere:
Upscale modern is how I would describe the atmosphere.  

All in all, I would recommend Sugar Toad without any hesitation."
sugartoad-naperville-2,Gina Z.,2cw8wjACr7OR1gUxHzTREw,"Wheaton, IL",0,1,0,30,190,gE6_H2043K041bH8bFORYQ,1.0,2009-02-07,"We went there for dinner with 5 couples and had reservations. They gave us a speical menu with one salad and 3 entres on it. When we questioned it, it took 2 waiters, the resturant manager and the chef Jimmy Sneed to come out all equally aragant. Thank god no one has food allergies or health issues because Jimmy is the chef you eat what he wants to serve. Jimmy spent the time to tell us he needs to make sure everything comes out on time and it perfect.

Ok we stayed to see what the fuss is about.They bring out a assortment of soups, didnt ask, maybe we all would want the same one black bean, butternut squash and red pepper. For 5 minutes all 10 of us are passing soups to make sure we all like them. Waiter asks if we would like wine pairing. one waiter is taking orders for drinks one is bring wine pairing again, no communication. 

We have a lobster salad, the minute it was brought in front of me it smelled of fish. It was a wimpy loberter claw on top of what had looked like stems of celery cut off it was bitter and awful. We were served a peice (just one) of sweet bread I do not think your allowed to ask for more. Next were the big fuss crab cakes were ok at best, The scallops were actully tastey. Then we get our entree and many ordered the Kobe rib and it was 1 rib. We all ate kinda chuckled thinking we had never seen such small food.

Dessert I ordered the carrot cake and three small peices of carrot cake the size of a frango mint, it looked like something off of a diet plate.

Bottom line, over priced, snobby chef, atmosphere no biggie and I am just so over the small food thing. If jimmy ego would be as small as his portions on his menu he might realize Emeril Laggassee has a better recipe for crab cakes.

Go across the way to Riva, elegant resturant, fabulous food, and personal service."
sugartoad-naperville-2,Jesster A.,egYwrFDfbnV91ioNUZ8TAA,"Evanston, IL",0,1,0,93,49,nEr561PjIqwggZjv0qmzDQ,4.0,2008-09-27,"Disclaimer: We went there to fill-in for an invited guest/chef who was out of town - our dinner was part of a Pre-Opening  /  Rehearsal event.

This was the 4th and final day of their &#34;trial&#34; opening and the staff was very much up to snuff in terms of service* (*with one exception I&#39;ll get to later) and an excellent  knowledge of everything on the menu (and were quick and courteous to answer any truly obscure question!) 

First question: SUGAR TOAD? It&#39;s a type of Blowfish found off the east coast that is considered to be &#34;sweet as sugar and ugly as a toad.&#34;  If it sounds like a kind of &#34;southern&#34; name - that&#39;s probably because chef/owner, Jimmy Sneed is best known for his previous restaurant: &#34;Frog and the Redneck&#34; in Virginia. 

That said, the food is quite sophisticated and very very good.  While &#34;Sugar Toad&#34; itself is not on the menu it is served as an  &#34;amuse bouche&#34; and to our minds, was not very memorable. However, everything that followed was noteworthy.

We started with appetizers: a very well prepared dish of Sweetbreads (which I normally do not like!) and a lovely and luscious Lobster concoction that was lick the plate good.

The menu isn&#39;t huge and is diviided into LAND and SEA options. We opted for the Rotisserie Leg of Lamb Infused with Garlic and Rosemary, with sauteed Wild Mushrooms and  Jimmy&#39;s &#34;Finally Famous&#34; Jumbo Lump Crabcakes. Both were outstanding!  I mean truly succulent, perfectly prepared and utterly delicious. (And no, we have no invested interest in this place - but are grateful that the food was worth the drive...)

(We also saw and somewhat coveted the delicious looking Wagyu Bistro Tender (Kobe-like beef...) but were more than satisfied with our choices.)

Although, we were contently full, we couldn&#39;t resist trying a couple of desserts: a very creamy Creme Brulee and a good but nothing special Tapioca Pudding (we had to sample this classic childhood comfort food, like Mac and Cheese, just to see if it was better than we can make at home - it wasn&#39;t - but hey - considering the calibre of everything else - no big deal.)

They have a worthy wine list - though by the glass - the prices seemed to average about $12 a glass.  

*Now to the down side: we were kind of confused when we were seated in this small (a few tables)reception area just inside the front door - kind of like a &#34;dead-zone&#34; - while it sounded like a lively and energetic party was going on in the main dining area (see their website: www.sugartoad.com to get a sense of it) so we really did not get a sense of the decor, atmosphere and the ambience (it looked pretty nice, perhaps a bit noisy - though the food and service make up for it.)

Anyway, we learned why we were seated seperately from the main event, although we had RSVP&#39;d - they did not realize we were invited guests and thought we were just walk-ins (albeit walk-ins with a reservation. - since they greeted us by name when we walked - a bit late - we got lost in the maze...) We found this puzzling since we spent a fair amount of time chatting with the GM about the restaurant business etc.

And the way we found out - was when they presented the bill (causing a sudden rush of indigestion after a lovely if somewhat lonely/isolated dinner - we really didn&#39;t mind being seated far from &#34;the Maddning Crowd&#34;  - in fact it was kind of nice...) We explained that we thought we were there as invivted GUESTS. The crisis was quickly averted, except for the four $12 glasses of wine and the tip based on what the tab would have been...**

Still, except for the seemingly endless drive to get there, We enjoyed a lovely dinner with excellent service and an apparent misunderstanding that was quickly rectified.

Note: If you live in Evanston, add $50 to your tab to cover the price of gas to get there and back!

** Just a totally seperate Aside:

I know all you &#34;wise-asses&#34;  (just kidding! Really!) at YELP already know this: but when you get a &#34;freebie&#34; or &#34;Comp&#34; meal or a gift certificate to a restaurant - it does NOT cover / include the tip/gratuity!!! (And if you think the Minimum Wage is low - unless of course - you&#39;re the one PAYING it - the wage for restaurant waitstaff is like half as much (if that) and your tip is going to be split with managers, busboys, etc.

Once, in a weak moment (back when I was feeling a lot more flush) I gave a $75 gift certificate to a homeless couple I had befriended while volunteering at a Soup Kitchen to/for a restaurant  they could only dream of going to (I think it was a Michael Jordan or Harry Carey place) - I found out later that they brought  a friend and used up all but 37 cents of the $75 - and did NOT leave any tip (except for the 37 cents) and I was quite mortified. 

Even if you can&#39;t afford to be generous, at least always be fair!"

We decided to trust the chef so we were just so excited to taste every creation he made for the eight courses.

The meal, including drinks, was over $100. The couple at the table next to us had to call the GM over and he promptly returned their plates to the kitchen and reappeared with them several minutes later. At least we knew it wasn&#39;t just us having problems."

It&#39;s near our office, and we&#39;d been meaning to try it for a while (or as I&#39;ve said, &#34;Let&#39;s eat there before they close.&#34;) There&#39;s no indication that there&#39;s a restaurant here, and no real way to know there&#39;s even a hotel here unless you go around to the inside, between the office buildings. Word of mouth and no sign might work for Two Brothers Tap House in Warrenville, but unless this upscale restaurant does a much better business at supper than at lunch, I don&#39;t see how it will survive in this location.

We were seated near the very nice mural wall in the back. There were only three other tables seated the whole time we were there (noon to 1:00pm or so on a Friday). The waitress brought us each one slice of brioche and a carafe of &#34;Lake MIchigan&#39;s Finest&#34; (water). The brioche was tasty but the texture was a bit gummy. I usually can&#39;t stop with one slice of bread, but I didn&#39;t see a need to ask for more. I ordered the house special BLT, which comes with a fried egg. It was served on a nice sturdy white bread and was a perfectly acceptable BLT, if it had been $7.95 instead of $11.00 The french fries that came with it were a very dark brown and limp. They badly needed salt, but there was no salt on the table (only a pepper mill).  There was no salt on any of the other tables, either. I understand that a chef doesn&#39;t want diners to mindless season a dish he&#39;s prepared, but why allow pepper then? When I asked the waitress for salt, she brought some and told us that they don&#39;t put salt out because &#34;the chef likes to use a lot of salt.&#34; Okay . . .  but  fries need salt, and these weren&#39;t salted in the kitchen.

My friend ordered the famous crab cakes, which turned out to be one barely 3&#34; crab cake with a pasta side and glazed carrots, for $15.00. She said there was a lot of crab in the crabcake, and everything was very &#34;buttery.&#34;

The waitress and manager were very attentive, and I was only a little unnerved by the waitress repeatedly calling us &#34;Honey.&#34; I did like the quick service and the Eagles music. I might ask my husband to take me there for a special dinner and give it one more try, but I probably won&#39;t go back for lunch."

I had expected the bill to be pricey, but I also expected the food to wow me... it did not. We each had the 4 course option, picking 8 different items for both of us to share. The menu looked really enticing (foie gras with strawberry ice, vanilla, carbonated verjus... sounds super interesting right?) I was particularly excited for the lobster with watermelon, yogurt and long pepper... neither of these dishes tasted as good as they sound- they don&#39;t even taste INTERESTING (even if it was really weird, but bad, then I&#39;d just chalk it up to people&#39;s differing tastes). Every course that came out I was impressed by the presentation and description, but none of them tasted good. When we came to the last course-dessert- which is always my favorite and I&#39;m not too picky when it comes to sweets... I only liked 1 out of the 2. And I only liked it, nothing super special/awesome/interesting. This one and only dish I liked here and would recommend people ordering is the white chocolate molten lava cake with chocolate pot de creme and peanut butter toffee ice cream. I will say that my boyfriend liked a few more of the dishes than I did, but I kind of think he was trying to be nice since I was paying. I ended up taking him for a &#34;make-up&#34; birthday dinner to NEXT in Chicago which was 1 of the best meals we&#39;ve ever had. Super expensive but completely worth it. SugarToad is a very nice looking restaurant and I have no complaints about our service, in fact it was quite good (they even took a course back to the kitchen to keep it hot since when they served it my boyfriend was in the bathroom). But people come to a restaurant for the food over anything else, so with that said, I recommend trying other places before maybe eventually getting to this one."

We went here this morning (Sunday), at 9:15. It was busy!! We waited 20 minutes to be seated, no big deal. We were seated at a small table near the coffee bar, a bit too cold of a breeze coming from the front door constantly opening (next time I&#39;d wait for a better seat).

Our server was Rachel, she was awesome!! Despite being super busy, she was on top of her game....quick to bring out drinks, food, and predicted our needs (bringing condiments and such). I was even offered a to-go cup to take my coffee home, nice touch!!

On to the food....
I had The Goat omelette with crispy potatoes and a biscuit. The omelette was good, but not great. I&#39;ve had similar dishes elsewhere that were better. The sausage had a strong/odd flavor. But the crispy potatoes were PHENOMENAL! They were seasoned perfectly. The biscuit was good but dry. I definitely needed to use the butter and jam that accompanied it. 

Let me preface my husband&#39;s order by saying he usually complains that breakfast portions are too small (ala Egg Harbor and Nosh). Not here! He had the Corned Beef Brisket skillet which offered such a large portion he brought some home!! It had large chunks of brisket and as he stated &#34;was the best corner beef skillet he&#39;s ever had&#34;.

Finally, I regret not ordering a Bloody Mary. A neighboring table ordered one and it looked delicious."

Chicken n biscuits 11.99$ this was the worst chicken n biscuits dish i ever had the chicken was a lil greasy so it wasnt crispy. The chicken was really small so after a couple of bites ur left wanting more. The flavor of the chicken was really bland one of the worst fried chickens i ever had how could somebody mess up fried chicken. The biscuits were really hard n flavorless frozen biscuits would have been better then these. I love gravy but the gravy was really bland even sausage couldnt save the taste of this dish. Instead of house potatoes which i hate because their always old n flavorless which is how they are at his establishment i ordered fries. I loved the texture of the fries but they werent seasoned so that is dissapointing wouldnt order this again if it was free

Eggs your way with a side of pancakes 5.99$ the house potatoes were old n luke warm n they werent even that cripsy they werent seasoned so the only place they belong is in the trash. The eggs were cooked good but werent seasoned. The pancakes were very plain i didnt care for them n the maple syrup was a really basic one wouldnt order this again

Corned beef melt 10.79$ surprising but the corned beef was actually good. It wasnt to sour which corn beef can be n it was seasoned really well. I likes the cheese it was really good but i didnt like the veggies in it i didnt see a purpose to it i wish it was served with mustard there was no sauce if they added a sauce the dish would be alot better"

We ordered the banana nutella crepe with a side of biscuits &amp; gravy and the mountain house skillet with a side of pancakes. The food was good, but nothing noteworthy. Really wish the banana nutella crepe had nutella inside rather than just on the outside. The mountain house skillet was predominately just onions.

I met one of my besties here for brunch while she&#39;s in town visiting. At 11 am on a Tuesday there was a 5-10 minute wait for a table (no biggie). The hostess and our waitress were super nice. I haven&#39;t seen my friend in months, so we were those people who chatted with our beverages for forever before finally looking at the menu to place an order. Our waitress was super understanding though and didn&#39;t care at all. She just told us to put our menus in the middle of the table when we were ready so she didn&#39;t have to bother us by checking in often.

I ordered a decaf coffee and she brought my own canister so I can pour as I please which was great. She still came around and refilled my cup though since I was chatting away. The tiny little metal milk cups were adorable too.

For my meal I went with the eggs your way. For only $5.99 this was a lot of food! Two eggs served how you like them with crispy potatoes, plus your choice of toast, english muffin,
biscuit or a short stack of our buttermilk pancakes. I got my eggs scrambled and chose an english muffin. I was even able to upgrade my potatoes so they had bacon and veggies in them -- delicious!

I&#39;ll definitely be back to try some sweet items and those buttermilk pancakes they&#39;re known for."

This place has an amazing menu with endless possibilities! Our waitress was very nice and thoroughly explained a few dishes and answered any questions we had. She was quite shocked at the &#34;smorgasbord&#34; we ordered. There were 3 of us and we got a ton of food! 

We started off with the crepes as an &#34;appetizer.&#34; I ordered the cinnamon roll pancakes, which literally tasted like a cinnamon roll pressed into a pancake. The icing on the top was absolutely delicious and the pancakes were perfectly fluffy. I got the duck bacon as a side dish and wasn&#39;t too impressed with it. The waitress described it as a &#34;rarer bacon that sometimes need to be cut wth a fork and knife&#34; and that is exactly how it was. It was a little too fatty for me. I also ordered the Bellini, which was tasty and refreshing! 

The rest of our table ordered the following: &#34;eggs your way&#34; with smoked salmon, potatoes, and toast AND the B&amp;G, add the E with potatoes and ham. Everything was absolutely delicious. The portions are huge, so we certainly didn&#39;t finish all of the food. But, we did box it up for later :) 

We came on a Saturday morning around 830-9am and there was no wait! By the time we were done, there was a wait. I would highly recommend this place for a good meal and vast variety!"

I had ordered the Market skillet with onions, shrooms, spinach, Tom, and Broc topped with cheddar and jack cheese. This all comes on homefries and with 2 egg on top (I got sunnyside up). About half way in i though something might be wrong. No tom or broc and was finding bacon pieces. Turns out I was given a Mountain House skillet. similar enough so and I just rolled with it. 

Skillet thoughts: sautéed veggies were awesome, potatoes we nice and crispy, eggs were perfect, but waaay too smothered in cheese for me. Combined with the egg juices, the amount of cheese gave the bowl a consistency close to chili. Kinda a mushy mess, but partly my fault for ordering runny eggs. End of the day it was still tasty enough and filled a void. 

The rye toast and homemade berry jam were both FANTASTIC. I would come back for those alone. 

Her omelette, the Goat, was top notch. I was sorta jealous. Just how she likes it: lots of spinach and tomato and goat cheese. She had a
side of pancakes and shared: heaven.

We went at 8:45 this morning (Friday) and it was crazy crowded within a few minutes of sitting down. I&#39;m guessing it may be because high schools are graduating/finishing this week, and there were a lot of  14-18 y/o kids there. Still, service was prompt and the host, servers, and bus boys we interacted with were great. 

The buttermilk pancakes are excellent - light, but filling. The crispy potato side dish was generally very tasty (and I judge all breakfast places by their potatoes). Some were over-seasoned (especially with salt) and some were barely seasoned, but mixing it up together it was good. The seasoning tastes a bit like those mesquite bbq chips I used to take to lunch in elementary school, and I love it. 

Prices are a little high for some of the beyond basic items compared to what you&#39;d expect in the burbs, but it seems pretty in line with places in the city."

Better yet, maybe I should move into one of those swanky condos behind this breakfast place.  My breakfast cravings would be satisfied for the rest of my life!

I&#39;ve been wanting to go here for a while.  However, every time we attempted to go, which was mostly on a Saturday, the wait was annoying and too long.  I decided to come on a weekday, close to closing time.  Anyways, absolutely ADORABLE restaurant.  It&#39;s modern with a twist of country chic!  Lots of black and white decor....so simple and beautiful.  Also, clean place!!

There&#39;s a lot on the menu.  It took me 20 mins to figure out if I wanted breakfast or lunch, if i wanted to pig out or eat clean.  Screw it, I went and chose something indulgent.  So I&#39;m a sucker for biscuits and gravy. I ordered their B &amp; G with an E: housemade biscuits with sausage gravy, scrambled eggs and a side of potatoes.  Oh geeez, 10 stars for the biscuits and gravy.  Those biscuits are huge, flaky and melt in your mouth perfection with a yummy buttery flavor.  The sausage gravy meshed so well with the biscuits.  Ughhh, it was such a hearty dish, I couldn&#39;t finish it  (they give you 3 big portions of biscuits).  And they top those with fluffy scrambled eggs.  Perfectly cooked. Happy happy joy joy!  

As I said earlier, if you decide to go on the weekend, you need to come early otherwise the wait is ridiculous.  The best is during the weekday in my opinion.  Just take a day off and come here.  And the best part is it&#39;s just a walking distance away from the river so you can enjoy a stroll to walk off whatever you ate!  I hope Buttermilk opens up another location  in the future - hopefully another one in the western suburbs.  Great food!"

Once seated, the waitstaff was very quick to greet and since we had been looking at the menu a while we ordered right away. I got the B &amp; G, add the E. EXTREMELY GOOD AND FILLING!

This place screams delicious from the name, to the decor and most assuredly the food. If Geneva were across the street you&#39;d find me here every weekend. Unfortunately, it&#39;s not. And perhaps that&#39;s for the best considering the size of the breakfast I had here. 

When you walk in, you&#39;re greeted by an atmosphere straight out of New England, as Buttermilk may be just as at home on a quaint street somewhere in the Hamptons. Whitewashed wood, with well-thought accents adorn the restaurant.

The servers are pleasant and friendly, and coming here on a Friday morning around 10, I didn&#39;t have to wait for a second to be seated. I&#39;ll bet that&#39;s not the case on the weekends, as anyone who knows about this place probably stops by. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if wait times get pretty steep during prime brunching times. 

The menu knocked me over with all the amazing choices. Eventually I settled on the chicken fried chicken skillet because I was truly trying to see just how many calories I could consume in one sitting. Spoiler alert? Not really. 

IT WAS INCREDIBLE! Do not adjust your screens, I&#39;m talking in all-caps here. First of all, what was put before me was practically a bucket of freshly fried chicken breast covered in sausage gravy and cheese, blanketed under my over-easy eggs, all sitting atop a mountain of potatoes cooked with bacon and ham plus peppers and onions. Holy cow, I&#39;m drooling just typing all that. 

All that, plus a fresh made buttermilk biscuit that came with fresh preserves and what (in my imagination) was a ball of freshly churned butter. I may have made that last part up, but it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if that was the case. It was very soft and melty. 

As I sat there, I texted pictures of my food and the menu to my wife who has already declared her love for the fried green tomato eggs benedict, even tho she hasn&#39;t had it yet. But she is determined to try it within the next three days. Because fried green tomatoes=everything.

All in all, I loved everything about Buttermilk and hope you do too. I can&#39;t wait to go back, but please save me a chair at your table because I know after reading this review you&#39;re all going to want to go there and I kind of don&#39;t want to share how awesome this place is with the world.

Their staff is so attentive!  We&#39;ve had refills tended to quickly, food arrives hot and plates are cleared promptly. It&#39;s a great breakfast spot!  

A few favorites include the s&#39;mores hot chocolate, their bacon, the banoffee pie and their chocolately goodness waffle.  For the waffle, I would get the almond butter on the side next time as I think it may be unnecessary but I cannot confirm my hunch at this point. 

The whole restaurant is bright and clean. A perfect spot for the family, meeting a friend or a solo breakfast spot. We are slowly working our way through the menu and I am looking forward to that next visit."

Atmosphere: super cute in the inside with a casual vibe
Service: I went an hour before it closed (1:30) with 2 people. Our food came in less than 10 minutes after we ordered it! that was great because we were really hungry (:
Food: The two people I went with got omlets and they were huge (chipotle burrito size huge!) and they loved them. I got a make your own eggs and I got cheesy scrambled eggs that were delicious! the side potatoes that come with almost any meal are seasoned perfectly and are so tasty! I got a small stack of pancakes with my eggs and they were so so good with butter and powdered sugar. I also got two sausages that were really yummy. The apple juice I got to drink tasted really fresh!
There was so much food so we brought three containers worth home!
Overall: Five stars and I will be coming back!!!!!!"

Waited an hour and a half for a table and found out someone stole our table &amp; claimed they were Crowley with a party of 8.  If the restaurant did buzzers like every other restaurant out there that could have been avoided. And so they shoved our table of 8 into a table for 6.  The restaurant is freezing, so bring a blanket!

By the time the food came out, about 45 minutes after we ordered, it was barely Luke warm. Very very underwhelming and not enough of an impression to go back! Sausage gravy and biscuits with no sausage in the gravy. Decent meat omelette that would have been similar at any other restaurant. 

And then to wait 15 minutes to pay, would have dined and dashed if it didn&#39;t fall on the waitress who was very nice."

About 20 mins later we were seated. They have a great menu I had a hard time deciding on what I wanted with so many great options. I went with the filet skillet and my boyfriend got the red rooster skillet. Mine tasted great except my steak came out medium and I like it pretty rare but I won&#39;t knock them too much on that mostly because the flavor was so good, I&#39;d just have to really make it a point in saying a few times make sure it&#39;s rare lol but most people like the steaks done a bit more than myself so anyone else would of thought it was perfect. I also got the biscuit as the side with jam and butter and holly hell was that thing super tasty! That biscuit was no joke haha very good. The boyfriend really enjoyed his skillet as well and he also got the pancakes as his side and almost finished everything lol they give a good portion size! Our waitress was ok, young blonde girl, she was nice seen her a couple times just an average server I&#39;d say though. Anyway I will 100% be coming back here there&#39;s defiantly a few more things I want to try on the menu, would highly recommend this spot!"

Plus when I asked how much longer she said &#34;how many people do you have in your party?&#34; even though I had said just 2 when I checked in. Pretty sure several people who came in after me got seated before me. Oh well. We had a fantastic waitress (Taylor I think) who was so attentive and friendly and great all around. The crepes were standard, but the croissant was very buttery and flakey with thick bacon on it. I probably would not go back for breakfast, but several lunch items looked great! Also the interior is to die for. Future kitchen goals for sure!"

I&#39;ve been here a quite a few times with mixed impressions, not my go-to but a solid option. 

(+) This place is trendy (which, for some, could be a negative). It&#39;s large, clean, and thoughtfully decorated, but loud. There&#39;s a fun coffee bar with fancy-schmancy lattes, if that&#39;s your jam. There&#39;s also a nice drink list and some cool champagne/juice options for groups. 

(+) The menu is an overwhelming array of curious and adventurous options as well as some standby classics. An argument could certainly be made that the menu is a bit too expansive or overwhelming. But, as a typical American, I love me some choices! (Do I need a side of banoffee pie pancakes and a butterscotch latte? Duh.)

(+/-) Service is rushed but generally attentive and helpful. I have had visits where this is not the case, so it&#39;s inconsistent, often based on customer volumes. Most recently, impressions have been positive. 

(+/-) I&#39;ve had awesome (and correspondingly priced) dishes as well as some disappointing duds. Again, there&#39;s some inconsistency to be ironed out still. I think it&#39;s possible there are too many elaborate items that just can&#39;t be consistently executed. 

Overall, I like this place every once in a while (I can&#39;t eat banoffee pie pancakes on the daily) but generally won&#39;t bother unless it&#39;s a weekday due to wait times."

We have found that the quality and taste of the the food has improved as well as the service. It is often quite busy, but they have a decent amount of seating while you&#39;re waiting. The biscuits are quite good now, so much that I ordered the biscuits and chicken and gravy, which is not something that I normally order. Food in generally is pretty good, and you get a TON of it. 

We last went in January, but there were TONS of flies inside. Not house flies, but fruit flies/gnats. While eating, I noticed that there was one pesky fly that I just couldn&#39;t kill. Once I got it, it seemed to regenerate. Closer to the end of my meal, I noticed the glass from the window behind me was covered in gnats..probably 15-20. The waitress seemed unimpressed that we spent some time killing the flies. Honestly, aside from the flies, we had a good experience. There are 2 things I just cannot stand. Hair and bugs. In my food. Ok, neither were in my food, but having the flies flying around my food the entire time was kind of a mood killer."

We called ahead at 9:30 and they had a 30 min wait and did not accept call ahead for the wait list.  By the time we got there, the wait was 45 min but we were sat with in 30 min.

The menu is impressive and hard to pick down to just one item but I ordered the Chicken Fried Chicken under the Biscuits section and also ordered a Blood Mary.  The bloody was a little too pepper focused for my liking vs horseradish.  The Boy&#39;s eyes were as big as his stomach and he wanted to order an entrée AND an order of pancakes.  Thankfully Buttermilk allows you to upgrade your pancakes with any order and he got the Eggs Your Way + Meat and upgraded to the Oats &#39;N Chocolate pancakes.

I wanted to love my dish, the dish was a massive portion and the chicken was nicely seasoned.  The biscuits themselves were very dry and weren&#39;t all that great.  The 2 eggs that came with I ordered poached and asked for a side of Hollandaise to dip.  The hollandaise arrived and was very runny, more of the consistency of melted butter so I was very glad I didn&#39;t go the bene route. The Boy was happy with his dish and we both loved the pancakes.  Normally I don&#39;t like oat pancakes but the oats added a nice crunch to the cakes, the smaller cakes were good but I don&#39;t think I could eat a full order with as much chocolate as they put on them.

Customer service was definitely lacking.  We were hung up on when we called the first time before we could ask our 2nd question and had to call back.  I understand you are busy but a little tact goes a long way.  Our server was nice but not exactly friendly, and a server at a neighboring table dropped a syrup carafe that shattered and got syrup down my pant leg. The syrup on the floor was cleaned up but my sticky pant leg and the broken carafe pieces that went under my chair went unnoticed.  Cute concept but there is room for improvement."

This has happened twice to us and we have heard the same story from others regarding this restaurant. Sad that Buttermilk can&#39;t get out of its own way.

The food is either great or a disappointment. Meaning at least one person in your party is going to start their day on the wrong foot. I loved my stuffed biscuits and gravy, unfortunately there was no skill in my fiancés skillet.

This place is saved from 2 stars to avoid blow back from the mass amount of hipsters and yuppies in the area who are quick to defend a breakfast restaurant named Buttermilk. If you like rolling the dice and $7 mimosas, this place is for you. High risk high reward."

Fast forward to today. I went and picked him up and said where to? &#34;Geneva.&#34;  Now we don&#39;t live too far, but I was a little pissy at a 30 minute drive to get breakfast. I have a few spots near me that are excellent. 

We get here and the wait is super short even for a Sunday morning. I ordered the giant ball of breakfast, and it was incredible. There was biscuits and gravy and sausage and cheese and eggs. Wow. It was a total foodgasm. Hey served potatoes on the side with it. Which had little pieces of ham and pepper and had some cheese on top. Not a ton, but enough to make it a delicious garnish. 

My buddy got these cinnamon roll pancakes on the side with his chicken fried chicken. He literally forced me to have some of the pancakes, and I will say that I was absolutely stupid for trying to turn them down in the first place. 

Service is great. Everything was out super quick. Let us hang for a while. Super spot! Even if it is 30 minutes from my house. I&#39;m glad I made the drive. And I will certainly make it again."

Buttermilk, coconut milk and one other milk. Shredded coconut and powder sugar covered the toast. Coconut milk infused fresh cream. Creamy and crunchy toast. Just the right level of richness and sweetness. The coconut milk really kept it on the lighter side. I also ordered a side of bacon. The bacon was a thicker cut but it was not greasy.

My boyfriend and I arrived around 1pm on a Monday and were seated immediately. The place wasn&#39;t too crowded so it wasn&#39;t overly noisy which I assume is typical on the weekend and what other reviews have said. 

I ordered a caramel latte to drink and my boyfriend ordered the coffee, both tasted great and the coffee came with a decanter so you could refill yourself. 

We both ordered off the lunch menu, I got the pig and fig sandwich with regular fries. The sandwich was just okay for my taste, between the fig preserve spread and melted brie cheese I thought it would make for a special sandwich but the ham just tasted like lunch meat ham you would get at the store (hence the 4 stars), it would have perfect if they had used ham off the bone like in one of their other sandwiches, that is if you like a sweet and salty combo! 

My boyfriend ordered the DLT sandwich which is DUCK BACON, yes you hear me, and it was just as delicious as it sounds. He added avocado for $1 and also got the sweet potato fries which were nice, thick and crispy! 

Our waitress was very friendly and attentive contrary to other reviews I&#39;ve read. I suggest not going on the weekend at peak rush hours if you can just to have a more relaxed experience like we did. Our bill came out to $30.61 which is pretty decent considering we both got drinks!

I had a vanilla latte and my husband had a mint mocha to drink. I thought both were delicious but husband favored mine more than his. We also split a chicken-fried chicken skillet (poached eggs are a MUST) and the lemon blueberry pancakes as a side. 

I was so incredibly happy with everything. This place rivals even my beloved Nosh. I&#39;d love to go again and try their other offerings, especially their cinnamon roll pancakes. I hope they start to have pumpkin-flavored things since fall is around the corner!

I know these cute kitschy breakfast-and-lunch only places are kind of a dime a dozen these days, but I LIVE for brunch and so on my day off, my mom and I went and tried this place out. Here&#39;s what made it so awesome:

-HUGE coffee menu. This is not your standard regular-or-decaf. With a full espresso bar and a ton of fancy choices, you can&#39;t go wrong ordering a delicious speciality drink. I got a cookie butter latte which was rich, decadent, and so tasty. 
-Tons of menu options, with not a lot of weird or plain stuff you&#39;d never actually order.
-Their speciality is biscuits, which is a pretty fun thing to make your selling point. Us northerners don&#39;t really see a ton of interesting biscuit options.
-The portions. Are. Enormous. Seriously I can eat a LOT of brunch, and I struggled to get through my meal. My mom barely made it halfway through hers.
-I got the chicken fried chicken skillet which was UHHHHHMAZING. A huge piece of chicken fried chicken, bacon, sausage, ham, cheese, onion and peppers covered in sausage gravy and two eggs. Not for every day. So worth it.
-For an up charge, you can get a specialty pancake as your side instead of plain. I got the cinnamon roll pancakes which were soooooo good. Way too sweet to be your main meal unless you&#39;re a huge sugar fan, but amazing as a small side option. 
-PRICES. Are you kidding me with the prices? That huge skillet I got which had every ingredient under the sun? ELEVEN BUCKS. Way further east, that would be $15 and half as huge/good. With fundrinks, skillet, a Benedict for my mom, the specialty cakes, our total was seriously like $35. Awesome.
-Bright, happy, clean interior with a modern but welcoming theme.

In short, there&#39;s nothing not to love about this place. I can&#39;t wait to get back and try more of that insanely expansive menu!"

After finishing a 5K in Geneva, my friend and I wanted to go to brunch.  This place looked cute and appealing from the outside so we decided to give it a try.  There were people waiting outside, so it had to be good, right?!
We were told there was a 30-35 minute wait and given a buzzer which we could take a half mile from the place.  We walked around the area to kill time, only to wait closer to 45 minutes.  Sometimes places over exaggerate, sometimes under... And really, what breakfast place isn&#39;t crowded on a Sunday morning??? We were fine waiting.
I had just finished a 90 day challenge at my gym the day before so the last thing I wanted was boring ol&#39; egg whites with spinach or that nonsense...I was totally down with something more exciting, and well...even not-so-healthy while I take a few days &#34;break&#34; to do some indulging before getting back on that wagon!  This was the perfect place to do that.
I flipped that menu back and forth having no clue what to order, EVERYTHING looked good... red velvet french toast? crepes?  I settled on the oatmeal strawberry chocolate pancakes, which I put a dent in, and took the rest home.  My friend and I also ordered a side of bacon which was really delicious, very little fat on it, and not greasy at all.
They also have an extensive list of coffee on their menu, as well as bloody marys, mimosas, you name it.  This is brunch heaven.

What I really appreciated is that they give you extra water and a small coffee pot to refill your coffee without having to wait for your server.  

My friend and I really enjoyed our brunch here, and it was well worth the wait.
This place is awesome! I&#39;m really glad I checked it out!"

The first time my husband and I visited, everything was great, the food was great, the service was great, everything. We originally came because we had several friends raving about this place, not to mention the 4 and a half star rating (that once was). My husband had the stuffed biscuit and I had the Greek yogurt waffle - delicious!
My mom was visiting from out of town so we decided to bring her today, especially after how wonderful our first visit was. Needless to say, we were extremely disappointed. The service was okay, my mom had the smoked salmon benedict -poached eggs were luke warm - my mom asked the server if they could bring her a new plate because the egg was not hot and fresh (She rarely returns food) The server brought her original plate back and stated that their salmon benedict is served cold - this is no where to be found on the menu - my mom went ahead and ate it. My husband got the chilequiles, to try something new,  and they were mediocre. Nothing to write home about. Honestly we were so disappointed in this visit and may not return. We were shocked to see the low star rating before we came for breakfast, after our visit, we aren&#39;t shocked anymore."

We went on a Friday around 11:30 AM. We were told a 25 minute wait from a hostess, but it turned out to only be about 10 minutes, if that. It wasn&#39;t bad at all.

Our food came relatively quickly considering how busy the place was. Our waitress never stopped by during our meal, and we had to ask other servers/busboys for things, which was fine I guess.

The food: 

I had the Goat Omelette -- an omelette with chicken sausage, spinach, sun-dried tomatoes, and herbed goat cheese. Literally was SMOTHERED on the inside with the goat cheese, which was so crazy over powering it was nauseating. Then there was a big dollop of the cheese on the top of the omelette, too. Imagine eating spoonfuls for herbed goat cheese. That&#39;s what this tasted like. The multigrain toast was a nice thick piece. The potatoes had no flavor at all so we added salt and hot sauce and ate maybe half. Wish I&#39;d had the option for hash browns instead.

Like everyone else said, it was pretty expensive, too. $10.99 for that omelette, the bland potatoes, and one piece of toast. 

Friend had the Red Rooster Skillet -- pretty cool presentation in the skillet pan but she said it was a bit difficult to eat because of this. She liked it for the most part. 

The longest time we spent waiting was after we were done eating it took about 25  minutes for our waitress to drop off our check and get it taken care of. Our waitress knew the service was not good as she apologized for not checking in on us more when she dropped off the check and saw me reaching for the comment card.

Will give it another try but not for a while."

There was no wait, but it was pretty busy for a week day. Our server was attentive, friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. I had difficulty choosing which item to order because so many dishes on the menu read unique and interesting. My typical go-to for breakfast is Eggs Benedict so I decided on ordering the Dixie Benny. De-li-cious! I find the side potatoes served in most restaurants as boring and bland and something I could do without, but the potatoes at Buttermilk were fantastic. I&#39;ve already blabbed to my other friends about this place and am hoping to make it back a few times over the next couple weeks so I can try some other items."

I came in today with my daughter and put in for seating for a table of 5 (my girlfriend and her kids were on their way). I was told there was a 30 minute wait. Nine minutes later our buzzer went off, in the meantime my girlfriend took her two daughters and baby to their two stall bathroom). I went to check in and told the hostess the rest of the party was in the bathroom. I was told we can&#39;t be seated because the entire party wasn&#39;t up front. Uh ok. My girlfriend took 15 minutes in the bathroom because there are two stalls and a line. Meanwhile, our table was given away. While I was waiting not only was the hostess loudly saying how she&#39;s waiting on my party (sounding beyond annoyed) she was giving my daughter and I dirty looks. Finally my girlfriend came out and she says to her, you need to put that stroller somewhere Hun. Uh, hi to you too?

We stopped in on a Monday morning (no school for students) to check it out- and we were so glad we got there before 9 am as it got crazy busy with a wait after that. We started out with their basket of biscuits- and ours were absolutely delicious. Perfectly browned on the top, still warm and moist- and the jam and honey butter went perfectly with them. We realized afterwards that we didn&#39;t need them due to the large portion sizes- but we were glad we tried them as they are a house specialty. 

Each of us tried something different for breakfast- a chicken fried chicken skillet, their breakfast sandwich that is smothered in gravy, and their cinnamon roll pumpkin pancakes (seasonal)- we all loved our dishes, and every single one of us had at least one meal of leftovers. For us the food was excellent and the service was good which is why I&#39;m going with 4 stars. I loved the space itself- and I would definitely return in the future.

It tastes like every other typical suburban breakfast restaurant. It doesn&#39;t stand out at all. I ordered the chicken fried chicken skillet which was a surprise to see on a menu in the nothern US. The chicken was bland and the luckily the gravy and the other flavors from the skillet helped, but overall it was just ok. Wasn&#39;t bad.....wasn&#39;t fantastic. The pancakes on the side tasked like they came out of a box. For me pancakes are special and when breakfast restaurants don&#39;t make a really good pancake it&#39;s almost insulting. 

I also ordered a dopio espresso. I will admit to being a coffee snob. I knew it was going to be a problem when I walked in and noticed the Nespresso machine. I will leave it at that. 

We were there early on Sunday morning and beat most of the rush so, that was good that we didn&#39;t have to wait too long.

Everything on the menu sounded delicious even my Gluten free menu  (although quite limited) sounded pretty yummy. So we ordered our food and waited. Our waitress seemed a little bothered when we asked questions about the menu, even though we did let her know it was our first time there. So we got our food and the presentation was executed very well. The pancakes looked like they were from a cooking magazine and the skillets were in these really nice iron bowls. Unfortunately the flavor wasn&#39;t there. The chilaquiles had no taste. They were literally just tortillas with a bland verde sauce. The filet mignon skillet was very cheesy( which is great) but the meat had no flavor. The honey bun pancakes were phenomenal, but the cinnamon bun ones needed a little more cream cheese icing to complete the wow factor. All in all, we thought the place was very nicely decorated, the service was ok, and the food was ok. Would we make a special trip to come back, maybe, just for the pancakes."

I have been here many times within the last few months since its been open and have been getting a chorizo omelette ever since. The coffee is mediocre but the water tastes fresh and clean.

On the flip side, there are some things I&#39;ve noticed about the service that make me less than satisfied. For starters, they recently made it so you can&#39;t make a &#34;build an omelette,&#34; you have to pick one that is pre-created and change it from there, but my waitress today did not seem happy that I didn&#39;t want jalapeños- they hurt my stomach, give me a break!

My wife had two pancakes with a side of apple sausage. Sausage was great, pancakes were okay. Highly recommend ordering pancakes as a side rather than entree - the smaller size is still plenty big. (They can always be a substitute for toast.)

I had the fried green tomato Benedict which was fabulous. The Remoulade Hollandaise is a bit spicy, so be forewarned. (I think I&#39;ll ask for the plain Hollandaise next time; the spice tends to overpower the flavor of the tomatoes.) I paid the extra $2 for the farmhouse potatoes, well worth it. 

We like our coffee a bit strong, so the coffee was too weak for our taste. It&#39;s hard to find a breakfast restaurant with strong coffee. 

Prices are comparable to Egg Harbor and the food is a little better, in my opinion. 

We&#39;ll be back. 

Updated 1/2/16:

We came back with a party of eight. At first, it looked like we could get seated right away, but the hostess said she couldn&#39;t seat us until our whole party in was in the building (4 were walking in from the parking lot-which we told the hostess). 

After being given a pager and not being told how long the wait would be (I had to ask for that info), and being told the wait was 20-30 minutes, we called Nosh and found we could get seated right away.

My family and I head down at least once a week for either breakfast or lunch. I have yet to have a meal that was sub-par.

But to be honest, with Egg Harbor Cafe and a few other breakfast places in downtown Geneva, wouldn&#39;t it make more sense to open in St. Charles or Batavia? 

That aside, let&#39;s get to the food. The orange-strawberry juice was certainly fresh and quite enjoyable. I like pulp in my juice and this was a little smoother than what I was hoping for. Still tasted good. We also got a biscuit and this was not like a typical dry round biscuit. It was more of an oval shape and they had a tangier taste than what I&#39;m used to. With some whipped butter and a little honey, it was quite good. 

Then I had the Mountain house skillet with scrambled eggs, wild mushrooms, caramelized onions, sautéed spinach, hickory smoked bacon, cheddar and jack cheese. I never expected a portion quite this large. It came in a big steel bowl, which was cool. All the ingredients complemented each other incredibly well. The one thing I could have used was some avocado. The potatoes were fine, but they could have been a little crispier. On the side, I got the lemon-blueberry pancakes. I&#39;m not a pancake guy at all, but I figured this was the place to give one a shot. I got two cakes with berries, plus blueberry syrup, and powdered sugar. The berry flavor was strong, not overwhelming. And the hint of lemon flavor in the pancake helped cut the sweetness of the blueberries, so the combination works well.

The service was fine, the food tasted good, and the presentation was nice as well. Prices are a bit high; I mean, who would want to spend $5.00 for a bowl of berries? I enjoyed my experience, but I have to say Egg Harbor is still the best breakfast place that I&#39;ve ever been to."

After waiting more than a half hour for a table before asking if we were still on the list, we were finally seated near the window toward the back of the restaurant. The service, as many have said, is spotty. Our waitress was not particularly attentive, and in fact missed something quite significant, which I will explain in just a second. Let&#39;s talk first about the food: I ordered biscuits with jam to start, followed by a veggie omelette with potatoes and buttermilk pancakes. Like so many brunch restaurants, the portions were huge. In fact, they really were too big. I never did touch the buttermilk pancakes, as the biscuits and omelets were plenty. What was interesting about the food though, is that all of it was cooked in far too much butter! I know what you are thinking; you are thinking, &#34;Leslie, please, the place is called Buttermilk. Of course everything is drowned in butter!&#34; But butter and buttermilk are two different things, and although Julia Child may have been a proponent of butter, even she would think this restaurant was using too much. The butter in the biscuits, particularly, overwhelms any honey flavor that might be in there. 

I said that we would return to the topic of service, and so we shall. My husband does not like butter; he is not lactose intolerant, but has similar reactions to butter in particular. He mentioned his aversion to butter to the waitress when we asked about the biscuits. She was very upfront and explained that the biscuits were coated in a buttery mix before they even went into the oven. What&#39;s strange though, is that she did not mention the fact the corned beef my husband was also ordering was covered in butter as well. In fact, the corned beef had such a strong butter flavor, my husband could not actually eat it. This would have been a helpful tip when ordering, as he could have asked that the corned beef be cooked in olive oil, which one might expect anyway.

So overall, I am not in a big rush to return to Buttermilk. I could get the same quality food from several other restaurants down the street, perhaps with better service and shorter wait times. More importantly, the food will not be slathered in butter."

Definitely coming back. Blows Nosh out of the water."

We went to around the river and by the time we came back it was ready. 

The foods was good, got the omelet and skillet. The egg in the omelet was fluffy which is good, I was happy with that. The decor, is great the theme I think, they wanted to go for was &#34;Modern Farm&#34; main colors only has was grey, white and black. The detail, little things as such, syrup holder; the white shape color, sleek-minimal style. This place, reminded me of it&#39;s could be in Chicago, possible River North or Lincoln Park. Cool-hip Vibes. The price was little pricey, but most of the products they&#39;re used are organics, I think and it&#39;s in Geneva, too. Check it out, sometime."

Very happy to have a chic new breakfast spot in this sleepy little town. I recently moved from downtown and I know class and style when I see it and this place is just a winner. I went two weeks ago and the service was impeccable. I loved that the oh so chic manager checked on varies tables to include mine, to make sure we were satisfied and I was. 
I ordered the infamous duck bacon and being that I only eat turkey bacon, I wanted to have another order! Wow...amazeballs! I also enjoyed their fresh, homemade buttermilk biscuit with raspberry jam and an egg white omelet with goat cheese. Delish!!
I&#39;ll be back....often."

After they stopped serving brunch, they opened up the entire restaurant for a baby shower. It&#39;s such a cute place! The food and service was wonderful! The only negative was we were not able to set up the room until 2:45 after we were told we&#39;d be able to by 2:15. It all worked out though and the shower was perfect!

First off, we were a table of 4 and a toddler. We ordered our drinks and one of the coffee mugs had lipstick still on it. We brushed it off and asked for a new one. Then we ordered, when the orders came out 3 out of 4 breakfast plates were wrong! We still didn&#39;t make a big deal about it since they were almost similar to what we originally ordered. We asked for bacon and the brought us a nice COLD plate of chopped up bacon! The plate was warmer than the bacon! To top it all off when we split the check and gave our credit cards they charged the wrong bill to the cards. 

Out of respect to the many servers and people working for tips we left 15% but our waitress didn&#39;t deserve more than $4 based on her carelessness but she did let management know and what&#39;s worse is they completely avoided speaking to us and at least apologizing. The place was not overly busy there was an entire wing with open tables so they have no excuse for they mishap. 

Being such a new business you would expect them to be a little more carefully and a little more courteous. 

Despite the lovely appearance and the good food, the service is overall what ruined our experience at Buttermilk. Needless to say we will not be returning."

Recently I took a Greekish salad to go ( a new salad) sooo good!

Everyone/place has a bad day so I hope this isn&#39;t the norm, though.  I will say the menu looks good &amp; they have some damn tasty buttermilk biscuits. My Mountain House Skillet was delicious as well.  But, the Hubs pancakes (just regular buttermilk, nothin&#39; fancy) needed another minute or two on the griddle - they were still a bit doughy on the inside. Considering the place is called Buttermilk one would think they&#39;d have the timing of how long the pancakes have to be on the griddle down.  Perhaps it was because one pancake was huge and the other was small in the short stack of 2 pancakes (small pancake hidden on the bottom).

The service was not great, either. All the bus boys were smiling but we didn&#39;t see a single server or hostess actually smile while we were there. Geesh, I realize it was a busy Saturday morning but c&#39;mon... And the syrup carafe that our server dropped off had a bunch of syrup running down half of it, something I doubt they could have missed - perhaps a minor detail and something I&#39;d expect at Denny&#39;s but at this place I would hope they&#39;d take the time to wipe these things off before giving them to the next customer. When it was time to pay the check my husband put his credit card in the holder &amp; then went to use the restroom. Our server came &amp; picked it up &amp; then dropped it back off (before he returned), setting it right in front of me and said, &#34;This is all set for you to sign.&#34; Clearly she hadn&#39;t even bothered looking at the name on the card or she would have known it was my husband&#39;s card (not a gender neutral name by any means) - disconcerting in this age of continual credit card fraud.

The decor is sleek &amp; cool, though all those hard surfaces &amp; an open ceiling make for one loud restaurant.  We found ourselves really having to raise our voices just to hear one another across the tiny table."

I came here earlier in the week with a few friends (5) we were told there was a 45 minute wait for a table, but after 15 minutes we were called up to be seated. Our server was prompt to assist us once we were seated. We ordered fresh squeezed orange juice, which was good, but I prefer another restaurant up the street when it comes to fresh OJ. We ordered Banana Toffee Pancakes (not sure what the actual name was) which were amazing. We also ordered Eggs Benedict with Pulled Pork, amazing. My only complaint was that the portions were rather large and we had a lot of unfinished food, which we put in boxes for later. Overall, I would recommend Buttermilk! I will be back soon!"

Me and a guest walked in and the place was slammed, at least 20+ people waiting for tables. I counted 6 open tables and booths and yet no one was being seated. We were greeted by a stressed out fossil at the hostess station and told the wait would be about 15-20 minutes. We were sat sometime in that time frame but literally watched 5 groups of people walk out in that time, which is a shame because there were places for them to sit, but a couple unorganized hostess missed them.

Anyways we sat down and our server came in a timely manner. Although we didnt get any, they have a pretty extensive coffee menu that looked like it would satisfy any run of the mill starbucks order.

I ordered the croque monseur with the egg and side of apples with honey and cinnamon. My date ordered the red rooster skillet with pancakes. 16 minute ticket time I felt was reasonable considering how slammed they were.

The croque monseur was out of this world. It was soooo friggin good. One of the absolute best breakfast menu items ive ever had. The apples complimented it well and tasted great too. 

My date really liked her skillet as well and from what i tasted it was great. The pancake was really good as well. Definitely above average.

All in all it took about an hour to be seated, get our food then check and leave. I cant really dock them any stars for the sub-par service others were getting but there wasnt really a time where people were waiting for tables and there were empty tables available. The table behind me sat empty for 10 minutes before someone was seated. If the geriatric and the bubble head at the station get their stuff together this could be the best breakfast spot in the fox valley. Seriously.

Ill definitely be back, definitely recommend to everyone including families with kids (they had a kids menu), and definitely hope they get their management situation fixed so they stay for a while.

5 stars."

It&#39;s $16.95 for all you can eat lunch &amp; $19.99 all you can eat dinner. They have an excellent selection as well!! We always switch it up and get some specialty rolls, edamame, gyoza, miso soup, and sushi as part of the deal; however, there&#39;s a lot more on there. They also have a regular menu aside from all you can eat, dessert and drink (alcohol) menu as well. 

The service is outstanding, very friendly, and attentive. I&#39;ve tried nearby sushi places and would deff say Oishi has the best quality and prices!"

It seems conceptually akin to &#34;two for the price of one amputations&#34;. However, because we are sushi swine, so sometimes the budget (and cravings) justify giving AYCES another try (BTW, if you haven&#39;t figured it out, that is my newly coined acronym for the first quoted text in this review...for the latter, TFTPOOA simply doesn&#39;t work!). 

We have been twice to Oishi for lunch and may have FINALLY found an AYCES stop that works! In case you don&#39;t &#34;follow&#34; my reviews, let me state up front that I (and my constant companion) are sushi snobs. We make disparaging remarks about people who consider eating rolls to be eating sushi. We ridicule those who have tried only warm sake and think that defines trying sake. So, we are asses. However, that should lend itself to all the more weight being added to this review. We are by our ass-y natures not people who would typically eat at, let alone even try, an all you can eat sushi restaurant. Yet we have tried Oishi. In fact, we have been back several times. Give Oishi a try!

To start, you have to like the guy who greets you at the door. I presume that he is the owner but don&#39;t know that. He is always smiling, friendly, and happy to strike up a conversation. Some people are simply likeable. That&#39;s this guy. I want him to be my friend and I don&#39;t even know him!

If a nice owner is not sufficient to recommend a sushi spot in your book, then go for the surprising quality of the fish. While Oishi is certainly not buying its fish from the same markets and sources as Naoki or Arami (our &#34;1&#34; and &#34;1.5&#34; ass-y favorites in Chicagoland), somehow they are doing something better than most of their peer restaurants. The flavor of everything that we have tried has been good and the temperature and cuts are correct. Rolls are for the most part &#34;typical and expected&#34; but they are well prepared and there are few that are not expected for &#39;this type&#39; of establishment.

While they obviously do not offer any sake that can even approach Naoki&#39;s &#34;denshin rin&#34;, their sake cups area solid choice (how ass-y was that comment!). The service is fast and efficient and the price is very reasonable meaning that this is easily accessible as a lunch alternative in the area. Nice people running a nice restaurant that offers a great value, what more can you ask!"

Ranging from fresh sushi, a wide variety of appetizers and courteous and prompt service, it&#39;s always been a great time to dine here. 

Located in the strip mall next to La Fortuna Cafe (also great!) and Whole Foods, this place provides ample parking for its patrons and the inside of this establishment has always been clean and very Feng-Shui. I wish this place would actually be a tad larger as I believe their business deserves to bloom as it does. The owner and his workers here tend very well to each party that comes in and I&#39;ve never had a bad experience here in the year or two that I&#39;ve come in. 

Keep this place going, it&#39;s hard to find a good (or overhyped) sushi establishment in the suburbs."

I&#39;m always up for trying a new restaurant that offers AYCE sushi!  They had quite an extensive menu. I ordered:


Appetizer: 
+Veggie tempura
Two pieces of sweet potato, 1 broccoli, 1 onion, 1 mushroom, and 1 zucchini.  It came out PIPING hot.  Good stuff.


Maki:
+ Spider
Pretty standard.

+ Caterpillar
Also standard.  Creamy avocado goodness, oms!

+ White Dragon
Just OK.  I wish the escolar on top was more substantial. 

+ Spicy Tuna
Very good!  This is a &#34;typical&#34; order for me, but I find most places are lacking on the spice. The spice here was mild (maybe a 4-5, which is totally relative), but still present.


Nigiri:
I ordered multiple (tuna, salmon, escolar, sea bass, octopus, masago, eel), which can be found at most places. My only gripe is that they used too much rice in my opinion.

+Smoked Salmon
I don&#39;t usually see SMOKED salmon as a nigiri option, and this was great.


Service was attentive.  The waitress was very sweet, and she (and the owner [?]) came and refilled our waters and my friend&#39;s son&#39;s pop quite frequently.

In all, I think Oishi was a nice change of pace from the AYCE sushi places I frequent and worthy of a return trip."

I came here on a Friday around 6 for dinner with a friend. They offered an AYCE sushi deal for $19.95 at dinnertime (it&#39;s around 16.95 for lunch time). The AYCE menu is not a big as the full menu, but still had tons of sushi, maki, and even appetizers to choose from.

I was REALLY nervous about my first experience, as they do charge for any food you can&#39;t finish. I tried to order conservative and got two rolls and an appetizer. The gyoza app was great! 5 dumplings, loaded with pork and served with a sauce on the side. 

My rolls were also good. The two I chose were the Chicago Bears roll and a Mexican roll. The Bears was much better than the Mexican roll. Both had tempura shrimp, the bears one was topped with avocado. The Mexican roll had peppers in it and was topped with guacamole. For some reason, the Mexican roll just tasted too dry to me, with all the veggies and rice. The guac didn&#39;t seem to help it. The rolls were a good size and full with fresh ingredients, so I think I&#39;ll just need to choose again. My dining pal ordered about double what I did and was able to finish it all, so I think I could go for a little more next time! It was a good value though, even with how I ordered. I believe the total of my food without the deal would&#39;ve been around $29, so I still did ok. My friend enjoyed all of her food as well!

The free edamame served with the meal was yummy too!

I&#39;ve been trying to find friends to bring back here soon. I want to try more of the menu and give them the 5 star rating, because I do think that potential is there!!

Services were great. We had a big table for 3 families. They served fairly quickly after we ordered every single time. My younger one was the only one ordered the stir fired noodles instead of eating the sushi. Her noodle tasted really good.

The price was just over $16.00 each. the appetizers were very good.
The fish was Very fresh, the rice was delicious and the fish to rice ratio was perfect! The roles were flavorful and not smothered with sauce,  which is what some places do to cover the taste of their bland fish. 
Had a nice chat with the very owner, who is very in tune to his customer&#39;s needs and a pleasant conversationalist and world traveler.

They had the typical maki as any other sushi buffet place in Chicago such as the spider roll, spicy tuna roll, california roll. As well as all types of sushi from salmon, tuna, octopus and the typical others nothing much fancy. The fish wasn&#39;t the most fresh i ever ate, but it was decent. The time we went it was empty shockingly we were the only people in there. Most likely due to the construction outside.

I also had smoked salmon sushi, spicy scallop sushi, and tuna sushi. My son had rainbow, California, and dynamite rolls. The spicy dynamite roll was too much for him, so we had to take it home.

Party of 2 went for AYCE lunch.  Including my table there were 6 tables occupied.  Of those 6, 3 were finishing up and no longer ordering as they left soon after I was seated.  That left 3 tables ordering food.  I submitted my first order page which wasn&#39;t large at all- couple appetizers, 4 rolls, and 8 sushi.  The appetizers came out in about 5 minutes.  The sushi order took 30 MINUTES to come out.  Also note know there were 2 sushi guys behind the bar making sushi the entire time.  
I then submitted a 2nd order page of sushi thinking the first order was a fluke.  NOPE.  Again 30 minutes for an even smaller order- 2 rolls and 5 sushi.  Are you kidding me?  Also by that time another table had left leaving only my table and another table.  Two tables total. 

It took 1 hour to get two small sushi orders.  I wanted to order one more time but really didn&#39;t want to wait another 30 minutes.  Maybe this is their strategy.  Just take forever serving the food.  Save money on food costs.  Eventually the customer will leave out of frustration.

AYCE is always something I&#39;m down for. The sushi was alright. They had a good roll with Jalepenos and yellowtail I believe. I may have been one of the first customers....cause my spicy salmon roll was actually sweet and not spicy....kinda random. But from my experience, some of these AYCE places make wrong rolls so whatever. Service was good too. 

Kind of hard to see inside the place from the outside. I think they have shades that darken the windows...I&#39;d recommend getting rid of those cause when people drive by they can&#39;t see if the place is busy or not. My sister&#39;s bf drove by and wanted to go in but the place appeared closed so he didn&#39;t go in...just a friendly tip."

However, i have a big qualm! I came in at noon today (4th of July). When i got the bill, i got charged the dinner price. They claim they charge dinner price on the holiday.

Yes, it is a nice AYCE sushi place, I agree.  It is probably better than some of those typical AYCE sushi restaurants. At least my husband liked here. I am a bit more picky when it comes to Japanese food and I&#39;ve got some mixed feeling. Price is great but some non sushi appetizers were not real to me.

Only giving 4 stars because they charge 3 year olds the full kids price - not many 3 year olds can eat raw food or like sushi so they&#39;re often stuck eating miso soup and that&#39;s about it.  Not worth it to bring young kids here - otherwise we love this place!!"

Unfortunately, gluten-free dough is much less forgiving than regular dough. Once it is cooked, it has to be served the second it comes out of the oven, as each minute passes, it seizes up more and becomes harder to eat.  In my case, the dough was so tough I had to ask for a steak knife to cut it (and I still struggled).

I would recommend giving it a little more attention and re-working the recipe.  I am fortunate to travel a lot and have tried many GF crusts throughout the country, and would rank this particular crust at the bottom of all of the GF pizzas I have tried.  

If you want a home run when it comes to GF pizza, consult Roberto Caporuscio or Antonio Starita from Keste out of NYC (Voted #1 Pizza in NYC).  They are the pioneers in Neapolitan-style gluten-free pizza - and the best I found after sampling GF pizza from coast to coast."

This place does pizza very well, which we think we&#39;re qualified to say, having studied in Italy. The server was incredibly nice and patient, and the outside patio was great for a summer evening. 

The Regina Margherita is a classic margherita done well, just cheesy enough and with a really great sauce. The Fiamme is a great option for those who like arugula and raw prosciutto, but not for everyone. The Diavolo is a spicy pepperoni that has a substantial heat. The Roasted Vegetable was, without a doubt, my favorite topped with goat cheese and a balsamic reduction. We also got the Montanara fried pizza, which was a different and really tasty texture."

It was packed when we came on a Saturday night around 9p.  We had called ahead a few hours before we came to see if we needed a reservation, which was a good thing because otherwise we would have probably needed to wait an hour for a table.  There was a band playing so it was very loud inside.  The music was good, but I feel like they could have turned it down a notch since the restaurant isn&#39;t that big.  It was a little difficult to have a conversation at the table without yelling, but manageable.  

There&#39;s a Yelp check-in freebie, so don&#39;t forget to check in!  Free Sophia Grazia dessert, which is fried dough drizzled with chocolate and strawberry syrup.

They have a private lot, but it&#39;s small.  There&#39;s a free parking garage a block over on Van Buren if this lot is full, or some street parking on Washington."

The crust gets these nice bubbles and it&#39;s kind of chewy with the perfect amount of saltiness.  I&#39;ve had the Roasted Vegetable and Proscuitto &amp; Arugula and both were great.  But, I will say that the waitress recommended I add some garlic to the P&amp;A pizza and it was a great idea.  The pizzas are pretty big too, it lasted me 3 meals.

Dessert was free with a Yelp check in: enjoyed that quite a bit.

First thought: Man, this is a tiny parking lot.  The parking lot is small and is one way, so if you don&#39;t find somewhere to park you need to circle around, street park, or use the public garage (restaurant is in DT Naperville).  Luckily I circled and found a spot in the lot.  Score.

The place is on the smaller side. On a Tuesday night at 6:30 most of the tables were full.  Glad I made a reservation!  $5 Moscow Mule night must be popular!

The restaurant has one of those open ceiling floor plans where you almost have to shout to hear people.  I sat at a table with 10 people so I could only hear those close to me.  The décor at this place was nice and cozy feeling.  The doors open for an outdoor patio, which will be great in the summer.  I definitely want to check it out then, I bet that helps the noise situation.  (Yeah, I am old)

The food was good.  Everyone is my group liked what they got.  I had the Fiamme pizza on a gluten free crust, which is tomato sauce, mozzarella, tomatoes, prosciutto, arugula, and parmesan.  Yum.  The hubs got a pizza that was on lightly fried dough.  He liked it so much he ate the whole thing.  The nugget got the a kids pizza, just crust and cheese....apparently he no longer likes sauce.

If you check in on Yelp you get a free deep fried dough dessert.  I heard it was good...though I could not try any.  The nugget had the kids size mint chocolate chip gelato.  It came with whipped cream on top and he loved it.

Overall, good place, need to check it out during the warm months."

Fiammé fits in quite nicely with the bustling Naperville neighborhood.    I wound up parking in a garage a few blocks from the restaurant not knowing they had a parking lot though it looked like space there was limited.    Besides a little walking always does the body good...LOL.     The inside of the restaurant was cozy though quite loud.   I found it a challenge to carry on a conversation with my natural &#34;inside voice&#34;...*LOL*.    It would be interesting to check it out again in warmer weather when they open up their outside area to see if the same issues exist.

That minor issue aside I enjoyed my meal.   I knew going in that I had to try one of their oak-fired oven baked pizzas.    All the choices sounded so tasty but in the end my love of mushrooms won out.   I chose their appropriately named Funghi pizza with porchini mushrooms, romano and mozzarella cheeses, and basil.    That wound up being a good choice.  I loved the slight crunchy but chewy thin pizza dough and the ingredients complimented each other well.   

 It doesn&#39;t seem like you could go wrong with anything you pick.   A few of my fellow yelpers opted for the shrimp pesto dish.   I&#39;m a big seafood lover as well so I would definitely try that one out as well.

I wound up also ordering the limoncello chicken wings.   I&#39;ve always been a &#34;wing&#34;-man so the minute I saw that I couldn&#39;t look away.   I had to try it.   And I wasn&#39;t disappointed.   The lemon taste was subtle giving just enough bite without being overly tangy.   It came with pizza bread though I opted not to eat much of the bread since I ordered the pizza as well.

I washed my meal down with some agua and a couple glasses of their Moscow Mule drink which they had a special $5 Tuesday rate.    I loved the MM.

For checking in I also received a complimentary dessert of Sophia Grazie.   It wound up being a huge portion of what&#39;s best described as chewy dough sticks with drizzled chocolate and strawberry sauce with powdered sugar.    Presentation wise it looked good but it probably wouldn&#39;t be something I&#39;d necessarily order again.

Service overall was good.    Our server was mostly efficient with getting the meals and eventually getting our tabs settled.    

My first impression of Fiammé earned them a solid 4 rating.   I would come back here next time I&#39;m in the area to check out some of their other offerings."

FINALLY I went last week!  I&#39;m definitely going back.

I actually had to cancel a reservation, and made another and I got super friendly service over the phone every single time!  My friend and I had dinner on a Monday at 6pm...it wasn&#39;t too crowded when we got there, but shortly after it started filling up, so when in doubt, just make a reservation!  

The parking lot is small, but there is street parking nearby and also the parking garages in Downtown Naperville.  

Robin was our server, and was awesome... we went on $20 wine bottle night.  They had some for $20 and some for $30...she suggested when people aren&#39;t sure which to get, they order one for themselves, and take the rest home...they&#39;ll cork it back up for ya!  My friend and I found a $20 reisling we really liked.  For an appetizer we got the burrata - Awesome!  And a lot cheaper (and BETTER) than Neo a few blocks down... We split the Regina Margarita pizza, also very good and got our free dessert with yelp check in.  Quadruple Awesome!

Everything was so great here, I definitely plan on going again...they have a real nice outdoor patio, so probably again in the summer!

I highly recommend this place!"

General info/tips:
The parking lot IS tiny. I was lucky to score a space, but my +1 parked a block away (6:30 on a Saturday). They have valet if you don&#39;t want to chance it nor hoof it.

If you&#39;re dining on a weekend, its probably a good idea to make reservations! I&#39;m glad my +1 thought to, because Fiammé was hoppin&#39;!


Experience and service:
We sat at a hi-top at the bar, and, as conversation is concerned, was a bit too loud for my preference.

Our server was great: attentive, sweet, and personable.. too bad I don&#39;t recall her name, but I know she is allergic to pineapple and hates chocolate, haha.


We ordered:

+ Calimari: 3.5/5
Pretty good, but a little heavy on the breading. It was served plain - no sauces - and was garnished with arugula and cherry tomatoes.

+ Arugula/cherry tomato salad (+ chicken for $3): 3/5
This was more chicken and mozzarella than salad! The greens were VERY sparse! I&#39;d hate to see what it looked like without the chicken and mozzarella.

+ Fiammé pizza: 4/5
Pretty good: love the wood - fired crust that bubbled up in places. It had a good chew. The prosciutto was difficult to bite into, so UNLESS you&#39;re carrying floss with you, I think it&#39;s best to knife + fork it.

+ Sophia Grazia: 3.5/5
Essentially fried dough with powdered chocolate and sauce (chocolate, raspberry, or both) on top. The thing is HUGE and probably best shared with 4+ people! Still, it was a generous Check-In perk!


Fiammé is an example of a &#34;too-bad-Yelp-doesn&#39;t-do-halvsies,&#34; because it would be a 3.5-star experience for me. The great service is what bumps it to a 4. I&#39;d make a return visit to try another pizza and salad - sans chicken this time."

It was just before noon, wasn&#39;t busy but there were people inside. Got seated right away. They put us facing Washington which was nice because my son occupied himself watching cars go by and dancing to the music over the speakers (Pearl Jam and Dave Matthews Band mostly).

Ordered a Moscow Mule (I earned it after surviving the nearby children&#39;s museum) and it was delicious. It came in a small copper mug that kept my drink cold even though my kid kept man-handling it (he enjoys touching condensation on things). 

Food came quickly. I got the Regina Margherita and my son got the children&#39;s sausage pizza. My picture doesn&#39;t do it justice- the kid&#39;s pizza was huge. Six slices. He ate two. The thing about the pizzas is the crust is thin so while the portion is huge knocking back a few slices isn&#39;t going to bust your gut. The kid&#39;s entrees are $7. 

If you have a little who isn&#39;t picky you can probably just share a pizza. They put two different bottles of olive oil on the table. I only tried the regular. It was very good. My 15 month old started dipping his crust in it too.

The two staff members I had contact with were very friendly and attentive. $40 for two of us ($10 of which was my beverage) is a little steep for lunch but worth it for a once in awhile splurge."

Fiamme hits the mark with a great atmosphere, excellent wait staff, and tasty pizza. Is it the best that I have had in the Chicago land area? Well not quite, but that quest continues and Fiamme is most certainly worth your time and money. 

We started with the Regina Marherita which has a mild, but flavorful tomato sauce and plenty of cheese. When paired with the red pepper infused olive oil for a little heat - it is delicious. The Garlic and Artichoke pizza was good but could have used more garlic. 

The beer selection focuses on the small brewers and contains a list of local brews as well as a few imports. The service was excellent across the board and the atmosphere is modern and clean. 

Overall, a very respectable wood-fired pizza restaurant which we will continue to visit."

While they may not have casein free cheese options, they do have a gluten free crust that is one of the best I&#39;ve had in awhile; however, expect to pay a $2 upcharge.


What makes Fiamme a great dining choice:

+ Service - Friendly and extremely helpful. They did a good job answering my questions/concerns about their GF practices

+ Handling of Cross Contamination - They were very careful to eliminate as much CC risk as they could. I am thankful to say that I didn&#39;t get sick as a result 

+ Pizza - Their GF variation was good. The crust didn&#39;t taste like it was GF. It wasn&#39;t overly salty or &#34;cardboardy&#34;. Even when reheated, the crust maintained its consistency, it didn&#39;t become mushy or turn to stone. 

+ The Patio - Loved that on a nice day you can relax on their patio that had umbrellas for each table. There was also a TV on one of the walls to catch the game while you dined

Tips: The quattro formaggie pizza was good; however, if you add the thinly sliced roast beef from the sweet home Chicago pizza, it is the best of two worlds

*While they do have a small private lot in front of the restaurant, you can find free parking along W. Franklin Ave."

We came in at 9 on a saturday night (the earliest they take &#34;reservations&#34;).  The restaurant was full but slowly beginning to empty out.  The hostess was very polite and kept us abreast of an available but maybe too loud table, smartly giving us the option to wait a few moments for another.  A table a little further from the live music opened up and we were promptly seated.

Speaking of that music - it was enjoyable but even for a Saturday night maybe a little too loud.  We couldn&#39;t really hold a conversation at the table and we were 3/4 of the restaurant away.  A little EQ and volume measurement could go a long way, although it does create a little bit of a fun atmosphere.  Nobody&#39;s dancing here, so eating and talkin&#39; are the name of the game though.

There is a pretty decent beer selection here with a couple of favorites - nothing too special but nothing to keep a beer snob away.

Prices at Fiamme are very reasonable, especially considering the wood fired nature of their pizza and the nice space they maintain.

We had the Sweet Home Chicago (italian beef) and the Materdei (lightly fried pepperoni and mushroom).  The Sweet Home was tasty and prepared just right, though when I sat back and thought about that pizza it couldn&#39;t beat an italian beef pizza from Lou Malnati&#39;s.  If wood fired is a must for you it would come out on top though.  The Materdei was tasty but maybe not fried quite enough.  There wasn&#39;t much crispiness to the outside, and reheating it in the oven the next day confirmed (for my palate at least) that a slightly longer cook could have added quite a bit of magic.  I wouldn&#39;t dare say it was bad, but just a little more prep time could have really improved the texture quite a bit.  Flavor of the Materdei was spot on though, and overall both were really good pizzas made with good ingredients.

We also received the check in special - a free Sophia Grazia dessert.  The dish is tasty deep fried dough covered in chocolate and strawberry sauce with powdered sugar.  Simple, sharable, tasty, elegant, and fun.


We didn&#39;t order pasta, but it did sound really good.  I&#39;d definitely give it a chance if you weren&#39;t in a mood for pizza.

For a more casual hangout-type place the bar looked well stocked and the patrons in that area looked like they were having a great time.  It seems like a great place to have a drink with a friend.

I think we&#39;ll be back to Fiamme, but maybe on a more casual weeknight, maybe when the weather warms up and we can enjoy their awesome looking patio seating area."

I thought the food was ok.  We had the burratta, fiamme pizza, Margherita pizza, pollo con carne something it was tonight&#39;s special, and Sophia Gracia dessert. I enjoyed the live music it was kinda loud, but they had a good artist. The burratta platter was good. I liked the fiamme pizza it was much more flavorful then the Margherita pizza. I didn&#39;t like the house special pasta pollo con something lacked sauce and bland.  The dessert was good but we had too much starch already and even though it was free with check in on Yelp we just had to much to finish this.

We were greeted right away and given a booth near the back. The restaurant itself had a steady lunch crowd, but we didn&#39;t feel like it was over crowded.
The menu had a variety of salads from $6-$9. We opted for the market salad, which was pretty good. Balsamic, candied pecans, apples, dried cranberries, and mixed greens. $9 and it was enough for 2 of us.

I am gluten free, so I ended up choosing a GF crust which was $2 extra. My friend ordered a traditional crust pizza which looked very tasty. My pizza was a form of a Margherita pizza with buffalo mozzarella, basil, and tomatoes. $16 for the pizza + GF crust. The restaurant serves two varieties of olive oil from a local olive store &#34;Twisted Olive&#34;. My ultra thin crust was fantastic dipped into a little of the plain olive oil.  My friend tried the oil with red pepper in it.

Overall, the service was great and the food was also delicious. You won&#39;t get the $5.00 Pizza Hut prices, but you also won&#39;t have the screaming kids and balloons.
Salad + 2 pizzas ended up being under $45. Enough pizza to feed 4 adults. I took mine home for a late night snack.

Wow! Both were simply mouthwatering. That buratta was delicious - it was a blend of soft Italian cheeses wrapped in buratta plus crispy toasts and greens on the side. It was a delicious combination of flavors that seemed to change to a buttery liquid that made your mouth and throat accept them with love.

The pasta and sausage was just the right amount of pasta, sauce and a bit spicy sausage. We were splitting it and could not finish it.

Because we had checked in on Yelp, we got a free dessert. They were crispy dough with chocolate and powdered sugar. Again, we could not finish them.

We split both dishes, got the free dessert, split the bill while adding tip for the freebie and it was 20.00 apiece. Super cheap, delicious and filling.

Burrata - If you&#39;ve never had burrata, think stuffed mozzarella cheese! It&#39;s got a thin layer of mozzarella and inside it&#39;s a creamy Italian cheese that&#39;s perfect for spreading. The appetizer comes with a side of tomato jam (yum!), prosciutto, and crostini. They&#39;re also willing to bring more crostini if you run out ;)

Bruschetta ricotta mozzarella - After having many types of bruschetta, I&#39;ve love ones that come with some sort of cheese spread, which this one does! Everything comes deconstructed, so you can build your own crostini!

Prosciutto &amp; arugula - Those who love Neapolitan pizzas typically love prosciutto and arugula pizzas. it&#39;s like my go-to determination on if I like a place&#39;s pizza or not. They do their pizza very well....nice crispy crust with a good balance of meat, cheese, arugula and parmigiana.

The food was great, and let me tell you that they offer generous portions (we were 4 and for appetizer we shared the burrata with crostini-delicious- and for dessert we had the Sophia Grazia, something similar to a funnel cake which was delicious too, both plates were more than enough for the 4 of us). I highly recommend... everything! Since we&#39;ve tried sandwiches, pizza, and pasta; seriously, everything was very well made and tasty. Our waitress was super nice and attentive. We went with our friend&#39;s little dog(a Frenchie) and everybody was in love with him. They provided him with a big bowl of fresh water. Great experience!"

Was here with a group of yelpers recently on a weeknight. The subject was the wood oven pizza. They did have some decent pie. Nice atmosphere, &amp; $5 drink specials. Ive come to decide that the bottom crust was too soft for my liking, though the ingredients were fresh. Service was decent, the noise level was a bit overwhelming however. Still all in all, Id consider returning."

Everything I have tried has been so good, from the gnocchi to the various pasta&#39;s, to the Neapolitan style pizza. FYI  It&#39;s brick oven style pizza with a chewy crust that has that little bit of oven soot on it that makes you know that it is real deal.  It&#39;s not going to be a crunchy crust because that is not what they do in Naples (known as Napoli in Italian which is where Neapolitan style pizza comes from) The wines here are fantastic and the service is exceptional. I brought my whole family of 7 here and we sat outside and there was a guy singing Sinatra all night.  It was very relaxing and I nailed impressing the family! Ambiance, drink, food.  Worth every penny! I would recommend doing a pasta and a pizza and splitting half and half with someone. It&#39;s the way to go!"

We sat outside, and the place looks nice but here are the issues:
Most servers were ladies, with their hair down, all black outfits and really unprofessional looking. Their uniforms were mostly covered in flour, shirts not tucked in.... just very and i mean very casual and not really a restaurant environment appropriate. I understand its no 5 star Steakhouse, but #1 rule in in all food serving establishments should be &#34;server&#39;s hair needs to be in a pony tail&#34;
Our server was sweet, dark long hair, but she didn&#39;t write down what we ordered, so I never got my lemon that I asked with Water, nor did my husband get his coke, that he asked be served with his pizza.
There also was no drink menu. You had to ask for one, which is kind of strange.

We ordered two pizzas and they were blah. My funghi came with probably canned mushrooms, as the juice was everywhere and it was nasty. Mushrooms tasted crappy. The cheese had no taste.... it was not salty enough (and I dont like salty food) but this was not salty at all.  I ended up taking all the mushrooms off, and just eating the crust, basically. 
When the server moved our plates, she never asked why I have 3/4 of my pizza left and all the mushrooms are off, and I dont want to take it home...... you would think they would be trained to ask.

Anyways, not a place I would be going back to...."

Getting in, parking was a little hard, they do offer valet but we got lucky with street parking. Plan on having to valet or walk from the parking garage though, the lot is small.

We had made reservations fortunately, the place was really busy. When we first walked in, it was a little confusing because there&#39;s no hostess stand so we weren&#39;t really sure where to go. Stood there only about 30 seconds before someone greeted us and walked us to our table.  

Only waited about a minute before our waitress greeted us and she still apologized for the wait. Great customer service! 

We ordered a few drinks while we were there. I had a white peach Manhattan and a pineapple martini. Both were very good! My date had a New Old Fashioned which he loved too. 

We ordered calamari to start. Not kidding it was probably the best calamari I&#39;ve ever had. Not greasy and the flavors were perfect. It comes with tomatoes and greens. Delicious. 

For dinner we shared the Fiamme pizza. So so good! Great flavor once again and they give you a couple different oils you can pour over it. Regular Virgin olive oil and another w red pepper in it. I loved it. 

I was pleasantly surprised with this place! Honestly, I&#39;m never a fan of live music at a restaurant and with this place being a little smaller it did seem a bit loud but the guy singing was good and we were still able to carry on a conversation and our fellow diners loved him so I really can&#39;t complain. Just personal preference.

If you&#39;re in the mood for delicious, authentic pizza you should go here. At one point I think I said &#34;I feel like I could be eating in Italy.&#34; It was good!"

The food was absolutely phenomenal. The calamari had excellent flavor without being over powering, was lightly breaded and cooked perfect. Pairing it with the arugula and cherry tomatoes just made it that much more delicious. There was nothing left. Our pizza, De Leon, was sauceless with buffalo mozzarella, arugula  (that they did an excellent job of wilting before hand, not just putting lettuce on food), roasted tomatoes,  and fennel sausage. It was so good. It wasn&#39;t too intense, had a great flavor, and the crust was just amazing (i was dipping it in some of the table olive oil). The pizzas are wood fire roasted, which is the way to go. Our dessert, which i sadly cannot remember the name of, was awesome. Fried dough topped with powdered sugar and chocolate and raspberry sauces. It wasn&#39;t too sweet like a funnel cake, it was just the right amount of sweetness with a more simple dough. I still can&#39;t believe we ate almost all of it. I was so full i couldn&#39;t eat anything the rest of the day! :)

I enjoyed a glass, or 2, of grigio while he enjoyed the bloody special. 

Our server, briana, turned out to be the bartender,  and she was very cool. I love someone who is a little more personable and she was very down to earth. She greeted us promptly, but we have to read every single part of every menu, so we needed some time. She felt that she toke too long to come back the second time, which we were plenty ok, to take our order. She must have apologized a million times and ended up buying us a round of drinks. Always very appreciated, and we made sure to take care of her. As the bartender she was clearly helping out with tables until some servers arrived, being in the industry i can completely understand.  She still made it a fantastic experience,  much more than we were expecting from our late lunch. Her great service, and the amazing food, will definitely be a calling back.

I&#39;ve also seen some reviews complaining about the parking lot. They offer free valet, so stop complaining, you actually don&#39;t have to park in the garage and walk like every other place downtown. 
Make this your stop before any other."

I&#39;ve been to Fiamme a handful of times now, and I ALWAYS have a great time! Love the atmosphere, love the staff, and of course the food is fantastic.

I highly recommend the following (although I&#39;ve honestly never had a bad dish here!):
- Bruschetta Ricotta Mozzarella
- Calamari
- Sausage Rigatoni
- Fiamme pizza
- Prosciutto &amp; Arugula pizza

On Thursday, Fridays, and Saturday nights (in warm weather) they have live music on the patio! Such a fun spot for a date night or dinner &amp; drinks with friends. Last time was there on a Thursday their drink special was $5 martinis which I&#39;m always game for. The martini I ordered had an edible flower decoration in it! Super cool. Their wine list is fantastic as well. I suggest tapping into the Fiamme staff&#39;s wine knowledge - they know their stuff!

I would honestly give Fiamme 5 starts, however I can help but compare it to my absolute favorite restaurant Frasca Pizzeria &amp; Wine Bar. They&#39;re very similiar in nature, but at the end of the day I honestly feel Frasca comes out on top. That&#39;s in the city though, so for my &#39;burbs fix you best believe I&#39;ll be dining at Fiamme!"

It includes salami, pepperoni, two types of cheese and a nice garnish.  This is a big appetizer for two but could be a nice sampler for a party of 3 or 4.
For our main course, we ordered Regina Margherita and Funghi pizzas.  As you can tell from numerous previous reviews, their pizza is in the Neopolitan brick-oven style.  The crust is done perfectly and they nailed the baking time since the inner core was not soggy but yet the crust was not burned.
In terms of our individual pizzas, the Funghi was much more flavorful than the Margherita.  The Margherita had high quality ingredients like fresh tomatoes and buffo mozzarella but frankly, there wasn&#39;t enough covering the pizza. It was also lacking in spices.  I can easily recommend the Funghi but was not impressed with the Regina Margherita.
Ordering wine at Fiamme is not a particularly good value.  They serve their wine in tiny carafes.  I&#39;m not sure what these pours measure out to but it doesn&#39;t appear to be very much.  Stick with beer.
Fiamme is A-OK for good Neopolitan style pizza"

The exterior is well thought out. Elegant strings of tea lights create a pseudo-canapy over the outdoor eating area, and torches and lamps create the romantic-dim lighting ambience. There is a private lot for this restaurant so no need to park on the street or in a garage (though both options are still free).

Walking in: Lovely brick and dark walnut interior. Bar area is immediately on the right. The entire 3/4 left of the restaurant is indoor seating. A pleasant hostess asked us if we would like to sit indoor or outdoor. We opted for outdoor, and since the restaurant was at basically full capacity (empty seating in bar area, which we didn&#39;t opt for), she told us to wait a few minutes so they could set up our table. 

Service:  Minus 1-1.5 stars. Slightly unreasonable wait for our waitress to came over and ask us what we wanted to drink. I just wanted a lemon wedge for my water. Had to ask twice for the lemon, and didn&#39;t get it until I was half way through my entree. Waitress was aloof, stoic and was either nowhere to be found, or really really late. She asked us how our meals were tasting when we were almost 4/5th of the way done with our dishes. I actually had to tell the waitress &#34;I would like to order the Sophia Grazie for dessert&#34; since we were not asked if we would like to look at a dessert menu. So mind you the dessert I ordered was from memory since it was a yelp check in offer. We were never actually offered a dessert menu or even asked if we wanted dessert. And we definitely were never asked if we wanted coffee after our meal (an absolute must ask question at an Italian eatery!) Took about 15 minutes between when we gave our card for the check for us to get back the signed copy. 

Food: Regina Margherita pizza, the Sweet Home Chicago pizza, the Tortellini Ricotta and the Sophia Grazie. Despite the table&#39;s having Eventually bread came but our waitress said &#34;the oils are actually for the pizza&#34;. One, not sure how she intended her statement to come out, but it sounded snarky. Two, I do feel that either customers should be told this before hand/given bread, or don&#39;t bring out the olive oils with the customers drinks. It makes it seems like we&#39;re waiting for bread as an antipasti. I mean its an Italian eatery, of course we&#39;re expecting bread. 

A) Regina Margherita: I give this a 3.5/5. Bufala mozzarella, oven roasted tomatoes and fresh basil. Except, their sauce does not seem like it was made in house. WHICH is not a problem, but it shouldn&#39;t blatantly taste like it came out of a can. 

B) Sweet Home Chicago Pizza: Rating this a 4/5. A homage to its location this is a white pizza (no sauce). Thin slices of italian beef, giardiniera peppers, fresh mozzarella. I was definitely a fan of this, and found myself folding the pizza in half NY style to eat it like an italian beef sandwich haha!

C) Tortellini Ricotta: Rating this a 4/5. 3 cheese stuffed, a house made garlic-parmigiano sauce that was perfectly creamy. Ideal amount of spinach, and it came out piping hot. The mushrooms in this dish were a little too thick, too much and didn&#39;t tie in the dish together as a whole. If they used thinner slices, used less, and a different type of mushroom I would have given this a 5/5. 

D) Sophia Grazie: 2/5! Only got this because it&#39;s free if you check in on yelp; but NOT worth it! At first glance you get really excited because this dish is HUGE. Its about 1-2 dozen pillowy soft strips of fried dough drizzled with chocolate syrup and sprinkled with powdered sugar. By sheer size alone this would be good to share with 4 people. It also comes out PIPING hot. 3 bites in it becomes apparent that this dessert is created from leftover pizza dough nearing the end of it&#39;s shelf life. The dough has the same taste as pizza crust. Neither sweet or savory. It&#39;s bland, slightly salty with hints of baking powder/soda. Chocolate drizzle tasted like a slightly diluted version of hershey&#39;s syrup. 

Interesting Tidbits:

1) Restaurant is owned by a local Naperville family.

2) The oven that they use for their pizza is actually imported directly from Italy. Theres a specific family in Italy that makes Neopolitana pizza ovens; their oven is from them. 

3) The olive oils (traditional and chili-fied) are from Twisted Olive; a local Oil company in downtown Naperville. I highly recommend going there. Their balsamic is to die for. 



TL;DR: 1-1.5 stars off for service, 1 star off for food. Cute interior/exterior. No gratis bread comes with the meal, you must ask for it and you will only get a few small slices per person. Skip the Regina Margherita (sauce tasted canned), and the Sophia Grazie (even though its a free yelp deal). Tortellini Ricotta was good, but mushrooms type used is sub-par. If you&#39;re looking for Nepolitana style Pizza in the area go to Neo instead (less than 1/2 a mile away)."

I went with my husband and my two daughters and we were all disappointed. We arrived at 5:30 on a Friday and already they were crowded. Half the restaurant had open tables but we were told all were reserved. We ordered the antipasto appetizer which in my opinion was the best part of the entire meal. It wasn&#39;t outstanding, but it was definitely good enough. And then the pizzas came. After taking a couple of bites I couldn&#39;t for the life of me understand why there were so many people already here and so many more waiting to get in. I ordered the prosciutto and arugula pizza. It was covered with so much arugula that you couldn&#39;t immediately tell that the ingredients only went half to three quarters up the pizza. It was a tasty pizza but for $15 I expected way more ingredients. My daughters both ordered sausage, one from the adult menu and one from the children&#39;s menu. They had maybe four pieces of sausage each total and we&#39;re talking small pieces. They were also incredibly skimpy with the cheese. My husband&#39;s pizza was the worst yet. It was a roasted garlic pizza, but it didn&#39;t have sauce and most of the roasted garlic was concentrated in the center of the pizza so he was left with what seemed like $15 worth of dry bread. All of the pizzas were lacking in ingredients and cheese in my opinion. I don&#39;t know how they could pass them off for $15. We were looking forward to a good meal and instead ended up spending $80 on pizza worse than Domino&#39;s."

I really wanted to like this place. Really.  We had reservations for 7:15 and we were seated immediately.  No one came to our table for 10 minutes.  One server did a flyby saying she would bring water and she never returned.  The server who did stop didn&#39;t introduce herself, didn&#39;t welcome us; just said we looked like we needed help.  Did we look like lost hikers in the woods??  Drinks took another 10 minutes after that.   

When making the reservation, I told the hostess there was a child in the group.  A Children&#39;s menu was not brought to the table when we were seated.  I had to ask for one,  twice.  It took a total of 25 minutes to get one.  When she finally brought it,  my daughter insisted we order immediately, thinking the waitress would disappear again.  So, my very hungry 8 year old son found something quickly and we ordered.  By the time our appetizer came to the the table, we had been sitting for 45 minutes. 

In the meantime my blood sugar is plummeting (I&#39;m a T1 diabetic). Due to the lack of service and food,  my husband had to run to the bar for a soda before I crashed completely.  Crisis averted.

The food was nothing special.  I had hoped that the food would redeem them for the horrible wait.  Unfortunately, it didn&#39;t.  The best part of the meal was the olive oil from The Twisted Olive which you can find at 232 Washington St. 

The calamari appetizer has been repeating itself for over 2 hours now.  Ugg.  

My husband and I shared the roasted vegetable pizza.  Had they not drown it in balsamic, I believe it would have been much better.  I ended up scraping everything off the pizza and dipped the crust in the previously mentioned olive oil.  

My daughter ordered the ricotta tortellini.  She said it was just bland.  She tried every bit of culinary magic she could come up with to doctor that dish.  She added oil, salt and pepper.  Nothing would make it better.  

My older son had the short rib ravioli.  He said it was so-so but, ate all of it out of sheer hunger.

The youngest, being 8, ordered Mac n Cheese with a side of fries.  The fries weren&#39;t hot.  To me, they tasted old. He did eat all of them, smothered in ketchup of course.  He ate about three spoonfuls of Mac and Cheese and refused to eat the rest.  I tried it.  Not good.  I added salt, still not good.  

In tonight&#39;s traffic, it took us almost an hour to get there.  For a good meal, I will drive an hour or more.  Yet,  I can&#39;t find one strong reason to make the drive back there.

Service earned 1 star.  Food earned two stars.  My overall recommendation is 1.5 stars."
