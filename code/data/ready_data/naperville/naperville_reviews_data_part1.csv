I should say we have only been there one time for this meal, but the service was good, the quality was good, and the quantity was more than adequate. I found it to be a very enjoyable meal.However my previous reviews on the other menu items, remain as stated.I think the menu is 5 times larger than it should be, and I think that the owner would do better training his cooks to prepare a few meals well, rather than to assemble many, many Items poorly.On another note, he has recently added a very large, a very bright; almost blinding, sign that when traveling past it at night, is annoying and almost dangerous.I think that the owner would have done far better to use that money on hiring a consultant to downsize &amp; improve his menu."riverview-diner-montgomery,Alex A.,z4lemVkxHcm2QlwSi904fA,"Aurora, IL",0,1,1,0,133,ca0oz2Q7_HorQuwrraKsFA,3,02/10/16,Over all this place is pretty good.

The new building is really nice and very comfortable and clean. Even though they were slammed for Sunday brunch, we were quickly seated. The bussers were fast and attentive, presenting us with cups of coffee and water immediately and keeping both topped off. Our server came and took our order quickly, but we never saw her again until she dropped off the check. If it weren&#39;t for the bussers, we would have been parched through our meal.The food was better than average, but nothing particularly special. My wife and I agreed that we have had better pancakes, although these were good. The portions were sizable, but they should have been, since our bill was $29 for my wife&#39;s pancakes, bacon, and juice and my eggs, bacon, hash browns and coffee.Not a bad experience, but with all the other choices out there, the folks here might consider stepping up their game a bit, at least in the wait-staff department.

Friday&#39;s a fish fry heaven for those who look for a chuckload of fried favorites. Really good homey and traditional cabin dining feel plus you got a view of the fox river.They serve breakfast the entire day and the price are very reasonable. Tried majority of the skillet combinations and they&#39;re very good. Just don&#39;t order for the pasta dishes since majority of the staff and maybe the cook are latinos unless you want your spaghetti tasting like salsa and taco spices. Eveything else is awesome though and did I say free dessert choices for any dinner orders (go for the pies)? Friday&#39;s are FishFry AYCE. I can only have enough fish and chips per meal, but you could substitute for a mash/bake potatoes if you want to mix it up. Some of the choices are cod, walleye, and perch. You can&#39;t switch to a different fish for every plate though and would need to stick with cod if you initially ordered cod. My personal favorite is perch, I find it more flavorful and lightly breaded. The broasted chicken is also a must try. Enough balance of crunch and moist on the chicken to go along with the mashed potatoes, the veggies are a little overcooked and not lightly steamed as I would prefer it.The service is fast and they&#39;re very attentive to order details. Everyone&#39;s very friendly, like every knew each other. One time we accidentally left my son&#39;s ipad and they found it while cleaning up our table. The hostess kept it safe and I got it after an hour when in most cases it won&#39;t be returned. Kudos to your honest staff.

The Eggs Benedict was off - the Canadian Bacon seemed like it came from a tin can and the poached eggs were tiny.

This place has good reviews. And I will start off by saying I&#39;ve only been here once, and I had dinner. I have not tried their breakfast or lunch. So I am reviewing solely based on my dinner experience there. I was feeling like comfort food on a Monday night, so my hubby suggested we go to Riverview since it is right down the road from our house. We had not tried it since their renovation, so we figured we were due. I ordered the meatloaf, because I am a huge fan of meatloaf and I consider it my go-to comfort food. When I think of good meatloaf, I picture moist, well-cooked meat that has a little crispiness on top and then the meat is juicy on the inside. This was not at ALL what I got. I got a huge plate that looked anything but appetizing and was DRENCHED in gravy. This did not look like sliced meatloaf either. The meat looked like brown sponges, like a cafeteria mystery-meat. Still, I decided to not just go off of how disgusting it looked and actually try it. Well that didn&#39;t help either. It had a frozen taste to it big time. I&#39;ve had On-Cor frozen dinner meatloaf that tasted better than this. To top it off, half the plate had flavorless peas to accompany the meatloaf, and a pretty tiny scoop of mashed potatoes that were also sub-par.My husband ordered a Fettuccine Alfredo. Again, I get this is not a fancy Italian place so he wasn&#39;t expecting gourmet. Just some good pasta with some good sauce at a good price. The price was ok, however, the sauce was not creamy at all. It was so runny and bland. Again, I don&#39;t know if this is sauce from a jar, if it is made there, or if it&#39;s frozen. What I can say is that it was not good and please no one order this. We were so upset because we both wanted to eat some comfort food in this nice diner (which by the way is VERY nice on the inside) but all we got were meat sponges and watery noodles. I could have made all of this at home, spent way less, and had food that actually had quality to it. And also keep in mind when it comes to being a picky eater, well my husband and I pretty much love ALL food. Like seriously, it&#39;s really hard for us to think something is bad.I guess perhaps they need to bring their dinner menu to a reasonable amount of choices, and make those fresh and delicious. Their dinner menu is pretty huge (they even have Chinese food, seriously?) There&#39;s no reason I should go out and spend almost $30 for a dinner for two just to eat frozen, poorly made food."riverview-diner-montgomery,W K.,kgqL8HwkAHq2R2uXrm4JJA,"Denver, CO",0,1,0,0,1,XxT5IFra_zHDugTe8A2S9w,1,29/04/16,Stopped here while on business travel based on other Yelp! reviews. My business associate and I stopped in about 11:30. He ordered a breakfast plate and I had a lunch plate. Both of us were happy with our meals. Is it a classy Five Star Gourmet restaurant?

Don&#39;t be fooled, they call themselves a diner, but there is nothing &#34;diner-ish&#34; about this place. It is a family restaurant through and through. But we love those so we still ate. Sunday afternoon, packed, which was a good sign.First thing I noticed was how much real estate was wasted in here. They could easily fit a handful more tables and booths to ease with the wait times, and the counter (which has about 7 seats) was not being used. Why not? 15 people were waiting for a place to sit.Prices are fairly steep, and this is the first time I&#39;ve ever had to pay to get fries with a burger.Speaking of, I got the &#34;Island Burger.&#34; Which they say is &#34;smothered&#34; in thousand island dressing. Sign me up! Turns out &#34;smothered&#34; here means 1/4 of my bun was lightly patted with dressing. How disappointing. Burger was average, fries were pretty good. The creamy chicken and rice soup was very good.Before we got our food, we were planning to travel here again to try the breakfast, now we will pass."riverview-diner-montgomery,Gerald S.,i5opYDTlxc0ufxe_oU4ZLw,"Aurora, IL",0,1,0,0,34,WllkJ90NfSJ6AAKc2XTLvw,2,20/08/16,"Received Horrible Service this morning. I have eaten there many times and went there this morning with family from out of town. I informed server my allergy to eggs and asked to substitute for a cup of grits Â (which I did many times before with no problem ), however they refused today stating that the request was made to the manager and that he denied it. When I asked to speak with manager, I was then told that there was actually no manager on duty, but that they would allow a subtitution for a dollar more (Really)when the grits were actually Â cheaper. We are Â minority family of six adults. We cancelled our order and went elsewhere. Â I felt as though we were treated like second class citizens and we would Never dine there again.

Food was fine, seemed like the egg portions have gotten smaller tho. Â Our waitress is the reason for the 3 stars, she had a voice that was rather annoying.

Heaven forbid if we had a problem with our food since our server didn&#39;t even bother to come back around and ask us how everything was.

Its really hard for me to write this review because this was my favorite place to eat and now I don&#39;t think I will ever go back, seriously. They moved to a new building which is very beautiful but seems to have affected their food. Although the service is still great. I took my family out to eat which was about 8 of us. No one was really happy with their food but of course it was breakfast so we ate it and just decided not to go back. The home fries are cooked weird now, they are very hard on the outside and potatoes just aren&#39;t done on the inside. The pancakes that use to be amazing have changed and now they aren&#39;t as good, not nasty, just not that good. My brother asked for medium over easy eggs and he says they were barely cooked and he could barely eat them. I even stopped ordering my favorite chorizo frittata because the potatoes were hard inside and it just wasn&#39;t good and it was too expensive to order it and not eat. Im not sure if their griddle is messed up because the time before this we went they were having problems with their griddle so we gave them a pass on the food that wasn&#39;t very good, although they didn&#39;t offer a discount. I wish I was comfortable enough to complain but im just not which is why I wont go back. I can&#39;t help but wonder if other loyal customers feel this way. I use to come here almost every week. Sad to think I wont be going back. Oh well.p.s.

I know having omelettes so huge they&#39;re practically falling off the plate is a selling point in 2014&#39;s America... But for those of us with a normal body mass index, I wish I could pay less and just get a normal amount of food. This seems to be a common problem across most (all?) midwestern diners.The reviews on the lower end of the spectrum are pretty on point with what I&#39;ve experienced. When you&#39;re making omelettes this huge, you&#39;ve got to overcook them. It&#39;s simple physics, as to get the inside of a 6&#34; wide omelette cooked you&#39;re going to have to overcook most of the outside. Again, back to normal sized food, and being able to cook it, well, normally.I&#39;ve never tried anything outside of the breakfast menu, but know this is the kind of place that has EVERYTHING. Want some Chinese? They got it. Pasta? Got it. Seafood? Got it. This might contribute to why everything is so resoundingly mediocre, as how do you be a restaurant that has great stir fry, pasta, breakfast, steaks, salads, and more? If a chef exists that can knock each of those respective cuisines out of the park, chances are they wouldn&#39;t be working at a converted Pizza Hut in Aurora.You can tell the clientele who go here truly don&#39;t care about this kind of stuff as they just want two days worth of food for a small amount of money.

Anyway, I use a standard entree that I love to gauge these types of restaurants against each other--- BLT club. I have probably had this choice maybe 6 times at this place and every time--- it is just flat-out delicious. Fries are perfect (great, traditional fries--not the &#39;double-crispy&#39; ones that a lot of restaurants have gone to for some reason that I HATE!) and always very hot &amp; fresh and the soups are equally tasty. As I said, breakfast&#39;s are always done very well and the only negative I could come up with here is that they only offer canned corned beef. But most places like this don&#39;t make fresh corned beef and I don&#39;t hold that against them since when you ask, at least the servers have always been honest about it &amp; tell you flat out---which is a major plus in my evaluations of places. You want fresh-made corned beef, you have to go to specialty restaurants like Walker Brothers up in northern Chicagoland or Buttermilk in Geneva--- which excel at their homemade corned beef.For this type of diner-type restaurant, I highly recommend giving Riverview a try as I&#39;ve always been pleased when leaving after a meal here"riverview-diner-montgomery,Dave R.,cTWExirAvsYfSc3fSXZQmQ,"Montgomery, IL",0,1,0,0,143,KuVniLJLXmE8w5lEvnLjCQ,4,22/08/15,I gave them a second chance thinking they may have grown into their new building by now.

It would be ok to raise the price $1 or 2 for fresh vegetables. Also for the server to offer the horseradish sauce. I had to go to the front to request it. The place was half full and moderately busy. However, there were 3 servers and 2 other staff members/managers. Rounds for water, coffee, and checking up on customers was minimal. If the owner/manager can get their staff to be a bit more proactive, with a couple tweaks, this place will have a 5 star rating when I return in 4-5 months. Along with the new addition they are building, I have great expectations for them if they can get all of their staff up to speed with proactivity.

We stopped in around 8pm Friday night, and it was packed! Mostly families and older folks which, to me, is a good sign. We were seated promptly and presented with an enormous menu - American, Chinese, Italian, and Mexican - oh my! Lots of tempting choices, but we were on a mission: All you can eat! We settled on broasted chicken (not all you can eat) and fried cod (AYCE). After a short wait, our massive portions arrived and all convos ceased - we meant business. I tore into the chicken which had crispy, flavorful skin with juicy white meat. My fries were standard fare, but delicious nonetheless. The cod came with homemade chips, and was replenished until we just couldn&#39;t take anymore. Dinner was followed up by rice pudding that was warm, fresh and sprinkled with a perfect dusting of nutmeg. Full stomachs, leftovers in tow, our check came to $22! Riverview is completely non-glamorous, but I&#39;m giving it &#39;5&#39; stars for the family vibe, tons of choices, solid food and unbeatable prices - but mostly for the feeling you get while you&#39;re there - it&#39;s a true community place - and those are hard to come by these days."riverview-diner-montgomery,Ashley R.,zPr7Ha_w53UJf-bP0HAhpQ,"Montgomery, IL",0,1,1,7,31,CHwT_Qv3Ol7nz81hY_uHOw,5,01/08/11,"It has a very comfortable atmosphere when you walk in, a very small town type of feel.

We waited only a couple minutes to be seated. The waiting area is a little tight so I imagine it gets hectic when they&#39;re busy. Luckily, we were one of three tables so it was fairly empty at the time.Upon sitting down, I was overwhelmed by the decor. Business cards of local establishments checker the table beneath glass, so at least you have something to look at, albeit they&#39;re mostly cheesy real estate agents. I believe the wallpaper border was palm trees so that was a little weird but I doubt people are going here for ambiance.The menu is extensive, Chinese food, Italian food, breakfast served any time, melts, salads...everything. I ordered a salad of some sort which consisted of onions, tomatoes, cucumbers, green peppers and feta in some sort of vinaigrette (note: no lettuce), easy on the feta and my bf ordered a burger and fries. The food came out promptly, which is good because there were only two other tables occupied in the place. The server was not really attentive, as I mentioned to my bf that I was going to get up to ask for water..twice before she came back, and I didn&#39;t have a fork, but she was nice and kindness goes far in my book.My bf said the burger was decent, not the best but pretty good and large in size. I ate two of his fries and they were delicious, crisp and golden. My salad was good, the portion was large and I had leftovers BUT the onion was out of control. Like I love onions, and as a child used to eat onion and cheese sandwiches with my grandpa (gross, I know) but this was nuts. I tried to go easy on the consumption bc I felt really bad about my bf having to deal with the dragon breath but it was far too late. By the time we arrived at our destination in the other side of Montgomery (aka 5 minutes later), I was in a stage of deep and sorrowful regret, feverishly brushing my teeth.Overall, I&#39;d like to go back and try breakfast but I feel my average review is most likely a result of my tendency to eat the healthier fare at some of these greasy spoon diners.

Inside are a few tables, some stools and a couple of outside tables with umbrellas.In visiting Johnny&#39;s Red Hots I decided to try the hot dog with fries. The hot dog I received came on a plain non-poppy seed buns. This seems to be more of a minimalist style dog as it did not include tomato, hot peppers or celery salt that I could detect. It did however feature a thinly cut pickle, however the pickle was not as long as the hot dog so you didn&#39;t get pickle in every bite. The bun was soft but didn&#39;t appear to be steamed very long, the hot dog itself was fine and had a nice juicy flavor to it. The application of mustard, onions and relish were fine, but the brand of relish used was not the neon-green type found at most hot dog joints and gave off more of a sour flavor.On the plus side the fries I received complimented the hot dog well and had a nice crisp outside and a nice potato flavor inside. They weren&#39;t too salty or too plain, these were excellent tasting fries.Overall Johnny&#39;s is a decent place to get a hot dog.

Â The place was busy when we arrived but was not at all by this point. Â We also had to ask for our tab twice and it came back incorrect, charged full prices for things on special.Avoid the pulled pork unless you really love the taste of horrible slaw since this was the only detectable flavor despite a significant amount of some kind of BBQ. Â I was actually entirely unaware the sandwich was coming with slaw since it&#39;s only mentioned on the primary menu not the specials menu from which I ordered. Â The manager eventually took the inedible item off the bill for us but not before trying to buy us off with $5 off purchase of $25 or more coupons that aren&#39;t usable is the customer purchases anything on the specials menu. Â We explained we aren&#39;t locals and have an almost non existent chance of coming back and he just looked at with a dumb expression before apologizing and walking away.Last but not least if you value your ear drums do not go here.

Â The thought of a slice of bacon dangling over your drinks was enough to get me to order a few of those. Â The Pickle Piggy takes a strong love of pickle juice and bacon flavor vodka to chug this one down. Â Then there was a Maple Bacon Donut Shot...that was tasty.Now, what also impressed me was the CRAFT beer selection!!! Large selection on tap and bottled.

Need I say more. Mmmm hmm.&#34;Bear Down&#34; Burger - Bacon, Fried Onions, Cheese and whiskey BBQ sauce.All of the items hit the spot.

All were pretty tasty and well-done.The potato croquettes are a delicious little tater tot variation, and my opinion of the nachos has improved, too; the beef was juicier the second time and there was plenty of gooey cheese sauce. I also kind of like having the pico, sour cream and guacamole on the side (good guacamole too).I do wish they had some booths or normal tables/chairs, I feel awkward perched at a high top on a stool (no back or anything) but I&#39;ll forgive them because they really are aiming for &#34;basic sports bar with good food&#34; as opposed to gastropub or anything like that."overtime-bar-and-grill-lombard,Andy S.,g4r8eIihK8cu0sOThENy1w,"Lombard, IL",0,1,0,3,6,5cvqisnKeSDWiEh3h4uq-g,4,01/06/15,Not rating food drinks or service but my God why would you allow karaoke on a weekend night?

With some ice cream (I think) and whipped cream and good sized pieces of crunchy bacon. Â And some chocolate sauce. Maybe something else, too, but I can&#39;t tell you because I just go into a trance when I eat this, it is that good. A major sugar rush, along with the saltiness of bacon and the sweetness and fudginess of the brownie. Â I just can&#39;t think straight when I eat it. YUM!- bacon wrapped mozzarella sticks - these are really good. Just typical mozz sticks but wrapped tightly in bacon. How can you go wrong? Wish they would have brought marinara instead of ranch, but maybe the guy who ordered them asked for the ranch instead - not sure.- bacon croquettes - OMG, these are a heart attack in a dish, but you will die happy. Good sized deep fried balls of mashed potatoes topped with plenty of sour cream, ranch and bacon. These were really good.So, would I recommend it? Yes. In fact, I know it is a bar, but I think my almost 17 yr old son would love the bacon stuff and the brownie, so I&#39;m considering taking him here for lunch one day. Â It is just that good. Â And bonus? There are no women servers running around in cut off shirts, tight shorts, with their bodies exposed. Or wearing mock kilts. Â Sorry, you other two bars know who you are - let&#39;s leave it at that. I can bring my son here and I don&#39;t feel like we will need to have a discussion with him about why they are dressed like that when I leave. (yes, I made the mistake of taking him to the other place when he was very young hoping he wouldn&#39;t pay attention and he asked me why the waitresses were all just wearing their underwear. Â Needless to say, we didn&#39;t go back no matter how good their seasoned fries and ranch were) Thank you Overtime for giving me a place to go where the food is good and I could actually bring my son during the less busy hours if I wanted to for a good meal. (And no, I wouldn&#39;t be drinking if I did that, for all you people who are going to start criticizing me for doing that - I would be coming for the food. Â To those people - Lighten up people.)"overtime-bar-and-grill-lombard,Abby P.,00uP1ORfMu-wOayHLBqqwA,"Lombard, IL",0,1,1,2,49,H1YSBJgNMRNQp5PpXMQdvQ,5,19/03/15,Awesome drink specials!

Â Tried the Parmesan garlic and sweet &amp; hot. Absolutely enjoyed the parm garlic; perfect temperature, plenty meaty, crispy breading, scrumptious garlic sauce, faultlessly moist chicken, and shredded parm coating was icing on the cake. Sweet &amp; hot were great too, but #1 goes to the garlic. Regrettably, the beer selection wasn&#39;t as advertised. Hardly what I would even consider a mediocre craft beer selection; however advantageous prices made up for the lacking in variety. Food came out quick, but overall service left something to be desired. Stopping in on a Sunday was the right move, as .50 cent wings and $2.00 domestics supplanted certain local tap deficiencies. All-in-all, a decent local sports bar putting out some great wings, bar food, and draft beer...just don&#39;t expect much more than that."overtime-bar-and-grill-lombard,Erin M.,O9Rbwl_XkTeB8sykYr69dw,"Lombard, IL",0,1,0,0,649,Hv5djJjD9qXsAqHkIr8cmw,3,14/02/15,"Time OutThis place is great.

I know she has worked elsewhere in the area just not sure where but I do remember her as a great beer slinger, not just a pretty face. She sure didn&#39;t let up on the gas pedal of quality service at the Overtime. I truly appreciate her work ethic as well as the the bearded chef bouncing out wonderful bar dishes with speed, taste, and pride. Plenty of TV&#39;s and an aura of localtiy. My only concern here was the retread of patrons that belly up from bar to bar...most likely being banished at one time or another because they handle their happy hour liquor as well as a wet fart on a plastic chair riding the Metra. Not that I am a perfect bar fly, just noticed a few folks that have caused high maintenance trouble at more than one of the bastions of barley and hops that I have frequently attended. Highly recommend the &#34;OT&#34; as a destination for a game or a happy hour gathering but do suggest an extra $20 in the wallet for a cab ride home because the general atmosphere comes across as a fun time that won&#39;t suddenly stop at the &#34;limit&#34;.

There was also another girl (blonde) training but taking tables on the other side. While I enjoyed the service from our training server, it appeared that no one was really helping her out. We ordered food and we&#39;re told that it would be over an hour. That was correct, it was. Why? I don&#39;t know. Was it worth the wait? Absolutely not! I&#39;ve been to a 5 star steakhouse on a Saturday night without reservations and waited less time to be seated and fed. Over an hour for less than average quality nachos... I&#39;m glad we didn&#39;t pay more than $2 for the drafts we were having. I wanted to tip the lady that paid attention to us all night (the one in training, Tyesha) but she said that as a trainer she couldn&#39;t accept it. I found that to be a pretty stand up thing for her to do. Although we didn&#39;t feel the lady with red and black hair deserved the tip we hoped Tyesha would receive a portion of it. I think if ur gonna turn good people into great servers you should start with proper training. She must have had previous experience or she might have been lost.

It is choo-choo train themed diner. The food is quite good considering the diner is geared to entertain children. On the evening we were there, the specials included Siracha wings and French dip nachos - hardly children&#39;s fare. Â I had the beer batter deep fried cod; it included three nice sized pieces of moist cod and a choice of fries or chips. Â My wife had the patty melt which she enjoyed; it included a generous portion meat. Our granddaughter, well she just had a plain hot dog which was what she wanted.The stools around the center diner table are low for adults, but at comfortable height for older children. Â For younger children, the stool seat can be removed and replaced with a high chair or booster seat. To entertain the kids, the meals are delivered by a choo-choo train. If you don&#39;t want to sit so low, there are booths on the outside of the diner - no train-delivered food, tho.On the screen in the back of the diner, a &#39;Thomas the Train&#39; video plays for the young ones. Â Additionally, there are video and arcade games for the kids to play. When you leave, the children are given a complementary plastic ring and a train whistle (you&#39;ll enjoy that on your way home!).All in all, we all had a nice time and some delicious food.

I kinda expected it to just be mediocre and that the place thrives on the train gimmick. But I had a bacon cheese burger that was pretty amazing. My husband enjoyed his burger. The kids shared a meal and inhaled it. Next time I&#39;ll pass on the special fried pickles, they needed more pickle, it was like eating fried cucumbers.I will also add that while we were there, the woman sitting next to my husband had a medical emergency.

Fair warning the second: you&#39;ll probably have a longer wait time if you want to sit at the counter than if you want a booth.The place does get busy. Luckily, there&#39;s another model train, complete with effects, in front of the restaurant.

I was so wrong.First, this place is full of trains. There&#39;s the train that runs along the counter that delivers your food (of course). And then there&#39;s the train that runs along the upper wall, along the whole course of the restaurant. Then there&#39;s the miniature train set up where your kids can push the buttons to make different parts of the display light up or move. Then there&#39;s the mechanical train ride that rattles and hums. Then the two large Flat-screens that run Thomas the Train videos non stop.Sensory overload? Surprisingly for me and my son, No.Then there&#39;s the great menu I mentioned earlier. There are burgers and dogs, but I love that there are many different kinds of toppings for your burger. There are many different salads, sandwiches, chicken, fish available too. I love it. And yeah, other than the fountain drinks and milkshakes, you can order beer (some craft options too) and wine.My buffalo chicken salad was delicious. They also offer unlimited refills of soda so my diet coke was filled as often as I wished. I tried my son&#39;s burger and fries--both tasty. And his strawberry milkshake was pretty darn good too.Service was spectacular from beginning to end. The hostess (whom I think is one of the owners) was super sweet and helped my and my son settle in to our seats. Our server was awesome and really anticipated our needs. The price was right for a nice meal and train entertainment.The restaurant opens at 11 and when we arrived at 1120 on a Saturday, we were lucky to snag some of the last seats at the counter. There&#39;s booth seating but the train doesn&#39;t deliver your food to you.

This is vital bc if you sit at the bar, you get to have a model train bring the food to you!!!!! What.I ordered the buffalo ranch chicken sandwich. It was like Portillo&#39;s good. The fries were decent too. My babydaddy ordered the Big Boy burger. It was so good, I dare say almost better than the original Big Boy (of which we sadly don&#39;t have any locations in the western burbs). So delicious. Plus they serve beer.Here is the heart warming part: A 2 year old boy across the counter from us was having his bday at All Aboard. It was so cute to see the train bring him and his sis each a blue frosting covered cupcake. His eyes were wide with amazement and the staff also sang him a bday song. I clapped along like a huge dweeb, it was a magical moment.There is a fantastic mural on the wall back by the bathrooms. If you want to see a glamorous giraffe and a lion in a beret, I highly suggest checking it out.There is also a bunch of claw games in the restaurant. They are each $0.50 to play. If you want to waste $0.50, let a 4 year old play a claw game without any help.

The owners (I&#39;m assuming) were so nice and had 3 seats ready for us as we walked in the door. They serve beer and wine (great idea) and there was a lot on the menu. The food was really good, and I plan on going back to try some more. I also like how they serve Kraft mac and cheese (and note it on the menu so you know that it is) because 95% of the time, it&#39;s the only mac and cheese kids will eat. They are smart to have good food because it&#39;s the parents that take their kids back! I also expected angry teenagers to be working but the waitstaff was great - smiles all around on their faces! The only reason why I only gave 4 stars was because you can&#39;t move the chairs at the &#34;bar.&#34; I felt like I had to yell for my husband to hear me when I was trying to talk to him.

Â So much fun!First time this weekend and the kids LOVED it. Â Our two little ones were enthralled from the moment we stepped in. Â They are 3 and 5 but there was an array of kids here ranging in age and all of them seemed to be having a great time.The hostess greeted us right away and asked if we would like to sit at the counter or the booth. Â There is a U-shaped counter space with bar stools that take up the middle of the restaurant...around/on top of that U are train tracks where the food is delivered via train stops. Â On either side of the U, there are booths and tables. Â At the open end of the U is the kitchen and a huge flat-screen monitor showing cartoons (Thomas the Train on this day, Â of course).Our son loves sitting in booths so I initially said &#39;booth&#39; but the hostess was great, asked if we were in a hurry, and then convinced us to take a seat at the counter. Â It was full at the time, but she had a party leaving, and sure enough, we were seated within 2-3 minutes after that. Â I really appreciate that she wanted us to enjoy our time here. Â I&#39;d told her it was our first time and she wanted us to get the most of it.Food orders included hot dogs, cheese pizza and egg salad sandwich. Good food for a great price. Â I was tempted to order beer or wine, but didn&#39;t. Â We&#39;re french fry fanatics and the ones here were really good too. Â The egg salad had cut-up pickles in it. Â Tasted better to me than the usual relish mix. Â Service was quick but they didn&#39;t rush us after the meal...giving the kids a little more time to enjoy the train delivering meals to others at the counter.The rest of the diner has games and gum-ball machines. Â Most games are 50 cents each (they also have the &#39;claw&#39; game with candy...play till you win). Â Another train runs along the top of the restaurant Â just under the ceiling. In the front is a train display where the kids can press buttons to make the train (and other things) go. Â They also have a separate bday party room off to the right once you first step in. Â Bathrooms and coat hooks in the back of the restaurant.Staff here is all wonderfully friendly and efficient. Â When we left and paid the bill, they asked if we had a good time and was happy to hear we did. Â They also gave us a frequent visitor&#39;s punch card Â I have a feeling we&#39;ll be using it a lot. Â The kids also got to take home train whistles.Overall, a terrific experience. Â Kids have been asking when we can go back. Â We&#39;ll have to be back soon.

I wanted a special activity for our last day together (I got a big girl job unexpectedly and we had to part ways). I knew she goes cuckoo for the the little Thomas trains at the public library so I thought this might just be the place to be!We rolled in about 12:45 on a Friday and the place was surprisingly not packed. Busy, but not packed. Cute decor all over the restaurant, a train that runs the length of the restaurant while you eat and TVs playing Thomas the Tank Engine all over the place. Awesome sensory overload! To top it all off- a train brings you your food and always runs the length of the seating area so there is a train before your eyes once about every 20 minutes.Long story short- girly loved it! All I heard was &#34;wooooooooow&#34; as she alternated pointing to either train as it drove by. It was hard to get her to pay attention to her food! Staff was super polite, the owners were there working and they made sure everyone was well taken care of. Didn&#39;t even bat an eye when girly stole my cup of water and promptly dumped all over herself and the floor; they actually brought her her own cup with a lid!Then why the 4 stars? Here&#39;s the big difference between this location and the downtown train diner. The price. Downtown doesn&#39;t have all the frills that this place has but their food is priced significantly lower. This location has prices more like you&#39;re eating out at a diner restaurant. $5.99 for a kids meal- a cup of macaroni and cheese and a fruit cup. I had I believe about $6.95+ for a veggie burger and fries. That in itself was not bad but I couldn&#39;t get over the $5.99 for girly&#39;s food.

Â Standard diner fare - burgers, hot dogs, fries, chicken sandwiches and ice cream. Â My kids were ecstatic. Â While they wait, they&#39;ll be entertained by the train circling the room from the track suspended from the ceiling, or the model train/town set up. Â There are also televisions showing Thomas the Tank Engine videos (no sound when I was there) but it was the last thing my kids paid attention to.If Yelp had half star ratings, I might be tempted to dock another fussy, parental half star for giving each kid a free whistle as they leave (don&#39;t worry - no shrill blasts in the restaurant).

Â A nicely designed location, it sports plenty of seating, good service, a LARGE menu, and a good experience.Sometimes the smallest detail can give you a good insight into a business. Â Here, I&#39;d have to say, it&#39;s the fact that they&#39;ve chosen to use large baskets on the train for their food. Â They&#39;re not chintzy with the food; the baskets come full, and the food is very good.It might sound strange, but we kind of measure most of these places in comparison to The Choo Choo in Des Plaines. Â The Choo Choo is a virtual madhouse of kids, activity, and radiates an underlying sense of joy by the owner. Â It&#39;s small and cramped, though we allow for that due to the historical nature, and so, given the great atmosphere, The Choo Choo gets high marks in the end.All Aboard is a little more sedate, and is a much larger, nicer, and modern place. Â It is different from The Choo Choo, but is every bit as nice an experience in a different way. Â Anyone contemplating a train restaurant would be well-advised to note:1) Great selection of food on the menu, including the way it has been executed - nice to get a basket that doesn&#39;t look skimpy,2) Nice decor, very enjoyable for both the kids and the adults. Â The overhead train, train layout in front, etc. all keep it a bit more exciting for the kids,3) Good call on having a (small) party room and an ice cream stationThings that aren&#39;t so hot:Seating during peak times. Â Cheating by sticking chairs between stools is kind of crummy. Â Probably okay if it&#39;s just for kids, but two adults and a kid - that just doesn&#39;t cut it. Â (The toddler highchairs over a stool thing is way cool, however, and definite bonus points for having the best highchair-to-seating ratio I&#39;ve ever seen.)Location, location, location... Â the first time we went, it was hard to find, until we figured out it was way in the back of a strip mall area. Â 2Toots DG definitely has the gold medal for location.Overall, though, I&#39;d have to put this at the top of the list - probably alongside The Choo Choo - for excellence in train-themed restaurants in Chicago."all-aboard-diner-downers-grove,Bleu W.,MiJViErp-AL34EHXSOA_7w,"New York, NY",0,1,0,62,287,gdwcnO9y-LTe-MsRKnVTGQ,4,28/09/11,Great place for kids and excellent with food allergy concerns.

The menu here is much larger than Two Toots, and the restaurant is much larger as well. It is also a bit cleaner here, and the service is definitely far less surly than the high school or community-college kids who work at Two Toots.Let&#39;s call it like it is, this is a restaurant for toddlers and little kids. In that aspect, it excels. My daughter had an absolute blast here. You know the concept, so I won&#39;t repeat it. Train that brings the food? Check. Train decor? Check.The main counter, on which the train runs that brings the food, is huge. The seats are a little low compared with the height of the counter, so it is a little awkward sitting there. Also, the stools are placed pretty far apart. This is good from the standpoint of not being crowded up against your neighbor, but bad from the standpoint of, if you are coming here with a kid, who will most likely sit between you and the other adult in your party, forget about trying to hold a conversation with them because they will be a good 6 feet away.The food was pretty decent. My wife got the BBQ Pork Sandwich, and I got the French Dip. Both were really tasty, although it would have been nice to have a bit more dip, and in a little wider-mouthed container. Our daughter got the chicken nuggets and potato chips, and she actually ate a bunch of the nuggets (she&#39;s notoriously picky, and either loves or hates chicken nuggets depending upon the day or the position of the planets). As an appetizer, we ordered the Sweet &amp; Spicy Asian Boneless Wings (yeah, that right there will tell you this is a step up from Two Toots), and they were really good. Presentation was a little dull, but come on, you&#39;re here for the trains and food that is decent enough to make you refrain from toddler-overload-induced thoughts of suicide.Overall, while not the height of gastronomic excellence or originality, this place is the best of the train restaurants I&#39;ve been to, yet."all-aboard-diner-downers-grove,Heather L.,JkTFUVXUxl5oBSBhS2r_9g,"Addison, IL",0,1,0,26,57,58k1gIzibRUNy6sHjA8lTw,5,23/07/11,"Take your toddlers here!

Since both boys are total train fanatics, we thought they&#39;d love All Aboard ... and we were right!The All Aboard is in a large shopping plaza, which had plenty of parking. (We drove from Rosemont, which was a hike, but at least it wasn&#39;t downtown traffic!) We went on a Saturday evening, and were pleasantly surprised to find that they weren&#39;t terribly busy.The boys were immediately transfixed by the train chugging around the wall and the one delivering food to diners. There were also several games, a small train to ride in, a very cool miniature train set-up, and a train whistle kids can pull on when they leave. (My sons could have done that all day!) The diner looked clean and tidy.The restaurant had both high chairs and booster seats available to fit over the bar stools at the counter, which was nice for the boys. There was a good selection of kids&#39; items, with some healthy options (milk and a fruit cup instead of pop and fries, for example). Most of the food was fairly typical diner food (hot dogs, sandwiches, etc.), but what we had was very tasty. The prices seemed reasonable to me -- I think we spent $36 for four people.We don&#39;t have food allergies in our family, but I did notice there were several menu options (including desserts) for kids who do have them, which was a nice touch.I was afraid getting the kids to leave would result in tears, but the lure of the train whistle convinced them to head for the door so they could try it out. We had a great time, and next time we&#39;re in the Chicago area, we&#39;ll certainly be back!"all-aboard-diner-downers-grove,Kirk W.,7pXazRCBHVOiljYmGrd_Sw,"Western Springs, IL",0,1,0,0,9,Kn2DIlGfaeovfFM_s4_f1Q,5,18/04/11,"Can restaurants that specialize in delivering your food via train be considered it own genre? Â  Â It could very well be because just about everyone who goes to these places has a child under 7. Â  Â  The really funny thing about All Aboard Diner is that food is actually .... pretty good!I had the Reuben and my wife had a burger and they were both quite good. Â  My son had a hot dog - and well that&#39;s pretty hard to screw up. Â  Â  Â Also try one of their shakes. Â  Be careful when you go - as on school holidays (President&#39;s Day, etc.) this place gets packed and you&#39;ll be waiting for a table.You may not appreciate this place if you don&#39;t have a little kid in tow ...

Â My kids can&#39;t get enough of the train delivering food. Â Even if the food isn&#39;t being delivered to them. Â My son is a huge Thomas the Tank fan, so he just loves this place. Â Not to mention the huge TV screen playing episodes of Thomas the Tank Engine. (But they also have another less obvious TV playing stuff for the adults). Â The looks on my children&#39;s faces both times make All Aboard well worth it.I tried another train themed restaurant (Choo Choo Diner in Des Plaines), at there was absolutely no comparing. Â All Aboard is definitely much better. Â When I went to the place in Des Plaines is when I realized how very clean All Aboard is (Choo Choo Diner was not as well kept and I noticed it the moment I walked thru the door.)The food is great. Â They have a pretty large menu for the size of the operation. Â It&#39;s very impressive. Â Between food, drink, and dessert, you can spend an easy $10+ per person. Â But the quality of the food is great and well worth it. Â I love the pizza burger.Service is always very friendly. Â I have never had a wait time the times we&#39;ve gone. Â However, I have pinpointed a non-peak time (which I&#39;m not sharing with you or you&#39;ll all be showing up at my secret day and time).Location wise - I think it&#39;s great that&#39;s it&#39;s located in a plaza/mall with more than ample parking. Â Heads up, the first time I went I recieved some odd directions from either my GPS or Mapquest. Â I can&#39;t remember which. Â So just in case, taking I-355 to 75th is the easiest way to get there. Â When you exit on 75th you would want to go eastbound, and the diner would be on the left side right by the Toy R Us.All in all, this is a great place, great food, family oriented, and I could be here an eternity typing every detail about how wonderful it is.

For once, and I mean this never happens, they actually arrived early, leaving me little time to fully research my lunch choices. I had read that there was a vegan choice here and that it also served great burgers (hey, I don&#39;t always have to give up my meat!!). It was fairly close, and seemed fast....How the name &#34;All Aboard Diner&#34; escaped my attention, or &#34;my kids love this place!&#34; - is far beyond me. But I had absolutely no inkling that this place was a train themed cafe made mostly for kids (although, I think they are missing a business opportunity by not making this 21+ after 10 pm on the weekends and using that train to deliver shots...).That being said... this. place. was. awesome! How fun!! Short little stools sitting around a railroad track that had trains delivering your food to you! There were exactly three seats left at the bar area that they offered to us, but we didn&#39;t feel right stealing those last seats from the kids that would inevitably arrive just after us being seated. We opted for a more comfortable booth. I was content to be here just to be somewhere so different and fun, but the burning question is - can the food have any choice of being good here?... and how many vegan options are there ACTUALLY at a place like this?As far as the vegan options, I was disappointed. I don&#39;t think I&#39;d recommend this for vegans, even though there are vegan &#34;options&#34;. I put options in quotes because I asked the waiter what their options were and he was like &#34;oh! we have a boca burger...&#34; ...I waited for the &#34;and....&#34; but it didn&#39;t come. That being said, if you enjoy Boca burgers, come on in, vegans! My mom and sister were not sad about this. They said that it was as good as any boca burger they have ever had, and it really hit the spot after a long morning of driving! (Phew!)As far as the food for the rest of us, I was definitely pleased. I got the Cajun spiced burger. I have to admit, I was a little worried that it would be tasteless. I guess I just don&#39;t expect a place like this to have good food because they don&#39;t have to. Kids will force their parents to come here anyway. The burger was very good. You could definitely taste the spices and it was juicy and cooked to order. The fries were just good fries. I really enjoyed my lunch, as did my mom and sister.I guess this place isn&#39;t for everyone. But definitely if you have a family, bring the kids here, they will love it for sure! If you are looking for a cute place to go out to a quick lunch or dinner, I would say to give it a try. How often can you have your food delivered to you on a model train? I mean really...."kyoto-japanese-sushi-restaurant-downers-grove,Brande O.,bkZlAdArOw0s8x1AaJ36Mg,"Lombard, IL",1,1,0,126,155,jXKTHavUNV7c15JcqyfcmQ,4,24/05/16,"My husband and I came across this place by chance while waiting on a pair of glasses at the LensCrafters a few shops down. We have been in that plaza a million times and never even knew that it was there! But by kismet we had a crazy hankering for Asian cuisine and the god of raw fish delivered this magical treat to us.It doesn&#39;t look like much from the outside, but that quickly changes. It is a nondescript storefront sharing the plaza with Toys R Us, Best Buy, Half Price Books, and a bunch of smaller stores and restaurants. There isn&#39;t much to draw you in, but you should totally listen to me anyway and go! Once you get inside, the atmosphere is super zen and the restaurant is wonderfully decorated and comfortable. The wait staff is prompt and polite, making sure your drinks never go empty. There are plenty of booths and tables in the front of the restaurant, but also a few more private areas in the back. They have a sushi bar and a drinks bar, as well as a full menu with all of the Pan Asian favorites if you&#39;re not in a sushi mood (crab rangoon, thai rice, mongolian beef, sesame or orange chicken, pad thai, etc.).We tried an eclectic assortment including both sushi and the tasty appetizers and entrees listed above. I actually found the prices to be pretty similar to all of the other restaurants in the Downers Grove/Oak Brook area, and well worth the cost. If you&#39;re in this area and at a sit down restaurant, you can certainly expect to pay at least $12-$15 for a meal. The sushi rolls were excellent, probably some of the best I&#39;ve tried. My husband absolutely swooned over his mongolian beef. Everything that we had seemed excellent for the price. They clearly go to a great deal of effort on the preparation and presentation of the food, and this shows in the quality of the meal.

What surprised me was behind that was another seating area with louvered doors to separate diners and a nice size bar w/ a tv. Bathrooms were kept clean and neat.Back to our table, I enjoyed the black leather chairs and neat tables everyone had. Very comfortable. Sushi was very fresh and rolls were presently with ginger and wasabi. Nothing had an odd appearance, or smelled bad, or tasted poor. All top quality! Enjoyed the blacked tuna as an appetizer also along w/ miso soup. Rolls sampled were Volcano,Caterpillar,Flaming Snow,Rainbow roll, and Torch.

I didn&#39;t expect a lot walking in. The architecture and interior design inside the place was weird. The room that our group was seated in was in an awkward position in the restaurant, kind of isolated and not part of the main seating area but also not a private room setting since it was still open out. The food itself was good. We ordered uni sushi, fish roe sushi, sashimi platter, seared salmon tacos, salmon sashimi salad, spider roll, udon noodles (stir-fry not soup). The uni was good. We double checked with our server and made sure it had just arrived that morning. The proportion was unlike any other sushi restaurants. There was SO much uni packed on the top that it almost toppled over. The whole thing is supposed to be one bite but it was so big. Restaurants usually have a small portion of uni and small portion of rice, both balanced, or small portion of uni and a lot of rice, but this place served us monster-size uni sushi. Very generous portion. I don&#39;t know if it was just that night. The sashimi slices were fresh too. The salmon taco was unique and creative. Everything was on a very, very thin and crispy fried wonton skin. The salad was very different and pretty good. Both the tacos and the salad were recommended by our server. I don&#39;t think they were on the menu. Their spider roll came out in a very pretty design, with the web drawn on the plate. I&#39;ve never seen that before, but my friend said a lot of restaurants make that design on their plates as well. The roll itself was okay, not amazing but still tasty. The udon noodles were not bad. I&#39;ve always had it in soup so this was the first time trying it in stir-fry style. All in all, it was a good dinner and a very filling one too."kyoto-japanese-sushi-restaurant-downers-grove,Anna K.,QfHaARr7AiAmmOR8axB45w,"Chicago, IL",1,1,1,8,92,SWVqQNCW2Dzv1JymSzhJgg,4,22/05/14,"I had high hopes for this place due to 4 star rating... This review is a combination of two separate lunches. When I first visited on Tuesday, the restaurant had just opened 15 minutes ago and the place was already filling up. I was on a tight lunch break and the waitress was very accommodating. I ordered off the specials menu since it was the first thing within sight. I asked for the godzilla roll and the spicy tuna lollipop. They both came fairly quick and were displayed nicely. However, the flavors just seemed to fall short of my expectations. I am not a fan of cream cheese in my sushi, unless it is minimal. The godzilla roll seemed to be overpowered by the cream cheese and it was all I could taste. Cream cheese and sauce. Not a great combination. The spicy tuna lollipop was okay. It looked very pretty but the flavor was one-note and bland. This should have been a warning for today&#39;s experience.After trying another restaurant in the area for lunch yesterday, I decided to come back to Kyoto for lunch today. To my surprise, the place was empty and I was their only patron. I thought I&#39;d play it safe this time and order the 3 sushi roll lunch special. The special came with miso soup, which I never really liked so I cannot comment on the flavor or quality. I ordered an eel avocado roll, a spicy tuna, and a spicy crab. The lunch special selection was pretty basic, otherwise I would have opted for a caterpillar roll or spider roll. I just didn&#39;t feel like throwing more money down the drain. The eel avocado roll was good, although I felt like it could have had more eel in it. The spicy tuna was not spicy at all, and I should have foreseen this from my last experience. It was extremely disappointing, since I feel that spicy tuna is hard to mess up. The spicy crab was terrible. I did not even taste any of the crab, just rice noodles or something. I&#39;m sure it was shredded imitation crab or something, but it was tasteless. I ate two of the pieces and left it on the plate.There was a man who stood behind the register and checked on customers, so I am going to assume that he is the owner. He came to clear my plate and saw my barely eaten spicy crab roll. He smiled and asked if I had ordered too much and if I wanted a box. I replied with &#34;no, I didn&#39;t like the roll.&#34; His response was &#34;oh, okay&#34; and took my plates away. I wish he would have at least asked why I didn&#39;t like it, but he didn&#39;t seem to care. People in the area must like it, with all these rave reviews. I have a feeling that the flavor of their sushi only comes from the drizzled sauces, not the actual seafood in the roll. Overall, I give it one star for the good customer service on my first visit and the second star for the eel avocado roll. I also appreciate that they don&#39;t put a whole ton of rice on the rolls, as most of the affordable places do."kyoto-japanese-sushi-restaurant-downers-grove,Diane V.,zcQqpK3vsFLt1CaJJFDFYQ,"Wheaton, IL",1,1,1,56,63,rpo6_5u53SAAQfN5kv98tw,2,31/01/15,"We couldn&#39;t get in to Olive Garden or any of the other big restaurants on a Saturday night.

It is never really crowded there either. The dimmed lighting inside is perfect for a romantic evening together. Besides the food what I really like about Kyoto is that it is run by real Japanese folks. The owner is Japanese, the waitresses are Japanese and most importantly the chefs are Japanese! That means you know the food is going to be authentic. The music is also exellent oriental music. Their lunch special is very reasonable. Two rolls and a miso soup for $11 or three for $15.

You can not use this coupon because a hobbit came in yesterday morning at 7 and smashed up our coupon redemption system (firing several pieces of sushi at me.)

Amongst the chain of chain restaurants that pretty much takeover the area, it&#39;s a much welcomed change of scenery. It&#39;s ridiculously close to where I work and quite convenient as well. I&#39;ve come a couple times to take advantage of the lunch specials, and while I haven&#39;t been particularly blown away with anything, I also haven&#39;t been let down. There&#39;s almost nothing sadder than feeling you&#39;ve wasted your money on mediocre sushi.I get the L3 Sushi Bar Lunch Special, which comes with Miso Soup and your choice of 3 rolls from a rather large list. These are mostly basic rolls and they aren&#39;t bad. I call it a &#34;sushi flight&#34; and joke that I travel to New York, Boston, and Alaska. I&#39;ve also ordered the Spicy Tuna roll before. It leaves tingles on the tip of your tongue, but it&#39;s not setting off any fire alarms anytime soon. My spice tolerance is rather low and even I would like a little more kick. However, it is very tasty and probably my favorite. I like the other rolls, but I&#39;m not a huge fan of the cucumber that&#39;s found in most of them. I feel it overpowers the fish and other ingredients.As far as I can tell, Green Tea is free and greatly appreciated by me. It has a robust flavor while remaining relatively light. I go through multiple cups of it and always want more. I wish they would offer a little side salad with the lunch special, but for $15 it&#39;s still not a bad deal. You get 18 pieces of cut up rolls, soup and hot green tea. Tax is $1.25. I typically round up and leave $20. So it&#39;s not the cheapest of lunches, but it&#39;s a nice treat every once in a while and only a few dollars more than many of the surrounding options that provide neither the friendliness or deliciousness that Kyoto serves up."kyoto-japanese-sushi-restaurant-downers-grove,Debbie M.,efrru2EsgCPhy8b-G8h4EQ,"Chicago, IL",0,1,0,6,58,TLaSlBstN-bJXOEbmACw1w,4,05/01/16,Mediocre sushi at best.

Of all the things, The SWT was my favorite--very good quality Tuna--super buttery and melt in your mouth.

Â Not an overabundance of food, but just right if you get it with the rice.Sashimi Deluxe (x2): Â Three pieces of tuna, salmon, super white tuna, snapper, halibut, and two pieces of yellowtail. Â This is going to be hard to explain... all the fish were not fishy (as in spoiled or bad), but at the same time, it didn&#39;t taste fishy enough (it lacked the correct flavor). Â If you&#39;ve ever tasted truly fresh salmon or tuna, you&#39;ll know that while it doesn&#39;t smelly or taste bad, there&#39;s definitely a certain flavor to the fish... and it was missing in all of them except the yellowtail, and the super white tuna.

I feel like Club Mamalu has the potential to be a cool swanky spot, but the mood is kind of killed with the TVs, lack of seating (since they got rid of the booths), and overpriced drinks.That being said, there are definitely some pros which is why they are A-OK in my book.PROS:- Live music on Friday nights!- Super chill atmosphere where you can be guaranteed a seat if you get there before 9:30.- Friendly service.- No cover, even when there is a band.- Decent food (same as Features).ADDITIONAL CONS:- $8 for a small vodka tonic.- Typically hosts an older crowd.Moral of the story... go for the live music!

Usually people will go through here to get into Features because people don&#39;t want to wait in Feature&#39;s line. An older crowd tends to hang out here because of the 80s and 90s music. I love that music and they have a great playlist when I go through. It isn&#39;t as loud as Features, so you can actually talk to one another here too. The only problem I see with this place is how small it is. It can be difficult to walk through when people are crowding the bar.

The music in here is different that the club like music you tend to hear in Features which is nice. You tend to get more oldies in here.

Madeleine (&#34;Mad&#34;) is an enthusiastic experienced chef and focuses on fresh ingredients. While she has a featured menu (Madwhatsfordinner.com) she also has daily specials. We tried the Turkey Cutlets and the Cabernet Beef. The Turkey Cutlets were generous portions of turkey, sweet potatoes, thin stalks of asparagus and a sauce for the cutlets ($11) The Cabernet Beef, marinated chunks of beef (tasting like sauerbraten almost!) came with barley/mushrooms and asparagus ($11). I loved this dish and my hubby loved his turkey cutlets. The dishes quickly reheat in a microwave and are packaged in compostable containers. Some may get two meals out of one dish--but I ate every bit of the Beef! Each dish comes with a dessert of three French madeleines (cookies).I would definitely recommend Madeleine&#39;s.

Plus it had cream cheese in it, which makes it a hard recipe to mess up.The beer selection is better than average, although with the popularity of craft brews these days, it&#39;s hard to find a bad beer menu.

Â The last 2 times were so-so with food and experience. Â A lot of people I know really seem to enjoy this place, and I still haven&#39;t seen why. Â So, this LAST time (because I will never return again), my best friend and I decided to give it one more shot. Â Though we were seated promptly, it took about 4 minutes for someone to even come and greet us at the table. Â After we got our &#34;greeting&#34;,( which she never said Hello, or what her name was..), we decided to order some martini&#39;s. Â *sidenote-we were sitting in the bar area* Â It then took and I kid you not, 10 MIN to receive our drinks. Â TEN MINUTES!! Â There was only one other booth filled besides us and 2 gentlemen at the bar. Â I think the bartender was too concerned to eat his dinner then to tend to his guests. Â Finally receiving our drinks, we put our food order in. Â I ordered a filet cooked medium plus, and a garden salad. Â My friend ordered a chicken wrap and a cup of soup. Â Pretty simple right? Â WRONG!! Â It took ANOTHER 10 MINUTES to get our soup and salad, and when the soup was delivered, there was some dried food on the spoon. Â Now, our waitress didn&#39;t stop back to check on us, so I took it among myself to ask the &#34;oh so busy&#34; bartender for a new spoon. Â  Of course no apology or anything, just plopped the new spoon on the table and I said politely &#34;thank you so much&#34;, which he proceeded to roll his eyes and walk away. Â Now I have my timer on my phone going ( I forgot to mention that earlier), so these times are NOT exaggerated, I restarted my timer after we got our soup and salad. Â The time it took to receive our entree...Ready for this...25MIN!! Â At this point we are so angry, we didn&#39;t even want to eat, but our bellies were rumbling because we have now been sitting here for about an hour! Â Now, of course my filet came out wrong, had to have it re-fired, and the waitress told me the horseradish sauce was my sour cream for the potato, but you know, minor details. Â UGH. Â I will never understand why everyone loves this place so much. Â I don&#39;t get it. Â So, unless you are over 50 and look like you have money, you might get treated with respect. Â If you are in your 30s trying to enjoy a nice dinner, I might recommend Outback or Olive Garden."manhattans-american-bar-and-grill-carol-stream,Angela S.,TPJOX7elkgkXXw39MmK2kA,"Carol Stream, IL",0,1,0,0,158,jZRRuXGxeLzGbL9UsNeBWg,1,29/01/15,"Manhattan&#39;s is one of our favorite places to go that has a relaxed atmosphere for Sunday breakfast or a weekend night for dinner and dancing.

Â However, I was overwhelmed with exactly what I wanted to write about in terms of a bad Easter Brunch experience.First off, the spacial function for this event was UNfunctional. Â They had sat our party of 11 in the corner length wise and the hostess let me know that we could separate our table to better get in and out for the buffet. Â okay...then when our party was complete, we set off to the buffet. Â that was a line out the door and around the galley style bar. Â Anyone belly up at the bar could not leave, the servers could not access the service bar and I felt very uncomfotable and unsteady with a plate of food I was trying to dish up as we moo&#39;ed thru the line. Â They definitely could have come up with a better system.The line began behind the hostess stand with desserts then filtered on past the bar to 1st up, fried chicken.after that was a buffet setting full of eggs. Â that looked green. Â if there was a green eggs and ham theme, I wouldn&#39;t have known because the carving station was last. Â I was relieved when I saw the gal come thru with fresh eggs. Â but she dumped them on top of the old eggs. Â the same thing happened with the crumbled dry bacon that was dumped on top of old very crumpled very dry bacon.same thing with the pancakes.By the time I finished thru the line I couldn&#39;t help but be green with the thoughts of contamination. I helped myself to 2 pieces of french toast and some 3/4 slice of bacon. Â I skipped over the carving station because of the push and pull of the line. Â I was hungry and figured perhaps I could go back when the line wasn&#39;t so full. on Easter. prolly wishful thinking on my part.Right next to our table was a fabulous soup and salad table. thank gawd! Â the creamy chicken dumpling soup satisfied and the salad was good. Â I even saw the waiter bring more soup in a new pot, not just dump new on top of old. Â That was the saving grace. Â Thankfully my father in law payed the bill but I still felt as though I should ask for something considering the one piece (2 halves) of french toast that I ate was like crewing on concrete. Â I was hoping to pay for soup/salad combo instead of the full buffet price of almost $20. Â I would have happily paid and tipped for what I ate... love you Daddy!We had 2 servers and their service was friendly and fast. Holidays can be a pain for us all. Â We decided as a family that next year, perhaps we&#39;ll go out to eat on Easter Saturday instead. Â that buffet was no good for anyone.

While I must admit I never liked the burgers here in the past I found this one to be excellent. My burger was cooked perfectly and had a gregarious portion of Saganacki on top.

Â Interior looks great, a lot nicer than I remember. The bar is now separate so dining can be a quiet experience.Haven&#39;t been to this restaurant in a few years. Had a coupon on a fundraising card. Â Monday night - must be Sr. night. Â A wide variety on the menu. Nice waitress, but then comes the plastic water glasses, and plastic plates, and silverware with no spoons - o.k. we are in a Bar/Grill and not a real restaurant. Â A wide variety of Beers, and knowledgable staff. Â  Apparently their weekend entertainment is a big draw to their bar business. I told our waitress my husband was allergic to onions, we ordered appetizer of stuffed asigo mushrooms, and the chopped onions on top were easily removed. Â Very tasty. His soup arrived - chicken tortilla and it had onions in it. He told the waitress, she came back and instead of bringing the asparagas cream soup she let us know she talked to the chef and onions are in that too, so she gave him a salad instead - good on her part. Â He ordered a chicken pasta dish, no onions, and I ordered the Filet Marsala medium rare. I should of stuck wit Bar/Grill food... my mistake. Â  The dish was very tasty but not marsala, it was a generic brown gravy sause with mushrooms. Â The meat was tender and cooked to order. Â The sauted veggie mix was too oily for my tastes. Â His chicken dish was excellent and brought some home because of the large portion. Â I did not want potato so I asked for pasta instead. She brought a side of fettichini alfredo. It was FANTASTIC - the best part of the meal - creamy, no garlic, just wonderful! Â Ashley was attentive, quick with refills, checking that all was o.k. but not rushed or hovering.

I got the burger and looked furiously for the burger. It wasn&#39;t easily seen and there was supposed to be 2 patties. When I bit in I was relieved to find they in fact did NOT forget my patty, but honestly it wasn&#39;t all that impressive. It was mostly just a big hunk of lettuce with mustard and ketchup and I&#39;ve had a million better burgers at little burger joints like this. While I don&#39;t expect them to be Portillos, I do expect to be satisfied after ingesting those calories and I was not. The fries were tasty, but the burger is supposed to be the main attraction.The ambiance was pretty nice. The counter area was a little chaotic but the dining area was spacious and had tvs on the wall you could watch. Outside was very pretty with umbrellas and well kept trees. The staff was also pleasant, although I didn&#39;t have much interaction with them so I don&#39;t know how they would act given a problem, but still, I like a smile when I walk up to the counter and they delivered.

One of them was Flips Beef &amp; Hot Dogs in Glen Ellyn. Since I put up that initial review the way I&#39;ve been writing has changed, and I figured this would be a good place to revisit and see if the food quality had improved since my first review and to provide a more in depth analysis of the food.First off let me go over the establishment itself, Flips is a small little restaurant with a few tables set up on the inside. There are a few TVs so customers can watch ESPN while eating, and for when the weather is nice some outside tables with umbrellas. There&#39;s also a ledge with stools set up to eat at right across from the main order counter. The main order counter is where you can see the menu board, and place your order, and even see your food prepared if you&#39;re so inclined. In visiting Flips again I decided to go for a hot dog and fries.The hot dog I received on my most recent visit came on a somewhat dry non-poppy seed bun. There was a pickle spear on it that was fairly thick though not particularly sour. There were two somewhat wet and mushy tomato slices on the dog along with two sport peppers that combined in length were not long enough to cover the entire hot dog itself. This meant that I didn&#39;t get sport pepper flavor in every bite. There was a decent amount of mustard on this dog, the onion and relish were a little light. The sausage itself was a skinless frank, it was well heated. The overall taste was decent but the bun was dry and the tomato and pickle flavor really overpowered the rest of the balanced. I wound up having to take those two items off to finish the second half of the dog.I also decided to go for some fries here, they have thick and greasy fries. On the positive side, they&#39;re very crisp on the outside with a nice potato paste inside. On the negative side they are super salty and greasy. Ketchup almost has to be used to sweeten up the incredibly potency of the salting of these fries.Overall my experience with Flip&#39;s left me feeling it&#39;s still slightly below average. The time to get my food was more than one might expect, and the food was a little below average. I&#39;ve had some other items here over the years such as burgers, gyros and chicken sandwiches, but I haven&#39;t had them recently enough to detail my experience properly to incorporate into this review. I&#39;m going to stick with my original rating of two stars, but it&#39;s possible a second updated review may come along at some point touching on the gyros, subs or something else there."flips-glen-ellyn-2,Mike J.,4nk5Wn4ElB2oanaKscQ8pQ,"Tempe, AZ",0,1,1,46,13,OgW2o9NgeXjpO9CB9CrFsw,2,18/06/15,"I have not been here in over 20 years, but stop by today.

In 1997 the burger, gyros, hot dogs and other stuff were all very good. From 2002-2004 they were still very good, in 2011 the gyros salad and plate were still great as well, but the burger was no longer good, nor was the hot dog or the beef.That being said, when I was there last year in November the service had really gone down hill along with the rudeness of the cashier and the cleanliness of the place. The bathroom was out of toilet paper and there was leaking water in there, the table that I sat at, had not been cleaned under-neath the table, there were fries, relish, and pickle under-neath the table and the top was sticky from who sat that before, yes they have surveillance cameras in the restaurant but the person who does the cleaning was not paying attention to the inside of the restaurant or to the bathroom, It was the middle of the afternoon and there were no orders ahead of me and it took way to long for a gyros, the person at the table next to me said his hot dog was not good and that his wife hated her burger and they will not be coming back.I ordered a gyros with fries, the gyros was dried out, the pita bread was stale, the fries were over-cooked on the outside, and very mushy on the inside, greasy and way too salty, I will not be coming back here and I will stick to eating my gyros at Jester&#39;s in Elgin whose quality has not diminished over time."flips-glen-ellyn-2,Kevin S.,V2gtOt6N0nB55Tx04zFU4Q,"Winfield, IL",0,1,1,36,336,7HMhsydMLJ_3wLkw4aeUFg,2,07/10/14,"Flips is by far better then portillo&#39;s in price, taste, and quality.

Nothing fancy- just straight forward fast food. Their service is pretty fast (even during peak times) and the staff is VERY friendly. They normally have ESPN on TV while you wait (nice touch I&#39;d say). Food is very good as it relates to fast food. While it is small, it&#39;s also clean. Parking can also be at a premium during peak times. This is another place I&#39;ve heard students (college) speak well of so that&#39;s another good sign.1. The place is pretty small so things can get tight during peak (lunch &amp; dinner).2. As far as the eats:a. Cheeseburgers are very good. One thing that gets me is when places put more lettuce Â on the burger than meat. That&#39;s not the case here. Made fresh and fast.b. While not one of my top gyros, it&#39;s still very good. On some of my recent visits, I noticed that people put the sauce on the side. Not a deal breaker but worth noting.c. SOLID patty melt (I&#39;m a bit fan of grilled onions on my burger).d. I had the roast beef sub once and I may want to try it again. When I&#39;ve gone here, I&#39;ve been in the mood for a hot sandwich. I liked it.e. The beef sandwich is a hidden gem.3. One minor complaint (and it&#39;s minor). One trend I&#39;ve noticed is that places are going the McDonald&#39;s meals route of #1, #2, etc. Flips does the same things. As a rule of thumb, I don&#39;t eat fries often (I try to limit my high glycemic food intake). If you take the fries out, I want to say the price drops about $.50. Not much of a drop pricewise.All and all, stop and enjoy a meal. If you&#39;re not looking for it, you just might miss it.

I went here for the yelp check-in special of 20% your order, which was higher than anyone else was offering. You get a lot for your money, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be returning. Nothing personal about them, but their large menu isn&#39;t very extensive. Well, that depends on what you want. If you want 6 different variations of hot dogs or hamburgers, then fine. They didn&#39;t have a single patty hamburger, or a crispy chicken sandwich. I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich, and it was like nothing I&#39;ve ever seen before. I did like the spicy option, and the sauce was very good, but the chicken itself was gyro style. It was chopped up in slivers and served on a bun, and I&#39;m not sure how I feel about that. Their chocolate shakes are pretty gross. Very little chocolate, and I&#39;m pretty sure I took a lot of wax from my mouth while drinking the shake. It had an abundance of waxy chunks. I don&#39;t know how else to describe it.

There have been multiple failed establishments at this location (which I never tried), but hopefully this one sticks around.They are located in a very small strip mall with a dog grooming business. The restaurant is not too big, but I was surprised how far the building went to the back; they could fit multiple big parties if need be.Anyways, we were greeted and seated promptly. Of course, sushi is a big part of the menu, but they have other Thai and Chinese dishes as well.My mom and I opted for their lunch specials. She ordered the Salmon Teriyaki Bento Box for $9.00 dollars. It came with the glazed salmon, white rice, house salad, miso soup, and two California rolls.I went with the Chinese Chicken and Broccoli lunch special, which was served with white rice and miso soup. I added a house salad for an additional $2.00 dollar charge (Lunch special was $6.45).My chicken and broccoli was cooked in a sweet brown sauce with carrots. It was very good. The miso soup was my favorite part of my meal. It had seaweed, tofu, and scallions. So tasty! Best miso I&#39;ve had at an Asian restaurant. My house salad featured lettuce, tomato, and cucumbers. The salad itself was nothing special but the ginger dressing (no doubt homemade) was excellent.My mom offered me her sautÃ©ed onions (which were under her salmon) and those were superb as well. She didn&#39;t eat the white rice (I ate mine; hard to mess up white rice but I&#39;ll say it was great). She agreed with me that the dressing was awesome, too.Most importantly, I took a big step in my life today. I, at age 26, had my first (and second) sushi roll! The California roll was awesome; white rice around seaweed, cucumber, avocado, and crab meat. I don&#39;t really do seafood but this place may have turned the tides for me!

Safe to say that I hope this restaurant actually sticks around.For those not familiar with this particular spot, it has been the location of an American grill named after a certain wizard from Lord of the Rings, and a short-lived Vietnamese restaurant. In an attempt to compensate for the fact that no one lives within walking distance of here, Koi Sushi &amp; Grill serves a variety of Chinese, Japanese and Thai dishes, thus fully earning the &#34;Asian Fusion&#34; category label.I kicked things off with a couple of appetizers; gyoza (pan-fried dumplings) and the ringer, agedashi tofu. The gyoza was good (I should have gotten two orders of 6 each) and on the smallish side. The tofu was everything I hoped it would be; somewhat firm but hot, so kind of melty, with a crispy panko coating on the outside, served with some sort of a sweet fish sauce. This also came in a group of six, and I ate three, because the whiter members of my family don&#39;t have an appreciation for tofu.But I digress. The main keeper for me was the Crunchy 2 in 1, which is a terrible name for an awesome signature roll. Basically, take salmon, shallow fry it in panko, wrap it with avocado and crab meat, and put more crunchy things on top. (I guess I can&#39;t think of a better name for it either.) The fish was fresh, and I was sold from there on out.I had bits and pieces of sesame chicken, which was quite crunchy and very good.So look. This place is still easy to drive by, but from what I had, it&#39;s a great place to have an Asian-inspired meal. At $70 (tip included!) for 6 people, it&#39;s criminally cheap, too."koi-sushi-and-grill-wheaton,Tiffany C.,bqEY_UfgaLvGs661ZT3XXA,"Louisville, KY",0,1,0,8,38,C8GQMwz4qiMNR-rbTgcFug,5,25/04/15,"If you live in the burbs and want good sushi, come here.

We came early, no one was there at 6pm, but by 7pm on a Sunday most of the tables were filled (30% off ALL sushi Sunday!) and there were 3 people waiting for their to go orders. The place is nice inside despite it&#39;s meager exterior, clean and simple decor. Not a lot of seating but guessing most of the customers do carryout anyway.The sushi was good, above average, weighted more toward the spicy side for their signature rolls, of which there are many similarities between several signature rolls. We had the fujiyama (hubby liked, I thought it was just OK), the NY roll (very good), Philly (very good), Golden Dragon (excellent), California Roll (son enjoyed). Everything was beautifully plated - my sister said Gordon Ramsey would compliment them on presentation! As for the entrees - I heard the Lo Mein was very good, and the broccoli beef was fine (but this is coming from a super picky eater). The side of veggie fried rice was a little burnt and arrived at the table quite a bit after the entree it was to be eaten with was served. The chicken fried rice was good, a little soft for fried rice but thankfully not salty. But see below - there was probably a good reason for some of the entrees not being up to standards.Our server/cook was the owner, who was super generous, extremely hardworking, and eager to please. He was very apologetic when he made a chicken broccoli instead of the beef. We felt bad because his cook went home sick and he was also down the only server/bus boy in the place. Glad the sushi chef was well! So the owner had to do everything, and in rushing, one of the entree orders was screwed up and the entrees took a while since he was the only one doing the cooking, so one half of the table just started to eat while the rest of us who ordered sushi were almost done. He let us keep the chicken entree and didn&#39;t charge us for dessert. Because he was so busy, we ate our dessert while the used dinner plates were still on the table, which under any other circumstances I would not be a huge fan.

Expected that... but also expected great food based on all the stand-out reviews.We wanted a small sample of the sushi fare and ordered:Miso soupHouse salad with ginger dressingAvocado rollPhiladelphia rollEel Avocado roll(Yes, we love avocado!)Miso soup tasted watered down--definitely don&#39;t recommend it. House salad was good, not great, but worth ordering if it doesn&#39;t already come with your meal and you want your typical ginger dressing.The avocado roll and Philadelphia roll were truly delicious, melt-in-your-mouth sushi--which is exactly what we had been hoping for. The chunks in the sushi were large and you could definitely taste all the flavors.The Eel avocado roll was pretty disappointing though. Even more so because I LOVE eel! The flavor was non-existent, even though the piece was large and it came topped with eel sauce. Bummer. So much for the super amazing sushi...So overall, the food was just ok. I feel like it was pretty hit-or-miss... especially for the price. Their basic rolls were an average of $6. For that much per roll, I&#39;d expect consistency on the basics.We did think it was good enough to come back for the specials though. 30% off rolls on Sundays, and their Lunch Specials had more selection than most for the sushi: $11 for 3 rolls of your choice from a list of about 10-12. (Most places pre-pick the 3 for you and usually always include a California roll.)No real thoughts on the service. We were pretty much the only ones there and the server was attentive.

The food is not good. We&#39;ve tried this place 3 times because we were convinced we were just getting the wrong thing, but every time we were disappointed. The sushi was not fresh and the hot dishes were drowning in sauce but lacking in flavor. Also, overpriced for quality and portion size. The one thing I actually liked was the green tea ice cream, but I doubt they make that themselves. Even so I wouldn&#39;t go back there just for ice cream.

Great lunch specials with a lot to choose from that are reasonably priced. We&#39;ve done carry out and dine in.

Low prices. Smart-mouthed waiter. So, we went to the Chinese Kitchen when we were pinched for time before my brother&#39;s evening graduation. We didn&#39;t have time to explore options in the area and this restaurant was across the street from the graduation. We were greeted and seated immediately, which was great since we were in a rush. The menu had the standard options, which for us was good since we know what we like to eat at Chinese spots. Ordered shortly after we sat down and the food was prepared in under 10 minutes. We were all pleasantly surprised by the large portion sizes and low prices. Then the food was actually really good. The only down side was that the waiter had a smart mouth! For example, I asked for to-go containers, but also needed smaller ones for the sauce. The waiter didn&#39;t really acknowledge my request, but ultimately brought back the large to-go containers. So I told him I also needed smaller ones for the sauce and he said &#34;I know...I only have two hands!&#34; Really?! Then he had a few other smart comments that I would have preferred he kept to himself. But, overall, I&#39;d definitely recommend it. The egg foo young I bought came with two patties, soup, and an egg roll - for only $8.50 which included tax and shrimp fried rice (vs. plan white or fried rice)! If the waiter would have kept the smart comments to himself, this would have received 5 stars. Keep in mind that this is fast food, not an upscale place like PF Chang&#39;s though.

The veggie rice has green peppers, snap/sugar peas, bean sprouts and egg.***3) If you are an eggplant fanatic, or like eggplant the slightest bit- you NEED to try the egg plant &amp; garlic sauce- BUT make sure you tell them LIGHT on the garlic sauce (if you don&#39;t there will be just way too much sauce on the egg plant, it will be too salty, and the sauce masks the eggplant). I have been getting eggplant with garlic sauce for the past 6 years ever since I switched from the orange chicken.Orange chicken is also really good (though it can be a hit or miss on how crispy it is) &amp; Singapore lo mein is great (sometimes it can be a tad dry and other times will be perfectly steamy).You just can&#39;t beat the price for all of the delicious food you get, and I always save my leftovers for dinner!"chinese-kitchen-naperville,Scott K.,6aoTvDDCN3Q2QfvM6vItZQ,"Warrenville, IL",0,1,0,2,1516,i3YscFKJWxB5y0ZOBsP--g,5,12/04/16,This had been my favorite Chinese food place to eat for years (20+) but something has changed with their ingredients or recipes in the past few months or perhaps chefs.

Â On the positive side, I will say this: The food is fresh, with lots of chicken and vegetables, and the pot stickers are very good. The staff is friendly and efficient (my food was ready in exactly 15 minutes, just as the lady said it would be). Â The prices are O.K.On the negative side, I offer the following:BLAND-I don&#39;t know if they eliminated all use of MSG, or if the cook needs a crash course on the use of seasonings, but everything was under-seasoned to the point of being highly forgettable.The egg rolls consist mostly of shredded, unrecognizable vegetable matter-I&#39;ve had much better.And the prices are O.K. $38 for the aforementioned array of entrees and accoutrement."chinese-kitchen-naperville,Joe V.,be3j1fsnG_HHkxxEEK-6Wg,"Batavia, IL",0,1,0,0,20,li_owVyNO9pAgXPYdVnMlw,2,25/08/13,Love this place.

My first thought was this place is a little gross. The water glasses had that greasy look like the water in the dishwasher hasn&#39;t been changed in months. Also, being a waiter in a former life, I noticed the sidework hadn&#39;t been done...ever. For instance, the vinegar bottle, and salt and pepper shaker have never gone through a dishwasher, and the teapot was totally covered by that greasy film on the glasses, and a whole corner was taken by an employee who was peeling string beans that were strewn all over the table. Now that&#39;s authentic Chinese. Ok, enough about the aesthetics, and onto the food.We ordered a seafood hot and sour soup, beef and tomato over rice noodles, yang chow fried rice, and a Cantonese crispy skin chicken. All came out quickly. The hot and sour soup was served in a giant bowl that could have fed 6 or more people, but the broth was gelatinous, which led me think too much corn starch or egg whites were in it. The crispy chicken was good, served with the 5-spice salt, and the yangchow fried rice was decent. The noodles with beef and tomato was a mixed bag. I liked the noodles which had been fried until there was a nice crust on it, but the beef and tomato in the gravy was too salty and too sweet at the same time. The prices were cheap. The whole dinner bill was $34. The place is tiny. It holds about 25 people and you would feel cramped. The decor is tacky...pink walls and chairs and vertical blinds that match their &#34;fine eye&#34; for cleanliness. If you&#39;re looking for that overall Chinatown experience, here it is, right in the burbs.I drove 20 miles from home to try this place, but I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to eat here again. Also, they don&#39;t accept American Express and also have that annoying rule of $10 minimum to use credit cards."chinese-kitchen-naperville,Heather H.,0vUG6lLjNcAuH920NvGiPw,"Seattle, WA",0,1,0,3,57,NQu_dF7CUYZebfxFTBMASw,3,09/04/11,"Woohoo!

Not only because the food is so fresh and delicious, but because this place started in an old Taco Bell (or at least the building looked like it!) hole-in-the-wall location and has grown to so many locations! I&#39;m not sure how &#34;authentic&#34; the mediterranean food is, but damn is it fresh!You first have to decide if you want a plate or a pita. I&#39;ve only had a pita and felt like rolling out of there like an oompa loompa, so I can&#39;t even imagine ordering a plate! And I&#39;ve seen them....like the Filipino culture, it seems like they don&#39;t want anyone to walk out hungry! Once you&#39;ve chosen your plate or pita, you choose your meat. My go-to is the beef tenderloin kabab. It&#39;s probably one of the best cooked slices of steak that I&#39;ve had...and it&#39;s always consistent! I&#39;ve also had the beef kifta kabab, which is very similar to a spiced and herbed hamburger patty. That one is hubby&#39;s go-to :) Inside the pita, you get some hummus, israeli salad (a yummy concoction of veggies) than topped with tahini sauce. They also always serve this green &#34;hot sauce&#34; on the side...which is insanely hot!Probably the best thing here though.....the pita! They make homemade pitas, and if you&#39;re lucky enough to get them right out of the oven (which is pretty often!) it&#39;s like eating a mini mediterranean cloud of goodness.

The chicken shwarma is this absurdly flavorful spit-roasted chicken that is always moist and tender, cut into strips. Then you get pitas which are warm, pillowy perfection, AND tahini, AND this weird hot pepper mix that I don&#39;t dare eat, AND the Israeli salad which is a cucumber-y delight! My mom loves their fries (which are potato chips. Right?! Why are these called fries?) but I can&#39;t get past that unusual and delicious salad.The baklava is packaged and ready to go at the counter, but tastes fresh every time, and is an incredible sweet ending to a delicious meal. Also, it looks really hard to make and like something I couldn&#39;t possibly recreate, so props to them.The food is so fast and even with a drink, is in the $10-$12 standard lunch fare in the area range.

I was wary of this since I generally try more local food while travelling, but went along. I&#39;ve had middle eastern food at many places across the country, but this definitely makes it to my top ten.Ambiance &amp; service: The location is larger than the downtown chicago ones, with plenty of seating. Went here on a friday night, and it was pretty empty, just 3-4 other tables occupied. The store is clean and brightly lit, and the employees are friendly and serve you with a smile on their faces. It is a self service restaurant, where you tell them what ingredients to put, and they make it in front of you.Food: Pretty darn good. Generally, falafel balls come out very dry and are not very flavorful. Naf Naf does a good job here, and the falafels are excellent. We had a pita sandwich, a rice bowl, and a bowl of soup and fries. Both, the sandwich and rice bowl were excellent. They have fresh salads to top off the bowl, and their sauces are really well made.The soup was pretty decent, but the fries were too good, wouldn&#39;t recommend missing them.I can possibly come back when I&#39;m not too well, to only get the soup and a side of rice.Value: Well priced, and good quantity. Sandwiches are around $8-10, and sides for $2-3, it is a perfect lunch place. Food isn&#39;t too greasy or heavy, so that&#39;s a plus.I would recommend everyone who likes middle-eastern or Mediterranean food to go here asap! Loved the place, and will be surely going back when I visit Chicago again."naf-naf-grill-naperville-5,Andrei I.,6NSxlI_MmotsAFZM_du-RA,"Naperville, IL",0,1,0,0,231,JFidO9BPVhbUlXnW4pq4Xw,5,30/10/16,"I love the Naf Naf chain!! but this one doesn&#39;t have my favorite thing on the menu, the beef tenderloin! :("naf-naf-grill-naperville-5,Ashley A.,17kCwheyjZVDjDmUMxGivg,"Westmont, IL",1,1,1,109,122,ZYYKpaW8BzwT16tWQv9aCQ,4,21/11/15,"I didn&#39;t realize this place only offers a smaller version of their menu than other locations. I was downtown Naperville and called in my take out order since I know the one on Freedom Drive gets crazy busy. And with a toddler in tow I wanted my food ready when I got there and didn&#39;t have a toddler meltdown sitch.Well I got there and there was no one in the joint. I mean, crickets. It was 5 p.m. on a weeknight and I was a little put off since no one was there. But I went to the counter and the guy had my order all ready to go. He was nice and told me where to park next time that won&#39;t require the parking garage (it&#39;s behind the building FYI0), so I&#39;ll remember that next time.Well my little one thought we were eating there, proceeded to pull out a chair, climb up, and pat the seat next to her like &#34;Come on mommy, it&#39;s time to eat!&#34; Well how can you say no to that? I pulled up a chair and we ripped into our falafel pita sandwich with everything on it. My daughter devoured it and looked like she was in a food coma! Apparently this is toddler approved food. I love everything on their menu. Nothing I wouldn&#39;t order, just depends on my mood. Highly suggest eating here if you haven&#39;t already!Well like I mentioned earlier they don&#39;t offer the full menu that I&#39;m used to. My hubby gave me his takeout order and not only do they not have dinner plates, they don&#39;t have the chicken breast as an option. They only have chicken shawarma, steak shawarma, and falafel. With those items you can put it in a pita sandy, in a rice or salad bowl, or a hummus bowl. It&#39;s kind of set up like a Chipotle where you order what you want and then you can add what toppings etc.I like this set up and this location but it was still a bummer that they don&#39;t have the full menu offered.

The flatbread however, amazing.I ordered the chicken shawarma along with rice, salad, onions, garlic sauce and pickles. The only thing memorable? The pickles. Those were delicious.

The food was ready for pick up on time and easily packaged to take home; however, I probably would not order from them for catering again. First, the meat portions are just sad. The chicken and steak went so fast that I was embarrassed that there was none left for guests who arrived later. This might have been supplemented by the falafel that I ordered, but Naf Naf forgot to include it. So, there was no entrÃ©e for my vegetarian guests and scarce quantities for everyone else. Â There was more of the condiments than anyone could have ever eaten - onions and cabbage galore - but those are cheap and no one wants a plate full of cabbage when they should have been eating falafel. Â Otherwise, the food was tasty, fresh, and easy to lay out for guests.It took two phone calls and 30 minutes to receive the falafel refund. The manager gave a quick &#34;sorry,&#34; but that was it. When I&#39;m left feeling like a poor host due to the caterer&#39;s mix up, I think the restaurant ought to offer more than just the dollar amount I was shorted.

The options for the shawarma are chicken, steak, or vegetarian. You can also get a shawarma bowl where they give you yellow rice instead of the pita bread.

This was confusing to me on my first visit as I&#39;m used to them making it with the appropriate sides.My first visit was on opening day and I was greeted by a snobby sales person.My second visit left me with the wrong order, a skimpier order of potato chips, only 1 pita when I asked for two with my hummus, and the pita was cold.

Fantastic wait service and speedy food delivery to the table.The first visit I ordered the special: Lasagna...After about 3 bites, I found that I could not pallette anymore of the foul flavor of the meat or the noodles. The sauce was acidic and not at all appealing.The second visit in September was brought about by the GIFT CARD that the Manager gave me for the Lasagna.I ordered the Spaghetti with Meatballs and it arrived with plain noodles, a teaspoon of Marinara sauce and 3 meatballs. Yes, a TEASPOON of SAUCE!Yeah, I know that apparently it&#39;s not common for Italian restaurants to provide much sauce with your pasta, but having grown up AMERICAN, this was just so pathetic.I ended up ordering 4 more sides of sauce (they gave me 2-3 oz per request) and eventually settled down to eat my spaghetti. The noodles were perfectly al dente, the sauce was tasty, but acidic. I added about 1/4 cup Parmesan and it helped.BUT THOSE MEATBALLS!O.M.G. how horrible they tasted. Like mildewed socks left near a litter box.Apparently, Biaggi&#39;s loads up every meat recipe with more BASIL than any other ingredient. Basil is a potent, powerful flavor and a simple dash of it is enough for a gallon of Spaghetti. These meatballs were more Basil than they were meat.I gave Biaggi&#39;s a second chance.

There is an option to enjoy a smaller portion of any of their delicious pasta selections. I don&#39;t recommend it. The portion is pretty small to begin with, you don&#39;t really want to go even smaller to save a few dollars. Get the full size. You&#39;ll love every bite.SEA SCALLOP RISOTTO(Seared Jumbo Scallops, Creamy Italian Ricewith Asparagus, Corn &amp; Pancetta,Basil-Leek Reduction, Jumbo Lump Crab), is a great dish. I&#39;ve had it twice and both times, the risotto was cooked perfectly. The little pieces of asparagus, corn, and pancetta pairs well with the creaminess of the rice. The sea scallops are a decent size, lightly seared and I think it might be buttered as well. It&#39;s delicious and doesn&#39;t have that gross ammonia taste with bad scallops. The only complaint I had is the &#34;jumbo lump crab&#34; description.

Â Our server, John was a nice guy, friendly and provided good service. Â For dinner, I had the wedge salad and a pizza. The wedge was large enough for two to share and was good, lots of yummy blue cheese. Â My wild mushroom and truffle pizza was flavorful.

We noticed that the table that got sat after us even got waited on before us. So when we mentioned it the manager came over and took very well care of us after that. I will say the food was excellent! We got the fried ravioli for an app. And for our entrees we got the chicken parm and I can&#39;t remember what my husbands entree but both were amazing. So overall, this was a good experience and very happy with how the manager took care of us. We will definitely be back."biaggis-restaurant-naperville,Anonymous F.,vt75w4qvYxOlKXXsRxevpw,"Naperville, IL",0,1,0,9,5,iFHiOKSLhpYUYvhwMXUhWQ,4,24/03/15,Beautiful ambiance!Our waitress was very friendly and gave good recommendations.

Â Had this dish many times in the past and loved it. Â They must have changed the recipe. Â Instead of large roasted veggies mixed with risotto this time they were all chopped the size of peas. Â Just didn&#39;t have the same taste or feeling. Â I always order a tiramisu to go to have later at home. Â Bad batch today. The &#39;ladyfinger&#39; layer was dry. Â Very disappointing.

Once last year and it was a nice experience. Once last Sunday and I was disappointed.We ordered appetizers which were very good. Our server suggested we order our entree if we knew what we wanted. She assured us she would time it out so things didn&#39;t get doubled up. It did not happen that way. We were 30% done with the apps and here comes the entrees. Grrrr.The entrees were good, however there was a constant presents of fruit fly&#39;s around our plates as the meal went on. Grrrr. Unacceptable!I had noticed a peach cobbler dessert special that I wanted to take out for later. It took forever to get to the table. It came in a nice little bag with three containers. When I got home I discovered, one was a scoop of ice cream, one was four thin strawberry slices and one was a very small quantity of peach slices reduced in a syrup. That&#39;s it.

We look up at yelp and we found great reviews Of Biaggis so we went there... The building of the restaurant has a very nice and expensive look also inside is very nice. When we got there the hostess wasn&#39;t there so we waited some minutes so it was not very good for the kind of restaurant that it is. Then we were sat and the waiter was not very put together and her blouse was stained which we thought it was a little distasteful. Then the food we ordered was the grilled calamari and we thought that in general the food was lack of flavor not very good .. The minestrone soupWas almost water and can flavor. The fish was ok but again it didn&#39;t have much salt...

I order the filet mignon it was 5 oz and on their &#34; Lighter&#34; side of the menu. It was good however when they say the &#34; lighter side&#34; be aware it means a lot less food. Very small portion of veggies and roasted potatoes. I liked my filet it was cooked as I ordered it. I also liked their bruschetta with a balsamic glaze to it which I thought was a great touch to an old classic appetizer. Â We finished off dessert by spilting a lemon tower cake it was delicious.

I live nearby and my wife and I eat out several times a week and have never experienced the treatment we received at Biaggi&#39;s last week. First, the waiter was as rude as he could be but, it gets worse when I am served a drink and happen to feel something in my mouth and I swallow what turns out to be glass. I look at the drink and notice that the top of the glass is chipped and cracked down the side. I inform the waiter who grabs the glass from me and runs. Then I ask to speak with a Manager who I inform what has happened and she tells me that the waiter has clocked out and she knows nothing about this (this is all in ten minutes). The manager went and found the glass in the the trash and I am wondering how our waiter all of the sudden is off duty. She doesn&#39;t know what is going on and then another manager comes over and we explain what happened and he tells me that I am lying to him. This place is the worst in Naperville and if you are looking for good service or management find another place.

Â The food is delicious and we have never had a bad MAIN course. Â I have my favorite, which is Butternut Squash ravioli, but have had other items that I really enjoyed, such as their jumbo lump crab cakes and Potato Parmesan crusted Tilapia, and of course, their pasta dishes. Â Oddly enough, it&#39;s during the week when it&#39;s not so busy that we&#39;ve had a few poor experiences....usually with the large house dinner salad the my husband and I split. Â Twice it&#39;s arrived at our table with some wilted lettuce in it or bits of slimy, very old lettuce that&#39;s really gone bad, and old shredded carrots. Â I think that during the week when there isn&#39;t such a high flow of customers, that something fresh, like salad ingredients, sits in their refrigerator and starts to go bad. Â On the weekends, the produce is much fresher, I think, because they go through it faster (?)

In this example: good food, high prices. I&#39;ll start with the good (which is almost all!).THE GOOD: We arrived early for our reservations and were sat early - even though the place was PACKED with people waiting - great start. The restaurant is open but still intimate and I loved the decor. Our server was fantastic. A TAD bit overconfident but he knew his ish. I was here with another friend two nights before a marathon, so we were happy to stuff ourselves with the bread and olive oil - so much so that we ordered another round of the free stuff. I settled on the chicken parmesan - something I don&#39;t typically order. They got me with &#34;delicately&#34; breaded, as I wanted some protein but not a bland piece of chicken. I also ordered light cream in the sauce. What came out was absolutely incredible. Savory, wonderful pro-portion of meat to pasta and very fresh. Everyone else was happy with their meals as well. There was a pumpkin creme brulee on special which we ordered as dessert - it was a huge portion for creme brulee and was some of the best I&#39;ve ever had!THE BAD: Holy portion sizes. For the price of $16, I would have expected soup or salad, or enough food to last me a good 2+ meals. But I got none of those. I don&#39;t eat large meals, and almost finished mine. And, the $16 got me that and that only. About 99% of the restaurants in the area serve soup or salad with your entree but this is not one of them.

Delish!My favorite dishes are angel hair with tomato sauce or the pasta and seafood. Their tomato soup is unrivaled, and their starter or entree pizzas are delicately flavored and bright.Don&#39;t leave without having dessert, there&#39;s so much to chose from, and it&#39;s all delicious: the banana chocolate chip bread pudding, the banana crepes, the semifreddo.Menu changes seasonally to keep items fresh and hopping out of the kitchen.This location has a great viewable prepping area in the kitchen that you can pretty much see from almost anywhere you&#39;re seated.

Â For $15 there could have been a little more offered up. Â Maybe bigger cutlets or something.I had the Black Fettuccini with Lobster. Â The Cuttlefish ink gave the fettuccini a little more of a starchy texture and added to the seafood flavor of the dish. Â Tossing in some wild mushrooms with the lobster was an awesome touch!

My friend and I were like &#34;Whaaaat why is this place so fancy??&#34; LOL. #suburbkids. But seriously. I love the bathrooms here too.Quattro Formaggi Tortelloni: 7 big pieces of rich, cheese-filled tortelloni with perfectly tender pasta shells (skins?) over a mixture of creamy pesto and marinara. Yummm. This is like ravioli for grownups.Lobster-stuffed sole: This was on their (seasonal?) special menu. The piece of fish was actually quite small and dwarfed by the big grilled asparagus, but the lobster taste was definitely prevalent and delicious.White chocolate bread pudding: We didn&#39;t even look at the dessert menu; this was a recommendation from our waitress and boy was it decadent -- a big mound of soft bread pudding sitting in a moat of melted white chocolate with a smattering of dark chocolate flakes and strawberry slices.

My experience there recently still gives me nightmares!On previous occasions after eating here I have always felt a little ill but tonight was the worst. We arrived at Biaggi&#39;s at 5:45pm and there were only a few people in the restaurant and we were told we would have to wait at least 20 minutes - not happy! I pointed out that most of the tables were open and came back the reply be patient. Seriously! We were seated approximately 25 minutes later. My friend ordered a chicken dish and I ordered the shrimp risotto. When it arrived we both noticed the food was under cooked and tried to get somebody to help us. After 20 minutes our server returned and we explained our problem. She said &#34;oh really&#34; she took it back and after 15 minutes returned with our food. It was still under cooked and very cold so we sent it back again. There were now a few people in the restaurant and a guy sitting opposite me kept taking photo&#39;s with a flash which was blinding me and I asked him to stop - he was very rude and refused to stop. Â I called for the manager who by the way was leaning over a counter top and refused to do anything about it. On previous occasions I have noticed this manager will lean on anything he can find and pear at the customers which I find a little intimidating. Sloppy manager leads to sloppy staff which leads to a sloppy low level clientele which this place is full of. Our food arrived again and looked like it was cooked, after a few small bites I noticed something wasn&#39;t right and called again for the manager of whom I was told was busy! He was in fact leaning over another counter top, I was not happy! My friend and I decided the food was inedible, sent it back and decided to go and asked for the check while having to observe a waitress slovenly falling over with hugs and never ending kisses to a group of men at another table, manger looking on seeming to enjoy and savor every moment. The bill came to $69 and we pointed out the food was inedible and we did not eat a thing. We payed (which I regret) and left promptly. While I was waiting for my husband outside I began to feel unwell and the next thing I know is that some elderly lady verbally accosted me outside. My husband who had now arrived witnessed the situation and told the lady to go away. She went into the restaurant and then immediately reaperred with her her so called husband who shouted the most awful abuse. We left immediately but by now I was feeling very ill. I am not a person to go running to doctor which on this occasion I really should have as I was sick for at least three days. On a previous occasion I had their Â chicken cannelloni which had some weird plastic covering which was also sent back but again I was very ill. I equally noted they have a open kitchen with the cooks constantly removing their hats and rubbing their hands through their hair. A person who calls themself chef sneezes into the food and then passes it on shouting to the nearest member of staff?! In summary do not go here it is appalling! If i could rate Biaggi&#39;s minus 50 stars I would!"biaggis-restaurant-naperville,Tim H.,zCASNH25GTirvxqtmzuVVw,"Naperville, IL",0,1,1,209,583,YQcX7ADmMjjO1NQ5xvGEKg,1,18/05/13,"Well I have returned and have learned to stay away from their pizza.

Salad was real good this time but wasn&#39;t in the mood for a pork chop, which I have enjoyed in the past.I did edit my last review, as I received a note from a former server, that stated servers are forced to serve what ever the kitchen gives you. Not having worked in the industry, perhaps that is the norm? I always feel the server is the defender of our pleasant or unpleasant experience.It&#39;s all about tact in IMO. I been somewhere and the server makes or brakes the dinner. Two stars mean just that...&#34; I&#39;ve experienced better&#34;. I wouldn&#39;t return if it turned into a pattern.

One positive that I learned about this place that sets it different from other Italian Restaurants is that their food is fresh and you can taste that in each ingredient. (Unlike Frozen from Olive Garden---but I&#39;m not hating cause I love Olive Garden!) My sister and I split the Chicken Marsala. I don&#39;t like my sauce all over the plate so I got it to the side. If you are not a huge eater--split it..but if you are extra hungry-don&#39;t! My parents split a chicken dish too. The chicken is cooked perfectly--you can&#39;t go wrong.Help yourself to bread dipped with oil in the beginning and don&#39;t be shy to look at the desert menu! It offers a lot but I&#39;m glad we made the 7 dollar choice of Banana&#39;s Foster! It&#39;s a crepe filled with banana&#39;s with caramel, chopped almonds, and biscotti surrounding vanilla ice cream on top! It&#39;s HUGE.I was a little cold in here..but I get cold fast so maybe take a light cardigan with you.The ambiance is great. Romantic with huge overhead lamps and it makes you feel like you&#39;re in Italy. Even though I&#39;ve never been to Italy. The service is great too. They have a &#34;party&#34; room in the back too.

It&#39;s one restaurant I find myself recommending that&#39;s on 59. It&#39;s casual, but you could also go a bit more snazzed up, which is really what the environment calls for. If you go on a weeknight, you&#39;re likely able to snag a table upon walking in, that is if you&#39;re going before 6:45. Later dinners you might have to wait; for the weekends, it would be wise to make a reservation.The service is always friendly. I&#39;ve been going more frequently lately, but have been here handfuls of times. Our recent servers, Michael and Amanda were great; very friendly. I love their bread here and find myself scarfing it down every time. I always start with a margarita pizza, because, well, obviously. However, the last time I was there we ordered the crab cakes and those were a pretty groovy chew for sure, a good stray from the usual. The black fettuccine is great, the steaks were rad, appetizers are a go, pasta is a great choice, and the pizza rocks.

Both were bright and fresh, and the mangoneada in particular was quite thick, like a smoothie (mango water is not a good description for this menu item). The rim of chili-based seasoning provided a familiar heat with the drink as well.I also ordered esquites, which was grilled corn with lime and cotija. I&#39;d definitely get this again, and it went well with my Atun tacos, or tacos with breaded tuna cubes.It&#39;s pretty easy to describe the ingredients, but the thing that stands out is the balance of the ingredients. It would be so easy for any of the ingredients on the tacos to overwhelm, and you won&#39;t see me argue against having a fistful of fish on my plate.

We have been here once before and felt for whatever reason the food to be better this time around. Our only minor complaint about this place is that seating is very tight and their tortillas are not homemade. Other than that the cocktails are to die for and food is delicious. Service was great too! We will definitely be back! Portions are deceptively filling! The Bien Trucha tacos and Pastor tacos were spot on. Try the Mango and Pepino cocktail.

We had the pineapple margarita, Jamica cocktail, steak and al pastor tacos with a side of corn, and vanilla flan. The drinks were good. Tacos were on the smaller side but ok I liked the al pastor more because it had more favor and sauce, as for the steak a bit bland. I didn&#39;t enjoy the vanilla flan it was too sweet.

They were fresh and very tasty drinks.We then got to our table and promptly ordered the guac of the day which had mangoes in it. Real tasty, but I cringed knowing that we paid $9 for the lump of it that we got. We also ordered the Bien Trucha and Pollo tacos, both of which were good. The Pollo comes in a fried tortilla, which I was not expecting. The BT tacos were pretty standard steak tacos with cheese and some sauce drizzled over it.All in all it was perfect for the occasion we were there for, and I&#39;m glad to have tried it, but I certainly wouldn&#39;t become a regular here.

They may seat folks there once they are full, as it&#39;s the same ownership.We had the tacos, and tortas. We also had some corn appetizer, which was phenomenal. Can&#39;t remember what it was called (Lo Siento, mi espanol es no bueno) but it was a must have. The tacos were great, tortas were nothing special. The meat on the skewer was tough.A bill for the two of us was $50, plus tip. While the food was great, it wasn&#39;t worth that much. If they brought their prices down by 20% or so, or increased portion size, it&#39;d be a great spot.I also would note that I am all about the larger portions.

It has cheese, peppers, mayo, and a few other things in it.The staff is fantastic.The only thing I don&#39;t like is that it is served tapas style. So you cannot go with a group of people and just get your own thing. They should let you order your own dishes if that is what you want to do.

The hype. Is. Real.My husband and I came here for Cinco de Mayo this year. I of course have read amazing reviews on Yelp, so I decided what better time to check it out. I know Bien Trucha gets hella busy, so I made sure to make a reservation online. It was the morning of cinco de mayo when I checked their availability and luckily we were able to snag their last rezzy! I guess it was meant to be.Although we arrived right on time (6:45 p.m.), I don&#39;t think we were actually seated until about 7. I kind of was prepared for this though, being the holiday and all. What I wasn&#39;t prepared for was the shuffle between two separate buildings. Thanks to Angela P.&#39;s review, I knew A Toda Madre was connected to BT and is basically the same thing so I wasn&#39;t too concerned. It was rather annoying though how the hostess at BT told us we&#39;d be seated faster next door, and then that host sent us back to where we originally were.When this shuffle calmed down we still ended up sitting at the bar and ordering a drink until our table was ready. They had a $5 classic margarita special, so that kept me calm, cool, and collected while we waited. About 15 minutes later we were sat at a quaint 2 person table in the side room. Our waitress greeted us right away and was super helpful.I love the ambiance of the restaurant (although pretty small). A wine bottle-esque pitcher of water was on the table, along with a candle, stylish plates and a simple menu. The scene is perfect for a date night or a girls night out.We started with their classic guacamole and were also given complimentary pinto bean dip. Both were delicious and addicting. Their homemade tortilla chips stood out to me. I&#39;m not sure what it was, but they had the perfect crunch and were not over-salted. It&#39;s safe to say we accidentally filled up pretty well on these pre dinner snacks.Their food is served basically tapas style, so we were instructed to order a few different things to share and they would come out one after another. I really like this concept, however when all was said and done the hubbie and I agreed that we ate too fast in anticipation of the next delicious item coming out!We ordered as follows:Cazuelitas de camarones -- sautÃ©ed shrimp, red onion, garlic, cilantro-chimichurri, and chihuahua cheese served with tortillas (this was basically a make-your-own quesadilla and it was amazing!)Bien Trucha tacos (4) -- grilled skirt steak, chorizo, chihuahua, roasted tomatillo salsoPescadillas tacos (4) -- shredded swordfish, epazote, crispy tortilla, avocado-habanero picoEverything was absolutely amazing. I&#39;m talkin every time either of us took a bite we did that like full mouth &#34;mm hhmm, that&#39;s really good&#34; nod to each other. I literally can&#39;t wait to come back. These are fresh and unique Mexican flavors I&#39;ve never had before. It&#39;s a modern Mexican menu so sure, I&#39;ve had more &#34;authentic feeling&#34; entrees, but Bien Trucha is something special.Definitely go check &#39;em out. Like, NOW!"bien-trucha-geneva-2,Garrett R.,gkXIzzT8dfnMIITVc1pyoA,"St Charles, IL",0,1,1,3,551,2df0G5e9djLu8yeW0FFRaQ,5,25/06/16,Excellent find right in heart of Geneva on route 38. Great outdoor seating although we sat inside to get a break with the air conditioning since we were out in the afternoon enjoying Swedish Days. The tacos came in miniature across a wood plank and my wife and I shared the tuna and swordfish tacos. The swordfish were spicy in a crunchy shell where the tuna was wonderful in soft shell with salad garnish. It was very busy but wait staff very friendly and attentive. We had fresh guacamole with chips while waiting for our entree. Everything was provided timely but never felt rushed. My wife enjoyed the mango water with her meal. Great place and will definitely be back.bien-trucha-geneva-2,Rose D.,FqHNMGc_-BgX4svll0SwLg,"Elgin, IL",1,1,1,240,6,TClSD0RRhr-3UrK9Yl-E_Q,5,03/05/16,"I was hesitant to try Bien Trucha. Since whenever we happen to be in their area it&#39;s lunch time but they don&#39;t take reservations for lunch and the line is usually down the block...and places with a lot of &#34;OMG you MUST go there!&#34; hype tend to disappoint me. Â A few years later the planets aligned to a rainy Saturday where we would be in Saint Charles. Â I hoped the rain would work in our favor keeping the throngs at bay for a bit so we could give them a try for lunch. Â We arrived right before opening and we were rewarded with immediate seating. Â The place filled up within an hour of their opening, however - but there wasn&#39;t a line to get in so a crummy weather day is a good time to give them a try if you can&#39;t make it for a dinner rez time slot.I&#39;d say the food was 4 - 5 stars and the service was 1 - 3 stars so I&#39;m going to settle on 3 stars. Â It&#39;s tapas style but they have teeny tables so plan on just ordering 1 - 2 things at a time. Â We tried the Esquites (roasted corn - amazing &amp; my dining companion who normally doesn&#39;t like corn gobbled it up!), the Bien Trucha tacos (skirt steak &amp; chorizo) &amp; the Atun tacos (tuna) - both tacos were delicious. Â We also tried 2 of the margaritias (the melon, a special that day, &amp; the avocado) &amp; the sangria - all were tasty but they really don&#39;t give you much at all and they don&#39;t give you much &#34;kick&#34; if you know what I mean, either. Â If I&#39;m paying $9 (sangria) - $11/12 (margaritas) each I would like it to be a least a bit stronger.Our server was kind and explained the menu to us and she checked on us regularly. Â We had 2 gripes with the service. Â One was right after our margaritias arrived my dining companion picked it up Â to move it to the side and make room for the food and the glass just slipped right out of his hand. Â I&#39;m not sure if it was a bit of grease from the tortilla chips or what but he picked it up &amp; the glass immediately slipped out and spilled all over the table &amp; him. Â Now this occurred when a bus boy was watching 2 feet away &amp; our server was at the next table taking their order. Â Not a single person came over to help clean up the mess and we had to ask the bus boy to bring us new napkins &amp; plates. Â That was a rather irritating start so I&#39;m glad the food was delicious to even out their star rating. Â The second gripe was regarding the small basket of tortilla chips &amp; a bean dip they bring you when you sit down. Â We finished our chips &amp; still had half the bean dip left. Â The bus boy took away our empty basket for chips &amp; left the bean dip but never brought any more chips. Â I did overhear another table asking for chips so perhaps you have to ask? Just not sure why they wouldn&#39;t ask us if we wanted more chips (most servers at other places ask), especially if they are going to leave the bean dip on the table.After all is said and done I probably wouldn&#39;t bother going back. Â Good to give them a try, at least, though."bien-trucha-geneva-2,Mary M.,WarQXYvmdrkcuIqj1BXHNw,"Oswego, IL",0,1,0,0,56,1kdkOAz2rFfrRTVo_KKyBQ,3,21/10/16,"Yummy food!!!! It is pricey but delicious!

This place is very small so if you aren&#39;t a fan of siting close together for dinner, I suggest visiting during patio season, there&#39;s a little more room out there. They start off your dining experience by bring a bean dip with chips. The bean dip seems to have a hint of chipotle and is tasty. The pepino margarita they have is too good. It is pricey, but it&#39;s one of those things that you don&#39;t feel guilty splurging on because it&#39;s delicious. The guacamole is a must. They do have a special guacamole (Guacamole del Dia) where fresh fruit is added, by chef&#39;s choice and we always try it and have never been disappointed. The tacos are flavorful and have unique combinations on them.( I would not describe them as authentic mexican tacos at all, but more of a taco with a modern twist) The Arrachera tacos are one of my favorites. It&#39;s steak with onions, avocado and salsa. If you don&#39;t mind paying a little more for a upscale feel, then this is the place for you.

After spending a relaxing Saturday afternoon in the area, we decided to venture over to Geneva and try our luck. Without reservations, we got in line around 4:30 for their 5 o&#39;clock dinner opening. Great timing as we were the third group in line. The weather was perfect to sit outside in their outdoor dining area under the canopy. Once 5:00 pm came, the line was to the end of the block. I was just hoping that the tacos lived up to the hype!Once we were seated, our server got right to work, greeting us and offering information about their specials. I ordered a watermelon margarita for myself and the traditional guacamole for the table. We ordered tacos to share and decided on shrimp, tuna and chicken. The tacos came in orders of 4.At first, our food came almost immediately, and I had the feeling that because this restaurant is so busy, we would be rushed out in order to turn over the table for the next guests. That could have been the case but our order of chicken tacos took an extremely long time. That was fine by us as we were there to enjoy the atmosphere and the beautiful weather.This place is definitely a low key restaurant with more of an upscale, fine dining feel than one would expect at first glance. I&#39;d say the tacos were worth the wait.

So when I first crunched into a magnificently, impossibly fresh tuna taco adorned with baby arugula, celery aioli and avocado at Bien Trucha, an unassuming little joint on the edge of downtown Geneva, every expletive I knew shot through my head within a nanosecond. And the bill for guac, twelve tacos and four margaritas came to just about $80. (I wasn&#39;t dining alone, I swear!)As I munched on house-made totopos and that exemplary guacamole, freshened with the tang of tomatillo, I thought, &#34;Could Rick Bayless somehow be behind this?&#34;Nope. Turns out Mexico City-bred chef/owner Ricardo Garcia-Rubio, although a decades-long kitchen vet, had never garnered any kind of real attention or seen much success before opening Bien Trucha in 2007. Now, eight years later, after an expansion and much local and national acclaim, it seems Chef is right where he needs to be.He&#39;s certainly farther away from Lakeview than I&#39;d like; I would eat at Bien almost every week if he were within a five-mile radius. I randomly crave those tuna tacos. Other times my mouth waters at the thought of crunchy tortillas stacked with juicy, epazote-scented swordfish and avocado-chile pico de gallo. Even the skirt steak tacos, slightly overshadowed by the oceanic treats, pop into mind. I even miss the simple but ridiculously addictive white rice, dotted with bits of roasted poblano and creamy-gooey with crema and Chihuahua cheese.My only complaint aside from distance is that the margaritas, while delicious (especially the cucumber &#34;Pepino&#34;), are rather small and low on booze. I may prefer my tequila drinks more bracing than most people, but these might not do the job for even the lightest-weight lightweight in your group.I suppose that means that, pocketbook permitting, you ought to have an extra cocktail. The experience is otherwise worth savoring."bien-trucha-geneva-2,Janine M.,OWFPuFAt2yQMei91GihUwg,"Chicago, IL",0,1,0,153,2,nbiq_qyVTU_3ImxbAEpwdw,4,08/08/16,"So much YUM!

One restaurant is for reservations and the other is seated on a first come first serve basis. I would strongly suggest that you make reservations as soon as possible as they get booked fast and sometimes it can take a month to reserve a prime time on a Friday or Saturday.We always have a large group and so we usually order pretty much everything on the menu. The drinks are phenomenal! My favorite of them all is the Ahuacatl. They give you complimentary homemade chips and bean dip and a must order is the salsa trio and the traditional guacamole. Another must order are the side dishes of rice and corn and the pescado tacos. I make it my mission to try fish tacos across the country and these are my favorite by far.

They need to change that so i can try different things. Then they need to make more unique tacos still the same ones.Free appetizer: Â its frizoles and chips the chips are fresh not greasy seasoned well the beans are really good i just eat all the cheeze in it then i stop not to get too foolCeviche del mes: i ordered this twice both completely different the first time it was really unique sometjing i never had before this time it was more traditional but still amazing its gormea so it has high quality ingredients in it then i love the salad in the bottom its not diluted Â with water like alot of mexican restaurants must order!Cazulita de camarones: this is the best dish here its so good the shrimp are cooked perfectly the sauce is really rich but a lil sour the perfect balance. The cheese underneath is to die for its so good its like a mexican fondue i wish they put more shrimp in it though u have to order thisBarriga de puerco: this was really good the sauce was really good to but i like my pork belly fried and its not friedPescado taco: this was the best taco i have ever eaten its perfectly fried really crispy not greasy perfectly cooked not overcooked or dried seasoned really well the coleslaw is so fricken good adds so much richness to make it so decadent.Atun taco: its really crispy but not greasy seasoned really nicely the sauce was really good i wish there was more surprised there was alot of tuna fish the salad on top was really good just wish that there was coleslaw instead Â really good thoughSoup: crema de chile poblano: omg this was so fucking good i didnt expect anything of it i just ordered it cause it was cheap wow did this have so much flavor it was so rich one of the best soups i ever had it had a lil bit of smokey flavor not alot perfect for cold days comes with bread but i used the chips for crunch. Theres cheeze and potatoes at the bottom needs more thoughBrocheta de carne: its a mexican shish kabob. It was cookd perfectly it was medium rare and the vetables werent overcooked wasnt to burned either the dipping cause was good could be better though it needed salt though the seasoning wasnt that good wouldnt order againEnchiladas: umm this was my least favorite it was way to sweet was more like a dessert. And tasted like the can mole to be honest idk if they used it but tasted really similar to it.Mexican Corn appetizer: i love mexican corn but this wasnt really that good it needed sAlt jus had no wow factor i had betterArrachera taco: this was my least favorite taco it was to plain i tasted almost everything off the menu and this had no wow factor the bien trucha is a way better steak taco i wouldnt order this againBien trucha taco: this was my favorite steak taco here its so good. The steak is cooked perfectly supper tender and flavorful. I love the cheese theres alot which is good. Then the salsa on top is so delicous not spicy just the right balance. Then theres chorizo on it which makes it even better not burned! Or really greasy.Oysters: really fresh really delicious just i wish there was more condiments like horshradish theres just a black sauce and a red sauce needs a wow factorChurros: this was my least favorite thing i ate here they were overfried and no sugar or cinnamon on any of them i had to ask for it.Key lime pie: i hate key lime pie i dont really like things really sour but this was so fucking good it wasnt sour at all Â the icecream was perfect not overturned not to sweet perfect texture. The crust at the bottom was supper crispy added alot of texture then theres Â meringue that is blow torched so good not to sweet. Must orderCorn cake: u have to order this one of the best desserts of my life u have to order this supper moist and flavorful the sauce is to die for theres tequila in it that really enhances the flavor of the cake its amaizing u have to get it"bien-trucha-geneva-2,Krystal C.,MvLY5flczjYVGiCKiSpevg,"Plano, IL",0,1,0,29,11,LuP619rij0RdJUSZPw321g,4.5,11/04/16,"Tapas-style restaurants are a new discovery for me. Now, I&#39;m on a mission to try them ALL! I had heard about Bien Trucha being similar to Altiro Latin Fusion. I loved Altiro so I had to give this one a try. My boyfriend made reservations here for 8:15 on a Saturday night. The location is convenient and the two buildings are a cute idea. We arrived about 15 mins early and our table wasn&#39;t ready yet (which was fine). We just weren&#39;t aware at how small the inside was. We were left standing by the door dodging out of the server&#39;s way. On a busy Saturday night, there&#39;s really no room for people waiting for tables. Which may be the charm of it all...?Anyway, we were seated soon enough and the atmosphere was loud and lively. No complaints. There was music in the background. Dining here kind of feels like you&#39;re in the inner city somewhere. The servers were busy so there wasn&#39;t much talk besides taking our order which is fine. They did bring out complimentary chips and bean dip. So good and so fresh. That was a nice treat. We started with the Cazuelita de camarones. I have to say, these are delicious, however, Altiro has a similar dish and I did enjoy it more there. For our entrees, we ordered the tacos de pastor and tacos de bien trucha. The pastor tacos were too spicy for me but if you like spicy then you&#39;ll love these. The bien trucha tacos were the best bite of the night. They were full of flavor and left you wanting more. I&#39;d definitely like to come back especially during warmer weather to sit out in the patio. :)"bien-trucha-geneva-2,Kassandra B.,Jr3IsH5KsTBDlkCjUa0nOw,"Carol Stream, IL",0,1,0,1,31,TbhEWgMwq7IadTTnRueLYA,4,21/07/16,"Our party of 5 came out for a dinner and it was great!

When I asked our waitress if they could make it &#34;virgin&#34; she said that they can&#39;t because they want to keep the consistency the same with all their drinks/food. What?! The funny thing is they would make me another special drink that was nonalcoholic but add mint for $1.00....does that make sense at all?!

We ordered the guacamole as I tend to judge a place like this based solely on how fresh it is. NICELY done. We actually watched them prepare it. My wife ordered the special. Yellowfin snapper that was butterflied and grilled. Simply seasoned and perfect. Grilled lemon was a nice touch. Came with a red cabbage salad and tortillas. Delicious.I ordered the Pastor tacos.

It&#39;s hard to live up to the hype of the 29 Zagat score posted at the door and all the other reviews you have surely read below, but I&#39;m here to tell you it was far exceeded.

The Sopa De Calabasa was also very interesting because it came in a shot glass looking cup which was a really original was in it own to give out soup, Finally the best part of it all was the paellas, there were 2 different types, Arroz Negro Con Mariscos and Paella De Pollo. Thee Paella de pollo was very nice it was just a bit salty.

The full experience is 2 stars at best. But this review is only about our dinner beforehand at El Tapeo, which was a good 4-star experience.We really enjoyed everything! The menu was prix fixe and my date and I chose different items and we both loved everything we had picked. Portions were large (we went home with leftovers) and the beverages were tasty. We loved the variety the menu offered (definitely something for everyone!) and our choices were deliiiiicious.My picks included:-Appetizer -- Ensalada de Pera: a baby spinach salad with rioja wine poached pears, blue cheese, and toasted almonds. This was AWESOME. And huge! It was served on a dinner plate [see pic].-Entree -- Carne Asada: 3 pieces of skirt steak (which was melt in your mouth tender and perfectly medium rare like I requested) with tons of arugula, a flavorful piquillo pepper sauce, and covered in manchego cheese. This was also awesome! A really flavorful steak dish. Loved it.-Dessert -- Panna Cotta de Coco: this left more to be desired. It wasn&#39;t very sweet and overall was just ok. Beautifull presented coconut panna cotta with pieces of an olive oil cake, pineapple, and thin hazelnut tuile pieces.We also enjoyed red and white wine sangria during our dinner and it was delightful! Full of fruit, not overly sweet but very flavorful, and served to the top of a large wine glass.The atmosphere is really nice, too. El Tapeo is located on the 9th floor of Le Meridien hotel. The far side is filled with tables, but the bar area has low couches for a lounge vibe. It would be both a great place to grab dinner or just drinks!Overall, we really enjoyed the meal here!

Â Their menu, while it isn&#39;t expansive, has a decent selection of quality tapas, salads, a handful of entrees &amp; charcuterie/fromage platter options (that&#39;s fancy talk for a meat &amp; cheese tray, hehe) to choose from. Â They also have a large wine menu and a variety of cocktails &amp; beers to wet your whistle.Our server, Joe, was great, and the service was cordial and attentive with several other staff members seamlessly working as a team to bring out our dishes, etc. Â Our water glasses never went below half-full and I was asked if I would like another glass of wine just before I had finished my first glass (lately most other places either never ask me once my wine glass is empty or they say they&#39;ll bring me another &amp; then forget). Â Our food selections were very quite delicious and we tried the charcuterie/fromage platter (we selected 2 meats &amp; 2 cheeses from the choices &amp; it came with some bread/crackers, honeycomb, almonds, olives &amp; some little peppers), the shrimp croquettes, tuna foie gras and the lump crab meat salad. Â These were all tapas so the servings were smaller of course but just the right amount to share and try a variety of things without feeling overstuffed. Â The prices on what we ordered, for the most part, was reasonable compared with other tapas places, though I think the lump crab salad was a bit much at $18 for 1/3 Cup of crab salad. But everything was very good!"el-tapeo-oak-brook-2,Jason A.,R8uSvYXD-HRXdSm-DxffTg,"Orland Park, IL",0,1,0,0,35,S3yjZ5O_Gok63Yz3TVoroQ,4,28/08/16,"My wife and I went here on a Saturday night to grab some drinks and appetizers and it was great. Â We sat at the bar so we did not get a chance to enjoy the view from the 9th floor but the restaurant is very simple, yet contemporary and the food was excellent. Â We tried just about everything on the tapas menu and everything tasted amazing. Â I do have some food allergies (gluten and dairy) and the young lady that helped us was so good about making sure all of the food was prepared properly.If you are in the Oak Brook area, I would highly recommend this restaurant if you like tapas."el-tapeo-oak-brook-2,Jennifer L.,M3gTDFvnLE9GK2RGpuFwIA,"Darien, IL",0,1,1,3,50,PkAUgWtK_c0OMgwSFzqzFA,5,01/08/16,"Getting right to it- the gambas were fantastic and the sauce they&#39;re served in is delicious. The datiles and albondigas weren&#39;t anything special and I regret ordering the atun foie gras as I don&#39;t think the flavors went well together and the lemon/olive combo completely overpowered the dish. The crema catalana and leche frita we had for dessert were very good, but the star of the meal was the charcuterie board we ordered. You can pick a combination of any 4 meats/cheeses and it&#39;s served with bread, whole grain mustard, olives, and honeycomb.It was nice that we didn&#39;t have to make a reservation on a Friday night, but I don&#39;t think they&#39;re used to being busy, as it seemed like the servers got completely overwhelmed when there were more than 5 tables. I agree with others that the views are great and it&#39;s a nice spot for a date night. We came here because we wanted to try something new and I don&#39;t regret coming, but I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be back. The food was good, but a little expensive at $85 for 5 small plates, 2 desserts, and a cappuccino.

Some of the portions are very small for the high price. The taste was great I just think that tapas were meant to be shared and some of the dishes were for one person. I have been to great tapas restaurants which are great in taste and portion. One thing I did not like is that when the plates were brought to the table they were not called by the name on the menu.

Huh?The food is average to bland. I wouldn&#39;t eat here again.We ordered a fired pepper thing that must have been a special as I don&#39;t see it when I reviewed the menu to write this review... bland, just no flavor at all.The &#34;meat and cheese&#34; board was ok, not amazing. The tiny lamb meatballs were ok but a strange not so good tasting bright orange sauce was served with them.We love bacon wrapped dates- who who fries them, instead of baking? The others on the menu were fried. Â we inquired about it - not no good answer and decided to insist they were baked, despite it taking longer in the kitchen. The dates did have flavor and were pretty good but can&#39;t imagine them fired."el-tapeo-oak-brook-2,Tiffany P.,9yccZkhkCpIoZsX7sY5Fpg,"Downers Grove, IL",1,1,1,224,140,FaD95qogezF7jPMprDqHhQ,2,11/09/15,"This is one of the coolest places for date night in the western burbs. Way up in the Le Meridian hotel, it totally has a downtown Chicago feel. There are windows all around, a fancy bar, and low-to-the-ground lounge couches and chairs.The staff is very good from my experiences here. I like how attentive and personable they are, being friendly and starting conversations.I can speak to some of the tapas and dishes. Seafood paella- awesome! So many different shellfish including muscles, clams, shrimp, and lobster, and it had great fresh seasoning! I would also recommend the dates- a classic Spanish tapas dish.The gambas were good shrimp, but a little TOO garlicy. I didn&#39;t realize that &#34;garlic chips&#34; were actually slices of garlic cloves! It looked like shredded cabbage to me on top of the shrimp, and I ate a whole pile of them! LOL, that was the biggest dose of garlic that I&#39;ve had in my entire life. I will never have to worry about my cholesterol with that one down the hatch.Their drinks are awesome here, which is the reason why I return. The mixed drinks are delicious, unique, and stiff. The sangria is home-made and some of the best I&#39;ve ever had with a fresh, crisp flavor. I love the red sangria; the white is good too, but the red is the best.Overall, I would definitely recommend el Tapeo for drinks and tapas.

I think my favorite was the crab meat on toast points. Yum!I did want to try a few other offerings from the menu so we ordered the lamb meat balls and bacon wrapped dates. Everything was delicious!I tried both sangria flavors. The white was sweet and light. The red was dry (I asked they make it with Cab). Both were good.

I suspect it was at the front hotel entrance but we parked in the free garage and saved a bit. Then we spent it all on food!We started off our meal with a magnificent cheese/meat spread with some crunchies. I simply adored it. I know my reviews are getting a bit repetitious because I get this type of app so many places but it was magnificent.During this time the restaurant was slowly filling up but never did it get really noisy. By coming early we also had a great table by the window with a view of, well, the street. Still it was fun!For the entree, my husband and I split the paella. Have I mentioned how much I love paella? This one was a great one to share, not too small, not too big. We ate every morsel.We had play tickets at Drury Lane at 8:00 so we left without having dessert or coffee about 7:15 as we had to walk to the garage, drive about 500 feet, repark, etc. As it was our first time at Drury Lane, we wanted to be sure to be on time, etc. Now that we know the routine, we can leave a bit later or come a bit earlier.I want to try their desserts and those 1,000 points were pretty fabulous as well."el-tapeo-oak-brook-2,Nadia S.,lFc_RXY4lLpghA_ScbbAzA,"Naperville, IL",1,1,1,74,60,yLVh1kdjXY26pCu2VtwMUw,5,18/08/15,"Came for a yelp event for el tapeo&#39;s one year anniversary.

Perfect way to get the night started.The paraisa (habiscus infused vodka drink) was amazing and had a hint of elder berry liqueur in it. HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDWe tried the patatas bravas which were perfectly crisp and delightful. The PULPO or octopus was cooked to perfection with a slight charred black pepper taste and fresh melt in your mouth inside. Served with a side of cilantro paste which was elegant and spicy!The mushroom fritters or Croquetas de Setas were my favorite on the menu as they were light, crispy, smooth on the inside, very fine chopped and soothing mushrooms, and served my personal favorite cilantro yogurt which definitely hit the spot.The pimientos or shishito peppers were amazing. Very light and an easy way to ease into the meal. I recommend this plate as a nice way to start your night.Gambas or shrimp were buttery and extremely fresh. I am a big fan of garlic and the addition of garlic chips mixed with a slight cilantro finish was an amazing touch.Our wait staff was courteous, friendly, helpful, and very accommodating. Server even brought us desert on the house which was a cinnamon brandy glazed ice-cream with ginger infused pineapples and 2 churro donuts.

I am usually confused when it comes to tapas, I liken it to my experience at taco bell, I end up tacking on 3-5 things I don&#39;t need but end up eating anyways.

Tips are an acknowledgement for great service for the time spent at that very moment. But when people stop in there busy life and make a point on how great of an experience they had that means something. There&#39;s a reason why the El Tapeo Restaurant is the best Hidden Gem in the Western Suburbs. They there cuisine is exceptional and they know there clientele. Because the restaurant is in a hotel the audience varies from travelers who are away from home and are looking for a place to feel comfortable and the locals who know they have found there special place. It&#39;s obivous that management knows how to accomidate for both.There are plenty of &#34;Branded&#34; Restaurants in the Oak Brook Mall, which is fine. It&#39;s not until you find that &#34;Hidden Gem&#34; and you don&#39;t want to disclose the location in fear you won&#39;t get in. Sorry, El Tapeo for giving you up!On a second note I want to acknowledge the LeMeridian. My last visit was a 4 day stay and all I can say is I felt like I was part of the family. Everyone remembered my name and was so accommodating. If you are from the area looking for a weekend escape or traveling I would recommend the LeMeridian Oak Brook.

That&#39;s all I have to say about our experience at El Tapeo!OK I don&#39;t know where to start so I&#39;ll just start from the beginning. First for a Saturday night in Oakbrook parking was just a dream, we parked in the parking garage right behind the Le Meridien hotel found a spot very easily got out and proceeded into the hotel passing the El Tapeo sign outside. When we got in we followed the red and yellow paint colors on the pillars, I&#39;m assuming since they were the colors of the sign they were directing us to the restaurant. After a short elevator ride we reached the 9th floor.We&#39;re here! The elevator doors opened the sound of some techno and deep house music played by the resident dj. We were immediately greeted by the cutest little hostess, she informed us that our table would be ready in a few mins. No problem cause we always show up early for our reservations. We then proceeded to the bar for pre dinner cocktails. I had the old fashion because well, I&#39;m old fashioned, she had the sangria. The bartenders were very nice.There was a man and a woman working behind the bar, they seemed very busy but were very attentive. The old fashion had just the right amount of sweet to it and didn&#39;t overpower the bourbon at all. My wife said the Red Sangria was, just right. The drinks were $13 each but well worth it cause some obvious care was put into making these cocktail. The lounge was pretty full with a nice ambiance.The hostess came over to tell us our table was ready.We thanked the bartenders for their service and closed out our check.We were seated right by the window with a view of the Chicago skyline in the distance. We were greeted promptly by a young lady who asked if we had been here before? No we replied. She was very informative, told us that everything was served family style and proceeded to tell us the specials for the evening.We started with the shishito peppers the gambas and the bacon wrapped dates, which I have to say were my personal favorite, it was nice to see them fried for a change it gives the bacon that extra crisp as opposed to baking them.The wine list was a nice size not too overwhelming and priced just right. We ordered a bottle of Prisoner red blend.We then ordered the Pata Negra Jamon which was a little pricy but hey you only live once. It was brought out by a man who identified himself as one of the sous chefs and sliced table side with greatest of ease. It was very good and just melted in our mouths.For dinner we had the cobia and the Paella. Everything was totally on point the cooks had everything perfect that night. It was a delicious seafood treat.A man then came by, told us he was the manager, asked us how everything was, and told us to enjoy our night.We finished the dinner with yet another glass of wine and the Leche Frita kind of like fried ice cream but far more delectable.We then payed our bill and continued back to the lounge where we danced the night away with cocktails in hand.Overall a very good experience. Everything was perfect from the hostess to the bar, servers, bussboys, cooks etc... I highly recommend this place!

The Octopus is a room temperature dish with a creamy potato topping. Some may think it&#39;s on the salty side...but I liked it! Â The cheese plate was also great with a variety of bleu, goat, manchego, fig, and olives. Also, a dark colored mustard came with the cheese plate.

The ensalada de pera was a good choice in salads, but the ensalada de tomate was not impressive and I was disappointed in the fried avocado. For entrees the carne asada was too dry, but the Cordero was quite good. Neither the remolachas or the patatas bravas were worth ordering again. For desert we had the leche frita, which is worth getting again.

Â Ambiance was nice, very well decorated and the bar area is very trendy, though the live music was a bit loud for its close location to the bar - maybe turn the speakers down a bit? Â In fairness, it was a Saturday night, and the music was not so loud once we were seated because the tables are farther away.The food was OK good; tapas dishes were flavorful but nothing had an over-the-top wow factor, just good. Â We ordered the bacon and pumpkin croquettes, which were good but not super terrific; then the fingerling potatoes, which were the best of any hot tapa we ordered. Â The Gambas, like the croquettes, were good but not great. Â Also ordered a very good salami tapas, which left me wishing we had ordered more of the many cured meats options.Here&#39;s the bad news - the paella was really not that good, and for a Spanish restaurant, that seems unforgiveable to me. Â The seafood was all steamed separately from the rice and chorizo base, so that none of the seafood had any flavor of the paella. Â This is not the way to make paella, people. Â Also, the rice base almost had a risotto texture of creaminess, instead of a crumbly consistency as true paella should have. Â Overall, this was a big miss.Second miss was the service.

Â The clientele is also attractive, such as it is after a day of shopping at the posh stores of Oak Brook Center.We ordered a selection of menu items to share.

Â Better was the octopus terrine, a beautifully conceived dish of tender octopus, creamed potato and chili oil.We shared one dessert, the cheesecake.

Â He was really enthusiastic and so helpful! Â Definitely a keeper!Included with our delicious beef catering order was the softest French bread I&#39;ve ever had, more than enough sweet peppers &amp; mouth-watering giardiniera, serving utensils for *everything,* PLUS forks, knives, plates, - all the stuff you never ask for but realize you need at the last minute! Â A lot of places charge extra for these niceties; Â Patellis viewed them asnecessities, and it really helped a lot during the last-minute serving melee.For years I&#39;ve ordered beef from both Portillo&#39;s (10% - I find it too fatty) and Augustino&#39;s (90% - I love their spices) and I will say if Patelli&#39;s keeps doing what it&#39;s doing, they will eventually rule the area Italian Beef catering game.I have never been happier with an Italian Beef catering order, and there just aren&#39;t enough stars."luong-loi-wheaton-3,Wanchen V.,wtfTwCI1VlhkFtbGt4y0gQ,"Chicago, IL",1,1,1,3,176,P7JVTlxizDnAjo6xhXXrIw,4.5,27/08/16,"It&#39;s so far the best Vietnamese place in Wheaton.

A couple weeks ago, I was messing around with the Yelp app, searching for new and hot businesses around the area and I happened to stumble upon this place. I was so excited, the first thing I did was texted one of my friends and told her that we need to check this place out. We ended up going here the following weekend. The new location is literally across the street from the old one. I really like the interior designs of this place. It seems so much bigger and cleaner compares to the old one.We started off with Spring Rolls and it was decent. It was not OMG amazing, but at the same time, it was not horrible. I actually prefer the Spring Rolls at Green Basil a little bit more. However, I actually like the Com Suon Nuong at this place a lot more. The Com Suon Nuong comes with a pork chop and shredded pork. For a dollar more, you can add an egg or the Vietnamese sausages. Two of my friends ended up ordering the soups. They said the soups were decent, however, the soups itself were not hot enough. I would definitely come back to this place again and give the Walnut Shrimp a try."luong-loi-wheaton-3,Minh-An C.,p4dved0OUoh-lKaXSTdCXA,"Chicago, IL",1,1,1,920,63,omGfA3N2OpH8CN7qhnz21A,4,28/05/16,"Lunch special daily until 2:30 for only $8 comes with egg drop soup, egg roll, veggie fried rice, and a stir fry/meat dish of your choice. I got the shrimp and broccoli option and it was a bit too salty for my liking. The egg drop soup and egg roll was really yummy but the fried rice was a bit dry and too salty. I love their Vietnamese iced coffee here so definitely get that if you need some caffeine in your system.The rice platter w/ the pork and a fried egg on top is a favorite among my friends and I. It is super filling and worth the price (~$11). The pho is okay, nothing spectacular but it gets the job done if you are hungover.Service is great and the price is reasonable.

The wait seemed to take forever but it was worth it. Luckily their food is just as great as before with the exception of the mongolian beef. This time it tasted fishy, like someone went overboard with the oyster sauce. So that was a disappointment. My only other complaint was it&#39;s pretty cold inside. I get it, heat is expensive, but I want to be comfortable and relax when dining out. Hopefully it was an anomaly as I would hate to have to avoid the place until it warms up outside.Now for the good stuff - I love that each dish now comes with its own side of rice. In the past when we order multiple dishes, they&#39;d bring them out with just a plate of rice and not offer to bring more. This time we ordered four dishes because we were so excited they were back in business and wanted to enjoy the food for multiple meals. Each dish came with it&#39;s own rice so we didn&#39;t have to make our own at home. I also like that they now have lunch specials every day of the week. We will definitely take advantage of that since my favorite dish, Kung Pao chicken, is on the that list.Visited - 12/19/15"luong-loi-wheaton-3,Kat D.,dMrwEzuh8-ALhT5AxU_XWQ,"Lombard, IL",1,1,0,33,39,CXD4vHEfyLsV0Kh-LSK7_w,5,27/12/15,"Tis the season to be jolly...Pho, pho, pho, pho, phoooooo.Yes, ladies and gents, they officially REOPENED!!

BUT NOW at the new location just across the street, Luong Loi is an Asian restaurant I am proud to bring visitors to!

First, we had been frequenting this establishment&#39;s original location for years, where the atmosphere was a dive, but the food and service were always very good. We were so looking forward to their new location across the street. Tried this new site several times, where there is almost an upscale atmosphere, still good food, but the service has gone from an A- to an F. Those first visits we chalked it up to being unprepared for increased business at the new location/ until last night! Saturday night, yes it&#39;s busy but no wait for a table. My husband, son and I arrive at 6:05 and order within 5 minutes with the older gentleman/owner, who never returns. Receive drinks reasonably quickly, then wait until 7:05 - one hour- for one appetizer to arrive, lemongrass beef skewers, which must have been sitting in the kitchen so long, they were absolutely cold. Ate those as we were starving by now. At 7:20 my son and I receive our meals, with no food or server in site for my husband. Wait 10 more minutes, get up and chase down 2 staff about missing meal, no apologies, just , &#34;We&#39;re busy.&#34; Still no food or server EVER arrives for my husband. At 7:40, I get up again, chase down apathetic server, request to pay for our 2 uneaten meals and cold appetizer - minus my husband&#39;s invisible meal, still no apology, and leave, all the while not even able to have a conversation due to the terrible noise level of the place.ADVICE: Save the aggravation/miserable experience and head over to Simply Thai Bistro on Liberty St. for an excellent meal with great attentive service and relaxing atmosphere. This will be our go-to place from now on. I only hope this review is read by the first establishment and taken to heart in order to improve its lack of service and caring, but I doubt it.

We really thought nothing of it at first and chocked it up to being a busy night.The second time we ordered we told them in advance about our past experience with the toppings and they apologized. We ordered a plain cheese pizza duo. When it arrived the entire pizza was covered with a grated romano cheese which we neither ordered nor expected because our first pizza did not come with it. We were not too pleased since neither my husband nor I liked the taste. We called back and spoke to a manager. He put a credit for the value of another pizza on our account.The third time we ordered we used one of the web coupons for an X-large pizza. Again we ordered 2 toppings and told the order taker about our past experience with sparse toppings. They applied our coupon and account credit. About two minutes later the general manager called us back and told us he could not accept both the coupon and the account credit. Okay, that&#39;s fine. But really? Call us back and take the $2 coupon away? He should have just let it go and then told his employee not to do that again.Again, when the pizza arrived we had very sparse toppings - probably worse than the first time.We are never ordering here again.

Â  Â I have had the honor of introducing this to many newbies and first timers, who were simply amazed. All of the entrees tried over perhaps a dozen visits have been outstanding, notably: Cashew chicken, Five Star Chicken, Nutty Chicken, Pepper Steak, Basil Fried Rice, Pad Kee Mao (my personal favorite) and Crab Fried Rice. Desserts are unusual and very pretty looking. Surprisingly they are have some interesting martini creations too.

Have only had take out but every time it has been stellar. Pad Woon Sen has the most flavorful sauce I have ever had with that dish anywhere, I love it!!! The basil fried rice has a nice peppery bite but is balanced by the savory flavors cooked into the rice. My wife ordered the pepper steak tonight and I tried it and it was quite honestly the best pepper steak I have ever had. I love Thai food, this place takes Thai food and elevates the flavor beyond what I have had in recent years. Also the avocado roll appetizer is also amazing. The crunchiness of the fried roll gives way to a burst of deliciousness!!! I was highly impressed by those. From all I have tried here I would say the theme that comes across is balance. In all their dishes, not one flavor overpowers another, they just meld together and are bright enough to complement one another without stealing the show. Seriously impressed! Their TomYom soup is also phenomenal.

We were seated promptly and given menus to look over.I almost always order the Pad Kee Mao (spicy flat rice noodles) when I first visit a Thai spot.

Â What I know is, whatever food I tried was good so I&#39;m going to give Montri the benefit of the doubt here. Â Really the two major issues were that the service was really slow. Â We waited a LONG time just to get our appetizers like avocado rolls and soup. Â That was excessive, but again maybe the issue was the size of our group, 8 adults and 6 kids. Â The other issue my friends complained about was the sweetness of the food. Â Many entrees came out quite sweet, which wasn&#39;t ideal.I tried a couple of things. Â First off, the avocado rolls were great. Â Almost like a Tex/Mex-Asian fusion thing going on. Â Really nice. Â On the other hand, the Tom Kha soup was... not what I expected. Â Not that it was bad, but it just didn&#39;t taste like the Tom Kha soup I have almost everywhere else. Â I&#39;m all for unique flavors, but this just seemed like a whole different kind of soup. Â Really, the soup was my only complaint. Â The red curry was great and the Pad Kee Mao was good. Â I think we could and should have upped the spice levels on everything we ordered.

Â If you had any question about it - the service is TOP NOTCH!We arrived hoping to finish dinner by the closing time we thought was 9 (actually 10) on a Friday. Â The place wasn&#39;t too full, but the decor and setup is very clean and modern while still being comfy. Â We took a bit of extra time to order since we wanted to scan the whole menu to see what they had to offer, and the waitress was extremely polite and not bugging us, but attentive none the less.We ordered some Thai Tea that really stuck to your gums. Â The very good flavor hung around in your mouth if you let it. Â Then we decided on some Tom Kha Kai which came in a plenty large enough bowl to share (but not too large as to leave you groaning). Â The flavor was very good but there was an interesting aspect - bell peppers. Â It wasn&#39;t bad, but it was unfamiliar for the dish (as well as a couple of others). Â Probably just something to get used to.We also had the Pad See Eiw which was delicious, but the noodles may have been fried too much (unless they started with a different wide noodle than I&#39;m used to) as they were a bit too hard to cut with a fork and or spoon. Â We commented to the waiter and he said he would tell the chef and thanked us for our opinion. Â The dish also had broccoli instead of collard greens, but the flavor was great either way.The other dish we ordered was the spicy catfish. Â It was a very good mixture of red curry and coconut milk with a spice that I thought I was going to need to spice up at first, but set in to the perfect cruise to spice town.When the waiter went to wrap up our food he noticed that we did not have much rice and, without asking, packed a nice, full extra container for us to take. Â Awesome!I really liked the lounge-style oldies that were playing the whole time we were there (Beatles, Doors, Steely Dan, etc) and the waiter also noted that they will be featuring live jazz once a month (2nd Friday?) and possibly more often if it is popular.

I have been to Thailand, know the food and even speak it. We ordered some very basic carry out and it was mediocre at best. The pad Thai was tasteless as was the fried rice. Real Thai food uses fish sauce. Especially in pad Thai and fried rice. I don&#39;t understand Thai restaurants owned by Thai people that have lousy food, especially to a culture where food is so important. This did not have that Thai flavor. Crab Rangoon (which isn&#39;t Thai but who cares) was ok. I normally get joy Yees but they are temporarily closed. I will not order from here again.

The place was already very busy at 7, not so much with golfers coming off the links, but with diners who made &#34;22&#34; their target for the evening. A loud boisterous crowd filled the dining room, the large bar, and most of the terrace. Video screens covered sports of the day.Service was very attentive, and there was plenty of staff to handle the large crowd as well as keep problems down and service up.&#34;22&#34; is not the usual clubhouse dining. A long list of craft and specialty beers, and wines, are offered. They do have typical soup/salad/sandwich menus, but also an interesting list of small plates and sides, from $3 to about $15. A limited list of plate dinners ran mostly below $20. We had chicken linguini w/artichokes and bistro steak w/truffle/parmigiana fries. The steak was no filet but was well prepared and nicely dressed with a savory, slightly tangy sauce. The fries were to die for! I devoured the whole mountain of them. The chicken pasta, a large serving, was very good and included several dried tomato slices. Sides are extra.The noisy crowd diminished about 9PM and management went to great efforts to move the band, and pull out some tables, for those who stayed for the entertainment and dancing until 11.While not gourmet dining (3*), and the noise is not our thing, prices are modest, Â the food offerings are creative, the mood is up-beat, and service very attentive (management gets a 5*).

Both were flavorful and delicious!! Some of the best I&#39;ve had in the Chicagoland area. The green curry was creamy coconutty goodness with thinly sliced bamboo shoots, peas, and peppers. Both dishes also had just the right amount of heat to balance out the sweet and creamy.

It seemed that almost everybody was waiting for food. Even people for carry out waited much longer than what seemed necessary. Â  After 30 minutes with no visit from the waitress, no comment that they might have been short-handed, or anything...we finally just walked out and left.

My husband is gluten and dairy free, so I sold him on the rice noodles and peanut oil in Thai food.We have been back twice and loved everything we have tried. I adore the mango lobster roll appetizers, which are spring rolls with a peanut sauce you can spoon on yourself. I&#39;ve had the baby corn and peapod and trio delight entrees and they were both delicious. My partner had pad thai chicken and some kind of coconut curry with shrimp and pineapple that he raved about. The Jasmine iced tea is refreshing and light, too.The banana dessert reminded me of overcooked oatmeal, but there is so much delicious food, I can skip dessert. :) I will definitely be going back often and we noticed they do a brisk carryout business, so we are looking forward to having a new carryout place that is on my way home from work."montri-thai-warrenville,Genni O.,T0OvHGYz9aGulHZ4bWrrsQ,"Chicago, IL",0,1,0,4,1189,HTTpqyZeqktkFfUOzP-QeA,5,28/07/14,"After hearing the glowing reviews on this place coupled with the fact that I have found no good thai in the western suburbs, I decided to roll the dice. Called in a pick-up order and was bringing food back to some friends who own a nearby business. Upon arriving, I liked the interior and the people were friendly, but when I got the food back, I was shocked to see what was being portrayed as thai food. Got a few noodle dishes and a bunch of apps. NONE was good and none was remotely close to authentic. One step up from food court sweet and sour chicken at the mall really. Ask for spicy, and you get a 1/2 cup of red pepper flakes thrown in at the end type of crap - and the crazy thing is that people like this junk.

Yelp, I hate to be the dissenter but I fear that I must say that Montri is carrying on Ariya&#39;s mediocre tradition.Why? Due to pretty much everything we ordered. For an appetizer we split the Blue Sea Crispy Rolls. For a dish that claimed to contain a combo of lobster, crab, shrimp, and scallop along with carrot, cabbage and bean threads, I have to say that the seafood was almost undetectable. The taste wasn&#39;t bad for what it was, but what it was was pretty much a deep-fried veggie roll.For our entrees he ordered the sweet almond beef and I got the mussaman curry with chicken. Mine came in a large ceramic cauldron, a heady broth of coconut milk bobbing with potatoes and chunks of pineapple; I fished around with the serving spoon to locate the chicken I&#39;d ordered until we realized that it had been made with tofu.(Servers: this is what an ordering pad is for!! There is no shame in using one!!)I snared the waitress before she got into the back, and she took it away and apparently they remade the whole dish, because my friend finished his whole meal before mine came back. It ended up being okay, but in the end I should have tried something else initially (had I known).His dish was alright but as he said, only serviceable.There were a number of interesting sounding dishes on the menu (nutty chicken, coco chicken) and a plethora of seafood dishes (including the hilariously named (Hotty Seafood), but after this experience I&#39;ll return to the safety of Le Siam further south on 59."montri-thai-warrenville,Scott S.,LodifWEyEUgCn9bccuR4MA,"North Aurora, IL",1,1,0,3,18,PSSryucCT3gP_X1BMYQ_oA,2,06/05/12,"I was a fan of Ariya because of it&#39;s freshness and service.

I stuck to what I know best which is why I ordered Thai fried rice with chicken. The chicken was very flavorful and delicious! Definitely exceeded my expectations! Now the rice on the other hand didn&#39;t. I&#39;m not sure what ingredient they used too much of but the taste reminded me a lot of the $1 Michelina&#39;s boxed frozen fried rice which I do not like. Price for my order was about $10 and it was a good size portion if only I had liked the flavor more.

At least you guys should give some real Thai rice because it is famous and normal in Thai food; HOWEVER! The rice is so sticky and slagging I&#39;m sure it is the same rice like super cheap Asian fast food rice. Well, anyone who give 5 stars I hope you guys enjoy.

We also got the medallions medium rare. I am no where near a blood lover and I really prefer my steak not to moo. Howeverrrrrr Coopers got me like whoa and I&#39;m slowly going from well done, medium well, medium, to now medium rare all because of their steak. It&#39;s like hell has frozen over but I am a believer. It was perfectly juicy and not super under cooked. Very succulent and practically like butter.We had the cheesecake and some type of chocolate balls(ha) for dessert. Holy f! So flame so fire aka really frickin delicious.

Â That was happiness in a big glass. Â Also, the plum wine and the passion fruit wine was great! Â I know.. Plum right? I promise you, it - does - not taste like Plum.

Â We just had one slight hiccup when we first were checking in, but besides that everything was great.Came with a group on a Friday night and it was packed (be sure to make a reservation!!). Â They helped the waiting process by passing out samples of one of their wines by the door. Â It was definitely a warm welcome.So our little hiccup happened just at the beginning, we had a 6pm reservation and were waiting on some of our party still (20 minutes later), we were going to be a pretty big group they wouldn&#39;t let us sit until half of our party was there, and then when we were waiting, even though we had half of the party, they were a little antsy to seat us as they had an 8pm reservation for the big table. Â It worked out because the 8pm ended up canceling, but it&#39;s not cool to refuse to seat us when we could have at least gotten started with some appetizers, and then turn around and complain about us not being seated because our whole party wasn&#39;t there. Â OK RANT OVER.So the servers definitely made up for it, one was training, which may have accounted for the slightly slower service (again, why so slow if you were trying to get us out? Â OK RANT REALLY OVER THIS TIME). Â They have a pretty varied menu, and a quite a few different types of wines to choose from. Â They do wine flights and sangria flights (although it&#39;s not on the menu). Â Their wines are really good, and this is coming from someone who doesn&#39;t really like wine.The food is also exceptional, Crab Cake bites appetizer, Burrata Prosciutto &amp; Arugula bruschetta, Cooper&#39;s Hawk Calamari, get them all. Â They are all delicious. Â For the main dish I had Dana&#39;s Parmesan-crusted Chicken. Â Although the portion was pretty generous it was so delicious I ate the whole thing.We rolled out of there pretty satisfied. Â It&#39;s a great place with good wine and good food. Â If you&#39;re a wine-drinker, enjoy their food, and go there often enough, their wine club is also a great deal."coopers-hawk-winery-and-restaurants-burr-ridge-2,Katie S.,imHnMAPtXMw_NKQt8ZorXw,"Chicago, IL",1,1,1,52,109,Kpl6-rIx3ZM6VVi5lpZwhg,4,05/11/15,"Since I work in the neighborhood, Cooper&#39;s Hawk is pretty unavoidable. Â It&#39;s always the first suggestion for after work drinks and snacks and it&#39;s very apparent why that is.I have never had food here that I did not like. Â Granted, I&#39;m vegetarian, so I&#39;m very limited in what I can eat here because this is a restaurant (like so many) that like to put meat into everything. Â My favorite appetizer that I have eaten here is the Thai Lettuce Wraps. Â I will admit- I enjoy building my own food. Â So, I liked that they serve everything deconstructed and you can build your own wraps. Â But I thought that the sauce on those wraps was delicious. Â I could drink it, it was so good. Â I&#39;ve also enjoyed the Mediterranean Plate which is good. Â I also like some of their flat bread options- the roasted vegetable &amp; goat cheese is very good, as is the caprese.I really like the flatbread &amp; salad/ soup &amp; salad combinations. Â Last time that I came to Cooper&#39;s Hawk, I ordered the ceasar pesto &amp; lobster bisque and that combination was divine. Â The salad had so much flavor and the bisque was so creamy with just the right amount of lobster (aka not a whole lot). Â I think this will be my go-to dish from here on out.I also have many coworkers who do the wine club. Â I have a few of their wines. Â I like the sparkling almond wine, but I can only drink it on certain occasions because I do not like sweet wine all that much. Â I have had their Sauvignon Blanc which I very much enjoyed. Â I also really liked their cabernet. Â So, I feel like their wines hit all the bases (red, white, sweet).The staff have always been friendly. Â But if you can, make a reservation because this is a hot spot and it&#39;s hard to get in at certain times.

You can&#39;t go wrong if you order one of the following:- roasted vegetable goat cheese flatbread-chicken madeira-cilantro ranch chicken sandwich-bbq ranch chicken salad-blackened bleu steak salad (my personal fav! tangy vinaigrette balanced out with feta cheese and bleu cheese dressing)You really can&#39;t go wrong with any of their wines either. For a small price you can sample some wines as you wait for your table, or afterwards to pick out a bottle to bring home with you. As a wine club member, the one bottle a month membership is really worth the price (especially if you plan on sharing the membership with someone). I split it with my fiance and for $9 a month per person, you usually get a bottle that costs around $30 regularly.

Â We ordered all of the above and then ordered off-menu for our individual entrees.The menu is large and has meat entrees, burgers, sandwiches, seafood - something for every eater.

Here you can find a pretty good selection of wine, wine gifts and delicious food to cater to all palates.If you are inclined to have a bottle of wine at dinner and enjoy having a selection of reasonably priced wine at your home, the wine club is worth looking into. For a set price each month, you receive 1-2bottles of wine and depending on the package, free monthly wine tastings. You can take your accrued wine home with you or you can enjoy it while eating at the restaurant or bar without a corkage fee. If you are unlikely to visit monthly, it is still great. The bottles accumulate and you can pick them up anytime. That said, I have gone on a hiatus and picked up 8 bottles. I have a friend who used a year&#39;s worth of wine for her rehearsal dinner. You also incur points which equate to dollars you can spend when dining.Now that I am through raving about their wine club membership, I can tell you about the amazing menu options. I love their drunken shrimp, southern grilled shrimp and polenta and the bannoche pie.

We decided to try the tasting while we were there. I really enjoyed the wine tasting our host was this really nice girl by the name of Shelby. She already knew one of girlfriends because she signed her up to be a wine club member. However I was really impressed that she actually remembers her and you would have thought that they were really close friends. While we were tasting Shelby was telling me about the wine member benefits and I must say it really is worth it to be a member.When we used my friends member card she was able to get two free tastings and also get a deal on the chocolate covered strawberries we also order. We also were able to use her member card towards our bill which allowed us to have the price cut dramatically. Â At this location they had a pretty good selection of wine, wine gifts and delicious food to cater to all palates. We were seated as soon as our tasting was finished, Shelby had told them to add us to their list so we wouldn&#39;t have to wait which was perfect.For dinner I ordered the sweet red/ romance red bottle of wine at dinner. I ordered the SPINACH &amp; CHEESE CANNELLONI WITH SHRIMP which was a pasta. The pasta was really good. The portions are a really great size, my friend and I shared our pasta so that we both could if we liked it. I am not sure what pasta she had but that was also very good. We all were pleased with our food.Although they do not have a location in Dallas, When I come home to Chicago I plan to visit regularly going forward."coopers-hawk-winery-and-restaurants-burr-ridge-2,Vany L.,aRiVmnlUK3qWx37kWl9c7g,"Plainfield, IL",1,1,1,170,252,zn1In6S8PM7GCM4lv6qHvw,5,11/01/16,"Wine tasting!

In addition, I&#39;m considering not renewing my monthly wine membership. Is this an organization we really want to be a part of? Not so sure.

We came on really snowy/crappy day so it wasn&#39;t overly busy until we were leaving around 6:30-7pm. First we did the wine tasting and the guy doing our tasting (forgot his name) was so knowledgeable about each wine we were trying. We&#39;ve done several tastings at the Orland location, and they just fill up the glasses and move on to the next guest. This was a nice a touch! I also opted in for the Wine Club since we go to Cooper&#39;s Hawk so often.Our dinner was good, as expected. I got the Parmesan chicken, which is a spin on the more traditional style (no noodles, no heavy sauce), which I liked. My friend got the ahi tuna which is her go-to. We also ALWAYS get the cheese platter. Always, always. We love it, and we love the little sign that comes with it telling you about the cheeses you&#39;re eating. They ran out of the pepper jelly though and we weren&#39;t that big of a fan of the one they replaced it with.Our server was great! She knew we weren&#39;t in a rush to go back out and drive in the snowy / rain/ slush that had fallen upon us so she didn&#39;t pressure us to leave quickly at all.Of course the wine is awesome as always. I&#39;m a sweet wine drinker because I&#39;m not a big fan of traditional wine, and their cranberry, plum, raspberry, passion fruit, and cranberry mixed with sparkling almond wine are my absolute favorites.If you are a fan of wine, definitely try out Cooper&#39;s Hawk.

Â I&#39;m a big wine drinker, my husband doesn&#39;t drink at all, boo.We had a reservation for 7 and got there a little early. Â The tasting area was packed, maybe it felt more that way because it was a cramped space. Â We were seated at like 6:45. Â They send you a text message when your table is ready. Â I like that way better than those stupid vibrating light up buzzer things.I had been eyeballing the menu for three or four days prior to our arrival so I already knew what I was going to order: the gnocchi with roasted butternut squash. Â Oh and a white wine flight of course. Â No appetizers because I think only one was vegetarian and I&#39;m not a fan of lettuce wraps of any variety. Â Ew.There was a note on the little piece of paper they left on our table that it was our anniversary but we didn&#39;t get anything special like some others mentioned that they did. Â I didn&#39;t expect anything, but it&#39;s always fun when it happens.Husband ordered the churrasco grilled steak which he loved. Â He also raved about his parmesan fries. Â He didn&#39;t even ask for steak sauce or ketchup.As for the wine... the chardonnay was the best. Â It was all good but the one I cared for the least was the Cooper&#39;s Hawk White. Â It was almost too sweet for me. Â I had to put a couple ice cubes in it to kind of water it down. Â I drank it all though, of course. Â The glasses definitely held a generous amount. Â I&#39;ve had some flights before that had half of what I was given.We got dessert which was the banoffee pie or something like that. Â As the menu describes, it&#39;s graham cracker crust (they had me at that), bananas, toffee filling topped with whipped cream. Â That was goooooooood. Â We split it. Â I&#39;m not a huge dessert person in my aging ways, but an exception was made for this evening.And of course, I ended up signing up for the wine club. Â One bottle a month variety of white and red. Â I was a little tipsy from my wine flight so I sat there and stared at the brochure for like 20 minutes trying to read it, but not really comprehending what it said so I&#39;m not exactly sure how it works, but hopefully I figure it out soon. Â I assume I&#39;ll get an email or something to tell me to go pick up my bottle.I&#39;d like it even more if my husband would have a damn glass of wine with me but that isn&#39;t going to ever happen so I guess it&#39;ll be just me indulging in the fruits of their winemaking labor."coopers-hawk-winery-and-restaurants-burr-ridge-2,Nancy N.,ub7Ante8rFffJoxeE33Y3g,"Ellenwood, GA",0,1,0,89,9,PCw4nEoH7d1ahUUhho5Iyw,4,12/10/15,"I had the house salad, Â cheese tasting, drunken shrimp, and filet mignon along with the blueberry wine.

This was my first tasting ever (I&#39;m far from a wine connoisseur), so I wasn&#39;t exactly sure what to expect. Before going, I asked a friend, who previously lived in Napa, what to expect at a tasting. He told me that I would be able to just taste a few sips of wines or spit. However, this tasting had a lot more wine than I anticipated. You get eight &#34;tastings&#34; which are really glasses filled almost a third with wine. Wow! I selected the variety tasting, though all sweet wine was also an option. For someone who hasn&#39;t tried a lot of wine I like, I was impressed by how tasty some of the selections were. Due to the volume of wine, I recommend doing a tasting first, then settling into a long dinner if you&#39;re driving home. My only complaints were that the bar was pretty small, so I kept bumping into the guy next to me (there also weren&#39;t chairs). There were people waiting behind us to taste also. Although service was generally really friendly and competent (there were several people taking care of us), I wasn&#39;t a fan that one bartender tried to convince me to join the Wine Club multiple times throughout the tasting. Overall it was a fantastic experience, totally a steal for $7, and I will return!Next up was dinner. We are both vegetarians and there were plenty of options from which to choose. We both decided on the black bean burger to ensure we ate something substantial enough to soak up the wine. Service was cordial and efficient. We enjoyed a delicious pretzel bread and butter while waiting for our food. Luckily, the wait wasn&#39;t long at all. My black bean burger was very thick and big. The fries were great, too! Even though the entree was good, the pretzel bread was so delicious that I&#39;m still salivating over it now.I had a really positive experience here and I&#39;m definitely a fan.

Â The ambiance and concept of Cooper&#39;s Hawk is great...casual but nice at the same time, with good hearty food and numbered to easily pair with wines on the menu. Â I was traveling and staying nearby for 2 days and came both nights for dinner...and both nights were busy with waits for tables, but there was seats at the bar. Â So I sat down, and asked for a couple tastes...you would have thought I was asking the bartender to do something horribly awful, as he reluctantly poured me some offerings, without any suggestions at all. Â It was a bit unexpected, as most wine centric places tend to talk a lot about their wine offerings...I would think a winery that makes their own has even more to offer.The menu is lengthy and a bit overwhelming, with so many choices...bartender was no help at all with any suggestions...in fact, i had to flag him down to come take my order. Â I ordered a great pasta dish that had mushrooms, tomatoes and cream sauce. Â The second night, I had an appetizer order of seared tuna tacos that hit the spot. Â I tried the banana bread ice cream sandwich for dessert, which was so decadent, sweet and delicious. Â I would have stayed longer to try out more wines and watch 2 Boston (Red Sox &amp; Patriots) sports games that played on consecutive nights on the bar area TVs, but I seriously felt like the bartender was giving me the evil eye despite the bar area not being busy, so I paid and left.On my way out during the second visit, I stopped in the retail portion of the winery/restaurant and wanted to buy a couple of truffles. Â I bought 2 and then asked a question from the girl behind the counter regarding one of the truffles&#39; ingredients, and she said, &#34;yeah, I&#39;m not sure&#34; and walked away to help another customer.

These were small bites that had big flavor of rare blackened tuna with cilantro, sriracha and avocado in a crispy shell. It was so good. Â I ordered a side of the Asian slaw as well and was very disappointed. Â It usually is creamy and flavorful. Unfortunately, the creamy dressing was nowhere to be found. The slaw was extremely dry and not enjoyable. Â Thankfully, I had wasabi cream served with my tacos and used that to give some moisture to the slaw. Lastly, my cappuccino that I ordered at the end of my meal was served lukewarm at best. Another disappointment. There is no reason it shouldn&#39;t be piping hot with steamed foam and hot espresso. It must have sat for awhile before being served to me. Even with the mishaps, I do recommend this place for the food and wine. They have a wonderful menu.

But that doesn&#39;t excuse it happening, and happening EVERY TIME we pick up food from here.It seems as if there are so many people doing so many different jobs that orders get lost in translation.

One time we waited so long and they gave us a slice of chocolate cake. That was nice, but something we ordered was STILL wrong. I would rather wait a long time and have the order right than have them hurry to get the order done and mess it up.That being said. I will never stop eating here because the food is so good.

Also, if you are planning to get a drink, get a regular size one instead of a large because a regular size drink at Portillo is basically a large compared to other fast food joints.My friends kept telling me how Portillo has the best chopped salad ever and I always wanted to try it.

What other way should one get it. For those of you watching your figures there is a salad option where they make your salad in front of you at a separate side counter. The dog was great as I devoured the whole Chicago dog. I want to scold some people as I saw someone picking the tomatoes and sports peppers off their dog. What is this world coming to?

The question is, do you consider it as your home? Or do you have to go to the next town for your home?I don&#39;t think this makes sense to you so let me explain this. You know how every home is different right? Some homes are just totally messed up. Some homes pretend to be perfect. The rest? Well, they admit that they aren&#39;t perfect, but they make it work. This home makes you feel like removing your bra or pants or both (not literally though) at the door step because you want to be comfortable. This place makes you comfortable gorging down huge bites of food and nobody will judge you (ok maybe your conservative grandma who tells you that you need to be modest or you will never find a husband). This is what this Portillo&#39;s feels like. It feels like home.I have to drive a good 10-15 minutes to get here because I don&#39;t think I should pay tolls when I&#39;m already starving. Ambiance is great especially when we come in a few hours before closing time. It&#39;s quiet and we always get a coveted booth without fighting like The Game of Thrones.My favorite is obviously the FAMOUS ITALIAN BEEF. However, I do not like drowning it in all it&#39;s juicy goodness. I prefer my sandwich dry with hot peppers a side of gravy. Dipped sandwich just makes the bread soggy and lose it&#39;s crunch. I also order their freshly fried fries (say this 10 time faster) with a side of their hot cheddar which makes everything taste better. They also have this chocolate cake shake with, you guessed it, chocolate shake and ground up chocolate cake. I think this is too thick to suck through a tiny straw so your other option would be to scoop it out with a spoon (or fork since they seem to have gotten rid of their spoons). I always want to order this with my meal but my conscience tells me no so I end up getting a lemonade instead.Overall, I always leave happy and stuffed after a night out in Portillo&#39;s. It&#39;s pretty cheap and satisfying. What more could you ask for?PS. Portillo&#39;s staff who manage their Yelp reviews: Could you please change the battery of the paper towel dispenser in the women&#39;s bathroom? I always end up waiting for a minute or two before I get another paper towel which is frustrating due to the fact that I really just want to eat my food before it turns cold.

It is chopped romaine and iceberg lettuce mixed with Ditalini pasta, chicken breast, bacon, tomato, red cabbage, Gorgonzola cheese, green onion and house dressing. I add a little balsamic vinegar to kick it up a notch. The hot dog is served on a poppy seed bun (not my favorite). I always end up rubbing the bun to take off as many of the seeds as I can. It comes with a pickle but I take it off and it is still good with the remaining ingredients ( mustard, relish, chopped onions, tomato slices and sport peppers). The portions here are plentiful and even enough to share.All areas are clean, multiple cashiers to minimize long lines and a drive thru too.

It&#39;s normal, and it&#39;s ok. Take a deep breath and take it all in.Luckily, the menu items are so ridiculously reasonably priced that you can afford to be a bit indecisive and order, say, a massive salad, a chicken sandwich, a hotdog, and a milkshake (although I certainly don&#39;t recommend eating all that at once).Truth be told, I feel like the food quality is really on par with a 3-star rating, but the kitschy, retro Chicago decor, super friendly staff, and fast food service bump up the overall rating.The salads are awesome and HUGE. Word to the wise, though: get the dressing on the side. They kind of drench it with the dressing. The BBQ chicken and chopped salads are both amazing options.Sandwiches are just OK. The buns are a little wimpy, and there really isn&#39;t anything special about the sandwich itself. I&#39;m not a hot dog lover, per se, but that is what I&#39;d recommend over the chicken sandwich. My brother is quite partial to the combo beef and char-grilled sausage sandwich (it is MASSIVE).Fries and onion rings are solid side choices (fries are super salty, though). And of course, no trip would be complete without a SHAKE. Portions are huge (my sister and I split a large and could barely get through half of it) and if you are feeling truly decadent (or if you need a gain a few pounds in a hurry and/or up your blood sugar level pronto), order the chocolate cake shake.

Upon my first bite, my taste buds were crying out that this was arguably the best roast beef sandwich to pass beyond my teeth.Portillo&#39;s does so much business (both locations I visited) that they need additional employees walking the waiting lines to take pre-orders before the orders.If you dine in, they have multiple queues.If you order drive-through, they also have multiple queues.Regardless of which location you visit, the italian beef &#34;hot dog&#34; is consistent in its wet beefy flavor. Â (So wet that the inner bun gets soggy, but that&#39;s the great charm). No way could the chefs have ever pulled this off with sandwich bread, which would have to fall apart. Even naked (without peppers or other toppings) the hot dog is incredible.Not to mention portion size was excellent. A single hot dog fed 2 people.Onion rings were also excellent. The larger location&#39;s rings had a slightly better batter due to having a more crumbly and consistent texture. Nevertheless both locations produced excellent rings which were crunchy and cooked well enough that you didn&#39;t end-up pulling-out the onion by accident."portillos-hot-dogs-downers-grove,Guilherme G.,_rvxykxj_yGsB_Mt9ugAUw,"Atlanta, GA",1,1,1,30,67,3XLBa_NOA7qY2qNYb5ufWg,4,30/04/15,"Great place.

This one is no different.The one thing I think Portillo&#39;s has that isn&#39;t affirmed enough is the ambiance: every Portillo&#39;s I&#39;ve been to is decorated cleverly so you&#39;re transported out of the 21st century into the rustic American midwest, where the greasy Italian beef sandwich was (and still is) eaten alongside ragtime and big band music and checkered table cloths. Combined with the fact that all the ordering is done at the cash register, Portillo&#39;s is perfect for large or small groups who want a casual lunch/dinner, don&#39;t want to deal with waiters, and want to leave with their soul satisfied even though their arteries may not be (unless you get their salads, which are all tasty by the way.)In sum, Portillo&#39;s is always one of the first fast food places I turn to when I&#39;m in the mood for Chicago styled food, and this location was no different.***Also, dear tourists, the ketchup station is not for your hotdog. It is proper etiquette to the cooks to NOT slather your hot dog with sugar saturated, preservative infused tomato paste. That&#39;s for the fries."portillos-hot-dogs-downers-grove,Debbie O.,yTf-DyJ_S-5kin2GClCdUw,"St Charles, MO",0,1,1,11,133,CN3NWS5BnnzSDFlVJ7nMxw,5,08/07/15,Crazy but awesome!

I had an Italian Beef with Extra Gravy and sweet peppers ($4.75. not sure on extra charge for peppers) and Onion Rings ($1.99).I&#39;d asked for the Extra Gravy on the side, but the sandwiches weren&#39;t marked and the one I was handed was already doused (yelp.com/biz_photos/3hdkâ€_). I thought it was a good amount of thinly sliced, tender beef for the price (yelp.com/biz_photos/3hdkâ€_). The gravy definitely added to the overall flavor, but makes this a pretty messy thing to eat. Get extra napkins!The onion rings were under seasoned and seemed like average food service grade. Same with the crinkle cut fries I tried.Pretty good prices compared to what I see back in California. The Hot Dog, with all the standard Chicago style fixings, is $2.39 and a Maxwell St Polish is $3.59."portillos-hot-dogs-downers-grove,Marty B.,sqPIKv4sOE8fdz16GGC4AA,"Toledo, OH",0,1,1,24,37,CDuOq57myOIZi5_Dv6Izlw,4,18/05/15,"In Chicagoland for a training class for work.

Actually going from car to car to speed up service. I walked in. I ordered the beef and a chicago dog to go. Had to have the dog. I love those things. I have had them all over the country, but they never seem to taste the same. They look the same, have the same ingredients, and have even been made by Chicago ex-pats; they just never seem to taste exactly right.I received my order in under three minutes. Got back to my hotel and the food was still hot. The dog was awesome! Just what I needed and only $2.75. The beef? Meh. I expected a little more unique flavor than basically what I have experienced with almost every French Dip sandwich I&#39;ve ever eaten. The beef was finely shaved roast beef with a mild au jus. I expected some Italian seasoning of some kind. Also, I may have had the wrong idea about what sweet peppers meant. I was expecting the sweet cherry peppers common in Italian sandwich shops. What I got were three big wedges of green bell pepper that were steamed or slow sauteed. That sandwich I could take or leave. If I go back, I will have to see if they have Gardinera to put on the sammie.Obviously though, they are doing well.

I&#39;ve observed that quality control has severely dropped off in the past seven or eight years. The way hot dogs, burgers, polishes and other items are made seem haphazard, you can get a dry patty burger or a juicy one. You can get a hot dog with waaay too much mustard and relish to a point that it&#39;s mushy or one made properly. Their consistency has been all over the place in the past few years. Back in the day Portilo&#39;s was the consistent four or five star fast food eatery that earned it the reputation it seems to still have among most Chicagoans, but the days of that consistency are long gone.Now, on to the incident at hand. It&#39;s a Saturday evening and a decision was made to pick up two drive thru items at Portillo&#39;s being nearby, a Maxwell street Polish, and a grilled chicken croissant. The maxwell street polish appeared to be fine. However, the grilled chicken croissant (which is what I was having) was a different story. I pulled the Styrofoam container out and noticed something was below it in the bag, figuring it was probably just napkins or something I didn&#39;t investigate further. The lid on the container was tucked shut and I opened it up, took a bite and noticed that I had a croissant with only mayo and lettuce on the inside, no chicken. Upon further investigation into the bag I discovered the grilled chicken patty was just placed at the bottom of the bag, outside of not just the sandwich, but the container of the sandwich.Seriously Portillos&#39;? This is really the cherry on the sundae of crappy food I&#39;ve seen from Portillo&#39;s in the past few years. This puts the poor in Portillo&#39;s (that phrase works better if you say it aloud). While I may update this at a later point, I&#39;m giving the Downers Grove Portillo&#39;s only one star.

My family and I have been coming here for lunch since they opened, and each time we have come the service is always extremely slow. You wouldn&#39;t think that based on the amount of staff they have working all day, but it&#39;s true. When meals should take approximately 10 or so minutes to arrive at your table, they take closer to 20 or minutes. For a casual dining place, that is way too long. And if you&#39;re expecting refills on your drink, forget about it. You&#39;ll get your drink 10 min after you sit down and a server won&#39;t be back well after you&#39;re done eating.

Standard Market Grill had the best ratings and all the positive reviews and pictures looked promising. Located next to the Standard Market, the grill is its restaurant offering fresh fare. I was expecting a full service restaurant and was surprised to see an ordering counter as soon as you walk in. There&#39;s a digital menu beyond the counter and to be honest, I was looking for more variety in brunch options. If I didn&#39;t want a sandwich or salad, it seemed my options were limited to one of two omelets, a breakfast burrito, or a Belgian waffle. I quickly decided on a hanger steak and mushroom omelet, which is exactly what it sounds like and is served with standard breakfast potatoes (diced potatoes mixed with onions and peppers) or fresh fruit. Choice of white bread, whole grain bread, or English muffin. Strawberry jam and butter on the side. We were given a buzzer, told to grab our waters from their water station, and find our seats.Now is time to note that I like the layout of the restaurant. There&#39;s an indoor dining area; a semi-outdoor dining area with views of the pond, high windows and a cozy fireplace, and an outdoor dining area with wooden chairs and large umbrellas. There&#39;s a sign in the center table directing you to place your buzzer there and we did as instructed. Shortly thereafter, a server appeared, grabbed our buzzer from us, and assured us our food would be out soon. We waited only a short time and our food arrived.My omelet was fluffy and well-seasoned, with bits of hanger steak and mushroom through the egg instead of inside the omelet itself. I&#39;m not a huge meat person, but I think they could have definitely been more generous with the steak, especially at $9 for the omelet. Perhaps there was even an adequate amount of meat in my omelet and I just couldn&#39;t tell because it was chopped up and mixed with the egg and mushroom. The potatoes were heavily seasoned, and the onions and peppers gave it more flavor. The English muffin was also delicious, and I appreciated the fresh butter and strawberry jam.After delivering our food, our server did not come back to check on us and didn&#39;t seem to be anywhere near the patio area, which makes me very confused on what level of service Standard Market Grill is trying to achieve. I do not mind ordering at the counter or picking up my own drink, but then I would expect a classy place like this would offer more service than a greeting and food delivery. Overall the food is good; I&#39;m not impressed with the brunch selections but I look forward to coming back and giving lunch or dinner a shot."standard-market-grill-naperville,Sum L.,yy9Juak1e7oOOpzeUB4ReQ,"Chicago, IL",1,1,0,0,314,iA6_O5vterw1zULjWiT5bw,3,25/01/16,"Went there to try but not planning on having a second visit!I cant believe a weekend lunch having a burger, a salad, a small side and a drink for two ppl can cost 40+ bucks lolThe place look great, well maintained...even have a person to deliver food to your table...not sure if its a diner or fast food restaurant?!"standard-market-grill-naperville,Zorin D.,olX4sE4jb2wfxIkqzF1xjw,"Chicago, IL",1,1,1,118,101,xU2NirGdsOi6gClKmgw0AA,2,30/09/15,"I had passed by this place quite a bit and decidied to finally stop in and try it.

Â The one thing I will have to comment on is that they are a little slow to clear down tables, as one was left dirty for quite sometime into the meal.

I ended up getting the BLAT. Â It had tons of crisp bacon, nice toasted brioche bread and creamy avocado.

Got the Buddha bowl and no ginger peanut sauce...instead they gave me a yellow mustard- mayo sauce X 2. Hangar steak salad for $14 was literally like an appetizer and sadly not great.

Sure, the grocery store is nice as well, but the restaurant really takes the cake. The grocery store prices have niche items, so if I needed a specific ingredient and couldn&#39;t find it at a specialty store closer to me, I could probably look here. But, kind of out of my budget right now. The restaurant fits nicely within our budget, though. They have cucumber water and watermelon water, so that&#39;s free also.My husband ordered a chicken sandwich with chicken, cheese, and bacon. He orders a sandwich no other way. He liked it. He also had a bowl of chicken tortilla soup. He said it was good, but it was literally just chicken and tortilla chips. Usually there is some corn, tomatoes, beans, etc. in the soup, but not in this one. It was more of a chicken chili. Also, it came with tortilla chips on top..and a dinner roll...and packaged oyster crackers..so carb heaven.I ordered the veggie burger and I can confirm that it is not just a Morningstar or Boca burger patty. I asked and they do make them daily. Granted, I&#39;m sure that&#39;s a given, but it seems like most restaurants just use frozen patties. Anyway, it was delicious and I would order it again. Maybe without the BBQ sauce (I&#39;m just not a super BBQ fan). I did like the buttermilk garlic, though.And the fries...oh. the fries. Delicious. Freshly made and really, really good. If you&#39;re trying to be healthy and order a salad, good for you. The fries are worth it.Only downside is the seating. There needs to be a wall separating the ordering line from the booths. Otherwise, we had people watching us the entire time we ate. And maybe a better system for seating people. There were people walking in and saving tables so that by the time we ordered, there was only one table open.This is definitely a place to which we will return."standard-market-grill-naperville,Sung Y.,tKKyYFL2geQBTOJCZuD-ow,"Bloomingdale, IL",1,1,1,15,51,ENH6DAjGxiRyZFCMLeuwXQ,5,13/06/15,"I love this place!

The grocery store alone is tremendous, but my lunch at the Grill took me over the top. We had the grass fed burger with white cheddar cheese, tomato bacon jam, kale slaw, and red onion on a pretzel roll. I ordered it medium and it came out light pink in the middle and juicy. The jam was quite strong, but I liked how the raw onion cut the flavor. And you can&#39;t go wrong with a pretzel roll.I also had the mustard honey chicken sandwich. Pretzel batard, grilled chicken, Monterey Jack cheese, roasted red pepper, bacon, avocado, Bibb lettuce, red onion, mustard-honey. Everything just came together perfectly. I&#39;d order it again for sure.And the sides are great. The market side salad as these soft cornbread croutons. There is no crouton anywhere near as good as these. And it&#39;s true, get the sweet potato fries. Incredibly thick, nicely seasoned, and a good honey-mustard dipping sauce. I want some chicken fingers for that mustard!!!The Arnold Pomer was a really good drink; it&#39;s basically an Arnold Palmer with pomegranate juice. Very refreshing and refills are free. And there are no salt and pepper shakers. They give you a grinder that has coarse salt on one end and peppercorns on the other. You grind either side, so both the salt and pepper are as fresh as can be. Awesome. And the service was really good, everybody was very friendly.For a casual place, the ingredients are top notch and the menu is unique and creative while being approachable.

Check out my seperate review for the grocery portion.Came here for lunch. It is the type of place where you order at the register but then have a server from there on out. Brock and I split the mushroom/goat cheese pizza (AHH goat cheese!!) and the blue cheese steak sandwich. We were lucky enough to find a seat on the patio where we waited with our pager-thingy. The neat thing is that the pager has a gps of some sort so your server can tell where you sit and bring your food to you. We even moved seats once and he figured it out!Our food was brought quickly and was delish! The pizza was larger than I expected, definitley sharing size, and the sandwich was average size. The pizza was a kind-of cross between a flatbread and a regular pizza, kind of rustic, with perfect crust. The steak sandwich was cooked well, rare, and was of average tenderness. It still got stuck in between your teeth as rare steak typically does. The star of the sandwich though was the blue cheese aioli. It was not too pungent but you certainly knew it was there. I am not a HUGE blue cheese fan but this was balanced perfectly. The sandwich was paired with fries which were average if you ask me, I don&#39;t know what other Yelpers are raving about there.The service was excellent as was the value. Our freshly squeezed lemonade even came with refills which NEVER EVER happens. Our server was attentive but not overbearing and came with warm chocolate chip cookie chunks to accompany our check.The patio is small so the seating is a little tight but I love eating outdoors. I&#39;ll be returning if i&#39;m in the neighborhood."standard-market-grill-naperville,Brent M.,GXH5bVSXlmPoj1RdSK2-XA,"Naperville, IL",0,1,0,22,95,jQwWsK4Xzoi7XjG26llvIA,5,25/07/15,"This is our &#34;go to&#34; default restaurant for our date nights, and it doesn&#39;t disappoint.It is a really casual, chill, and warm atmosphere that serves GREAT food. The service is good. No memorable, but good. Especially since the menu options are on display on the wall and over the cash register. That&#39;s what makes it more casual than it could be, but if it is attached to a grocery store in the &#39;burbs, what would you expect? No Maitre D&#39; in this place, and that&#39;s OK.Starting with the appetizers, I always order the chicken tortilla soup. It is VERY heart, full of generous pulled chicken pieces. It has a &#39;bite&#39; to it, like they added a spice that doesn&#39;t make it burn on the way down, but defintely reminds you of it&#39;s heat potential with a spicy aftertaste.MMMMM....Each time I indent to oder a cup, I default to the bowl size and end of waxing it off. Minus the tortilla strips added to the meal, it&#39;s one of the healthier meal choices you can make in this place, especially if you are among for a gluten-free meal. Here is the bonus: If you don&#39;t finish your soup and take some home in a doggy bag, Day old soup is the BEST!Order the sweet potato fries over the regular fries...You can&#39;t get good fried at many restaurants in the area, but a generous portion of well seasoned sweet potato fries are far and few between. One side of this is too much for one person - definitely sharing size.The kale slaw is an interesting version of their original cole slaw. I enjoyed both. When I am nutrient-conscious, I&#39;ll order the kale. It&#39;s a bit tangier. When I don&#39;t give to farts on what goes into my body, and I want a calorie rich meal, enter the coleslaw...it is very tasty.Believe it or not, you can make a complete meal with the appetizers alone. That&#39;s how a control my portion size and $ when dining.The grass-fed burger is really good. It&#39;s well cooked and worth paying the premium for a burger in this establishment. I&#39;ll put it on the same level as Ted&#39;s Montana restaurant. Thats says a lot about the quality of the food. Trust me...I am a man who &#39;knows his meat&#39;.....wait, that didn&#39;t sound right....The asian chicken salad is HUGE and tasty. Huge and crappy is never good. Huge and memorable - always better. They don&#39;t drench the salad in dressing, which is what i personally prefer. The portion size is a full entree itself, and maybe shareable (depends who you are with, I guess).Being on/off on a paleo diet, this restaurant is paleo friendly.

The girl behind the counter said she could make me a new one but it would take a few minutes to make the chia. We were in a hurry so I had to get the receipt to make the return.

Now when I walked into this fine establishment on this fine day and observed the fine menu board rich with options, I was blinded by my previous experience. I ordered the Brunch Burger, a delicacy by my standards, and my amigo ordered the Brisket Grilled Cheese. I had been resting in the booth with my good friend when after an extended period of time my friend had his meal and I was still waiting for my glorious sandwich. I had to go say something to the server and finally I had the beloved burger in front me. Considering the quality of food served here, I had high hopes that have never been disappointed before. You would think frying an egg is a simple task, but it seems the chefs that day had it out for my immune system (as in salmonella, which is rampant uncooked eggs). As for my friends brisket grilled cheese, it was less than satisfactory. He considers himself a connoisseur of brisket having eaten and enjoyed it for many years (he&#39;s pretty old but that&#39;s just between you and me). As I enjoyed my bacon and burger (minus the egg) I periodically looked over at him taking large slices of fat off of his grilled cheese. While I am no professor of brisket according to him this is one of the worst sins possible in meats. Over half of the brisket were large pieces of fat. With the combination of the poor service, and the lackluster elements of the food, Standard Market Grill was not up to standard"standard-market-grill-naperville,Kara C.,plMXnC0LOnkUS_HK6R_4Jw,"Naperville, IL",0,1,0,0,162,IRvWal90W5UI4YkaqcrM-Q,3,24/07/15,"This restaurant is great.

Â My husband and I always pass this place on our bike ride along the fox river and have been wanting to try it so we finally had the chance. Â I don&#39;t know what the inside looks like since we walked straight onto the deck and were seated. Â The deck was nice and I thought we were going to have an enjoyable breakfast... I was wrong!It all started when I asked for a tomato juice with a lemon and was served a glass of tomato juice that tasted like a tin can and a lemon that looked like it was sitting on the counter for two days (dry and old). Â It was 10am so it was an old, old lemon slice not sliced that morning for certain. Â  I told the waitress the juice did not taste right and instead of asking if I wanted something else I was told she just opened the can and it was fresh, and that it is fine. Â  Needless to say I said I would be fine with water.When I went to order I asked if the bacon was made fresh and was told &#34;that all the people love their bacon&#34; Â I asked again if it was made fresh or if it was bought premade and just heated and was told &#34;yes&#34;. Â I skipped the bacon and just asked for two eggs, hash browns, and toast.As my breakfast was served I took one bite of my hash browns and when I went for a second bite a short black hair was in the hash browns. Â I put it to the side and planned to skip the hash browns and just eat the eggs and toast. Â I wasn&#39;t going to say anything given I had just complained about the juice and lemon and didn&#39;t want to be difficult. BUT As I cut into the eggs and placed it on my fork the egg turned upside down and on the backside of the egg was two more short black hairs. Â At this time I had enough and brought it to the wait staffs attention. Â I was met with an argumentative response with her telling me they were not hair that they were potato&#39;s. Â I told her I know what hair looks like andI also cook and know what a potato looks like. Â She insisted that they were not hairs and that the cook wears a hair net! Â It was crazy! Â  She then backed off her explanation that they were potato&#39;s but still insisted they weren&#39;t hairs. Â I told her since she can&#39;t tell me what they are, and they are not food, I don&#39;t want the entree. Â After many times of her telling me they weren&#39;t hairs she asked if I wanted another order. Â I told her I would not.My husband was afraid to eat his dish but didn&#39;t want to cause more issues so ate. Â He said his dish was not a good dish to judge the place on because it was a healthy egg beaters breakfast sandwich was very tasteless and dry but he attributes that to it being healthy.I would never go back!"urban-counter-saint-charles,Shevon R.,S2xVq_56n25pP0IhjQwMYQ,"Elburn, IL",0,1,0,45,141,FYJeNsblj9zWfC0nEV30xw,4,26/08/16,"Happy with this location too!

Excellent customer service and my food was delicious. I stopped in after collecting coupon after coupon from the Cougars games. This location just recently opened up and it&#39;s the nearest to me. I got gas at the gas station, checked out the liquor store and then bought my lunch.The menu has apps, sides, wings,burgers, sandwiches and salads. My coupon was buy a main and make it a meal for free. After much thought taking in the menu, I settled on the BLT. It has avocado on it, which caught my eye. I got it on wheat bread, which they toasted just right and plenty of fresh lettuce and tomato plus a gentle amount of mayo, the avocado and the main star of the sandwich, the bacon! It was perfectly done, just thick enough and in between crispy and chewy. The sandwich was top notch. I chose tater tots as my side, who doesn&#39;t love tater tots!?!?!? These were crunchy and potatoey. Yum! Finally, I got a diet coke. It rivals McDonald&#39;s quality. It came from a small version of those computerized soda machines, and it had the exact amount of carbonation needed for a quality pop.I loved my experience.

The reviews of the Aurora location impressed me and once I saw a positive review posted for this location, I decided to give Urban Counter a try.It is located right next to the BP gas station at Bricher &amp; IL Route 38. I&#39;m sure at some point I will combine feeding me and feeding my car into one trip.I&#39;m a simple basic kind of guy and I like the style of this place. Not fancy or pretentious. Functional sort of industrial-looking furniture. Could see the grill from the counter. I made a take-out order, and it took maybe 5-6 minutes from placing my order to it being ready. I didn&#39;t time it. Yes, it took longer than McDonald&#39;s/BK/Wendy&#39;s, but I got a better product that was made-to-order and wasn&#39;t thrown together. Worth the wait.For my first visit, I went with the Bacon Burger and a regular-sized order of fries. The burger was very good. The thick half-pound patty comes with bacon, barbecue sauce, onion rings, cheddar, and roasted jalapenos. As I was eating it, I had forgotten about the jalapenos and was wondering where the spicy kick came from. They were a nice touch. Better than the raw pickled jalapenos you might get on a burger elsewhere. Sauce was good, onion rings were good. The bacon didn&#39;t overwhelm the burger. The flavors were balanced. The burger was well-constructed. I was worried such a big burger might fall apart and be a mess to eat, but it all stayed together right down to the last bite.There were two things I liked about the hand-cut fries. They were lightly salted with a larger-grained salt. So many places oversalt their fries so badly that my tongue feels assaulted. Not with these fries. They were a nice change. I also liked that the fries weren&#39;t limp and greasy. One Italian beef place I used to go to sells hand-cut fries that are so greasy and go totally limp if you don&#39;t eat them in 5 minutes. Urban Counter&#39;s fries were still nice and crispy after a 10-minute car ride.I&#39;ve been wanting a place where I can grab a good burger for lunch that&#39;s a step up from the usual fast food places, offers good value, and has the kind of ambiance/convenience I like. I think Urban Counter is it, and I look forward to trying the rest of the menu."urban-counter-saint-charles,Megan K.,JkQdBr0iIgIhikT0kOTkPQ,"Wayne, IL",0,1,0,0,13,y1VqT2XrKsnc3oXvFn03yQ,4,27/08/16,"We have eaten at the other locations and this one is just as good.

The behind the counter could use some help. The sweet potato fries are mushy ( like the Fryer fat wasn&#39;t hot enough) and some were so dried out that they seemed burned. The Choc shake was like wipped milk with chocolate, not creamy thick.Not sure why the cup for the milkshake said &#34; Pride&#34; on it. Are they owned by the Pride wine store next door or did they just run out of plastic cups? The people at the register seem tired and the people at the grill frustrated. The burgers are good.The biggest problem is that they close at 7pm on Friday and Saturday nights! When we were there Saturday 3 people walked in a couple minutes after 7 because no one locked the door, and they told them sorry they were closed!

Egg Harbor feeds this addiction more than I like to admit, especially with a toddler and infant now in tow. A family friendly atmosphere with quick service and an expansive menu makes everyone happy! It does get busy on the weekends but the waits goes quickly and certainly isn&#39;t bad when you can wait in beautiful weather outside.The usual breakfast items are available as well as amped up versions depending on your mood. Plain whole wheat pancakes, blueberry, pumpkin, Boston cream?!? Each season brings new delights!My personal favorites include the Sir Dugan Frittata, you can&#39;t go wrong with bacon and eggs, or Cassie&#39;s Crepes, an enticing crepe bursting with fresh avocado, mushrooms, egg, and cheese served with creamy poppyseed dressing- amazing!The kids menu is also expansive. Our little guy loves the pancakes, waffles, and sausage. It also come with a drink. The coloring sheets and children&#39;s books make the short wait for food even more manageable.Be sure to check the specials board when you walk in or ask your server.

The turkey options were actually well seasoned and delicious as well.I started with the flavored coffee - cinnamon hazelnut. Wow. Yum.I had the cheese grits with eggs. Eggs were cooked perfectly. Grits cooked well - LOTS of cheese on top and the other toppings, jalapeÃ±os, turkey bacon, onions - so flavorful.My husband had the oatmeal with berries - again, great texture.This place is really great for brunch.

Our server was extremely pleasant and welcoming, and very attentive throughout our breakfast.We sat outside in the patio seating early on a Sunday morning. The sunny morning helped, but it&#39;s a beautiful place to sit and enjoy breakfast. I also really like how they leave a sizable pitcher of water (with a lid, of course!) out on the table. This gave us more than enough water to drink throughout the meal and lessened the need for staff to come out and refill anything.The reason it would be 4.5 and not 5 for me is because the least exciting part of my visit was the food. I ordered a meaty skillet, but the taste of the skillet was rather dry and overwhelmed by the onions cooked with the meat. I think the onions are a necessary part of the dish, but I was hoping for the egg and meat to dominate the flavor. I will try different items on return visits, hoping to find a go-to dish. The English muffin served with the skillet was very good.My girlfriend was pleased with her order of the special French toast, and said her coffee was also delicious.Overall, the service is absolutely top notch, and the ambience is great.

The service was awful. We were there on a busy day, Veteran&#39;s Day, but it wasn&#39;t packed. There was a very short wait. Main thing is that not all items I ordered made it to the table and what I ordered as an appetizer was not brought out until my entire meal was ready and served. We had two different waitresses. It was annoying. If ever at this mall again I will eat here because they offer gluten free options, but that is about the only reason I will continue to go. Salad was wilted.

Then, she returned a few moments later, taking our orders for food.We had spent a very stressful morning waiting for my son to get out of surgery, so once he was in his room resting somewhat comfortably, we left his bedside and chose to dine at Egg Harbor Cafe.Four of us in our party were very pleased with what was served. The drinks were refilled continuously, and cold beverages got little carafes left on our table.All of us enjoyed what we ordered to eat, but the customer service really blew us away with how they were involved with our dining experience. Not only did the manager make several appearances, but Caroline, our server, was top-notch!

The tables are small for the number of people and amount of food crammed onto them. I wouldn&#39;t call the seating comfortable.So why go here? Well sometimes you want a breakfast that really should be classified as dessert. Or sometimes you want a breakfast made up of the five major food groups: meat, meat, meat, eggs, and cheese. Or sometimes you&#39;re like me and you want Cassie&#39;s Crepes; a strange but delicious combo of crepes filled with scrambled eggs, avocado, mushrooms, cheese &amp; topped with poppyseed dressing. Most people seem to find something here they like. Most of my friends and family can agree on Egg Harbor when they can&#39;t agree on other places to eat. And, this is big, the coffee is decent ... and it keeps coming.If it were dinnertime I&#39;d hate a place like this, but despite the clatter, chatter, and crowding this place works for me for breakfast out. It&#39;s a solid choice. We especially like to meet friends here after visiting the Farmers Market on summer Saturday mornings."egg-harbor-cafÃ©-downers-grove-2,Bill M.,OlhH_-yyVWU6jj8H2TMSiQ,"Chicago, IL",1,1,0,1709,72,Tk29eS1yKJ2SqRBRr0pPgw,3,30/12/12,"I was corralled by my bosses to this goofy diner with the kitschy but smile-inducing decor of roosters and chickens everywhere.

It was just about as perfect as could be. We also tried the veggie skillet and the Mexican omelette. The over easy eggs were overdone but it wasn&#39;t for me so why am i complaining. The only other things that I could see that were keeping it from getting another star is that the portions weren&#39;t the usual huge - i need to take half of this home - portions im used to.Apart from being only a tad more expensive than the usual diner price for me and the portions - especially the potatoes - it was a good solid breakfast place with a huge menu that could accommodate anyone&#39;s cravings and breakfast/brunch/lunch needs.egg-harbor-cafÃ©-downers-grove-2,Rosalie L.,miGqxTmQI9zJ1o1x8e75eQ,"Naperville, IL",0,1,0,11,15,2FgEvdbKmXHWHQGmN33Sug,3,04/04/10,"Located just south of the Metra station, Egg Harbor is the perfect breakfast spot for commuters who don&#39;t want to skip the most important meal of the day.

Â You wanted to love someplace, but you walked out disappointed. Â Well, now it&#39;s my turn.I wanted to love JT&#39;s Porch, because a friend of mine raved about their wings. Â Five of us met up here on a Monday night, for their 50 cent wings, and while it was busy it wasn&#39;t overcrowded or too loud. Â I don&#39;t like traditional wings, so I ordered the boneless (not included in the 50 cent special). Â They are definitely big, but I didn&#39;t particularly like either sauce I tried. Â I tried the Buffalo and Spicy Garlic, and there wasn&#39;t much differentiation between the two. Â Neither sauce was anything greater than ordinary. Â The cheese curds were just okay.The beer list is decent, there is a variety of draft beer and bottles to make everyone happy. Â There&#39;s also a full bar for cocktails, and on Monday night there was some kind of $4 cocktail special.We sat down immediately, but it took our waitress awhile to acknowledge us and take drink orders. Â The service that night, overall, was bad. Â She forgot our drinks, and our food took forever to arrive at the table. Â When we got our food, everything (appetizers and all) came at once, and one of the orders was wrong. Â At the end of the night, she gave us our checks and said, &#34;you might want to check those. Â They could be wrong. Â But they should be right.&#34; Â Ugh. Â Not my job, chick! Â So I can&#39;t say I was surprised that our check was wrong, and we were billed twice for our wings.This might be one of those places that you just love if you&#39;re from the neighborhood.

We got boneless BBQ and hot jalapeno wings, cajun and chipotle ranch fries, mozz sticks, and pretzels with cheese. We were so healthy...Wings - big meaty pieces with a good crunch. The BBQ wings were a little on the sweet side, but delicious. The hot jalapeno were not hot at all, which was disappointing, but had great flavor.Fries - The cajun fries were hotter than the wings. Great seasoning, not overly salty and you get a boat load of them. The chipotle ranch fries were milder and was full of flavor. They have about 6 different fry options all coated in a dry rub. Not sure if they are hand cut fries or frozen to fryer but they were pretty good.Mozz Sticks - Delicious. You get 10! Usually places will only give you 4-6 but there was an abudence of this gooey cheesy god like food. Cooked well and the marinara dipping sauce was full of flavor.Pretzels - meh. Tasted like they were the frozen to microwave. Very stale and in comparison to the portions of the other food, not that much. Cheese sauce was too thick and lacked any flavor.This place had $10 domestic buckets and we went through 4.All in all it was surprisingly cheap. 5 people, all that food, and 4 buckets... only $80 bucks.We really want to come back and check it out on a non-trivia night!"jts-porch-saloon-and-eatery-lombard,David H.,uIQ28aqyEDoNU6X8aCK-IA,"Woodridge, IL",0,1,0,10,14,noyCouBthDAVhVjbySLvRQ,4,01/06/15,"Food is excellent!

Let&#39;s talk about the two favorite items that I go there for. The wings and the burgers. The wings are the best I have ever had. They are a different type of wings than your usual wing drenched in buffalo wing sauce. These wings are dry rubbed and they are the biggest wings around. 10 wings are more than enough for a meal.The heat comes from the amount of cayenne pepper they put in the dry rub. The hottest wings are red in color there is so much cayenne.The burgers are very large, juicy and flavorful. They are the same burgers they had at Halftime except for where they are cooked. Halftime would cook them on a grill right behind the bar. JT&#39;s cooks them in the kitchen. You can get either fries or home made chips. Both are very good.The large u-shaped bar is in the middle of the place with tables on two sides. The clientele range from the young 20&#39;s to the 50&#39;s depending on the time of day. This place is definitely not a place for families to go to. There is a nice patio also. If you want to try any of their food but do not want to eat in, they do have carry out service.They have a band each Saturday night.So if you want to go to a place with great food, non-yuppie type bar this is it."jts-porch-saloon-and-eatery-lombard,Morris N.,mgOgzP0SsxNzTVxvIWgjWA,"Chicago, IL",1,1,0,313,13,jqsf8_hLbYhbo8csgZ1Ing,4,13/09/11,"Servers are always attentive and nice.

The first time I got chips as a side and I guess this last visit in I was feeling a little crazy because I switched things up with a little chicken noodle soup action as my side.Both the wrap and soup were good. Nothing spectacular, but okay. The wrap is listed as a &#34;local favorite&#34; and is made up of a soft whole-wheat tortilla filled with grilled chicken breast, chopped romaine lettuce, tomato, avocado, and Monterey Jack cheese. Ranch dressing was served on the side. The ingredients were fresh and the wrap was satisfying, just nothing special. It was super messy to eat and it kept falling a part. Maybe it wasn&#39;t wrapped properly? Or maybe overstuffed? Who knows. I also wish that the ranch was just included in the wrap mixture, because dipping it on the side was quite difficult.The chicken noodle soup follows suit in that it was good, but nothing special. Could have been your regular old canned soup for all I know. We were set up with a pitcher of lemon water at the table, which is always ideal. I asked if they had iced green tea, but that was a no-go.Our waitress was very nice and efficient. The menu is pretty big and includes breakfast and lunch items.

I&#39;ve completely given up getting the hashbrowns as they are always way undercooked and raw. With a smattering of browning...on the outside. Inside potatoes...raw and uncooked. The one time I asked for them to be cooked more thoroughly, they just came almost burnt to a crisp outside but still raw and uncooked in the middle. That&#39;s it. No more hashbrowns even though I love them. Not from here. Anyhow, pancakes have usually been pretty dry. Today those were the saving grace. Fluffy and warm and yummy. But the eggs. Shudder. Gross and watery or greasy. Maybe from the cheese added but it didn&#39;t seem like cheese residue. And scrambled eggs shouldn&#39;t have slimy residue all around the edges. Just yucky. Â  The final straw for me that will have me not coming back anymore to give further chances for disappointment was the fruit. How can you mess up fruit, you ask?

I ordered the hazelnut, nutella and banana french toast. The french toast by itself was nearly $9.25. For 2 full slices of bread with half a banana and a sprinkling of nutella, that is crazy. I could see it being close to $10 if it included hash browns or sausage or eggs or something. But for the french toast alone, ridiculous. Frankly, the cheapest thing on the menu was eggs. 2 eggs by itself was $5.25. Um..wtf. The markup is crazy. Everyone else at the table ordered something similar to mine (aka some variation of french toast) and it was all the same price.

Plus one thing is for certain I have always liked the coffee refill service at Butterfield&#39;s. They are always on top of their game never an empty cup.I noticed on their chalkboard their homemade cream of spinach soup was one of the options. When I dine alone I am usually placed in their 2 seater booth, which I don&#39;t mind its cozy and all the condiments are right in front of you. I went forward and ordered a cup of soup and their Ham &amp; Swiss Panini. The fries were crispy and of course I loaded them up with Cholula sauce. Sliced pickles on the side was different and enjoyable compared to most places that give you a spear. The coleslaw is why I removed 1-star. I am more of a creamy coleslaw fan myself however there was no flavor and a thick texture to it. No worries, this did not spoil my mood. Their cream of spinach soup was FANTASTIC!!!

A two star is &#34;Meh, I&#39;ve experienced better&#34; If you screw up a skillet you&#39;re through. I had asked for a bacon and mushroom skillet instead of their bacon/onion option. When she served it up in record time, it looked full of onions, those are taters? I&#39;ve never seen half inch wide noodle shaped hash browns before. Some of them were 3 or 4&#34; long. I picked a couple out to test and they had the consistency of an uncooked potato, also not very warm. I did something I haven&#39;t done in a long time and sent it back. I should of tried a different item but asked to be sure to try and crisp up the taters. I brought half home as usual and will have to reheat upside down to crisp up the potatoes. (see pics) The second skillet was a little better but not too enjoyable.It had been some time since I was here for breakfast, as I used to frequent often when I lived in the area. I still use the same mechanic for 14 years so I may stop in here or Schmaltz when I drop off my vehicle for service. I was in the mood for a skillet today and Schmaltz Jewish Deli is very limited on breakfast items. They probably would of served my needs better and it may be a while before I return here. The super nice waitress did inform me they&#39;ve been getting a lot of complaints, so they are switching back to old style hash browns.The service was spot on, although I never really got a greeting from a host, (a waiter finally approached me) as I stood there a few minutes before someone asked if I wanted to be seated. A customer actually walked up and asked if I was meeting him here? Apparently people just walk in and stand there waiting for others to join them, so if you come in by yourself you best say something. You would think at 8:30 am there would be a host greeting guests.If memory serves I think that was what turned me off this place.

Although Ive ordered a lot of farmers skillets from other places, my skillet at Butterfields probably had the best proportion of meat to vegetable to cheese to hashbrown proportion Ive ever had, which meant that they did not skimp out on the protein.The friendly service and general atmosphere really give it an inviting feel that allows me to overlook its louder noise level.A tip: if you wanna sample the biscuits and gravy, i suggest ordering the biscuit as your side carb to your main dish (instead of rye bread, cornbread, or what not) and ordering just a side of gravy (its cheaper that way)!"butterfields-pancake-house-and-restaurant-naperville,Rona B.,8yZTkSuuPbrqWmOgaysUBg,"Naperville, IL",0,1,0,0,2324,Ar7WGij_U2OERb54MlJAPw,4,17/01/16,"I went at a busy time.

They be nimble and they be quick here... and now I&#39;m prepared to not sleep till March.B-field&#39;s is a super spacious breakfast, brunch, and lunch spot located about 7 minutes from downtown Naperville.

I like that they offer a variety of health conscious b-fast as well as the standard (and super tasty) artery cloggers. I&#39;ve been here when I was dying for some fatty food but went with their berry-granola-yogurt thinking I&#39;d be sacrificing flavor in order to be more fit but that wasn&#39;t the case at all. Turns out their berry-granola-yogurt combo is made of angel&#39;s wings with just a pinch of kitten dreams and not a sacrifice in the least. I&#39;ve also gotten their artichoke frittata and avocado bacon wrap (sans bacon) which sounded like pure heaven, but in actuality not nearly as good as I remembered the granola dish to be. Also, their guacamole (comes with the avocado bacon wrap) was surprisingly good.For my next visit I&#39;m going to get the spinach and Gruyere crepes.For my next visit after that I&#39;m going to get the portobello benedict.And for my visit after that one I&#39;m going to get the taffy apple french toast.I could probably go on and write out what I plan on getting for my next 7 meals here but I don&#39;t want to sway your opinion too much.

Â Dining for breakfast seemed like a good idea. Â It was a Saturday morning, around 10am and the parking lot was packed, but we were quickly shown to our seats by a pleasant a courteous staff. Â The first great impression was the coffee, it&#39;s not Starbucks but it was hot, strong and well brewed. Â We got real cream and a pitcher of water with lemon appeared on the table. Â So far so good. The menu is very large and has all the usual breakfast items, boasting that they crack eggs to order. Â My daughter had pecan pancakes (minus the bananas), I ordered eggs over easy, sausage links, rye toast and Â the orange juice. Â  I had heard raves about the fresh squeezed orange juice, and it is on display when you come in the front door....an automatic contraption that holds the oranges, splits them, juices them and delivers the juice into a vessel at the bottom. Â You gotta have it, right? Â At $3.79 for a large glass, which I estimate to be 10 ounces, that&#39;s a tad pricey. Â But I wanted it! Â Service was prompt. Â The &#34;pecan&#34; pancakes were standard pancakes with pecans strewn over them, no real effort there. Â My eggs were a little runny on the whites, the hash browns were meh, and the sausage links (large country style) were too salty. Â My rye toast was barely toasted, just warm and too soft to qualify as toast. Â But the biggest surprise to my uber critical palate was the orange juice. Â It&#39;s delicious, but largely because it is sweetened with sugar. Â No fresh orange juice is that sweet. Â Bet my paycheck they hit it with sugar or simple syrup.... you can taste it. Â I didn&#39;t send anything back, I didn&#39;t complain because nothing was that bad, just not that great. Â If I ordered eggs again I&#39;d probably try an omellette if they are not brown, skip the over salty sausage in lieu of either bacon or ham, ask for extra dark toast and pass on the potatoes and perhaps try one of the two types of grits (cheese/no cheese) that are on the menu. Â There are Â lots of other options on the menu that could be a lot better than what we chose.I am giving it three stars because nothing was obnoxious, and I might even go back again because the coffee is decent, service was attentive, and pleasant without being cloying and I now know what not to get and how to tailor my order., and there is a lot more on the menu. But there are families giving that oj to their children... might want to skip that and stick to milk, unless that is also sweetened. Â I wish I could sweeten this review, but this is the best I can do. Â I am coming down a bit hard because with tax and tip breakfast was about $33.00, and remember my daughter had pecan pancakes only...no other sides, no meat...so one expects the bar to be set high!"butterfields-pancake-house-and-restaurant-naperville,A O.,PU19AnreypmWp5tXxv9Nag,"Aurora, IL",0,1,0,0,42,ZDcA0w1AdczMiDDnzzeYOg,3,05/12/15,"Nice to see the service still stinks here.

For someone who makes perfect eggs himself, he was quite impressed. Everything came out so quickly, was hot, and was fresh.The only thing that would keep me from coming back here besides the distance to my home, would be the noise level.

Now that we live in St Charles, this was the first time back in the area and decided to stop in for breakfast. There was the typical crowd out front, but it was only a 10min wait.We both ordered a couple of poached eggs to share and side of biscuit and gray. The eggs were done to perfection (and are not $5.35 as noted by another poster- that&#39;s if you want toast and hash browns... these were $1.35 each egg. The gravy was OK- tasteful- but one of the biscuits was hard.In reminiscing on our favorites- I ordered my personal fav was the Strawberry cheese stuffed french toast. Hers was the Mexican Burrito. My wife was pleased with hers... Me, not so much. It used to be the strawberry &#34;sauce&#34; was homemade from strawberries. And... there were lots of strawberries stuffed in them.The order I received had about 3 strawberries sliced on top of the french toast... and about a total of two slices of strawberries stuffed. It was sad, I actually opened up the french toast just to see where I could get french toast, cheese and strawberry! For almost $10- Butterfields can do better. I get great Berries from the store during the winter months. The last piece I hated was the use of strawberry &#34;gel&#34; - an artificially flavored gel for overlaying on cheap pies.Can&#39;t say how much I was disappointed that my old favorite had changed so much.

(I considered only one star).So it&#39;s Mother&#39;s Day and we had reservations for when they opened. It was our first time here and there was only five or six other tables sat. Drinks took a long time to get, ordering food took a long time, and getting extra anything (napkins, condiments, tortillas, etc) took a long time. Nobody made us aware of the day&#39;s specials either. I found out they existed after we ate. The food came quickly and tasted awesome! I would say today&#39;s crew was made up of inefficient servers/bar staff and/or they were short staffedAgain, the food was fantastic.So it came time to pay. I was short changed on purpose. My &#34;change&#34; was rounded down. Well my receipt said I was still owed a measly 46 cents. It&#39;s about the principal. The server acknowledged doing it and said she didn&#39;t have 46 cents. so it was rounded down. (So are they just taking everyone&#39;s change each shift? That&#39;s called stealing.) Two additional staff members scoffed at me and fetched 45 cents from the bar resister and made a snide remark while giving me the change. I tipped well at the table before speaking with them at the front desk on the way out and now I wish I hadn&#39;t after this treatment over the stupid 46 cents that was suppose to be mine after paying in the first place. Geez...I&#39;ve been a bus boy, a host/cashier, a server, and a bartender and never did this to anyone. I was so taken aback that I created a Yelp account to add my 2 cents... the food was really great though."aguamiel-clarendon-hills,Laura C.,zAOSb0UladctfhSbrrOxHw,"Downers Grove, IL",1,1,1,44,9,A4sYEFdjQGEvd-v5agsWMw,2,05/01/16,"Felt I needed to update my previous not-so-great review.

Â We ordered a bottle of $35 wine. Â The server came back and said that they were out of our chosen bottle, recommended another wine and said he would &#39;make a deal&#39; with us. Â When the check came, the $35 wine turned into a $75 wine. Â We politely protested and he brought out the owner, which is where the problem escalated.The owner was condescending and rude. She agreed to reduce the cost from $75 to $52, stating that $52 was her cost. (I do not know of a restaurant that only marks wine up by 50%...) Â When we explained that $52 was still unreasonable, and that we expected to be charged $35 for whatever the server recommended, she threw the server under the bus and tried to guilt us into paying more by saying &#34;do you think it&#39;s fair for the server to have to pay the difference&#34;. Â We suggested that that was between her and her server and had nothing to do with the fact that we were dissatisfied.This episode occurred in the middle of the restaurant at about 8pm on a Friday night. It was very uncomfortable. Â We have never been in a situation where a restaurant owner did not make things right. Â Our total check was about $140, so there was ample room for the owner to make an adjustment.In the end, we had no choice but to pay the additional $17. Â Unfortunately, the server ended up on the short end of the stick because his tip was reduced to account for the overcharged wine.

Â High expectations were exceeded by the top notch restaurant Aguamiel, named after the honeywater of the agave plant (that becomes tequila and mezcal) which can be fermented into pulque. Â The place is situated in the center of town among gift shops and an ice cream parlor and abundant parking. Â Inside the restaurant was toasty in winter and cozy with a fireplace, hand blown glasses on the tables matched by hanging lampshades at the bar, and intriguing art including humanscale sculpture, paintings and the restaurant&#39;s insignia in metal above the fireplace. Â Chef Kike&#39;s signature sauces shine at Aguamiel. Â From the table salsas served with tortilla chips to the spicy brightly acidic tomato guajillo sauce cutting the rich slow cooked shortribs, the flavors were big and bold.The best may have been the smoky serrano chile sauce accompanying the grilled shrimp entree- deeply flavorful, complex, a hot herbacious campfire. Â Ceviche was a mouthwateringly acidic starter with albacore tuna cooked in the acid of lime, the heat of chiles accented by the salt of diced olives. Â Sopes featured rich shredded beef in buttery corn masa complimented by roasted tomatoes and onions. Â The food was so delicious. Â To drink we split a half pitcher of 1800 margarita- blanco tequila, fresh squeezed lime, limey and bright with a touch of sweetness from agave nectar, and a half pitcher of the cadillac margarita- smoother and rounder from tequila aged in oak, orange liquor lingering on the palette. Â Both were excellent, as was the prompt service.

Â The waiter was attentive but not intrusive. Â The two salsas (served with tortilla chips) were a little less spicy than I usually like, but the flavors were interesting enough to make them delicious. Â The guacamole of the day had habanero in it, and at first I thought there was a mistake as it was undetectable. Â As we ate, I began to notice a subtle burn, and by the end of the little bowl, my lips were lightly burning and tingling from the heat, so I think it was perfectly seasoned for a serving for two people.I had the vegetarian chile, and the flavor was superb. Â Nicely spicy and smoky, with plenty of good vegetables and cheese in the ample-sized &#34;open face&#34; chile. Â My husband loved his quesadilla special that included shrimp.The drink specials looked good as well; we settled on the gold margaritas that were amply-sized.We will definitely be back!"aguamiel-clarendon-hills,Marie L.,l8vl6OaT8Wezzd0hnVpAkg,"Hinsdale, IL",0,1,0,0,10,Pkv7maboZdlihQDsCrhjvg,4,15/07/13,"My husband and I have been coming here for quite some time now.Our first few visits were outstanding! As for the last 10 or so it&#39;s been on the steep incline.My past visits we always enjoyed the margaritas, now I am pregnant and can only drink iced tea or some sort of boring beverage. I am very thirsty being pregnant so I had 4 of them, mind you they fill the small glasses ALL the way to the top with ice so it&#39;s literally like 5 sips, I was charged $3.00 EACH! I was baffeled, how can you charge for iced tea? it&#39;s water and tea bags? Â $12! UGH! Seriously Aguamiel? I would have much rather had a margarita at that price (if I could), Also the waiter brought me a lemonade instead of a iced tea and still had the nerve to charge me for it.The waiter was also annoyed that I had him ask if their cheese was pasteurized. He was annoyed by this, this isn&#39;t the first time I had this waiter and he is very rude and was caring more about the large party that was also his table so we had to wait, I literally had to wait to get another iced tea for 20 minutes, then another 15 minutes for the sour cream I asked for 3 times.Also I asked to wrap my leftovers and give me more flour tortillas as he gave my husband corn on accident, then on the bill we were also charged for those tortillas we didn&#39;t even want, not to mention sour creamIt&#39;s not like you give us credit for the items we don&#39;t want on our bill so don&#39;t nickel and dime us for everything dinner shouldn&#39;t cost $85 without alcohol for 2 people.Disappointed, I don&#39;t know if we will be back.

The food is outstanding. Very fresh and flavorful. Certainly a welcome addition to the area. The prices are really good considering the neighborhood. Then there are the margaritas! By far one of the best I&#39;ve had outside of Mexico. Splurge and get the Cadillac, you won&#39;t be disappointed, great fresh flavor and no sickeningly sweet triple sec. Also take the server recommendations, they were spot on. The fish tacos are amazing for so few ingredients and the carnitas are melt in your mouth. My friend had the stuffed peppers and loved the combination of fillings. The tortillas are handmade, soft and delicious.The service is working out the kinks of being new, but no issues that can&#39;t be overcome with time. The servers I have had have all been very informative on the menu. My biggest pet peeve in restaurants is patrons asking the busboy for things out of his scope of work. FYI a busboy can&#39;t order food for you or get you another drink, other than water. There are certainly places that have ultra experienced busboys that will go tell the server what is needed but this guy can just do the basics which is fine, he is still doing his job and doing it well. I had people next to us complaining that he was &#34;incompetent and didn&#39;t even speak English.&#34; Get a clue folks and stop being so ignorant.They are very kid friendly which I would normally not be thrilled about, but since having a two year old nephew that has been dining out since 3 months, I appreciate a place we can all go. Btw, he loved the guacamole. I guess he&#39;s not really your typical 2 year old. The management knows how to seat a dining room because everyone cringes when they see the kid in the high chair. They put us up front by the windows and sat other patrons in another section. Granted this was very early on a Sunday night so they had the luxury of an empty restaurant to begin with. They also have plastic cups with straws for water that are given to all kids.Try Aguamiel, I&#39;ll be shocked if you are disappointed."aguamiel-clarendon-hills,Kate W.,gqimocAPnvr9V-YjYhfElg,"Philadelphia, PA",0,1,1,211,12,8bXsziMpXP4WZeNwXgkrYA,4,07/04/13,"Truly about 3.5 stars, but I&#39;m giving rounding up for the star rating since halves are overly fussy. Â Food was delicious, service could use a little improvement.We arrived at 8pm on a Friday and were told it would be a 30 minute wait for 3, but we waited only half of that before being seated. Â The bar was packed so we had to awkwardly plaster ourselves against the half-wall that separates the bar from the busy pathway to the kitchen. Â Be smarter than we were and make a reservation!I liked the look of the dining area, but it&#39;s so LOUD. Â Not a good place for a first date or catching up with an old friend.The service - our waiter was perfectly nice and got our orders right, so yay for that. Â However, food runners tried to deliver other tables&#39; food and drinks to us three times throughout the night, and our own waiter couldn&#39;t remember who ordered what when our entrees came. Â Little details, but that&#39;s the stuff that would set this place apart from the competition, if they could get the details right.I had a regular margarita - fine, not awesome, I&#39;m sure if I had upgraded my tequila it would have been better.The food is where this place shines. Â I started with the ensalada fresca - jicama, cucumbers, and pineapple, with a little kick of chile powder. Â Not only does it look amazing (and had diners at other tables asking me what I ordered) but it tastes fantastic - refreshing and fun. Â My mom started with a special appetizer - tamales - which were very good (though were a little heavy on the masa/light on the meat for us), and my dad had the sopa classica, which was outstanding.For entrees, I had the camarones ala diabla (shrimp in some spicy sauce, with rice and zucchini). Â They weren&#39;t kidding around with the spice here - very good, but not for the faint of heart - or rather, stomach. Â If you typically order things medium or mild, this would probably not be a good choice for you, but if you&#39;re like me and love some heat, have at it.My mom had the quesadilla with chicken and said it was wonderful (and she knows her quesadillas - that&#39;s her standard order when we go Mexican), and my dad went with a taco trio - al pastor (too sweet for him, I tried it &amp; thought it was good), carne asada (great), and pollo (his favorite).I&#39;m surprised at how affordable everything was - parents&#39; entrees were under $10, mine was almost $20 (darn shrimp), apps were all under $10.

Â Fortunately, we made a reservation. Since we just ate at CiNe, we were looking forward to dining at the neighborhood&#39;s other new Mexican restaurant. Like CiNe, this is is not the normal suburban burrito and fajita experience. The menu looked appetizing as there were numerous selections that looked muy bueno. Most dishes were less than $15. Started off with chips and salsas, green and red. Â Chips were overly salty and they masked the taste of the salsas. The red salsa could have been a bit spicier. For dinner, I had the chicken enchiladas with a dark mole sauce. Â They were good, but were not hot enough. And the rice and refried sides were luke warm as well. My wife ordered the chicken tostada which she also enjoyed. Â Children&#39;s menu available for $6. Service could have been better. Â Maybe they just need more help. Besides one dish not being prepared as we requested, a second basket of chips never arrived and the waiter never asked whether we wanted dessert, just dropped off the check. Â Plus, one dish was also never cleared from the table. Management was very friendly and checked on us a few times. Â Beware, the dining room is inordinately loud. Or maybe I just need a hearing aid, which my wife would agree with!Compared to CiNe, the portions at Aguamiel are more authentic, larger and at a lower cost. Â Quality is similar. Â The atmosphere at CiNe is more to my liking and is not as loud. Plus, CiNe&#39;s chips and salsa were superior--I love my chips!My disclaimer: Â I&#39;m a California native so I take my Mexican seriously. We are deprived here in the Western burbs so I have high hopes for Aquamiel.

We had heard good things from a few people, so I was really excited to try it out!My dad had a really great margarita that was like a combination of a pina colada and a marg. If i didn&#39;t consume a 47 ounce margarita somewhere else the night before, I would have drank 5 of these :) One of the most delicious flavored margaritas I&#39;ve ever had!We started with guacamole which was outstanding. Good texture, nice flavor without being too spicy. You can tell it was super fresh. I loved how the chips were thick enough to hold up the guacamole! My dad ordered the tortilla soup and really enjoyed it.We each had the 3 taco platter. I chose 1 al pastor, and 2 carne asada. The Al Pastor sounded really interesting, with adobo flavoring and topped with bacon and pineapple. The smokiness of the adobo was almost a little too much for me, but the bright pineapple flavor cut through and the bacon was a nice addition. I was super excited for my steak tacos, which were supposed to be marinated skirt steak with grilled onions. Imagine my disappointment when they arrived with chopped, raw onion, and loaded with some cilantro type of sauce. They were good, but I really don&#39;t like raw onions and a lot of cilantro, so they weren&#39;t as enjoyable as I was expecting. My sister had the same as me and was disappointed by the same aspects. I only ate one taco and two bites of another.My dad decided to get dessert - a mexican bread pudding and some mexican coffee. You&#39;d think the coffee would come pretty quickly, yes? No. almost 10 minutes pass, and someone drops off our check - without the coffee or dessert on there. Why? I don&#39;t know. It took a few minutes to flag someone down to tell them what was going on, then he took the check away and said he&#39;d be back - we weren&#39;t really quite sure if we were still going to get the items my dad had ordered or not, but then the coffee arrived. I tried a sip and it was outstanding! So many bold, delicious flavors, I would honestly come back here just to have a cup of coffee. About 10 minutes later, the bread pudding shows up. Our server explains that he dropped the first one and the chef had to make another, which is why it took so long. Well, the bread pudding was delicious too, and was served with what I think might have been pistachio ice cream. Creamy, crispy, and warm, this was a lovely dessert.It took a while to get an updated check, then to have someone come get the credit card, then to have them come back with it. I don&#39;t think that guacamole, tacos, and bread pudding warranted an hour and 45 minute long dining experience, but maybe I&#39;m just antsy.I would probably try this place out again, but make sure that my tacos come with what they&#39;re supposed to. And hopefully there is a better waitstaff around too, the Â service was pretty spotty."aguamiel-clarendon-hills,Elise F.,OugqFU_T_c99qSoVRkwiYw,"Downers Grove, IL",0,1,0,0,5,GpSX70LS6Ireb4UnbVK8dw,3,28/07/13,In simple terms this place is a Honda with a Mercedes logo slapped on it. The staff is very poorly motivated to help and the food was extremely just okay.

Â Terrific salsas, moles, guacamole, tacos, margaritas, and several terrific platos fuertes (entrees). Â Loved, loved, loved the place. Â We made sure we were there at least a couple times a month.Unfortunately, our last couple of visits have been somewhat disappointing. Â Portions have shrunk considerably, and several of the dishes seem to have lost their kick. Â Has Chef Kike turned the kitchen over to a much less capable sous chef? Â I&#39;m not sure what, exactly, is going on, but if this trend continues, I&#39;m afraid we will be writing this place off -- which would be really sad given how much I loved this place."aguamiel-clarendon-hills,Judd K.,j5Kx1W2EXWpXc1viLrxUxA,"Chicago, IL",0,1,1,21,11,NqQkkjeoYDtOwZtOVSB_KQ,3,05/01/13,"Aguamiel is excellent and getting better each time I visit. Â The tacos are so good that I haven&#39;t ventured too much farther on the menu during my four visits. Â The bar has an excellent selection of tequila and an adequate selection of most other beverages. Â The gold margarita is excellent. Â I have been waiting to write this review until after trying Cine. Â Last night was my first experience there, and now I must wonder what kind of herbs those who prefer Cine to this place are smoking. Â Cine is more trendy and highly designed inside, but both spaces are attractive. Â Cine has a slightly better bar selection. Â Service seems about equal at both places, though both are relatively new and I&#39;ve seen staff missteps at both places. Â At the end of everything, the determining factor for a restaurant must be the food, and in my opinion Aguamiel has *much* better food at a slightly cheaper price compared to Cine. Â Aquamiel boasts a wide selection of amazing tacos, all of which can be mixed and matched. Â The carnitas and pork belly are to die for, and the fried fish taco is the best of that genre I have ever tried. Â I will be back. Â Drive on in to downtown Clarendon Hills for the tacos here.

The menu looked interesting and a step beyond the normal suburban Mexican restaurant. Â Six of us arrived early but were seated within five minutes of our reservation time. Â The interior is trendy - Â I thought I could be in a Â small restaurant in River North. The place was packed.To start off, the obligatory chips seemed to be the same ones we get at Costco. First batch was served cold, the second batch was warm. The two salsas were good.I ordered the Al Pastor Tacos. I really enjoyed them. The taste of pineapple contrasted well with the meat, but the tacos were supposed to have &#34;crisp bacon&#34; but I could not taste nor see any bacon. This was one of the reasons I ordered these tacos. Â The beans and rice were barely lukewarm. My wife had a mix of tacos. Two were good, the fish taco was rather poor - think &#34;fish sticks&#34;. Other meals were actually pretty good.The service was inexcusable. We go out for fine dining at least once a month and this the worse service we have had in many years. The waiter was was pleasant enough and seemed knowledgeable about the menu , but was very absent minded and non-attentive. We ordered guacamole. It never came. I ordered Â a drink, that did not come until I was well in to my meal, and the was after prompting the waiter. Many of the drinks were filled to the rim - which on one hand is nice. But my wife&#39;s drink spilled some and she cleaned up with the napkin - the waiter did not offer any assistance. We asked for a napkin. It never came - we grabbed one from another table. We went through the water and asked for another carafe. It never arrived. Â Also, at a place like this I do not expect the meals to be auctioned when they are brought to the tables. So the last one is a bit petty but this there seemed to be Â a trend.Prices were very reasonable. The main dishes ran from $12 to upper 20&#39;s as I recall..This place is also really loud - think Pappadeux and multiple times 2. Â How about some fabrics to deafen the sound?I really wanted to like this restaurant. I suspect if I came back and had an experienced server this would be a 4-5 star review.

We also had one of the top shelf margaritas last time which was the best, but knocked us on our a$$! :)I had the chicken mole based on the reviews- Â it was delicious. It wasn&#39;t what I was expecting at all, but so good I nearly licked the plate clean. The other two in the party shared the 6 taco platter.

Â So presumably, there are some bugs to be worked out.It was very crowded and the layout of the bar made it difficult to find a place to wait where we weren&#39;t in the way of the waitstaff in the back or standing in the open doorway. Â The bar staff (of 1) seemed completely overwhelmed. Â Luckily another set of hands hopped in to help out, but while that helped the speed of service, we didn&#39;t get the margarit&#39;s we actually ordered, but instead got the standard house version. They were ok, but we are not fans of the sour-mix margarita, so we did not get off to a good start.We did get seated in the time estimated, which was a pleasant surprise. And the chips and salsa arrived promptly. Â The chips were clearly homemade and very fresh and the salsa was good as well.They clearly were open a little too soon, as the menus were paper copies and we informed that the bar could not actually make our 1st 2 drink choices. Â We then went back to ordering a fairly standard margarita, though with premium tequila and lime juice v sourmix and these were very good.The highlight of the night was however, the food. Â We were excited that the exec chef had experience at Frontera/Topolobampo and that was evident from the food. Â I had the pork tenderloin which was tender and flavorful. Â My husband went with the chicken mole and was more than pleased. Â It was nice to be in a Mexican restaurant that didn&#39;t have a standard Pepe&#39;s/Uncle Julio&#39;s-style menu.We did order another round of margaritas, which never arrived (luckily we didn&#39;t get charged for them either, though we did see the drinks they couldn&#39;t make appear on the bill). Â We noticed and experienced a rather long wait time to take our order, come back to ask about dessert, deliver our bill, and refill our water glasses (which never happened).So, there are obviously some servie issues which need to be worked out, but the quality of the food and reasonableness of the prices should definitely make you want to give it a try. Â We will be returning in a few weeks to see if they&#39;ve gotten the kinks worked out. Â The food is well worth it.

Â The breakfast sausage patties were thin and unremarkable. The biscuits and gravy was fairly weak on flavor and thin on sausage.My wife&#39;s waffle came with a huge glob of butter in the middle.

It looks impossibly small and completely unassuming from the outside, but inside its kinda spacious and delightful. We came here last weekend at about 11AM and had a choice of tables - sooo much better than the inevitable wait at most breakfast joints around here! Our server was kind and helpful, explaining the specials and highlighting favorite items. I tried a cup of the cream of chicken &amp; rice soup and it was very tasty. For my meal, I had the biscuits and gravy with fried chicken and it was awesome. Fluffy homemade biscuits, rich sausage gravy and a perfectly cooked, crispy fried boneless chicken breast with two eggs over easy. Decadent, huge portion, not too salty/greasy, just perfect. My mom got an omelette with a morning glory square on the side which was an interesting menu item, kind of carrot-cake-y but with a banana bread texture. Really good! My husband got the chicken and waffles which was actually amazing, the malted waffle batter might have been my favorite thing at the whole table and I got swatted away more than once sneaking extra bites of that awesome waffle. Our server was kind, prompt, knowledgeable of the menu and seemed to really take pride in the items on the menu, pointing out to us that the coffee cakes are baked in house and even gesturing over to the cook who makes them. I thought this was a nice touch.Overall, an excellent breakfast spot. I&#39;m bummed I waited so long to try it, but now that I know about it, I can&#39;t wait till our next visit."the-lucky-penny-diner-and-deli-naperville-2,Ashley M.,YMYb73K3Dv3oiac4mADJSg,"Atlanta, GA",1,1,1,685,38,oXZq3dlOylEYm70hPC41Wg,5,04/07/16,"My boyfriend and I were looking for a breakfast option in the area and we ended up really loving this place! We enjoyed the establishment before this one and its recent change of owners so decided to come back and give this new restaurant a shot.Upon walking in, we immediately notice this restaurant is busy. There were only a handful of open tables, but we were quickly greeted and seated. The restaurant is very clean and the staff is extremely friendly. The specials are listed on a large board at the back of the restaurant and I quickly noticed many of their dishes have a Southwestern flair, containing ingredients such as chorizo or accompanied by salsa. They have traditional American breakfast dishes as well, but I chose to go outside of the box and order the Carintas Waffles:Topped with slow cooked, perfectly seasoned pulled pork, chipotle crema, salsa verde, cojita cheese, and fresh cilantro. There is no need for syrup. At first glance, this sounds pretty weird, but I really, really enjoyed this dish! It comes with a heaping ton of carnitas and the chipotle crema and salsa verde is the perfect accompaniment to the fresh, warm waffle. I would recommend trying this creative dish if you&#39;re looking for something different!I&#39;d also like to add kudos to this place for trying oh-so-hard for business: we noticed the staff was highly attentive, including whom I assume to be the owner, refilling coffee and working tables. They&#39;ve also done a great job with their website for being a smaller restaurant, with appetizing pictures of their menu selections and detailed descriptions so my boyfriend and I knew exactly what we had to look forward to before even arriving!Great job, keep up the good work and delicious food, and we can&#39;t wait to come back!"the-lucky-penny-diner-and-deli-naperville-2,Dave G.,eZ1dsD2KtEiS0NyU8eegcg,"Aurora, IL",0,1,0,5,53,qqpCP8olEo_zcHeIgqzjWQ,4,19/09/16,"I. Love. Breakfast. Â Seriously, every other meal is optional. Â During the busy workweek, I don&#39;t always have the option (read never have the option) to sit down and enjoy breakfast. Â On the weekends, I strive to have one sit-down breakfast on the weekend.This is the place Naperville has been missing. Â It&#39;s a small hidden treasure of food nirvana. Â Everything else in the area feels the same, but this is a locally owned and operated breakfast destination.I&#39;ve been here a handful of times. Â The first few were scouting expeditions, prior to introducing my wife to the goodness that awaits behind the hidden, yet blatantly obvious entrance. Â Once you walk in the door, you&#39;re greeted by a member of the friendly staff. Â It might be the host. Â If the host is busy seating someone else, it might be a server. Â Seemingly there&#39;s no &#34;this is your job, this is my job&#34;. Â No waiting for &#34;your server&#34; to refill your coffee.

Â Most everything is homemade (it might all be homemade). Â The corned beef hash...if you remotely like corned beef hash - get it. Â BiscuitsThe portions are decently sized. Â Not crazy-assed Texas sized portions that seem to be the trend. Â The eggs are actually cooked to your preference. Â I&#39;ve been a few places where &#34;over-medium&#34; = &#34;way less than over-easy&#34;.Can we talk homemade jams? Â Or is it jelly? Â What&#39;s the difference again? Â What ever the smashed-fruit goodness that you put on toast for breakfast dessert is called...that in itself if almost worth the trip.At the end of your meal and the check comes.

Sourdough with ham, blueberry jam (what?!), and a fried egg. Very unique, very flavorful. My husband had a scramble and I had a bite -- onions were actually completely cooked and nicely diced (it&#39;s a pet peeve of mine in diners when they onions are still hard and unevenly chopped).

Do NOT miss out on the coffee cake, it&#39;s homemade. I got the Bavarian cream and he got the blueberry, both were phenomenal. My mom makes good coffee cake and this beat it hands down. I also got a mimosa which was very good. You gotta love a nice mimosa on your day off!All in all we loved it!

The burger was cooked a perfect medium rare and came with some house made fries that were crunchy and tasty. Throw in an iced tea and that&#39;s a pretty damn good lunch.But the best part was Penny and her hospitality. She knew my name and came and sat down again to visit. And then she let me taste test a new item she&#39;s working on that includes waffles, house made chorizo, an egg and chipotle creme and salsa verde. It was pretty tasty and definitely unique. Can&#39;t wait to see it on the menu.Also nice to see a little crowd on hand at lunch time.

We got seated with just our party and a waitress asked about drinks. Â We only had one coffee cup on the table so my husband got his cup of coffee right away, I asked for decaf and a milk for my LO.

Â I asked for pancakes, instead of toast. Â I thought it was weird there was a $1 up charge for basic pancakes. Â We go out to breakfast and have tried multiple breakfast joints in Naperville and never seen an up charge for basic pancakes. Â Overall, my meal was just ok. Â My scrambled eggs were a little over done and the bacon was just ok.I ordered the one egg kids meal for my LO, it came with an egg, meat and starch (toast or pancake). Â The meal was sufficient for my LO but when we got the bill, it showed an up charge of $2 for bacon. Â The bill was corrected but I am glad I checked everything.Hubby ordered a make your own skillet and upgraded his toast with the blueberry coffee cake.

I&#39;ve lived near this location for years and have seen a few restaurants come and go. If my first experience is any indication, I think Lucky Penny is going to be my favorite cafe that&#39;s been in this spot.The owner, Penny, served my breakfast, kept my coffee fresh, and chatted with me. Her passion for her work was apparent from the start; I felt very welcome, and I could tell she was excited and proud of her food. It&#39;s always so cool to see someone passionate about what they do. I still miss my dearly departed Wicked Good CafÃ©, and this was the first time since then that I&#39;ve found a place that&#39;s as warm and friendly as they were.I had eggs benedict, hash browns, and coffee. The serving size is generous - I need to keep that in mind and order light when I go in so early in the morning. When I get restaurant hash browns, I honestly don&#39;t expect much, but these were carefully seasoned; the salt-and-pepper blend made them special. The eggs benedict had strips of ham instead those fried discs that many restaurants use, so they were cooked evenly and were tastier. I think there was some paprika in the sauce; it was yummy.The coffee was a standout. I take two creams and half a sugar in my coffee, so when Penny refilled it partway through my first cup, I thought I would need to add more of both. Instead, it was so smooth and mild that I put away 2 or 2 1/2 cups without having to add any more flavoring. Very impressed with the coffee.It always feels so satisfying to support a local business, and I&#39;m so pleased to have a high-quality one right near my house.

Our waitress asked me &#34;Everything?&#34; I answered affirmatively, but then she asked about mushrooms and I said &#34;hell no&#34; but in different words and more politely. After she left, I wondered who the hell would put mushrooms on a hot dog? Ewww. I&#39;m pretty sure she was joking around but still....When our food was brought out, I shit you not, all I saw was a mound of toppings. It was awesome! A beautiful quarter pound hot dog with lettuce, pico de gallo, huge pickles sliced round, a beautiful slice of pepper jack cheese, and god knows what else, but it was delicious. It was quite filling paired with the tator tots. M successfully ate every scrap of his breakfast. As I watched his eyes roll into the back of his head, I knew a nap was in his immediate future.I can&#39;t comment on the inside, as we&#39;ve always sat out on the patio, but that&#39;s where I prefer to be. As others have said, it&#39;s a bit hard to find if you&#39;re not familiar with the area, and your first attempt to park can be confusing as well.

We&#39;re headed back to Bartlett from the Aurora Premium Outlets. Hunger strikes! Â Gammon Coach House is basically on our way home and so our lunch problem appears to be solved.We entered the somewhat cramped establishment with pretty low expectations. What we experienced was the exact opposite. Success!It was a cold October afternoon, so no one was eating out on the patio. It is a nice additional space for seating though. We had the option of bar seating, a table on the bar side or any one of the six or so tables on the other side. We went to the least crowded area on the other side and made ourselves comfortable.Our server was very sweet. Unnecessary side note: She was a hired server at Jenny McCarthy&#39;s Halloween Party in Geneva the night before and couldn&#39;t get all of the professional vampire makeup off of herself. She was kind enough to let us know that she wasn&#39;t in a car accident or anything like that earlier and that it was just makeup. It made for great conversation with her! Â And we&#39;re back to your regularly scheduled review...We started with chips &amp; salsa and onion rings. The salsa was homemade and quite good. The onion rings stole the show! Â Crisp beer batter that wasn&#39;t too heavy. Those were delicious!!We tried the chili and the chicken tortilla soup. Both were obviously made fresh and really tasty. My beef? Â The chicken tortilla soup was loaded with cheese...and it didn&#39;t say that on the menu. I scooped out what I could and proceeded to eat. No crunchy tortilla strips here. Fresh corn tortilla pieces throughout with chicken breast chunks. Woo hoo!!Around the table were patty melts, a grilled cheese and a burger with fries, tater tots and sweet potato tater tots as the side dishes. Â The burgers were hand packed and served on bakery type buns. Actually all of the bread was bakery quality. The sweet potato tater tots seem to be their own creation while the fries and regular tater tots were your standard frozen variety that weren&#39;t exciting. Â I think I read that someone said that you don&#39;t come here for the food. I totally disagree. I&#39;d make the effort to come back for the food. I might even order the same meal sans cheese of course!Everyone around the table was pleased with the food. And the beer menu was extensive. We weren&#39;t drinking, but there was a nice variety available. The only other complaint was that although we had good attention during the meal, we think we may have been forgotten about in the side room once we were done eating. We had to eventually go ask our server for a box and the check. Not a huge problem, but the layout is not conducive to being able to see everything from one room to the next.I&#39;m sorry that we didn&#39;t try a homemade dessert. I should have saved room.

Â Since it was close to home &amp; Kelly&#39;s last dinner before a business trip, we decided to check it out.Visually, the place isn&#39;t much to look at. Â A small bar with a few tables on the inside with outdoor patio. Â Since it was in the upper 60&#39;s for March, we dined on the patio. Â Service was excellent but it wasn&#39;t overly busy for Monday night at 6.They have 2 menus, one for food &amp; one for beer. Â That&#39;a a good sign in my opinion. Â Let&#39;s talk brew frist. Â  Â They had probably 30-40 craft/micro beers to choose from with others on tap. Â Kelly &amp; I ordered a couple beers. Â I tried a new one that sounded good but didn&#39;t like it at all. Â I ordered a more familiar beer that I enjoy. Â They were out of it but the waitress brought a sample of a beer on tap that was similar that I enjoyed so I ordered that. Â Nice. Â She Â also removed the bad beer from the bill! Â Kelly enjoyed her beer but we didn&#39;t order another since she wanted to get home to prepare for the trip.As for the grub, it&#39;s a smaller food menu with your usual bar/American fare. Â Since burger was on special (&amp; the lone guy outside had one that looked great), I ordered that &amp; the sweet tater tots. Â Kelly ordered a corned beef reuben. Â Food came out quickly &amp; was very good. Â My burder was very tasty with a great brioche bun. Â The sweet tater tots were spot on but needed a little salt for my liking. Â Kelly said her reuben was the best one she&#39;d ever had. Â  The check came quickly after we were done &amp; was taken care of in under 5 minutes.All in all, it was a very enjoyable, affordable, unpretentious, Â comfortable dining experience with great service!

Â The place has great atmosphere! Â The menu is limited which is a good thing because too much to choose from just makes for a complicated meal sometimes ya know?! Â What you get here is craft beer and comfort food - makes for a great lunch!There is a craft beer menu, and the beers come in three sizes. Â If you&#39;re unsure of what to order, they will give you a tasting of the beer which was super nice because I have very little knowledge of beer outside my comfort zone.I ordered a patty melt with tater tots - it was a good size, very tasty and not at all greasy as patty melts can be.

Cutesy old house with teas and sandwiches? Nay. Hidden dive-gem of the western suburbs. How can a beer and bar-food enthusiast not totally dig this place?Beer menu = really good. Lots of stuff you can find in most decent beer bars, but a good selection of the finer craft brews. They had Scurry by Off Color Brewing on nitro, which tasted excellent. They also had some brews from Solemn Oath, Deschutes, Lagunitas, Left Hand, Stone, and Three Floyds on draft. There were other good selections available in bottles/cans, like Founders, Oskar Blues, Revolution, Great Lakes, Church Street, and Two Bros. Good to see they support local brews! They had a tap for Penrose hanging on the ceiling, and that place isn&#39;t even open yet (soon to be in Geneva, I believe).Anyway, beer was good, right? No Miller Lites or lawnmower beers. Lots of whiskey and bourbon to choose from, and a couple ciders available (not Woodchuck). I think that any craft beer lover would be happy. ALSO, you can get a 6oz beer, if you want to try a few beers instead of drinking one or two large pints. It&#39;s a nice option, if you aren&#39;t sure what you want a lot of, or if you just are in the variety sort of mood.Food, woah. They have a grilled cheese with CHEESE on the OUTSIDE. It&#39;s crisped on the outside of the bread, so don&#39;t expect something oozy-gooey on the outside, but don&#39;t be dismayed. It&#39;s really good and flavorful. We added grilled mushrooms, grilled onions, tomato, and bacon. This thing was overflowing but not gross or messy. Lots of flavor without an obscene amount of cheese. We split that, and then also split the Patty Melt. It was fairly standard...homemade burger patty on toasted, marbled rye, swiss, and grilled onions. The burger was a bit more than medium, but it was juicy, so no complaints. If I had to pick a winner, I&#39;d vote for the grilled cheese, but I&#39;m not sorry I ordered the patty melt.THOSE FRIES THOUGH. They look like boring-@ss fries, but don&#39;t be fooled. My husband ordered sweet potato tots and was a sorry sucka. He didn&#39;t finish his tots and was picking from my pile of carby, salty french fries. Not too thick, not too thin, with a crunchy outside and fluffy inside. Fried to perfection, and you get a lot. Yummmmm.Cory behind the bar was friendly and knowledgable. Everything was prompt and he checked back on us frequently. He even asked &#34;Does everything taste great?&#34; assuming that the found was excellent (which it was). Glad to see this place and its quality inspires confidence in its employees.I&#39;ll be back here. There are other items on the menu that I NEED to try, plus they have rotating specials, like spaghetti, ribs, tacos, etc. Their beer menu is rotating, and its nice to see that they have it posted on their website.

Why you ask? 3 reasons: 1) hard to leave for less than $25 even if you&#39;re just having beers, 2) the food is ordinary, and not many options for vegetarians, and 3) the most important, they have one of the all time rudest servers, yet she is there ALL the time.

My preference is a beer that I&#39;ve had before, I don&#39;t get they whole sport of craft beers....too many to choose from.Now the food, we started with the chicken tortilla soup....fair at best. Then the main course was their Sat. night special, ribs. I have to say the were the worse I&#39;ve ever had. Almost reminded me of the rib meat on the Mcrib sandwich at McDonald&#39;s.

The food selection is amazing, especially rib nights on Saturdays and the sweet potato tater tots. The menu covers everything from fish and chips to pulled chicken to monster salads.But what really got me hooked was the beer selection. I signed up for their text notification club, and get a text whenever a new beer is tapped. Most of my visits were because of those texts. Their beer selection is mix of local mainstay (3 Floyds, Revolution, Two Brothers) and some from the outer reaches of the galaxy (Portland, generally). There is a variety of sizes, so you don&#39;t have to break the bank to try something new.There are a few downsides. The inside is kind of cramped and dark. There is a good amount of seating, but if you&#39;re waiting for a table on a busy night, there&#39;s nowhere to stand that&#39;s out of the way. I always had to do the shuffle dance with incoming guests. This also means the wait can get kind of long, but a good beer is an easy remedy. Downsides, yes.

Â I don&#39;t think you should go there to eat, though - I think you should go there to enjoy fantastic beverages. Â Because nobody should drink bad beer, IMO.Belly up to the bar or, if it&#39;s nice outside, go and sit at one of the tables on the little patio. Â This is not a large place - it might be kind of crowded. Â Either way, you will find a fairly random, and yet fantastic, assortment of beers. Â It&#39;s not exactly what one would expect for the looks of the place or the location. Â Keep in mind, at least from yesterday to today, the beer menu on the website is only a portion of what they had in last night. Â It seems like a place to go to see what is new and interesting, which is a good thing in my book. Â I mean who else has bottles of the Game of Thrones beer?I also like that you can get a sample size, a slightly larger size or a regular-sized pour of beer. Â I like to try all the things so it&#39;s nice to be able to try a lot of different tastes without being stuck with something I don&#39;t like.Decent service and the bartender was both funny and had really good recommendations.

They added hat/coat/purse hooks at your bar seats that are very convenient. Also, beers are now served in 8, 11.5 and 14 oz glasses of your choice, unless it is a strong ale.I was in the Gammon Coach House the first day it opened. Â They offer craft beer &amp; comfort food. Â I go to a bar for craft beer on tap. Â I have plenty of bottles at home (many I have brewed myself).This place is a circa 1886 building behind a large Victorian mansion at the corner of Wilson and Batavia Ave. Â Walking in, there is a vestibule to keep the winter cold out that pushes into the room. Â The small 6-seat bar is 2 steps from the door. To the right is a nook of 2 bar height tables; to the left there are 3 bar height tables. The bar only seats 6. Â There are 24 seats in this room and a back room that seats about 24. Â GCH also has seating for 30 on a patio. Â There is 1 TV for all to see Â in the front room, and 1 in the back room. Â There is sports on TV, no sound, with music playing (they put the Sox on at my request). Â My favorite seat at any pub is at the corner or short side of the bar. Â This place only has a straight bar, the short side has a garbage can and a stack of glasses and servers work from that end. Â They could use a bigger bar, but space is limited.The room has a lot of wood. The floor has a wood look, the north wall looks to be the original wood plank wall with single pane grid windows, The ceiling is wood plank. Â It feels warm and cozy. The only problem is there is an opening to the kitchen with bright lights from the kitchen shining into this warm room, the cooks radio can be heard, and the cooks repeated yelling &#34;burger up&#34;. Â They need a better method to notify food is ready, and doors to block off the kitchen&#39;s intrusion into the bar atmosphere.OK, Brad is the beer tender. He is very knowledgeable regarding craft beer and seems to be able to discuss any brewery in the country. I later learned he is a brew master. Â They have 12 taps, but 2-4 are wasted on tasteless beers. They do have a very nice selection of brews in the remaining 8 taps. Â Beers are sold in the standard 11.5 oz glass for around $4.80. Â Now, the usual 14 oz glasses limit me to 2 beers to be legal to drive. Â You could enjoy a variety 3 of these ales at a relaxed pace, and drive under the limit. They have a minimalist, but satisfying menu of build your own burger, build your own thin crust pizza, chill, wings and things. Â I tried a burger and it was satisfying, Â I ordered medium and it was medium, not bloody. Fries are good too. not too skinny, not to fat; slightly crispy on the outside with patatoey flavor inside.Over all, the place is great!

Â The place is super quaint and has really good, positive energy.The main attraction here is the beer. Â They have 12 highly unusual taps running, stuff I have not seen since the Wheaton Ale Fest.

Â My husband stumbled onto this place (thanks, Yelp), in an attempt to find a decent Friday fish fry (thank you, Lent). Â He decided that we should give it a try solely based on 1.) finding it decently reviewed on Yelp and 2.) the photos of the food on their website. Â I can&#39;t stress how small this place is, but then again, when you&#39;re called &#34;coach house,&#34; I guess you can&#39;t expect much bigger than a shoebox. Â The atmosphere is quite charming, very pub-like. Â There are a few tables in the front &amp; a small separate dining area in the back as well as a bar with a handful of barstools. Â The beer menu is extensive, filled with interesting sounding craft beers, and the food menu is simple and straightforward. Â I appreciate that. Â The fish fry was excellent, and what&#39;s more, I was able to order tater tots instead of fries (oooooh yes). Â For $11, I got 3 fat pieces of battered cod, and mound of tater tots, and a heap of pretty tasty cole slaw. Â I&#39;m not a huge fan of slaw, especially when it&#39;s mayo-based, but this stuff was fresh and pretty tasty. Â The service was a bit slow, but it was a Friday night, and there were only 2 servers.

Â I&#39;ve been here a number of times since they first opened but always fairly late to meet up with friends for a beer or 2. Â The draft list has been 90% different on each visit. Â While I have had 80% of the beers previously that they had offered (I am a beer nerd), most I have never seen on tap. Â While most would not be considered trending ultra-hot beer nerd brews, it is always a fantastic, well though out lineup of difficult to find beers. Â Their bottle list I think could step up a notch in their offerings. Â They could also benefit by offering a couple high-end large format beers on the menu (last visit they did have Goose Island Kind Edward and Bourbon County Coffee Stout which is a good step in the right direction).My last visit I was there for dinner which was an interesting change of pace for seeing how they operate as a restaurant. Â The place is pretty small and littered with vintage farmhouse tables and chairs which can be a tight fit but definitely cozy to sit at. Â When the evening gets later and the drinking crowd comes out, these tables are quite a hindrance. Â The scene during dinner was definitely all families dining with their adult &#34;children&#34;.The food is comfort food and quite good. Â The chips and salsa are homemade and were devoured instantly. Â The grill cheese was more than your average offering with cheese that was also slapped to the outside and charred = delicious. Â The patty melt was advertised to include grilled onions which werent delivered, it was non-the-less great. Â I paired it with Greenbush&#39;s Retribution which is an offering you won&#39;t find elsewhere and a perfect match.The odd: all beers are offered in 2 or 3 different sizes (with large being a pint glass) with prices like 4.35 and 5.15 which its nice to see them conscientious on their offering price, its a bit of a head scratcher in the bar world.This is a place I will continue to frequent often."gammon-coach-house-batavia,Brian L.,WZq0FC-0HS6_R4pKUy_3Ig,"North Aurora, IL",0,1,0,38,3,9E5PdCTswQKY1x9lJ6usxQ,4,25/01/12,"Just like Robb C, I hadn&#39;t heard of this place until I saw it on Yelp!

Â Really glad we did. Â The extensive beer selection also rotates micro/custom brews and if you sign up for their text message service you&#39;ll get notification when new ones are coming in or when special brews are going to make their appearance.We started with the mini-calzones appetizer and they were pretty good. Â Only complaint was that the red sauce that comes with it was cold and could have been warmed a little.I had a burger with pepper jack, bacon and a fried egg. Â It was made to order (medium rare).

The couple of times I have been there, the tap list has been interesting, and is what keeps drawing me back.The biggest fault of the Gammon Coach House is the service. Its hit or miss, and has been mostly miss for me. Many times the server will dissapear for quite awhile while our beer glasses sit empty, or at one point after ordering our beer from our waitress, we saw it sitting on the end of the bar for at least 10 min. before it finally found its way to us. I don&#39;t think I can take any friends here since the service is embarrassing.The food isn&#39;t bad - but I wish they would expand their menu. The grilled cheese has been quite good the number of times I&#39;ve tried it (and the order was correct). The pulled pork is nothing to write home about - but again I&#39;d like to see a bit more variety on the menu.UPDATE 1-3-14: I&#39;ve visited Gammon a number of times since my initial review and things have gotten much better there. The beer selection has been wonderful each time, and I think the service has improved quite a bit as well.

Â But worst of all, I was there one night when a mentally challenged individual came in. Â One of the tables started harassing and belittling the individual.

Â Now I&#39;m lucky enough to live in the Great Lakes region where we have equally as good craft brews just not quite as many options. Â BUT thanks to The Gammon Coach House I can experience all my favorites and try some new ones without having to leave my hometown of Batavia. Â It&#39;s true good to be true but yes...Batavia finally has a pub worth raving about. Â GCH is a nice spot to enjoy high quality craft brew with a solid pub menu. Â They just opened so I think they are still working out some kinks but overall they&#39;re on the right track. Â I&#39;ve visited GCH about 5 times now and continue to enjoy the experience. Â The food menu is a bit limited but the if you&#39;re in the mood for a quality burger or flat bread pizza then you&#39;ll be fine. Â The burgers are better here than at the rival Geneva Ale House! Â They also have sweet potato tater tots which are way better than their cousin the sweet potato fries. Â They serve 10 beers on tap (sometimes they may be out of one or two of the hot sellers) and a host of bottles. Â They could probably expand the bottle selection a bit but I prefer draft beer so I don&#39;t really mind. Â They have two LCD TV&#39;s where you&#39;ll find a prime time football or baseball game on but watching sports isn&#39;t the main attraction here. Â Save that for Buffalo Wild Wings. Â Their patio is pretty big but with only a handful of nice days left in the year you better enjoy it while it lasts. Â The service is pretty good but it&#39;s getting better. Â The two girls behind the bar, Melmo and Nora, are great.The one think I&#39;d like to see is some drink options for kids. Â Maybe some apple juice, lemonade, milk and a plastic cup option. Â I&#39;m not suggesting they go over board with a full kids menu option or anything but it would be nice to have an alternative to glassware and the orange juice and water they serve to kids today. Â I&#39;ll be watching to see if they change this up. Â If they don&#39;t then I&#39;ll have to assume they&#39;re intentionally not catering to kids which would be sad because Batavia is a family oriented town. Â I&#39;d hate to have to limit my business because I couldn&#39;t have my 6 year old join me for a burger and some tater tots!I really hope they continue with the quality beer and food selection I&#39;ve seen so far.

However, I think they have some kinks to work out...We visited on a Friday night to try the fish. We sat outside on the cute little patio out front. So far so good. The menu is not extensive, but we were just there to try the fish, so it didn&#39;t really matter. I decided to try the baked cod instead of the traditional fried variety, as I was trying to be good. The waitress came by to take our drink orders and explained that did not have baked cod that night - instead there was a tilapia dish with mushroom polenta. Ok, no big deal. I decide to go with the fried fish. One of my companions tried to order a non-alcoholic beer, which they do not have. Oops. I asked for a kids menu for my four year old, and the waitress explained that they don&#39;t have one. She said most kids just order the pizza or hot dog from the regular menu. We decided on the macaroni and cheese for him (side order - $4). I hate paying for macaroni and cheese since it&#39;s so cheap to make at home, especially when doesn&#39;t come with anything else, but I digress...The food came out fairly quickly, and everything was nice and hot. The fish itself was good, but the batter was super thick, and reminded us of a corn dog. The fries were good, but the coleslaw looked like it was made quite a while ago. It was starting to brown, and the carrots on top looked dry. I asked the waitress (very nicely) if there was any fresh coleslaw, and she told me it&#39;s a vinegar coleslaw and not a creamy one, and that it had been refrigerated (basically telling me I was wrong to think there was anything wrong with it). Um, ok. She said she could bring me another one, but at that point I just decided to skip it altogether. At the end of our meal, we all had piles of breading on our plates and no one had touched the coleslaw.One final experience that sort of capped off the evening. I believe there are apartments or offices of some sort above the restaurant. While we were sitting on the patio, someone came out of a door that opens right onto the patio with a bag of garbage. I&#39;m pretty sure they worked/lived there, and weren&#39;t a restaurant employee, but it&#39;s still kind of gross to have someone carry garbage through a restaurant. Even if it is outside.Perhaps it will do well as a bar, what with the beer selection, but we probably won&#39;t go back for a meal."gammon-coach-house-batavia,Joe H.,a7w1Lx07v6K_YH93zL17Og,"Batavia, IL",0,1,0,3,3,PQtYAiY5y6IXtdW_sRIAMw,2,11/08/12,"Love Love Love this place!

Be sure to add the Turbo crust (free -- garlic + butter + parmesan; they also have other options like Cajun and Poppyseed).This Deep Dish is two little square pizzas, and if you are a crust monster this is the one for you! I want to write love sonnets to it. I don&#39;t understand how in the 10-12 minutes it takes from me placing my order to the pizza being ready that the crust gets so beautifully brown, almost caramelized around the bottom edges.Unlike the Hand Tossed [which we ordered by mistake once, and was okay], the Deep Dish doesn&#39;t really have a top edge; it&#39;s all about that glorious crunchy bottom crust.Also, this is different from Chicago style Deep Dish (which makes me very happy, as I don&#39;t like the concept of having sloppy sauce on the top of my pizza with nothing securing it to everything else). The closest analogs are Buddy&#39;s and Shield&#39;s from Detroit.Regarding this particular location, we were served by a very polite young lady, and the pizza was made quickly, though we dropped in and ordered at the counter.In case you couldn&#39;t tell, I heartily approve of this place.

Mind you I was excited about the move to Naperville, but that excitement was extinguished by my first visit.The hostess greeted us and took us to our table, and on the approach a very rude server runs up and yells at the host &#34;You&#39;re not putting them there! Put them somewhere else!&#34; And the poor stunned hostess didn&#39;t know what to do. She asked the server &#34;Well where should I put them?&#34; To which the unpleasant server replied &#34;I don&#39;t care but not here&#34;So I get it. There&#39;s an eleven top waiting for space, but don&#39;t scream at the hostess in front of the guest. Later when that eleven top got sat they didn&#39;t even end up at that table. So clearly the hostess had things in hand. The server was more concerned with getting the eleven top.So we get sat outside. Not my preference, but the flustered host was trying to recover.Then we sit. And sit. And sit some more. Finally the server comes over. Asks if this is our first time at FIU. WE SAY NO. He proceeds to explain the concept. Okay. Whatever.Next he asks if we want to put in a drink order. I ask what beers are on tap. He says to me &#34;We only have local beers and you probably don&#39;t know what they are...&#34;Excuse me? I can tell you all the local brewers, their regular beers and seasonal beers. Now the server doesn&#39;t know this, but I&#39;m pissed.So I ask well what do you have. He begins rattling off styles of beer &#34;I&#39;ve got two IPAs, a double bock, an American IPA, and a Farmhouse Pale Ale&#34;Well first off it&#39;s a doppelbock. And not all IPAs are the same. So I ask what breweries, and his response ... &#34;I don&#39;t know&#34;So you believe I&#39;m too stupid to know the local beers, and then can&#39;t be bothered to tell me the breweries? Fine. I&#39;ll have the Farmhouse because right now Solemn Oath has Hexafoos, and my guess is that&#39;s what you meant when you said Farmhouse Pale Ale. I hope I&#39;m not too stupid to figure that out.Food comes and it tastes bland. Like I said I&#39;m used to Aurora. I know what the food tastes like. This isn&#39;t it.We eat, and wait forever for the server to come back to get the check. The check shows an IPA.Okay. I give up. I&#39;m too stupid to know the local beers, but you&#39;re too stupid to enter the right beer? Without a doubt I had a Hexafoos.I won&#39;t be going back because of the insulting, arrogant, incompetent staff and the underwhelming food.I also will not be going to Naperville anymore. See my other review as to why I won&#39;t be going there. This place should change their name to FuckItUp Tacos.

I don&#39;t even know where to begin.When I first saw the menu, I was excited about having pablano Â gauc -I&#39;m a vegetarian, so avocados and pablanos are two of my absolutely favorite things. I then read some reviews, and I saw a few people say how the menu was too simple, or rather, every taco tasted the same, with a big dependency on the alioi. I&#39;ve make alioi myself and have always enjoyed it, so I thought it might be a fun adventure. I also read about the Parmesan chips, and how they tasted stale. Again, I was up for trying something new.When we arrived, at 5:30 on a Friday, the place was filled. The host was very nice and asked if we wanted to wait for a table or eat at the bar. We said we&#39;d wait at the bar for a table. The place had a nice vibe, the Â bartender was very friendly. In all, it seemed nice.We were told we&#39;d have to wait 45 minutes, and we only Â had to wait 10. Again, nice.Then we got our gauc and chips. I make guac at least once a week. Fresh gauc isn&#39;t watery, it has chunks in it. It isn&#39;t Â a paste. This was...like store bought gauc. Making matters worse, it had a level of spice and heat to it, but it didn&#39;t taste anything like a pablano. Â Hubby immediately said, your guac is a million times better. It needed pablano flavor and salt..and actual avocado. Â The chips? Â What are they thinking. They are soggy and stale tasting. Seriously. Not our thing at all.We then got our tacos. They looked good. I had a pablano and a veggie. Hubby had a poor boy and a gringo. We also split a beans and rice. The beans and rice were the only truly interesting part of dinner and they were oily. It was basmati rice with a lot of cumin and beans. It Â reminded hubby of a curry of sorts. Â The tacos? Both of mine tasted the same. They were the same, save for the one having cabbage and the other having mushrooms. Â Hubby kind of enjoyed his gringo, but he couldn&#39;t eat his poor boy. Â he said we make better tacos at home (lamb carnitas Â being a favorite of his).We finally decided that it was nice to try something new, but we wished we went to Â Bien Truche or its sister restaurant.

I hope that someday that makes it onto the menu because DAMN that would be good. Those are totally my two favorite tacos here and you know what they say about two great tastes that taste great together...no, wait, that was peanut butter and chocolate or something muddled in my 80s-brain.Here&#39;s what&#39;s great about the new Wheaton Fire It Up location. I mean, in addition to the already awesome food. There&#39;s more space than the Naperville location so you don&#39;t have as long of a wait.Last night, my wife and I stopped by for some pre-Thanksgiving Taco Tuesday grubbin&#39; and left full and happy after indulging in a couple of cocktails, the parmesan chips and guac, and a round of tacos.Our waiter was super friendly, and tho I don&#39;t often use the phrase &#34;chill&#34; he was super chill. We had a slight speed bump in the fact that our chips were stale when they arrived. We were so hungry that we ate almost all of them anyway before I had a chance to mention they were stale, but when I did he brought us an entire fresh order complete with more guac. After that, you know we were feelin&#39; guacy. (I need you guys to embrace that as a phrase. K thnx).The tacos were just as awesome as Naperthrill, and we stuffed ourselves on shrimp, pork, cheeseburger and gringo. All delicious. All prepared fresh and done extremely well.I&#39;m not sure if we&#39;ll return to this location based on distance from our house, but the size of the place definitely has something going for it and it&#39;s absolutely just as great as their other location. I hope FIU continues expanding and perhaps will open a location in my backyard someday.No wait...that might be bad."fire-it-up-wheaton,Aimee M.,RO3vznPVVw5NWcgfP3k17A,"Chicago, IL",1,1,1,365,454,fR7nx-D5Os27N2kGgN6b2g,5,21/05/16,"I was looking for some quick eats and found FIU as great place for that on an early Saturday evening. I had been to the Naperville location a few years back and didn&#39;t really find it that great, so I was hoping a different location might be a better experience.Had a seat at the bar and the server was great. I couldn&#39;t decide on what to order so I went with my servers suggestion and enjoyed my order.The Chophouse taco (steak, Portobello, onion, cabbage and the house spicy sauce) and the Shrimp taco (shrimp, cabbage, lemon aioli). Â Both were very flavorful, using fresh ingredients and cooked well. Â I loved the bit of spice in the Chophouse and added a bit more with the sauces provided.I wish there was more of a craft beer/cocktail menu, but I liked that the craft beer they did have were from local breweries."fire-it-up-wheaton,Tim H.,zCASNH25GTirvxqtmzuVVw,"Naperville, IL",0,1,1,209,53,pkP9yj9_vjWZlPNFXs57gA,4,06/05/16,"At last... patio dining at its finest.

Each taco was served on a flour tortilla and came with coleslaw on it.The chophouse was actually our least favorite. It had a spicy sauce on it and mushrooms. But compared to the others it was just not as good.The shrimp was our favorite. The shrimp were extremely fresh and had a great flavor.The bbq pork was also amazing. The pork was juicy and full of flavor and the combination with the coleslaw and flour tortilla worked well.The steak taco was good as well. More along the lines of a classic steak taco.

The Naperville location is 5-star amazing and I was pumped to find a location closer to home. I ordered my usual order from the Naperville location: chips and guac, a gringo taco, a cheeseburger taco, and a BLT taco. The chips, the amazing incredible delicious Parmesan dusted chips I am OBSESSED with at the Naperville location, were... Off. They were so greasy that they weren&#39;t crunchy, but almost chewy. They were bendable. They were still parm dusted, but there was a ton of parm at the bottom of the dish, too. The guac was brownish at the edges of the container. The gringo taco was just so greasy it was almost inedible. Even the BLT taco was greasy from the single strip of bacon on it.Typically I would say this is my own fault for getting takeout, but I get takeout at the other location, further from my house, and it arrives perfect, consistently. I guess this is what i get for Â choosing convenience over reliability.

Â There is literally a mini-salad on each one. Â This isn&#39;t necessarily a terrible thing, and I get it - it&#39;s a cheap and healthy way to add bulk and make it look like you&#39;re getting a lot of bang for your buck. Â But there&#39;s really no variation from taco to taco. Â The same mixed greens - everywhere, in abundant qualities. Â This makes it difficult to savor the really high quality, locally sourced meats that they&#39;re using. Â The steak they used was tender and well-seasoned, but it was hard to realize that with a mouth full of lettuce.We tried six different tacos, and overall they were pretty decent. Â The least successful were the shrimp (overcooked and rubbery), the veggie (mostly just rice with a hearty helping of the aforementioned greens; not very exciting) and the BBQ pork (sauce was a little too sweet and there was a little too much of it). Â The steak was great, though - and the sauce on the southwest chicken was amazing.Chips were good, salsa was good.... sangria was delicious and the margaritas are strong.As far as service goes - our waitress was attentive but not obnoxiously so. Â The stool seating is not very comfortable, but since this isn&#39;t really a place that you&#39;re going to linger for a long time, I guess that&#39;s okay.

We came around 7pm on a Wednesday &amp; weren&#39;t greeted promptly.

OK...but can we sit down?! (we won&#39;t order food for awhile if the chefs need a little more time)...... She then seats us.We order a few drinks, some sangria &amp; a couple on-tap beers. (nothing wrong here, the drinks were good).Then, about 15 mins later we each order about 3 tacos each. Which, as I&#39;d like to mention..none of them really appealed to us. It seems all of the tacos on the menu have mayo..or aioli or some other sauce they are drenched in. I understand this is a &#39;fusion&#39; restaurant but the menu lacks restraint. That&#39;s already a red flag.Fast forward 50 minutes...YES 50... We finally get our tacos.I can handle a long wait on food if it&#39;s worth it but these tacos...were AWFUL. The flour tortilla&#39;s they serve are not homemade &amp; pretty bad quality to start. They really skimp on the actual meats- and add a lot of fillers like lettuce &amp; sauces.

It&#39;s because the salt is meant to be tasted with each sip without having to shove your fingers into the glass to pick up the lime and lick it.The tacos are actually decent, but not outstanding. The Cheeseburger taco is an actual cheeseburger in a flour tortilla. The Gringo has a (very) deep fried flour tortilla and it&#39;s pretty good.Summary: If you&#39;re a foodie expecting something like Big Star, stay away. If you&#39;re a person with more simple tastes, give it a try. If the chips weren&#39;t so awful I&#39;d rate this place a 3.5."fire-it-up-wheaton,David C.,o2nfXkDO2VQAL6I45GZZ2A,"Winfield, IL",0,1,0,2,33,#NAME?,2,08/07/16,"Excellent chips, very light and flaky.

Today, I chose Fire It Up.The service was great and tacos were good.This is a quaint little place that locally sources, including their beer. I ordered the following:Half Acre Pony Pilsner - this was a nice local beer, lighter, yummy.Chips and Guac - the Guac was fresh and tasty. The chips were Parmesan dusted. They were ok, kind of bland.2 tacos- Taco Tuesday! I order one with Bbq pork. Good flavor, sweet &amp; crispy from the cabbage. The second, steak &amp; mushroom with a little bite. Both had a nice mix of taste and texture, filling.Lastly, the music was spot on with my taste. Started with 311 (love them!), Incubus, Weezer, the Gorillaz, Beck, RHCP, etc. good music is always a win for me.Try them out!

I came in with my wife and two small children and it is very frustrating to see the same size group sit down at the same time as us and they get drinks and appetizers before we even got our drinks.That being said, these are quite possibly the best tacos I&#39;ve ever had. Not traditional, that&#39;s for sure but everything is pumped so full of flavor. They marinate everything and every taco has their own special sauce. I realized halfway through my three tacos that I haven&#39;t even been putting the awesome homemade hot sauce on them!They also have a great beer selection ND the chimichanga desert is to die for.Definitely recommend checking this place out."fire-it-up-wheaton,Bob B.,OHE0cCYmoJf9OXs7EFZWPg,"Wheaton, IL",0,1,0,0,10,0v8MHoYJs4tfh3aCyqF7AQ,5,22/02/16,"Went in on a Saturday @11:45am and were sat right away.

The ambiance is wonderful, especially the surprising outdoor seating area which is not expected when viewd from the entrance; in fact the venue appeared &#39;closed&#39; when our family pulled up.It was a warm late August Saturday evening and we had our choice of &#39;in or out&#39;. The inside appears clean and inviting and with a nice atmosphere but we chose &#39;out&#39; and it reminded us of some of our old Lincoln Park haunts; A very inviting patio. The kids liked it too. (Be warned to bring mosquito spray though).The service was prompt and friendly, they explained the &#39;origin story&#39; and their food quality. Waitperson recommended items and alerted us to the portion size.We did the chips and guacamole; I also asked for salsa as well. The chips were OK...1/2 were crispy and Â 1/2 were chewy...not sure which it was supposed to be! I like em crispy.The guac was great.The salsa was so so though my wife liked it. To me it tasted sort of relishy and was a paste like consistency.My son got the pulled pork taco and enjoyed it. My wife got the steak and Portobello mushroom tacos and like them. I ordered &#39;The Truck&#39;; their burrito w/ steak, chicken and shrimp. The waitperson recommended I get the shrimp on the side after I mentioned that did not sound like a good combo.I did. The burrito was a solid &#39;good&#39;. Â My wife had the lemonade (really good) and I had the margarita...so so again because the taste was a little sweet and the salt was &#39;on the lime&#39;. I had not realized what &#39;salt on the lime&#39; meant, it meant they placed the salt on the lime in your drink...duh)It may be picky but I think salt &#39;on the rim&#39; is a standard that makes it easier for those of us who like salt margaritas to actually make it easier to taste a little salt w/ each sip instead of pulling out a lime to lick it! Â At $8 it as just OK.All in all it was a pleasant experience but it lacked something important: It did not seem to me to taste like the expected Mexican fair; more new age Wheaton Mexican. I appreciate organic/locally sourced/etc. but want some Mexican tastiness too.Another gripe: Paying 5-7 bucks for chips and salsa/guac is a deal breaker for me. 99.999% of Mexican restaurants provide immediate gratis chips and salsa to their customers. A table of 4 goes through them like crazy and at that price there should have at least been a refill or two of the chips to make it worthwhile.Sooo; while I can see that they run a good establishment I would not return due to my reservations stated above though I encourage anyone to give it a try...my wife and kids like their fair...I thought it was OK. Obviously others seem to like that taste of this version of &#39;Mexican&#39; cooking."fire-it-up-wheaton,Christina L.,RkiCtCLeeyZPy4FO2rQKeA,"Greenville, NC",0,1,0,0,53,qfE4RI9yCbpTV-h-Vc0lBg,3,07/08/16,Fernando was our waiter and was great.

We moved to another table further away from the music. When our waiter, William, came with our drinks, he mentioned that we had moved so we told him why. He replied &#34; We&#39;re a rockin place. My mother likes it.&#34; He then walks away without taking our orders. Two noisy freight trains had passed (the restaurant backs up to the train station) before he ambled over to take our order. The food was just ok. My husband had asked for corn tortillas but got flour. I wanted to ask for lemons for my fresh lemonade because it had little flavor, but William was nowhere in sight. When we were finished and ready to leave he came and offered more lemonade and we asked for the check instead. When we had the check and looked at the total we handed him our charge card. He went off printed customer and restaurant tabs, gave them to us and left. My daughter noticed that the top receipt didn&#39;t match the total on the other receipts. William didn&#39;t appear again (there were only 3 tables outside and 1 inside that were occupied). We went in to the bar and asked who was in charge and the gentleman there said that he was. He assured us that it wasn&#39;t a scam and recharged us the correct amount for our meal, while supposedly deleting the incorrect charge. 3 days later I have been charged the correct bill total but still have the incorrect charge as a hold on my credit card. I told the friend who had recommended Fire it Up to us and was told that a very similar problem had occurred there with his son and date. I resent that I have a hold on my account and that I have to spend time monitoring the situation until it is taken care of properly.

One thing that really stood out for me was the amazing calamari appetizer. Best I have had in many years; large portion, fresh, fried to perfection and a tasty red sauce.Overall, the mains were above average with the exception of the pizza. The pizza was on special for $5, and that is what we got,, an uninspired flop of dough, undercooked... Reminded me of Little Ceasar&#39;s.

I had the left overs the next day.. yummy!My son had the Â Rigatoni alla Paesana.. very good as well. The sausage was really good.I was going lite and had the Ceasar Salad which was very fresh and tasty. I also had the Cream of Crab soup.. which was okay, but had very little crab meat if any...Overall, the service was above average. Our wait person was very busy with some large tables, but the bus staff picked up the slack. When we sat down, they brought hot bread. I could have made a meal of that, olive oil and shredded parmesan cheese provided. Â Super yummy! Drinks were refilled and plates picked up in a timely manner as the courses progressed.We all had dessert. The termisso was very good.

Dishes are great and services were decent.However, I was a bit unhappy that we didn&#39;t get to stay in the party room which I didn&#39;t really understand the reason. I made a reservation for the party room for 10 of us a week ago. A lady took my reservation and happily told me I was all set and there is no minimal expense required.4 hours before my reservation time, I got a call from the restaurant and asked me to call back to confirm my reservation which I did right away. I called back and was told Party room is not available and we are moved to a separate area which I thought it is a separate room. I told him we have 10 ladies who could be very loud when we are excited to see each other. He said no worries.A couple of my girlfriends got there before me. Â We were moved to a big table next to a few small tables. After we sat down, they told me they heard from the host that we were booted from the party room because we didn&#39;t pay the minimal deposit for the party room. I would be happy to pay the fee if there was someone told me when I called. I felt like someone lied to me. It is OK to ask us to move to a table if there is someone really needed the party room. I&#39;d understand. But if you told me there is NO minimum expense needed when I make the reservation, you&#39;d better to stick to your word. Not give the party room out to someone who made the reservation after me. This is not right.I didn&#39;t want to ruin the night for the girls who have not seen each other for a few months. We still chatted and enjoyed dinner. Both Tilapia and Halibut fish were delicious. Pastas were a little bit off. Our server was awesome.

The pinot noir (me) and old fashioned (the hubbs) were delicious. Our waitress was spot-on. The sausage risotto was addicting - I wanted more! She said we could add a protein to it and have as an entree. I will definitely do that next time instead. The hubbs said the gnocchi was heavy but very delicious. The sauce was tasty like Alfredo. I wish restaurants paired heavy meals with small salads to change the palate in between bites.CONS:My chicken with zucchini was annoyingly salty. Four stars for this reason. I could not eat the veggies, and I&#39;m a veggie fanatic. The goat cheese is the only thing that helped me finish the chicken. I think the price did not reflect the quality and presentation of the food. My chicken with zucchini cost $19, but it looked and tasted like a $15 dinner.Also, the bathrooms were dirty. As a general former manager myself, I analyze all bathrooms, as I feel they are a direct relationship as to how much detail the management focuses on the establishment.

So, take this review with a grain of salt. Nonetheless, here it is.The restaurant gets big bonus stars for having a very large and nicely presented gluten-free menu. And they had that holy grail of items: the gluten-free pizza!BUT...I ordered one with sausage, artichoke, eggplant, and black olives. Â As shown in the pictures below, upon arrival there was very little in the way of sausage toppings. As a matter of fact, there were only seven pieces of sausage for the eight slices of pizza! Â One slice would have to be naked.Also, it really wasn&#39;t very warm. Â I described it as the temperature of a cracker that had sat in a beam of sunshine.However, as any good user of yelp knows, let the Â restaurant try to fix any problems!In this instance, the waitress gladly retrieved the pizza to warm it up. And she had the kitchen put a substantial quantity of sausage on the pizza. Â Please refer to the before and after pictures with this review. The before picture is the way this restaurant served the pizza, which is with very little topping. Â And the after picture is in my view the correct way the pizza should&#39;ve been served from the start-- with lots of topping. Â so, while your mileage may vary, my experience was the originally served version of the pizza was laughably free of the toppings, but the corrected version was, well, corrected in terms of sausage. Â The temperature at the pizza was better, but still far from steaming.I might give it a second chance, and try something else off their gluten-free menu, and while I&#39;m there see if other pizzas look topped."francescas-at-the-promenade-bolingbrook,George V.,xMb9__p6q0fOs-egfkh_Yg,"Skokie, IL",0,1,0,5,1,ujKr-MSk7K8Zh3vN3sUlcA,3,11/11/15,"Food gets two stars, service gets zero stars, averaging out to one star.The food here is OK; fairly standard fare for any mall italian place.

Â (I didn&#39;t have high hopes going in.) Â The sauce was pleasant if a bit uninspired. Â Ordered the carrot cake for desert and was pretty sure it was just unboxed Sysco; completely tasteless except for the frosting.Where this place falls flat on its face is in the service department. Â It takes a heck of a lot to break my 15% tipping floor, but this place tunneled through that floor like there was a gold nugget underneath it. Â We saw our waiter exactly THREE TIMES during the entire meal -- once to give us menus, once to take our order, and once to drop off the check. Â That was it! Â We had to flag down a busboy to get drinks, had to flag down a different busboy to get bread, flag down another busboy to get water, you get the idea. Â Eventually tipped 1% on a $100 check and wrote YOU SUCK in large letters next to the tip line.Even worse, management doesn&#39;t care. Â Typically if you&#39;re in a restaurant the GM will at least swing by and check if everything is going OK, not at Francesca&#39;s!

Â Fittingly, once our meal was over he apparently fell in a hole; we asked for the GM to complain about the atrocious service and nobody could find him!

However, our waiter did forget about our appetizer (the Bruschetta con Prosciutto, which was ok. Big pieces of bread with a few tomatoes and a small piece of prosciutto). And they ended up bringing it out with our dinner, which was a tad odd, but they did take it off the bill so I can&#39;t complain too much there.And I ordered the $24 (forgot the name) jumbo shrimp with spicy tomato sauce (not spicy) on linguini. It also had black olives and capers (a few to many in my opinion but it did add a nice flavor). It was an alright meal. I wasn&#39;t impressed with it and won&#39;t order it again for $24. Maybe for 18-20 dollars I would.The only other thing that was a little odd was that 90s Rock was playing on the radio.

The complaints were not near enough seafood toppings on her mixed seafood pasta, spinach was supposed to be in another pasta dish but used something else , rendering it very bitter! My friend and I ordered the shrimp pasta etc. Which was absolutely as bland and dry as can be, had only 4 medium shrimp and the pasta was much more, &#34;el dente&#34; than it should have been. None of us took our leftovers home as it wasn&#39;t worth the calories to eat something so mediocre.It was half price martini night, but when the bill arrived the martinis were billed as full price.Talked to the manager and truly hated complaining about everything, but he was very gracious and kept on saying the chef had to know to get better.

Not appetizing.Maybe I would have been a little more forgiving if I hadn&#39;t spotted the waitress sitting in the party room (there&#39;s glass walls to the room and you have to walk by it to get to the bathrooms) playing on her phone while our table sat serviceless.Maybe I would have been a little more forgiving if the food was better, but I had better pesto the night before from a pre-made mix from Marianos. Oh, and my linguine that the menu boasted was sauteed with shrimp and scallops? Yeah, there were three shrimp and three scallops. The rest of the dish consisted of bland pesto and potatoes, which were way too heavy and should have been left out of a summer pasta dish.

Yes....We were greeted by this sincere cheerful waitress, her name is Olivia....She was taking Â her time, explaining their menu, drinks, knowing its our first time...Cool thing about this restaurant is they change their menu every 2 weeks..I definitely dig that...For appetizer...we got their mussels... Let me tell u... It&#39;s to die for.... The sauce was just soooo refreshing, sweet and spicy at the same time.... Yummy... We know the mussel is fresh coz it so soft and juicy...My bf ordered Â a fish dish (29.99)... Which was really flavorful and melt in your mouth kinda dish...I ordered half a seafood pasta dish...

I was updating my facebook.... Checked in at Francesca&#39;s in bollingbrook.... And francesca&#39;s was giving away desserts for cutomers checked in....I was like... Heck yeah, thats what I&#39;m talking about....So I ordered this chocolate dessert... Sorry, I didn&#39;t get the name... But it was truly delectable.....Price was definitely reasonable for a nice sit down restaurant.....Now mind u, my bf is half Italian and half African American... Yes... He is gorgeous and hott, ANYWAYS, aside from being italian... He went to cooking school.... So he is a good cook....

In fact I&#39;ve given it 3 tries just hoping that I hit them on an off day. Unfortunately the tacos were always extremely bland. The steak in the steak tacos had absolutely no flavor and was very dry, the shrimp tacos and fish tacos were also bland. Â If your going to charge top dollar prices for tacos, almost $5 for (1) shrimp taco, then they had better be off the hook good. I&#39;ve literally had less bland better tasting tacos at hospital cafeterias.Also this is a fast food joint not a full service restaurant so why is there almost a near mandatory tip when you place your order and pay PRIOR TO GETTING YOUR FOOD??? Â Tips should be based on service and not charged upfront. Â Considering that I order and then go get my food at the counter why does the cashier deserve 10%, 15% or 20% tip??? Â And a tip upfront? Â So they know when they are making your food that you didn&#39;t tip or how much your tip was? Â Ridiculous. I am sorry but you do not deserve a $6 tip on a $30 order that took you 60 seconds to complete. Â And with the prices they charge the owners should be able to pay their 2 staff that work their EXTREMELY well.I hate to be blunt but, this place will not last in Elmhurst unless they change things up pretty quickly.

Additionally they don&#39;t have any rice (an oddity for a typical taco place) and the beans were more like a watery soup.

Boyfriend and I ordered the following:Tinga Taco (Shredded chicken): 5/5 my personal favorite of the day; chicken was perfectly flavored and juicy (yet not too juicy where it broke through the homemade shells).Steak Taco: 4/5 they grill the steak whole and then slice it to order, which I prefer because it seems to be more juicy this way. Also Had a great grill flavor.Fish Taco: 4/5 fish was flakey and the cabbage was pickled perfectly. Â Also topped with a chipotle mayo that complimented the fish and cabbage.Chips and Quac: 5/5, chips were fresh and perfectly salted. Quac was probably one of the best either of us have had.

I had a bite of the veggie taco that was the bomb. It&#39;s about time that a taco faster food restaurant has a healthier alternative for the health conscious. Â I will definately visit again.

We visited Guac N Tacos for lunch for the first time during their soft opening. Staff was friendly and professional. My husband ordered the steak burrito and he was very pleased. My daughter and I shared the tinga and steak tacos and the quesadilla which were all fresh and flavorful. I also had a shrimp taco that was amazing! We split the homemade guacamole and it was so creamy and good! We are looking forward to our next visit.

Guac n Taco just opened this week so I&#39;m going to chalk everything up to opening week jitters. The two girls at the front counter weren&#39;t very knowledgeable about certain products. I wanted to try the veggie taco and asked what was in it. They weren&#39;t sure if the veggies were grilled or not (they ended up being grilled but not very well). The tinga was very good and not spicy at all. The steak was okay. My friend had the fish taco and said it was so good! I&#39;ll have to try that next time.The place is small inside with only 6 or 7 tables to sit at. They didn&#39;t have their menu posted on the wall (they have rolls of paper on the wall that I assume will be the future menu). The prices are a bit high and kind of remind me of Big Star Taco prices ($4 for 1 small fish or shrimp taco). I&#39;ll be back to try the other items in the future. :)guac-n-tacos-elmhurst-2,Rachel K.,-Hv6CUyJF1nAiaq-3MyvUQ,"Elmhurst, IL",0,1,0,0,2,GN8gCGEEUvXCtXAa91Brew,3,23/06/16,"I have been two times.

The fillings were equally favorable with fresh ingredients. The flavor of the tinga was so layered and full. Veggies were grilled to perfection. Fish was lightly breaded and topped with a tangy slaw.

Â The cover was more than fair ($5!), and if you get there early enough, they won&#39;t charge cover. Â But if you&#39;re doing that, be prepared to order a few drinks at least.The Guinness mixed drafts are good, and they don&#39;t stop at a Black &amp; Tan.

Â The crowd here is mixed, but there were a lot of younger folks all feeling up on each other (barf.) and later I saw a guy getting kicked out - must be why it smelled like barf near the bathroom. Â There was a questionably drunk/high/homeless man trying to grind on the women here too. Â I&#39;m sure the crowd depends on what band is present - if you can hold your own, you&#39;ll be fine.

The sign out front said &#34;seat yourself&#34; and we didn&#39;t have to wait too long for one of the waitresses to bring us a couple of menus and get us drinks.We started with some &#34;award winning&#34; potato soup and it was okay, if nothing to write home about. With some added salt and pepper it was a bit better seasoned. The grilled leeks were a nice addition though some of them were a bit woody.The fish and chips I had were pretty okay. Nothing wrong with them but nothing particularly special. I&#39;m thinking the fish comes in frozen, which is fine. The tartar sauce was a bit overly sweet but again it was okay.The biggest disappointment, really, was the &#34;sauerkraut&#34; on the corned beef boxy. Sauerkraut has a very specific flavor, a salty brine to it and the acidic tang of being fermented. This was steamed cabbage. Maybe baked. Whatever it was, it wasn&#39;t sauerkraut and if they were sold it as sauerkraut they should get it from a new supplier.I&#39;d be willing to give them another try some night. The atmosphere of the place is beautiful and the staff was friendly enough. Maybe they make fantastic burgers? I hope their other food is better than what we had because this is close enough to home and so beautiful a place that I would really like to become a regular."ballydoyle-irish-pub-aurora,Marianne D.,kMXPkvGLJBLgkZVLPQmSlw,"Naperville, IL",1,1,1,139,4,BiurQHiFgomIOQq3YLfGfQ,2,15/11/15,"My husband and I came here for dinner before a show at the Paramount Theater. We made reservations because a lot of theater goers frequent the area restaurants. Â I recommend doing that especially on the weekend. Reading the negative reviews about service at this restaurant, I wasn&#39;t expecting the best experience. Happily, those reviewers were wrong. Our server, Santos, provided attentive and friendly service. The food was fabulous. The special seafood bisque served on Fridays was fantastic and rivaled those I&#39;ve had at Nick&#39;s Fish Market or The Clubhouse. They also make a great traditional Moscow Mule. The owner, Phil, stopped by our table to see how we enjoyed our meal, which was a nice touch. I saw him do that to other customers, which meant he cares about his clientele and establishment.

(I mean, it&#39;s possible, but, yeesh.) Anyway, looking around, it was pretty obvious if you weren&#39;t sitting at the bar you were forever stuck playing the &#34;Where is our server?&#34; game- Lots of people with empty drinks craning their necks around and the like.But, anyway, the beer list here is very above average for Aurora. They&#39;ve got a lot of great stuff on tap, and even more in bottles. Food was good too, we started with fried pickles which came as spears instead of slices which I vastly prefer. I got a pot roast boxty, which is really something you&#39;ve got to try, as it sort of broke my brain.Essentially, it&#39;s like a giant pot roast taco wrapped in a pancake. The mix of sweet and savory worked oddly well, to the point that I was pretty shocked by how much I was enjoying it. It makes me wonder what else I can wrap in a pancake.Atmosphere was pretty great, but we went there on a night where there wasn&#39;t any music being played or any relevant sporting events on. I could imagine this place being a real mad house when either of those things happen.Menu prices seem just a ~tad~ high for the downtown Aurora area, but I suppose everything seems expensive when you&#39;re around the corner from taco places that serve you so much food you feel like you could barf for less than $10."ballydoyle-irish-pub-aurora,Richard L.,z_YNv_0cGtmf1KxLgRCGPg,"Geneva, IL",0,1,1,23,20,Ile6F-yxAEzf7UYSQ71JBg,4,27/10/14,Not real sure about this one.

This review is 1 star but only because 0 stars is not an option.Tonight we found ourselves in downtown Aurora seeking out a meal. After considering our options, we decided to give Ballydoyle&#39;s a go. And...this is where it begins to go downhill.Our dining experience began with me seeking out a beer list at another table . Once found, we selected our beers and was informed by the server my husband&#39;s selection might not be available. Luckily, this was not true and he was able to get his requested drink.We ordered the artichoke and spinach dip which is not so much a dip as it is a thick spread. A thick spread with, oddly, bread crumbs on top. It was not horrible but was &#34;unique&#34;.We moved on to our selected entrees. I ordered the salad with tuna but asked for the wontons on the side, as I had remembered a previous experience with too many wontons. I requested the tuna raw. When it came out, my wonton strips were on the side but the tuna was fully cooked. I did end up flagging down the server who did offer to replace the salad. I ended up canceling the replacement because my husband ate his meal, had time to chat, and my food still had not come.My husband ordered the steak boxty. The side of mashed potatoes was cold. I told our waiter who did bring replacement potatoes that were lukewarm.The boxty itself was over cooked - the potatoes forming the boxty were hard / crispy. The filling for the boxty was good although sparse. Overall- not a good meal.We gave our server the feedback on my husband&#39;s meal and he said he would tell the manager. We hung around to see if anyone would come by to speak with us but no one did. Which is sad because a lot can be saved just by talking to someone - whatever the manager was doing in the back must have been really important .Our beers were good but I think that was because they were brewed by someone else and all that needed to be done was to pour them in a glass.I remember going to Ballydoyle&#39;s when they first opened- it was so good. Now it seems like there&#39;s a lack of quality control or perhaps excitement.

I love spicy foods, but it was not flavorful at all...just hot as hell. Irish chips are okay, but they put some kind of sugar on them to make them sweet and I&#39;d much rather them salty when I&#39;m drinking.I had my most recent birthday here with friends and family, and the staff were very accomodating. They worked with me through email and over the phone to help me set up a date and reserve a room....for free. They also offer specialized menus that you can design and open bars, but of course that costs extra.The customer service you receive when dining-in is wishy-washy. I&#39;ve had great servers and I&#39;ve had very poor servers. It gets packed on the weekends and I think that has a lot to do with it because they get assigned too many tables to wait on and become overwhelmed. Like I said, it&#39;s best to just go here to drink and listen to the bands.They are opening one in Downtown Naperville and I&#39;m pretty excited about that.

This, however is my first and overall review.Food: 4 stars... they actually have really good food here. I have tried their salads, burgers, wings, appetizers, etc! I&#39;ve never really had a bad experience with Â their food. To be honest, I&#39;ve noticed the portions decreasing a little and the price point remaining the same. This is fine if the quality of the food increases, but, I have seen that flip-flop more recently.Beer: 5 stars... the beer selection here is pretty amazing. They always seem to have something new to try and the cost for beer is pretty standard across the board. If you haven&#39;t tried it yet, get the Milk Stout Nitro from Left Handed Brewing Co. WOW! It&#39;s like the chocolate milk of beers:) Hats off to Bally for always incorporating new and exciting beer selections.Bar Staff: 5 Stars... AMAZING bar staff... even when things are crazy, they find a way to interact and make the expereince fun. They never short pour the drinks or trade out shelf liqour i.e. you pay for one type of gin, they pour another. They take the time to make sure things are correct and that you are happy with the food and drink you order.It really comes across like they are happy you are there. I haven&#39;t received the same treatment at other nearby bars. There is only one exception to this rule... if someone from the waitstaff jumps behind the bar! Which brings me to my next area of rating:Service Staff: 3 Stars... This is what dissapoints me most about Ballydoyle. Service unfortunately is either hit or miss. Whether or night is busy or slow... it doesn&#39;t matter. Most recently, yesterday to be exact, we had a server that came off prickly and it felt like she really didn&#39;t want to be there... but had to be. That sucks when you are on the receiving end of it. ATTENTION BALLY: Servers are the face of your company... when they are passionate about the experience, when they can pair beer wih food, and when they show gratitude that you are there... you will bring in more money. Please, fix this.General Atmosphere: 4 stars... You can escape in this place. It&#39;s fun and warm, and it&#39;s neat to look at all the design and decorations... most of which is from Ireland. Its great to bring friends and family too. If you haev younger ones I would bring them in the day time for lunch or early dinner. It has done a graet deal to enhance downtown aurora and I am glad it&#39;s here.Overall Rating: 4 stars... I So want to give this place 5 stars but there is always something that is holding me back from doing it. Hopefully, they can make improvements with Service Staff and food quality.

Then, just after stepping through, I realized that it is probably because you enter into the bar area and it is meant to make it feel larger and/or more private? Not sure. Anyway, the bar area is pretty sizeable with a bunch of stools and a lively vibe. As you progress further in you are greeted by the hostess who is the gatekeeper to the dining room. Well, one of the two dining rooms. There is one up front (pretty small as it is dominated by a big center island table) and one in back (that, from the looks of it, seemed much larger and a bit more subdued - probably because it was secluded from the bar).Staff: The hostess was friendly and our waiter was great. He was very knowledgeable about the menu and very friendly as well. As far as the cooks, everything came out hot and tasted fresh but we did hit a snag near the end of our meal... something was going on in the kitchen and it caused a SIGNIFICANT delay. But, it was a small occurrence.Food/Drinks: We started off with a house cocktail (I forget which one, but it was tasty) and a Limonada (very tasty and sizable) before jumping into some apps: Guacamole (pretty meh, seemed as if it was JUST avocado...) and we added the Salsa Trio (all were tasty and the Habanero one was GREAT!). For our meal we all ordered assorted tacos and shared. We had: Pastor (one of our favorites), Diabla (meh, pretty passable and lacking... not that great), Bien Trucha (pretty enjoyable and tasty), and Pulpito (WOW! Amazing!). Each order came with four tacos and they are about what you&#39;d expect size-wise from &#34;street tacos.&#34; As I mentioned before, it took FOREVER for them to bring out the Pulpito so they gave us some little app for free - it was four chips with some kind of crap or something on top... it was VERY tasty as well. So, ultimately, the food here is enjoyable you just have to find your favorites.Value: The prices are really not terrible and, if you order well, you will leave full (both your stomach and your wallet).We had an enjoyable first meal at A Toda Madre and are already looking forward to returning again - we want to try all of the tacos at least once!"a-toda-madre-glen-ellyn-2,Bruce B.,Z2ThF1mMg7Q58yZbEnYbsg,"Downers Grove, IL",0,1,0,35,60,9YqcGMo-2mU7WIifrT8EoQ,4,10/08/16,"Ugh.

Saying: This is the way we serve T-bone Steak with a flair you wouldn&#39;t dare challenge.I had lunch at this upscale almost uncious, presumptuous Mexican Restaurant yesterday. I have had many servings of Al Pastor and this was unlike any I have yet to have. It left me speechless. A guest had the fish taco made with Tilapia. Some years ago, When I found out how Tilapia was raised, I swore off this fish forever. Yet here it was featured. At the urging of my guest, I sampled this taco and it didn&#39;t taste like Tilapia. All I could say was that it was some kind of a fish. That&#39;s all.I will say that my Line Drink was astounding and my guest said the Sangria made here is as good as Yerba Buena.

Different, tastes good, not sure how we feel about that...We needed some Guacamole.... ordered it, and it was very good. Not spectacular, but very good.For the meal we wanted tacos.. so we ordered two plates to share (Yay! I always get more that way!) I ordered the Bien Trucha Tacos... (Steak and Chorizo) 4 of them for 11 bucks and they were terrific.. I would get them again (oh, wait.. I have!)Lisa ordered the Pescadillas, so like.. this is the difference between your regular Taqueria and a place like this... also 11 bucks for 4.

This place is phenomenal, city-level sophistication, absolutely delicious authentic Mexican that left me thinking I had just dined at a Rick Bayles establishment without the long wait and frustrating drive to Chicago. Wow. You go, Glen Elyn.I knew this place was going to be amazing because it&#39;s related to the famed Bien Trucha out in Geneva, which I haven&#39;t yet been to but everyone keeps telling me is worth the insanely long wait (and drive to Geneva, ha). We got a same-day res here at A Toda Madre on a Friday night for four and I was happy we did because the wait was up to an hour when we arrived. We were seated in the wayyyyy back which allowed me to peruse the whole restaurant and I totally dig the decor - fresh, modern, not beat-you-over-the-head-Americanized-Mexican, and very cool. We immediately ordered a round of drinks and dug into the menu.Their special drink of the night was some sort of tequila-y grapefruit concoction of which I had about seventy-two because they were absolutely delicious (ok I had 3 but for someone who NEVER drinks, that is a testament to a delicious cocktail). My husband and another friend ordered the strawberry margaritas that appeared to be muddled with real, fresh strawberries, and our other friend went with original flavor margaritas, which were delightfully sugary-sweet syrup free - these drinks are the real deal.To begin, we ordered the guacamole and the ceviche. The guac was delicious but not out of the ordinary, and the ceviche was fresh, citrusy, delicious amazement. After that, we plowed forward to an assortment of four different types of tacos - the bien trucha (meaty and filling with both steak and chorizo), the a toda madre (filled with delicious pork al pastor and pineapple), the barriga (I&#39;m a sucker for pork belly so I LOVED this one), and the special taco of the day which was like cojita cheese curds deep fried and served in a taco with salsa and vegetables - my favorite taco of the night and much less greasy/heavy than it sounds). I typically hate dining in any sort of shared manner (tapas are my enemy), but this actually worked great. We got 4 types of tacos and there are 4 tacos to an order, so we all enjoyed one of each kind.Because my husband can&#39;t go anywhere without ordering dessert, he got the carlotta - a sort of deconstructed key lime pie that was a very small serving but just enough for everyone to grab a bite.Dinner was not cheap - 4 people with several drinks each, two apps, 4 tacos and dessert was well over $200, but it was honestly worth it.

But then this couple got up and we were able to sit at the bar.I loved sitting there because I got to watch our bartender shake it up. He was using his cocktail shakers like morracas! I had the traditional Margarita and it was fantastic! So fresh and yummy! The guac came with a spicy bean dip. So yummy.

I just remembered the Fish tacos I would say blew me away. They were sooooooo moist and flakey, not over battered and oily like most fish tacos I&#39;ve had at other places.

Which Is great, but sometimes I just want to be able to walk in on a busy day and be sat. But hey we can dream right?!The service was outstanding, the waitress was very attentive and gave great recommendations for myself and my family. She knew the menu well enough to be able to list favorites, and answer questions without looking at it which I acknowledge and look for when I dine out in restaurants. I like when the staff are educated on the menu and the ingredients. She made good recommendations and was able to tell me what to expect.The other staff were constantly filling my water and cleaning the table so no extra empty plates were there taking up space, and I always had a full glass of water- which I love. I hate staring at empty dirty dishes.The food was good, not outstanding but very flavorful. Loved the Steak Tacos and the Corn side dish. The Shrimp tacos were just okay, honestly nothing special like the Steak Tacos. But the corn was my favorite part of the meal, light enough but different than any I have had before all around a great combination.Not realizing the restaurant was a Tapas minded feel, we ordered a few things and ended up ordering more because there wasnt much to the dishes, meaning not a whole lot of food to go around. But That&#39;s the style and Idea so I get it, more to share and more to try.

Â Could have used more chips though.We also ordered a variety of tacos (pescado, chilango, and barriga) and esquites. Oh my goodness. All of them were delicious! My favorite is the pescado or crispy battered tilapa with red cabbage on top. It was sweet and sour and spicy and crunchy and soft all at the same time! Couldn&#39;t get enough of it! Â Loved the esquites or mexican corn salad too! Just a tad expensive for a small bowl.

Â In comparison, the fish tacos at del Seoul Â in the city still manage to be amazing even 2 hours later, so I am sympathetic that we didn&#39;t have them fresh, but still... Â To their credit, the slaw was in a separate container - great customer service to allow it not to ruin the tortillas.Tacos A Toda Madre: Sadly, not the best al pastor I&#39;ve ever had - it was a bit dry and my husband got several not so edible bites. Â The pineapple salsa was great, but the salsa morita was WAY too salty. Â I mean, WAY too salty. Â I tried to scrape some off, but I was still inhaling water the rest of the night. Â They were good, but not amazing.Arroz: Â Freaking amazing rice. Â I&#39;m going to try to recreate it at home. Â Loved it, 5 stars, yay.Esquites: Â excellent - the epazote really comes through, giving it a unique flavor. Â Again, though, EXTREMELY salty. Â Really, back off the salt!So why 4 stars and not 3? Â It&#39;s very tasty food, I&#39;d definitely eat there again (usually 3 stars is a take it or leave it). Â I&#39;d also like to try it in person and give it more fair shot.

But there&#39;s a lot more space here, too, which is nice.The menu is familiar to me and meant for sharing -- so I got my companions&#39; preferences and ordered for us all. Guacamole, four kinds of tacos, the esquites and drunken bean sides. Plus drinks, of course.The food is just so damn good. One of my friends didn&#39;t think he was a big guacamole fan, but he thought theirs was amazing. The tacos are perfect little bursts of flavor. The drinks are fresh and delicious.Service was solid, our waters were kept refilled and plates kept moving. They are pretty strict about no modifications to the food, though -- they wouldn&#39;t make one kind of taco without cheese for a non-dairy-eating friend. So I suggest studying the menu beforehand if you have any specific food preferences or dietary needs.This is not a casual family dinner spot.

Â Super loud. Â You honestly have to shout across the table to be heard. Â A certain amount of noise can really give a place energy but this was just over the top. Â It would be impossible with a larger party.* The seats are all so hard. Â You&#39;re just sitting on bare wood.Reservations: Â They say they take reservations but it seems that what they more have is a call ahead list. Â Either they botched it with our party or it just doesn&#39;t work. Â You have to call after 5:45 pm and just by chance I called right about then. Â They said there was still seating available and to call back in 10 minutes. Â ?? Â Being close, we decided to head over and so I called to say we&#39;d be there in 15 and to put us down.

Â What the... Â She took my number to text me when the table was about 10 minutes from being available. We got there and waited..and waited..while party after party was seating before us. Â She had me repeatedly calling back when clearly there already had been a list running. Â Bit annoying but if it works properly, I&#39;d say it&#39;d be a convenient system.The Drinks: Â I had Mangoneada (non-alcoholic mango w/ice). Â $4. Â Pretty nice but mango needs a bit of a pop of lemon to move it into the lively and refreshing realm. Â Husband had the Fresona, which he liked and then the Strawberry Daiquiri, just okay. Â Both were pretty pricey at $10 for a little thing.The Food: Â This isn&#39;t your typical Mexican fare where everything is covered heavily in cheese and comes with a splat of dull refried beans and even duller rice. Â Small plates...very fresh...nice. Â They&#39;re meant to be shared. Â We had an order of one of the grilled skirt steak tacos, the A Toda Madre tacos (pork), and the Diabla shrimp tacos. Â All really good. Â Add in a side of Esquites (grilled corn) and Papas (potato cubes) and we were set.Decor was nice: Â Lots of windows.

My boyfriend and I came here on our anniversary after hearing &#34;rave&#34; reviews. We had high hopes for the menu, and I assumed I would have ample options as a vegetarian given this place was so hip, fresh, and sophisticated. We had late reservation on a Saturday night and had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated. The restaurant was crazy busy and loud. Decorated with the usual pretentious urban decor, The seating arrangements were cramped and uncomfortable. I was closer to my neighbor than I was to my boyfriend.My cocktail, some special with cucumber and lime, was delicious and I think I ordered three. We had chips and guacamole as an appetizer which was good, but nothing special. The menu is VERY limited for vegetarians. I had an order of portobello tacos which were literally garnished with NOTHING. I think there was one other vegetarian taco option but it was slathered in cheese. My boyfriend had some meat tacos, which he enjoyed.Our server was way overly attentive, to an annoyance. We could barely carry on a conversation without him checking in, pushing us to move on with our dinner and leave so our table could be turned over. We were in and out in less than 50 minutes, not my ideal anniversary dinner. Â I won&#39;t be back anytime soon, and I definitely won&#39;t wait for a table here.

Â The location is spacious (not like the last joint) with a swanky-sexy feel when you walk in. Â I know swanky-sexy doesn&#39;t quite fit what you&#39;d expect in Glen Ellyn, but trust me, it&#39;s a nice vibe.There are two areas of the restaurant, both are open and spacious. Â The front area houses the bar and a centerpiece high top table that would be cool for a group of 10 or so. Â The brick decor was also a nice touch, especially lit during the evening. I snooped the back area and it has plenty of seating, but windows instead of brick to allow natural light to come in.And the food.... FANTASTIC! Â I&#39;m a tough grader and give them 4 stars for food quality, sequence of the dishes and seamless service that was helpful, but gave us enough space to fill like they weren&#39;t intruding on our night. Â Well done! Â We enjoyed a tuna appetizer (ceviche like), the roasted beet salad, mushroom tacos and swordfish tacos.

Despite your possibly quaint Chinese dining experience in the dining area, it is most likely not a good idea to go back ever or even think about stepping foot back into that evil establishment that is willing to ruthlessly cut corners in the kitchen at the cost of all customers for its benefit.First, if they tell you they use chicken broth, that is a LIE. They use MSG in ALL of their dishes. The &#34;chicken broth&#34; is faux pas.All customers that have loved wonton soup, be disappointed to know that 90% of the wonton soups are MICROWAVED because management tells the employees they do not have time to wait for soup.They exploit UNDERAGE high school student employees to mix and serve alcohol for them.Your food is most likely horribly RECYCLED in some way.The leftover bowls of white rice that you may not want to pack up with the rest of your meal... it gets recycled into congee. I have even seen some discolored saucy rice get recycled... Perhaps you are a fan of their appetizers... Well, unfortunate for you, they redistribute sauces leftover in the saucers from appetizer orders for future ones. Sometimes employees are so overworked and understaffed that they become lazy and even recycle sauces with pieces of leftover egg roll.Also unfortunate for all customers, the food handling is EXTREMELY DIRTY. Waiters will touch egg rolls or even pick up dropped entree bits with their bare, unwashed hands and throw them back on to plates. Sometimes waiters will do this even immediately after peeling pea pods (yuck) and I have even witnessed employees picking food off of the kitchen floor and replacing it on the plate.The place is overpriced for a crudely arrogant, less-than-mediocre establishment.

Still, I have had versions of this dish done with a lighter touch elsewhere).The noodles weren&#39;t as great: for one thing, the meat seemed rather skimpy, and the noodles were very hard to pick up either with chopsticks or fork (and this is not our first time around the block with either), seemingly due to their length.Service was fine, as was the setting, but overall I wouldn&#39;t be compelled to return with so many other Chinese places around town.

Â When I was there last month with a friend around 7:50pm, we barely made it past 8:30pm. Â A certain female waiter kept coming around to ask us if we are done every 5 minutes!!! Â We kept telling her we&#39;re were not done and she would leave us alone but kept looking over at us as she clears the other table. Â She also didn&#39;t refill our water and we had to ask.Finally, we felt so uncomfortable, we finally left, short of being picked up by the collar and scooted out the door. I looked at the tables next to me and I realized other people were leaving too (probably due to the same reaction). Â I asked the manager on the way out what time the restaurant close and was surprised to hear that they closed at 10:30pm!! There was still 2 hours left and the place looked near empty! I really don&#39;t know why they were rushing their patrons out. Â Maybe it was just that one lady but it really gave me a bad impression of their service: classy restaurant with express-rush-you-out service. Â It just doesn&#39;t go well together. Â If not for this, they would definitely get 4 stars from me.As for the foods...I&#39;ve had the fish fillet congee- fresh fish during their lunch hour. Â It comes to around $6 but if you are feeling a little tired or just under the weather, this light dish is for you. Â It&#39;s also my mother&#39;s favorite dish and she&#39;s a picky eat-out person. Â What I like about it is that the fish in here taste fresh and it doesn&#39;t smell. Â It can taste light enough (not too salty) although it depends on the day.Another dish I&#39;ve tried is Hawaiian fried rice. Â I&#39;ve had better else where before, I won&#39;t lie. Â Their rice was a bit dry and the shrimp was small. Â They do a pretty good job on their Veggetable Kow which is an assortment of stir fried veggies and they leave the greens crunchy just how I like it. Â The Fish Fillet Kow also has those veggies with some battered fish and savory sauce as well. Â Overall, their food is decent, they don&#39;t drench it oil and it can be tasty.

He tried to SNATCH MY DEBIT CARD OUT OF MY HAND, EVEN BEFORE HE BROUGHT US OUR CHECK!!! He brought over the check and waved it in front of my face and told me what our bill was instead of setting it on the table and letting me look it over, like any other normal restaurant does. I was so outraged!!!My boyfriend and I had met there after work to celebrate a minor, but nonetheless special occasion. This waiter completely ruined our evening, and we both felt like it was a waste of time and money eating there. Sure, my boyfriend works construction so he may not have been the best-dressed, but we still ran up close to $50 between the two of us with the appetizer, tapioca drinks, and the UNAUTHORIZED full-size entree bills!

Â We have also gotten take-out since my dad is the kind of person who never likes to go back to a place if a waiter during an isolated visit happened to be having an off-day and provided subpar service.I really like the Cantonese-style noodles - they&#39;re crispy but, when soaked sufficiently in the salty seafood sauce that accompanies them, they attain a crunchy to soft texture that is quite tasty. Â The fish filet makes the dish expensive (the large size is $14.95) but the portions are generous and the fish goes well with the Chinese vegetables.

However, they put the &#34;spicy&#34; croutons in the soup and not on the side. By the time I got around to eating it, the croutons had obviously softened and absorbed much of the soup. When I ordered online, there was no option to have the croutons on the side. Pretty disappointing.The salad was good. The mozzarella was fresh, as were the tomatoes. I loved the arugula, but hardly detect the basil. The lemon garlic dressing was a bit heavier than I would have liked; it drenched all the greens to the point of extreme sogginess. Again, there wasn&#39;t an option to have the dressing on the side.Other items I&#39;ve tried include the Santa Fe Ranch Salad, the Ham on Pretzel signature sandwich, Lemon Chicken Orzo soup, and for breakfast, the Anaheim Scrambler.All in all, the food was okay but I don&#39;t plan on making CBC a regular in my lunch rotation."corner-bakery-cafe-warrenville,Sofia M.,8eJMFVpdmuH-7n7sFHqALA,"Aurora, IL",0,1,0,62,13,69OM3PoDCxTR2T5srAf89g,3,27/03/16,Love the service as well as the food.

In doing so, they won me over with the panini I ordered. I&#39;m not usually a fan of a bunch of grilled veggies slapped on a piece of bread. They&#39;re hard to eat, often soggy, and almost never have good flavor. Except, this was possibly the best panini vegetable sandwich I&#39;ve ever had. And for those veggie AND meat lovers, I bet it would be excellent with a little turkey added on.I had the California Grille on Harvest bread. The veggies were all diced, grilled, and tossed in a pesto sauce and then panini-grilled with a slice of provolone. No sogginess here. I&#39;m not kidding... it was exceptional. I ate every bite and was sad to see it was gone when I finished. It came with a pickle and potato chips for about $6.50. It wasn&#39;t much more expensive than I would&#39;ve spent at a sandwich joint for the same thing with chips.I would definitely have that same sandwich again.

Each time I walked away with one complaint or another. One time the food was incorrect. Another time it took unduly long to receive the food. Another time they delivered my order to someone else and that person&#39;s order to me, and then behaved as though I am the one that is to blame. From my experience at this location, I found attention to detail to be completely lacking. On top of that in my opinion, the training of the staff is very inconsistent because one staff seems to know it all and then I come back a few days later and another staff knows nothing about nothing. From my experiences here, I found the food to be pretty average for the prices charged. One time my sandwich was partially burnt and the manager refused to provide a replacement. Another time the food had become almost cold by the time it was brought to my table. During a recent visit, I ordered several gift cards and also made a catering order. Staff did not know how to work the computer system. Took them half an hour to figure out how to issue gift cards. They blamed it on a new computer system. To their credit they did offer me free coffee during the wait. A manager intervened but even she did not know anything and had to make several phone calls. I wanted one receipt for all the gift cards but they gave me several receipts stating they did not know how to print one receipt. Then they said they do not know how to put the entire amount on one gift card because the new system was not accepting the input!

I&#39;m fine with a neutral experience and I certainly don&#39;t expect to be &#39;wowed&#39;. Unfortunately, I had a much-less-than-neutral experience two days ago. The purpose of my visit was a casual business meeting; I met two associates there at 10AM. When I first arrived, I was the only person in line and stood in line for 5 minutes while NO ONE was at the register. Not wanting to keep the other two waiting, I left the line, sat down and we started our meeting. A while later my stomach was really grumbling so I went back up in line. Again, no one was at the register, even though it was a bit busier; this time there were other people waiting to place orders. There were employees in the restaurant, but they were doing other things with no sense of urgency in helping customers. Again, I got out of line and went back to sit down. After another twenty minutes or so (and a third interruption to our meeting), I decided to stick it out and wait in line. When I got in line the first time, I intended to order the steel cut oatmeal. By the third time in line, it was past 11:00 and they no longer served it!!Finally at the register, the cashier was in the middle of taking my order when a woman who appeared to be a manager walked up to the cashier holding an empty carton of milk and started asking the cashier questions about the milk, as if I wasn&#39;t standing there. WTH???I went to the soda area to get a lemon slice for my water and there were no utensils to pick up the lemons. No employees were within ear or eye shot of me, so I had to grab a lemon with my fingers from the bucket, being careful not to touch any of the others. Nice and sanitary, huh?Lastly, even though plenty of employees walked past our table, no one ever came by and picked up our empty dishes, even though they were stacked at the edge of the table. All three of us ordered our food at different times, which meant employees were at our table more than once. That means that multiple employees have no clue about good table maintenance.I couldn&#39;t wait to get out of there and I&#39;m recommending that we meet at Atlanta Bread Company or any of the other 5 or 6 restaurants in that same area next time (Red Robin, California Pizza Grill, Chipotle, Rock Bottom, Stir Crazy...plenty of choices).

Â They won&#39;t come cheap, but then again, you can&#39;t get them anywhere else either.My wife and I shared the meat and cheese plate to start, which was top of the line. Â Very large and probably could have fed four if needed. Â Next, we had the Duck special of the night. Â Duck was cooked perfectly. Â We finished off with their dessert trio of the night, consisting of the Shot &amp; a Beer cake, Creme Brulee and Caramelized Bananas (ala Foster). Â The entire meal was amazing! Â To cap it off, the service was impeccable! Â Not overbearing, not inattentive. Â Our waiter had a ton of suggestions, some that we followed and some that we passed on. Â He was great though, and we really appreciated his service!It is a high end, classy, restaurant and the main seating area has limited hours (5:30p to 9p). Â Bar stays open until midnight though with a limited menu, so if you are in the area late night, feel free to stop in. Â This place is perfect for a special date night, birthday or anniversary celebration. Â Make sure you make reservations though, especially on the weekends. Â We arrived at the 5:30p opening, and by 6p, the restaurant was packed. Â So good and we can&#39;t wait to come back! Â Might come back just for some more dessert!"niche-geneva-2,Jim K.,WpCSOO8ECBsC8FS9jCIZwA,"Crystal Lake, IL",0,1,0,0,3,ekmZGB59pT6a-6jWVzcaAw,5,28/06/16,"Excellent food and service, does not betray its high Zagat rating.

I have been here twice before and was not disappointed.First...the hostess was just lovely. My boyfriend went to park the car and I chatted with her for about 5 minutes --she was bubbly, sweet and genuinely seemed happy with her job. This is hard to find!When I arrived, my first thought was that the decor had completely changed since I had last been there...and in my opinion, not for the better. It looks like they changed it to open up additional seating, but I think in doing so, they lost the coziness and the intimacy of the place. Open room, hard lines everywhere and very minimal. Since I had been there before, I complained to my boyfriend about the change, but he seemed to be OK with it. We both agreed that it was hard to hear one another (we were seated in the middle of the restaurant despite a reservation and openings along either wall), mostly due to the loud music.They have a few gluten free menu items and were also able to modify those dishes to accommodate a dairy intolerance. I wanted the scallops and foie gras, and since I was looking for an entree, they modified the small plate to include three large scallops, Â one piece of foie gras on top of potatoes and onions. While I appreciate the modification, I have a couple of gripes. When the entree was brought out, I was not told what the scallops and foie gras were plated with (since it wasn&#39;t on the menu, I didn&#39;t know what it would come with), and the scallops were nearly cold. The foie gras was decent, but not as flavorful as I&#39;m used to.Our waiter (his name escapes me), was great. He knew the menu, did not seem at all put-out to accommodate our allergies (nor our questions), was attentive, well-spoken and always had a smile on his face.Perhaps my review is a bit nit-picky, but it stems from my previous experiences here, and unfortunately this most recent visit was not up to par with my past visits. I don&#39;t like the new layout/decoration (the lack of intimacy), I don&#39;t like that we couldn&#39;t converse easily due to the noise and I don&#39;t like that my food was cold. My boyfriend also commented on the food portions (he had the pork shoulder) --quite small.Oh, one more thing: their beer menu is ridiculously good, if you&#39;re into that.For the price, there are other places out this way that are better and I probably won&#39;t dine here again.

It just works. From the moment you walk in and are greeted, to the end of the meal, the service is quiet, helpful, professional, warm, and discreet. The consistency of service, presentation, taste, wine and wine recommendations, etc. is perfect and one that other restaurants should strive for.Why 4 stars and not 5? There seemed to be some sort of issue with the music that night. At times it was quiet, at a few points it suddenly got louder...loud enough that the table became aware of it and everyone started raising their voices to be heard. Leave the louder music to Even Flow (next door), and keep the ambiance you&#39;ve had for so long.I highly recommend Niche."niche-geneva-2,Erika P.,3cz08YuC_v-eBfIO7UIe2g,"St. Charles, IL",0,1,0,15,376,d46cnxPi9g0H8mVBrlfKVw,4,15/01/15,Great pick for a special occasion.

Well at least in my book. I suppose I fail to see what else exists off the main strip.Either way, it&#39;s swanky. It&#39;s elegant. It&#39;s gorgeous. Decorated in a modern, yet classic style with sleek lines, traditional prints, and an abundance of dark woods. Niche sets the perfect stage for a sexy date night.The food itself was delicious. Fresh and local veggies from Bull Run farm, fresh meats and seafood, and vast selection of artisan cheeses &amp; meats - contemporary American done right. You have the option of selecting from their main menu or their smaller menu which features a variety of small plates. We were celebrating our anniversary so we opted to order from both.Watermelon Salad // See uploaded picture. I can&#39;t quite describe the dish and it was nothing what I expected. It was a thinly sliced, perfectly cut rectangle of watermelon soaked in vinegar with a couple holes cut out and replaced with pineapple, basil and avocado. It wasn&#39;t bad, but it&#39;s not the first item I recommend.Burrata and Apricot Salad // Get it. Don&#39;t think twice.Grilled Ono with Dill Spaetzle // For a girl who vomits at the thought of seafood, I gave the Ono a try and actually liked it. That said, it comes highly recommended. The dill spaetzle - addictive.Bull Run Tart // Meh. Mixed emotions. For a vegetarian dish it was good. I wasn&#39;t crazy about it. The spaghetti squash was drenched in butter, which I could have done without.Mango Bomba // Amazing. Blackberry tapioca? Don&#39;t knock it &#39;til you try it.Trio of Arancini // These tasty morsels are on the small plates menu. If you get anything, get these. They&#39;re quite filling, full of flavor, and the best damn arancini I&#39;ve yet to eat.The service was professional, prompt, and knowledgeable. However, when I asked to have my overly buttery spaghetti squash replaced with some steamed spinach I saw a lovely $5 charge on the bill. That wasn&#39;t cool. But, our dessert came free of charge so I suppose it all worked out. No hard feelings.Elegant. Sexy. Fresh.

Â My experience was not very good. Â Two of us walked in without reservations. We were promptly greeted but were told that there were no tables available. Â There were clearly four or five tables available in the bar area. Â I asked about those tables and if they served dinner there. Â We were told &#34;yes&#34;. Â This was a bit awkward. Â We were seated, given the menus and asked if we would like to order a drink. Â We hadn&#39;t picked up the drink menu yet and then were asked three more times in five minutes if we would like to order drinks. Â I felt very rushed.Once we ordered drinks, two glasses of Prosseco, we were immediately asked if we would like to order food--again, rushed.I asked about their three course chef&#39;s choice and the waitress had no clue. Â She went to the kitchen to ask and listed off three things on the menu. Â I was a bit disappointed because other places I have been the chef does something a little special other than what is on the menu for at least one of the dishes.We ordered off the menu and asked for a Cabernet to be served with our food. Our food arrived, and it was very mediocre. We were never brought out the Cabernet we ordered! I had the tuna dish and the other person had the pork dish. We also ordered two sides--a vegetable salad side and the basil and eggplant dish. Â Both of the main dishes were very bland and lacked the complexity of flavors I have come to experience in small plate dining.We both left food on the plate and hardly touched the sides. Â The basil eggplant dish was the best of the bunch but went unfinished. Â I rarely ever leave food on the plate by the end of a meal let alone in a small plate dining experience!Our plates and Prosecco glasses were cleared and the waitress said, &#34;Oh, I didn&#39;t bring your wine because you didn&#39;t finish your Champaign&#34; Â  Seriously???We asked to see the dessert menu. Â There was a little food that had fallen off the plate on the table in front of us and it was never cleaned. Â I asked if we could have a napkin to clean the food off and instead of cleaning it she handed me a napkin to do myself.Needless to say, we did not order dessert!Terrible service and mediocre food.

Most recently, my fiance and I decided to spend his birthday at Niche - he called ahead and asked if they might be able to create a special menu catering toward our specific (and very different) tastes for the celebration. Chef Serena and sommelier Vinny designed a menu that did just that, for which we were very thankful.Our meal included a roasted chestnut soup that was thick and rich, and absolutely wonderful, as well as a fois gras torchon that was so delicious my fiance ordered three more. Even I had to admit the fois gras was the very good, and I do not like fois at all. We also had a beautiful pheasant stew that I will not soon forget! Dessert included whiskey cake, stout ice cream and a meringue cigarette that reminded us of a recent Top Chef episode. Overall, it was a very good meal and we were very pleased that the staff helped put it together for us.That being said, I deduct some points for the fact that the items we were served were all regular menu items - if I were to return to Niche this evening, I could order the exact same items. We were really hoping for another Kohler experience, where the chef and sommelier put together a completely unique menu that had never been served to another guest, nor will it ever be. Considering that our dinner at Kohler included Dom PÃ©rignon champagne and some of the best wines I&#39;ve ever tasted, all for a significantly lower price than Niche&#39;s birthday dinner, I can&#39;t give Niche five stars (I&#39;ve only given two restaurants five stars, and if you read those reviews, you&#39;ll see why). The meal was very good, but not exactly what we were looking for.Still, if you&#39;re in the Western suburbs and looking for an outstanding meal - of the same quality as some of the top restaurants in Chicago - Niche is definitely the place to go. The food is mostly stellar, and the service, as I mentioned previously, is top notch. Some of the waitstaff has been at the restaurant since it opened (some even before, as it was owned by another group/called something else), which says something about the way they treat their staff (which I think is, in turn, passed on to the customers as well).I would not call the decor a mix of urban farmhouse and loft, as another reviewer does - it&#39;s actually a bit dated, with lots of dark woods, dark carpet, and truly awful ceiling tile. Most, if not all, guests dress well, meaning collared shirts and trousers for the men (often jackets as well), and dresses or dress slacks for women.One thing to note is that the restaurant only serves American wines. Say what you will about California and Oregon, but American wine is limiting and not for everyone&#39;s palate/meal. I wish they would broaden their horizons and offer some foreign wines as well."niche-geneva-2,Charlotte S.,JuGopo_vKaabtVFBpCi7nQ,"West Chicago, IL",0,1,0,0,8,Sz0-1QQg4zp1wfO9YLW_Tw,4,19/06/13,I stopped in at Niche when I spent the day in Geveva IL.

The result was a noticeable dialing up of both service and food quality.We took advantage of the 5 course chef&#39;s menu with wine pairing. The Shrimp and Grits was an extraordinarily light dish. Grits with creamy and tasty artisinal goat&#39;s cheese, a tomato coulis layered with 4 different spices, including cayenne paprika and tobacco which provided surprising depth.The pleasant arugula salad was not overpowered by the capers and acted as a palate cleanser.The Winter Cassoulet was presented as a deconstructed pot pie, the result being an unctuous dish layered with flavor, as opposed to a classic Toulousian dish with big chunks of meat. It was excellent.Humbolt Fog was pleasantly presented with freshly baked crackers and accompaniments.The white chocolate cheesecake was so light, and perfectly matched with both a chocolate and berry sauce.Service was spot on from our enthusiastic, young waitress Liz, who provided just the right balance on conviviality and service. The chef, Serena, walked around and was happy to take questions and explain her sources.Wine pairings were well chosen, if not &#39;top drawer,&#39; but for $25 a person it was very acceptable, although the pours were just a wee bit short of generous ..I very rarely give 5 stars, as the meal really has to be both a memorable and faultless experience for me, but Niche earned it, and if they can maintain this level of cooking and service it would be both wonderful and hard work.I look forward to returning and seeing this standard being maintained"niche-geneva-2,Frank G.,PKBun1Rwq_ffpQga43Og8w,"Geneva, IL",0,1,1,48,1,FGFuv36xbPecBJzq4-mSlQ,5,21/11/13,How have I lived in Geneva for 7 years and just now tried this place?

Â Evidently, the guy that answers the phone is not the guy who makes sure the tables are set correctly.We ordered a variety of small plate dishes and desserts about 7:30 pm, but it wasn&#39;t until 9 pm that everyone finally had a dish served to them.

Â  He told us, not ASKED US, that he was going to serve in courses. Â It was his way or the highway. Â After too much time between courses, I asked the waiter if he could please just bring out all of the dishes.

Â They had been served, finished their meal and paid their bill by the time we were finally able to pay our bills.20% auto gratuity added to parties of 6 people or more so we as customers had no recourse for bad service.The fact is seven people went to Niche.

Â  We ordered the cheese plate, it was good, not amazing, but acceptable. Â I ordered the cod. Â For $30, I got about $2 worth of cod - if that...it was four bites.

I had a very nice pinot noir, and the waitress working the bar (the bartender was running late) was great. The general vibe and ambiance of the place was good and I thought I was in for a nice evening.Once seated, I started with a mushroom tart, which was supposed to be topped with a poached egg, but was closer to hard-boiled. The flavor was good, but the egg was just plain overdone. It was followed by a mediocre salad, and the rib eye. The steak was very fatty and had an okay flavor. It might have been better had it been bone-in. I finished off the meal with some decent gelato and coffee.The waiter dripped some hot coffee on my arm and pants.

Â Here is an overview of what we had:$10-Duck confit nachos: perfect portion of crisp and protein. Â This was the most expensive appetizer out of 8 or so.$8- glass of sparkling wine each for a friend and I, although they do have $500 bottles of wine so this may be where people start racking up their bills.Free-Mango sorbet intermezzo: perfect palette cleanser$24-Kalmata olive marinated chicken with egg plant and artichokes over a red pepper sauce. Â Very moist and portion was very satisfying.$27-schezwan beef: huge portion of tender steak in a sweet Asian sauce.We both had sides of the garlic mash too, not quite as good as 302&#39;s goat cheese mash but right up there.Entrees ranged from $16-35, the most expensive being a filet.$10-Niche coffee: Â the exact same as coffee 302 Â and thank god it is. Â Perfect blend of coffee, grand marnier, irish cream, with a cinnamon sugar rim.$6- creme brÃ»lÃ©e with chocolate chip cookies: Â a classic$8-peanut butter panna cotta with a mini vanilla bean milk shake and warm fresh Italian doughnut holes. Â This was the most expensive dessert btw.So, I don&#39;t usually include prices in reviews, but with all that we got out of there for a little over $100.

Â The vindaloo beef came with sweet potato hash browns topped with roasted Brussels sprouts and French green beans. Â The combination of the sweet, bitter and savory is fantastic. The beef is also top notch. Â The vindaloo sauce was described as Niche&#39;s take on an Indian / curry based topping for a perfectly cooked tenderloin.

It is a place to go and enjoy an evening of extraordinary tastes and wines with company deserving of such. If your unable to sit for several hours and casually absorb the expertly prepared courses paired with a very unique wine list, then go elsewhere.It is the absolute best the Tri-cities has to offer. And while not on par with a restaurant such as Chicago&#39;s Tru, it also doesn&#39;t require cashing in your children&#39;s college fund.A couples night out: a couple bottles of wine (white for my bride, red for me), cheese plate, appetizers followed by a shared soup (combined table side), salad, main course and desert, typically averages $250 to $300. And is worth every penny. Less splurging can cut the tab by half; I just don&#39;t have that level of self control.The wine list is not large, but has a very unique diversity of styles, regions, and vineyards. A bit midscale in price with bottles starting around $40; it has some excellent selections.A bit of sherbet cleanses the palate, and Niche&#39;s cotton candy brought at meals end is the perfect primer for desert.If you have never been, pick the date, call ahead for reservations, and enjoy."niche-geneva-2,Eric S.,AjN8XLrtLul5H95qzIjDkw,"North Aurora, IL",0,1,0,0,2,dJZV8WKZXHHENX7kjI9Tww,5,14/05/14,"The food,service, and atmosphere were impeccable.

Regardless, I&#39;m glad the place is here and we had a chance to go.We went there on Mardis Gras after seeing a promotion for their Fat Tuesday Feast Winter Tasting Menu. This being a minor holiday for most but big for foodies, we expected a crowd, and there was none. In fact, there were only two other tables occupied during the 2 hours we were there, which makes me fear for the future of the place. Maybe it&#39;s just the Tuesday night factor.Everything we ate was thoughtfully prepared, from fine ingredients, and tasted fantastic. We started with the best pork belly I&#39;d ever eaten, went on to lobster fritters, fried oyster on brioche with crawfish Ã©touffÃ©e, strawberry sorbet intermezzo, chicken sausage jambalaya, and a perfect pecan tart. Our server, Jeffrey, was attentive, pleasant helpful, and warm, and didn&#39;t bat an eye at several &#34;information requests&#34; that we made. Realizing that we were there on a slow night, I nevertheless couldn&#39;t imagine a more pleasant atmosphere.The wine list is intimidating and we copped out to a special offering associated with the current tasting menu. I&#39;m not a huge wine person, but I recognized very few of the offerings, most of which where in the $50-$100 range, or beyond. We didn&#39;t ask for suggestions, but I don&#39;t doubt that we would have gotten good advice if we had.I suspect the place is very forgiving with respect to dress and protocol. I would be comfortable there in anything from jeans and a nice shirt, to a suit and tie, and there was no hint of pretense or snobbery from any of the staff. Thy have coat check service for those so inclined, or just hang your coat on the back of your chair.We intend to put this long overlooked venue into our rotation, and are looking forward to our next excuse to go there (St. Pat&#39;s special sounds intriguing!)."niche-geneva-2,Anna N.,t7DFCOhBAPiJQHQ2TDZSBQ,"Batavia, IL",0,1,0,0,5,kzKeaeit8FtTKF_HsEymRA,4,01/02/14,"The inside in cute and cozy, especially in the midst of winter.

Let me break down all the reasons why:First off, the staff was incredibly rude, even right off the bat. My mom, dad and I came for AYCE sushi, but we told them my younger brother was going to order a separate dish for himself (since he&#39;s picky and doesn&#39;t do raw fish). Immediately, our waitress emphasized that he was NOT to eat off any of our plates, including any appetizers we ordered from the AYCE menu. I noticed she kept coming over every few minutes to &#34;check up on us&#34; (but really, to stare down my brother and make sure he wasn&#39;t touching any of our food). Talk about unnecessary paranoia/rudeness to really turn off your customers.Secondly, the sushi wasn&#39;t fresh, nor was it rolled well. Almost every piece I picked up with my chopsticks fell apart, and in terms of taste and presentation, none of the rolls I ordered blew me out of the water. Additionally, a lot of the fried appetizers were beyond oily (I mean they were BATHING in pools of oil).Thirdly, THEY CHARGE FOR HOT SAUCE. Have you ever been to any sushi place that charges for sauce?? Because I haven&#39;t (nor should I ever expect to be charged for sauce). Needless to say, this surprised and displeased us all.To top it all off, they charged us an extra $12 for being unable to polish off our plates. Beware: even leaving a bit of rice will cost you. I&#39;d always heard about these policies at other AYCE sushi places, but this was the first time I had ever actually been penalized for not stuffing myself into a food coma. Blasphemous.That&#39;s not it, however. As we were leaving, we expressed our unhappiness with regards to all of the above, and the staff responded extremely rudely: &#34;so what?? Thanks for your opinion.&#34; Never in my life had I had my whole family spoken to so rudely! We made it clear that we would never return.All in all, a bad bad bad experience.

Â That&#39;s exactly how I felt today. Â We ordered a variety of nigiri - tuna, salmon, white tuna, red snapper, yellow tail, and mackerel. Â All were average - I&#39;ve had much better, but I&#39;ve also had worse. Â All pieces had a ton of rice. Â Very sneaky...that&#39;s how these all you can eat sushi places make you full!!We also ordered some of the other apps - edamame (over steamed/boiled to the point where some were pretty mushy), miso soup (fairly bland), seaweed salad, chicken yakitori, and the grilled squid (unfortunately the official name for it escapes me, but that was the best part of the meal). Â We also ordered 2 rolls - alaska and volcano. Â I definitely give them credit for doing a good job with their rolls. Â Not over-riced, nor was the rice itself mushy, and the flavor was good.I would definitely return to this place for when I&#39;m starving and in the mood for sushi rolls in particular...however, if I want the best quality sushi/sashimi, I may end up going elsewhere."para-sushi-and-ramen-darien-2,ROLANDO C.,Q170Qr8fHhNrU9lN9oCZhA,"Darien, IL",0,1,1,1,505,oYfVVL2Im9ZojoeyWalG-g,3,14/08/16,"Absolutely delicious sushi and chicken teriyaki , And they greet you with a smile.

Fantastic broth, proper ramen noodles, soft boiled egg, and two servings of some healthy grilled pork were all I needed for a full belly and a smile on my face. Fair prices and friendly service were abound, but the strip-mall feel and odd choice in background music were enough to hold me back from the ultimate five. I&#39;ll be back without hesitation!P.S.

They did not put enough utensils and I just had to grab an extra plate + napkin from the table next to ours.

The sushi is tasty, just enough rice and stuffed rolls. They give you enough ginger and wasabi, dislike when places skimp on the ginger and wasabi. The location on 75th street in Darien is very clean and has nice decore. The staff is nice and always welcoming from entrance to exit. The Rainbow roll was excellent, so much in the roll and the avocado was creamy and fresh.

Sushi Para recently took over this space from Hokkai Japanese. $16 for lunch and $20 for dinner. I think they&#39;re making a great effort towards preparing their food with care so that customers will want to return. You&#39;re greeted warmly upon entering, and the service is friendly and attentive throughout your visit. The booths and tables are nicer than several of the other Sushi Para locations I&#39;ve been to. The all you can eat menu is large and contains appetizers, nigiri, simple maki, and specialty rolls. I like to start with the fried scallops and sweet potato tempura. The fried appetizers, shrimp tempura, and tempura crisps used in some of the rolls taste freshly fried. At some Sushi Para locations, the shrimp tempura and tempura crisps often taste like they were fried an hour ago. Not so here. The nigiri are better than what&#39;d you get in a grocery store but not much different than the other Sushi Para locations. However, I find the rolls are superior at this particular location; they are better constructed (not too much rice and you don&#39;t have to worry about rolls breaking apart when you pick them up with your chopsticks). The final benefit of choosing this location over the ones in Chicago is free parking. This has become my go to spot for when I&#39;m in the mood for all you can eat sushi.

Ordered Ramen and Chicken Teriyaki and Tempura Appetizer. With only Three other people in the restaurant our meal came out 20 min later. My daughters Ramen came out first and my Teriyaki followed 5 min later. I ask where my Appetizer is going to be served, my waiter said shortly. Shortly meant 10 min later. The food was marginal Teriyaki was over cooked and cold the vegetable garnish was hot. I was hoping to have a great food experience. I will always go to Sushi House in Westmont and Yokohama by the train station. When I commented about my experience on facebook they deleted my comments and blocked me from their page.

EVER!Saturday afternoon, 1 pm for lunch. As soon as we walk in, literally two feet from the door, we are asked &#34;How many?&#34;. We explained it was our very first time here... we thought it was still Hokkai... but now it&#39;s Para. I walked up to the hostess stand (which is basically the sushi bar, too) and asked to see a menu as it was our very first time here. (Note to all restauranteurs - THAT&#39;S especially when you want to be at your best, so people like us come back after their &#34;very first visit&#34;!)It should be noted that at this time of day, on a Saturday at around 1pm, there was only one table eating; a couple with two very young children.You would think they would have actually wanted our business on such a slow day where employees outnumbered the guests.I was immediately handed a &#34;To Go&#34; menu. I could not read it because the print was so small, and we were &#34;wanting&#34; to dine there, so I asked for a &#34;real&#34; menu. I was handed one, albeit what seemed as a bit reluctantly.)I was given the &#34;dinner&#34; menu (a 1:05pm!) which had the ACYE (All You Can Eat) sushi deal for $19.95, not $15.95 as is their regular lunch price for lunch. I mentioned it and was handed a lunch menu, along with some attitude.My wife and I decided to try it, and sat down.We asked for sake, and was told they could no longer sell liquor because their liquor license &#34;expired&#34;. Â OK, first bad sign that that they either PLAN on going out of business or are incompetently managed.I asked for the AYCE (All You Can Eat) sushi off their lunch menu, and was told I could not have it... I could ONLY have their All You Can Eat off their &#34;dinner menu&#34; at 20% more money for the exact same food Â - at one o&#39;clock in the afternoon!OK, second bad sign!I asked if tea came with the ACYE sushi, and was told NO, that will cost extra. OK, third bad sign, but not totally unreasonable.Again, you would think with only ONE table at their Saturday lunch service, they would be more accommodating, or even more personable to help ensure our return. I guess not.Then we read on their All You Can Eat Menu...IMPORTANT TO NOTE THIS: You are CHARGED FOR ANY LEFTOVER RICE ON YOUR PLATE, AS WELL AS SUSHI you don&#39;t finish. Yes, YOU ARE CHARGED FOR RICE LEFT ON YOUR PLATE!!!What?!!! Â Do they charge per grain of rice? What constitutes &#34;leftover sushi rice&#34;?Everything about this place screams of another sushi house DESTINED TO CLOSE FOR LACK OF BUSINESS.We left, drove only about 2 minutes east and ate at Aodake Sushi and Steak near Home Depot on 75th, We&#39;ve eaten at the one in Romeoville quite often, and it&#39;s always been stellar in terms of BOTH, food and service.The Aodake on 75th in Darien was no different. Perfect service. Perfect food. We felt like valued customers. That&#39;s why Aodake has recently opened their 3rd location-in Chicago. We ate and ate, drank a few sake and could not have been more pleased when all was said and done, that Para was so bad we left. We had a great meal at their competitor and were quite pleased.SAVE YOUR MONEY AND AGGRAVATION you&#39;ll no doubt receive from Para, this &#34;chain&#34; sushi house that offers nothing but attitudes, bait and switch menus, and worse, NO INDICATION OF EVEN WANTING TO TRY TO PLEASE THEIR &#34;NEW&#34; CUSTOMERS .(The hospitality industry, which both my wife and I were in for many years as a restaurant managers, calls customers &#34;guests&#34;, based on wanting to treat them with the same &#34;hospitality&#34; as if they were in your own home.Not at Para.Not at all!)SKIP THIS TERRIBLE PLACE and go to any one of MANY SUSHI RESTAURANTS IN THE AREA. My guess is that Para will be closed before you get there, anyways."para-sushi-and-ramen-darien-2,Nick W.,5XdSmrlf0q43i70wcGSCzA,"New Braunfels, TX",0,1,0,0,2,qzDIZZwsbWveFprzkGiccw,1,16/08/15,"Okay, so I wanted to let other people know about the first time experience me and my girlfriend had here. We will never be returning here due to the following issues we had on our visit.1. When we walked in we were not given any menus nor any kind of idea of if we were even going to get a server2. We sat there and waited and waited and waited.... no one came to ask us what we wanted to drink, to give us menus or anything.3. I was missing utensils on my side of the table, not to mention it was kind of dirty.4. Before we even ordered, one of the girls tried to give us food that didn&#39;t belong to us. It was given to the man behind my girlfriend there after.5. We finally were asked if we ordered and my girlfriend stated we didn&#39;t even have menus yet. We got the menus.6. Several minutes pass after we put our menus down and waited to order. No eye contact was given from the waitress. She wasn&#39;t even the one to take our order, another male waiter came to ask, didn&#39;t write anything down.7. Moments after we order another incorrect dish is delivered to our table. It sits there in front of us. We have to flag down a server to tell them it&#39;s not ours. It is then delivered AGAIN to the man behind my girlfriend.8. The first part of the order comes out, it was sushi, it was wrong. My girlfriend specifically asked and made sure the man heard it clearly. He says he&#39;ll get it to her at no charge at least.The food quality was great, the food was crafted well, hot and tasty. The service was horrible and probably the worst dining experience I&#39;ve ever had. Not only were we upset by the wrong food deliveries but we heard the same from others around us. In the time we had been there for the first 15 minutes, there were at the very least 4 wrong food orders brought out to the wrong tables. No attempt was made by the staff to right their wrongs. There was no sincerity either. As a person who works in the food and service industry, I know for a fact that this is NOT acceptable. We will never return here. It&#39;s a real shame too since the food was so good.EDIT: an extra tid-bit, I got sick later on in the night."para-sushi-and-ramen-darien-2,Peter T.,MVfg92zztvJH7WlLbbD_Ow,"Chicago, IL",0,1,0,0,11,huCC6c-Mfco_E85Y1dC4fA,1,05/12/14,"I had been to Hokkai here and wasn&#39;t impressed.

Â From being the first customers on a weekday morning or in the middle of a post-church Sunday rush, service is always spot-on.For breakfast, crepes, omelettes, or giant frittatas are great choices, but the menu is large enough to hold something for everyone. (Yes husband, I even mean you!) Portions are huge, so I usually walk out with a to-go container. Â For lunch, I definitely recommend starting out with one of their 3 or 4 soup selections.

And a skillet at that. They just opened 2 weeks ago and I had been patiently awaiting their opening. They have no social media foot print and last time I swung by, they were looking for cooks, according to the signage. I called on 8/23 and the number was temporarily disconnected. Guess they opened 3 days later.I stopped in around 10 am and they certainly weren&#39;t busy. I welcomed them to the neighborhood and overheard the owner talking to a customer about their other locations, etc.My server was from their Orland Park restaurant, lives in IN and didn&#39;t seem to want to spend more than 7 seconds at a time at my table. I felt rushed and had to beg for a carafe of water.The skillet arrived eerily quick. My poached soft eggs were cooked medium and there was a large chunk of burnt cheddar cheese, a half a piece of raw bacon, along with some nearly raw potatoes in the skillet. My first two bites were nothing but crunchy bacon and only 5 slices of mushroom? Half of my skillet was just potatoes and by the time I ate the overcooked eggs and stirred it all around, I lost my appetite. The toast was barely toasted and was eerily buttered with a yellow spread that I question if it was margarine.I tend to eat half my skillet and take the other half home to enjoy another day, but there was no way this was going to be enjoyable another day. When I brought this all to the owners attention, he asked if it was sent back. With what I saw, they still should be looking for a cook. He offered to give me 50% off... so six bucks for some over cooked eggs and coffee?

After finding an ad (Clipper Magazine) for this place I figured ok let&#39;s give it a go this past Friday 7/15. My husband, 2 young daughter&#39;s and my teenage daughter and I arrive around 11:45 and it&#39;s pretty empty...3 tables. After being seated we waited 5 minutes until a man comes by and plops down water and walks away. I&#39;m looking at the menu....a hair stuck onto a grease covered page...yuck. Another 5 minutes go by until our waitress comes to ask if wanted anything to drink. I order coffee. I get warm not hot coffee....ok whatever. She leaves....almost 10 minutes later she finally comes back. I&#39;m getting annoyed at this point....I ask about the Free Mickey Mouse pancakes advertised for kids....she gives me a weird look and says I never heard of that. I pull out the ad and show it to her....ohhh it&#39;s a coupon she says. Nooo it&#39;s not listed as a coupon I say. Then she brings the hostess who tells me it&#39;s a coupon and that in order to receive the free pancakes we have to purchase 2 adult entrees. I&#39;m sorry.....where in your ad does it say 1) that it&#39;s a coupon and 2) that you must purchase an adult entree? Ok fine I say....so then that includes the kid drink like all of your kid&#39;s meals. Their response...no the drinks are on you. Â I ask if they can include the 2 kids drinks given their misleading advertisement since I can&#39;t use another coupon. They go show the ad to the owner and presumably go get her....well the waitress comes back to tell me &#34;ummm yeah, the owner says you can only get the pancakes with the purchase of 2 entrees and the drinks are on you&#34;. I tell her to tell the manager that when it comes to advertising you need to be clear and not mislead people only for them to come in and then you tell them ohhh well what we mean by this is this not that. What the hell?? My husband and I are beyond aggravated with the extremely poor service ALL around but we&#39;re starving at this point so I say fine....live and learn...1st and last time we come to this place. I then tell the waitress we&#39;ll Â just go ahead and order. She has the nerve to tell me &#34;No, I have to go put in an order and take care of other customers since I wasted so much time trying to figure this out.&#34; Did you really just say that???? I&#39;m sorry you, the owner, Â and hostess couldn&#39;t figure out your advertising mistake....I&#39;m sorry you have NOOOO idea how to advertise clearly, address issues, and your customers more importantly ...and 1st time customers as a matter of fact. Great 1st impression (let me clarify this is sarcasm). Needless to say we immediately got up to leave. The owner was by the register talking to the hostess sees us coming and she rapidly walks away. Wow...I thought. We paid for the coffee and left. This &#34;issue&#34; could&#39;ve EASILY been resolved and maybe gained us as regular customers assuming the food is better than the service and cleanliness.

The food was good and fairly priced. I was turned off by a view of the kitchen where a waitress was standing at the door eating her breakfast but other than that it was a decent meal. When we went to pay we presented the coupon and were told that they could not accept it because they were not set up for it. My argument was that they sent out the coupon which brought us in to try the restaurant and there was no verbiage to state that we could not use it until a certain date when they were prepared. It was only 5 dollars but for them not to honor their coupon and have no apologies either was a real turn off and due to the poor customer service we will take our business else where.sophias-house-of-pancakes-bolingbrook,Denise B.,c_jb3jk70CvzQpnOHNx2AQ,"Humboldt Park, Chicago, IL",0,1,1,1,20,vC2gnMHumajDNHMujJgBjQ,1,09/01/16,First time here.

Â Before I could answer she answered the phone and ignored us while she talked with her kids. I said excuse me I need to go. She then looked at the bill and called another coworker because her dumb butt could not figure out why the bill was different. If she had let me answer her question in the beginning she would know why. Then the other employee came over and called the waitress to verify like we wrote our own bill. Bunch of idiots.

So we decided to try the restaurant another day I order my meal and a crepe on the side, this time I asked can they add cream cheese and yes they did they added a dolup of plain unsweetened cream cheese, the plain cream cheese that you put on a bagel, so that was a fail again and of course the strawberries were not ripe again. When we received our check I saw that they charged us $7.70 for one crepe, i couldn&#39;t believe it because I was just there the other day and the waitress charged us a $1.95. I asked to speak to the manager and he was afraid to come and talk to us at or table so I went to him. Pete was the owner and he was VERY rude he told me this is my restaurant and I can charge whatever I want, I told him it was your waitresses responsibility to inform the customer home much it would be.

My favorite was the red Thai chili sauce. I like food spicy so that suited me. We topped off the meal with Mango Sticky Rice , a dessert we enjoyed from street vendors in Bangkok.

I&#39;m no Thai expert but I am a fan of &#34;Thai Medallion, Authentic Thai Cuisine&#34;. The brown rice is by far becoming a favorite of mine too.

Been back a couple times since my first review here and I couldn&#39;t be more impressed with the food. The portions are not only large but the food is beyond fresh and flavorful. You can do Thai right and sometimes it can go wrong. Fortunately I was the one wrong with my first review because the food here could not be any more right on value and taste. Easily the best Thai restaurant on both aspects in the western suburbs.Will add more later. I got it so wrong on the ground chicken with spicy basil leaves. And the Tom Kha soup is not only done exceptionally well, but with all really good soups, it also has its own personal distinct taste per recipe from chef. Though an extra spring roll or two is always thrown in is a nice touch aside from that spring rolls are probably the only item not up to snuff on the whole menu that I have tried so far. But spring rolls can be like fortune cookies at other Asian restaurants. I will update on what else was ordered.

It took 10 minutes from call to pickup. Very fast!I ordered Tom Yum Pork (a small bowl for 4.99) and the Pad Thai Chicken (8.99). The bowl of soup is a very good size. Same with the Pad Thai dish!As for the soup, very yummy. Not the best tom yum I&#39;ve ever had, but certainly better than other ones I&#39;ve had. Lots of fresh veggies, and surprisingly, lots of pork! A lot of Thai places skimp on protein, but not here!The Pad Thai chicken was excellent as well. Plenty of veggies and chicken! Seasoned well too; not sure what type of seasoning they used, but it was good enough that I licked the to go pan it came in. On the savory to sweet scale, I would say it was more towards the sweet side. Not too sweet, but very good.Somsri is very good, and it&#39;s fairly priced. It&#39;s nice to have another Thai option in the area. My favorite Thai of all time remains Thara Thai in Champaign, Illinois, but Somsri has a chance to become my favorite in the suburbs.One of the easiest barometers to use while judging a restaurant is if I will return.

Order was ready when I arrived. They included two complimentary fried spring rolls and a small soup. The rice was good! I was definitely full and satisfied and will be having them for lunch more regularly! Idk if I&#39;d ever dine in as this place is not really close to home and my lunch is only 30min.

Â Tonight I called and placed our first order. Â My husband actually picked up the food, so I can not comment on the interior - but I will tell you that the man who took the order via telephone was very kind and polite and expressed his appreciation. Â When my husband picked up the food he asked that we let him know how it was and how he was doing, and he threw in an order of crab rangoon. Â As someone who is BIG on customer service I really thought it was great that he so sincerely wanted feedback. Â Well I&#39;m so glad to say that it was FABULOUS. Â Glad because we now have more delicious ethnic food in Winfield, and glad because I can give great feedback to someone so lovely.I dove into the crab rangoon first, which was done really, really well. Â Instead of the oversized &#34;too much wonton too little crab/cream&#34;, these were bite sized pieces with a delicious crab/creme filling that was really exceptional. Â Their sweet and sour was also great and didn&#39;t have that artificial sweetness like so many others. Â Really delicious.We also ordered the Panang Curry with Chicken and Pad Thai with Tofu. Â The Panang was mouth watering and had a beautiful color and consistency and the spices were just right. Â The chicken was great and we both loved the dish. Â Pad Thai is one of those things I&#39;ll always order first from a Thai place I&#39;ve never been to. Â Its such a staple that if it isn&#39;t right I just won&#39;t go back. Â Fortunately, it was perfect. Â I always like a little lime wedge with mine, but it didn&#39;t come with one. Â Oh well, not a big deal at all. Â I&#39;m not even sure that&#39;s a &#34;standard&#34; thing, anyway. We also had the spring rolls. Â These were your basic spring rolls, and they were very nice.All in all I think Somsri is an amazing addition to our little local cuisine scene and we are really lucky to have them here.

They only have the Hot n Spicy flavor and I was a little worried about trying them at first, but I&#39;m glad I did.

We went the first time and our experience was pretty bad. Well, so we gave it a second chance and it wasn&#39;t much better. It takes a while to get the pizza and it states on the menu that their &#34;homemade pies&#34; take 25-30 minutes to make.SERVICE:Not the greatest. Maybe they&#39;re understaffed like so many of the reviews say, but hire some people! There are tons of unemployed Americans that need jobs. Whatever. It took a few minutes for us to be seated both times, even though there were booth open and not a ton of families there at the time. I asked for tips on drinks, but the waitress told me she doesn&#39;t drink beer. Ok, but my question was on the cider. Ok, I&#39;m not going to ding her for not drinking alcohol. She never offered us another round, nor brought us water. After finishing our drinks during the appetizer, she never was really around for longer than a second to even think about bringing us anything.My husband said that he would give the service 3 stars, but I disagree..closer to 1-2.FOOD:Garlic bread:We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer. We received it maybe 15 minutes after ordering it. For what it was, it should&#39;ve taken 10 minutes. It was overdone and burnt **the second pic is of the garlic bread they brought out second&#34;. It was literally rock hard. Also, no garlic. The second basket brought was better and not hard, but still just like glorified toast. It was like an italian beef roll cut in quarters and toasted, then with butter on it. No fresh garlic, and not even the crappy garlic powder that some restaurants use for their garlic bread. Pretty disappointed.Pizza:Good, but nothing to write home about. I like the texture of the braided crust, but there&#39;s really nothing else that is greater than average. About 2-3 pieces of nickel sized sausage per piece of our sausage and garlic pizza. Average pizza, that&#39;s what I would call it.Drinks:They have a good selection beer/cider/wine list. For that, I give them a star. Unfortunately, the average bar has a good selection.It takes a significant amount of time to order, wait for food, and then wait for the bill after finishing food. The service isn&#39;t the greatest. I wish we would&#39;ve had a better time, either time, but we won&#39;t be back. With so many other pizza places in the area, we won&#39;t be back."raimondos-pizza-and-pub-north-aurora,Samantha T.,2_4nVZUljLafnj_Dq3MjNA,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,1,0,0,1,bRarFViZR52fzEHaCG5STA,1,15/08/16,One of the few places to get pizza by the slice.

Looking at you Lauren L Ticket #79255 (in case anyone researches or cares).This is my first review only because this was way outside of the norm of service you receive anywhere and management, as well as potential patrons, need to be aware and have some expectations set if you are lucky to have our server.We were in town for a family reunion. This place had solid reviews both in ratings and quantity. It was not very busy, maybe two other tables, and we were greeted by a sweet girl directing us to our table.And that&#39;s when it went downhill. How you may ask when we just walked in? It started with our server beginning to take our drink orders and abruptly saying she will be back when someone yelled at her from the oven. This set the tempo as our server brought everything over with the cold hand of indifference including her robotic, insincere, and minimal conversational tone.For the record, we ordered a few drinks and a bottle of wine, Valley of the Moon, from their reserve menu along with several pizzas and some gelato for our daughter. EVERYTHING was GREAT.Disappointing we had to get her attention to get anything. You know...as in pretending we were waving down a plane to rescue us at one point. She was not engaging. No refills on beer or coke offered. Our bottle of wine was brought over, sans cork, already open with two glasses. She was never in any hurry. Making eye contact was difficult and when it did happen it provided the opposite reaction from what we needed. I walked over to the bar and register, where she was hiding from giving any additional discretionary effort, and I begin speaking to my 8yr old daughter about dessert. We eventually ordered there, with her, because why would we not want someone to ask us if we needed dessert as is the almost knee jerk reaction tradition of any server. Kudos for being different. She did not look up. I finally asked what the gelato flavors were where she recited. We choose and walked back.Her engagement was reminiscent of a 160 character restriction on Twitter. She only thanked us while we were walking out, which obviously was facetious and muscle memory.We tipped 20% because who knows what day she had. I hope it gets better. For me, if I lived here I would never return because of the very negative, memorable experience we had.Again great pizza! But maybe you need a buffet because we could have fumbled around serving and smiling at our table ourselves...or hire nicer robots."raimondos-pizza-and-pub-north-aurora,Blythe J.,wNeaEjNGTUeBWBRUA8Ml2w,"Blanchester, OH",0,1,0,0,12,7any26KgQ3CmIW5AUNA8rA,1,12/12/15,"Their home made sauce is delicious!

The marinara was really good and the meatballs were awesome. Â We went back a few more times and thought that we found a nice spot we would be coming to for years.So...why the 2 stars? Â Well, we went back about a month ago and had really bad and slow service. We sat a long time and waited for the server to come and greet us at the table. Then it took a very long time for each phase of the meal and we actually got the feeling we were more of a bother to the server than anything. He didn&#39;t seem to really care to do his job one bit. We chalked it up as a one off and that maybe he was having a bad day. Â But... We went back again last night and had a very similar experience. Â Eventually that same waiter came over, but only to tell us that our waitress is coming soon. She did, and we order a very simple meal: 2 unsweetened iced teas, a meatball sandwich, and the bruschetta. It took 10 minutes for her to bring us the very watered down iced tea (might as well just drink water). Then it took another 47 minutes to get our food. Yes, I timed it after the iced teas took so long. Â 47 minutes for a meatball sandwich and bruschetta! Â Unfriendly, blah attitudes to with that awful service too. Â To add insult to injury, my wife got sick that night and I felt like complete crap too.Could it be us? Â Did we do something to piss them off? Â Why the crappy service? Â We are not demanding people and always treat people in restaurants nicely regardless of how they are because 1) we are respectful; 2) we don&#39;t want spit and boogers in our food. Plus, we always tip - even when the service is not deserving. So, it seems to me that it&#39;s just how this place operates. Regardless, the service is so bad that we will just go elsewhere.Oh yah, 2 stars. Well, the 3 non stars are for the last 2 servers and experience, plus the decline in food and getting sick. The 2 stars given are because I know the owner is a good guy and we had a nice experience with him our first few visits.

I saw rave reviews and had high hopes. (This happened with that movie The Hangover - people said it was the most hilarious movie ever made of all time EVER...I saw It. Â I laughed once. I believe I may have laughed at least double that, had it not been so, so hyped.)Anyway - I was intrigued with Italian Nachos. Whaaat? turns out, it was sauce and cheese over nacho chips with Italian beef sprinkled on top (for $2 more bucks).Overall it was a little disappointing.We got the &#34;original crust&#34; ala supremo. So...and maybe those of you in North Aurora had once experienced the nectar of Gods that was Franks Pizza - and if so, please know that this is where I was - Franks was our favorite. But this was not Franks. Boo. The crust was bland. It was crusty on the outside and warm and pillowy on the inside, but it lacked depth beyond that. The sauce was under seasoned. actually, the whole pizza seemed under seasoned. I mean, it wasn&#39;t the worst pizza by any stretch of the imagination - but it didn&#39;t blow any socks off either. Also - when the menu said &#34;ask for dipping sauce&#34; with the crust style - we did and we thought it would be garlic butter sauce...and it wasn&#39;t. just bland marinara. Lesson learned.The service was extraordinarily friendly. There was one young guy in there running the whole of front of house- Â the bar and all the tables and the running of food. It wasn&#39;t that busy but that kid was working his tail off.We heard the beer selection was awesome, but we weren&#39;t drinking and frankly, I am not a beer person but maybe that would change things...the Italian beef that had been sprinkled on our nachos was good and I would consider returning to try the beef on its own...but probably not the pizza."raimondos-pizza-and-pub-north-aurora,Bob P.,eMoBipZBYOAdvct0_990tg,"Geneva, IL",0,1,0,1,10,CBfKOv0s-1rRG0K6l-XQGA,2,04/12/14,"I have lunch here twice a week.

So, using the excuse that I still didn&#39;t have my kitchen organized enough to cook, we headed out to try Raimondo&#39;s.First of all, the thing that got us here is that they have a pretty nice beer selection. While I wish a little more was on draft, the bottled selection was diverse and exciting. Even better, their staff really seems to have a passion for it and took to suggesting beers for us based on what we had already ordered.We ordered a double dough with giardiniera and sausage. The pizza was really delish! The toppings were clearly very fresh and sauce was fantastic. Normally left over pizza is just something I need to get through, but I was super excited to come home the next night and heat it up again. It really was a well made delicious pizza. I&#39;m excited to try more combinations of toppings as they definitely give you a TON of choices.One of the owner&#39;s came over and asked how everything was and mentioned that he didn&#39;t think he&#39;d seen us in there before (they clearly know their customers). We told him we just moved in and he insisted we have some gelato on the house. It was such a nice gesture. He also asked where we were at and let us know that they deliver as well, which is great! Its a nice atmosphere, so I&#39;d definitely like to dine in and enjoy the beer selection most of the time, but having the delivery option is always good too.If you are in the area and in the mood for some homemade fresh pizza, don&#39;t pass this place up!

My personal favorite is the spaghetti with sausage and my kids love the ravioli. The garlic bread that comes with your pasta dish is also a nice combo of butter and garlicky goodness. I also recommend that you try the Italian Nachos appetizer, an interesting combo of tortilla chips, marinara sauce, hamburger and cheese. As alluded to earlier, on most occasions the owner visits our table and is genuinely interested in us and likes to talk &#34;craft brews,&#34; which I also enjoy.

The beer selection is excellent (especially for trying stuff you may not be able to get in the stores), the pizza is fantastic, the pastas and sandwiches are great, and even the gelato is good.Beyond all of that, though, is the atmosphere. There are people enjoying beers at the bar, older folks, younger folks, and lots of families when we go. My 2-year-old son asks me about Susie and Ryan and Mike a lot - he loves the attention they give him (and the pizza, of course).There are beer tasting events, charitable events, and other cool community things all the time. I had my first beer from Solemn Oath there, for example. Also, after their St. Baldrick&#39;s event, most of the staff was shaved bald! That&#39;s some commitment.Overall, I miss the old-fashioned pizza joints from the past. (Charlotte&#39;s, Shakey&#39;s, etc.) There&#39;s a personality to them that&#39;s not manufactured by some marketing focus group. Raimondo&#39;s has that warmth and personality.

When I returned them the owner explained to me that they&#39;re supposed to be that way!!? He explained that they do not make them themselves. They also bake them because they don&#39;t have a fryer. He buys this brand because they are gluten free (no breading). While I appreciate that the business has gluten free options I am not gluten sensitive and wanted crispy tasty buffalo wings, not baked chicken with gross sauce.

I myself wasn&#39;t a fan of the &#34;original&#34; crust.. just too doughy for me.. if I return I&#39;d definitely go with the thin crust. Â I could only finish 2 pieces of pizza, and it was mainly because of the dough... not the toppings.Of the 3 (I tried all), the custom one was actually my favorite. The bacon was delicious, crisp and flavorful, and the &#34;secret blend&#34; sausage is quite good.Our server was decent, he knew a lot about the beer selections. One suggestion to the owners; provide a daily list of beers on a piece of paper or whatever so we don&#39;t have to stand up from our table and try to read the chalkboard every time we order a beer.The cheesy garlic bread appetizer we ordered was embarrassingly small. It&#39;s just bread and cheese, and at that price point, it simply needs to be a larger portion.While we never spoke to the owner personally, he was making his rounds around the place and seemed nice and personable. We did make a reservation and was pleasantly surprised when we arrived that there was a table with a large &#34;Reserved&#34; sign on it with my name on the check. Bonus points for that.I&#39;m sure eventually we&#39;ll try this place again (my wife loves pizza), and I&#39;ll definitely go with the thin crust next time and probably order my own custom pizza.

Â They are gritty and taste horrible. Â This gluten-free is the best I have had from a pizza joint (but still not as good as the store bought SCAR crusts, Pastorelli&#39;s sauce, and some Sargento Mozzerella). Â Problem is this, unless you are eating here, don&#39;t order it for take-out. Â They are notorious for telling you a time over the phone and then making it very early. Â It has happened three times (that I know of) in the last 4 purchases. Â Once the owner even laughed about it like it was funny that my pizza had been sitting on top of the oven for 20+ minutes. Â Honestly, don&#39;t understand why if you say on the phone 45 mins you would make it 20 mins early, but that is their deal. Â I will not buy from here any more because it has happened multiple times already. Â PS. Â Don&#39;t believe Mike (the owners son), the first time this happened he was very apologetic and gave me a song and dace about they are a family business, give us another chance, yada, yada... then the last time, he acted like I was ridiculous for requiring that the pizza be made closer to the time specified time then 20 minutes and stated that I should take my business elsewhere because I was obviously too picky for them to make happy. Â LOL! Â Seriously, I cannot make this up. Â Requiring a pizza establishment to make a pizza and it still be hot and edible when I pick it up, was too much to ask."raimondos-pizza-and-pub-north-aurora,Dan T.,nASIq7hlgdxlqeFgKB0jsg,"Aurora, IL",0,1,0,25,17,8H3eoLWHy4q3H32qKwvUug,1,15/04/13,"Their Pizza is the BEST!!!!!!

Green apple slices, walnuts, avocado, cranberries and crumbled gorgonzola tossed with mixed greens and topped with pomegranate dressing.

Call me a snobby city guy - but Plainfield is not synonymous with Italian cuisine.The first time she took Â me to Vita Bella - I was impressed: good beef - mellow atmosphere. The service was very good. They didn&#39;t honor the coupon they sent in the mail - but they gave her another one for our next visit.The second time we went - the food was still very good. The service was cosi-cosi. She brought the bread - but not the oil. I was trying to remember if they had oil the first time. I can&#39;t understand bread without oil - but whatever.Then we had them cater our Labor Day event. We got a tub of mostaccioli. We got a tub full of beef. We got a tub full of chicken. We got a tub full of salad. We got a tub full of garlic bread and one full of Italian bread.(I am kind of tubby so that all worked for me - well maybe not the salad.)Did I mention the healthy helping of giardiniera and a pan of sweet peppers?I not only got enough food to feed a small army (or me and four of my buddies) but the quality of the food was pretty stellar. We have all been to a party or an event catered in this style - this was the best one I have ever been to. This food was amazing. People were commenting on it as they shoveled it in. I over ordered - but have no trouble dining on left-overs of this food.Here&#39;s the punch line. The price was so reasonable that I Â felt like I was getting the deal of the year.

When my boyfriend was eating his stuffed mushroom, he almost choked on a BIG piece of plastic. I had known something was off with just the taste, that proved it. Our server, however; Angela, was sweet, attentive, and very professional. She made sure our concerns were addressed, and handled professionally. She is too god for this restaurant that obviously cares little about there quality of food. When a manager on duty came over to discuss the poor quality of the &#34;appetizer&#34;, he apologized and took them off the bill (rightfully so). We ordered prior to the mushrooms a beef sandwich and a pepperoni pizza with mushrooms and sausage that was &#34;homemade&#34; and when that arrived, the disappointment continued with the worst pizza I&#39;ve ever had, and a flavorless beef sandwich that I had ordered got and received otherwise.

The bartenders know what they&#39;re doing and are usually willing to give samples if there are any questions about certain taps. The beer selection started off really varied and interesting but has since devolved into a hop lovers paradise with not much in the way of lighter brews (pilsners, lagers, etc.). That&#39;s fine for me but my wife isn&#39;t a fan of bitter beer (her words) so she&#39;s hoping they come around.There are about 15 seats at the bar, maybe 6 hi-tops that seat 4 each and 8 or 9 low tables that can be pushed together for groups. 22 large screen TVs mean everybody gets a view if they want to see whatever sports game is showing. Restrooms are clean and large.

Â Good beer, food, and people... what more can you ask for?Drinks: come for the great beer and whiskey selection. Â 24 rotating mostly American microbrews and 100+ in bottles. Extensive collection of whiskey: at least 80 bottles of bourbon, rye, Scotch, Irish and the like. Tasty cocktails too if that&#39;s your thing.Food: the food is probably my favorite pub food in the area, but can lack consistency. The burgers are a generous 10oz with tons of choices for toppings. My favorites: Ring of Fire (spicy and delicious), Like a Rolling Stone (can&#39;t go wrong with bacon and a fried egg) and Revolution (cherry peppers, avocado and onion straws). Wings, apps and pizza are great too.People: staff is (mostly) great. Seen a few good and not so good ones come and go since the beginning, but overall I love these people. Especially the bartenders and manager/owner Nick.Overall: sit at the bar, ask for a sample or two and try a new craft brew, order some wings and a burger, and enjoy. 90% of the time, it works every time."12-handles-ale-house-crest-hill,Julie D.,pZcVT30B7_IdIFofeqjQcQ,"Joliet, IL",0,1,0,12,22,sIaecKrFcNoRDQlDtm2nmg,5,29/03/16,"Under new management...and you can tell!

A little pricey, good, fresh, hot food, but I didn&#39;t feel it was anything special.The Eagle serves your typical Greek lunch items, gyros, pitas, etc., and also has hotdogs/hamburgers. There are many of these kinds of joints around the Chicagoland area, and especially in the Western Suburbs.I got the chicken pita and fries which was about $8. The pita came with lettuce and tomato. There was a decent amount of chicken, but it was so dry! It was like something my sister left in the oven too long!The fries were pretty disappointing; there were skinny and not much flavor to them. I prefer the fat cut fresh steak fries that you get at some of the other Greek grills.Overall, I felt I paid too much for food that was unimpressive, and I wished I would have just eaten at home."eagle-restaurant-downers-grove,Kavita B.,YTh35T3wEvja456NcgcKZw,"Reynoldsburg, OH",1,1,0,19,7,IiE7oWcfpY1O38cDrfv53Q,3,24/10/15,"Eagle restaurant offers burgers, gyros, sandwiches, salads, I mean a big menu with lot of options..

They have a fairly decent sized parking lot and a decent amount of seating inside.In visiting Eagle Restaurant I decided to try the hot dog. The hot dog I received came on a regular non-poppy seed bun. The bun was soft with no signs of dryness, but was rather wet. The frank itself was a skinless sausage, it was heated fairly well. Celery salt was visible on the dog, the peppers weren&#39;t too hot and the onions were well applied. The big problem here starts with the mustard and relish, there was just way too much of both of them created a soggy hot dog experience. The pickle used was way too thick rivaling the length and circumference of the sausage itself.The unbalanced condiment application here is particularly bad, this really threw off the entire taste of the hot dog. The problem here wasn&#39;t the ingredients themselves, simply the preparation. I can&#39;t comment on their other food, but this hot dog earns only one star.

I can only assume that the only Â reason this place is still in business is because there&#39;s no place for grown folks to hang in the burbs but dam...pay the money and drive ANYWHERE else.coops-den-restaurant-and-lounge-bolingbrook,Katrina C.,I0sPueYYTpv1ZtzD3euykw,"Houston, TX",0,1,0,13,3,TFKzUuKlTD1Z1_BdZOsm0w,1,08/06/16,I love the place and food always have a great timecoops-den-restaurant-and-lounge-bolingbrook,Jacquelyn R.,13-3JHOSup98BkBjA8-_bQ,"Downers Grove, IL",0,1,0,42,4,Agi7_qBX51fm6IBdiFU9wQ,5,03/04/16,"Went here for my friends birthday and ordered food and 2 drinks, a so called new waiter over charged my card claiming it was the wrong order..

Â I did reserve it for a repast, however, and there were some good parts and some bad parts.The good: Â The owner was there and he seemed to be personable enough. Â He checked on us to see if things were okay frequently and allowed us to use the sound system and projector for a slide show of memories.The bad: Â The food was mediocre at best, and we could not cater in. Â I understand that the place needs to make money, but if you are going to insist that we use your food services to cater the event, please make sure that it is top shelf.The ugly: Â The bartender overpours severely. Â I ordered a long island iced tea. Â Usually I get top shelf because that makes the smoothest drink. Â The first one was made with liquors from the well, and it was not good at all. Â After taking a sip, I returned it to the bartender and asked her to make me one with top shelf liquor. Â I offered to pay the difference in drink prices, but she informed me that she was not refunding the money for the first drink and I would have to pay for the second drink as well. Â I was angry, but I decided to pay for the second drink and not cause a ruckus since I was there to honor the memory of a departed family member.The second drink was just as terrible. Â There was no balance and it tasted nothing like a long island. Â As much as she overpoured, I can see why Coop would be as indignant as he is about collecting fees for reserved table seating, cover charges, and two-drink minimums. Â He is losing his SHIRT on liquor costs.Unless there are some significant changes, I will never go back to Coop&#39;s Den, despite the fact that thy are in walking distance."coops-den-restaurant-and-lounge-bolingbrook,Shawn B.,IUovRgnXRGiQwXfYSbZ8eQ,"Bolingbrook, IL",0,1,0,0,17,L-6MLI6WDY5DmHFSB0COIA,1,13/09/15,"Visited September 12, 2015 for the first time.Here&#39;s my experience:1) The band was nice! The music and song library was superb. The band itself would get 5-Stars.2) We ordered wings, fried okra and mac and cheese. My wings were pretty good, but my wife&#39;s weren&#39;t cooked long enough. The fried okra was TERRIBLE. Absolutely TERRIBLE! When we bit into the okra it was still frozen in the middle. Ugh. It tasted like cornmeal. Â The mac and cheese was horrible as well. Most of it was burnt edges. It looked like leftover mac and cheese from a family gathering LOL. I certainly would not recommend the food at all.3) Ordered the pomegranate Margarita as a drink. The flavors were right on. Kudos to the bar tender.4) I feel horrible that I can&#39;t remember our servers name but she was good. She recommended the great drink. She was kind and genuinely sincere. But I find it very interesting that the servers don&#39;t stop back by the tables to see how everything is tasting. Especially since most of our food hadn&#39;t been touched.

And the manner in which this fee is collected is quite aggressive. Those tasked with greeting guests are quite unpleasant, and have no limits in nagging patrons for the $5 fee. Why on EARTH would they charge anyone to simply enter? This should have been a red flag for me to turn right around.2) There is a $50 charge to make a reservation. If you decide that this is just absurd and then arrive at the restaurant with a party of five or more, it&#39;s likely your entire party will not sit together. My visit to Coop&#39;s Den included a party of seven. We were sat at two booths across the aisle from each other. The reason for this was the lack of availability of tables. This was completely untrue from looking at the room, and accommodations could have been made. The unpleasant door staff made the decision not to accommodate our party. Once seated, an additional room was illuminated with plenty of tables already set for groups of eight! When we requested to be moved, we were told no because the larger tables were zoned for another waitress. And to be clear, this message was delivered by the restaurant manager/owner. Really?3) The service at this restaurant is terrible! After being seated, we received NO wait staff attention for close to 30 minutes. When bringing this to attention, we were told there was a &#34;miscommunication&#34; in who was assigned to our table. Once we identified our server, it took close to another 30 minutes to order and receive drinks. I could go on and on here with the lack of friendliness, attention to our needs or the simplicity of providing water for ALL those seated - not just half the party. If I did that, this review would not be digestible for anyone.4) I don&#39;t know where to start with the food here. What you need to know is that it&#39;s disgusting. And typically I would not make a statement like this because taste is a personal preference. In this instance I feel comfortable making the assumption that NO ONE will enjoy this food. The fish is fishy, there is no seasoning used and whatever you do AVOID the mac and cheese at all cost - seriously!5) Despite the lack of service or quality food - this &#34;restaurant&#34; has the NERVE to have a dress code. Gym shoes and hats are not allowed past 8pm. This rule is not widely publicized, but is veraciously impressed upon patrons. The recommendation for those wearing gym shoes is to visit Walmart for the appropriate attire. What a disaster.I was there to celebrate a family member&#39;s birthday. Unfortunately, the experience was ruined by Coop&#39;s Den&#39;s. If I were you, I would RUN RUN RUN as recommended by most here.As for you Coop, I recommend a transition in business model. One that is similar to Ed Debevic&#39;s. One in which terrible service is the goal.

We arrived around 7 and were immediately seated with menus. The ambiance of the place was nice with a full bar, low lights and probably good for a date night--that is if you happen to be pushing fifty.I was so confused of the dress code. Most were dressed in semi-cute yet casual dresses, but I saw a woman in an evening gown &amp; shawl &amp; men with suits! I guess that&#39;s how the old heads get down? Meh.I could barely see the menu, I understand setting the mood, but if I&#39;m struggling to see the selections that are essential to getting me in a good mood then there is a problem. The waiter came promptly to take our orders &amp; I was perplexed when the waiter informed me that I could not get two order of shrimp off the pick two menu. I didn&#39;t understand how I couldn&#39;t get the substitute being that I was a paying customer, but whatever, I didn&#39;t fuss because I try to be a conformist at times.Ordered the fish sandwich &amp; steak fries--that was a mistake. The fish was juicy, but flavorless and the tarter sauce was horrid as well. I suppose I bought my southern cuisine expectations into a place that was not up to par. Also our waiter did not keep our glasses full which was unacceptable, I understand more patrons came in, but it wasn&#39;t that busy where he couldn&#39;t refill drinks, I literally had to ask. The band was coming in, but we hightailed it out because we had no desire to party with our parents.Lastly, that drive-thru threw me off. I&#39;ve NEVER seen a bar/lounge with a drive thru, it was so random. In short, cute place for oldies--perhaps other menu selections would&#39;ve been better. However, I was much too young and for the love of humanity please add seasoning to the food!"coops-den-restaurant-and-lounge-bolingbrook,Joni R.,5G1tAE_dmM-FbuejUl5Aog,"Chicago, IL",0,1,1,141,2,PseorK3m9aBz_imUmmLqYQ,3,25/05/14,"I wanted to write this review last night after my experience but decided to sleep on it first...yep, still had an awful experienced at Coop&#39;s...here goes. Forgive me in advance for the lengthy review.My friend is relocating to another state and she wanted to have drinks with her family and friends at Coop&#39;s Den. Her friend called and made reservations Â for a few tables to seat about 15 guests. She was told the tables were $50 to reserve, seats up to 4 people each and we had to order drinks/food in order to keep them. However, if they noticed the tables weren&#39;t being used and it was busy they would have to take the table back and would refund $50 we paid for the table so that other patrons could sit down. Ok seems fair enough cool.When I arrived I noticed that the tables were just plain tables. No balloons, no special note saying farewell to my friend nothing. Ok....moving on.Here are the good points1) The drinks are great and reasonably priced.2) The bar food is good and the wings are huge! Not a fan of big chicken wings but my friend said they were tasty.3) The band played for about 2 hours and they were awesome. The singer with them was great as well. The DJ really turned things up when he started playing old school and house music as well as the usual line dance jams.Now comes the drama. After spending close to $300 on food and 1 round of drinks, nibbling on farewell cake and listening to the band we were ready to get it in and send my friend off in a big way. I was about to order champagne and more drinks when the owner comes up and asks my farewell friend if they could take the table that wasn&#39;t being used. She said yes if no one else from her party shows up. Problem with that was people were showing up by then and also they were speaking to the wrong person. Kay and I made/ paid for the reservation so they should have asked us. They knew who we were because I introduced myself at the door and I told the waitress to ask Kay and I any questions concerning the bill..not the party girl. She wasn&#39;t aware we had purchased the tables for the night.Ok to wrap it all up..1) They took the table and didn&#39;t refund the $50 for the table as promised because they felt we had used the table earlier. I said well that is not what was promised to us. I don&#39;t mind helping you( the place was packed and had been full for a while) but you really are being unreasonable and unprofessional. We also didn&#39;t have the option of keeping the table for our other guests who were now arriving. So, I decided I was not going to spend another dollar in Coop&#39;s. No bottle service for us.2) 2 wait staff for the entire venue! Although we received our food hot/ warm, she never came back to see if we needed anything else. She reappeared when it was time for the check.3) Service charge on your bill they will not remove. Now I&#39;m a pretty generous tipper so she made a little more than her service charge because it wasn&#39;t her fault they had her running around the place servicing multiple parties and delivering drinks.I will never returns to Coop&#39;s Den and will not recommend this place to any of my friends. I&#39;m accustomed to much better customer service and I didn&#39;t appreciate them not adhering to their policies. Just a real piss poor experience for me.

Anywhoo, the bartenders were very friendly the whole night, and even recommended things for us to try since we were first timers. My cousin ended up getting a glass of prosecco and the shrimp tempura. I got a glass of moscato and the spinach and artichoke dip. 3 people recommended it to me so I just knew it would be the best I&#39;d ever had, I&#39;m sorry to say it was not. It was too creamy for my taste and seemed to be missing some garlic. It also would&#39;ve been nice if you had the option to get chips instead of toast points. They had a live band that night (Friday) and they werethebomb.com. I believe the band was called &#34;E Minor&#34;. They really turned the place out. They sang a bunch of my old school favs and a couple of newer songs too. No one danced, but I was told by one of the regulars that the DJ and dancing doesn&#39;t get started until after 11:00. Understood. I&#39;ll make sure I come back and check that out. It&#39;s safe to say I&#39;ll be back.

I did have balloons in hand for one the band members, but I was not having a party (no cake, no decorations, etc). Yet, I was subject to a 5 minute tirade about how the band invited too many people without telling him (as if they weren&#39;t going to take our money), and how the restaurant already had a couple of parties planned and there wasn&#39;t a lot of room. Â He tried to usher us to go sit with another group and I explained that my friend and I was just by ourselves and were looking for a table to eat. So he finally let us sit at a bar table.

I was with a friend looking for live music bars, luckily we did our research and found Coop&#39;s Den.The main event was a Jazz &amp; R&amp;B band, which was great, but unfortunately we walked in on the final 12 minutes of their show. Still had to pay a cover, but only $5. We were seated almost immediately. Not going to lie, I wasn&#39;t expecting us to be one of the very few lighter skinned individuals in there. But no biggie, music was good, the owner, Lawrence Cooper was cool and we enjoyed our time.Specials on Saturday night were $5 any liquor shots... Anything more complicated like Irish Car Bombs or even a Vegas bomb was like $8 a piece. Good deal otherwise. They had a decent selection of beers on draft, my favorite from their menu was Blue Moon though.Now for the music, great!! I enjoyed the live Jazz band, which was accompanied by good vocals. That band even covered Blurred Lines by Robin Thicke, and I was impressed. Definitely a good act to catch when you can, next time I&#39;ll come earlier.After that band though, the dance floor was opened up and, DJ John Young span some tracks you won&#39;t hear from the usual DJ. I enjoyed it though, he had an ear for a constant beat and flowing tempo.. Not your average DJ, in my opinion, he even threw down some older house music. From the looks of the girl I came with, it seemed she was feeling the music, after all, that was what we were pursuing in the first place..... For a restaurant, Coop&#39;s Den has a really good sound system. You can feel the bass like there&#39;s woofers underneath your chair.. I was seated in the center next to the bar, so that&#39;s a compliment....My favorite thing about this place was that: everyone, from the band members, to the staff, to the owners, to the folks attending were all in such a good mood and ready to dance. I loved it. It was such a good feeling to have.Anyways, I rate Coop&#39;s Den 5 stars, because they were very understanding while serving us. We had ordered drinks and they didn&#39;t taste the way they should taste, so we talked to our waitress, Annette, who brought over Mr. Coop and switched out our drinks. If that&#39;s not excellent service, I don&#39;t know it is. I appreciated that they understood and were accommodating.

There aren&#39;t many options in Bolingbrook if you don&#39;t want to eat at a chain restaurant. I went with my 11 month old son and his father. Because its marketed as more of a nightlife establishment they didn&#39;t have a high chair (that&#39;s a negative get at least one! Especially sice you open t 11am) but the owners were super super nice and we had a great lunch. The owner/hostess even held our son so that we could eat! Where does that type of service happen!? Nowhere! The chef was also super accommodating and made a special vegan dish for my son and sliced some fresh fruit for him. I really wish they&#39;d market more as a restaurant so that more folks would visit and enjoy a meal.I have gone in the past to listen to the live music which is awesome but I would be lying if I didn&#39;t say often the music is too (teetering on obnoxiously) loud. That&#39;s the main reason I don&#39;t go at night because you can&#39;t really have a conversation with the people you&#39;re with. I still love this place for the food however.

Â However, overall the food is hopelessly average. Our waitress was amazing (she usually runs the bar) She knows exactly what cocktail I want when I come in and mixes it perfectly.

Sunday late lunch. It was very busy, full bar and majority of seating was full. Bar full of game watchers, dining room full of church goers and families. There is no partition between bar patrons and dinners, yet the volume was reasonable. The place itself was fine. They attempted to make an inexpensive interior look nice... with success. I liked the way it looked although it was rather dark for an afternoon. Lights world have been nice. It took a bit for the staff to come to our table.. We only saw 3 waitresses, and this place is rather large. Staff was helpful and friendly. We ordered a burger and the fried chicken with Mac&amp; cheese. The staff informed us the Mac was made by the owner. My hunger couldn&#39;t wait to taste it. Plate consisted of 3 PC of chicken fried in a cornmeal batter. Bland at best. There was 1 wing and 2 thighs. I don&#39;t believe this was a chicken.. It had to be a chick. The pieces.. Almost unidentifiable, Â where the smallest I have ever seen, lacking meat, not just seasoning. The Mac was an even bigger disappointment. Made by the owner, it was dry, flavorless, and was lacking any creaminess... Â  And cheese. Truth... Worst ever. The book for lunch was 52..$. Â  Â That included one beer. There is no value.

When I think of five stars, I think of this place.The best feature of Capital Grille is the service that they provide. From the host, to the waitress, bartender, even the chef, there is definitely a culture of service and hospitality that emanates the second you step through the door.They are extremely attentive to each guest, and you will def get special treatment if you come for an occasion like a birthday or a celebration.The steaks are of course all the rave. If you get you get your steak anything more than medium rare: SHUNNNNN. You should be ashamed!!! These are some of the most tender, dry aged steaks that I&#39;ve ever had. Go to Mcdonalds if you want well done hamburger!!!Okay, the next thing I want to recommend is the lobster Mac n cheese. They mean it when they say lobster. It&#39;s not just little shreds of lobster, no, in Capital Grille style you will find like a whole claw!! And the cheese they use is a wonderful sharp cheddar and some other kind blended in that I couldn&#39;t distinguish. Oh, and they put these magnificent buttery bread crumbs in there too!!Trust me. This is some of the best Mac n cheese you will ever have.I have had other sides too that are also awesome, like the Brussel sprouts or the mashed potatoes. I don&#39;t believe there&#39;s one thing that&#39;s so-so on the menu.This place is also nice if you just want to hang out at the bar, watch some sports, and get wine and bread and oysters. It&#39;s a good break for something like that vs. just going to a local dive. Fancy it up man!!I highly recommend Capital Grille.

The lunch menu is $22.00. Not bad &amp; they offered 4 different entree selections. I ended up ordering from their regular lunch menu because I wanted a bone-in strip and it was reasonably priced for a 14oz lunch dish. It was served with mashed potatoes. The food was received rather quickly, maybe that&#39;s why my potatoes were luke warm (not hot as I prefer). My steak was perfectly cooked. It was more on the med side than med rare side as requested, but it was still very enjoyable. It was a nice decent size. I did have to add salt Â (doesn&#39;t seem like they use any). 4 of 5 on the food.Now on to the service, our server was Sue G. (I won&#39;t blast her last name, even though they provide cards with it). Sue was pleasant, she got the order correct, but she also didn&#39;t seem genuine and she seemed rather rushed &amp; kinda of curt w/us. I&#39;d give her 3 of 5 stars honestly.

On the house: shrimp cocktail and dessert flightSpicy Calamari: 3/5 it was spicier than expected. The peppers sprinkled it gave it a nice kick but the sauce made it soggier than I would like. I liked the flavors but not so much the texture.Porcini rubbed ribeye: 3/5 It was too charred for my taste giving it a burnt flavor that was contrasted by the slightly sour balsamic vinegar. Not my cup of tea. I&#39;m a purest, I just don&#39;t like overpowering rubs on my steak.Porterhouse: 5/5 This was my first time ordering a porterhouse and I didn&#39;t quite know what to expect. My first bite was kinda chewy and slightly dry and then I realized my porterhouse came out medium on one side and well done on the other. Seth, our server, quickly rectified the situation and brought me out a shrimp cocktail to nibble on while I waited. The next porterhouse had me in tears it was so good. It was cooked to perfection, just the right amount of char and perfectly medium rare. It was so tender and so juicy I was so excited and am converted.Lobster mac and cheese: 3/5 to be honest, I&#39;m not a lobster fan but I do love the flavor it imparts on carbs. The mac and cheese was good albeit skimpy on the lobster pieces. But for $18, we can&#39;t really expect a whole lobster I guess. The noodles and the breading had a good texture but the flavor was okay.Mashed potatoes: 4/5 holy butter and heavy cream batman! They were exactly the way mashed potatoes at a steakhouse should be: creamy, buttery and oh so bad for you. The perfect accouterment to steak. I wish it had another flavor mixed in there such as garlic.Shrimp cocktail: 5/5 My favorite dish of the night. That cocktail sauce is on point! I wanted to drink it, it was so good. The shrimp was perfectly cooked and was perfectly complimented by that delightful cocktail sauce.Birthday dessert flight: 4/5 blood orange sorbet, salted caramel gelato, berry compote, flourless chocolate cake with a sugarless whipped cream and creme brÃ»lÃ©e cheesecake. Hands down my favorite was the blood orange sorbet! I&#39;m not a sorbet person because it&#39;s usually too sweet but this was the perfect amount of sweetness contrasted by the tartness. The consistency was a little thicker than a slurpee so basically perfect. The salted caramel gelato melted fairly quickly and was pretty sweet. It had a nice flavor but sweeter than I typically enjoy in gelato. The strawberry and blueberry compote was delightful. The cheesecake was good but a little bit heavy tasting after steak. The texture was light and creamy. I&#39;m a not a chocolate eater so the flourless chocolate cake tasted like it always does? (I know I&#39;m terrible, who doesn&#39;t enjoy lobster and chocolate)Service: 6/5 starsI had noted on my reservation that it was my birthday and they decorated my table with rose petals and a signed happy birthday note. We had Seth as our server and he was attentive, nice and charming. He was really attentive and funny albeit slightly absentee (probably because he had tables in a different room). He quickly rectified my well porterhouse by quickly bringing me a shrimp cocktail while my dinner companion dined on his ribeye. That was an absolutely nice touch and I was pleasantly surprised! The manager brought out my new porterhouse and asked me to cut into it to make sure it was the correct temperature. He even went as far as to bring out new mashed potatoes to ensure I had a hot side to enjoy with my delicious steak. I was a little sad that they didn&#39;t clean the bread crumbs off the table and I was staring at my own mess the entire time.Ambiance: 3/5Looks like an old boys clubhouse, there was a giant painting of a random man on wall staring at me the entire night. The lighting is dim and the walls are wood if I remember correctly. Not a fan.I will definitely be back for my next special occasion.tl;dr pretty good steakhouse to visit if you don&#39;t want to make the trip into the city."the-capital-grille-lombard,Chrissy K.,u8oAEXTObXDf-10xp4lHMg,"Orland Park, IL",0,1,0,0,90,0JJxsaKwiTaCUrE2gi25tQ,5,30/10/16,"We&#39;ve been to the downtown location several times, but Saturday night was our first time here in Yorktown.

For instance, Wildfire in both Schaumburg and in Oakbrook has better filets. They are also cheaper.The plus side of this place is good service, good food, and amazing decor.

I had wanted to go to Capital Grille for a long time and I did so during Chicago Restaurant Week. We sat at a corner table in the lounge, right under a painting of Harry Caray. Also, right next to two screaming kids, but that&#39;s not on the restaurant. I liked that they had tablets on the table to select our wine options. I enjoyed a nice glass of Malbec for $10.The bread basket was nice, with different choices, although I got pretty hooked on those seeded rolls. I even asked for, and received, a couple of extras. The clam chowder was pretty solid, not too thick, not too thin. My companion was not overly impressed with the wedge salad as it was pretty small. The 18 ounce bone in strip with the Kona coffee crust and shallot butter was so mixed. The Kona seasoning was one of the best flavors I&#39;ve ever had on steak. Smoky, spicy, and sweet. I would buy that seasoning if I could. But we asked for medium-rare steaks and they both came out quite rare. Also, we weren&#39;t thrilled with having to choose between mashed potatoes and green beans; it would have been nice to have small portions of both instead.Dessert was really nice, I had an amazing creme brulee. The top shell wasn&#39;t overly crispy and hard, it blended nicely into the custard. the fresh berries on top were a nice accompaniment.

But the periods between visits could be lengthy. He actually seemed to take really good care of the table next to us who were seated a short while after us, so that was nice for them. My water glass sat empty for a while, but I watched the table next to us get half-empty glasses filled and the pitcher put away, before the server grabbed them something else. 10 minutes later or so, I was able to get some water too. It took us over 45 minutes from finishing our meal to getting our leftovers boxed and paying the bill, which I know because I watched the clocks on their wall with interest while we sat around waiting.Our neighbors received hot towel service at the end of their meal. I don&#39;t know, we weren&#39;t offered that. I guess I should be glad that I didn&#39;t have to start walking up to random employees trying to run my card so we could leave without dining and dashing.We weren&#39;t fussy about it at all, and it truly didn&#39;t get tiresome until that last long wait at the end of the meal.The food overall was good to great. Much as I love asparagus, I wasn&#39;t crazy with their take on it. We enjoyed our steaks, which were cooked to perfection. Â The martinis were good.

The rare tuna with mango and sriracha sauce was amazing, and I do not like sriracha. It was flavorful but subdued. My filet was cooked perfectly and the others in mg party enjoyed theirs as well. Out of our side dishes, my favorites were the lobster mac and cheese which used a very mild white cheddar, along with the soy sauce and bacon glazed brussel sprouts.

This past Friday we had reservations at Hugo Frog&#39;s in Des Plaines, but it started pouring rain right before we were about to leave and it was rush hour. We both decided that fighting the traffic wasn&#39;t going to be worth it, so as we were driving down Butterfield we had a sudden change of plans. We quickly opened up OpenTable and started seeing where we could get in immediately. The choices were The Capital Grille and Gibson&#39;s (pretty darn good choices). Since we&#39;ve been to Gibson&#39;s numerous times, we decided to give Capital Grille a go!As I said before, it was a rainy Friday night and it was still rather early, around 6pm or so. We were sat right away at a table tucked back in the corner. There were several open tables, but they must have been reserved, because we were pushed into the corner. We&#39;re not really picky about seating, but it was a bit crammed.Our server came right away and went over drinks (on an iPad). The bread was warm and delicious and the drinks were reasonably priced and delicious.We ordered Lobster/Crab Cakes as an appetizer and they were absolutely wonderful. This is our goto and we certainly were not disappointed.For the main course I ordered the 10oz Filet and my FiancÃ© went with the Seared Tenderloin with Lobster Tails. We also went with asparagus and au gratin potatoes as sides.My Filet was a bit undercooked, but still very good. Her tenderloin was VERY undercooked and she really didn&#39;t enjoy it much, especially for the price. She did however enjoy the lobster tails, she said those were delicious. The asparagus was good, but not great. And the au gratin potatoes were not very good at all.In total, we ordered a bottle of wine and two of their higher end menu items with two sides. The bill came out to about $250, not including tip. It was a very average meal, and I&#39;d certainly pick Gibson&#39;s, Hugo&#39;s, or Joe&#39;s over this if I had to do it again."the-capital-grille-lombard,Beena C.,z3DuK3RXzL8BFDaT5lehFQ,"Oak Park, IL",0,1,0,0,32,wWc2qsYzeIPkbODFKt63Gg,3,07/06/16,"This is my favorite restaurant.

On to the food: I had the tuna tartare as the appetizer and the scallops as the main course. The tuna was amazing, my favorite thing about the meal. The scallops...well, they were good and the mushroom risotto was very good but a couple of the scallops had a bit of grittiness, like they weren&#39;t rinsed enough. This was the only thing a bit off. My husband loved the French onion soup and his porterhouse steak which was cooked perfectly.

The bartender was really nice. When we went to the dining area for dinner, our waitress was very helpful and super friendly. All 4 of us really liked her and the service she provided to us. Her name is Lindsey Glosniak and when we go next time, we&#39;re definitely going to ask for her! Her service and explanation of the menu to us was excellent!We started out with the grand plateau. This was a delicious appetizer. Two tiers of seafood. The bottom tier was of shrimp and oysters. The top tier was of lobster and crab. Really enjoyed it. We thought it was going to be a lot of food, but we devoured it. For entree I ordered the porcini delmonico steak. My boss ordered that, too. One co worker ordered the gorgonzola and truffle steak, and another ordered the porterhouse steak. The porterhouse steak is 24oz. Our delmonico steak is 22oz, and the gorgonzola and truffle steak is 14oz. It was so much steak! Most of Â us didn&#39;t finish it, and they gave it to me to take home for the leftovers which still tasted good after reheating it in the oven. The flavor and texture was just like how it was when it came out the night after. We ended the night with creme Â brulee and coconut pie to share with the table.

However, things would have been a little easier with just a regular wine/cocktail menu that we could read before the server comes over. Also, when we were seated, we didn&#39;t receive the &#34;Ipad&#34; drink menu, so when the server came over to ask us what we wanted to drink, we had to ask for the drink menu. She looked at us like something was wrong with us; I guess she couldn&#39;t believe that we didn&#39;t know the &#34;Ipad&#34; drink menu by heart. Then, it took her about 10 - 15 minutes to bring us the &#34;Ipad&#34; drink menu, which, of course, made our dining experience longer than it should have been.Again, the food is excellent.

Breakfast consisted of serviceable scrambled eggs and Lyonnaise pan-fried potatoes, but very nicely cooked and flavorful bacon, sausage, pancakes, and French toast. We didn&#39;t partake of the raw bar, but it included smoked salmon, shrimp, and oysters.The lunch buffet items included mac and cheese that was not very cheesy but surprisingly delicious, creamy and well-seasoned mashed potatoes, and citrus glazed salmon and roast chicken that were both decent but not the stars of the show. That honor goes to the kona-rubbed tenderloin steak: I can&#39;t stress enough that this is what you want to save your valuable gastric real estate for- I would have spent the entire price of entry just for this dish (which is exactly what you&#39;d pay to order it off the menu any other time). The seasoning on this coffee-crusted meat is so unique and unexpected, and the tenderness was absolutely perfect at either level of doneness I had (I tried it at medium and medium rare). They also had ham at the carving station which was fine, but once you try the steak you&#39;ll regret giving up that bit of space for something lesser.We also ordered several items from the kitchen: a cheese omelette (ever so slightly runny, but still good), cheeseburger sliders (very good), and truffle fries (also very good). That being said, just try that kona steak- you really won&#39;t be as happy with anything else.The dessert table was an enormous surprise, as I&#39;ve been consistently underwhelmed with buffet desserts- while usually pretty to look at, they just aren&#39;t usually that tasty. The espresso flourless chocolate cake was the clear winner here, but the brÃ»lÃ©e cheesecake and key lime pie bites (seemed more like key lime cheesecake) were fantastic, as well. They also had cream puffs, cake pops, chocolate cookies, and a variety of cupcakes, but just don&#39;t waste the space on these.The Capital Grille appears to exude class in all things, from the hostess to the bartender and waiter, from the restaurant decor to the rose petals on the table- highly enjoyable and worth the price of admission.That steak."the-capital-grille-lombard,Courtney H.,g3pUQClm1XCXiYSwsJElfQ,"Shorewood, IL",1,1,0,67,12,7AdXFRfQYBbhQ8l4uv2I8A,5,02/01/15,"Again, cannot go wrong with this place. We made a reservation for New Year&#39;s Eve back at the beginning of November and let me tell you, this place was PACKED. We got there a little early and were seated right away.The bread basket always provides a wide variety of choices and is delicious. I got the smoked salmon appetizer as a starter and I&#39;ve said it before, but it&#39;s one of the best things I have EVER eaten. I then got the filet, cooked well done and it was perfect. I shared the twice baked potato with my mom, they actually cut it into 3 pieces which was nice. Brussel Sprouts were amazing, but I actually didn&#39;t like the bacon that came with it. The pieces were huge and fatty. I know it&#39;s for flavor, but still.I was too stuffed for dessert, but I will try to get back here again soon!"the-capital-grille-lombard,Roz C.,BecTz6E1wpdpelHFocxX9Q,"Westmont, IL",0,1,0,0,3,LDxWe-J6gvRZKK7-XpebDQ,5,26/03/16,"We went here for our anniversary last year and while the service was excellent, the food was only okay. We really enjoy dining out and while service can definitely make or break a review, we thought the food just didn&#39;t justify better than a 3 star rating. There was nothing wrong with our steaks, they were cooked well, but they seemed to be lacking some seasoning. We actually preferred the steaks at Wildfire, which I feel are always seasoned well and cooked exactly right. The sides weren&#39;t very memorable either. I&#39;m not sure if perhaps it was just an off night? As I said, the service was wonderful--a table was set up with rose petals and our server took a souvenir photo for us, which was a very thoughtful gesture. The complementary dessert WAS delicious, though, and very much appreciated!

I drink my desert, so no input there except I highly recommend a Moscow Mule since it balances out a heavy meal perfectly. The atmosphere is definitely a well healed drinkers country club.

I&#39;ve never had anything even remotely close to it. They always cook it perfectly. Sides are ala carte which is not unusual for a steakhouse. The mashed potatoes are wonderful. My husband is a fan of the shrooms.The appetizers are also great. They have a seafood tower - seriously who doesn&#39;t like a seafood tower? But the best of all are the shrimp. They are large - they are fresh - they are great.Our favorite dessert is the CrÃ¨me Brulee cheesecake. The crust is made from Nilla Wafers. Yes, Nilla Wafers.

Â One star missing because it&#39;s a bit overpriced.Food- Started off with the assortment of fresh bread. Â It came with flat pita and sourdough which didn&#39;t try, but I did try the pumpernickel rye and baked onion bread, both of which were great. Â I got the baked Â French onion soup, and my dad got the spinach salad with bacon dressing. Â I didn&#39;t try the salad, but the baked French onion soup was delicious. Â I really liked that they maintained the consistency of the bread, because usually when I order French onion soup, the bread is all soggy and gross. Â For sides we got the creamed spinach and au gratin potatoes. Â The creamed spinach was delicious, very creamy, but not to bitter and not to rich. Â The potatoes were also great, also creamy and extremely rich(which is good). For dinner I had the porterhouse and my dad had the kona crusted steak. Â The porterhouse was perfect. Â One side was a juicy strip that made me feel like a real man eating it, and the other a finer filet, with just the right fat content to give it that melt in your mouth flavor. Â My dads kona steak was pretty good, but I&#39;m not a big fan of the kona rub, it tastes a little too charred to me.Service- The service was fantastic. Â Came in at five on Saturday and sat right down. Â Our waitress was terrific, constantly refilling drinks and actual had a decent conversation with us. Â The 3-4 managers all checked in with us periodically to make sure all was well.Definitely would come back for a special occasion, but a bit too expensive for a normal weekend dinner."the-capital-grille-lombard,Jj O.,4UQReaNNu5wSJs_IzSxeng,"Upper East Side, Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,40,18,y1ukAGzQ9Rf-AeooVbzmsw,4,27/09/15,"I am one of the only people that does not order steak here.

Thee friendliest, thee ambiance, thee service, especially thee food!I&#39;ve been to this location a handful of times and always received impeccable service! I always had a mind set that a great restaurant would never let their customers water glass go below half and at CG it never does! Constantly refilled, napkins refolded upon our return from the bathroom, servers constantly checks up on us and bussers quickly clearing our plates. Outstanding!My most recent visit was for Chicago Restaurant Week (CG is ALWAYS on my list for the week) and it was just the same as I had experience before. We were sat before our entire party arrived and our server patiently waited while they did. The CRW menu was similar to year&#39;s prior, but that&#39;s perfectly fine because before I sat down I knew I what I would get.We all shared the fried calamari with hot peppers, crunchy with a kick! Most of us had the creamy, perfectly seasoned, clam chowder. Then my favorite of all time: the bone-in kona (yelp.com/biz_photos/the-â€_) - I don&#39;t know how to describe this amazing piece of red meat, it&#39;s delicious, cooked to perfection, juicy, tender, packed with flavor, orgasmic, by far the best steak I&#39;ve ever had! I&#39;ve also got to try their glazed salmon (yelp.com/biz_photos/the-â€_) and I wish I could take home CG&#39;s chefs. The salmon was moist, flavorful, and just down right delicious! Yum yum yum! My fellow first timers all raved about their dishes and couldn&#39;t wait for dessert.I went with their homemade vanilla ice cream while majority of the group had the creme brulee, we&#39;re big on sharing so I did the smart thing of eating my ice cream with the creme brulee and I was in heaven! The combination of the 2 hit the sweet spot, yum. The creme brulee was so delicious my cousin left no evidence behind!

Â The service provided by our waitress was fantastic! Â Let me go back to the beginning, though. Â I made reservations using open table, which is very convenient. Â The restaurant called a day ahead to confirm the reservations, which gave me the opportunity to change the number of people in the party since someone was being a brat and decided not to come out for a nice dinner celebration, but that&#39;s neither here nor there.We showed up pretty much on time, if not a few minutes early, but our table wasn&#39;t ready. Â The hostess said someone would come get us from the bar area when it&#39;s ready. Â It was good that there were a fair amount of stools to sit and wait by the bar area. Â After about 20 minutes, we started to become hungry and concerned, so I went to inquire about our table. Â The hostess said someone will show us the way now, but now took another 10 minutes since the hostess also doubled as the coat check attendant and was bombarded with a bunch of people coming and going.Yes, not a good start to the dinner, but a good dinner made up for the late seating. Â The menu has the standard offerings of a typical steakhouse - steaks, chicken, and seafood. Â There were also a few specials that the waitress rattled off at the beginning. Â I went with the rib eye special, which I was a little disappointed in since the steak was not as tasty as I&#39;ve hope it would have been. Â I did try a sampling of other people&#39;s steak, like the sirloin, which was very good. Â Everything else was very good - the calamari, oysters, Parmesan truffle fries, grilled asparagus...I had a dirty martini, which was well made.The sides are large are meant to be shared with the table, averages about $10. Â Main course are about $20-50. Â They offer a few wine by the glass, half bottles and an extensive list of full bottles. Â We ended up spending almost $400 for dinner for 4, including alcohol, which was on par compared to the other upscale steakhouses.We were so stuffed by the end that we didn&#39;t order any desserts. Â The waitress surprised us with a serving of crÃ¨me brulee on the house - and it was amazing! Â Yes, even though we were stuffed to the brim, there was not a speck of crÃ¨me left when we were done."the-capital-grille-lombard,Zach G.,DSpFOTOSCAh3LEv3L1fPPQ,"Olathe, KS",1,1,1,171,29,zvNcZmEFAdwR_vg6vjNGiA,4,29/04/14,"After several great experiences in the Kansas City Captial Grille location, my wife and I found ourselves unexpectedly in the Chicago suburbs, where I grew up, for our first anniversary. Considering we went to CG in Kansas City the night we got engaged, and our one week wedding anniversary, we decided we should do the one year at CG too. Of course, it was a great choice. This review is of a Saturday evening.This location, aesthetics wise, isn&#39;t as good as the Kansas City location, which has many smaller rooms off to the sides. This location only has one or two, leaving a larger central dining room that feeds off of the kitchen and gets very loud. Luckily, we were in one of the smaller rooms so it wasn&#39;t as bad, but the sound from the main area did pour in a bit. Also, it seems quite a bit smaller than the Kansas City location, but that could be a result of the layout.We had 5:15pm reservations, but had to switch them to 8:00pm last minute. The lady on the phone wasn&#39;t the friendliest when I called to do this, but she did it nonetheless. We showed up at 7:30pm and were seated immediately. Our server, whose name I forget off the top of my head, was a bit aloof and spacy at first, but got better as the meal went along. In the end, we really liked him quite a lot; at the beginning, we weren&#39;t quite sure. It&#39;s the guy in the photo bomb picture here on Yelp, I think ;)I ordered a Chopin martini with bleu cheese olives. They always make these great at CG, and this was no exception. My wife ordered some kind of martini, I forget which, with a house made pineapple vodka. Good, but I liked mine better. She liked hers better...We ordered the oysters, for which you get four for $13. This is where the price difference with Kansas City really starts showing - in KC you get six for $15. These oysters were very small, and only okay. Based on where they came from, I expected a brinier taste, but they really weren&#39;t as briny as I had hoped based on what our waiter had told us.For the mains, I got the 22oz Delmonico, medium rare. My wife got the 10oz filet, medium rare. They both came out cooked perfectly, and my god...delicious. Not that I expected any less, but I had never had a bone-in beef steak at CG before, only filet&#39;s and lamb, and I was just flabbergasted by how delicious it was. My wife&#39;s filet was awesome, also. I liked mine better. She liked hers better. I see a trend ;)For sides, we got half orders of (a) spinach, and (b) mashed potatoes. They were both good, but nothing extraordinary. The spinach, especially, was no better than what I cook at home. But it is hard to do too much special to spinach.As a result of our anniversary, we got champagne and delicious dessert at the end. In Kansas City, they seem to give the champagne immediately (at the beginning of your time, even before appetizers), so I prefer how Lombard does it - with dessert.All in all, the total for 2x martini&#39;s, 1x oyster, 1x Delmonico, 1x filet, 1/2x potatoes, and 1/2x spinach was $153. Really, a great price (but we did get dessert free, and didn&#39;t order salads...still had tons of food). I&#39;m giving it 5 stars, but I&#39;d say it&#39;s more like 4.5 rounded up."the-capital-grille-lombard,Ray M.,8LzELwwCUQn0IeRKRbWJFQ,"Northeast, Minneapolis, MN",0,1,0,0,48,NjodRMwjsxNM5wqv5UYxog,4.5,20/05/15,"I couldn&#39;t have wished for a better experience! I planned a surprise birthday dinner from out of town and they were more than helpful in every aspect. It was a Monday night and they allowed us to make a reservation for 17 people. When we arrived I saw that we DID get a private room, so it must have been available. This was so appreciated and came in handy since a big group can be loud! They decorated the table with flowers for the birthday boy and gave a complimentary huge piece of cake for him as well. He said it was the best birthday he&#39;d had in a long time.Our server Niko or Nikko(sp?) was tremendous. He was very attentive and took pictures for us and everything. Very kind and helpful.The food was great as well! Although it is pricey, it was expected. They sent me a menu with prices upon request beforehand. Great place!

Knowing that this is a chain steak house, I was expecting huge cuts of meat, that weird thing where they bring out slabs of raw beef to show off the dinner options (they don&#39;t do that here, FYI), and leaving stuffed but feeling like I&#39;d shelled out about $75 more than I should have for a nice dinner.Luckily, I was pleasantly surprised. Â Yes, there are a lot of the typical steak house features at Capital Grille, but their extra touches make this a special place to dine. First, the staff really wants to help you celebrate if you are coming for an occasion. Â We were asked upon phone reservation, at the hostess desk, and by our waiter if we had anything to celebrate today. Â Even though we were just celebrating a nice evening together, as we saw around the restaurant, they go out of their way to decorate the table, sign a card, and take a photo of the group who is celebrating. Â This is such a great gesture as so many restaurants know their patrons have a birthday, graduation, or anniversary, but do nothing extra to make the even memorable.Anyway, our waiter was friendly, knowledgeable, and had excellent timing. Â We told him we weren&#39;t sure what to order since we didn&#39;t want huge portions of meat, so he suggested we split a salad, a steak, and a side. This obviously results in a much lower check than two adults ordering two entrees, so I was surprised that he offered to split an entree for us without an additional plate charge. Â We ended up with the Cobb salad, the Kona-rubbed steak, and the lobster mac. Â All of these were exceptional, well cooked, and completely satisfying. Â We had just the right amount of food and enjoyed a few cocktails and a relaxing pace without the food coming out at top speed. Desserts looked tempting, but we decided to pass since we were completely full. Â After the waiter came back to take our check, he asked us to wait another minute. Â He came back with a complimentary cheesecake to go! Just like the attention to celebrating occasions, another nice touch to show a little extra care towards the guests.This is one of the few times I&#39;ve eaten out and felt like I received more than I expected in quality and customer service. Â Yes, this is an expensive meal for a special splurge, but I&#39;ll be back."the-capital-grille-lombard,Danny M.,NRE3T9Floim2P6q0ymfUWw,"Chicago, IL",1,1,1,121,9,g0CayfQLsMwneWygkxbeTQ,5,07/02/13,"This is my second consecutive year coming here for restaurant week and it still hits the spot. Though I am located closer to the downtown location, I like coming here more because they have parking. (A few years ago I went to the downtown location for my bday and it was extremely hard to find parking).Last year I got the Filet Mignon, which was amazing, but this year I decided to try the Bone-in Kona for my main entree. I like this a little more than the Filet Mignon and it was cooked the way we asked for it. You also get vegetables and mash potatoes to complement the steak, which is a perfect blend. The green beans were my favorite! I also had the Clam Chowder, which was good, but I definitely had better. Lastly, I end the night with Strawberry Sorbet, which was really really good! Definitely come here for restaurant week if you haven&#39;t already!The service was top notch as always and our waiter Jason was extremely friendly and funny.

Throughout our meal, we were serviced several times by wait staff to refill water or remove dirty dishes.While our food was delicious, the inattentiveness of the waiter, the lack of any mention of my husband&#39;s birthday/dessert, and the over $600 bill, make it highly unlikely that we will return.

I&#39;ve left G&amp;G&#39;s, Del Frisco&#39;s, Gibson&#39;s, Chop House, Bones (in Atlanta), STK, etc. with very positive feelings about the food, but not the feeling that it was the best steak I&#39;ve ever had.

I mixed the sweet with the traditional BBQ sauce, and it was pretty good.I was disappointed that there was no ice in the soda machine.

Tried the marinated Chicken Breast, which wasn&#39;t smoked, wasn&#39;t BBQ, however the Italian flavor profile pleased albeit a bit dry. Their pulled pork went over well enough also; however, aridity seemed to have become an all too common similarity. Top of the class for the three meat combo was the beef brisket, but by any other BBQ standards, it was mediocre and comparable to any franchise you&#39;ll find in the Chicagoland area. Being &#34;smoked to perfection&#34; would seem to indicate obvious requirements, e.g. bark, smoke ring; however, none were had. As for their house BBQ sauces (similar to their meats), not a one shined, and the concept of bland echoed. Their &#34;sweet&#34; sauce was fair, but nothing I&#39;d purchase in-store and bring home to the fam. Sides of barbeque beans were burnt and tasted of cigarette ash, seasoning was non-existent in the high school cafeteria lunch-lady land macaroni and cheese, and the slices of complimentary pickles and raw onions had no bearing (and no place, utterly stupid) on my aluminum cafeteria combo tray.

Â Then the manager took out a couple of ribs, put BBQ sauce on them, and took them to the father. Â The father said those were much better. Â Why wouldn&#39;t they all be the same???Fourth, do something about the buns. I don&#39;t know if they were old, just too big for the amount of meat, but something was just Â &#34;off&#34; Â with the bun.We had the chopped brisket which was very tender and it came with 2 sides. Â We ordered the Saturday special and not one person asked what we wanted to drink.. The special comes with 2 sides AND a drink. We left with no beverage.Believe the sign that says Â &#34;Order here&#34;. Â Even though you cannot see a person that takes orders, stand on your tippy toes and look over the very tall counter. Voila.Needs work, but the food is tasty, at least what we had to eat was tasty."dickeys-barbecue-pit-downers-grove,Courtney G.,XptCaGLCYdfw3xzl2lEkPQ,"Plainfield, IL",0,1,0,0,95,ZC9dvftWbeumtqh3mO3Dlw,3,28/08/16,"Decided to try this place since we were craving good ole bbq.

The menu said the waffle fries came with a seasoning on them, they didn&#39;t have anything on them. The only good item out of the 5 we ordered were the baked beans.

One last thing, their free ice cream. It tastes VERY synthetic. It has a fake vanilla flavor to it, I couldnt figure it out. Wasnt terrible, just didnt taste natural.

What a huge let down. I have tried this place 3 times....and now I am done. First time was when they just opened...the rib tips were great, place was clean, service was excellent. A bit pricey, but I thought it was worth it. Second time...last week...my daughter picked up my 1/2 order of ribs and brought them to work for me. It was jerky...hard, dried out...unbelievably salty...threw them away and called. The manager Laura was really nice, apologized and said I could come in and get a replacement dinner on the house. So I did...last night. Yuck... the ribs were so salty I could feel my blood pressure rising. And not very tender either. Woke up this morning with my hands swollen and stomach cramps.

I had won a free meal prize from a blog I follow. I have to admit I had never even heard of them before and didn&#39;t even know there was this location in DG before the giveaway. It&#39;s not the best location but they make it work. Now we received the XL family pack, 3 meats (1lb each) , 4 sides and 8 rolls plus pickles, onions and the sauce on the side. Let me tell you it can feed the family of 4 - 6 quite nicely. We only have the 2 of us so we stretched it to 2 meals easily. Rolls were very basic but not to hard and great for mopping up sauce, pickles were sweet and tasty. Sauce was sweet but not to much, not to salty, had a little bit of a kick. I liked it. We tried the onion tangles which were a generous portion seasoned nicely not to salty, and not to skinny either, they were great when mixed in with the meat. The waffle fries that were dusted with a great seasoning and perfectly cooked not to soft and not overly crunchy. Mac n cheese was very basic just noodles and cheese. Good but could be better. Â Plus the baked potato casserole which is just mashed potatoes with bacon cheese and green onions on top. Really tasty comfort food here. Moving onto the meat we got the pulled pork and beef. They were both tender, moist, smokey with a slight after kick which we both loved. Even great the next day even before we warmed it back up. Plus the ribs. They were fall of the bone and delicious. Moist and decent amount of meat. Atmosphere in the restaurant is quaint and has character. Staff is very nice and helpful. Not a huge eating area, but would recommend for lunch or just ordering for carry-out. Simple but great choice menu. Was not paid for my review all thoughts and feelings are my own and just like going out of my way to recognize a great place like this one.

We felt they were smaller than most other BBQ options. Also, all our plates had included the heel or very tough parts of the cut of meat. I guess that there are others that might enjoy these parts of the result, but they were larger than I expected, and were not enjoyable.

Â What a terrible experience. Â Despite the food being positively superb, the service was the worst I&#39;ve ever experienced anywhere. Â The word &#34;pit&#34; in their name is certainly well-deserved. Â I placed an online order. Â I chose the time &#34;right now,&#34; and it instructed me to leave right away. Â When I got there (I even took my time getting there), I went to the &#34;online order&#34; pickup counter and was told (by another customer) that there was a line (for online order pickups). Â Three people were in front of me. Â None of the orders were ready. Â Other people who were coming in placing orders, were getting their food before us. Â 25 damn minutes later, it was &#34;my turn&#34; and the owner informed me that they were out of ribs (one of the three dinners I ordered), that there would be a half-hour (more) wait (unless I changed the order). Â I changed the ribs to pulled-pork, which he said was &#34;ready.&#34; Â That took an additional 15 minutes to pack. Â It seemed like nobody back there knows how to run a restaurant proper. Â They were having all sorts of issues. Â I thought maybe they were having a bad night, but the cashier said that it&#39;s been like that ever since they opened (three weeks ago). Â What a shame. Â The food here was so good that this could easily have become my favorite BBQ place (or at least nearest favorite). Â It&#39;s right down the street from where I live, and I hate the long drive all the way to Baby Back Blues in Plainfield every time I get a hankering for BBQ (though I&#39;m always delighted afterwards). Â Damn. Â They either ought to learn how to run the place or sell it to someone who can. Â They deserve one star (because that&#39;s the lowest I can go), but I&#39;ll give &#39;em 2... just on HOPE that they can get their act together.

The staff seemed lost and could not coordinate with each other. The prices are not Subway style, they were higher in fact, and the sides were average.

First of all, it&#39;s a very small place and as soon as you walk in, there&#39;s a smell of fried food combined with a musty odor so we were not very pleased upon going in. Not to mention, there&#39;s a sign by the door for everyone to leave their strollers outside (what if it&#39;s raining??!) The person behind the counter didn&#39;t seem very happy to be there either - very serious. We ordered 3 tacos of chicken, 3 of steak, and 3 of chorizo, as well as a jarrito and horchata. The total came out to almost $30. The chicken tacos were okay but we liked that they were soft and shredded for my son to eat. The steak was a bit chewy but this happens often with tacos. The chorizo was the best one in my opinion. The horchata was good too - not too sweet.

More than good! AND, they offered carnitas tacos which not many places do. I also got an al pastor taco which also far exceeded my expectations. Both were very good...not greasy nor fatty meats which is hard to come by at most taco joints. They also weren&#39;t skimpy on the meat. Rice and beans were good. Rice had a nice flavor, wasn&#39;t bland like most places too.Place is intimate, but has a nice sit down area. It&#39;s kind of out of the way for me, but it would definitely be worth a trip if I wanted some good tacos in the burbs.

Â There&#39;s street parking and they are next to a parking lot as well.When you walk in, it&#39;s a cozy little space. Â A few tables of four and a couple of 2 seater tables on the side of the wall. Â They have a flat screen TV and plants along their huge front window display. Â You just come in place your order and have a seat.They give your free warm chips and 2 types of salsa, the red is REALLY hot for my taste.They serve Mexican or American style dishes. Â Mexican is: onions and cilantro. Â American is: lettuce, tomato, and cheese.They have meat options such as: Steak, Ground Beef, Shredded Chicken, Al Pastor, Carnitas, Chorizo, Fish.They also offer Vegetarian Options: Avocado, Chile Relleno, Cheese, Cheese &amp; Onion, Fajita VeggiesThey even serve breakfast all day!If you look at their menu, they also make your typical Hot dogs Burgers, and Gyros to accommodate everyone&#39;s palate!And don&#39;t forget desserts too if you plan to stay longer, lol!It was nice that the owner took the time to chit chat with us on how our meals were. Â He said that they will even try to accommodate of your order.Now on to the food:-Chimichanga; my friend enjoyed it, she got steak and the fixins. Â It&#39;s a pretty nice size, that she ended up taking some home. Â Deep-fried crispy and golden brown, with Mexican rice and beans. Â She said the sides were ok.-I tried their Al Pastor corned taco, Mexican style. Â It was flavorful and well-seasoned.-I ordered what I came here for...their Carne Asada Fries! Â Even a guy who was picking up his order, said yeah you&#39;ll really like they dish, it&#39;s good!It&#39;s a pretty big portion that you can share as an appetizer or have it as a meal. Â The fresh cut fries were still hot and crispy with grilled tender steak, onions, and cilantro. Topped with salsa verde, fresh guacamole, cheese, grilled red bell peppers, sour cream, and lime wedges. Â So refreshing with all the different layers, apparently this is a popular dish in California and this is my first time trying it. Â Both my foodie friend and my friend who I went here (are Cali gals) stated it taste and looked good. Â I&#39;d get this again.I enjoyed the conversations with the owners, very nice people the &#34;Muse&#34; we called the lady in front of the house with that cute maroon hair and the chef behind the counter. Â He gets his inspiration all over the place and brought the Carne Asada Fries idea straight from California!-To end the night here, we ate a dessert of a nice platter of fried chips covered in cinnamon sugar and served with chocolate syrup and topped with whipped cream.

The steak gordita came in a handmade tortilla that was stuff with steak with the option of cilantro and onions or lettuce and tomato.

I do like the chicken... it tastes good. However, it also kind of scares me because I can&#39;t tell if it&#39;s cooked all the way sometimes.

The man preparing the food was also really nice - I suspect he was Alfredo himself, but I can&#39;t say for sure.The food came out quickly, and when offered a choice of salsas (in squeeze bottles) I opted for both the red and green (I really enjoyed the latter, though the red was fine).Now the food: both my steak and chicken tacos were a little under seasoned for my taste. With a little salt, they were good. The poblano pepper was tasty, though i chewed into a couple of bits of stem while eating it. I enjoyed the refried beans quite a bit. So all in all, the food was good, but not great.This is really a 3.5 star review rounded up to a 4 based on how genuinely nice the staff were. I really would like to see them succeed, as we need as many mom and pop Mexican restaurants in the world as possible.

This is a &#34;city food&#34; kinda place, which are my favorites! They have gyros, Mexican food, burgers, hot dogs, Phillies, etc. I&#39;d say 1/2 their menu is Mexican, and the other is everything else. It was Cinco de Mayo, so we had to do something Mexican.CARNE ASADA FRIESImagine getting Carne Asada Nachos at a real Mexican taqueria (not Taco Bell), and then replace the chips with french fries. Voila, you have Carne Asada Fries. SO, discarding the fact that french fries and Mexican flavors don&#39;t mix (at least not for me), part of the genius behind tortilla chips is that you can scoop all that Nacho-y goodness because of the shape. A french fry is a stick! You&#39;re not gonna scoop anything with a stick! So you have to pretty much eat it with a fork. I really didn&#39;t really get a lot of flavor with the asada and the combination was forgettable.TACOSThe steak wasn&#39;t all that great or flavorful (like the Asada Fries), so they didn&#39;t lend too much here either. They were acceptable tacos, just nothing to write home about. Al Pastor was definitely better than Asada, but they were still pretty weak. Not enough flavor, not enough seasoning. Again, perfectly acceptable taco, but nothing special. Al Pastor - go to Los Fernandez in Schaumburg. Al Pastor -- go to King Taco in LA.CHILE RELLENOI was worried it was going to be a tiny thin poblano, but no, it&#39;s a good size and wide pepper. I know they&#39;re not supposed to be spicy, but this one never even dreamed of spice! The cheese inside, though, was very welcomed, and, although not spicy, it did have a slight enough poblano flavor to mix with that chihuahua cheese. They serve tortillas with it, but I don&#39;t use them.CHORIZO QUESADILLAMy friend discovered this at America&#39;s Bar (yes...a bar) and it was so amazing. I could go into a whole dissertation about chorizo but I&#39;ll spare you the excitement. For these quesadillas to work, though, you have to have the right amount of crisp, and the right amount of greasy. Alfredo&#39;s did not. The chorizo was not flavorful, but more like, down and out. Definitely wasn&#39;t greasy, but thankfully, it wasn&#39;t dry either. Very forgettable and not worth money, even though it is pretty cheap.TAMALEServed in a corn husk, but it was much drier than I&#39;ve had before. It wasn&#39;t as dry as you can get without being crispy or crunchy. My tongue and tonsils were shriveling up! I needed to douse it with...HORCHATAAnything sugary is going to be good, and here is no different, but as far as Horchatas go, they were lacking. It tasted like sweetened milk, which is about 75% of the way there, but you gotta have that cinnamon flavor to it. That&#39;s what it was missing, and so it fails as an horchata...but it&#39;s still sweet so I liked it!BLAH-QUERIAEven though pointswise, it is definitely a 2 star place (2.3), I feel bad about it. Nothing really tasted bad (except maybe the Tamale), but 2 almost seems like they&#39;re serving sewage, but really, it&#39;s not that bad. You could do a lot worse...but you could also do a lot....LOT better....And I REALLY don&#39;t get the hype about the carne asada fries."alfredos-taqueria-downers-grove,Marc H.,15mP6TLA5l5hNn1_zw_O-g,"Downers Grove, IL",0,1,0,0,46,57h5iYTiVcG5WnqM8WFTWQ,2,10/04/15,"I love the food, great steak burritos and the carne asada fries are excellent.

I must admit upon walking in I thought I was visiting a place called Boagies, I discovered that this place was Boagies and now is Alfredo&#39;s Taqueria. In taking a look around I noticed a few comfortable tables and chairs. It&#39;s small but comfortable inside.I came in and decided to try the hot dog and fries they offer. At only 2.99 this wasn&#39;t a bad deal. My food was ready shortly and the very polite gentleman made small talk with me while I waited for the food to be prepared. First off, let me go over the hot dog.The hot dog was on a poppy seed style bun, the bun was soft and had just the right texture. The hot dog itself appeared to be a standard skinless dog but was well heated and tasted fine. The pickles included were strange and had a slightly different flavor than your usual Chicago style pickle spear. I&#39;d describe this as somewhere between cucumber slices and a regular pickle. The hot peppers weren&#39;t too hot and were a nice compliment. The relish was well applied as was the mustard. I didn&#39;t detect any celery salt on this hot dog, and there were nice thinly sliced pieces of tomato on the hot dog itself. Overall this is a pretty good representation of what a Chicago style hot dog should be, and outside of the strange pickle and lack of celery salt this would have been a four star dog.The fries included weren&#39;t quite as good as the dog. These were fairly typical fresh cut fries, these didn&#39;t seem to be particularly salty or overcooked, but they just didn&#39;t have a lot of flavor. For those who have read my many other reviews of hot dog stands, I generally am not a fan of fresh cut fries, and these were no exception.Overall I liked my food at Alfredo&#39;s Taqueria and would definitely visit again. The friendly staff and cozy environment were nice. While I wouldn&#39;t necessarily get the dog and fries again, I&#39;d definitely be willing to try a burrito, taco or something else as that seems to be more of their specialty."alfredos-taqueria-downers-grove,Jennifer P.,sJG5XAGxlyzTyYCkp1Fj0Q,"Downers Grove, IL",0,1,0,0,17,omN9cKZqmWb4AKtz1UYsRA,4,13/08/15,"Mexican Food is good, but not worth the wait.

Â The flavor is amazing."alfredos-taqueria-downers-grove,Sidu C.,dH1wjd4B51iqWSjCQpQaRQ,"San Antonio, TX",0,1,1,1,8,KG5ySmtUQYt88zJBJ40VYQ,5,21/11/11,"This restaurant not only offers food for my stomach but also for my soul.Due to work I had to temporarily live around Downers Grove area. I had gotten tired of other &#34;Mexican&#34; restaurants and their crappy Americanized food until I saw a sign on Main Street in downtown Downers Grove selling tamales, pozole, and esquites. I decided to give it a try, and it is one risk I was glad to take.First of all, Alfredo&#39;s menu accurately marks the Americanized Mexican food and separates it from the real Mexican food. Don&#39;t get me wrong; I&#39;m sure their Americanized Mexican food is great and would please the palate of anyone who craves it or likes it. However, as a Mexican I grow tired of eating Americanized Mexican food such as burritos or tacos filled up with non traditional Mexican ingredients (such as yellow cheddar cheese or sour cream), finding a place where they serve the real deal was like finding a treasure. Â Alfredo&#39;s offers the best chile rellenos and pozole I&#39;ve had in the area. They also offer the soft tacos with cilantro and cebolla (as I said before, they also have the American version with lettuce, tomato, and sour cream), sopes, and tortas. Their tortillas are fresh and made out of corn!Another positive aspect is their service. Alfredo, the owner, and his parents are the servers and cooks there. So they are very careful and helpful and make you feel you are at home. They speak Spanish and English fluently, and keep you good company if you go there by yourself and want to chat a little. Â Alfredo&#39;s mom cooks a great soup that tastes &#34;home made&#34;; and I guess it&#39;s literally that flavor since it is the one she cooked when they were living in Mexico.The restaurant decorations and atmosphere are also Â great. What I like about them is that although Alfredo brought some decorations from Mexico that make the place look a little stereotypical of what and American expects of a Mexican restaurant, they are unique (not the typical piÃ±ata hanging there). They also left much of the older restaurant bringing out the American culture.It is very clean and pretty. The bathrooms are always clean and attended (toilet paper, paper towels). The view from inside is calming. There is a huge flat screen on the corner but it is not too loud. I&#39;m not sure if there is background music, but one day I needed to study there and they turned everything off so I could finish my work (I was grateful for that - there were no other clients at that moment).Since I found it I&#39;ve been there 5 times. I will miss it when I go back to my home town."alfredos-taqueria-downers-grove,Brian B.,2TDlqcLBqd3XNx1LlnPQ3g,"Woodridge, IL",0,1,0,0,67,cUkmLvEyThOEDzOFJylsfQ,5,22/01/15,"The food was a 3 but the place reeks of cigarette smoke, is clearly not cleaned or repainted on a regular basis, and the only seating in the front of the restaurant was extremely cold every time the door opens to the street.

But for all intensive purposes I&#39;d say 3.5, obviously leaning towards 4.My wife and I went for dinner on a Saturday evening. Weekend impromptu dinners out are usually a little tough for us since we&#39;re not big on crowds or patience when it comes to waiting for food. Wait nor crowds were an issue here. There was only one set of diners when we walked in. The place was very quiet. Actually a bit too quiet in my opinion. I may recommend some soft &#34;cover&#34; music.Anyway, we started with an order of spring rolls. They were very light and cool. Perfect for a 90 degree day like Saturday was. They are, for those unaware, rice paper wrapped, not fried, and served cold. These were filled with shrimp, pork, Â and cucumber, along with some greens. All fresh and delicious.Moving on to entrees, I ordered the pho with BBQ pork and shrimp, topped with a few small halved egg rolls, vermicelli, daikon, cilantro, mint, and probably a couple of other things. I want to say a few things about this pho, and pho in general. The mint is not like Wrigley gum or mouthwash. It&#39;s a hint... a light accompaniment. Unless you hate mint, you probably won&#39;t even notice it. Also, this dish is served in a very large bowl, with all ingredients separate. The cold items are cold, the warm meats are... well.. warm. This way you mix it yourself and things don&#39;t start wilting before it hits your table. It was all very fresh and tasted wonderful. I was even given some special hot chili oil to round it all off. The pho is worth it alone. Really. Now, my wife ordered from the small chinese menu they maintain for those who aren&#39;t so sure about the vietnamese food. She was afraid of the mint, which is why I mentioned it specifically. The chicken with noodles was great. No complaints. But after tasting my pho, she agreed that next time she&#39;ll be joining that club.All in all, very good experience with no real complaints at all. The prices are in line (or maybe a touch high for the food/area), the food is fresh, the service was pretty good. The dining area was clean. That said, if you want ambiance, this may not be the place for you. It&#39;s a little bland in that area. But I go for the food. Boring but clean is fine with me when the food is on point like you&#39;ll find here."vietnam-gate-north-aurora,G S.,dMTp-rozYRCFcX3oMWmjtw,"Woodbury, MN",0,1,0,3,49,d_tYw7pFZoyjmv6VaqZH7Q,4,12/06/16,"First off, this restaurant is small however the place is clean. This rating is due to the following...1. The service was extremely slow. We waited for the food over 45 minutes after ordering. This did not counted the 15 minutes wait for them to take our order. 2. There was six dish ordered, five minutes after taking the order, they came out and told us they can only serve 5 because they were out of bread. Three bowl of Pho came out, one of them is meatball pho came without meat balls. The other two dish came out after half of the table was done eating. 3. Â The flavor...pho is rated about a 2...below par. Â This due to high stench of raw meat n lack of pho flavor. Â The banh mi sandwich is nothing to rave about. It was shy of meat at both ends. The vermicelli bowl was shy of noodles n the meat was too salty.So in good conscience, I would not refer this establishment for real Asian foodies. You will be sorely disappointed! Â We stopped by because of the rating and are from out of town.

We had everything from the Banh Mi Â sandwich (bbq pork)) to the #17 Rice Vermicelli bowl and everything was terrific. I am wanting to back and try the Pho which looked delicious ( the table next to us ordered a few bowls), The parking lot is a little awkward but manageable. They have a nice selection on the menu and the inside is welcoming, but the big attraction is the freshness and quality.We went back for a second tine this week to try the Pho and it was worth it!"vietnam-gate-north-aurora,Varisa S.,3W5_684xo7kvUrXbFRmmgA,"Hickory Hills, IL",0,1,0,7,8,oWYbYcZaR_WWb49ADfHglg,5,17/03/16,Food was good and authentic.

The restaurant is a very nice, quaint place, and I felt comfortable bringing my 3-year-old. The waiter was a very sweet girl that was kind to my daughter. We had spring rolls for appetizer and it was authentic. We ordered chicken fried rice for my daughter and if it was extremely flavorful. Dare I say it&#39;s probably the best fried rice I&#39;ve had!

I stopped in today for two orders of pho and some spring rolls. The pho was great, and the spring rolls were a real treat, but everything felt a few dollars more expensive than it should have been (particularly for the area). Pho was about $10 each, spring rolls were $6, which set me back close to $30 for lunch. Considering how incredibly simple pho is, $10 feels like a lot. The meat also had a strange texture to it.Their parking lot is really crazy, as you&#39;ve got to take a supremely hard right to get in if you&#39;re coming from the north, and you can&#39;t turn in left when you&#39;re coming from the south (or turn left when you&#39;re leaving) because of the massive median strip there. It&#39;s not that big of a deal, just something to be aware of so you don&#39;t curb it coming in.Oh, and I&#39;m not sure if whether it&#39;s because this place is new, but it is absurdly clean inside. I&#39;ve been to a lot of asian restaurants, both dine-in and take out, in my life, and Vietnam Gate is in its own universe of cleanliness."vietnam-gate-north-aurora,Jim K.,0mgZF0Z0JGRrbfSXjp3XRQ,"North Aurora, IL",1,1,0,4,4,M78enxavCuzuCoWFmuuG0A,3,07/11/15,"On cool and misty day during a recent trip to Montreal, my mind and my stomach turned to that most wonderful of soups, pho. Â Since Chinatown was right across the street from the hotel where I was staying, I ventured out and brought back some of the best and most complex pho I&#39;d ever had. Â It was heaven and a high water mark for me.On a chilly gray Friday in North Aurora, that craving returned and I just had to head over to Vietnam Gate for a pho fix.I drove over early to avoid the rush hour traffic and the place was empty, but when I opened the door the most wonderful aromas enveloped me. Â The very helpful and friendly lady behind the counter took my order and went to prepare it. Â Besides both chicken and beef pho, I ordered two gui cuon, a large order of chicken lo mein and marinated pork and shrimp with vermicelli.My order was made very quickly, packaged nicely, and I was even helped with the packages to my car! Â Now that&#39;s service!If there is a single word that describes all of the tasty food we had, it would be Fresh, with a capital F. Â The pho broth was very nice with just the right touches of ginger, cloves and star anise, not overly salty, the thinly slice beef very tender and the accompaniments (bean sprouts, basil, jalapenos, onions, lime and of course the noodles) were great. Â This was not my Montreal pho, but did it ever hit the spot. Â The gui cuon were wonderful with a nice peanut/fish sauce for dipping.The chicken lo mein was excellent! Â Not your garden variety dark brown sauce over pasta noodles, the sauce and the chicken had the same subtle flavor as the pho and again, the fresh vegetables in it put the dish over the edge. Â My step-daughter loves lo mein and she gave it two thumbs up.I can&#39;t comment on the pork and shrimp dish as I saved it for a lunch, but the forkful that I did have was delicious.So glad that we have a local spot for when my pho meter gets low, but the rest of the menu is going to get a work out as well."vietnam-gate-north-aurora,Lisa H.,k-9cnfUPWPzLnclLwsgmNg,"Aurora, IL",0,1,0,34,11,uBt0Co8wcfE1qRG9-wakIg,4,12/05/16,"I&#39;m delighted that there is finally a Vietnamese restaurant in town, and a great one at that! I stopped by a few months ago for dinner and ordered a beef springroll bowl. Service was pretty slow and the server forgot my drink, but the bowl more than made up for it. The dressing was light and the springrolls were crisp, warm, and delicious.While I was there for lunch today, I decided to order a BBQ pork banh mi and a hot thai coffee. Service was much faster and organized, and the food once again did not dissapoint! Whatever bread they use for the sandwich is AMAZING, and the toppings were fantastic and ample to boot.

Go there for a lunchtime bowl of the street food style pho.I hadn&#39;t realized that it was fast food. My husband and I were initially a little disappointed when we walked in and saw the Chinese food on the hot line that did not look terribly enticing. But I have a big soft spot for Vietnamese food after living on it for a year so we took our chances. Good decision.The Vietnamese side of the menu is small -- egg rolls, spring rolls, chicken or beef pho (noodle soup), and pork banh mi (sandwich), pretty much rounds out the menu, just like street food in Hanoi or Saigon where a shop on the sidewalk or in a shack might have just two offerings.We both ordered spring rolls, with sides of peanut sauce. They were perfectly tasty and fresh.My husband ordered the beef pho -- a big bowl of glass noodles, strips of beef and broth. It was delicious and absolutely authentic, and not overly greasy. The beef was cooked a bit more than usual -- no pink -- which I personally like. The broth was flavorful. Toss in some Siracha and the greens, sprouts and jalapenos they give you on the side and you&#39;re good to go.I ordered the Vietnamese sandwich, a.k.a. banh mi. Pork generally freaks me out, but it was not overly fatty and was flavorful.Drinks are limited to soda or water. Bummer because a Vietnamese-style iced coffee would have been awesome.The service was also authentic, in that everything came out one at a time and it wasn&#39;t lightning fast.

One of them was a carry out, the other a sit down. They are a very clean place and service is gracious too, so good points for that ! Â Request - please keep up the cleanliness and good service - it&#39;s important for the long term success !The food is average. Their fried rice and lo mein are close to the American-Chinese versions, so were not a surprise, even though I was told they would be more of the Vietnamese style. I must say the dishes were low in soy sauce and MSG in general, so at least that was better.The pho was good, my first time eating pho, so can&#39;t compare at this point. However they charged extra for an extra request of some bean sprouts and I didn&#39;t think that was fair. Bean sprouts are cheap and a little bit extra, especially for a large group of people, should come free.The portions are okay, could do a little better on adding a little more to the lo mein dish especially because this is not some combo dish.This place has good prospects if they strike a rapport with their regulars. It&#39;s critical that they distinguish themselves from the typical Chinese fast food place (of which there are numerous in Aurora, at stone&#39;s throw from Vietnam Gate) ! It would be better for them to expand and popularize their Vietnamese menu and not the Chinese ones, because that&#39;s what going to make them different from the average fast food spot in that area.I am hopeful that this place will prosper given that they take at least some of the above comments in a constructive way. The folks running this place seem hard working and polite and I wish them success in this new venture !"vietnam-gate-north-aurora,Bee M.,uH0Curyg7F1B8ZEnS7XCJQ,"Chicago, IL",0,1,0,0,24,Oau7wuIpFxVkvP29aw2DVw,3,31/03/16,Delicious and authentic vietnamese cuisine plus great customer service!!!

We wanted to try a varied selection of items. The food was very fresh.. veggies, meats and herbs. My husband loved the pork spring roll and his noodle dish, which was huge with fresh toppings. I had a bahn mi beef sandwich...delicious tender spiced meat, crisp veggies, toasted roll... would have again in a heart beat at $5.50. The beef pho broth smelled so good, Chinese five spice I think. Came with a pile of fresh basil, cilantro, lime, and sprouts to add. The bowl was so large I took leftovers for lunch for $10 good deal.

And somehow, Malort had made its way on there. If you don&#39;t know, Malort is a hometown liquor, Swedish in origin, made from wormwood and almost impossible to get outside of Chicago. So she (and my intrepid boyfriend) decided they had to try it. I called around and the Lantern was able to supply us, so we trekked down one night for a snootful.Now, I only had a tiny sip of theirs. Â Bu we had read things about &#34;The Malort face&#34; (due to its bitterness) and wanting more despite its awful taste. I can safely tell you that none of us wanted another round, and our kindly waitress commisserated with us about it afterward. (The Lantern must do a business in Malort, though, because you can by tshirts that say &#34;I Got Malorted at The Lantern&#34; -- it&#39;s right up on the wall over the bar!)As to the bar itself, this is a casual corner hangout: dark, wood walls, free popcorn machine, darts and other gaming, Cubs game on all the TVs (occasionally inspiring deafening roars from the crowd).

Of course it was fairly busy during the late afternoon on St. Patricks Day. I met some friends there who had been there for about 20 minutes before I arrived. Chris came over with a round of beers and quickly disappeared without noticing that two people including myself had joined the table. I&#39;ve been a server before so I always give people a break when it comes to crappy service. What we received wasnt just crappy service, but appalling how disrespectful and rude Chris was to us. After trying to flag her down multiple times for a drink, I finally went to the bar. I finally got Chris to stop at our table and I asked for a menu because I wanted food. She brought over a menu and stood there while I scanned it over. I had never been here before so I wasnt sure what I wanted. When I asked if she could give me a minute, she rudely threw her hands up in the air and grunted loudly. She came back a couple minutes later and I had decided that we were going to leave after being treated so poorly. She yells &#34;REALLY&#34; right in our faces and stomps away like a 12 year old. Mind you, Chris is 61 years old, as she proudly told us later in our interaction.Chris&#39;s attitude towards her guests rivals that of a server at Ed Debevics. She is rude, crass and has no respect. I wont even get into the screaming she engaged Â in when one of our friends asked what her problem was. She asked where we served so she could come over there and give us hell.I confronted the manager who came and apologized as Chris has an &#34;off putting sense of humor&#34;.

Based on my pizza and the numerous other pizza pictures on Yelp, Braconi&#39;s does a great job with visual presentation. My pizza was very photogenic! They layered a generous amount of black olives all over the pizza. The balance of pepperoni, onion, cheese, and sauce was to my liking as well. The crust was crispy on the ends and the pizza itself held together well enough that you could eat the end pieces without utensils and not have a mess.

Seeing as how it&#39;s a Friday night, it&#39;s cold, and the Blackhawks are on, I didn&#39;t anticipate my food being here in that time frame.

They make you choose an additional topping (for an extra charge, of course), so I went with extra basil. I figured this was the closest thing to a Margherita pizza.My doorbell rang at 6:40 (!!). After signing for my order, and wishing the driver a good night, I opened the box. I was very pleased to see TONS of basil on my pizza. I didn&#39;t even grab a plate, I picked up a piece right then and there to sample. Oh my. The pizza was GOOD. I mean, wow. The basil was fresh, the cheese was neither sparse nor was it copious. The tomatoes were subtle in flavor, letting the basil be the star of this show. There was a hint of fresh garlic, which was a nice surprise. I l-o-v-e garlic, but I was afraid it would overtake the other ingredients. This was not the case.I am so glad I gave Braconi&#39;s a chance.

My initial impression is that they care more about getting pizza&#39;s out the door than they care about the quality of the food.I ordered by phone for pick up a small, thin cheese pizza for my kids and a stuffed veggie pizza for my wife and I. The woman on the phone said it would be ready in 25 minutes. I thought to myself, &#34;Gosh, that is rather quick for a stuffed pizza to be ready. Thin crust, okay, but stuffed, WOW! They must have a super high-speed efficient pizza oven.&#34; Sure enough, when I brought the pizzas back home both the thin cheese and stuffed pizza were undercooked. I am not sure how you undercook a thin cheese pizza but they figured it out. The dough on the stuffed was spongy and undercooked and you also tell that the dough on the thin cheese pizza was undercooked. Even the cheese on the thin pizza looked as if it never reached the bubbling point.I will say this, the taste was good once we finished cooking the pizza. I believe this location has been open for some time so I am not sure if anyone else has experienced the same issue as I did.Questions:Q: Will I go back?A. Not to this location. Maybe the location on Royal Saint George is better.Q. Was the staff friendlyA. No problems there. The women who took the order and the cashier (one in the same I believer) couldn&#39;t have been more friendly.Q. Did I call and complain?A. No, I would rather post my comments publicly like everyone else these days.Q. Would I recommend?A.

Â The first was a dinner with friends and the second was lunch with family. Â Place is nice inside, nothing special. It has a small bar and bar eating area. Â It has a typical dining area and a small separate party room. Â It has an open kitchen and things look fairly organized and clean.Lets start with the dinner experience. Â We had small pizza as an appetizer. Â Pizza was delicious. Â I would say some of the best in the Fox Valley area. Â Entrees were also delicious and the size was very large. Â We all had a take home meal. Price for 4 with 2 drinks each and a dessert to split $111 without tip. Â  So, 5 stars on the dinner. Â Had such a great time and food we came back for a follow up lunch 2 weeks later. Â Came for the $9 lunch buffet. Â Buffet is kind of on the smaller size, but they do a nice job to get a good variety out there. Â They had about 4 salads, 2 pasta dishes and about 4-5 different pizzas. Â Plus, 3 desserts to choose from. Â Buffet is from 11-2 and we got there around 12:25. Â Buffet was about 85% empty and pizza was looking pretty crispy from sitting out under the heat lamps.Salads were all almost empty. Â Pasta seemed fine, but it&#39;s pasta. Â It keeps well in a covered chafing dish. Â Here is were the problem starts. Â It starts with the waitress. Â I mentioned to her about the condition of the buffet and she responds that it opens at 11 and they don&#39;t want to waste food. Â I understand not wanting to waste food, but there is no excuse not to have any cheese,pepperoni or sausage pizza out there. Â No excuse to have empty or almost empty salad bowls. Â I worked in the food business for 27 years. Â Her excuse is not what you tell the customers. Â A buffet table should never sit less than 50% empty and if it looks unappetizing, remove it from the table. Â Rotate your salads. Â Never run out of cheese, sausage or pepperoni pizzas. Â Make half and half pizzas if you are that slow. Â Make smaller size pizzas if you are that slow. A buffet not only has to taste fresh, but it has to look fresh too. Â We ended up ordering off the menu. Â The only highlight of that lunch was, who I guess was the owner or the mother of the owner. Â She was super friendly and sat with us when we came in and came around a couple times to chat. Â That is what is missing from restaurants today.Kudos for that. Â To sum up the lunch experience, waitress excuses, lack of caring and overall attitude..... totally unacceptable. Â Condition of the buffet and freshness....totally unacceptable. Â Lunch bill for 3 was $38 without tip.I would give lunch a 1 star. Â For the owners: 01/21/14. Table 54. Seat 1 Chk #12 receipt Tanya G. Â Hope that helps them correct that problem.

Â Pasta filled over 70% of the plate and I had two added meatballs that the wait staff told me would melt in my mouth. Â Not the case. Â Salad was to have Balsamic Vinegariette Â that turned out to be vinegar.

Â The entrees are traditional Italian fare like pasta, and they are generally good. Â There is also dessert in the form of cakes and brownies available. Â Those are very good.

There are quite a few options on the menue, so we debated for a while and went with a deep dish spinach pizza and a thin crust bbq chicken pizza (yes we are pigs sometimes).We had to wait a long time for the pizza - that is really major negative I experienced.

The mozzarella sticks were ok, but the cheese wasn&#39;t very warm so it was like eating fried string cheese, just a big clump of cheese that didn&#39;t melt well enough for my liking. But the sauces were yummy to dip it all in, so it made up for the hard cheese. We also had garlic bread which tasted good, nothing unusual or out of this world, just good regular garlic bread.Then came the pizza! We had tons of choices, all pipping hot and very tasty. I liked the ratio of cheese and sauce, neither one over powered the other. I also liked the cornmeal on the bottom of the crusts, it gave it an interesting texture and an unique taste.The staff was friendly and understanding of our large group and we didn&#39;t feel rushed to hurry up and leave.

My short take on Naf Naf, I really enjoyed/loved their homemade pita bread, the Chicken Shwarma were nice thin, long slices of beautifully marinaded chicken. I didn&#39;t like that they do not carry, my favorite condiment, the yogurt cucumber tzatziki sauce. I thought there was too much of the salad fixings with the hummus on my sandwich to enjoy the meat. Traditional but &#39;After all enjoying Middle Eastern food is all about the spices&#39;. After removing most of the salad fixings the meat was very flavorful and the pita was Soft,Delicious and enjoyable.After reading reviews about Pitaville I had to give it a try. Upon arrival on a Friday night around 7pm I found this store front restaurant had a nice flow of customers and almost all of the side tables were full w mostly people who are native to this type of cuisine(A GOOD SIGN). I ordered the Chicken and Beef Shwarma. Service was pleasant and helpful. I immediately determined that the pitas are not house made because stacks of them were on the shelves, in plastic bags in the prep area. One negative. When I saw them take, what appeared to be a x-large, oval shaped pita, like a burrito tortilla, stuff it will my particulars, press it in a panini press, then further crisp it up on a flat top grill, I was suspicious. My suspicions were confirmed when I got home. Hard bread, dry chopped chicken and beef. Not a good turn from Naf Naf. Please don&#39;t chop the meat from the spit and why toast and press pita bread?In all fairness this review is only for the items i ordered, the Chicken and Beef Shwarma&#39;s. I did hear that the meat combo(oops! w some shwarma meat), was a good choice.Although I have my doubts about returning I can only suspect that many reviews were written by people who may have limited experience with this type of food and the natives were there because its cheaper. Just my take. Â They do have yogurt cucumber tzatziki sauce!My search will not stop at Naf Naf, it has it&#39;s shortcomings, but so far it rates higher than Pitaville for maybe a $1.00 per more.

When it came out though, it was piping hot. The flavor of the wrap itself was mild, but once I added a little bit of the red/hot sauce they provided, it was bursting with flavor.

I mean, they&#39;re amazing. So, its hard to compete.But I really can&#39;t say I will be returning here. I paid .75 cents for garlic sauce that I took one bite of and didn&#39;t use again, the baba tasted like hummas, the pita was decent and nothing special, and the falafel was too fried and tasted like chicken (they do chicken nuggets...

I walked into a familiar feeling Mediterranean restaurant that stood out immediately to me due to its aesthetics: it had a well-kept dining area with a tall cobble stone wall surrounding the open kitchen and graphically pleasant menu board at the front. I ordered a beef shawarma wrap with hummus and a six piece falafel on the side totaling a little over ten dollars. The man taking my order told me my order would be ready in ten minutes and indeed after ten minutes of listening to the electrifying sizzling of the griddle and the exhilarating bubbling of the fryer, my meal was ready to devour.The first thing I noticed about my plate was that everything was colorful, from the vegetables inside the wrap to the bright red seasoning on the hummus. Upon taking a huge bite of the grill pressed wrap, I realized my mouth was full of mostly vegetables (lettuce, tomatoes, cucumber, and carrots). Taken by surprise, I decided to probe the so called beef wrap only to find a handful of scraps of meat. I ended up dissecting the wrap to find the meat because the pita shell had quickly become soggy and dripping with sauce like a runny faucet. The beef that was so scarcely strewn about the wrap was cooked to perfection; however, there was one major drawback. The meat was flavorless. Next, I decided to take a shot at the falafel. I took a piece and dunked it into the small pool of hummus and took an enormous bite. The falafel had a crunchy exterior and moist interior, and the hummus was thick and creamy; it was everything I had hoped for in falafel and hummus...except for one rather large weakness. Both were flavorless. As a last-ditch effort, I decided to try to the sauces accompanying my platter of surprisingly lackluster food. The tzatziki sauce played along ever so seamlessly with the central theme of my meal, no flavor. It seemed as if I was eating a generic Mediterranean sauce that had no place anywhere because adding it to my food didn&#39;t enhance or worsen the flavors (or lack thereof). Standards having been lowered, I tried a squirt of the red chili sauce and tasted absolutely nothing for a few seconds and then the spice slowly emerged from the background like a subdued buildup in a dramatic movie soundtrack. The odd thing about this sauce was that although it had spice, there was no other flavor associated with it. I don&#39;t know how it was possible to have a chili sauce that had spice with no flavor, but I wasn&#39;t really surprised at this point.Disappointingly reflecting on the meal I had just eaten, I felt a bit out of place because it was as if my taste buds had been taken away from me prior to this Mediterranean trek. Needless to say, there were rudimentary seasonings missing from every item I had ordered. Â The irony in all this being that there is a grocery store named Spice Mart that shares a wall with this restaurant. If only they had shared more than a wall. The optimist in me felt like maybe I hadn&#39;t chosen the right items or I hadn&#39;t come on a good time of the day or day of the week, but I realized that after this experience, I would most likely not return to search for any truth in that thought."pitaville-mediterranean-grill-naperville,Jacqueline B.,zKY6NM9CxxWxcY5JJXUB7g,"Aurora, IL",1,1,1,2327,261,jAxAQL2Jt24HA7xFnUBz0Q,2,13/08/14,"I was in the area and was in need of a late lunch - something quick that I could carry out, so I jumped on my Yelp app to check out what was nearby. I had never heard of Pitaville, but words like Pita and Mediterranean always catch my eye (and my taste buds)!The menu has a good variety. I personally tend to always choose something that includes falafel when I&#39;m at a mediterranean joint, so I went with the Falafel Wrap! I&#39;m not sure if I misjudged this place by thinking it was a fast casual restaurant, but the amount of time it took to prepare a wrap was disappointing and definitely not fast. I was the only one in the restaurant and it took a solid 10-12 minutes. Now I wasn&#39;t expecting this to be freaky-fast, but I just thought waiting that long for one wrap to be made was a tad ridiculous.Regardless, I grabbed my order eventually and was on my merry way. When I got home and opened the bag I was pleasantly surprised - the wrap was a lot bigger than I was expecting! It came with two sauce containers which was also highly appreciated. In a nutshell, the wrap was just okay. I&#39;ve definitely had better.Needless to say I finished the whole thing, but key take-a-ways were how filling the wrap was and the tasty sauces. I personally thought the falafel itself was sort of dry and tasteless and the wrap was a little burnt and blah-tasting. I would have hoped for a softer wrap and more moist falafel - to me that&#39;s a fresh taste.I think this place has a lot of promise, but there&#39;s definitely room for improvement when it comes to efficiency and food quality!

Maybe it isn&#39;t entirely their fault; my appetite has been non-existent until the evening hours, so trying to grab something for lunch has been a challenge lately.I entered Pitaville and attempted to quickly decide on something to eat. My usual at any place with &#34;Pita&#34; in their name is a chicken kebab sandwich, or something similar. But today I decided to go with a small Jerusalem salad, which contains cucumber, tomatoes, parsley, garlic, olive oil &amp; sesame paste. I wasn&#39;t diggin&#39; the sesame paste idea but I thought I&#39;d give it a go. The man who took my order asked if I wanted pita bread with my salad and I told him &#34;sure.&#34;About five minutes later, my order was ready. Now, I know I ordered a small, but I had envisioned something a bit bigger than I received. After all, it&#39;s just vegetables really. I guess the cost would be from the olive oil and sesame paste.As expected, my tastebuds weren&#39;t delighted with the sesame paste. I ate about a third of the salad and gave up. So then I tried the pita bread, and unfortunately was met with the same stiff, thin, and definitely not fresh bread many other reviewers encountered. Â It came with a tiny container of some kind of watery sauce. To say I was disappointed was an understatement, but seeing as how I paid a little less than $6 for the salad and a bottle of water, I guess I got what I paid for.The restaurant itself was clean, and fairly spacious. The man who took my order was nice, as was the employee who gave me my order. I might give this place another chance when my appetite has returned to normal, but will avoid the pita bread."pitaville-mediterranean-grill-naperville,Rossel E.,vKmjfUd47QPj447AV2MqUA,"Aurora, IL",1,1,0,37,38,2tz1668a4TG7AkQJcPHIGg,3,01/04/15,"If you&#39;re craving for silky hummus with grilled kebab or shawarma over a steaming bed of basmati rice?

The food was good. However I called to place an order for delivery. The gentleman stated all deliverys need to Â be submitted online. OK so I place my order through yelp at 5:49pm. I receive my confirmation email at 6:09pm. An hour later I call pitaville directly from yelps listed phone number to check on the delivery. The young man I spoke to had difficulty finding my order then said that I ordered an entree even though I thought I ordered my fiancee a sandwich. He stated that by the amount I was charged it was definitely an entree. FINE he said that he would see to it I received my food in 30 min. I did get the food by 7:30pm. But when we get it, we in fact did receive only the sandwich not the entree I was told we were to expect. CONFUSED I obviously want to be sure I&#39;m refunded if I was over charged I call the same exact number I called earlier to pitaville. The man who answered this time says I need to contact s 3rd party delivery express? That that&#39;s who I called earlier. But I simply clicked in my iPhone the same number labeled &#34; pitaville &#34; I contacted just 30 min prior. So they give a number but the number provided was not who they claimed id be contacting.

I&#39;ll bet if I read those horoscope things mine would have said that today would be a 3 or lesser.I won&#39;t go into it all, but I will say that if I didn&#39;t get some falafel today that bad things were going to happen. V. bad things. Things involving speaking in tongues, head spinning, and only the devil knows what else so after a quick yelp search nearby for pitas on my way to work (I&#39;d already driven waaay past Naf Naf or that would&#39;ve been my destination) and Pitaville turned up as my most convenient option. Unfortunately, I ended up trading quality and flavor for convenience.I paid just under $11 for the Veggie Delight pita plate- a combination of Hummus, Baba Ganoush, Falafel, Jerusalem Salad and Pita. I think I paid about $6-$8 too much but they did give me a coupon for next time in my take-out bag... but I don&#39;t know how soon that next time&#39;ll be.When I opened the container everything was all mixed and blended together- It was hard to tell what was what and it definitely looked like it had either been dropped or played kickball with. Sad face for the gooshy looking food but if it&#39;s good- who cares, right? Well, onto that unfortunate tale next.My Pitas-What I had hoped for: Soft, pillow-y pocketsWhat I got: Thin, stiff, stale, and sad excuses for pita.My Falafel-What I had hoped for: Crispy + Crunchy outside and a soft flavorful insideWhat I got: Hard balls that tasted like they&#39;d had some level of freezer burn before being re-fried with a most disappointingly dry center.Hummus + Baba Ganoush + Jerusalem Salad-What I had hoped for: Well, I certainly hadn&#39;t hoped to be reviewing them all together but since they all ran together in my mashed up container, I have no choice.What I got: Liquid and runny hummus with a flavorless baba ganoush and wilty Jerusalem salad + a stomach ache.The staff was friendly and the hot sauce was decent- or at least they were generous with it (unlike their meal portions) so that&#39;s really the only saving grace here.

Between accidents in beds and accidentally killing the fish in the fish tank, none of us were having a very good day. We randomly stopped here not knowing what to expect but looking for an affordable lunch that wasn&#39;t deep fried and greasy.As it happened, the 4-year old had an accident in the car and ruined our sit-down to eat. We instead took our order to go and headed home--none of us in a very good mood, except the baby. Then Kim knocked over my Dr Pepper into the back seat floor of the Jeep. When it rains...We got home, cleaned everyone up, put the kids down for naps and had forgotten about our food. Amazingly, it was mostly still warm.I wasn&#39;t expecting Mediterranean food when we walked into Pitaville, and not that I am not interested in trying different foods, but the mood we were in really just called for something expected and comfortable. The menu had plenty of things I was interested in trying, but not today. I had no patience for experimenting with something new and ending up not liking what I bought.Kim and I both went for the Chicken Kabob on a pita, and we got Elise fries because she won&#39;t eat anything that has any nutritional value. When we finally unwrapped it all at home, we found little containers of sauces, which turned out to both be delicious. The hot sauce is well beyond my Scoville tolerance, but I couldn&#39;t stop putting it on the pita.We both really loved everything we had--to the point that Kim let me know that if I wasn&#39;t going to finish mine, that she would take one for the team and finish it for me. Not a chance.It was a very pleasant surprise to stumble onto this great little restaurant and both of us cant wait to go back to try more of the menu.

Sorry, Pitaville, but Naf Naf wins. Why?The breakdown:My boyfriend and I went for dinner on a week-night. The place was pretty dark inside (minimal decor aside from a tv) with a few diners. Service was friendly and helpful.He got the lamb kebab entree, I got the dinner meat combo (beef kafta kebab, chicken kafta kebab, beef shwarma and falafel. Also came with a small piece of grilled chicken, all over saffron rice.)The biggest sin was that everything was so DRY. The meat, the pitas (which tasted right out of a store bag), the falafel. My dinner combo would have been a nice sampling of their offerings but everything lacked moisture. The worst was the beef shwarma, small shavings of beef that were so dried out as to be totally unappetizing. The best was the grilled chicken, which had been marinated in some spices so as to become yellow, but even this was thin and fairly arid. Adding the hot sauce and tzaziki-like sauce from squeeze bottles helped to hide this somewhat, but not enough.The rice was the best offering.My boyfriend thought the same of his lamb kebab dish: too dry.Having used our coupon, we are now armed with knowledge of one more Naperville restaurant.

Â The shawarma was amazingly good. Â When I mixed it all together on the plate it was like magic in my mouth and I hardly noticed that the pita was just your average pita. Â I would totally come back here and try some of the other great things on the menu. Â The restaurant isn&#39;t huge and you order at a counter and come get your food when they call your number but the people behind the counter were very friendly.

We came sad and hungry, we left with happy tummies and smiling faces - what could be better?!Imran, the owner, welcomed us in at 9:48 pm and gave us time to decide what we wanted to order without rushing us, he recommended some items from the menu and patiently answered all our questions. He let us eat in the restaurant past close and did not give us the slightest hint that he wanted us out, so that he could pack up and leave. In fact, we felt extremely comfortable and relaxed due to his friendly nature. The high level of customer service had us hooked!!We ordered the lamb kefta kebab, chicken shawerma wrap, french fries and baklava. The star of our table was the lamb kefta kebab as it is not often that once comes across a perfectly seasoned and perfectly cooked piece of meat. It was accompanied by delicious rice that had tonnes of flavour and fluffy goodness.The chicken in the shawerma was extremely tender and was filled with fresh vegetables encased in a soft and chewy piece of pita. The portion sizing at Pitvaville is pretty decent - my husband was full after eating 3/4 of it (we obviously took the remaining home. Cant let such a yummy shawerma go to waste now, can we?)Also, a quick shout out to the amazing hummus. SInce I make my own hummus, I am pretty particular about it and I know a good one when I see it. This hummus was everything that it is supposed to be - creamy, seasoned, delectable!And, we ended our wonderful meal on a sweet and crispy note thanks to the baklava. It was the best baklava that I have had in a while. You need to try it!!!WIll we be back? Definitely. Will we rave about this restaurant forever? Absolutely.

Like, none. Pretty sure they&#39;re operating at a 100% success rate in the keeping-everyone-alive-while-on-or-near-the-premises department.I mean, I have no way of knowing for sure (about the Kool Aid drink-age thing). None of us do. But I can, will, and and am very prepared to speculate on it all.Anyway, the base point I&#39;m trying to make here is that it really only takes one poke of a pita to become a devout follower of all things Naf Naf.I&#39;ve been frequenting the original Naf Naf since it&#39;s first (and far less chic) days back on Ogden avenue in the old Taco Bell space (now located in the far fancier Freedom Drive digs), but this was my first ever time at *this* particular Naf Naf.VERDICT: Above and beyond.

I started to look at the menu (which is exactly the same as the other location - a good thing) and then one thing led to another and all of a sudden I&#39;m standing at the end of the line with red-blinking pager thing waiting for dinner for 4 with apps, sides, and dessert to come up. I couldn&#39;t help it.All our food was perfect and came up lickety-split + when I was ordering, the cashier girl complimented my hair and I know that could just be a thing they do, but I&#39;m telling you, it felt really genuine. THEN, while I was waiting for my food (and feeling super good about myself because of the aforementioned compliment) when the guy manning the pick-up area asked me how my day was going. So nice and again, felt really genuine.If Naf Naf really did offer Kool Aid, I honestly might consider drinking it.

Â We came to this area as my wife wanted to shop one last time at Achievers before it closed for good. Â While she was going about her business, I started planning for lunch and noticed this place on my book marks and saw that a few trusty Yelp friends recently came here, so figured it was a safe bet for a good lunch.Once again, Yelp provides us with a great eating experience.I&#39;m a fan of the kabob / pitta scene and know my way around the menu of such places. Â I frequent Pitta In, as there is one close by my work, which is &#34;always&#34; packed. Â  My problem, is one pitta is &#34;never&#34; enough for me, and depending on the place, the platter can be a bit large for lunch. Â  So, being this was my first time at Naf Naf, I was pondering on what to get. Â  When I looked about the sizable dinning area, I noticed everyone had some sort of Pita, and there were no platters. Â  So, what to do... Pita or Platter it? Â  I consulted with my wife to see how hungry she was, which came back with a, &#34;I&#39;m starved.&#34; Â  Great! Â  I am too. Â And, considering time time of day 2:00 pm, this lunch would good up dinner time, so, figured, we&#39;ll go for it and make this our large meal of the day.So, ordered two types of pitta (chicken &amp; beef) and a mixed kabob platter. Â  Needless to say this was a lot of food, but it gave us the chance to try out a few things and enjoy the various textures, aromas, and sauces. Â  ALL of which passed our palates with ease and tickled our taste buds! Â  Â I liked the hot sauce, it was a great add. Â I was however disappointed with the rice and the soda coming out of the self served fountain was flat.The atmosphere was okay, high cleaning, open space, plenty of seating. Â The restrooms were clean. Â  Â The service was okay, you just interact at the counter.Overall we were happy with the meal. Â As others said, the chicken shwarma pita was probably the best part, but the kabob platter was a very close second. Â  I certainly would not go out of my way to come here, as I think the Pita Inn close to my home is better than Naf Naf... but would certainly come back here when I&#39;m in the area."naf-naf-grill-aurora,John B.,xgB7Gav_rmc341zv1Hhc1w,"Oswego, IL",0,1,1,44,36,uasvU5SLqzDAcV0vHil0OQ,4,08/01/14,"Love this place.

Â Well, I guess I&#39;m glad I got that out of the way today.The food is good, quality, fast, and authentic enough. Â The fresh, warm pitas are awesome. Â I&#39;ll give Naf Naf that.

Â The fare offered at Naf Naf is, essentially, street food. Â Naf Naf borders on being categorized as fast food Mediterranean--in fact, my meal was served on a tray along with plastic ware. Â That being said, I just can&#39;t justify the price point.I am by no means a cheap bastard, but I&#39;ve been to plenty of non-chain, family-owned Mediterranean restaurants and paid about the same as what Naf Naf charges. Â But it&#39;s more understandable to pay those prices at the other restaurants where you are being serviced by wait staff and eat your kebob on actual ceramic dishes with actual silverware. Â Some even provide belly dancers to entertain the diners.Naf Naf offers great food. Â Just not for the price. Â The only way I can see them justifying the prices is if they start having belly dancers serve you your shawarmas at your tables.

I would be here once a week, I&#39;m fairly certain.Their pitas are like little homemade pita-pillows. They are delectable as fine chocolate, light as air and fresher than an apple directly off a tree. They melt in your mouth like M&amp;M&#39;s in your hand. Yes, I can go on for days about how amazing their pitas are. And I might get back to them a little further in my review...but I can tell you that you have to try them to know what I&#39;m talking about.So, my fiance and I were in the area for an appointment and I know how much I love Naperville and how rarely I visit, so we decided to grab a bite and try to keep it on the cheap. Â The single $ sign on Yelp and 4 stars led us here.To begin, they are kinda set up like Chipotle. I have to be honest and say that this may devalue the place a little for me. I get the concept: order at the counter, fill up your drink, find a table, wait to be paged, collect your food. I have no issue with this at all. Just the layout makes this a bit of a &#34;Mediterranean Chipotle&#34; for me. No great thrill about the same old dining scene. When I walked in, that&#39;s exactly what crossed my mind.My favorite points:-They offer both Coke Zero and Sprite Zero---total score!! Too bad, I am watching my soda intake and sodium, so I skipped the soda during this visit.-The food is prepared in front of you. You can stand at the counter and watch your meal prepared.-FRESHEST pitas known to man! (sold by the bag at the counter- kinda wish I grabbed a bag of them)-Wait time is minimal.We both ordered the Chicken Schawarma pitas. No healthier pita option available. But totally worth the calories. I didn&#39;t read the sign well enough to know that hummus is used as a spread on the sandwich. Next time, I will ask for it on the side and you may want to, as well, if you are like me and only like a little hummus. My fiance, however, asked for everything on the side except the salad portion, so his hummus is in a little container in our fridge at home right now. Thank you, hunny, I&#39;ll enjoy that later. I only got the pita sandwich, he added the side and drink for the $2.50. Went for the &#34;fries&#34;. They are more like home fries or chips, even. And delish!! I snuck a few. I just couldn&#39;t help myself. Also, totally worth the calories. And enough for two to share, by the way!! The chicken schawarma is both dark and white meat chicken combined. Didn&#39;t really know that originally, but surprisingly, it wasn&#39;t fatty at all.The place was clean, bathrooms included. The tables were cleaned off and the soda station/utensil area was not a mess. They obviously take pride in their restaurant and I was pleased to see the employee cleaning on the floor almost the entire time we were there. Garbage was emptied and there wasn&#39;t a pile of baskets at the garbage area. They were on top of it. Impressive. It wasn&#39;t the busiest place in the world, but it seemed a lot of people order to go and take it home. I would do the same but we live too far to take home.Things to work on:-The young lady who took our order told us that lettuce, onion and tomatoes made up the Israeli salad that tops the Chicken Shawarma pita sandwiches. When we got our food, it was cucumber, tomato and onion. Not a problem for me who LOVES cucumbers, but my fiance doesn&#39;t really care for them. No lettuce to be found. Confusing??-I emailed their address found on their webpage to request nutritional info (Email:info@nafnafgrill.com) and received an auto response that the email failed to go through. I was quite disappointed to find that their email doesn&#39;t work and more so, that I have no way to request or find out this information. Yes, I did request it at the counter before we even placed our order.We&#39;ll be back...next time, my sister will have to join me. It&#39;s pretty awesome and the fact that you can keep your caloric intake to a minimum is an advantage (even if I don&#39;t know the exact calorie count, it&#39;s not Portillo&#39;s Beef calories).Signed,Slowly Becoming a Fan of Fast Casual Dining."naf-naf-grill-aurora,Jenni E.,orOVeBYy9w7LkdyZqxniJQ,"Downers Grove, IL",1,1,1,132,917,#NAME?,4,04/09/13,"I have been a huge fan of this place for a long time.

Simple clean decor. Placement of tables makes it difficult for wheelchairs. Because it is basically all tables, wheelchairs can fit. It is proximity of tables that prohibited mobility. The simple menu is hard to order off of. The combos are.. Well nothing wrong but just not what I prefer. Customer service was great. We told the person it was first time and he walked us through our order because.... Well... I wanted everything. Â We ended up with 2 mix combos to sample as much as we could. I have to say.. 2 combos and 2 drinks of pop with one extra pita.. $37. + change... For lunch. We were full but that&#39;s still $$$. For a fast food place. Soo the important part... The food; Â Pitas,baba,hummus, falafel, chicken and soup. Let me start by saying the pita is baked constantly right there.. It is EPIC! So so delish. The Baba is flavorful but strange and hummus was bland. Both covered with paprika and they make a hole in each and fill with oil. Ewww~wah ! it totally ruined it for me. The lental soup was good. Thick with cilantro. Â A herb fav! The chicken was good. Turmeric.. The falafel was good but a bit over fried. The Israel salad is a fav of mine with falafel. This was good as well. Â Nothing tasted overly seasoned.,. Could boarder almost bland. They advertise a tystiki Â sauce but it is a sesame tahini with nooo flavor. Chicken can be hit or miss.. Today was hit. We ordered the Baklava to go. Had later... It was soooo good. Tiny but really good. I love love love that there are no garbages on the eating floor. The design is such that the cleaning.. garbage, trays etc are separated from your eating space. Really nice concept. You bus your table but they also have a person during hi traffic to help and keep tables clean. By the time we left it was packed. I won&#39;t be making this a regular haunt... But I will stop in for a bag of pitas.Note: although nothing tasted salty.. Within 30 min of meal I was ill. Crushing headache... Dizzy.... Just not OK. This only happens when a huge amount of sodium is introduced to my body. Ten min after me my date had a headache. I am sensitive to sodium... He is not. We were dehydrated to the point of lips stuck to teeth. Mmmm water!!! After 2 hours and 2 bottles of water each.

I had the vegetable platter with falafel, pita, tahini, pickles and hot pepper mix and Israeli salad. I&#39;ve had falafel before and liked it, but I loved Naf Naf&#39;s version.

The place looks and feels kind of like Chipotle but the food is made fresh to order here, which is a nice point of difference.That said, I got the falafel pita ($4.99) and had some issues with it:1) There&#39;s no wholewheat pita option and the pita they give you is disgustingly soft, like Wonder Bread. It&#39;s both unhealthy and not particularly tasty, either.2). They don&#39;t put enough cucumbers and tomatoes in the pita.3) The &#34;fries&#34; that come with the dish were soggy. They were meant to be like chips, but they clearly didn&#39;t fry them long enough so they came out limp. This is a serious quality control issue.All that said, the falafel pieces themselves taste pretty good and were properly spiced.If Naf Naf had wholewheat pita and put a little more care into the preparation of their food, I&#39;d give them another star. On a whole, this place offers a nice change of pace from your average stripmall suburban food."dominos-pizza-naperville-5,Graham Z.,j2nA3djIybs034QH48RZyQ,"Downers Grove, IL",0,1,0,3,5,7FtLykILr2pOlBrNK-cgeg,3.5,10/12/15,"This is my go-to cheap pizza location.

I was hungry and we were desperately searching for food on a Thursday evening. Luckily, Hugo&#39;s frog bar was open till late night, so that was an easy choice for us. When we walked into the restaurant, there were a few patrons at the bar area and some leftover in the dining room, but for the most part, the crowd was gone. We were given a choice by the host to sit in either the bar area or the dining room, and we picked the dining room, which seemed more quiet and intimate than the bar.We chose to sit at a cozy booth and the dim lighting and nice dÃ©cor made this place easily enjoyable. We were greeted immediately. I ordered a sunrise martini, which was strong and excellent. For our starter, we decided to share the jumbo lump crab cake--this was delicious! A huge crab cake, this was packed with crab meat and had a surprising relish throughout, which added both flavor and crunch. The hot pink mayonnaise was attractive and delicious, and was a great compliment to the crab cake.I almost decided against a main, but once our server brought out the cuts of meat and fish and described how everything is delivered daily, cooked fresh, and never frozen, I just couldn&#39;t resist. Every meat on his tray looked absolutely delectable, so I had to treat myself to one. I decided on the halibut with lobster risotto. WOW, was this an incredibly delicious dish! The fish was soft, tender, perfectly seasoned, and melt-in-your-mouth. The lobster risotto was just as well seasoned and wonderfully cooked with the right texture and consistency. The pieces of plump lobster really elevated the dish, and I loved every bite of it. As if that weren&#39;t enough, we ordered a side as well: the king crab mac and cheese with andouille sausage. The mac and cheese is very rich and filling, but also tasted very delicious.Overall, this was a surprisingly delicious and satisfying meal. At 10pm on a Thursday night when every other restaurant is closed, it highly exceeded my expectations and as such, I enjoyed phenomenal food.

The sauce that was mixed in was sooo good, i cant quite put my finger on what was in the sauce.I ordered clam chowder and she got the soup of the day, chicken noodle. This was hands down the best chowder ive ever had, and that says a lot ive had many chowders while in the east coast.

Â We were early, which I point out because maybe it played into some of my complaints but definitely doesn&#39;t answer for all of them.The appetizer was the fire cracker shrimp, it was very good and the best part of our meal. Â This was followed up by a wedge salad which came 15 minutes after our appetizer was done. Â Timing is relevant because we didn&#39;t get any refills on drinks (2sodas &amp; a beer) until well after the salad was complete. Â  My wife and son had empty glasses for well over 15 minutes. Â  Waiters were all around, along with serving staff yet no one including our waiter bothered to offer a refill.After the salad, I noticed we were never brought any bread. Â  I had to ask for it in order to get it. Â  I asked after the refills on drinks. Â  For dinner we all had steaks, mine being their signature WR steak. Â  My steak was gelatinous. Â  It wasn&#39;t hot &amp; It just wasn&#39;t good, not much more to say about that. Â  The Brussell sprouts that we ordered, we had to ask for because they forgot them. Â It was great that they showed up when we were 3/4 of the way done with our meal.Lastly, and not a big deal, they bring out cuts of steak and fish to the table for people to see before ordering.

So yeah... you can say me and Hugo&#39;s go way back. Unfortunately, as a young teenager I didn&#39;t appreciate great food nearly as much as I do now.Which is why I was super happy to pay Hugo&#39;s another visit with my family recently to celebrate my mother-in-law&#39;s retirement. We had a reservation for 12 people for dinner on a Saturday night and it was packed! So much so that we even had to wait for our table despite calling ahead. It&#39;s unfortunate how cramped the bar area is. With so many people waiting it was quite the cluster. We were able to grab a drink up at the bar, but then had to try and huddle around one small high top table while staying out of the way of guests passing through to the front door.At least we were seated and I was jazzed to browse the menu. Right off the bat I knew we had to order some crab legs, as well as a cup of New England clam chowder. The sautÃ©ed crab legs with butter were absolutely phenomenal (if you like crab legs that is), and the clam chowder was great. My husband said the chowder definitely wasn&#39;t the best he&#39;s ever had, but still pretty darn good.For my main course I went with the crab stuffed shrimp because, well, come on. Mouth watering to say the least. This dish came with 5 large pieces of shrimp stuffed with a good portioned crab cake that alls at in a delicious lemon better sauce. Amazing. I highlight suggest!Our server was on point. Not only speedy, but funny and personable. Drinks were good, but I didn&#39;t indulge in any of their fancy cocktails. I stuck with a couple old fashioned drinks. They were good, but not the best I&#39;ve had.The biggest upset of this dinner was honestly how packed it was. We were so cramped in that it was hard to even get out of my chair without disrupting the table behind me. Because of the large crowd it was also a very loud dinner, not to mention the sports they had on the TV.Definitely worth a go for their flavorful food.

For $4 a bowl, now that&#39;s a good deal. Steak frites for $15 sounds like a good deal, but you can pass on this. The frites would get in the way when you slice into the steak and they would fly off everywhere. Although the frites seemed to be a bit burdensome, they remind me of those piknik string fried chips.And for dessert, I don&#39;t think they have anything less than 600 calories, so I just chose whatever they recommended and went with the pumpkin pie cheesecake because it was October and I felt festive. You can feel the 1000+ calories pulsing through your veins, but hey, it was worth it.So all in all, a decent experience, and you save a few bucks too.

Parking is available for free in two lots across from the restaurant. There is also a parking garage on Van Buren Avenue, where the restaurant is actually located.The restaurant&#39;s name indicates its main fare: seafood. However, there are plenty of other items on the menu. When I dine at Hugo&#39;s, I usually order Hugo&#39;s turkey club or the herb grilled chicken sandwich. Both are excellent options. The turkey club is sliced into four sections and contains generous slices of avocado and a mildly spicy chipotle mayonnaise. The whole grain bread is lightly toasted. In addition to your sandwich, you receive a side salad with a mix of corn, tomato, and strawberry. As part of the Gibson&#39;s chain of restaurants, you can expect a high quality meal here.Hugo&#39;s also has an extensive wine and cocktail menu. My favorite drink to date is the French martini. It is a beautiful pink drink adorned with thick froth on top. The main flavoring is raspberry, but there are hints of other fruits as well.For a great fine dining experience in Downtown Naperville, visit Hugo&#39;s Frog Bar &amp; Fish House for either lunch or dinner."hugos-frog-bar-and-fish-house-naperville,Joe P.,SAcMLGc2yRsuk0v6S7ELNg,"Dupage County, IL",1,1,1,33,146,sPRGgC01a86WfI-Dbt3W2g,4,24/01/16,"Came to Hugo&#39;s on the recommendation from the gibsons restaurant group.

Both times were memorable. This restaurant is decked out as your modern day steak house for the most part. It has plenty of woodwork but it is not dark like the so called &#34;old days&#34;. It has white tablecloths and a classy atmosshere. Â The service here is top shelf. Â No question that this is a great place for an upscale or special occasion dinner.The menu has plenty of options for the carnivore and non meat eater alike. The appetizer selections are very nice and upscale. We tried the lump crab cake, yelllowfin tuna tartar, firecracker shrimp and the crabmeat avacado. They were all excelent. I also tried the Bookbinders soup which is a tomato based broth chocked full of seafood. Unique and very good. I also tried the iceburg wedge for a change of pace. This was a good one with plenty of bacon, tomato and blue cheese. The steaks and seafood speak for themselves such as the prime tomahawk, porterhouse and Dover sole. The sides are good as well especially the maple buron brussel sprouts.

The dinner menu is exceptional with a beautiful variety of steaks and seafood. The drink specials are always good and the wine selection is great but not overwhelming.

They do not take reservations for the patio in nice weather but when I called to let them know I would be coming in with a large group, they quickly put some tables together by the time we arrived, ten minutes later.

When we finally sold our house and the money was in the bank, we said let&#39;s go here and order whatever we want! Appetizers, drinks, desserts, the works. We were prepared to take things home to go even. I was contemplating trying every $15 dollar cocktail on the menu. Money was no object today.We went on a Saturday afternoon at 2pm with our two year old son. We were happy and excited to be there.The waiter came by and immediately asked us for our drink order. My husband ordered a nice beer. I ordered a cocktail. (Both were tasty.) A minute later, the waiter asks for our order. I was still looking at the menu when the waiter literally took the menu out of my hands. I was a little surprised, but ok, I let it go. We ordered our apps and our meal.My husband&#39;s app came first. We waited for mine and commented it would&#39;ve been nice to get them at the same time. Â Well, when we asked about it, the waiter hadn&#39;t even put in the order. Of course not, he had been in such a rush, he wasn&#39;t listening. Â The restaurant was full, but not slammed. And anyway, there&#39;s no excuse for being rushed.The meal was the same. I was still working on my app when the main course came and he tried to take my app plate away. I wasn&#39;t done! I kept it, but we thought, what&#39;s the rush?Towards the end of our meal, the waiter already brought the hot towels for our hands. We were not done yet. He mumbled, &#34;Room for dessert?&#34; Uh, no thanks.I never ordered more than one drink. We didn&#39;t stay for coffee or dessert. We decided to go somewhere else instead for that.The food was delicious. Everything we ordered was very good. But the service was super rushed.

Life was just simply bright up a lot.Heard nice things about this place from a few friends and came across after I checked out other clothing stores on the same block. The entry was elegant and same size as other stores next to it. The inside was quite big and reminded me of Gibson&#39;s at Oakbrook. I liked Dark wood borders and frames on the wall with white table clothes. The lunch crowd was already there.I ordered my clam chowder soup and Frog legs as main dish as my friend recommended. The soup was served within 3 minutes. Great texture and flavorful. A little bit heavy and salty. Main course was perfect. The frog was grilled to a nice golden brown and topped with minced garlic and butter(my best guess). The meat was tender and not overloaded with seasoning. Just simple and wonderful. The side were green beans and rice. Green beans were cooked just right which did not like so often i got the overcooked mushy green beans. And green beans was not season but goes perfectly with the garlic and butter source on frog legs. Happy lunch indeed.My server was great. He was so polite and came only at the right time.

Â Even something as simple as the house salad received rave reviews from the guests - the lettuce was fresh, bountiful, and dressed with a savory herb vinaigrette which guests continue to talk about. Â The main course was equally delectable. Â I chose the &#34;Grilled Whitefish,&#34; which was delicate, yet flavorful and perfectly seasoned. Â Others at my table commented on how fantastic their dishes tasted; those dishes were the &#34;Marinated Beef Tenderloin Kabob&#34; and &#34;Cajun Chicken &amp; Crab with Andouille Sausage.&#34; Â I can&#39;t speak to the desserts (Key Lime Pie and Chocolate Mousse Cake) because I never got to taste them - more on that in the Cons section below.This event was held in the separate back room across the patio, which is a great space for private events because it has its own separate entrance and guests don&#39;t have to walk through the entire restaurant to get there. Â Hugo&#39;s also printed up personalized menus (see pic) which added a nice touch to our shower.CONS: Â The room was set up in a nonsensical manner. Â The room was lopsided with all the tables being squished to one side of the room. Â One of the dinner tables was literally three feet from the bar. Â Can you imagine having 60+ guests crammed into a 3 foot diameter waiting for a drink - it&#39;s not fun. Â And it just didn&#39;t make sense seeing as there was ample space on the opposite side of the room to spread every thing out.As I mentioned, this was for my baby shower which is why my mom requested a long table for gifts. Â Again, this simple request was not given any thought; the gift table was put in the corner of the room, directly next to the bar, halfway behind a large palm tree, and only two - I repeat, TWO - feet from the table where guests were eating. Â This made absolutely no sense. Â There was barely enough room for me and my baby bump to stand much less space to open gifts! Â Five of my guests had to move themselves and take their chairs to another table during the gift-opening because I would have been hitting them on the head every time I picked up a gift from the table. Â Even after my guests moved, there was still barely room to open and show gifts; we had to waste time clearing our guests&#39; table of all cups and glasses because I was afraid I&#39;d knock over someone&#39;s wine glass - very frustrating. Â I don&#39;t know what our event planner was thinking - has she never been to a shower before?! Doesn&#39;t she know you need at least four or five feet in each direction to move around and open gifts?! Â I feel like she put absolutely no thought into the setup for our event; it&#39;s like she just did her bare minimum job of getting a head count and having 65 meals prepared.I mentioned earlier I would come back to the desserts. Â I have a sweet tooth and absolutely love dessert! . . . which is why I was so upset I didn&#39;t get to taste any at my own shower. Â The servers purposefully waited to serve the desserts (desserts which were included in the meal package my parents paid for, by the way) until well after our guests had filled up on the beautiful shower cake my mom brought. Â Only after the ginormous cake my mom brought was completely eaten, did the servers then bring small plates of Hugo&#39;s dessert for each table to share. Â Maybe I&#39;m paranoid, but that seems like a cheap way to skimp out on your obligation to provide dessert. The cake my mom brought was pretty much for tradition/show and for people to take home a piece if they want. Â The restaurant desserts should have been served first since they were part of the meal package paid for by my parents. Â By the time Hugo&#39;s served the desserts I was already well into opening presents, and by the time I said good-bye to all my guests the desserts were cleared off the table . . . so no dessert for this baby mama : (Also, my mom and the ladies at her table had to ask three times for more coffee after dinner and were then told it would take 20 minutes to get more coffee. Â Not a huge deal, but still - how hard is it to have coffee ready with dessert?Bottom line: Â Great food. Â Private event planners need to pay more attention to detail."hugos-frog-bar-and-fish-house-naperville,Joshua P.,VaeHRwtSq4xP1qkSrji7Lw,"Centralia, PA",0,1,0,0,1227,suUDsurwryUvZs7YL-LDQw,2,28/01/16,"Incredible service and food to complement.

Â I attempted to take a quick break from the office - my mission was to make a return at a shop in downtown Naperville and then grab lunch. Â I ended up having a lot of trouble finding parking, and after waiting in line at the store, I told myself I&#39;d have lunch at the FIRST place I came across.Standing at the intersection, I saw QBBQ, which looked packed. Â And then I saw Hugo&#39;s Frog Bar, which I somehow knew would not be nearly as busy. Â I forged ahead and assumed they would have some kind of moderately priced lunch menu.The &#34;lunch menu&#34; offers salads, sandwiches, and bigger plates like steaks and fish, but there weren&#39;t any nice lunch &#34;deals,&#34; just regular sized portions at regular menu prices.I took a seat at the bar and perused the menu. Â I ordered a Pear Martini ($15), because I cannot resist any drink with St. Germain. Â Even if it&#39;s $15, and even if I have to be back at work in less than an hour, I cannot resist! Â The drink was strong for a lunch break. Â I liked the drink, but not enough to order it again. Â Usually drinks with St. Germain are slightly sweet and refreshing, but this drink was more POW! ALCOHOL! than anything else.For lunch I ordered the Steak Sandwich ($16), cooked medium-well. Â The steak was cooked perfectly, and it was served on a French bread roll with garlic butter. Â The steak was a whole slab of rib eye, so it was impossible to eat sandwich-style, so I took to my fork &amp; knife. Â The bread was nearly impossible to cut through. Â The sandwich was served with shoestring fries with a tasty seasoning as well as a pickle spear.Service at the bar was great. Â James was friendly and attentive. Â During the lunch hour, Hugo&#39;s wasn&#39;t too busy so there were a lot of servers hanging out at the end of the bar chatting. Â I heard one of the waitresses crack a joke using the word &#34;autistic,&#34; so you&#39;re bound to hear a lot of crass shit come out of their mouths if you sit anywhere near the end of the bar like I did.My meal was delicious, but perhaps not worth the price tag with so many other upscale steakhouses and fish places in the suburbs.

For majority of them fine dining is unknown experience and hence it is not wonder that Hugo&#39;s Frog Bar and Fish House in downtown Naperville is well-hidden jewel which remains undiscovered and yet unfairly poorly rated.What more one can expect from a restaurant that offers superior service, unbeatable freshens of fish and seafood Â and perfectly cooked hearty dishes. However, what certainly won&#39;t happen after eating a perfect meal, the price is not going to be low. However, each dollar they charge at Hugo&#39;s makes perfect sense. Obviously this is too much for people from Midwest who are used on food quality and service from big chain restaurants where the only focus is how to fill your stomach.Unquestionably, Hugo&#39;s in downtown Naperville, is a top notch FIVE STAR restaurant which offers unique dining experience and atmosphere.

When conducting the food presentation, he appeared to have a genuine love for food and pride in the products Hugo&#39;s serves. My sister is on the no gluten craze,rather than getting a bogus menu, he told her she may order whatever she like and ensured the chefs would make a great meal for her. He was funny and a little goofy, which made my crazy dad relax for once. The staff truly seem to take an interest in the guests overall experience, which can be hard to come by sometimes.We all had great meals. Steaks, oysters,and incredibly fresh fish were all enjoyed. I recommend fresh oysters, the crab meat and avocado appetizer, filets or ribeyes, and just about any of their fresh fish options. Their soups are to die for. Paskel mentioned everything is made from scratch in their kitchen, and it&#39;s obvious. GET a martini, they make the best in town.

The sandwich is good, but I was way more impressed with their giant double baked potato I had for a side. It comes with cheese and bacon on top of it, and is probably the best baked potato I have had. It was fluffy and soft unlike other baked potatoes which can be hard and plain.

And despite dating for over six years, we were waiting to get engaged, so our engagement was so impromptu that we didn&#39;t even have a ring; his mother actually gave us one of her own for the occasion. It&#39;s kind of a sad, but still very sweet story, and I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way.Despite living out of a hospital, we decided to take a break and celebrate it properly. Christina was our server, and she was incredible throughout the whole night and made sure that our evening was unforgettable. We were just honest with her about our bittersweet engagement, and I was floored with how amazingly we were treated by Christina and the manager. I was all set on the filet mignon, but Christina&#39;s presentation of the different cuts changed my mind, and I had no regrets on my selection of the Chicago cut steak.Everything was cooked perfectly, and Christina&#39;s wine pairing selection was spot on, as well. Much to our surprise, our dessert was plated especially for our engagement, complete with candles to make wishes. Christina also went out of her way to take a few pictures of us, which I was able to show to Mom in the hospital. As though our night wasn&#39;t special enough, our appetizer, dessert, and champagne were comped, which was completely unexpected.Truly, a night I will never forget, and I look forward to anniversaries at Hugo&#39;s. I cannot pay high enough compliments to the staff and management, nor have I ever had a dining experience as wonderful as that night was. My mother enjoyed all our our pictures and was so happy that we were able to celebrate our engagement properly as per her wishes. She died one week later at age 54, 3 months shy of her 30th wedding anniversary, with four kids aged 28, 26, 22, and 20.

Hugo is a chump...I was here with a colleague this evening and can only describe our dinner as sub par. So, the appetizer of Tuna Poke was good. I wouldn&#39;t rate it as great, but it was tolerable- bits of tuna overpopulated with under ripe mango and pineapple. The wine list is over priced with mediocre bottles priced way above want market rate should be. For my dinner I ordered the strip cooked &#39;Pittsburgh&#39; style and got a medium well steak. The only positive was the waitstaff. James and Fanny were outstanding servers.

Their menu is updated daily since ours was dated and I was &#39;well that&#39;s different&#39; the skewers were very good. Almost had a thai influence with the broth and the lemongrass flavour.

My main course was terrible. I got the fish tacos which looked so beautiful but as soon as I took my first bite I knew what a terrible terrible mistake I had made. The tortilla fought the fish and made it taste dirty, I know it sounds crazy but it did, so I discarded the shell. I was then left with a tasteless white fish (there was absolutely no seasoning at all on it) and no matter what I tried it with I was left disappointed..I tried it plain, with lime, with cole slaw, salted, with salsa, with tartar sauce..nothing helped. I felt defeated and underwhelmed munching on my tasteless tacos.Note to Hugo&#39;s: For being such an upscale restaurant I was a bit upset to see there wasn&#39;t a gluten free bread option when you have a gluten free menu. Places that charge a third of your prices offer that option so why don&#39;t you?

Â I&#39;d definitely go back for the cocktails. Â If only the food was on par with the drinks and service!We tried the calamari, frog legs and mussels for appetizer. Â The calamari was the best of the bunch. Â It was seasoned well and came with a more interesting sauce than the typical cocktail or marinara sauce. Â The frog legs were decent, but slight too buttery. Â The mussels were the tiniest I&#39;ve ever seen. Â I&#39;m not sure how they managed to get such tiny mussels, you&#39;d think there would be one medium sized one thrown in by mistake! Â Think, 10% the size of the shell. Â The flavor of the broth was different and nice but somehow didn&#39;t really go into the mussels. Â The bread dipped in the sauce was good, but the tiny mussels were just a phantom of chewiness between bites.The lobster roll looked great, but had too much mayo and not enough of the dill/brightness to offset the lobster and mayo. Â The roll was good but a bit soggy. Â The fries that came with were inconsistently crisp but seasoned well. Â They were like McDonalds fries that were left in the bag. Â The tomahawk steak was cooked right, but bland. Â I didn&#39;t try it but someone thought the tuna was the best dish we got that night.Overall, the drinks were fantastic but the food was not good enough for the price.

As soon as we sat, someone came and filled our water glasses and brought bread.The service was ok, our server Stacy was very friendly and helpful when she was at the table, but she didn&#39;t come back as often as I would have liked.The shrimp cocktail was AMAZING..$4 a piece and comes on a huge bed of ice with lemon, cocktail sauce and horseradish. I also had the loaded wedge salad that was delicious! For my entree I got the crab cake sandwich, which I was not a fan of. It was a little too fishy for my taste..but it was large and came on a bun with mayo, lettuce, tomato and onion. The fries were amazing, seasoned very well.My boyfriend had the sliders and this was really our only big problem at dinner. He ordered 2 hamburger sliders PLAIN, well done and 1 filet slider well done. None of the meat was even medium well, it was very very pink. We sent it back and waited about 10 minutes. When it came out again, it was still pink and the burgers were not plain. He&#39;s a picky eater so he didn&#39;t finish and Stacy apologized and took it off the bill. The seasoned kettle chips that came with the sliders were delicious, however.For dessert we got the mud pie, which was fantastic. I can&#39;t even explain it..but it was big enough for 4 people, no joke. We had to take 2 slices home.I also had the dragonberry lemonade, which was Bacardi of some sort with lemonade and it was really good. It was $10, which was the cheapest on the menu, some of the drinks were upwards of $17 each which seems ridiculous.I also liked that valet was free, although we did park in a garage around the corner.

It will have more body and flavor then your typical American style chinese food, and a touch spicy"mapo-restaurant-naperville-2,Lacy J.,Obw0dnrP1DZAn40eKoEVXA,"Bremerton, WA",0,1,0,0,207,RIUgxSO62MQ2uJY3SaMCLA,5,22/07/16,"We ordered the Spicy Beef Noodle Soup and the Mapo Tofu for takeout. The soup came in a quart container with noodles on the side, which is a ridiculous amount of food for 8.95. It was fantastic, the beef came in big chunks that just fell apart, the noodles were perfectly done and had cilantro and green onion on top, and the broth was amazing, kinda reminiscent of a hot and sour soup but way better. The Mapo tofu was also a huge portion (big container of tofu and rice on the side) and equally as good. The tofu wasn&#39;t how I normally like it(pressed and fried to give it more texture) but it was still delicious, it was softer, and kind of fell apart in your mouth.

Normally I would not venture way out in the middle of nowhere to get Chinese food. But I would go back, if I had 50 minutes each way to drive to nowheresville. If you live way out here, I would recommend this restaurant.This is family style with a lazy Susan in the middle of the table and we ended up with a million entrees. 3 kinds Of Mushrooms was good although bland. The wife found that it was good mixed with tofu.Shrimp with basil was also good.There were two soups, sizzling rice/chicken soup and tofu soup. The chicken soup was good, but the tofu soup tasted like nothing.The egg rolls were the frozen Sysco variety and unimpressive. There should be higher quality rolls or remove then from the menu.One obviously fresh item was the green beans. They were well cooked and seasoned.The Mongolian beef was good. We also had balls of fried chicken but I don&#39;t know what to call them. They were good.

It was very nice; the hot and sour were well balanced and not overpowering. For our main dishes, my wife had the Mongolian beef and I had the yu shan chicken. The beef in my wife&#39;s dish was very flavorful she very much enjoyed this dinner course. The yu shan chicken I had was nicely spiced and tasted good. The black mushrooms were very nice. The wait staff was attentive and the dinner was served with complementary tea. My only critique is that the restaurant was a little too quiet. Â I know that seems odd, but it was almost silent as we dined.

That being said, many of the menu items are spicy. I came here with a group of 8 and some of those dining with me could only eat select dishes that we ordered (we decided on family style) because they were intolerant to spicy foods.Three delicacies: this was probably gobbled down the fastest because it was a dish everyone could enjoy--it included shrimp, chicken, scallop, squid, beef and Chinese vegetables.Mapo tofu: although the restaurant is known for this dish, I was impartial to it and I probably wouldn&#39;t order it again.Fish fillet and mushroom in sour pickle sauce: most of us enjoyed this dish. It does come out almost soup-like.Yu shan eggplant: most of us either liked it or hated it--there was no in between. Those that hated it thought it was bland, but I thought that the eggplant was flavorful and was cooked just right.The owners were not too pleased when we tried to split the bill amongst us and we wanted to each pay with credit cards since the transaction fee is high (sorryyy) so one person paid with a credit card for the group."mapo-restaurant-naperville-2,Eric T.,OnokeZCV5JPZgZw3eTsSgg,"Manhattan, NY",1,1,1,265,76,aLKzA3PkQN42vBczHspBbw,4,07/09/14,"Best Chinese food in Naperville hands down. Used to live around the area and I&#39;ve been to all Chinese restaurants and this one is it. It&#39;s a bit pricier here, but the quality and selection makes up for it. A lot of nice authentic dishes here. I really like the mapo tofu, shui zhu fish, and beef noodle soup.In this particular last visit, we ordered the tian fu tofu, pickled cabbage and fish soup, and garlic shrimp. We came for a really late lunch, and the food came out in less than 10 minutes.Tian Fu Tofu - I like how soft the tofu is and the flavoring is authentic as it can get. Spicy and salty and heavily sauced. Goes great with rice. However, I could never finish this in a setting because it is a serious diet killer.Pickled Cabbage and Fish Soup - A pretty simple dish but delicious and healthier. I love the pickled taste of the soup and there is also glass noodles. I like to add white pepper to this giving a kick of heat. The fish is your typical fish fillet, nothing fancy.Garlic Shrimp - I really like the crust of the deep fried shrimp here. It&#39;s a bit more crunchy and thick. Plenty of garlic flavor coming from the sauce. I thought the sauce was a bit too salty.

Going in for lunch is a great deal, as you get a soup, an egg roll, and a full meal for like $10. Getting take-out from here for dinner though has been hit or miss. The orange chicken is exceptionally strange. It&#39;s like ground up chicken formed into meatballs and then deep fried? They were surprisingly difficult to eat.

Â My husband did enjoy the (very) Spicy Beef Soup.We waited forever for our food to be served and when it finally came out, after asking about it a few times, they served one dish at a time with several minutes in between each dish so we weren&#39;t able to enjoy our food together. Â It was odd that everyone around us (many people who arrived after us) were getting their food quicker and all at once....it must have been what they ordered.There are at least 10 places in the area that have better food and much better service than Mapo (Joy Yee is one of them and right down the street).

I looked over their lunch menu and prices are cheap, around $7 bucks.You get a lot for the price. I went with the orange chicken and wow. I got a nice size of deliciously chunked chicken in a fresh, rich, and spicy orange glaze sauce. This was paired with the perfect amount of fried rice and golden brown crab rangoon.

Â They have some interesting-sounding non-veg selections, such as frog, or tofu with pork blood. Â Veg items included the Vegetable Delight, which I found more interestingly spiced than at many places; General Tso&#39;s Tofu (have not seen this elsewhere), and the Basil Tofu, which is just as good as everyone else said. Â They even have a potato dish, which is essentially fried potato shreds with a couple of scallions sprinkled over them. Â Tasty, but would be disappointing if your only entree.They&#39;re not the most flexible; I asked if I could get the Eggplant in Garlic Sauce and make it Eggplant and Green Beans in Garlic Sauce (&#34;No,&#34; said our waitress), but they were willing to add vegetables to my tofu for a $1 upcharge. Â Since most of the tofu dishes are basically tofu in sauce, you may want to consider this. Â The Basil Tofu is spicy, with hits of garlic, and the Vegetarian Chicken goes one better than some other Chinese places and stuffs the tofu skin with mushrooms. Â Nice.

I still try to come here, but since I live so close to Chinatown, it isn&#39;t a priority to come here. This place is pretty good for the most part. It is definitely comparable to the Lao&#39;s chain in Chinatown, but I like this place slightly more. What we always order...Mapo Beef Rolls - They are wrapped in foil, but they are just okay for the most part. Sometimes the wrap is really crunchy and you can&#39;t really taste the beef. I would still recommend this because all the other times they were pretty good.Dry Chili Chicken - Breaded chicken cooked with tons of red peppers. This dish is my favorite thing here and it always deliver! It is not too spicy like other places and the breading is mostly perfect. The last time I was here, the breading was a little too crunchy.Mongolian Beef - They are not shady with the amount of beef they give you. The beef is also nice and tender. Not chewy like other places.Mapo Tofu - This dish is extremely spicy for me, but I absolutely love it.Seared Fish Fillet - This fish fillet is cooked with garlic sauce and it is not drenched in sauce like most places. Definitely a must try if you are looking for a fish fillet entree.Overall, I don&#39;t think anything you get here can be too bad. Everything we tried was pretty good."mapo-restaurant-naperville-2,Cindy L.,sp3fVbTAv7q390toVTEN9g,"Aurora, IL",0,1,0,0,6,wEewpOj2t8NctAbwHB49xQ,4,26/12/14,I have had takeout twice from Mapo.

When driving by one night I noticed Mapo Restaurant and decided to give it a try with no idea of what they served beforehand. I came in, was greeted, seated and looked over the menu and was pleased to discover they are a fairly traditional Chinese restaurant.As I looked over the menu I settled on two of my favorite Chinese dishes, Crab Rangoon as an appetizer, and General Tso&#39;s chicken as the entree. I then sat and admired the atmosphere, the place is very clean with lots of employees visible at all times, for such a small place it almost seemed a bit overstaffed. It&#39;s also a little on the dark side inside with very minimal lighting. I find that to be plesant but that might not be everyone&#39;s cup of tea.Within a few minutes the crab rangoon was brought out to me, and it was pretty good. It was well breaded and had a nice cheese to meat balance. I&#39;ve definitely had better crab rangoon before, but this was well above average. Then came the General Tso&#39;s chicken, on the plus side this chicken tasted excellent with a nice more sweet than hot sauce mixed in with vegetables. On the down side I had more than a few pieces of chicken that were tougher than I would expected as though they were dried out or overcooked.Overall I was pleased with my visit to Mapo Restaurant, my food was good, the service was excellent. It was a little pricier than some other, admittedly not as well decorated Chinese restaurants that have equal or better food. Based on that I&#39;m going to award it three stars. It&#39;s worth visiting if you&#39;re in the area and willing to spend a little more for the sake of ambiance."mapo-restaurant-naperville-2,Bradley C.,bsNPOZzmhJJQ8U4V4QDYIQ,"Naperville, IL",0,1,0,14,3,ZmNBApnTYtG_hIdnLGhNXA,3,13/02/16,"our &#39;go to&#39; in naperville.

Simply decorated, yet cozy- woven together delicately with some mild Chinese instrumentals. The menu is extensive and provides pictures of highlighted items. I ordered the broiled beef in hot Sichuan sauce (picture was provided), when it came out (came out fast) it was identical to the picture in the menu. The beef was succulent and flavorful- rich in garlic, and red pepper- the green onions and cabbage really enhanced the flavor sensation- beautiful dish! I was astounded with how tender the beef was, the quality of the meat was very good and you could tell.We also ordered the American favorite- Crispy chicken in tangy sweet sauce. I will say the dish was tasty no doubt, but it was a tad too crispy, needed more actual chicken than the fried batter. This minor set back definitely did not over shadow our great experience and our desire to come back. I plan on digging into their seafood portion of the menu next time we go.

My boyfriend and I were so excited to go to our favorite Joy Yee Noodles in Naperville until were drove up and realized it was closed. So we looked at asian restaurants in the area, and according to the reviews, this was the best place around. We walked in, and immediately, the place was not impressive. The hostess seemed very bored and uninterested in us. After we requested a table for two we had to awkwardly stand there because the lady just walked off, did not say ANYTHING. Ok.So we get seated and the table is dirty... there is a piece of rice laying on it which the hostess takes with her hand and throws on the floor right in front of us.... all righty then. We order our food from a menu what was NOTHING compared to the options you get at Joy Yee (i miss that place so much). Our food arrived and it was nothing exciting our authentic looking. It did not taste special, in fact, it was all very boring. The noodle based dished very VERY heady on noodles, which are cheap but also extremely plain...go figure. All I could say is that after we finished eating, I wished we had never started. There is nothing worse than paying money and forcing your body to digest something less than enjoyable...nothing makes you realize more that life is short, and every meal should be enjoyed, especially the ones you pay money for. The interior of this place is plain gross. FYI- it does not take much money to patch up the holes in Â your walls and give them a fresh coat of paint. Call me picky- but I consider my time and money to be precious, I do not ever want to waste it on businesses like this. The ones that treat me like they are doing me a favor by seating my at a table that&#39;s not clean and serving me food that I later regretted eating. No thanks. Never again. #JoyYeeForLifeOne thing I forgot to mention, the main thing actually:When my boyfriend and I sat down, we were given plates and ....forks. Now, there is nothing wrong with forks, but we were at an asian restaurant where majority of the customers were asian, and ALL of them were eating with chop sticks. We were not even given the option of using chop sticks, which I found very offensive and discriminative.

It was tasty. The only thing I didn&#39;t like? The presentation... It was wrapped in tin foil, and it looked like something out of an alien movie to me. But I guess that&#39;s what it&#39;s supposed to look like...We also ordered Mapo&#39;s special mapo tofu with fish. This was delicious as well. I had never had mapo tofu with fish, only with ground pork or vegetarian. The fish was an interesting take on the traditional mapo tofu dish. I liked it a lot.My friends introduced me to a dish called Wu Geng Chang Wang. They were surprised I&#39;ve never had it before, as it&#39;s supposedly one of the most popular dishes in Asia. Huh? It&#39;s a pot of spicy offal stew. In it were preserved mustard, tofu, pork intestine slices and congealed pork blood cubes. Yum? I liked it, but I&#39;m sure that most people wouldn&#39;t.The last two dishes I mentioned were spicy but not too much. I thought it had the right amount of spiciness, but my boyfriend continued to add more and more hot chili oil. That was surprising to me because these dishes were practically swimming in hot chili oil! I also thought the offal stew was just a tad more spicy than the mapo tofu even though to be quite honest, after eating the two together, the taste kind of became one. The offal stew also reminded me very slightly of the Mexican menudo dish (probably because of the offal) except that I did enjoy the addition of the slightly sour taste of the preserved mustard (FYI, I don&#39;t like menudo at all). I Â thought the mustard and the tofu helped to tone down the off-putting smell of the offal.For our &#34;non-spicy&#34; dish, we ordered the Sichuan green beans. Sichuan is known for their spicy food, but this was the mildest food item (aside from the appetizer) that we got. This was pretty good too, but it was nothing spectacular.I&#39;d come back if I am ever in the neighborhood again."mapo-restaurant-naperville-2,Grass W.,rnb4CBvmq91cx3puqxe37Q,"Carol Stream, IL",0,1,0,0,11,qGsg3tEqCR3wouZthtSPPg,4,15/02/15,Best Chinese restaurant around Chicago areamapo-restaurant-naperville-2,YouDontknow Y.,ZX5xA3Mcp6xVx_6yKSvzTQ,"Lincolnshire, IL",0,1,0,0,190,loP2Le0mt-BwEgQHw5cWQw,5,27/07/14,"We ordered Happy Marriage beef ;P, Mapo tofu, Tianfu tofu and Boiled beef.

In fact, this is the ONLY reason we kept coming. What I find really strange however is that every time the service has been really terrible, even by Chinese restaurant standards.The first time we came, our food came in one hour late because our waiter had forgotten to give our order to the kitchen. Hey I understand shit happens, you&#39;re overworked etc. But after we left, our waiter ran out after us asking us why we didn&#39;t tip, something I have never experienced before in my life....The second time we came, they got our order wrong.The third time we came in around 9 pm. Mapo&#39;s closing time is 10 pm, but they were already turning off the lights and in the process of closing the store. The wait staff was obviously pissed that they couldn&#39;t close early and asked why we were eating so late, telling us to order faster, etc etc. while we were thereLook I understand that wait staff are underpaid, overworked, etc, and I sympathize. All I want is to get my order delivered to my table without feeling like I am being treated like shit. We see the same wait staff every time we go to Mapo and therefore we know we can consistently expect shitty service. We refuse to go to this restaurant anymore.

The interior is very comfortable and welcoming.The host was very nice and polite and even opened the restaurant early for us. It was our first time and we walked in on a whim.There was a very nice young gentleman waiting on our party, and he made our experience! He explained any menu questions we had, provided us with prompt and helpful service, and was nothing but polite.We tried the panang curry, chop suey, and sesame chicken, and our meals were delicious and HUGE in portion. The leftovers we took home fed each of us for two to three meals after what we are in the restaurant.We ordered their bo bo appetizer plate and were not disappointed! Or server brought it out with a little mini fire to keep our food warm and to have a hands on experience I definitely enjoyed. It came with beef on a stick, BBQ pork, fried shrimp, and crab Rangoon, and egg rolls. It feeds two but three of us shared very comfortably. So good!I ordered the panang curry medium and it was just the right amount of heat, and I ordered with a combination of meat and only paid about $10-$11 - for a total of four meals from this one plate! It comes with delicious mushrooms, carrots, and pea pods, a sauce, and your choice of meat.When we paid for our meal and thanked the host, he asked if we ever tried their smoothies.

Â Our orders are typically accurate, hot and delivered timely and the food is tasty.At the same time, the issues are fixable! Â If the egg rolls get any smaller they will just be shell &amp; no filling. Â Same with the beef on a stick - the beef isn&#39;t much bigger than the stick! Â Offer two sizes at different price points. Â This way we can still get the former full versions if we opt to pay a fair price. Â Similarly, the free chicken fried rice has reeled many customers in since the beginning but it has become chickenless. Â Once I ordered an actual order of chicken fried rice &amp; got the free one. Â Comparably, they seemed to be two different batches entirely.Chinese Entrees are usually great! We haven&#39;t tried the other menus much. Â One suggested way to cut some cost might be to decrease the amount of white rice per meal. Â We always have one untouched large carton, if not more, left after the entrees are gone. Â We also never use a good amount of the packaged sauces (soy or orange stuff).

Luckily Tai San is no more than a ten minute drive from her. The three star review is based upon our most recent visit which just so happened to be last night.Usually I like to order the Chinese dishes from here but I decided to go out on a whim and try one of their thai dishes since I love Thai food. Let me just begin by saying that I made a Â huge mistake. I ordered Pad Thai, the lady friend Mongolian Beef (which I&#39;ve had in the past and is absolutely delicious). She also ordered some Crab Rangoons. Â My Pad Thai was nowhere near close to the Pad Thai I&#39;m used to from the authentic Thai places around my house (I live in the Glenview/Northbrook area). It came with a disgusting looking almost neon orange sauce which tasted spicy and sour. Those were the only two flavors I could taste. The dish had none of the layers of flavor I&#39;m used to in Thai food. I ended up finishing no more than a few bites of my huge portion and threw the rest away because it was so bad. The few bites I had of the girlfriend&#39;s Mongolian Beef though, were delicious and did not disappoint.One other gripe that I had was that the quality of food does not justify the 30 dollar price tag I paid for the meal. I don&#39;t know the Downers Grove/Woodridge/Darien areas all that well but I&#39;m sure there are other Chinese and/or Thai restaurants that blow this place out of the water. I don&#39;t see us being back any time soon but if we do, I just won&#39;t make the mistake of ordering anything from their Thai menu. In my opinion this place should stick to Chinese food and Chinese food only because as other reviews have noted, you can&#39;t be good at everything."tai-san-chef-darien,Patrick W.,4DGS5a672exxLJAQVkfmIQ,"Lombard, IL",0,1,1,90,56,dLuw95nOk2zZXyV4LC2BUQ,3,19/10/14,"There&#39;s no way that I can compete with Candice&#39;s review so like Bart Simpson, I&#39;ll have to be happy underachieving.Brought my 3 month old here for lunch while my wife was at work.

I tried a variety of dishes and items and was in general happy with what I received.The eggdrop soup (with corn) and hot and sour soups were a little above average. There was a little more care than normal put into the preparation but didn&#39;t make a strong impression.The smoothies were surprisingly good. Few places outside of Chinatown get a good mix of flavor without being excessively sweet. The biggest surprise was that the tapioca (boba) was both soft and properly separated. Many places outside of Chinatown tend to freeze the boba instead of preparing it fresh, resulting in suboptimal texture and clumping.The beef chow fun was probably the best dish with thick rice noodles that were fried to be very crispy. This was paired with tasty, tender beef.The crispy duck was prepared exactly as advertised -- crispy. Like the beef chow fun, I felt like I was eating Chinese junk food (but it tasted so good I couldn&#39;t tell myself to stop).The Szechuan string beans were also a solid choice with good flavor and texture.The item I was disappointed by was the shrimp pad thai. It was prepared in a almost Hong Kong style tomato sauce and didn&#39;t taste bad, but I was hoping for a contrast in flavor.Overall, a solid choice if you&#39;re in the area or you want a bit different flavor from the cuisine you get in Chinatown."tai-san-chef-darien,Cynthia A.,vG15QXPr0FyHAZg54SFTUA,"Chicago, IL",0,1,0,56,414,M30POQUdBY6duGhKO0ulYA,4,04/01/16,"Ok so this place is good. The food is always satisfying and the portions are always generous. But goddamn does the service just lack EVERY TIME. The waitresses always have to be called over whether I need a refill on my drink, or need to order, ask for hot sauce, or get the bill... whatever it is, I&#39;m always waving people down. I&#39;ve also noticed (I don&#39;t know how this is possible but I swear to God it&#39;s true) that the waitress always eats her lunch or takes her break in the middle of her shift while serving us. It doesn&#39;t matter what waitress we get, when I&#39;m ready for the bill or ready to order and look around, she will be right there at the back of the restaurant eating. I&#39;m all about people getting their break but if you&#39;re going to go on break, how about telling another waitress to take watch of your table. Today I had to get up and go over to the sushi side to get chopsticks and a soy tray myself so I wouldn&#39;t disturb this girls lunch. Not only that, she took so long to come get the bill that I just walked it up to the register to pay myself as well.

Â Before I go any further, I have to say that for me the saving grace of this place is their fresh fruit smoothies that are on par with Joy Yee.They offer some good lunch specials and also have Japanese, Thai and Chinese cuisine all conveniently in one location. Â It usually scares me when a restaurant claims to be able to make foods from three different places, and my instinct was not that far off in this instance. Â I mean, you can&#39;t be good at all three. Â It just isn&#39;t possible and personally I think they should cross Japanese off the list.I ordered the lunch special of a spicy salmon roll and a couple of pieces of salmon sushi. Â I also got a specialty roll, the Red Dragon to try something else. Â My lunch came with a bowl of miso soup which was probably my favorite food item. Â My spicy salmon roll and the Red Dragon which were supposed to be spicy weren&#39;t. Â In fact all of the sushi lacked flavor overall. Â I wondered if maybe the fish wasn&#39;t fresh and that is why the food lacked flavor. Â The only thing that I could taste were the cucumbers inside the roll and the sauce on top of it.The service was good, the waitress was eager to please. Â I do wish that when I had ordered my smoothie that she had asked me if I wanted tapioca in it. Â I figured it was obvious that I did, but when she brought it to me it was missing those delicious little balls - but that was my fault for not ordering it correctly.

I could probably go a 3 star but their portion sizes are no joke, I really liked my veggie soup, and the place is unassumingly large and WAY cuter than I had expected inside.A few notables~-Their first menu page shows a bunch of photos of bubble tea and has a flavor list but says &#39;smoothies&#39;. Just to be sure, I asked my server guy and he said they don&#39;t have bubble tea, only smoothies... Bummer! Until I see a table across the way who clearly has bubble tea. I assume he made a mistake and I decided to just say the flavor I want while pointing to the bubble tea on the menu and just hoping I got what I wanted. What did I get? A plain ole frickin&#39; smoothie. LAME! What&#39;s a girl gotta do to get some boba around here?-My Spicy Basil Leaves and tofu dish wasn&#39;t very spicy and it had that super thick syrup-y sauce I&#39;ve found to be indicative of Chinese food restaurants who try to add in some Thai tastes. To me, it&#39;s just too heavy and you don&#39;t get to taste the veggies the way you would if it were the thinner Thai chili sauce.-My fortune cookie arrived broken. :(-Free (and delicious) almond cookie at the end-The place was PACKED at 6:00 on Wednesday evening-Service can run a bit behind but it appeared as if just one young guy was serving all 15 tables in the area where I was sitting. NOT an easy feat. Keep this in mind and tip well- that boy busts his ass.-Like I said earlier, the veggie soup was delish!-The spring roll order was HUGE and though not very flavorful, I did still enjoy it as a filler.I would go back to try their hibachi, sushi, or the super cheap Mai Tais I&#39;ve heard about, but I think I&#39;d stay away from the Thai food as it doesn&#39;t seem to be their specialty."tai-san-chef-darien,Rafael D.,hiSsz9Kc2ntuBPFXchXPVQ,"Darien, IL",0,1,0,0,27,ZLiveqBOSTbPFNtKyxvZsw,4,24/06/15,"I really like their food but sometimes there&#39;s glass in my soup!

Prices were all reasonable ($5.99) for the Shrimp Vegetable Lunch. Once served, realized our lunch today was going to be.... &#34;ehhh&#34;. The chicken fried rice was dry and flavorless. My shrimp broccoli was extremely hot (fresh out of the micro), and also had very little going for it in the flavor department.

Towards the end of our lunch we finally received our Shrimp Roll. 5 pieces. Noticed right away the lack of shrimp and overabundance of celery. Ehhhhh. The flavor matched its boring appearance. Lack of flavor, lack of shrimp, and the shrimp tail being left on and hidden inside one of the rolls, drove the dish straight into the ground. Luckily, some chile oil rescued what could be saved from our lunch.Long story short, go somewhere else. Unless you&#39;re in a pinch, low on funds, or don&#39;t have wheels drive, spend your time and money elsewhere."tai-san-chef-darien,Laura K.,iRevETFYFfEm_hjUcVa1dA,"Woodridge, IL",0,1,1,80,6,#NAME?,2,18/08/11,"After having three cavities filled at a nearby dentist, I was craving some some warm soup. Since Tai San was just across the parking lot, I decided to give it a try.After scanning the HUGE menu, I went with a dinner special of Thai ginger with tofu, hot and sour soup, an eggroll and fried rice. It was definitely enough food for two good-sized meals, which justified the $9.95 price tag.They asked me how hot I wanted the Thai ginger, and I told them VERY hot. Well, they delivered! It was so hot that I had tears in my eyes, which is just how I like it.I really appreciated how fresh everything was. The veggies used in my Thai ginger, as well as in my eggroll, were delicious. Unfortunately, the fried rice was just kind of meh (I spiced it up with some of my Thai ginger) and the hot and sour soup wasn&#39;t hot at all. It also had chicken in it, which seemed kind of random. I&#39;m used to it just including veggies.Oh, and I don&#39;t want this to come across the wrong way...but I love that they had a woman who was fluent in English working the register. Many times, I&#39;ve had communication difficulties at Chinese places.Overall, it was a good meal.

Â It was basically water, with raw humongous pieces of veggies floating on top. Â The mushrooms looked like it just came out of packaging the length of your thumb. Â The tomatoes were cut just as big. Â I can&#39;t believe how they would expect to charge a premium for this soup. Â Plus, it tasted nothing like Thai soup; in fact, it tasted like they just dumped seasoning and mixed it in for 5 minutes and served. So we asked the waitress if the soup was suppose to taste like this, and when she said &#34;yes!&#34;, we sent it back. Â She wasn&#39;t nice about it or seem apologetic at all.My other dish was the Pad-See Eww and the noodles came out black and burnt. Â As first I thought it&#39;s OK if it&#39;s just a few burnt strands but half of my dish was burnt. Â They also put the same white mushrooms like the ones from my soup into this noodle dish (whoever heard of mushrooms in your pad see eww?). Â But while the noodles were burnt, the mushroom was raw.So final score: it was a mistake and this place will never have my patronage again. Why? Because both the food&#39;s quality have come down to a bare minimum and that their service isn&#39;t really up to par for the price that they charge.I would have given it 2 stars but the indifferent and ill-mannered customer service just didn&#39;t leave me with a good taste in my mouth, literally.========The sushi maki seems alright but nothing too special or set apart from the ones you get in a box at a grocery store. Â Their Thai dish are not too bad, particularly the Pad See Ew. Â Their Thai curry dishes is alright too but could use more flavor and coconut intensity.I was a little disappointed in the bubble tea because it didn&#39;t taste like they used fresh fruits but powder instead. Â The bubble themselves were too soft and not chewy. Â But the bubble tea is a pretty cheap (under $3) so in that sense, you can&#39;t expect Joy Yee&#39;s standards."tai-san-chef-darien,Jeff L.,G5uELIfC-yzzqUgVZixD0Q,"Downers Grove, IL",0,1,0,3,990,g_1dr6pf8gKBx35q25UxqA,1,07/01/11,"I have been going to Tai San since it opened.

Â Their honey mustard sauce is one of their big draws and while I liked it, I didn&#39;t think it was all that. Â The samich by itself, albeit disappointing was good, not great. Â The pasta salad was good. Â I did leave there still feeling hungry. Â  My friend ordered half a reuben and half a potato with bacon &amp; cheese. The tater was huge and looked awesome.

For how crappy the roads were, this place was hopping, good sign!The menus are digital, large and includes pictures so they are easy to read. There was a line of about 4 or 5 people ahead of us so that gave us first timers a chance to look through the menu. The line went surprisingly fast and we still did not have our orders when it was our turn. I settled on the club and my dining companion had the Italian. I loved that they offer many different sides for no extra charge, like mac and cheese. Usually restaurants will charge extra but McAlister&#39;s does not. My club was very good. It definitely wasnt the best club I have ever had but still a very good meal. It was a bit smaller than I thought it would be. The honey mustard had a bit of twang that I am not sure I liked. The mac and cheese was decent as well. The Italian came out as a hot sandwich, which was surprising. I had a bite and it was very good as well, but thought it might be better as a cold sandwich. Messy sandwich as well but we were sitting near where they kept the napkins.One thing we really appriciated from the store were the many people walking around offering to get refills of drinks or bringing extra napkins. The manager noticed that we were picking things off the Italian and offered to remake the sandwich, without the red peppers.

I&#39;ve been here twice now, both times to go, but will definitely be back to eat inside too. I heard they are opening a drive-thru soon, which I will be taking full advantage of. Cleanliness and customer service are clearly major priorities here! And the food is delicious! The atmosphere is similar to a Panera, but brighter and less chaotic. Although I only ordered to go, I saw how it would be to dine in. You order at the counter where they have a beautiful digital screen overhead with many choices. Then they bring your food to your table, and clean up after you too! The staff was very attentive to everyone I saw, offering to get anything they needed like in a sit-down restaurant, but less formal and no real wait staff, just workers offering assistance to anyone who needed it. Â They were constantly making sure everything was clean and organized. While I waited for my food, which only took a few minutes even though it was quite busy, two different members of the staff asked if I needed anything and genuinely seemed to want to make sure everyone was happy.Now, for the food, I have to say it is absolutely delicious! Â It may seem pricey at first, but the quality is much better than any other sandwich or soup place that charges the same or more. The bread is fresh and tastes like homemade. I had the roast beef &amp; horseradish grilled sandwich (with awesome grilled onions), which was so good I craved it and had to go back later that week to get it again. Â My mom had a turkey sandwich and said how good it was even though she generally doesn&#39;t care much for sandwiches. My husband had the grilled chicken and although he didn&#39;t realize it came on a croissant, said it was very good. Â He also suggested we get the ultimate nachos. I was skeptical because it&#39;s a sandwich place and how good can their nachos really be? Well, the answer is really freaking good. The nacho cheese had chili in it to my delight, and the toppings were fresh and plentiful. Best nachos I&#39;ve had in a while with tons of toppings. Also, the mac &amp; cheese was an awesome side - I got it for my daughter, and kept stealing bites even though I usually don&#39;t like mac &amp; cheese much. Also, I loved the squash soup in a bread bowl! It was a bit sweet and very good! Â I was told it&#39;s seasonal, so not sure what other soups they&#39;ll be getting in, but can&#39;t wait to try them! The only things we didn&#39;t care for were the mashed potatoes - those tasted too commercial and not at all homemade. The steamed veggies could have been steamed longer too as the carrots were basically raw and too hard for my liking. But overall, they do a really good job of offering a variety of quality food.Finally, I really like that they want to ensure you have the correct order before you take it to go. One of the guys from the back brought it on a tray and transferred it to a bag as he checked off every item in front of me. The nachos were disassembled and the ingredients were in individual containers so everything would keep and you wouldn&#39;t end up with soggy chips and hot sour cream. Â Very nice touch. Same with the bread bowl. The soup came in a separate container. Wish they offered potato wedges or some sort of fries, but that&#39;s just me being nitpicky.I really think that for the quality and customer service, this place is top notch and the food is worth every penny. Â They genuinely seem to care and they either hire those with the same work ethic, or train them well as everyone was super nice and competent. Great experience and can&#39;t wait until the drive-thru opens in a week or so! What a great addition to the area!"mcalisters-deli-naperville,Karen D.,4uJmRWqWAjj6B-je1WZtHw,"Naperville, IL",0,1,1,47,11,d_qfiovi_llps7A_8v4BMA,5,02/11/15,"When trying a new restaurant I am all about the food. Â I am a big fan of sandwiches and I have frequented all of the establishments within mere steps of this new deli. Â Some are fancier than others, but when it comes down to it, the quality of the food is what brings me back time and again.McAlister&#39;s Deli has all of the right window dressing, a beautiful new building located at a busy corner of 95th Street and Route 59, and a lovely dining area. Â The entire parking area around the restaurant was very full, not just when I went, but also during the entire week as I drove past multiple times. Â They certainly are having a successful grand opening promotion!I was met with multiple smiley faces and energetic employees. Â Awesome! Â This place definitely has a nice feel good vibe to it! Â Similar to Noodles, they serve everything on real dishware, not plastic or paper.My group ordered 3 sandwiches with sides to split and try. Â Our unanimous thoughts about the food are these:1) Â Everything was very eye-appealing, the food looks just like the photos, no kidding! Â So a big A+ to the cooks/sandwich makers in this area.2) Â The sandwiches were extremely original and different then your &#34;basic&#34; ham or turkey. Â They do serve those, but we wanted to take it a step further and try some unique items: Â French Dip, Orange Cranberry Club, and New Yorker. Â We thought there were definitely many choices! Â However we felt that the New Yorker &amp; Orange Cranberry Club were a bit on the salty side. Â The meat itself in the French Dip was delicious, but the sandwich was a bit small and the au jus was bland.3) Â The breads were of a variety, we didn&#39;t make any substitutions and ordered them as presented on the menu. Â However, they were all a bit on the &#34;light&#34; side, not having the wholesomeness and aroma that I expect at this price point.4) Â The sides of Mashed Potatoes, Mac &amp; Cheese, and Potato Salad were large portions. Â However, we agreed that they needed more flavor, tasting less homemade and more pre-prepped.Overall, I feel that the McAlister&#39;s brand has large shoes to fill being new and located in a very competitive area. Â The price point for this restaurant is comparable to other sandwich shops within walking distance, fancier than some, but the size and quality of the sandwiches and sides would need to be better for me to really become a fan.In all fairness, since this is the first week of business, I will wait awhile and try again in the future. Â I&#39;m hopeful that they will impress me &amp; I will more than happily give them a higher rating!"mcalisters-deli-naperville,Shannon B.,Tt3q8SUQXLxZfW63PisidA,"Aurora, IL",0,1,0,10,32,XYTvujNYN8HUii0b5BYd3g,3,19/12/15,"Poor excuse for a deli. As a born and bred New Yorker I take offense to the term deli even being used in the title of this eatery. This place is more along the lines of a Panera but food quality is much lower. They offer sandwiches, salads, soup and baked potatoes. I ordered the nacho appetizer and chicken tortilla soup. The appetizer was a plate of low grade tortilla chips with a cup of oily cheese that looked and smelled like Velveeta. That&#39;s it for $7. The soup had no chicken in it I could see as I spooned through it. I ate one spoonful and couldn&#39;t believe how much it looked and tasted like the cheese sauce served with the nacho plate along with the same layer of oily residue on surface. I only ate one spoon of the soup however as I found a long black hair in the soup. I brought this to the attention of the assistant manager quietly and respectfully, she walked the bowl back to the kitchen where one of the workers looked at the hair and then said loudly &#34;she&#39;s complaining over that little hair?&#34; Then gave me an evil stare like I was overreacting! I asked what the size of the hair had to do with anything? The assistant manager was highly embarrassed over the kitchen workers reaction and said she&#39;d &#34;talk to her later&#34; I did at least get my $6 back for the bowl of soup.My husband had the roast beef and horseradish sandwich. His remarks &#34;bread is poor quality, cold cuts are on par with Subway, i.e. Highly processed and no flavor&#34; His sandwich was almost $10. The ice tea was good and tasted freshly brewed but that doesn&#39;t make up for the overpriced low quality food and rude staff. We will never return and several friends have asked us our take on this place knowing we are from New York and know what a real deli is like and we&#39;ve directed them to avoid this place at all costs. As a side note the assistant manager couldn&#39;t figure out how to process my refund for the &#34;soup with hair&#34; and was waiting for the head manager for direction.

We also got the bruschetta which had some good fresh tomatos, but would have been better with some balsamic vinegar.I can recommend the Caeser salad and the vodka pasta. The itallian sausage and meatballs were good as well! The only thing that looked kind of meh that the whole party got was scallops &amp; marinara dish. It just looked like there wasn&#39;t enough sauce, and the scallops were medium-sized and not big and fat.One last thing that gives Capri a big plus is the wine menu.

Service was swift, professional and thoughtful.I know I&#39;m more sensitive to &#34;background&#34; music then anyone I&#39;m hanging around with. But I just have to say...on Saturday, early evening April 4th, what was playing at an obtrusive volume was an album (I presume of) a man and woman making super cheezy duets out of otherwise awesome songs: U2, Coldplay, Snow Patrol, Tracy Chapman...all musically murdered, one after the other. It was dreadful. This REALLY didn&#39;t go with the Frank Sinatra portraits hanging on the walls. I wouldn&#39;t have been surprised at all to see Frank pull a scowl. Why not play Frank, if you&#39;re going for swank? The other 4-5 tables that were full were like my table: Parent or grandparent in their 70s or 80s and their children and grandchildren.

The food is lousy and the &#34;service&#34; is ridiculously bad. So bad in fact that several times the next day, at random, either my husband or I would just blurt out, &#34;wow that was horrible. I mean - I can&#39;t remember the last time I was in a restaurant with service that awful...&#34; etc. If we weren&#39;t there celebrating my husband&#39;s Great Aunt&#39;s 85th birthday and if it were free then we&#39;d probably be able to just laugh it off, but sadly it was her birthday and the prices were anything, but cheap. Especially considering I only received half of my entree (chicken with side of pasta = just a hammered out piece of chicken dripping in a soggy, overly sour lemon sauce). It would take a long time to go through all the bizarre and sometimes rude service-related issues AND tell you how bad the food was, so I&#39;ll just do a &#34;greatest hits&#34; of some Â of the more memorable moments from our dinner last weekend:- All of our meals came with the standard soup or salad option to be brought out before the entree. Before my soup even had a chance to cool down, our entrees started coming out. This is a crowded table too so in addition to the annoyance of having to scarf down your appetizer to avoid your entree from getting cold, the whole stacking plates to find room circus came into play. My husband&#39;s aunt kindly asked if they could hold off on serving the entrees and I swear to everything they just ignored her and kept putting food down. She asked THREE times and the servers (we had several rotating in and out throughout the night) pretended not to hear her before stopping...clearly because they saw themselves that there was no more room. Rather than take everything back, they left a few entrees on the table (including mine) which was incredibly awkward.- The food. This is some bland food, folks. The lentil soup was watery, my husband&#39;s chicken/shrimp dish had zero taste and another family member said his dish&#39;s sauce tasted like it was reheated from a can. Mine, as detailed above, was also not good. At all.- Missing items. As I mentioned earlier, my entree (Pollo Limone) was supposed to come with a side of pasta (as did all of the others) and it didn&#39;t. Drinks were ordered that never came and it took two requests to get the coffees we ordered after dessert. Even more irritating is that we were charged for everything whether it was ever brought to the table or not...which reminds me of the production that was settling our check...- I know that splitting checks is super annoying. I&#39;ve worked in restaurants. I get it. However, it was four bills and we clearly explained each of the orders, drinks, etc. that went with each check. The fuss that was made over an unclaimed diet coke (that my husband&#39;s uncle ordered but never received) was INSANE. At one point, I&#39;m like - &#34;just throw it on mine if that means we can wrap this up!&#34; but again, ignored. The server then decided to stand over our table to loudly announce that they would not be charging us for the bread. How magnanimous of you, kind establishment, to comp our bread! I don&#39;t know what the purpose of that announcement was because I&#39;ve never been charged for bread that is automatically brought to the table upon sitting down. They also loudly announced, &#34;we are not charging you for one dessert as it&#39;s someone&#39;s birthday.&#34; It was just tacky and silly. When I say announced loudly, I mean - standing over the head of the table and reading through the whole bill for no reason...and wrongly, I might add. She just made up entrees because she couldn&#39;t remember what we actually did order. Needless to say, our checks were still screwed up, but at that point, everyone just wanted to leave.I&#39;m sad that we went here and I&#39;m sad that this place exists.

In terms of food preparation, it reminds me a little more of what I find when I&#39;ve been in Italy in the past, compared to some of the more Americanized options in the area.The vitello limone is probably my favorite offering on this menu - I like lemon (citrus in general) but if someone isn&#39;t a fan, then definitely skip on this item. The mussels and linguini is fantastic, but if someone is looking for a straight pasta dish, I would always recommend the porcini mushroom sacchetti.It is a pricier option for the downtown restaurants, but the atmosphere is beautiful, the service is delightful, and I really enjoy the food. I find it well worth the pricetag."capri-of-downers-grove-downers-grove,Emily R.,2PfNH0lr-Kv6wrU-Nu7nuA,"Palos Heights, IL",1,1,0,160,20,lVmFYUaqCso11fcggZZntw,5,11/05/15,"First off I have to say I love the location. There are a ton of really cute shops and restaurants around the area you can go to for lunch or dinner after shopping. However, this restaurant is not up to par. Really not impressed with this restaurant at all. The service was pretty bad considering we barely saw our waiter. He seemed very nervous and was not friendly or welcoming at all. Later it would appear to be one of his first nights, because really that is the only explanation for some of his mistakes.We were celebrating a birthday and booked a reservation about a week in advance. The host was very nice and seated us right outside the kitchen. Not an ideal location, but one of the only areas large enough to accommodate our group so it is understandable. Our waiter introduced himself in a very monotone and flat manner, not warm or welcoming at all. We ordered two things for appetizer and he only brought one, we asked for our appetizer so many times and he said it would be out shortly. Then he would come back seeing if we needed anything and we would ask for our appetizer again. The calamari was really delicious which made me wish we could have tried the portabella mushroom di parma. Finally he came with our entrees and we never saw that second appetizer.Most of our table complained about their dishes, saying it lacked flavor, however, I enjoyed my pollo fiorentino (chicken with baby spinach, tomato, and mozzarella). It came with a side of pasta with marinara sauce and that was truly plain and not good, at all. Certainly not worth the calories so I didn&#39;t eat it. Then when we said it was our friend&#39;s birthday, they brought us a cake, but the waiter just kind of threw it on the table and said he couldn&#39;t find candles.The only reason I gave this restaurant 2 stars instead of one was because I reserve one star for honestly terrible restaurants with no redeeming qualities and this place had a good appetizer and I really enjoyed my entrÃ©e. However, if they want to compete in this area they really need to step it up. I certainly won&#39;t be going back."capri-of-downers-grove-downers-grove,Brittany M.,4P4CQd2zFp1wbwedRCnWPA,"Brookfield, IL",0,1,0,11,12,j2KO_2jDUFZLAH2CbIe2xg,2,07/02/16,Everytime I have ordered from here it&#39;s amazing their bruschetta and stuffed artichoke are delicious even though I wish they had it morecapri-of-downers-grove-downers-grove,Bob S.,ff3CwyUweu_AWRaNDX1dnA,"Downers Grove, IL",0,1,0,7,5,WtzfkQ9aF-AEyf71wPwM6Q,5,11/06/16,"Been going here with my wife for years. Â Would go more if it were not for one larger issue. Â The food at Capri is five stars in my opinion, and we have always had good service once we are seated. Â I knocked the rating down to three because you cannot count on your reservations being honored on a Friday or Saturday night. Â On numerous occasions I have made reservations on a Friday or Saturday evening, but we have had to wait 45 minutes for a table to be available after we arrived at the restaurant on time. Â This is really frustrating, especially when we have hired a sitter for our kids. Â I have had other people tell me that they have had the same experience. Â I would recommend that if you want to enjoy the food, go any other night besides Friday or Saturday nights."capri-of-downers-grove-downers-grove,Joe C.,ILjjq7s5uc4dJUSr8Cr0Ng,"Chicago, IL",0,1,0,0,6,cFuqJk9Hjx8QuC7C08_XqA,3,22/05/15,I was somewhat surprised when I saw 2.5 stars for this place.

Â We had to wait almost an hour for chicken entrees. Â Won&#39;t be returning.Drove by downtown Downers Grove looking for a nice place to eat. Â My girlfriend pointed out Capri and said her Uncle had been there and said it was good, and her best friend and husband enjoyed Capri. So I decided we could give it a shot.I was clearly under-dressed and that was my fault for not being aware we were going to eat a late Italian meal.The menu looked promising. Â I ordered Pollo Francese and she orderer Pollo Limone. Â It took nearly an hour for us to get our meal. Â We watched tableS(yes plural) were being served each course of their meal before we saw our entree. Â It looked like they were serving a tables full courses before moving to the next table. Â Tables got their salads, entrees, desserts and receipts before we got our entrees. Â Luckily we did not order an appetizer. Â When we did get our meals my meal wasn&#39;t to bad, my side of pasta was over done. Â My girlfriend&#39;s was suppose to be lemony. Â There was no lemon in her sauce, excluding the slice of lemon on top of the chicken. Â The sauce was a heavy oil taste(I tasted it myself), her vegetables were very salty.When the check came the waitress did not remove the lemonade I never got, because they were out. Â So she removed it before running my card.When I got home I thought about what to write on my review. Â I then realized they charge me $3.00 more for one the entrees. Â I checked the menu online to confirm. Â I was considering calling the restaurant, but the damage was done.Our poor waitress was at the mercy of the chef(s). She got us a bread in the beginning. Â She offered to get a 2nd one but took forever to get a second bread order. Â At first I thought she was forgetful, I think the chef(s) had to bake it.I believe there was a guy who was working at the restaurant and working the bar who seemed to be a manager or owner. Â No one ever came by to check on us or how things were. Â That same guy did happen to talk several times to an older couple that was next to us because he did clearly know them. Â He never checked on anyone else.

Mind you we were at a party for 20 ppl and note that they can only split up to 5 checks...oh and they had added 20% for tip. i normally see 18%, but it was my first time seeing 20%.We were first given unlimited complimentary toasty bread that were warmed up in the oven. There were also Olive oil, cheese, roasted garlic, and olives on the table. Next, we had received our soup and appetizers. I had picked the minestrone soup. The soup was seasoned fine, but the vegetables were too overcooked. For appetizers, I had the Calamari Capri and free Bruschetta (For checking into Yelp). Calamari was cooked great, but it sat in oil that seemed to be seasoned with a slice of Lemon on top. I didn&#39;t taste any seasoning, so it was like dipping into Oil. I would of liked to have a wedge of Lemon to drizzle Lemon juice on top and marinara sauce to dip the Calamari in. This dish you wanted to eat quick, otherwise the batter on the Calamari will soak up the oil. Then, the Bruschetta is your typical toast with tomatoes and olive oil. Nothing special, but I think it was the best out of everything I had ordered. Finally, the entree I ordered was Fettucine ala Gamberi Scallopini Alfredo. The Creamy Alfredo sauce was very thick, which made it hard to pull apart the noodles, and it was a bit salty for my taste. I had to add pepper to balance out the saltiness.The Shrimp and scallops i believe were cooked okay, but the shrimp had the tails at the end. So it was inconvenient to eat the shrimp, then use your fingers to pull the tail off.Overall, the staff were nice, our water were filled, and the food was served at the right time. I personally won&#39;t be coming here for Italian food.Oh I can&#39;t forget to mention the incident of a staff member photo bombing the birthday girl blowing out the Candles.

Â A little over a half hour later, we showed up asking for our table. Â The hostesses told us it Â would be an hour wait. Â Excuse me? Â I explained that we were told a table would be ready for us when we arrived, but they stated they didn&#39;t have any record of the reservation (insinuating we were lying), and that we would be required to wait an hour.Frustrated, we left the building. Â However, we really wanted to try this place and had already driven there and found parking (no easy task on a weekend), so I decided to give the restaurant a call and ask to speak to the manager. Â When I did so, the hostess refused to let me speak to him, because he &#34;was busy with customers.&#34; Â I insisted, stating I&#39;d be happy to hold, and eventually was connected. Â I explained the situation to the manager (who had actually taken our reservation initially), and he apologized and kindly offered to remedy the situation, inviting us to come back for an immediate seating. Â I was grateful he took action quickly, and fixed the situation, hence the 3-star rating.The manager followed through on his promise, and we ended up having a great meal, though our server was painfully slow. Â It took a lifetime to get our bread basket, and each course after that.On a positive note, I ordered the vodka rigatoni, and it was some of the best I&#39;d ever had. Â The homemade pasta is to die for, and truly makes a difference. Â We also got the chocolate molten cake, which was a perfect ending to our meal - not too sweet, yet wonderfully decadent.I was a little annoyed that they brought out bottled coke products, rather than fountain drinks. Â This isn&#39;t very Eco-friendly, and you don&#39;t get free refills. Â I think the server should have mentioned this when we ordered. Â Also, the garden salad was severely lacking - basically just lettuce with a few pieces of tomato and cucumber. Â Plus, they didn&#39;t offer ranch dressing.I would come back, but I will definitely plan for a non-busy time - like maybe 3:00 pm on a Tuesday. Â I wouldn&#39;t step foot in the joint on a weekend, because I&#39;m almost positive I wouldn&#39;t get seated even with a reservation."capri-of-downers-grove-downers-grove,mei s.,9IlFyfehRiD7rR5F9nqTjg,"La Grange Park, IL",1,1,0,47,17,VBas3zZmLR8_-EOGa-bO5Q,3,24/05/14,"We went on a night where apparently they were short staffed.

When she finally came over after the first flagging, she didn&#39;t even acknowledged how she had been gone for 20 minutes after they had taken away our appetizer and how we still had not ordered our dinner yet. Â I was peeved. Â Then after the second time, she did acknowledge her inattentiveness and was overly effusive in trying to compensate for it. In any case, the service was poor from her but the hostess was nice and helpful and explained that they were short staffed that night.Despite this, the food was good. We started with some calamari, the spicy one that is Â flash fried. Â They have three versions of calamari on the appetizer menu, two are fried. Â This was delicious. Then we ordered a garbage salad and a caprese salad. Both were ok, I&#39;ve had better. Â The main entrees of eggplant parmigiana and seafood risotto were excellent. The risotto was like buttery.

Then...we waited for one hour for our entrees. We had to ask how much longer. We were told that the kitchen was backed up. However, this not being our first restaurant rodeo, we noticed that people were coming in after us, ordering, getting served, eating and leaving. We observed a table with two adults and a child who were seated outside having to also wait for their food. Our waitress, who also seemed to be on bartender duty, was pleasant but not efficient or very on top of her game. The food arrived extraordinarily hot. We wondered if it had been sitting then needed to be zapped. It was good, so there are no complaints there. The waitress came over and asked us how everything was, we said fine, and my cousin asked for red pepper flakes. They never came. We asked another passing by waitress who brought them over.

It was a special so you would think they would have made the ravioli but it was heated from frozen (all of the ravioli was perfectly square and uniform) and had a very odd sweet sauce on top of the ravioli being 2 colors (black and orange).We ordered Jumbo shells with marinara. The sauce was good and the noodles were okay but the stuffing was not good at all. Usually I would expect ricotta cheese but this was something else. You shouldn&#39;t mess with a good thing.Finally I ordered the filet wrapped with pancetta.

It&#39;s not a cheap meal by any means. For something so expensive, I would expect the meal to actually be made there instead of being just heated from frozen... I&#39;m pretty sure the steak was heated from frozen too.

Â Perhaps it was that I ordered a bad choice, or it was just an off night for them. Maybe it was also due to the fact that I had just come back from a trip to France, and after eating in Paris for a week, anything eaten in the West Burbs was going to fall hopelessly flat. Â But whatever the reason, I found the food here absolutely atrocious, and certainly not worth the $$. Â Which is surprising, as while I certainly enjoy fine cuisine, I am not a food snob by any means.

With that said, we had a poor dining experience this past Friday Night. Yes I know its crowded, I made reservations, we were celebrating my husbands birthday. Just the two of us, but I called two weeks ahead of time, and the day of to confirm our reservations, and ask if it was OK that a cake be delivered. They were so accommodating. This is where it ended. We got to Capri, there were seats available, but the hosted said they were waiting for our table and to have a seat a the bar, we did had a drink, and were still waiting. Finally after about 30 min later I asked if our table was ready, she said yes and sat us. I had a feeling she forgot about us and if I never said anything I may still be at the bar. After we sat we waited another 15 min for water and another 10 minutes after that for menus, finally our waitress came. I wouldn&#39;t normally mind the wait, it was supposed to be a relaxing evening. However we noticed a table that was seated after us in front of us, received all the staff attention the whole night, we practically have to beg for someone to come and take our order. So we ordered and waited again, for our Brucutto to come out, and of course the people next to us go their very quickly. We continued to wait, finally got our order and it was OK, we were starving by the time our food came. After dinner my husband wanted to get the check, but I knew I had a special cake delivered. So I went to the bathroom, and on the way back talked to the waitress. She was so pleased, and excited, she say the cake it looked great, after another long wait we got our cake. The staff was so excited and greeted us, finally we got our waitress and managers attention, a little too late in my books. Now, I didn&#39;t go in there wanted a lavish dinner or be so over-ally attended to, however to see another guest being hand over foot the entire night and not until I brought this to your attention the third time do you act. Not good in my book.

Food is subpar -- tastes like the low-quality food at a shopping mall food court. WIth a food court ambience to match.This was my first experience at Joy Yee Noodle. Based on other Yelp reviews, I was looking forward to some great noodle dishes at a restaurant. Instead, what you get is a food court or college cafeteria experience. Lots of cheap white tables and cheap white chairs crowded into a small area. It looks sloppy and lazy because the tables are crooked (not in a nice line), and they are all unevenly tilted in different directions. There is no artwork, no color, no decorations, nothing appealing. They set the tables with glasses still wet from the dishwasher and a pile of utensils rolled up in paper napkins, which makes it hard to differentiate the clean tables from the dirty tables. All the dirty dishes are piled high in tubs on carts throughout the dining room, which is not something I want to see during my meal. And it was very loud.The over-sized menu is ridiculous, having more than a 100 Pan-Asian entrees, appetizers, soups and sides... possibly nearing 200 menu items. The vast array of items is a huge clue that the food is mediocre. A good restaurant will &#39;Keep It Simple&#39; and offer a few items which are done well. A bad restaurant offers a complicated menu that lacks focus, and it is reflected in poor quality food.To make things worse, I ordered the Japchae Lunch Special with a Strawberry Lemonade. I should have known better than to order a Korean dish in a Chinese restaurant. It tasted completely Chinese--was very heavy with oil and soy sauce--nothing like Korean japchae. I ate about a third to half of the dish and gave up, I seriously couldn&#39;t swallow the food anymore. The egg roll that comes with the meal was very crispy and not too oily. The taste was different than what I am used to--not good, not bad.The Strawberry Lemonade definitely missed the mark. It was a puree of strawberries and water. There was no lemonade tartness at all. Definitely over-priced at $3.95!After they bring your food to the table, no one ever comes back to check up on you, which I am fine with. I wasn&#39;t sure if I should wait at the table for my bill, or go to the front counter. The lady sitting next to me decided to go to the front counter to pay, and a server scolded her and told her to go back to her table and wait for the bill. After seeing that, I stayed at my table and waited for the bill, which took about 10 minutes because the employees don&#39;t seem to monitor the dining area very well.I wasn&#39;t impressed. I don&#39;t know what all the hype is about. I can see it&#39;s appeal for a quick lunchtime meal or take-out, but I wouldn&#39;t recommend it to my family or friends."joy-yee-noodle-naperville-2,William X.,QIsCPeIobaAHVGQqJzPI8g,"Elgin, IL",0,1,1,140,110,OIHwOqFhZsF3Us99z9gtnw,2,01/09/16,"Let me be clear, I LOVE Joy Yee: bubble tea, pan-Asian food, big portions, cheap prices, and delicious.

I asked for a new glass of water and was brought one with fairly minimal griping. Problem solved, right? No. The new glass of water had EVEN MORE stuff floating around.

Gigantic portions of food, a dizzying selection of bubble teas and other delicious cold drinks. I&#39;ve tried a variety of dishes and drinks over the years, and usually just order my usuals now. There was one dish in particular I did not like (fried chicken lemon grass or something like it - very dry, too salty), but everything else I have absolutely loved. Soup portions are huge. Fried rice comes in a mountain. Veggies are always fresh and never wilted. Most of the time, your meat dishes come with a very generous amount of meat. Food comes out quickly. Almost every time I come to eat here or pick up my take-out, the place is hopping full of people. They&#39;ve got quite a following. Makes me feel bad for the other Asian mom and pop restaurants that are relatively empty, but man their food is good.Docked one star for the service and recent price increase of the drinks. Definitely one of the places you go to for the food, not the service. However, my husband has developed quite a good rapport with one of the gentlemen there (probably because at one point last winter, we were there at least once a week) - he appears to have some kind of managerial/owner role, and he&#39;s always been great to us!

The design of this location is very contemporary and minimalistic. Most patrons seem to enjoy sitting towards the back on the elevated bench. Maybe it&#39;s because you can swing your legs and can keep an eye on the entire restaurant while you eat.We sat at a regular table. Tables are still close to one another, but it&#39;s much better than before the renovation. The smoothie bar is much larger and towards the front of the restaurant. The entrance has also expanded, which allows you to not hover over someone else and drool into their food while you wait for a table.I ordered my typical jackfruit avocado smoothie (with tapioca), the shrimp spring rolls, and I tried something new: the Korean spicy pork on a hot plate. The food came out quick enough and was very tasty, as always. The pork had just enough spice to it and was sizzling pretty much the entire time I ate. If you don&#39;t like hot peppers in your food, don&#39;t order this or ask them to make it mild.The only thing that&#39;s changed about this place is the interior-same decent service, same delicious food, same Joy Yees vibe.

For the longest time I never noticed this Joy Yee (even though I&#39;m at HMART all the time) and always went to the one in Chinatown Square or University Village. Honestly, I only go here for the smoothies. The food at Joy Yee is fine if you&#39;re a quantity over quality kind of person, but the fruit smoothies are really really good. My favorites are the jackfruit, durian, or avocado freeze with tapioca and crystal jelly, but any smoothie you get here is pretty solid.Food wise, the menu is huge so you&#39;re bound to find something you like, but it&#39;s also Pan Asian. I feel like the thing with a lot of Pan Asian places is that they don&#39;t do any one particular kind of food well since the menus are always several pages long. This is no exception. Everything I&#39;ve tried here is pretty mediocre. Like not great, but I&#39;d probably eat it again if the opportunity was there. Portions are huge, but lackluster.

Hubs: &#34;Oh, they have mapo tofu.&#34; The 90s came screaming back to me. Hanging out in his apt with me in ugly Umbro shorts, eating/gagging on the Mapo Tofu he made me. Oh, please NO!I ordered my food and he ordered mapo tofu with his polite &#34;Please feel free to eat as much mapo tofu as you want.&#34; Yeah right.I kept eyeing his while I slurped my soup. The mapo tofu didn&#39;t smell like his. --It smelled better. I caved and inched my spoon forward. Suffice it to say, I loved it so much, Joy Yee became a bi-monthly rotation ever since. Â Lots of flavor depth and huge pieces of tofu and ground pork. It sounds vegetarian but this is definitely not.I&#39;m not entirely sure if this is your place for Crab Rangoon or Sweet &amp; Sour Chicken. But this is your place if you&#39;re ordering dishes such as Baked Rice with Chicken &amp; Salted Fish (not on the menu but yelper Karen D suggested it. Delicious), my family&#39;s favorite Mapo Tofu, Korean Beef Kimchi over Stone bowl rice, or their Korean Kimchi Beef Fried Rice....because trust me, Â Kimchi should be eaten on everything!Their new restaurant is a vast improvement even if their closing was nearly the death of me. Much more space and much easier to come in and order take-out. It used to feel like quite the crush with even 3 people waiting. -No space to even stand. There&#39;s no explaining why it took so freaking long to reopen, but all is forgiven now that I can eat my kimchi again.My tongue watered just typing this."joy-yee-noodle-naperville-2,Lb L.,pMTf8SltAd7r7w8dBiM7Tw,"Naperville, IL",0,1,0,0,7,ExYxqgYD31F2vNrACor3Sw,4,27/10/16,"I used to love the Egg Roll Vermicelli at Joy Yee but they have changed the sauce. It is much darker and sweeter and I didn&#39;t like it all. Plus, I was amazed at how much they have changed the portion sizes. They filled the bottom of the bowl with big leaves of lettuce and then put the food on top. What looked like a big bowl of food was really only half a bowl. They have also increased the spicy heat of the Sweet and Sour soup. I didn&#39;t mind it but someone who doesn&#39;t like spicy food would have found it way too spicy."joy-yee-noodle-naperville-2,Steve H.,q1iQrhCFPaDnwmfsxFeXpg,"Bourbonnais, IL",0,1,1,77,571,4QIxL4CXqDgEcXYDDPPtQw,3.5,17/08/16,"A place I frequent a lot with friends and family.

I saw this Joy Yee location wasn&#39;t far away so we went over.Their lunch specials were good and well priced. I think it was $8 for a pad Thai the kids inhaled. It came with a soup and an egg roll. I got a Korean noodle soup and it was ok, not the best thing I&#39;ve ever eaten but not bad. Next time I&#39;d do a lunch special.The bubble teas were a disappointment. I got an almond milk tea and it tasted watered down. There just wasn&#39;t enough flavor in it. The bubble teas at the Chinatown location are always good so this was a letdown.The service was good.

The decor is updated and really pretty. When I commented on the change the young woman who was the cashier was unimpressed by my noticing. She wasn&#39;t too friendly. So I ordered pad Thai with beef, chicken with string beans, and two drinks with tapioca. Both drinks arrived without straws and little customer service. I had the food bag and two drinks with no offer to open the door orProvide a drink holder until I struggled to leave and the man who opened the door noticed and asked about the straws.

I didn&#39;t give them 5 stars because I ordered Spicy orange chicken and Spicy basil beef, both are delicious but not spicy! The beef teriyaki baked rice was so savory, this is our favorite and I highly recommend it. When the restaurant closed and we saw it in Facebook that it was permanent we were crushed.

Unfortunately, they don&#39;t have the right type of chili or chili sauce for the pho. When I asked for some, they brought gochujang. The broth in the pho is not very flavorful, and they don&#39;t include any of the necessary bean sprouts, thai basil, thai chilis, or lime wedges for you to add at your leisure. The dish we got, a poor szechuan impersonation, was underseasoned, but had too much sugar, too much starch in the sauce, and had almost no heat. In addition, some of the seats are incredibly uncomfortable, especially the bench style seating next to the walls.In conclusion, if you want lackluster Asian food in a desert of Asian food, come here.

But I was kind of disappointed when the young man and I ordered some carryout this week.First of all, I ordered taro bubble tea. It&#39;s on their menu, and I see other people&#39;s pics of it here on Yelp so I know they make it! What they gave me neither looked nor tasted like taro: it tasted like chocolate milk with a dash of coffee. (May I add that taro milk tea is lavender-colored and this was light brown.) I didn&#39;t go to pick it up and my bf didn&#39;t know the difference, but someone clearly fucked up, either knowingly or not.My pineapple chicken-shrimp fried rice was pretty pallid. Aside from the meats and pineapple...that was it. No veg or anything else. What? The meats were well cooked, not tough or anything, but something is missing here...The dude got short ribs and thus won the jackpot. These were sliced thin and coated with a sweet-rich glaze of some sort. YUMMM.We also got crab rangoon which was pretty good; at least something other than cream cheese was discernible inside.Overall, though, I know Joy Yee can do better than this.

I&#39;ve always been a fan! There&#39;s a reason why there are 5 different Joy Yee&#39;s locations all across the Chicago land area. It&#39;s because they&#39;re doing something--EVERYTHING RIGHT.JY is known for its pan asian food, good prices, fast service, yada-yada-yada. Everyone knows this. If you don&#39;t and you&#39;re reading this, I would first like to congratulate you for finally stepping out of your comfort zone from under your rock haha!So why am I writing this review if everything about JY is fairly obvious and well known? I&#39;m glad you asked. All the other reviews will give you paragraphs upon paragraphs of their food and service so I&#39;ll focus on something else here.I&#39;ll focus on the ONLY THING THAT&#39;LL EVER BE WORTH MENTIONING.Their. Bubble. Tea. (Or &#34;Boba&#34;, depending on where you&#39;re from in the USA).For those that have never heard of Boba/Bubble tea. Allow me to give you a brief crash course. Boba/Bubble Tea refers to chewy, tasteless, deep purple tapioca balls the diameter of a chickpea, nestled at the bottom of a fruit smoothie, or tea based drink. The flavors ARE ENDLESS. For example you could do something familiar and tame, such as a Strawberry Boba which would be nothing more than a freshly blended strawberry smoothie with a generous layer of tapioca balls at the bottom. Or maybe you don&#39;t like strawberries. Maybe you like mango, kiwi, blueberry, peach, pomegranate, avocado, raspberries, cantaloupe, watermelon, honeydew, bananas. Maybe you can&#39;t decide and you want kiwi AND mango together. They&#39;ll do it! One of my all time favorites is kiwi-strawberry-raspberry blended together. You can&#39;t go wrong!But what if you want to try new things? Maybe you have epicurean taste buds. JY&#39;s got you there too! Papaya, passion fruit, coconut, almond tea, jackfruit, durian, lychee, green bean, red bean, taro, durian and more! Today I personally got Taro Boba, and I cried tears of happiness, and heard angel sing. In the past I also got a blend of almond milk tea AND coconut tapioca, and was never disappointed with any of my choices. My suggestion? Be creative! You can&#39;t go wrong!UNLIKE other places that do Boba I ALWAYS come back to JY because they are the ONLY place in all of Illinois that I have ever encountered that make boba with FRESH FRUITS, and not from a powder or some weird reconstituted fake fruit paste. If you come here for boba during mango season, you will walk in the restaurant and IT&#39;LL SMELL LIKE MANGOES. This is a blessing an a curse. Blessing because everything is always delicious. But a curse because you will never be able to have boba from anywhere else EVER AGAIN.For those who aren&#39;t a fan of tapioca balls, I should mention they have other options to &#34;spice up&#34; your drink. They do fruit jellys (kind of like chopped up jello pieces-- BUT WAY BETTER) that are different fruit flavors, and different sizes of tapioca as well.Service: Again, this a full running restaurant, but at any given time there&#39;s a consistent, steady flow of customers JUST getting Boba to go. Service is always quick and even when there are 7 people in front of you (like when I was there today, a Thursday at like 5 PM), you&#39;re still out of there within 6 minutes.TL;DR: If you&#39;re a fan of asian food go Joy Yee&#39;s. Good prices, great service, really quick moving. Lots of other reviews will talk about food. I always go for boba only! Best Boba in all of Chicago land is at any JY location. They&#39;re the only ones to use FRESH ingredients and not canned/pureed/fake/powdered ingredients. Wide spectrum of common ingredients (berries, bananas, pineapples, etc) and exotic ingredients (red bean, taro, durian, jackfruit, etc)."joy-yee-noodle-naperville-2,Mansoor A.,eFCWQavDnQ4k7518jRqqug,"Chicago, IL",0,1,0,0,24,K68IdtKmiJ3P98EsVJDCpg,5,07/07/16,They close at 9:00 but doors are locked at 8:45.

It is amazing how well flavored their boba tea is especially with the tapioca and how robust the food dishes are. No problem ordering carryout orders.The main thing that brought my review down to a three star review is the service. I had come in to sit down with my friend for the first time here and we had to wait at least 5 minutes before someone can take care of us. This was also on a Thursday afternoon where only five other tables were in the restaurant other than us and they were standing around doing nothing. They didn&#39;t seem to be very interactive and friendly either. Also, when we were given our check, we felt rushed because he was standing there staring us down waiting for the bill and he even tried taking the bill when I was still putting my part of the bill in cash. He then also stood there waiting for us to put our tip on the table and right when we put our tips down he took it from our table and left. I honestly felt like we were rushed and not welcome to stay for such a long time. Otherwise, no complaints about the food whatsoever. It was super delicious!!I would recommend this place if you were to do carryouts and just stop by to pick up some beverage.

Despite being super busy, the staff was very attentive and patient with us. One of my friends had a few questions regarding some dishes and the waiter happily answered all of her questions and made some very helpful suggestions.We all ordered a variety of dishes such as Bibimbop, pineapple chicken fried rice, teriyaki chicken over rice, Korean BBQ short ribs, and Vietnamese Egg Roll Vermicelli Noodles. Everyone enjoyed their food and we had to take most of our food home because the portions were pretty big. No complaints though because you get what you pay for. Since Joy Yee is a pan-asian restaurant, I didn&#39;t expect every dish to be super authentic but I wasn&#39;t too disappointed in the dishes that we ordered.After we stuffed our faces, we decided to end our meal with some boba milk tea. I got the red bean coffee tapioca and even though it may seem like a strange combo, trust me, it&#39;s good!

From food quality, to the inconsistent orders I have received.My personal beef was with Jennifer today. The &#34;delivery manager&#34; which some days they decide that they will deliver to oakbrook where I work, and sometimes not. I also work customer service, and they obviously don&#39;t have any here.It took 30 minutes longer then they told me over the phone because they got our address wrong. I originally called to order 3 orders of Korean bbq short ribs, and when the gentleman took my order, he stated that but he only delivered one and charged me for one. I called back and said I wanted to order and pay for the second 2 but I didn&#39;t think they should charge me for the second delivery, being that it wasn&#39;t my fault and they charge 8.50$ from naperville to oakbrook. She said &#34;you have to pay if we send someone else out&#34; I told her I didn&#39;t want it and that it was fucking ridiculous.Fast forward 5 hours. My coworker called to ask if they do delivery for 3 smoothies without knowing my experience earlier, and she said &#34;nope, we don&#39;t deliver to that address&#34;. her attitude is just so unprofessional but then again, it is a fast food pan Asian restaurant, where the customer is never right.Calling in and talking to her or the real Manger isn&#39;t worth the frustration, but I felt like the yelp world would be able to get a laugh out of my frustration.

Â I had been waiting...and waiting...and waiting for this day to come for a L-O-N-G time! Â Finally Joy Yee reopened and we were able to come in for a nice meal. Â Thank goodness they decided to paint away the florescent yellow green walls--the decor is modern and chic without having to go overboard with the crazy minimalistic vibes of fluorescent paint. Â Yuck! Â But really, I&#39;m Chinese and used to the whole concept of good food in typical hole-in-the-walls and so for years I just ignored it. Â No more Joy Yee, you have definitely taken a big step up with the roomier dining area and nice ambiance.The food is just what I remember---always a step above good! Â Yum. Yum. Yummy! Â Although we usually don&#39;t go for lunch we decided to stop in since it was our first opportunity to stop in. Â We started out with the Lychee Tapioca &amp; Taro Tapioca drinks. Â Score---just as good as I remember! Â The Spring Rolls were very good although they were made with shrimp only, no additional pork added in as in the traditional Vietnamese way they are generally made. Â Okay so no pork but that&#39;s okay they were still delicious. Â Finally, the Salt &amp; Pepper Shrimp and the String Bean Salty Fish were AMAZING!!!! Â They really impressed with these two dishes!So my takeaway is that Joy Yee hit a home run once again. Â I am sure that they will be crazy busy again once everyone knows that they have re-opened. Â My only concern is that they did raise the prices a bit and that&#39;s why the 4 stars instead of 5. Â The lunch as listed above was $49.49 without tip for 2 people. Â Yes we did take a bit home for leftovers and we did order shrimp. Â The portions were big but wow we just thought a bit high-priced for lunch (no special lunch menu on the weekend)."joy-yee-noodle-naperville-2,Hankyung C.,bLL-99AXY8y9j_0T2yIWdA,"Downers Grove, IL",1,1,1,38,8,WKd9dWZ1Qs_2mTygwBRIwA,4,30/09/15,"This review is purely based on the coconut milk bubble tea with boba.

It came in a huge bamboo bowl. The only thing I do not like is the display of menu (this is why I am only rating 4 stars), which separates the pictures with prices.

They loved the food. They loved it to the points that they ordered carry out for their spouses, who also loved it. However, from my point of view, the serving sizes did look a bit smaller. In addition, they also had no ice water? Just&#34;cold&#34; tap water. What also is good to note is that two of the parties sitting next to us got up and left in the middle of their meals due to the extremely slow service they received. What really sets an Asian restaurant apart from an American restaurant is the fact that if you argue with an employee about the service being slow or the food being wrong, the employees will argue/yell back.

My go-to favorites are often the red bean, taro, milk teas, and anything with some mango, but seriously, all the drinks are awesome and have always been the main attraction for me here."joy-yee-noodle-naperville-2,Steven L.,p9L8jTwbADRfSs2IR0LWoQ,"Naperville, IL",0,1,0,6,5,-7bIbu2P_xrzD42RW4Ku6A,5,29/01/16,Poor service.

Came on a Friday night and while the wait staff had good intentions, service was incredibly slow, unresponsive, and inefficient. They forgot a drink order and then again, two entree orders. It took over an hour to receive all orders after multiple attempts at getting the attention of the wait staff. And it took another 15 minutes to wave anyone down to get the bill. Â 1 of the 6 entrees we ordered (beef with tomato rice) was the same as before and really good. The pho dac biet had almost no meat, no noodles, and just tons of broth. The same with the egg noodle seafood dish. It&#39;s like they started skimping on portions though they were will served in the gigantic bowls. It was all together a disappointing family dinner and with the exception of the rice dish, we probably won&#39;t be back for a long time."joy-yee-noodle-naperville-2,Tom D.,86OzDXFzLW4PYEGlWjbk5A,"Lisle, IL",0,1,1,0,57,6ydYhiW-rwXGCOoiihQs2w,2,18/09/15,Love the food!

Highly recommend it, the majority of the meal was absolutely fantastic.The charcuterie board consisted of Point Reyes blue cheese, Hand dipped ricotta with local honey, Anabasque, House made Pork &amp;Truffle terrine, Italian proscuitto di parma aged 600 days, and Mild Spanish chorizo. It&#39;s served with cinnamon raisin and sourdough toast points, pear puree, housemade stone ground mustard, and dill pickles. I&#39;m a huge fan of adult lunchables ( Oh yeah, you know that&#39;s what that is :D), and these were amazing. The combinations were fantastic, and individually they were great on their own. My personal favorites were the blue cheese and the pork and truffle terrine. I would go back just for the charcuterie.The sumac lamb chop starter comes with sumac spice, quinoa cake, mint and orange gremolata, cipollini onions, and a cucumber creme. Both of us loved it, all of the elements really went well together and the lamb chops were perfectly cooked.The wedge salad was ok, but the salad dressing is so strong it overpowers everything else. It&#39;s really spicy and peppery, you don&#39;t really get any blue cheese from it. We asked the waitress about it and she said that they add their house made mustard to it. If you dig spicy then go for it, but I would recommend not adding pepper to it, i&#39;m glad we skipped out on that. We dig spicy so we were fine, but there&#39;s no mention on the menu of it being spicy, so if you&#39;re sensitive to spicy and peppery go with another salad, or maybe ask for the dressing on the side or sub with a different dressing?For dinner I had the grilled Ahi Tuna. It comes with israeli couscous with scallions and basil, and roasted farm tomato eggplant. First off, that israeli couscous was awesome. I would divorce my husband and marry that couscous. Freaking loved it. The tuna was ok, but the couscous and eggplant were my favorite parts, they were so good.The man had the flat iron steak, it comes with chimichurri, calabrese potatoes, watercress, pickled onion, and parmesan fondue. The steak was perfectly cooked, and he loved it.Dessert we went with churros, they come with chocolate ganache and strawberry creme. The churros were perfectly cooked, they were so good.Now onto BOOZE!!!We did not have any of the wine, so I cannot attest to their wine selection. They have beer on tap from local breweries, including the session sour from Penrose brewery which I absolutely love. It can be hard to find a sour at restaurants sometimes.The man had a whiskey sour, which he was a fan of, even though the egg white threw him off at first. I had a perfectly made dirty martini with blue cheese olives. Is there anything better than vodka and blue cheese olives? Yes, the israeli couscous from here. That&#39;s it, there&#39;s nothing else. I also had the cucumber cocktail. It&#39;s presented with basil and mint leaves, and looks really pretty. I highly recommend ripping those leaves up and muddling them in the drink, it really helps bring out those flavors. Really refreshing drink for a hot summer night.TL;DR Overall we absolutely loved this place and plan on going back. The salad dressing for the wedge salad was really peppery, and the tuna was just ok, but everything else was awesome."the-finery-and-blacksmith-bar-st-charles,Maggie W.,QpUzX-gYa34qkBwi5FWivg,"Port Washington, WI",0,1,0,49,4,ASWh5pGE7CNOzvqf50WiWw,4,20/07/16,"It lives up to the hype.

It is a signature dish and it was wonderful. In my youth I hunted with my Dad and pheasant was always our favorite. The breast was on a bed of risotto and truffles.

In fact we all agreed that the Caesar was the best we&#39;ve ever had. The wine special was a pleasant Barbera.There were lots of other specials but we stuck with the menu, beef cheek and flat iron steak. The beef cheek was fork tender and very tasty.

I did enjoy the spinach salad, although for $11 is was a bit small. However, the real problem was the length of time it took to receive or order. I think it must have gotten lost in the kitchen. People that came in long after us were served first. They did give us a free desert to make up for it, but I think they probably should have given us a free entree. Luckily, we weren&#39;t in a hurry to get anywhere. The other issue was I found the noise level high. They were playing some kind of a thumping base. Since we had to wait so long for our food, this constant thumping was getting very annoying. Also, it&#39;s right next to a gas station, and the headlights from the cars would occasionally shine in my eyes. The waitress was very nice.

We decided to come about a month after opening last year and the food was absolutely amazing. With the servicers being wonderful and knowledgeable of the food, and the food being to die for, we decided to have our rehearsal dinner for our wedding here.David, the owner, worked with us on giving food recommendations, putting a menu together, and also was just someone who genuinely cared about the experience we were having. It was nice to see an owner of a restaurant doing whatever they could to make their customers experience the best it could be, and David did that for sure!We had nearly 75 people and rented out the restaurant area for our rehearsal. They brought in a very well designed curtain to separate the bar area from the dining area which looked really nice and gave us the privacy which is nice to have with a private event. I know I previously mentioned this, but the servers that you get at this place are truly amazing. They educate you on the food you are eating and know the food that is being served. If that isn&#39;t good enough, they also see when a glass is getting empty and bring over another glass of wine!The food we had for our event was the country pheasant, flat iron steak, and the salmon. All three are fantastic options and I would recommend any of the three. The cheese and Charcuterie plate as an appetizer as well is a must every time we come here moving forward. We have now tried almost every appetizer and a majority of the main courses and have yet to have a meal we both haven&#39;t loved!I can&#39;t say enough about this place and the experiences we have had here over the past year.

The Finery is definitely a new location, so they are working out a few kinks- but how they handled all minor issues is the reason I am still going with 5 stars. I have no doubt that they will be fully 5 stars with no issues in the future. Let&#39;s start with the great- the food. Everything I&#39;ve tasted here has been excellent. The last time I went I was with a group of 9 people- and we all got different entrees (impressive I know)- and everyone loved their dishes. Several of us had leftovers, but not all. My husband enjoyed his pheasant, I loved my potato pancakes, and I loved the beef stroganoff when I ate their before. Everyone that had a meat free dish was raving about their food- so this might be a great spot for vegetarians!Here are our minor issues and how they were handled:One tap of beer not working on our first visit- free beer for the person who ordered it.Reservation changed from 7-9 but they did not get the updated reservation. We had to wait a bit for the table- but they happily moved us and the owner came over to specifically chat with us.Our service was excellent on both occasions- and I love the atmosphere and how everyone wants to go here right now!

We could have just ordered one dessert and split it. The coffee was just ordinary and we both commented it tasted like &#34;wedding&#34; coffee or something out of a big party 30 cup coffee pot. We expected a deeper taste rather than watered down.We will be back for the fall menu as we enjoyed but learned some lessons for next time.Give it a try.

Third the drinks wonderful and they have a decent wine list.Now getting to the food itself, some of the meals are outstanding and some are just lacking something. Our party loved the pheasant, the bread and the deserts. Unfortunate we had some huge let downs with the beef tenderloin and the beef stroganoff. Our dinning partners agreed that the stroganoff was off this evening. The dish tasted bland and was very unappealing. After reading such rave reviews about this dish and our dinning partners insisting it was usually better than this, the beef stroganoff was a huge let down. Our waitress brought out a replacement meal without a problem and without really asking which meal we would like as a replacement. While this was nice we were then charged with the replacement that we didn&#39;t even choose. From such a fine establishment we would have never expected to be charged for a very expensive replacement meal that we didn&#39;t order.We ended the meal with the apple torte, which was amazing!!! This place should seriously look at selling their deserts at a bakery outpost because they are amazing.Overall the pheasant and the deserts are amazing, and some other dishes seem to be hit or miss.

Â Good to have a new place in town. Â I hope it succeeds, but the chef must start to taste his food before it leaves the kitchen.Fried Artichoke Hearts - little to taste other than the crust - zero spices.Wedge Salad - good portion; blue cheese dressing would be a better choice for the wedge, not Kraft ranch dressing; added egg is a great choice.Bread - decent variety for 2 bucks.Salmon - this is where help is needed; the dill sauce added very little to the taste; the salmon was not fresh; not spiced and not cooked to perfection; should flake; garnishes were not correct choices.Flat Iron Steak - very good; someone knows how to prepare steak; garnish good, but potatoes so bland.Maybe would return - Shakou is better. Â Good drink choices, but don&#39;t charge me extra for cubes on a rocks pour. Â Servers need to learn the difference between bourbon and whiskey.These guys deserve to make it.

Again not over kill but just enough attention to make you feel like they were happy you were there and that they wanted to make sure you were happy too.Started with the Pheasant Pate that was excellent. I had the American bouillabaisse with perfectly cooked shrimp, prawn, mussels, white fish and scallops. My husband had the pheasant, which they are known for. After just one taste, without any black truffles, it was clear why! Both dishes were excellent, well prepared and served.Dessert was the special banana bread pudding and almond pound cake.

Thanks to using my Yelp app, I found this gem of a place. The Finery is a fairly new place in St Charles opening last July. Â The restaurant has a small bar area with a few tables immediately when you walk in. The dining area isn&#39;t a large space, maybe 20-25 tables, and aesthetically pleasing with dark brown wood floors and tables, black chairs, exposed brick walls and high ceilings. The staff is extremely nice, especially our server Morgan. She was very knowledgeable about the menu, made great suggestions and was pleasant and friendly. Morgan provided great service. The gentleman who seated us and is the person who would work with you to pair wines with the food was very sweet as well. Â My husband and I started with the charcuterie board consisting of blue cheese, ricotta and honey, goat cheddar, lamb terrine, prosciutto and goose salumi served with grilled sourdough and cinnamon toast, homemade plum jam, grainy mustard and pickles. It was fabulous! Â We also ordered the bread with two butters, which consisted of four small rolls in different varieties with a caramel apple butter and a spicy mango butter. My husband ordered the cod for dinner, which was cooked to perfection with a crispy sear, moist and flaky and served on top of cauliflower purÃ©e. I had a half dozen oysters, which were very fresh served with salmon roe and cucumber ice, along with the grilled Caesar salad. The salad consisted of two halves of romaine hearts with homemade croutons, Parmesan, olive oil, anchovy and a poached egg. It was to me a deconstructed upscale Caesar salad. The husband and wife chefs are amazing and their food creations not only beautiful to look at, but full of flavor. Â We ended our meal with the churros with strawberry and chocolate ganache dipping sauces. I enjoyed this neighborhood gem and will definitely be back to explore more of the menu.

We had to wait about 20 minutes at the bar, where they didn&#39;t have enough servers, and the bartender ignored us. After 10-15 minutes one in our party finally made eye contact and Â got a bartender to let us order a drink.At least after that the service improved! Our waiter was very helpful and no problems there.We were asked if we wanted bread, we did, and were told there was a charge... The charge was very small I think $2.00. We got a plate of 4 different small rolls and on the side, what looked like a teaspoon or less of two different butters for 4 people. Geez.. Â It did have a nice presentation, but if your charging for bread and butter, at least provide enough butter for the rolls.There was 4 of us for dinner, and our meals ranged from fair to excellent. I had the beef stroganoff.. and I have to agree with Laura. H&#39;s review.. I love a good beef stroganoff, and this was this was not it.. it was very bland, I couldn&#39;t detect any sour cream in the sauce.. It was very fair. Another dining partner ordered the special for the night which was home made pierogi&#39;s. These were an expensive disappointment, It was like 28$ for 6-7 pierogi&#39;s. Now the guys chose better, one had the flat iron steak, which we did all try, it was cooked perfectly and excellent. My husband had the salmon which he thought was very good, but with it came brussel spouts that were burnt.Despite the expensive pierogis, the bill for the 4 of us with drinks was reasonable.There are so many options out there, but we might give this a 2nd try."the-finery-and-blacksmith-bar-st-charles,Bizz N.,UDHLGF1-_ZmrE3X_O1zL-A,"St Charles, IL",0,1,0,0,1,jtYKKJnKKQTNhKx_opO6uA,3,05/09/15,"Went there on a whim with the wife.

Even though I believe it&#39;s their 4th day open, everything seemed to run smoothly. It did take a while to get out drinks(most likely still working out the kinks) but they were well worth it. I had a cucumber cocktail from their menu. It was amazing. No detail was forgotten, it even had what seemed to be a homemade cucumber ice cube in it. Our group had the following dishes, peach caprese salad, charcuterie platter, artesian bread, flat iron steak, pheasant, stroganoff, salmon and trout. For dessert, we had all of the desserts on the menu.. Chocolate fondant, panna cotta, cake, and beignets. Everyone was very happy with their dishes. The risotto that the pheasant rested on was super creamy and delicious. The steak was cooked perfectly and the chimichurri was the best I&#39;ve had. The trout and salmon were too notch and cooked just right. The stroganoff was the best I&#39;ve ever tasted. The flavors exploded in the sauce. Every bite was a joy. I was surprised to see romanesco on the plate with the salmon. What a great pairing! That&#39;s a vegetable that you don&#39;t usually see. The peach caprese was also something I had never seen before and it was delicious. Even the butter that came with the bread was custom. I believe it was infused with some sort of red pepper.

The pork? Absolutely a wonderful addition and the egg was perfect.The beet and mozzarella app was good, some pepper helped. The sauce and candied nuts added that zing of flavor.

Most disappointing...NOTHING came with it. Not even syrup. No bacon or sausage or nothing. And no syrup!The most disappointing thing was the bottomless mimosas. 18$. Heck no.

There were 6 of us and we all very much enjoyed the food and atmosphere. However, the Bloody Mary&#39;s were so bad we sent them back twice and eventually switched to Mimosa. The mix they used was awful. Further, one of us drank iced tea and the waiter took the glass to get a refill and 10 minutes later had to ask to get it back.Despite the beverage issues the service was pretty good. Â I&#39;d recommend it for the food (Tortilla-egg Stack, Finery Breakfast, Sausage-polenta), which was ALL fresh and quite tasty."the-finery-and-blacksmith-bar-st-charles,Adam K.,dOfKoFIEEEDoTQjAf2viig,"South Elgin, IL",0,1,0,0,31,oDpNskx6Oliqijfa0cMA4w,4,01/05/16,"Ok, went here last evening with the wife and I must say, it was AWESOME. They have a very unique cocktail list that will surely invite you in. Â  They come out with a nice palate cleanser before they begin. Â We enjoyed the mushroom and goat cheese and the wedge salad, both tasted amazing, the salad had a wonderful dressing that ascended into your nasal pasages like a slight hint of horseradish, fresh bacon bits, and boiled egg wedges. Â They also had a mushroom cream soup on special that was on point as well. Â For dinner I had the pheasant on the truffle risotto, mind blowing stuff here. Â The wife had the scallops and they had a nice sear on them. Â The service was really good to. The cadence of the dinner was good. Â We went really early without a reservation, it got busy fast.

On our first visit, the food was very good but the service needed definite work.Decided to give it another try and there were several noticeable changes, all for the better. We were warmly greeted at the host stand by a hostess and then the affable Mario took over and saw us to our table and repeatedly checked in with us throughout our meal. He was beyond friendly and made sure we were happy with everything. He is a great addition - he was seen chatting with each table and could also be seen consulting with and directing other staff and servers.Started with bread service with homemade butter - well worth the $2 charge - excellent variety and very tasty. Also shared a smoked acorn squash with goat cheese and arugula which was very unique and a great start.We enjoyed an excellent whiskey sour and margarita from their imaginative cocktail list and will have to work our way through the rest of the list.Next, our entrees arrived and were phenomenal - braised beef cheeks with spatzle. The beef was tender and deeply flavorful and the red wine and beef reduction was beyond good. The spatzle was the best I&#39;ve ever had, as it was crispy but still toothsome. The mini pickled turnips were a wonderful citrus foil to the rich beef and sauce. The other entree was a special and consisted of a braised beef loin served atop velvety polenta - another home run.Our server hit the right balance between being attentive and giving us time and space to enjoy our meal. Again, the service has undergone a transformation and turned this visit into a wonderful experience instead of just a good meal. The chef visited tables, including ours, several times to check on our experience and food. He is clearly passionate about pleasing people and is an extremely talented chef. As is his wife, who we did not meet but was apparently responsible for our sublime spatzle.We shared a brownie for dessert, which was no ordinary brownie. It was topped with an orange cream and had pools of delicious raspberry sauce. The brownie had a crunchy base and was a very well-conceived dish.No peaks and valleys in the food or service - everything was spot-on. Fantastic visit and we were already plotting our next visit halfway through the meal!

Mario answered the phone - and invited us to come in. As a quick note, Mario is fantastic. Incredible service and passion to make sure we had a great evening. It&#39;s hard to overstate the value that he provided to our dinner adventure.We were able to get a table immediately, as the restaurant was approximately half filled at the time. Interesting note, they had put together a table seating perhaps 14 people or more, so this place can handle good sized parties.Anyways, we were seated a little ways from other guests which was nice as it allowed us to have a nice conversation. I feel that the restaurant handles sound well as when I stood up to leave I hadn&#39;t noticed it was completely full (on a Thursday night).The waitress was great and on top of taking care of us. We had the cheese platter (delicious), I had a nice steak and my Dad who had joined me for dinner had the Salmon. The food was all very well done. The cheese and meat platter I highly recommend - you won&#39;t be disappointed in this. The steak and salmon were both perfectly cooked and had a nice bed of sauce that went along with each dish nicely.I could go on about this place - but just go there and enjoy it instead.

Light as a feather. delicate flavors. Oh, I didn&#39;t like to share it...........Second: Just as good; this time the place was rocking. Yet the service was still attentive, courses were well timed, and the salmon was delicious. well prepared. Nice visual presentation, too. I think the owner/partner/GM was there, mixing mingling and getting involved. This is a great thing to see. It shows there&#39;s support for this place top-down.

However I feel I must comment a recent experience.We dined on a weekday night and although the food was mostly up to its usual level, three of us ordered Cod and they were extremely salty,and the food came out unusually slow. Our waiter accidentally lost control of a glass of red wine which splashed all over my husband, me, into my purse in the floor and onto my phone, I felt so sorry for him and Â I don&#39;t blame the waiter because he was new and did everything he could to make the situation better. Who I blame is the chef/owner who continued to sit at the back of the room, working on his laptop and talking to friends! We were practically the only table there and there&#39;s no way he didn&#39;t see what happened. Yet, he sat there and did nothing to help his staff or us. The waiter offered to pay our dry cleaning. We decided not to expect that of him because he tried to make our evening enjoyable. What should have happened is that Â the chef should have come to the table and gave at least my husbands and my entrees for free. We had a table of 10 for goodness sakes.

One of the best meals I&#39;ve had in a while and that&#39;s saying quite a lot as I was in New Orleans last weekend eating at restaurants staffed by chefs from Top Chef on Bravo TV. The attention to detail was fantastic. From the beginning as we entered the restaurant and we were warmly welcomed, to the service and the tastiest food. We all started with something scrumptious. I had salmon poke inside of fried wonton sheets. They looked like 3 beautiful cornucopia. My husband had the beef barley soup, not a drop left in the bowl for me to try. He loved it that much. Our friends had fried artichokes with arugula and west coast oysters. Lots of smiles around the table. Then came dinner. Two of us had black ink pasta with shrimp and spring vegetables, one had pheasant and one had lamb shank with these amazing pickled onions over spetzel. I typically don&#39;t post reviews but I just needed to share. Honestly, I couldn&#39;t believe I was in St. Charles, IL. This was a meal that I would have expected in a downtown Chicago restaurant.

My friend and I came in this past Wed evening to celebrate her birthday. When we walked it, the air was on full blast and it was freezing! (my friend had to get a sweater from her car). We were greeted a minutes later by our server who was pleasant. We we looking over the wine menu, when the the server suggested that we try a tasting of the cabernet we were contemplating on ordering. We said &#34;sure&#34;, but then a few minutes later she came back and asked if we were ready to order our drinks. I guess she forget to bring us our tastings. We proceeded to order the wine anyway and it was delicious!I ordered the flank steak, medium. I asked for just a little pink...no blood. My friend ordered fish. When my steak came out, it was raw in the middle and my friend&#39;s fish was cold. We waited at least 15 minutes before the server finally came to check on us. During that time, we saw what looked like a tasty burger go by. We were curious as we never saw that they had burgers on the menu. When the server finally came by, my friend asked about changing her order since the cold fish grossed her out and wanted to know about the burger. They did in fact have a grass-fed burger that night as a special. We never knew about it because she failed to mention it at the beginning when she greeted us. It was disappointing that they didn&#39;t do anything for birthdays...even offer a free dessert with a candle.A short time afterwards, my steak returned prepared to my liking and it was very good. My friend enjoyed her burger/fries. The manager came over, apologized and bought us our wine. That was a nice gesture, but unfortunately with everything that had happened... it still put a damper on the first experience.I was also a little disappointed in the ambiance. It was the same layout as the previous restaurant. Sure, there are some cool light fixtures and wall paper but I thought they could have changed up the space a little and maybe had some fun music playing. The atmosphere that night was quiet and boring. I may try this place again, bring my husband and sit in the bar area (which is very small).

Â It is a limited menu, with Â about Â one entree for each of pork, beef, poultry, and fish.Very reasonable wine prices, especially by the bottle. Â By the glass selections were well conceived and not the normal grocery store brands.Service was good considering the restaurant was full.My only complaint was the dessert we ordered - the brownie with gelato - it was minuscule and the brownie wasn&#39;t rich - it was pretty bland.

Luckily, I live in an area that is definitely not devoid of taco establishments. I decided to try La Lomita out because of the other reviews I had read. The restaurant itself is small, but clean. The prices are more than reasonable. I noticed that the restaurant&#39;s name would be changing to &#34;Johnny&#39;s tacos&#34; soon, but so far it looked like the menu was exactly the same.I ordered two steak tacos and two pork tacos for carryout to share. The tacos were made fresh of course, so it was a bit of a wait. First of all, I was surprised at how much meat were in the tacos-very satisfying. The meat was seasoned deliciously on the steak and the pork tacos. The red and green sauces that the tacos came with were also very flavorful with the right amount of kick to them.I would definitely come back here and get some quick tacos to go. So far, out of my rankings during my taco explorations, this place is in the number one spot. My stomach is still exploring though, so maybe there&#39;s still a place out there that can beat them. So far, I haven&#39;t found that place."jonnys-tacos-bolingbrook,Nate S.,w9XTME7ocEzRH65TUePyYg,"Houston, TX",0,1,0,56,8,MBqmuINMHHlqNZVZqI9gjA,5,15/08/16,Just great.

The meats are all well seasoned, and the vegetables are fresh- you can really make out all of the ingredients and spices.

It was, and we were off to the races. Chicken tacos are also priced the same if you&#39;d prefer to be fowl mouthed.The al pastor tacos were the stars of the show, though the chicken was pretty good too. I would like to try their tostadas and gorditas too.I&#39;ve seen some complaints about the service here. Granted, I came after the lunch rush, and the place had just a few dining in, but our server was very attentive and professional. Sorry that others have had bad experiences - this is just another data point.As others have noticed, they are not spending their revenue on fancy furniture and fixtures.

We had them on both flour and corn tortillas. I also had a steak taco and a steak gordita. The steak left a little bit to be desired.

I took one bit of pastor which was pretty good just a bit too sweet for me. I am pretty happy with my none-breaded fish taco which was the kind I like. Chile relleno was a small pepper for the taco tortilla which tasted great but no enough cheese stuffed in. The best one was beef cheek which was all lean meat and super tasty.The service was a bit on the slow side which didn&#39;t bother us.

Otherwise, I would have wondered what the heck happened to this restaurant&#39;s wall and decor.The service was stellar. Our server was really nice, took time to explain some dishes on their menu and was quick to bring everything.We ordered Chicken Fajitas, three Carne Asada (steak) tacos, Jarritos grapefruit soda and Pico de Gallo. The chicken and steak were okay and just wasn&#39;t seasoned or salted enough to make the dish flavorful. What made my tacos decent enough though was adding the green salsa dip and pico de gallo. The downside was that almost half of my first taco had fatty steak pieces. I like that they don&#39;t skimp on the ingredients and as a result, my tacos were huge. The dishes came with complimentary tortilla chips and three types of salsa dips (mild, medium and hot). The chips, grapefruit soda and pico de gallo were excellent. Just a warning though, the jalapeno peppers in the pico de gallo are HOT. After a couple of small bites, I had to down almost half my soda and blow my nose. I would recommend ordering it and asking them to put just a little bit of jalapeno peppers.They have a $10Restaurant.comcertificate available, so you can use that if plan on ordering at least $15 worth of food.I can&#39;t fully say I&#39;d recommend this restaurant yet.

I went to this place tonight because I had been there before and although things weren&#39;t perfect, I decided to give them another try. My first review was on 4.14.2015. After that visit, I went and purchased morerestaurant.comgift cards. Today makes the 3rd time I went there but .... I WILL NEVER BE GOING BACK.This is how the night went. Let me back up first. At the end of April, I went to this place and the food was good. The only issue I had was the waitress. She completely screwed up the order. I had to send it back, not once, but twice. In the end, it still wasn&#39;t right but I said forget it. Keep in mind, I ate the food, paid for the food and even left a tip. Again, things weren&#39;t perfect but I still wanted to come back. Hey, everyone has bad days.Well tonight I was there and ooooh boy. What a sour taste I have in my mouth. It started off okay. He informed me of the drink special as I couldn&#39;t decide what I wanted. I went with the margarita for $7. Most of the time waitress/waiter will ask if you want salt, sugar or nothing. He didn&#39;t ask me and I didn&#39;t think about it as I rushed to the ladies room. When I came back and saw my drink, I noticed it had salt. I don&#39;t put salt on any of my drinks. I flagged the waiter down and said I need a new glass with no salt. Okay, this was taken care of. cool.We place our food order. The waiter didn&#39;t write anything down but that&#39;s okay because at some places, they rely on their memory. However, in this case, memory failed him. My order was not correct, AGAIN. I asked him to fix it and he kept saying something about another taco. Me and m party was confused. I repeated what I wanted, AGAIN. He took my food back and not even 1 minute later, had another dish for me. Hmmm, i should have known it would go down hill from there.We ordered the taco dinner. On one of the dinners, the steak had A LOT of fatty parts which we set aside as we tried to eat. Then there was a very hard piece of meat that we couldn&#39;t tell what it was, so we set it aside again. She tried to continue to eat but found something else wrong. It was a burnt piece of something that we couldn&#39;t figure out. So needless to say, the meal was ruined, appetite lost with all the mystery and fatty parts.When the waiter came back to the table, we mentioned that we wanted to speak with a manager because this meal was not satisfactory. We even showed him our concerns or complaints. He said, sure, no problem, we will take care of it. We said, just charge us for what we ate, which was one taco, beans and rice. We weren&#39;t asking for the entire meal to be taken off, just the part we couldn&#39;t eat anymore. The manager, Arturo, if that&#39;s his real name, came to the table and asked what issue we had with the food. We begin to explain and show him the complaint. Now.. as a customer, it baffled me and offended me when he said &#34; I was here before when you had a complaint about the meat&#34;. Ummm I never had a complaint about the meat the last time. The complaint from the previous visit was the waitress screwing up the entire order. So excuse me.. what are you insinuating. HOW RUDE!!!!!! At that point, I was ready to use some choice words because of his accusatory tone and words. I quit talking and let my partner finish. Im not a person to just let things slide when we are being wronged. Yes I was HIGHLY offended by his accusations. He then went on to say that, the hard Â brown part was cheese. Soooo you served me burnt cheese?? Â Arturo, the manager, stated, &#34;We only have one grill.&#34; So you mean to tell me that you don&#39;t even clean your grill properly in between orders?? 1.. how is that our problem and I even asked him that. He said that is not our problem. 2.. what about people who have food allergies? So you are cooking seafood, pork, beef and chicken etc on the same grill and you JUST admitted, basically, that you don&#39;t clean your grill properly otherwise I wouldn&#39;t have had left over burnt cheese that should have been scraped from the grill. !I finally had enough with this guy and this place so I said, just bring me the bill. Why was I charged for 2 margaritas?? I only had one. So I said something about that. He was pissed and said, dont pay for anything. Wow.. cool.. I stormed out."los-arcos-mexican-and-grill-woodridge,Tristan R.,CH5rw9K_lwUL6jUEQWMoMA,"Willowbrook, IL",0,1,1,0,4,tsT5wCWoo4y-I0f3hWdHdQ,1,21/03/16,Place is pretty good been here twice.

I was short on time so I told them it was okay.Today Arturo (I think he is the manager) remembered what had happened(2 weeks after the other order) and made sure I wasn&#39;t charged for my order today. I went back to my office and to my surprise a few minutes later, the receptionist told me someone was here with my &#34;order&#34;.

I would definitely suggest an improvement in customer service!My food was ready quickly since I called in it, but I waited almost an additional 10 minutes as they rang up other customers, or fixed what I asssumed to be a glitch in the system, and guess what? I had absolutely no problem waiting. My problem came when I asked about an additional sauce and received no answer as if I hadn&#39;t asked the question. Ok, sometimes I speak a little softly, so I asked the young lady did she hear me? She looks at me and says &#34;yes&#34; oohokay Sooo, why didn&#39;t you acknowledge me? So I ask again, she says she gonna charge me. I reiterated to her that I just spent $40 on food, I&#39;m asking for 1 additional sauce. I&#39;m fine with a no,my issue is the additude that came with the no. It was uncalled for. Also, my sister called in the order, Â and had a drink. I had to ask them for the drink. If I handt asked Im doubtful I would have received it.In the end she gave me the sauce, but reiterated that it was just this time.After that service believe me.....there won&#39;t be a next time!

I recommend the cilantro because it goes good with the lime they give you. They do not need any salsa or hot sauce on them. I use to work with a guy from Mexico and he said that his mom use to make corn tortillas early in the morning and they would put butter on them and eat them throughout the day for snacks because they were so good.

The food is flavorful and delicious. I seriously cannot get enough of their chile relleno tacos. I took one bite, and I was immediately smitten. It is so good, it&#39;s the only thing I ever end up ordering from there. I&#39;m sure many of their other items are fantastic but I can&#39;t seem to get enough of their chile relleno tacos. Go try them! ANYWAYS...let&#39;s talk about service. Service has always seemed to be an issue, in pretty much every single instance we have picked up from there. Everytime we do pick up, our food is never ready by the time we get there to pick it up. I&#39;d get there to pick up the food, and every single time I was asked to take a seat and wait at least 15 minutes for them to cook the food. Doesn&#39;t that defeat the purpose of pickup?...Furthermore, delivery seems to be slow. I live 5 minutes away from Los Arcos. We ordered delivery online one night and the confirmation email stated our food would be delivered by 6:30. Our food did not arrive until 7:15. We were a little irritated by it, since we were so frickin hungry. But all was forgiven after we ate our food lol. I had my chile relleno tacos and my boyfriend had a steak burrito dinner.Overall, would I recommend going to Los Arcos? Sure. At least in terms of food. They have an extensive menu. There&#39;s something for everyone. If you don&#39;t like one thing, there&#39;s many other things you can try. But to be honest, if it weren&#39;t for those damn chile relleno tacos I&#39;m clearly obsessed with, I don&#39;t think I would keep coming back since service does not seem to be a strong point of theirs..."los-arcos-mexican-and-grill-woodridge,Ashley H.,-6EYzp2Ok-QzG5hHl5cK1g,"Woodridge, IL",0,1,0,24,6,u4GuY82gz8xH2bfiq7YJDA,3,03/10/15,"This is officially my favorite spot that&#39;s close to home. Â Everything about this place is awesome! Â I&#39;m REALLY picky about mexican food and this place has the best authentic mexican food I&#39;ve had outside of the city. Â Not only do they have delicious food ( I&#39;ve tried multiple dishes, all so yummy) but their drinks are AMAZING &amp; HUGE! My girlfriends and I stopped in on a Saturday night for a few drinks and to our surprise they dimmed the lights and had a dj and disco ball! Â That just made it so much better. Â We had a blast! Last night ( Friday) my husband and I went on a double date here and again we had so much fun. This time they had karaoke. We didn&#39;t participate but it was fun to watch. This place is not fancy, Â but I like that because it&#39;s comfortable and relaxed. The best part.... the prices! I&#39;m talking, way low prices for way good food and drinks AND they are really generous with their liquor. The drinks are pretty strong. There is an adorable bald man( maybe the owner or manager) who is so incredibly nice. He goes out of his way to make sure you are happy &amp; makes the BEST sangria I ever had in my life. That is not an exaggeration. So, after 2 Sangrias and 2 Mango Margaritas rimmed with chili powder... I am writing this review the next morning because I seriously cannot wait to go back. Â Maybe today just for some hangover food haha. Â Oh, and I also have to add in here that we have ordered here for delivery and the food tastes just as good at home as it does at the restaurant. So on nights where we just feel like staying in... this will still be our go to spot. We are so glad we found this place. We will definitely be back again &amp; again!"los-arcos-mexican-and-grill-woodridge,Paulette K.,2lSZz7RXbVvpxbDd5puNmA,"Chicago, IL",0,1,0,0,9,F6be3T7qUvQicmZluzdoOg,5,09/08/15,"Went there on a Sunday for lunch on a recommendation from a friend.

Â If you blink you might miss Los Arcos (it&#39;s located behind the Mobil on 75th and Woodward. Â Overall opinion: exceptional food, OK service, but kind of a poor space for a restaurant.Let me start with the food, which I would actually give 5 stars. Â To start, they have a full bar and a really nice selection of tequilas. Â The waitress was pretty familiar with all the tequila, and had several recommendations. Â After drinks we decided to start with chips and gaucamole. Â Gauc comes in 2 sizes- small and large. Â The small is enormous, there must be 2 or 3 avocados in the small. Â It&#39;s not made tableside, but it&#39;s incredibly fresh. Â Only knock was that there was a little too much cilantro. Â Otherwise it was outstanding. Â Chips are also served with a trio of salsas (mild, medium, and hot). Â All were excellent.For dinner I had their special skirt steak with chorizo and cheese (Arrachera Los Arcos), and my girlfriend had the chicken taco salad. Â The skirt steak was outstanding. Â I asked for it cooked medium, and it came out perfectly. Â It&#39;s smothered in chorizo (very spicy) and cojito cheese. Â It&#39;s served with rice and beans, and tortillas. Â This was an excellent dish. Â My girlfriend loved her taco salad- what stood out to her was that the chicken and beans were in the bottom of the bowl, while the lettuce and tomato were on top, keeping it from getting soggy. Â Overall, the salad was really good too.Biggest drawback to the place is that there&#39;s no ambiance. Â It&#39;s a big room, and you can see out through the windows. Â We were here on a Saturday night and it was freezing out. Â Every time the door opened, we got hit with a blast of cold air. Â Fortunately I found out they do delivery in addition to carry-out, so you&#39;re in luck if you don&#39;t want to eat here. Â Overall pretty happy, I&#39;d come back to eat when it&#39;s warmer out, or I&#39;d get it delivered."los-arcos-mexican-and-grill-woodridge,William A.,DBnd-h-diNa176QJclzdCA,"New Lenox, IL",0,1,0,23,14,AigjRLbC73k0WDR63oIVyg,4,14/03/14,"I eat lunch at Los Arcos two to three times a week. Â It&#39;s close to my work.I&#39;ve eaten Mexican food many places across the country, from Texas to Southern California and even in Mexico itself. Â Los Arcos has some of the best steak tacos and carne asada I&#39;ve ever had! Â Anything else I&#39;ve ever had there has been excellent, too, but I almost always default to the steak tacos or carne asada. Â Other dishes of note: char-broiled chicken, chorizo tacos. Â A lot of people like their Al Pastor and fish tacos, too, but they&#39;re not my favorite.Their chips are usually nice and fresh, and their salsa verde is fantastic! Â The guacamole is pretty good, too!The staff is very friendly (Sharon, Carmen, Annuncio). Â The service is a bit slow at times, especially if it&#39;s in the middle of the lunch rush, but the quality of the food more than makes up for that.My one very minor complaint is that sometimes we have to wait a long time for chips and salsa. Â I feel like that should be something that they bring to the table when they bring the menus. Â Also, sometimes I have to wait a while for my water--bad news when I&#39;m chowing down on the chips and salsa!All this talk of food! Â I&#39;m starving now!

Â We were going for lunch so groupon was a no go. Â The menus was confusing. Â Lunch combos did not include the pictured tacos.I thought the food was decent once we got passed the confusing menu. Â I ended up with the combo taco and my wife had the steak tacos (the name escapes me). Â We couldn&#39;t get enough of the curly fries with my combo (replacement for beans and rice). Â Once again the shells were not home made. Â Good would have much better and I would definitely rate it higher if it had more than the store brand flour shells, which were double stacked because they fall apart so easily.I will make a trek back to Chicago soon to antique taco. Â They make their own shells. Â It makes a huge difference! Â To sum it up, I like this place but would suggest that they start making their own shells. Â I would frequent this place more often once this happens. Â Also would suggest making the menu more straight forward so to attract and retain more customers so they don&#39;t feel like it&#39;s bait and trap. Â If you want the tacos pictured than you have to order 3 or 4 of the same taco. Ada first time customer I would have like to try different tacos pictured and not have to order 7 tacos to try a fish and a steak taco. Â Just a suggestion.

I&#39;m always on the hunt for good Mexican food and am tired of fighting with Pepe&#39;s about whether they&#39;ll honor my coupons (they once told me I couldn&#39;t use one because it was marked &#34;Not valid on major holidays&#34; and it happened to be SWEETEST DAY. COME ON).We ventured to Los Arcos on a frigid Wednesday night. Based on how well the online menu was designed, I was expecting the place to be a little more upscale, but no biggie. Some of the best food I&#39;ve had has come from run-down strip-mall joints.Since we had $20 to spend, we ordered the nachos appetizer, chile relleno plate and two tacos (chile relleno for my Â husband and pastor for me based on Yelp recommendations). The nachos arrived quickly and were delicious. I could almost hear the chips sighing under the weight of all the toppings. Since my husband is a vegetarian, the waitress offered to substitute avocados for meat on the nachos, even though that wasn&#39;t listed as a choice on the menu. We really appreciated that. We topped the nachos with the homemade hot sauces that were brought to our table. I love hot things, and the homemade red hot sauce had my scalp prickling - yowza!Next up were our tacos and the chile relleno. The pastor taco was delicious and the pork was just slightly crunchy - thanks for the recommendation, Yelpers! My husband scarfed down his chile relleno taco also, so that must have been good (he didn&#39;t offer me a bite because he was too busy wolfing it down). We were full by the time we got to the chile relleno plate, so we took most of it home. The few bites I managed to eat were tasty, though. My only gripe is that the rice on our platter seemed to have been sitting around for quite a while as it was quite clumpy.Los Arcos is nothing fancy, but the food is solid and we&#39;ll definitely be back!"los-arcos-mexican-and-grill-woodridge,Christopher B.,mBXqpXTyBi0Kml_20wj-gg,"Darien, IL",0,1,0,2,16,LEsOG6rphE92kk1OxMfLdw,4,22/12/13,Tlos-arcos-mexican-and-grill-woodridge,Augie O.,y4vzPpEdwvejgmbNNBuaWA,"Lemont, IL",0,1,0,0,23,TmfbUrw3ffueObXlQSKOuw,4,27/07/15,"Watch your bill.

Â Today we had the veal medallion special and the pork chops (with bell peppers). Â The veal amounted to veal picatta. Â It was very good. Â When we ordered the pork chops we asked for &#34;no pink&#34;. Â The two largish boneless chops were cooked perfectly. Â No pink but still some moisture. Â That&#39;s hard to do.

Â With the bread, salad and sides of pasta we were too stuffed for dessert.Note to the owners: A double espresso should only be about 2 oz. of liquid.I saw one Yelp reviewer that said something like if you want better Italian you would have to go to Naperville or Chicago. Â As a L.O.N.G time resident of the Naperville area, I can tell you that LDV Plainfield is better than any Italian you will find in Naperville.

From the tacky Italian American ambiance, to the inexperienced staff, and ending with food that one may say is just edible. I have every right to express my feelings in this manner due to the fact, that I am 100% percent Italian on both sides, My father from Palermo, Sicily, and my mother&#39;s side a mix of Northern and Southern Italy (Roma e Puglia) raised speaking, reading, writing the language, knowing the culture from North to South Of Italy, understanding the importance of my culture and it&#39;s authentic cuisine, not to be confused with &#34;Italian American&#34; which should be non-existent.I recently moved to the Chicago-Plainfield area from the Bronx, NYC (Little Italy). Â In hopes to find food close to home, I started to explore my local restaurants, naturally beginning with my own cultural.To make this less lengthy- let&#39;s just get into the food. To start with the menu, which was all in Italian made me believe I might of found a hidden gem. Until I stumbled upon a few spelling and grammatical errors in the wording of the menu. This lead me to believe the person who created the menu must of not been Italian and/or used Google translate incorrectly(insulted). Pizza was no better than buying a frozen RedBarron pizza to pass it off as &#34;flatbread&#34;. Calamari way over cooked and mushy, the ravioli were watery, overcooked and metallic tasting (this happens when product isn&#39;t fresh and frozen, store bought). Now the bruschetta, one of the staple delicacies to any true italian, a perfect mix of everything secret to us, tomatoes, basil, garlic, bread, olive oil. I always ask myself &#34;how can you mess up such a delicate yet simple dish!&#34; well folks the answers is simple, they messed it up. The bruschetta was so cold you might as well of used the tomatoes as ice cubes, continuing with the tomatoes which were the wrong kind of tomatoes used(again probably due to lack of knowledge of true authentic Italian food), even my wife who isn&#39;t Italian quickly pointed out that the bruschetta was not authentic before I could even utter a word.Needless to say I wont mention much more, you get my drift. If your looking for an edible meal and its a short shot of a drive for you, go ahead and see for yourself, God bless you.

THe room was of average size and tables spaced Â in a fashion where you did not get a crowded in feeling yet the restaurant was packed to the gills, bar area included. Menu choices were varied and price point apropos. Other than chicken items or pasta items the other entrees were in the low to mid 20.00 dollar range. On the website and menu they state that all food is cooked to order and be prepared for a little wait once food is ordered because of that. We did wait longer than normal but nothing that is an issue, especially when the food that comes out of that kitchen is so fresh and tasty. Even the house salad was over the top good and that is a basic garden salad. THey had at least three choices of veal on the menu which is something not typical in a suburban restaurant..THE personnel are very knowledgeable and they are vigilant in their duties Â  all the busboys were constantly refilling water glasses Â  removing dirty plates Â  replacing Â utensils etc. Dinnerware and glassware was sparking clean. Our waitress was very helpful without being intrusive and catered to our every needs Â  Â also commenting on what is especially good on the menu. One of her recommendations that we took was the tiramisu. She stated it is made daily in house and that it was very good Â  So I ordered it and it was the very best Â tiramisu that I have ever Â had in my life Â  a very very fresh tasty rendition of that Italian classic desert.SO why only 4 stars and not 5 you ask? Â  Â Well we had reservations for 5pm Â  a party of 9 and my wife and I arrived at 445.

Have been there 3 times in 2 years. The first time was not the same quality as Lemont, then went with a large group from work this past February and it was great. The 3rd time was last night for our anniversary and it was not good. We always get the strip steak with pasta and salad. We order medium rare in which it was only in the middle and overcooked on the ends and the sauce tasted bitter. Salad was good! But for $83 we didn&#39;t go there for a salad. So it&#39;s a hit or miss. Sorry La Dolce but you are not living up to Â your reputation you had in Lemont. Our server was excellent so we left her a good tip because it wasn&#39;t her fault, shes not the owner or cook.

We have a wide range of tastes in food - and there was something for everyone. The menu had a great variety of items, from traditional to a bit more creative, and each one looked and tasted good. The polenta appetizer was delicious. My 8-year-old niece - who is somewhat finicky - ate almost every bit of her food. LDV does have a Kid&#39;s Menu, and the hostess asked us if we needed one.My mother made reservations beforehand - which I recommend. The restaurant is relatively small, so there were only a couple of tables left. We appreciated the fact that they informed us that the table was near the kitchen - which didn&#39;t bother us. The restaurant is located in a strip mall, and the awnings do make it look a bit like an Applebees. Inside, however, it is decorated nicely and features photos of Italian cultural icons. As someone new to this area, I would be likely to bring a date here.The service was also impressive. Our server knew the menu and was very attentive. She never let our drinks go empty without asking if we needed refills. At the end of the meal, she and a food runner wrapped up our extra food without complaint. Everyone had enough left for lunch or dinner the next day.For a restaurant of this quality, the price was right. For a huge bowl of pasta, my dish cost $16. This included a tasty house salad - served to the table - and fresh bread. We did not drink any alcohol, but the wine list looked to be a good one.If your plan ahead and make reservations, this is a great choice!NOTE: This is strictly a DINNER restaurant, as they usually open at 4 p.m. Check the hours on the website."la-dolce-vita-plainfield,Jon T.,N3dDLuHQzdGWygSVFpRfxA,"Shorewood, IL",0,1,0,0,5,Zty5B7hKayVpXSbQ9q2Qcw,4,21/07/15,"Have been here 5-6 times, and not a bad meal yet."la-dolce-vita-plainfield,Sherry K.,tV7IpGi5UHCwrNYy5wzNhQ,"Bolingbrook, IL",0,1,0,0,159,ST0XxZk5K-HlH9xPlScMyw,5,15/07/15,Best little Italian secret in Plainfield!!!!

Unfortunately, that was not the case. When we first walked in, the place was extremely noisy, it was almost like being in a loud bar. The appetizer was not very tasty, in fact it was kind of burnt. When we received the main entrÃ©e, it was very bland, and somewhat watery. We had to ask our server on two different occasions to refill our drinks, and when one of the busboy came along to take our dirty plates, he placed the dirty plates he had already from other tables on to the plate on our table before he took it away. Quite frankly, I don&#39;t enjoy looking at leftover food from other people&#39;s plate put on my table before being taken away. On a positive note, the tiramisu was good! $85 later ($97 with tip) and we&#39;re out the door. If you&#39;re looking for a nice quiet restaurant with good food, I would advise you to go somewhere else. I only wish that somebody would have told me about this before we wasted our time at this restaurant.

My only complaint was how the food was &#34;auctioned&#34; when it was brought to the table.

I had the Salmone della Casa, and my friend had the Linguine con Frutti del Mare.

I had pre-conceived notions based on my past experience with the Francesca&#39;s in other areas, (downtown Naperville, Chicago, etc..) Â Nope. Passaggio put me in my place. Â Appetizers, entrees and desserts were very, very good. Â Service was impeccable and attentive. Â I love that. Â We never had to ask for anything. They know how to do it here.

Â All I can say is the francescas of the old days is long gone. The last 5 times I&#39;ve been here have been subpar to downright awful. It seems as though when they purchased their other brands they moved their cooks and management to those restaurants and left Francescas to rot. Â This last visit was at about 5 on a Thursday. Â Three other tables were seated. Â First issue was our drink glasses were filthy with lipstick around the rims. We asked for new ones and the waiter brought back fresh drinks in another set of dirty lipstick stained glasses. Â The third time they were brought back the glasses were clean but one of the drinks was wrong?! I ordered the calamari for an appetizer which was clearly a mix of two batches. Some were cooked perfect while others were way over cooked. Â My salmon was also over cooked. Â It was also listed to be served with avocado, but instead came with an ice cream scoop of guacamole?! My wife&#39;s pasta came missing a fresh mozzarella topping and was bland. Â Bringing it to the waiters attention was futile.

We ate at the Passaggio on a Friday evening. I see what people have said in their other reviews - the place is loud, the tables are very close together and the ambience is plain.My biggest complaint is a big one: the food. We both had the lobster bisque - if was good, but with each bite it became less impressive. The menu was a bit unimpressive - I had a difficult time picking out something appealing. I chose a ravioli of sorts that was filled with lobster and crab with a cream sauce - it was so fishy tasting! I love lobster and crab and have never experienced a fishy taste from them! My husband pitied me and we switched entrees. Â His was a shrimp and scallop pasta with a &#34;spicy marinara.&#34; The shrimp were tough (over-cooked) and the sauce had zero flavor - one step away from being canned tomatoes. He didn&#39;t care for either dish either, but wasn&#39;t as repulsed as I was.I really thought it was pretty bad and should have complained, but didn&#39;t feel comfortable doing so.

They said yes, special was still ON...10 minutes later, we arrived and guess what...?...they were out of lasagna. Total BUMMER, as this was the main reason we were going...to try the lasagna AND we even called to reconfirm. I had the rigatoni and friend had a chicken breast dish...rigatoni was very tasty, chicken dish was bland...but ordered for it&#39;s simplicity ( friend is a healthy eater so it was fine). The menu changes daily so if you like something, it may not be available the next time, so keep that in mind. I like the bread with the oil and fresh parm at the table. The room is a tad noisy and try for a booth instead of a table in the middle of the room.The lady who refilled the water and dropped off the bread was on her game and our glasses of vino and water were never empty. We appreciate that. Our server was friendly, prompt and had good suggestions on entrÃ©e selections considering they did not have enough lasagna prepared. The bonus of the evening is when our server told us Wednesday is half off bottles of wine!

However there was some shells while eating it and that was not very good. My wife ordered a caprice salad and that was good.We ordered a couple of drinks. I tried some jack Daniels drink and my wife got a mojito. My wife&#39;s mojito was disappointing. She got it here before and loved it. This time it didn&#39;t taste like it had any liquor in it and it was not very minty. My drink was too strong and all I tasted was the jack.

It tasted like I was eating saganaki. Â We weren&#39;t sure how good it would be with the lemon but it worked extremely well. My lobster pasta (can&#39;t remember what it was called) was good not great. I would not recommend it because of the price as it was nineteen dollars.The service was also excellent. They made sure our water was always full. That is always a plus in my book. She was very apologetic when my wife complained about her drink and they did take it off the bill, even though we didn&#39;t want them too. Our food and soup and salad came out at a good time. Brought us two loaves of bread which i forgot to mention were also really good.So in conclusion I might go back again but i wouldn&#39;t go anytime soon.

In some ways it looks like they shopped at Dania or a similar store. Not that this is bad but I would prefer that the inside of an Italian restaurant be more warm and comforting rather than as cold as the decor is of this place.The night we visited the menu was heavy with meats and veals- there was only one pasta dish that was truly &#34;vegetarian&#34; in nature. On the plus side, our server said that any pasta dish could be prepared gluten free (which we found out later meant omitting the pasta).Our server was attentive and helpful but it seems as if there is a severe lack of waitstaff. Even though our waitress was nice and helpful she seemed worn out and overworked- it was a &#34;worn out&#34; vibe that seemed to be everywhere you looked.As another reviewer noted- the noise level is high and conversation is difficult. My guess is that the acoustics are poor and could use some help.The meals we were served were &#34;OK&#34; but not particularly memorable or well presented. To be honest- I was very disappointed in what we were served given the personal recommendations that I had been given.I like to linger with another cocktail or a shared dessert but I was more than ready to leave after our entree plates were cleared. We actually went somewhere else nearby for our after dinner cocktail.I just don&#39;t know what to make of this place- I guess it&#39;s much like the greater Naperville area; cultivating the perception that it is more than it really is and going for snob appeal rather than substance."francescas-passaggio-naperville,Bryan T.,UQ-pbO2pSKew7wunz9sZzg,"Oak Park, IL",0,1,0,27,137,53xAPHDvFsUap4xWRbtNrQ,3,28/08/11,"Where to start?This place was a wreck. Let me first start off by saying the food was pretty good, no issues there. I had the swordfish special with the calamari fritter appetizer accompanied by a pre-meal key lime pie martini. It was a matter of service that dropped this place in star rankings.Our server was a hopped up like an out of work Friday&#39;s junkie. This was supposed to be an attempt at mocking upscale Italian. It turned into a friendly get to know you bombardment, interrupted by sporadic fragmented daily specials.We asked for bread twice. It came after the third time. I was being playful and asked if it was still being baked.This was a birthday dinner for my mother. Our service was rushed. We were brought the wrong entrees. The restaurant was only half full at 8:30pm and we were being herded like cattle to finish.Here is the kicker, the bus woman came to remove crumbs from the table during the middle of dinner. As I thought that to be rude enough, she leaned over and pinned my hand to my wine glass with her breast. Normally I would not complain, but it was awkward, ignored, and just shocking.They were playing pop music in the bathrooms, there was not one Italian server, they had Ansel Adam&#39;s portraits on the walls. Make up your mind, and hire a respectful competent staff or drop your prices to compete with the Applebee&#39;s down the road.Happy B-Day mom."francescas-passaggio-naperville,Allyson R.,YQEz5317QXuMHgHi2y_PxQ,"Naperville, IL",0,1,0,64,2324,N-6_FQdPbWGSxH1ObOdJxw,3.5,07/07/12,"I completely dogged my last review of Francesca&#39;s in Wicker Park and was determined to never visit again. A nice present of a gift card forced my hand and I&#39;m so glad that I chose the Passagio this time! What an absolutely different experience.We made reservations for 7:30 on a Saturday night. It was packed on arrival and I was told they were running behind. We sat at the bar and waited, I was already having flashbacks to my crummy previous visit and regretting the second chance. Â Shortly there after, the front of the house manager stopped by and offered us a $10 giftcard towards drinks and said that someone would be out with a complementary appetizer to tide us over while we waited. Â Hmm, I thought, this is service. Â We received an entire plate of their bruschetta to enjoy over a couple glasses of wine. Â Things were looking up!We were seated by a very apologetic staff member and taken care of by a very sweet young man who had nothing but smiles and great recommendations. Â We did another appetizer, as if the bruschetta wasn&#39;t enough, but the selections were too intriguing to pass up another. Â We both ordered something from their pasta menu - I tried the gnocchi while my dining partner had some orchicetta with sausage, veggies, and tasty cheeses. Â Their menus change periodically throughout the season. Â We were stuffed! Â The bill was hardly intimidating and in fact, I still had money left on that $50 gift card afterwards.This trip was a breath of fresh air from my previous Francesca&#39;s visit.

I enjoyed it very much and there was a really great sized portion for $13 but I have to mention that it had a really excessive amount of capers... like maybe there was a kitchen accident with the caper jar? I also had a salad before our meal and I thought the salad was very lacking in size and ingredients but it was a pre meal thing so I got over it.I got a fish dish for dinner and it was good but I thought there was a bit too much oil on the plate as a whole. Then again, I&#39;m also seeing a pattern with this at other Italian restaurants so maybe that&#39;s how everyone else likes it and I&#39;m just not accustomed. I finished all of it and left no room for dessert, unfortunately.Though I did enjoy Francesca&#39;s, I would really have liked to see a more extensive menu and maybe some more risk taking options to choose from as everything seemed very run of the mill. Also, the decor really leaves something to be desired. It&#39;s like minimal cheap diner decor or along the thought process of &#34;it&#39;s my first apartment and I know my lease is up in 8 months and I&#39;m moving out but I&#39;ll buy some frames with black and white photos already in them and hang em&#34;. I think they did just enough to get by but should really reconsider investing some time and money in an interior decorator and lighting company.

The food is equally as good at home as it is in the restaurant.Most of their pasta dishes consist of simple recipes and simple ingridients. Yet, they&#39;re delicious. They blow olive garden and the like out of the water, and the prices are only 15-20% greater. Not too shabby. App&#39;s are great, salads are ok, and soups are good. Dessert is decent too.

I was trying to have a conversation with my dining partner and she would shove her self in the way to get the crumbs off the table. She could have just waited till we left. Also the servers need to lower their voices when gossiping about costumers. I work at a restaurant myself and our staff is ten times better and the staff is well trained on our menu.

It&#39;s about 2 or 3 miles south of 75th street.Now on to the meal. My wife and I shared a caesar salad that was just the right amount for the two of us. If each person got their own salad it would be a little too much to eat before moving on to the entree. So keep that in mind.For my entree I had chicken that was covered with a red sauce (it had a fancy name that I don&#39;t remember). This wasn&#39;t your typical marinara sauce which was nice, and the presentation was very well done. I wasn&#39;t overly impressed with quality of the meal, but the uniqueness of the entrees available was rather refreshing. The selection available can be rather limiting though so make sure whomever you&#39;re going with also wants Italian because aside from the pizza options on the menu the other items are all very much pasta-centric, or (as in my case with the chicken) at least include a pasta on the side.Now if only they could get away from that handwritten menu.

The rigatoni melanzana, chicken florentine, penne alla paesana...and the desserts... torta volcano and crema alla vaniglia...wow. Delectable from start to finish.All the busboys and waiters hustled and kept checking in with us even though the dining floor was buzzing. Excellent service and delicious food. A must! especially features much more personality and original Italian taste than nearby Biaggi&#39;s."francescas-passaggio-naperville,Jennifer O.,xuekTpT3oVS9CpKcjxNgLg,"Plainfield, IL",0,1,0,14,32,N5Eao7JzmDbR6-0gOI0yrw,4,16/02/13,Wonderful service and wonderful food!francescas-passaggio-naperville,erika h.,35QdZEIPTkVmRK-PhIRPPw,"Plainfield, IL",0,1,0,0,102,3rkvKi00trxc3cIXlvWtKA,5,02/04/14,This is my favorite restaurant.

Chicken prosciutto spinach mozzarella in a light tomato sauce with a side of pasta. I get back to work only to find no spinach or pasta. I called and they told me that pasta doesn&#39;t come with it for lunch. WTF?!?!? no pasta?!?! It would have been nice knowing that before I ordered it. I paid $13.99 for 2 pieces of chicken when for dinner it would cost $14.99. The food was still good as always but I was hoping to get 2 meals out of this instead of just 1.

I know they change the menu every two weeks, which is admirable. It just wasn&#39;t all that great at the time we were there.I had the pork chops, as I was not really in the mood for a heavy pasta dish (which is rare for me), and they were fine, nothing to rave about. Â The broth they were bathing in was amazing, though! However, the herbed polenta was basically soup. Grainy, bland soup. No thanks.

There was less than a foot between my table and the surrounding guests. The restaurant quickly filled up and the noise level sky rocketed. The noise combined with the T-shirts the wait staff wore clashed with the classy decor and I&#39;m still not sure what &#34;ambiance&#34; the restaurant was going for: bar or fancy Italian restaurant?Now the food. We started out with the prosciutto which was served probably two minutes after we ordered it. The appetizer was as good as expected; the meat and the cheeses were fresh and delicious. We had barely finished the appetizer when our split plate arrived. We ordered the Rigatoni del Pastore. The pasta was barely cooked and the slices of Italian sausage were way too big and couldn&#39;t be broken up with a fork. When I managed to gnaw my way through a chewy, crunchy noodle, I got a face full of goat cheese. This dish drowned in enormous hunks of goat cheese that had no business being there. The goat cheese pasted my tongue and dominated any other possible positive flavors. What sauce I did end up tasting was bland and had a weird, goopy texture. The dessert managed to redeem the meal, however. We had the Profiteroles al Pistachio Gelato and since I hadn&#39;t really gotten my hopes up, I was pleasantly surprised. The gelato was amazing and worth the risk.Overall, I was displeased with my experience. Our waitress was excellent, that definitely needs to be mentioned. There was one woman who would not let me take more than a couple sips of my water before she refilled my glass. It got to be obnoxious. She filled my glass around 12 times, disrupting my conversation every single time. It also felt like they were trying to shove us out of the restaurant. There was no wait between any courses and the crowd forming in the bar area suggested they were only concerned with a quick turn around. I&#39;m sure Francesca&#39;s other locations are fine, but this experience left a bad taste in my mouth in addition to the goat cheese I&#39;m still trying to scrape off my tongue. Don&#39;t get your hopes up for this place, it&#39;s not worth the money or time."francescas-passaggio-naperville,J.R. L.,4ym0IdHUwCUA6-lHJ6PHAQ,"Aurora, IL",0,1,0,1,26,5W1hWWJNTEPpbQv3KYjUVQ,2,12/07/11,"since moving to Aurora over a year ago, we&#39;ve probably had Francesca&#39;s at least 10 times, counting dine-in and carry-out. The food&#39;s pretty good, but nothing spectacular. The Caesar salad here is definitely not your typical Caesar and the first time I ate it, I was taken aback. Now, I&#39;ve grown to like it, but I think they should rename it, as it&#39;s not what people expect when they order a Caesar salad.Like another reviewer said, the food is not very exciting and the variety of dishes is limited.The main reason for this review is because the last few times we got carry-out, our orders have been messed up: the Caesar salad comes with the dressing on the side in a little plastic container. Whoever packed the food forgot to include the dressing, so I basically paid about $6 or $7 for a bunch of lettuce with a few croutons. When I called to complain, all they offered was a free Caesar on a future order. So they basically just paid for my salad, but did nothing to recompenate for the aggravation. If I was the manager, I would have given 2 salads, or a free appetizer or something.On our last carry-out order, we ordered a pasta con Pollo, but received a pasta with mozzarella. I really should have checked my food before I brought it home, but....Everytime we&#39;ve ever ordered carryout, they include a some cut bread with olive oil. That&#39;s something that we look forward to, but didn&#39;t receive any on a recent order.Here&#39;s another good one: my husband and I ate in Francesca&#39;s and both ordered filets. He ordered his Medium, with Bleu cheese crumbles. I ordered mine Medium-Well, with some other sauce, possibly Bearnaise..? anyway, when the steaks arrived, there was some mixup. Matt&#39;s steak was cooked Medium-Well, and mine was cooked Medium. Normally, this would be something that I could overlook, and we would have simply switched steaks. However, they had already put the different sauces on top. We hailed the waiter, and he took them away. When they were brought back to the table, it was clear that the kitchen staff simply took the sauces off the steaks and did a little switcheroo. I received Matt&#39;s steak with the correct sauce, and he received my original steak with his correct sauce. (I knew this was so b/c we each cut into our steaks distinctly differently). I thought that was incredibly tacky, but didn&#39;t say anything. The best thing was, the manager came over to apologize. but she had the gall to say that they had re-cooked everything, when they clearly just switched the steaks. Either the kitchen lied to her, or she lied to our faces. Either way, it was incredibly disappointing. They could have at least comped our drinks, or dessert, but they offered NOTHING for their mistake.Anyway, I&#39;ve been getting very annoyed and frustrated at their lapse in service. I feel the need to inspect everthing in my bag to make sure I&#39;m getting what I ordered.We&#39;d probably just start eating elsewhere, but unfortunately there are no other decent Italian restaurants nearby."francescas-passaggio-naperville,Cat E.,YhIVADpDiEL2i6fsmMx9PQ,"Naperville, IL",0,1,0,3,143,MJFyj7Mb2ixcDv_R-un3vA,2,25/12/11,"This is our go to place - sit at the bar, bottle of wine, split an appetizer and an entree.

That news made me sad. First, I am a vegan myself, and I had eaten at Francesca&#39;s Passaggio on many occasions. I had always asked in the past whether there was any meat, dairy, or eggs in the vegan-looking pasta dishes that I ordered, and I was always told no. Now, I think that almost all of the dishes that I ate must have been vegan, because they used only wine or olive oil as a dressing, but I did have the marinara once or twice. So, there are some pasta dishes that vegans and vegetarians can order, and some of them are quite good. Look for the &#34;cold sauce&#34;, which is available in the summer months. It is delicious.I feel that I should award the restaurant one star given that some of the waitstaff didn&#39;t know that none of the pasate sauces are vegetarian (seriously, get it together).

It&#39;s trendy, has a city-esque feel to it, and there&#39;s no denying the fabulous rooftop bar and seating. From the looks of things, this place really has it all together. Me personally? I still feel like they have some things to work out.I&#39;ve been here twice now, once for lunch and once for a drink after work. We sat inside on the main level as the rooftop wasn&#39;t open during the day (too bad because it was beautiful out). The restaurant was pretty empty during the lunch hour. You would think this would help service be more attentive and on point, but it took a very long time for our group to be greeted by a server which kind of rubbed us the wrong way (bad first impression).We started with the poutine fries ($9) which were pretty good. Fried mozzarella chunks, cheddar, gravy, bacon, and sour cream all on top of french fries is a recipe for delicious. This app was a bit on the soggy side, but overall a tasty dish.I also had the BBQ brisket sandwich which had beer BBQ sauce, cheddar, and apple cabbage slaw on a pretzel bun roll ($14). I really liked this! I thought it was very flavorful. A bit overpriced, but delicious none the less.The second time I stopped by was to meet people for a drink after work and we sat up on the rooftop. It can get pretty crowded at Empire on a Friday night, so at 6:30 pm be prepared to wait for a seat upstairs. From what I can tell they offer valet parking and rumor has it there&#39;s a cover charge for late night on the weekends (no thanks).The opening of Empire was long awaited and I hope with time they will fully live up to my expectations. While you&#39;ll definitely find me on their roof top on a nice day, I can&#39;t say I&#39;m going to be a regular here any time soon.

Â  The only complain I have is that the servers do NOT have bus boys so I was so thirsty I had to waive the server to bring me water.This restaurant has a lot of potential but has to work on the customers that are eating on napkins, utensil, extra plates and serving wAter. Â One more thing the host lacks experience on the sitting arrangements because she asked us if we had our name on the list? Â  The restaurant was very much empty when we got there.

While their cool sign outside immediately caught my attention, the rooftop bar caught my friends attention - and I&#39;m glad it did!Neither of us had heard of Empire but with the sight of the rooftop bar we decided to head on up and check it out. Nobody talked to us when we walked in, while heading up, or once we got upstairs, but we found a couple of seats at the bar and snatched them up. The service at the bar was slow - I mean it was probably 15 minutes before anyone asked if we&#39;d like a drink - but we were taking a while deciding on our order anyway so it was fine. Also the girl at the bar next to us definitely should have been cut off. She fell and couldn&#39;t get up. And it was a Tuesday around 9 pm...to say the least. So that got interesting. And nobody behind the bar seemed to notice or help.Anyway - the rooftop bar was a cool place to hang out and enjoy a drink.

Walking in, I knew I would probably be a frequent visitor to this place.The inside is very spacious and there is a stage on the main floor for entertainment, a huge bar, a small first floor patio, a second floor, a second floor bar, and a second floor rooftop patio with a touted retractable roof. *takes deep breath* This place has a lot of space, and it looks like it will be well used.I was impressed with the service, with it being the first evening for outside patrons. We were checked regularly while we sat at the bar. The bartenders make pretty great mixed drinks and don&#39;t water them down, which is always a plus. They have an extensive beer tap list and I was very excited that they had a few sour beers available.As far as the food, I can&#39;t give a full review because we only tried the freshly made donuts. They were absolutely wonderful-warm and soft and dusted with delicious sugar. They gave us more than enough and I think that the serving matches the 8 dollar price just fine. I only wished for a larger serving of donut dipping sauce.For now I&#39;m giving Empire four stars, just because I haven&#39;t fully tried their food offerings.

The food is good not great its better then five guys n any other burger place in town i liked the empire tots the burger cigar the goat n the empire burger now lets talk about the bad 1 the service theirs alot of employees but it seems like theirs lack of training n some might not even be fixable. expect slow service n confusion on where the foods going because they dont know ask for everything as soon as u sit down like napkins dippin sauce or anythin u need because u either wont get it or receive it at the end of the meal. 2 they never put enough sauce on anytjin idk what their problem is if they jus are lazy or cheap but ask for extra sauce because everything needs more sauce. 3 the bugers need to be bigger n more flavorful for the price their expensive so the burger itself needs fixing 4 toast the bun plz nobody likes soggy buns 5 add more desserts plz 6 becareful the floor might be wet in some places u could easily fall 7 plz season ur fries n tatter tots plz i like my fries to actually have a taste if they fixed these issues then it would be a better restaurant i would come Back if im in the mood for burgers n dont feel like Drivin to kumas cornersEmpire tots $8: their homemade i thought they were gonna be the frozen kind. I would have liked them to be a little more Crunchier Â but they werent greasy so it wasnt so bad. The actual tot was filled with cheese so delish i dont remember seeing bacon in it. The one issue with the tot it needed seasoning really badly salt n pepper would have made this dish amaizin. It is spicy which i liked but the one thing i was missing was the sauce theirs not alot like literly theirs like a smudge if u paid me a million dollars i wouldnt be able to tell u what the sauce was so ask for more. I liked the addition of the egg for richness jus wish the egg had seasoning on it. The scallions added bite to cut through the richness all in all good jus if they fixed it this dish would be a home RunCartel burger 15$: this was the least favorite burger of the night. Its a chorizo patty i was expecting so much flavor since it has chroizo in it there was a lil kick to it but the patty was small n really bland i was expecting a very spicy flavorful patty. The guac didnt really add anythin it needed more lemon for some pop. Then theirs these corn fritters that were good a lil greasy i liked them cause they added a sweet element to the dish. Again their wasnt enough sauce so burger was a lil dry because of that i wouldnt order this again the bun needs to be toasted because it gets to soggy. The fries this timeWererent seasonedThe goat 14$ this burger was amaizin when u read the ingredients youll be like wtf doesnt sound good but it was amaizin! Make sure it has alot of honey in it or it wont taste good. Goat cheese n honey best combination ever. The creamy tart flavor of the goat cheese blended perfect with the sweet honey then theirs bacon in there for saltyness like ur tongue will have the best party if u order thisCigar burger 9$ cool name n it tastes great jus ask for more sauce!!! Its in an eggroll it was really crunchy but greasy the filling was amaizin i loved the pimento cheese but i wish their was more meat because its mostly cheese other then that i would order it againThe empire burger 14$: this burger was really good the additon of the bacon added a nice salty richness to the dish that was really amaizin like who doesnt want bacon in the actual burger, so that being said it wasnt lacking flavor i liked the egg i love eggs on burgers it makes it really rich. Idk if i liked the cream cheese it was good jus i would have preferred more creativity maybe like a cheesesauce instead or a more rich tasting cheese. I loved the addition of the sweetness of the maple syrup but yet again plz put more idk what is this place skimping on all the saucesSofia loren 14$ this was my least favorite burger ive had here i liked the fresh mozzarella u cant put enough of it, its my favorite cheese that was the only good part of the burger it was really bland and flavorless. The pesto was really bland an a pesto should be really herbaceous n really flavorful. The balsamic reduction wasnt reduced at all it made the burger soggy wouldnt order againFried donuts 8$ texturally really good they were light n fluffy i hate hard donuts n they werent raw in the middle or greasy. Its coated evenly with cinnamon n sugar sometimes the coating isnt on all the donuts this wasnt the case their big n theirs alot of them so u do get ur moneys worth but the sauce was gross they really do need to update it maybe a nutella dipping sauce or u could even put cayenne pepper on the donuts to cut through the richness or the sweetness n add another dessert plz 1 isnt enough"empire-naperville-3,Robyn P.,Iyqe9Vn_OD8_cag6evfBTg,"Bridgeview, IL",0,1,0,40,126,REmKdrK5Ngk3NxbWFIkSCQ,3,11/10/16,The interior is beautiful and what made us want to try it out! It has beautiful wooden walls with metal tables/chairs but the best part is the Edison bulbs above the bar and the spiral staircase that leads to the top floor.The food looked amazing but the meat on our sandwiches were not appetizing at all. We got the turkey burger and the Yardhouse...both of which could have had better meat. The turkey burger looked and tasted like a frozen patty and fried chicken had a very foul taste to it.

Once on their soft opening as part of a fund-raiser, once for the friends and family of investors and then again on a Friday at 6 PM.The restaurant/bar is at the site of the old Rosebud restaurant and overlooks the river. It has an outstanding vibe, cool, recycled decorations, including a bar that is made with some stuff from Charlie Comiskey&#39;s old barn. Comiskey was the original owner of the Chicago White Sox.The service is working through the kinks that come with any new place, but the managers of the place have lots of experience and will get it right.The menu is simple: Burgers (all of which can be converted into chicken or veggie burgers), salads, sandwiches (the hot chicken is fabulous) and fried doughnuts for dessert.Drink menu has some interesting concoctions on it and also a wide array of craft and mainstream beers, all at a good price.Empire is committed to keeping the beer between 37 and 41 degrees from storage, to lines to tap to glass. So you&#39;re assured of a quality pour should you go the tap route. They also make their own nitrogen for the nitro beers.As for the ambiance, there is nothing like it in Naperville. The retractable rooftop, the three balconies, the private party room, the stage - where live music I&#39;m sure will appear eventually - and the big ass bar on the main floor with TV&#39;s all around are all excellent.Welcome to downtown Naperville, Empire!

Â We were promptly seated on the main floor at a booth overlooking the river. The main floor is huge and has a stage set up for live music. Â The dÃ©cor is gorgeous, a nice mix of rustic and industrial. The rooftop deck with retractable roof is a nice touch, along with the other two levels of decks. So many different seating options, depending on the atmosphere you&#39;re looking for.I ordered the Key West turkey burger w/maple bourbon glaze, pineapple, caramelized onions and chili garlic aioli. Wow! Great textures and packed with flavor. The fries were nice and crispy and perfectly seasoned. The bf ordered the Empire burger made with 50/50 beef and ground bacon, spring mix, cream cheese, green onion, maple bourbon glaze and topped with an egg. This was the star of the meal! Oh, and the food came lightning fast! You can also order beer samples for $1 each, which is a great way to try ahead!

They have carafes of water at every table which I really liked.I looked over the menu and it&#39;s not a huge selection, so I opted for the G.O.A.T burger and got the wildflower cocktail.The wildflower cocktail was really good and really strong! So I only opted for one of these since I was going to have to drive home- but If I wasn&#39;t driving I would have had plenty more because they were so good!The G.O.A.T burger - was AMAZING!!

Â We scored a spot at the bar and got a glass and a half into our drinks when our table was ready...doubtful it was even an hour. Â Our server was pretty great...super friendly &amp; quirky! Â We both ordered the GOAT burger... not ginormous, but a good size and good taste. Â Both the fries &amp; chips were good. Â I got the chips, my friend got the fries. Â We were offered dessert...though tempting, we passed. Â The drinks were reasonably priced, the crowd was very mixed from North Central College kids (I&#39;m assuming) in their early 20s-baby boomer age. Â You could hear the band playing from downstairs upstairs, so we decided to head down there to check them out on our way out since we paid for them anyway.

Â It&#39;s very obvious that this was not an inexpensive remodel, this was a complete overhaul.Now on to the food, I was a little surprised at how small the menu is, but I went with a burger, which if you follow me on Yelp, you know is my go to item for new places. Â The menu at Empire is very burger-centric anyhow, so it seemed like a good choice. Â I went with a standard cheeseburger, they have several other burgers on the menu, but none really sounded all that good to me. Â Burgers are served on a pretzel bun and the one I had was cooked just right and tasted great. Â Fries are just okay, pretty standard frozen spuds, fresh cut would have been better, but they were fine. Â Service was also fine, nothing to get excited about, but not bad or anything. Â This is more of an adult type of place, I didn&#39;t see any kids running around, which was nice.

Comfortable, modern, industrial rustic. The upstairs outdoor seating area is the best seat in the house. Lovely. The beer selection is vast and the beer is cold. Perfect. Until dinner was served it was an awesome night. The food is subpar. Ordered the fried chicken sandwich (yardbird?) and it was barely edible. The two pieces of chicken were tough and dry-without flavor.

It&#39;s supposed to come with a sunny side egg on top. It came with a rubbery over cooked mess instead. The romaine lettuce seemed more like iceberg and there was a handful of orange shredded cheese from a bag dumped on top. Why??? The pork was cold, greasy, and inedible.My husband had a burger with chorizo meat that lacked spice, let alone flavor. It was covered in a greasy cheese like substance that seemed to glow from across the table.Between the two of us I think we took 4-5 bites. With drinks and probably the weirdest appetizer I&#39;ve ever had (burger cigars - kind of like deep fried burger egg rolls?) it came out to be the most expensive meal we never ate ($58 + tip).Despite the fact we ate very little of this meal, we were nevertheless plagued by indigestion through the night...The server was nice, though seemed nervous. The drinks were good - the bar menu is plentiful.

Unfortunately, Â not one of the waitstaff had their hair pulled back. We had to be the unfortunate ones to have the waitress with hair longest to her waist..thereby getting in every course of our meal. I tried to be patient in hopes that she would recognize on her own that her hair was sitting in our plates at every turn. Her lack of concern and everyone working with her including the management implies this is BUSINESS AS USUAL. TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE!When she handed me my main entrÃ©e 6 inches of her hair was completely in my plate. I told her &#34;your hair in IN MY FOOD&#34; ..IT HAS BEEN THROUGHOUT every single plate. Her response was &#34;I am sorry I will have another one made&#34;I got up to use the restroom and she was telling her coworkers whose hair was not pulled back either ..that b!tch says apparently my hair was in her food while laughing and was doing something gross Â to the original burger. I told her, please just forget it. I found the manager while the waitress was still was bad mouthing me. Â The manager was apologetic and said he would look at the bill. He ended up taking off my burger which he should have as I did not eat..and we paid the rest of the tab which also had her hair as a condiment. I took pictures but will spare you the disgust.Do yourself a favor and avoid this establishment. Â I guess until the health department gets in there and holds them accountable..you can expect HAIR in your meal.I am utterly disappointed, disgusted and still nauseous.If there were negative stars, it would be most appropriate."empire-naperville-3,Christopher C.,vWig0SgpkN9Tx4WqRk3Vew,"Aurora, IL",0,1,0,0,5,4ae5hMkuq2y-5I1SlcGEag,1,29/10/16,My first visit to Empire having been at both Ballydoyle&#39;s DG and Aurora left a major feeling of disappointment with me.

When we went to go upstairs we were told &#34; no more people are going upstairs&#34; very rudely might I add. The rude bouncer claim to be at max capacity even though our friends had a table with a couple seats waiting for us. Once the manager came, we told him it was my birthday and we picked this place to have a good night. He was also very rude and not once apologized. He made us get a friend come down stairs, I guess to prove that we had a table.We were a younger crowd compare to the people there, mid 20s and the age discrimination was real. We were sitting on the patio and waited to be serve when we saw a waitress serve the tables around us their drinks and even watch her take orders. When we flagged her down she rudely told us they do not have service at this area even though all 9 of us clearly saw her serve and wait on other people. Very sad to say we also heard her tell the table behind us how, &#34; she didn&#39;t trust people her age.&#34; Wow age discrimination much. Her loss we are all really good tippers. Especially since we actually had a few experienced servers with us who understand the struggle of being a server.So only go here if you are older because if not you will not be taken seriously.

The hostess told us 30 minutes, so we went up to the roof to grab drinks while we waited.2 hrs later...We were having fun with just the two of us but realized it was late and we still haven&#39;t been sat.We download the app to check our wait in line... there are still 6 people ahead of us! We go down to talk to the hostess and see many tables open downstairs so we explain we have been waiting for two hours and would like to sit downstairs.She tells us we need to get on the inside wait list... then a guy from upstairs comes down tells the hostess there&#39;s an open table and he wants it because he&#39;s been waiting (behind us) and she gives him the table.It was so messed up! Anyways, we ask to be seated given all the open tables and she reluctantly does... because there was a 30 min wait for downstairs... again lots of open tables.@#%&amp; you.Anyway, our server comes and we explain we would like to speak to the manager (a total waste of time).He comes by and tells us he will talk to the hostess and never comes back.

The servers are trying to work their way through the people waiting. I did not get the young man&#39;s name bringing out food but he was working very hard. One of the hostesses was great and knew her job the other young women were rude. The entrance is also an exit. It was not safe at all for staff trying to bring food to diners.We were told we had a 20 min wait which turned into 50 mins. After a 30 Â min. wait I checked to see approximately how much longer our wait would be and the hostess said 30 to 45 mins ...want to cancel? WOW not great for business.Once we were seated our waitress did not know we had been seated. We waited 10 more mins to order drinks. We ordered our food. Awhile later 5 to 10 mins later my friend was told they didn&#39;t get their delivery of her choice of meat. Shouldn&#39;t the servers be told this before the evening starts? Or updated as they run out of food? The menu is limited. It should not be difficult to update staff.Our burgers were terrible, very greasy. The grease ran down my hand. I couldn&#39;t even eat most of my meal. The waitress only checked on us once about 3 minutes after we got our food. She never came back to offer refills. I don&#39;t blame her she was very busy.The servers and waitresses seemed over worked. More staff is needed.Cannot recommend this place. I had high hopes for Empire.

Upscale bar food, which I&#39;m sure is all the norm in hip Chicago neighborhoods, but totally lacking in Naperville. This type of restaurant was very needed in the downtown Naperville scene and I hope it remains for a long time. I&#39;ve been to Empire 3 times now and have brought new people each time. Every single person at the table, each time we&#39;ve been, has loved their food.I&#39;m told the beer menu is great (I don&#39;t drink beer) and the wine selection is above average (not something you expect from a typical burger bar). Downstairs is dark and industrial and can get pretty loud. They have a stage for a band, but I have not been there when there was live music. Upstairs there is an indoor/outdoor area. The glass panels can open on nice days, or close on hot days. If the doors are closed and the sun is out (glass panel ceiling), it can get VERY hot, as air flow is seriously lacking. They also have a full outdoor patio on the river that I have not experienced yet.While the food is well above average, the service is not. The waitresses (we&#39;ve only seen females) appear unaware of the ever-changing beer menu and are generally not knowledgeable about the beers they serve. They also seem unaware of the offerings of the restaurant - for example, I asked for a side salad instead of fries and received it on my first and second visit. On the third visit, the waitress told me &#34;they don&#39;t do that&#34;. I explained that I had it before and received my salad. I firmly believe this is simply due to the restaurant being in its infancy, and have faith that they will weed out the bad servers and develop a consistent server base.When we did have an issue with the service, managers came by and compensated us for the inconveniences we experienced, restoring our faith in the restaurant as a whole. Overall, I will definitely be back and will continue to bring new people, so long as the service continues to improve (as I have seen it do in the three successive visits thus far)."empire-naperville-3,Carlos R.,3VRVPszAOgTchQMQwbtnBQ,"Aurora, IL",0,1,0,0,14,NswunpGGuYYyCCNjK-thJQ,4,11/09/16,"$18.00 DOUBLE CHEESE BURGERservice was confusing for customer and employees (on a Saturday afternoon)Need some team management, maybe they will get it together?Decent beer selection is the one positive,"empire-naperville-3,Michael M.,Iy5WOdn3Ilxd7Bt3ZCl95A,"Las Cruces, NM",0,1,0,2,20,vibC7qMfesYj03x7m0ROUA,2,17/08/16,I hope it&#39;s because it&#39;s new or that the roof was leaking was why the staff was poorly focused.

First time was on a Thursday night which was fantastic. The second time was on a busy Saturday and was completely different, as the new staff doesn&#39;t seem to know how to handle a crowd. We waited forever to put our names in, and then for another hour to get a table. The upstairs patio is very cool, and we managed to grab a table. We considered eating there but the server only visited us maybe twice in the hour we were there. The food and service downstairs was pretty good when we finally got our table. We enjoyed our burgers and left happy. However, I got very sick later that night and I believe I got food poisoning from Empire, so I won&#39;t be returning anytime soon.

Most likely you&#39;ll get sat on the main floor which has a cozy ambience. You can instead be put on a wait for upstairs, but you usually end up waiting twice as long.

First thing about the eye-popping roof is that when the sun is out you cook! Â It was so hot, I can&#39;t tell you, but luckily we ended with some cloud cover and they closed off a portion and turned on air which made a huge impact. If you don&#39;t like heat, stay off the rooftop!Decor was awesome, first level bar is impressive and the stage is ample sized for bands that are rumored to start around Labor Day. The beer selection is very solid, and we tried several beers we had not even heard of before. Bartenders Ryan and Tyler were awesome and knew their beers and food. We are several things, all delivered efficiently and were tasty. The burger cigars are a must try!! The burger was very good and a nice size along with homemade fries that were awesome. Prices are typical of downtown Naperville. It is obvious they need more bar backs, table cleaning/prep personnel, etc as we observed messy areas sitting way too long as new patrons arrived. Sometimes the cheapest labor can be the most important! Â Overall, we were very impressed with all aspects of the place.

Instead of apologizing and trying to accommodate us she blamed us for not checking the app. This contained to be an ordeal for a half hour and no one knew what was going on.

Apparently it didn&#39;t matter. The rooftop dining is the best aspect of this place, and that&#39;s really just a gimmick. What really matters, service and the food, leave a lot to be desired. We entered Empire and were greeted by an empty hostess stand and a sign that said &#34;please wait to be seated&#34;. Â So we waited. Â And waited some more. This was odd, because the restaurant was virtually empty. When the cute little blonde hostess did finally decide to return, we asked to be seated rooftop. The hostess told us there was a separate stand upstairs for that, and that we needed to go upstairs to that station to be seated. So we walked up the two flights of stairs, only to be told there was at least a 30 minute wait for rooftop dining, but that we could be seated immediately downstairs, in the bar or on the patio. So we trekked back down the stairs to the original hostess to be seated. As we reached the stand, the phone was ringing, so we had to stand there for several minutes while the hostess spoke on the phone. She wouldn&#39;t even acknowledge us while she conducted her conversation. Even a nod in our direction would have meant something. Â Would it be too difficult for the two seating stations to communicate so that people weren&#39;t sent all over the restaurant to be seated? Â A warm welcome costs nothing. The kind of welcome we received shows an appalling lack of customer service. We&#39;d been in a virtually empty restaurant almost 15 minutes so far, and couldn&#39;t buy a seat. And we faced a hostess who couldn&#39;t seem to care less whether we dined at Empire or not. We were finally seated on the patio at a cramped little table that was ill equipped to handle the serving plates for two diners. We feared making any fast moves that might send things like salt and pepper shakers hurling to their deaths in the DuPage River. Not the most comfortable of seating. The wait staff was a vast improvement over the host staff, and is the only reason this restaurant got any stars at all. Both the ladies who waited on us were friendly and efficient. The menu was a joke, however. Mostly burgers, with a few sandwiches and salads. Appetizers that were mostly deep fried and/or greasy. Not much on the menu was innovative, unless you consider Pimiento Cheese to be cutting edge. Menu prices aren&#39;t cheap. Burgers ranging from $14-$18 each should offer something more than what you can get for less money elsewhere. Our bill came to $68 for two appetizers, two burgers, two soft drinks and one bag of doughnuts. Â While we are glad we tried Empire, we won&#39;t return. Â This place has been open less than three months and the service and menu already need a complete overhaul.

Â It was completely over cooked and served with cold fries. I get they have new servers, maybe lacking experience but it&#39;s give the management team ZERO excuse for not coming to check on the 7 tables that are actually sat in the place.

The rooftop seating overlooking the river is what grabbed our attention, but once I saw the menu I knew we&#39;d have to give it a try because my husband loves burgers (especially on pretzel buns). When we walked in we were impressed with the look of everything (very industrial and in with the current trends) but once we heard the 30 minute wait for the rooftop we decided to dine inside. We were seated at a high top table where there was very dim lighting, making it hard to see the menu. About 10 minutes passed and no server had come to greet us or take our drink orders. Finally, the one server we saw working the floor came and asked if we had been seen. After we said no, she said she would go get our server, but then came back and said she would just be helping us. I ordered a pumpkin beer, but was unfortunately brought the wrong one and it took some time for our server to come back for me to let her know. Once I did tell her, she was quickly apologetic and brought me the correct beer with a glass. Food came out quickly and was pretty good. My husband had the Key West burger and said it was good, but the turkey burger itself definitely wasn&#39;t freshly made and we could tell it was just a frozen patty. I had the knockwurst sandwich (sauce was a little spicy) and it was cut into smaller pieces which made it hard to keep on the pretzel bun. We ordered the doughnuts (best part of the meal) and got much more than we expected. Overall, the complaints about poor service are true (but I must say our server did as best she could to make up for that), food was okay (not worth the high prices), beer selection is good, but I doubt we will be back. This is a huge place and they can definitely afford more staffing.

How could a burger be ordered, delivered in minutes and served cold? These are not fresh hand made burgers. We are talking 1/3 pound disks circa your bag of Costco burgers. As for the fries, they were equally as cold. Imagine the broken up fry tidbits at the bottom of your bag of fries in the freezer....Serve them at colder then room temperature and you have Empire. So disappointing. $87.69 was the bill...My wife and I had two burgers and fries, appetizers, two drinks each and we tipped 20%. Go anywhere else in downtown Naperville for a better burger."empire-naperville-3,Emma S.,ORF6KtACsmYyVnHXk3EG0w,"La Grange Park, IL",0,1,0,8,5,EvRzaIl1qs-sQcDUvIJ3gQ,1,09/09/16,"My husband and I decided to go here for lunch on Tuesday as we had an unexpected weekday off from work. Â This was my third time at Empire. Â I felt compelled to write a review after our experience. Â When we walked in at 1pm, there was no one at the hostess stand, yet there was a sign that said, &#34;wait to be seated.&#34; Â We waited there for several minutes before the host showed up. Â We were seated at a booth with a view of the river. Â It was a lovely place to sit. Â There was one other table with customers in the entire downstairs area. Â We sat there for over 15 minutes before we were even greeted by our server! Â I honestly couldn&#39;t believe it. Â He was nice, but throughout the entire meal, he was so slow. He never asked me if I wanted another Coke, even though my glass was empty for the majority of the meal. Â The food was good. We had the poutine fries for an appetizer. Â While these tasted good, the dish is way too small for the price. Â I ordered the Goat burger and fries, and my husband ordered the Empire burger. Â The Goat was very tasty. Â My husband&#39;s burger did not have enough sauce on it. Â They gave me a tiny, silver dish with ketchup for my fries which was not even filled up all the way to begin with. Â I wanted to ask for more ketchup, but I had to wait for over 15 minutes for our server to even look in our direction, even though he had no other tables! Â I finally got to ask him for more ketchup and another Coke. Â He went to get both and was gone for 15 minutes. Â Honestly the service was really bad. Â We really like the food at Empire and the decor, but if the service is going to be this slow and lackadaisical, we are going to think long and hard before coming here again. Â I hate writing this because Empire has so much potential, but they have to step up the service."empire-naperville-3,vanessa m.,s7B6kwKc8wtSlfd8Ikqhvg,"Plainfield, IL",0,1,0,0,22,vtvpUxDzZh3fpbeRna6zxw,2,31/07/16,I think this place was nice.

I love the design and the variety of drinks. The menu; however is very limited and the service can be slow. On my last visit we went upstairs to grab a table near the bar. The hostess said it would be about 5 minutes as they were cleaning 3 tables. We take a seat in the waiting area next to another couple. After about 10 minutes we notice she has begun seating new groups that had just arrived. At one point she checked in and asked if we were this one party. We said that we weren&#39;t and that she never took a name down for us. At this point we are the only ones in the waiting area, so after another 10 minutes we go ask how much longer it would be. She said she totally forgot about us and has now seated others in the previously available tables and that it would be another 30 minutes. We ended up going downstairs and getting a table there. Luckily that host downstairs was able to seat us immediately and our server was very nice and helpful. I really want to like Empire as I was excited for it to open; however, until there is better training for the staff and a larger menu, I&#39;m not sure if I will return."empire-naperville-3,Lindsay B.,KgeK1coHspyMI6RK1wuoBg,"Aurora, IL",0,1,0,2,12,lUI5QJdeBBlTqiXUv5P92g,3,09/09/16,"Rude does not even begin to describe the &#34;customer service&#34; here- and I haven&#39;t even walked in the door yet.

Called this morning to find out how to book a table for 6-8 people this evening and was told to use the &#34;reservation&#34; app NoWait. I was first told that yes, I could put in a reservation if the event was today. Apparently that&#39;s not the case...after calling back, the manager rather rudely explained to me that I could only use this app right before I planned on walking in the door. I then received a lecture on why this establishment does not take reservations or guarantee seating, which I didn&#39;t ask. Thanks, Empire, for not wasting my time dining in your restaurant.

Good beer list. My beer came out with a big hair in it. I brushed it off, it&#39;s hair and was easy to remove. We love scotch eggs so, thought it was a safe bet for an appetizer. When they arrived, the yolks were so undercooked that we could pour them out onto the plate and the meat was RAW. The explanation we got from management, &#34;we soft cook our eggs, I LOVE me some yolk.&#34; He begrudgingly agreed to bring us another batch which arrived after our meal. The second batch was equally runny and raw and were taken off our bill. Their menu is mostly burgers, but those were unremarkable. My bun was so soggy it disintegrated, and it was just a plain cheeseburger. My husbands teriyaki burger left a puddle of sauce on the plate. The fries had some potential.

It has a great location in downtown Naperville, just adjacent to the Riverwalk, and plenty of nearby parking. The interior is the perfect mix of modern and rustic - lots of wooden furnishings and super cool lighting. They also have a rooftop bar (where the roof opens) and will have a private party room upstairs. Everyone was beyond friendly, and our server, Luis, could not have been better! He really treated us right! Empire has a great selection of drinks, and a menu to please everyone. We ordered 3 of the signature cocktails - Eli Whitney, Wildflower, and The Beet Goes On, which were all fantastic. The &#34;Guinness&#34; shot was crazy good, too. We also ordered some appetizers to share - Empire Tots, Poutine Fries, and Burger Cigars. Everything was so good, but I&#39;d have to say The Burger Cigars, in particular, were out of this world!

We got up to hostess to find out our table had been given away. Not happy... We waited again. Then we were told they had a table for us. Oh, wait, no! Another False alarm. Someone else had dibs on that table. Finally got seated somewhere else. Put in drinks order..they only had 2 out of 5 drinks we ordered that were on the menu. They ran out of ginger ale, grenadine AND the beer my husband ordered. First they told him they were changing the keg, then later said they were out of the beer all together. Server didn&#39;t offer other options, just brought water. Appetizer was very slow in coming. Finally ordered food. Only 2 out of 3 entrees came out together. We thought they forgot about my husbands order, but no, they just brought it way later than all the others. Who does that?! I ordered my burger medium and it was rare. Super raw and gross. I had to ask twice for a 2nd mojito (which by the way was half the size of a regular mojito galas and was still $10). Water glasses remained empty most of our meal. Had to ask for more.

The only problem we had was that some of the food we ordered wasn&#39;t made. I ordered filet mignon and scallops and my husband ordered filet and chicken. The cook seemed flustered at one point and he said something to the waiter. My husband and I each got our steak but not the other food. Then he cleaned the grill. I was disappointed and couldn&#39;t figure out why we didn&#39;t get all our food. My husband mentioned it to the waiter and he said Someone was bringing it. So we did end up getting it but afterwords. It wasn&#39;t the cooks fault as he just cooks what&#39;s on the platter. So I realized that&#39;s why he panicked a bit. He saw that he was missing food. It would have been nice to eat that with the rest of the meal. We will definitely try again. Just hoping that was a one time mistake.aodake-sushi-and-steak-house-romeoville,Shaniqua D.,IwVp7GGcL_xjCUzURKJyiA,"Chicago, IL",0,1,0,12,10,ajoB-KDRAdv3y_-O5ou5ng,4,14/05/16,"The slowest service I&#39;ve ever received in MY LIFE!!

Truth is my family and I have been coming here for over 4 years and we have always been happy with the food and service we have received, I even threw 2 parties of over 30 people here, but I must say that last Sunday my family and I went there an hour before closing a total of 10 ppl and the service was less than poor. We sat at the Habachi table and the food was way too salty and no other flavor other that soy sauce. We got less that half a cup of rice and about 1/4 cup of veggies. Now if you&#39;ve ever gone to a Habachi grill you know that you usually get ALOT of rice and veggies with your order. This time we got nothing for the high price we paid and the staff was making sure we were aware that hey we&#39;re ready to leave. Â Now I called the next day to complain about the service food quality and portion and was told that hey would take care of it and we would get a gift card for our trouble, well today we received a $40 dollar card which for a bill of 350.00 is nothing they basically gave us back our tip. Well to the management thank you hit no thank you! I will be returning it as probably need it more than we do. Not to sound snotty but this is really unfortunate to one of your one time customers.

The service was horrible, from having to repeat what we wanted to eat, to trying to convince the server that we COULD order something on the menu (she kept saying they don&#39;t have that, my husband had to show her on the menu). She only saw us once after we ordered and got salad and soups. She never cleared, manager had to come start it, then server runs up freaking out. We ask for box, and we get that. Â Wait for 10 minutes after for check, my husband has card out she she takes it immediately. 15 minutes later, we have not even seen her.

She does not understand.Then a few more minutes and the manager comes up and hands the check to the other party at our table, turns to leave. Â We ask where is our check?

I do suggest getting their noodles instead of their rice. It&#39;s kind of garlicky and I like it a lot.The hibachi chef likes to squirt watered down sake down your throat and kind of makes you messy. I feel like that the hibachi chefs have a funny young way about them and is best for younger adult crowds.

We have only been to the Romeoville Location, but have been there several times. Besides great food Aodake has offers a bit of fun to your meal. I feel that their prices are also a little bit more reasonable than some other Japanese Steak Houses that we have been to.Aodake is pronounced ah-oh da&#39; key and besides typical Japanese Steak House food they also have sushi and great appetizers.

They also will squirt rice wine in your mouth but if you are not interested you can just say no. I do not drink alcohol but my son has done it on occasion. I am not a big fan of this practice but a lot of people really enjoy it.We like to go to Aodake for lunch and they have a special happy hour menu. You can get any of the meals and it seems to save you about $3. You do have to offer a beverage with it, but most people will do that anyway. The only difference that I have noticed with the happy hour menu is that they leave out the bean sprouts.The first course is a bowl of soup. It is a light broth with a few mushrooms and some onions. The soup is yummy and a nice start to the meal.Next they bring out the salads which are individually made and have their own special dressing. The dressing is unique to these type of restaurants and the closest thing I can think of is Thousand Island. We all love the little salads.Everyone is given regular silver wear, as well as wood chop sticks. I like to use the chop sticks to get the full experience.Each meal comes with fried rice which is delicious. I can not eat fried rice because I am on a low carb diet so I just order and extra portion of vegetables and find it very filling without going over on my carbs.After the salads the cook comes out and starts making your meal. Each person will get a shrimp appetizer plus whatever they ordered. I usually get shrimp so I just get a couple extra. My daughter loves to get the steak and chicken and my husband gets the steak and scallops. I have tasted all of them and they use high quality meats.While the chef is cooking he will usually put on a bit of a show with eggs, fire just some fun. You will not be disappointed in the fun, the food or the reasonable prices."aodake-sushi-and-steak-house-romeoville,Heidi Y.,K49h2oPEe_JrIJrQcWae2g,"Romeoville, IL",0,1,0,24,29,bOLv8KoQtwgwOvQri_EW7w,4,12/01/16,I really love this place.

Â There was another couple that came in about 5mins after us and they gave them the lunch menu. Â I asked about that and the manager asked if Â I wanted to sit Â at another table? Â It is almost like they don&#39;t like the groupons. Â We used one for my birthday dinner and they didn&#39;t want to let us use it because I forgot to show them when we came in.

This one has been here for a while and I think the quality has steadily declined over the past couple of years.We frequent this place maybe once a quarter or so as my wife really likes the hibachi style dinner, so review focuses on the hibachi offering.As hibachi restaurants go, this is exactly what you expect. You sit around an 8-10 person table, your chef comes and prepares the lion&#39;s share of your meal in front of you on a large flattop.Hibachi dinner consists of soup, salad, fried rice, vegetables, and your choice of protein. Soup is largely some kind of beef / chicken broth with a dried mushroom floating in it. The salad is iceberg lettuce and a cucoumber slice with a great ginger dressing. At this point in the meal, the chef comes out with all the table&#39;s food on a cart and starts preparing the meal. Most of the time the chefs we seem to get at our table seem to be rather lame, definitely fatigued from catching eggs in their hat and performing the onion volcano 6 nights a week. However, I have realized that the more excitable the crowd at their table is, the more excitable they will get. Your kids will love it though!As for the food prepared at the table, it&#39;s generally good but inconsistent between chefs. Sometimes you get your vegetables first, sometimes you get your fried rice first, other times we&#39;ve gotten the protein first. I&#39;ve ordered my steak teryaki style before and it&#39;s been prepared without it, when I brought it to the chef&#39;s attention he just squirted some teryaki sauce on my plate. I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve ever had a bad meal here though.What I do feel though is Groupon has kind of ruined this restaurant. They offer Groupon deals quite frequently, and though it is a good deal, the place has seem to have gone downhill the last year or so. I can&#39;t quite describe it, but it just seems to have gotten &#34;less classy&#34;."aodake-sushi-and-steak-house-romeoville,Parosh S.,WP5esDfDRzUbymeNPsx0AA,"Romeoville, IL",0,1,0,3,9,MLjzWyy8b77jcu1j3GRNRw,3,23/07/15,"LOVE this place!

My girlfriend and I dined there on a Sunday and had a terrible experience. After we were seated we hadn&#39;t had anyone come to our table for 20 minutes. Multiple people had been seated after us and had received service before us. Finally after 25 minutes my girlfriend was able to flag another server down from another section who quickly took both our drink and food order. We waited another 10 minutes still no drinks. Not even a single person came by our table to ask how we were doing. Â At this point I made my way up front to ask for a manager. Turns out our server was never notified that we were seated in her section. As I walked back to the table I saw our server laughing about the whole situation; for me waiting almost 40 minutes and not even getting water I can&#39;t say I saw the humor in that. The person that took our order previously didn&#39;t even put it in the system so when we got our food you can tell the rolls were made hastily due to the fact that they were falling apart as we grabbed them. Â My girlfriend had a Groupon which is the main reason we went, the server took her phone without asking to apply the coupon and then dropped both the bill and the phone at a different table. Needless to say we didn&#39;t leave a tip and we will not be returning.

At least once every few weeks. There food is the best around. They always have Groupon deals which is awesome! But it seems ever since they started the Groupon deals they have become to popular and haven&#39;t hired any more staff. Every time we go the wait, unless you made a reservation, is long especially on Friday or Saturday night which is to be expected, but you just can tell there is NO organization. The woman who is the owner or the manager is always running around like a crazy person trying to help the people at the front desk but you can tell she is making it worse. You have to wait a really long time to get a refill, the waitress usually has a ton of tables and you never know where they disappear to. They aren&#39;t any where to be found and then they appear from the kitchen area looking frantic. I don&#39;t know if they have them helping in back as well as waiting tables but the service has gone noticeably down hill a lot since we first started going there. We use to joke that the waiters would hover, as soon as you took the last bite of something they were right there to pick up the empty plate. Now you have to hunt someone down or grab a random worker running past you to get a refill or to take the tower of plates from you. The food is outstanding but give yourself a long time for your meal unless you go at an off time. I highly recommend the godzilla, the dragon and the volcano rolls. All of them are my favorites.

The person taking the reservation talked us into coming later than we wanted by promising that we wouldn&#39;t have to wait.We arrived at 7:50 P.M. for our 8 P.M. reservation. The place was packed and there was barely anywhere to stand to cheek in. We were told it would be 45 minutes to 1 hour. No apology or anything. Â The most annoying thing is that they had asked for my phone number when I made the reservation. Â One would think they could call and let me know they were running late, especially after promising we wouldn&#39;t have to wait by coming later.After about 1 hour, we were finally seated. Â It was freezing cold in the place and it felt like the air conditioner was blowing directly on us even though it was about 10 degrees outside. Â Some people in my party were so cold they had to eat with their coats on the whole time.We ordered our meals and also ordered the hibachi noodles. Â Come to find out, ordering the noodles (which cost extra) somehow replaces the fried rice that comes with the meal. Â We asked for the rice we were supposed to get and it came toward the end of the meal from the kitchen. Â The rice was good but they charged us about $9.00 for 3 servings for something that was supposed to be part of the meal.The food was good and so was the chef. Â He did all the normal hibachi shenanigans and was entertaining.To top it all off, were where there celebrating a birthday. Â Apparently for birthdays they come and bang some drum and sing, along with bringing a piece of cake or something. Â It&#39;s more embarrassing than anything but I wanted to get payback on someone who let Chili&#39;s know it was my birthday and embarrassed me. Â I let the hostess know about the birthday and I also let the waitress know. Â By the end of the meal, the place was pretty empty with only 2 or 3 other tables remaining.

I ordered temaki rolls and about 40 mins later after everyone received their meal I finally got my rolls but their gave me maki instead.

So we asked for some more bread. &#34;So the stale bread was so good now you want more&#34; was his comment. I kept my cool but started my Yelp comment as I was waiting for my food. Ryan must have looked over my shoulder and discovered what I was doing. So he comes over and says &#34;BTW my name is Ryan if you want to add it to the review.&#34;All these many years at Jimmy&#39;s place and I have never had even a hint of bad service. I am sure the food was great. Did not wait for it. I hope that Ryan has a better day tomorrow than today.

Both the Cajun Surf and Turf and Coconut Shrimp were cold to lukewarm when served.

Â I&#39;ve found the food here to be better than Shanahan&#39;s in Forest Park, and although the atmosphere isn&#39;t quite as lively as it is at Pappadeaux in Westmont, the excellent service more than makes up for it.On a gorgeous weeknight in early March, I met my dinner companion here for some good ole&#39; Creole. Â I was early to arrive so I ordered the house specialty drink--a hurricane--and looked over the menu. Â To my amazement, I wasn&#39;t carded for the strong cocktail (which came with a lovely adornment of beads). Â Eventually my date arrived and we put in an order for noms.Once again, I started with their &#39;hot as a mutha&#39; appetizer, which is a habanero pepper filled with Chihuahua cheese, breaded &amp; deep-fried, then served atop a tropical salsa medley that included mango and green bell peppers. Â For connoisseurs of spicy things, it&#39;s a great little firecracker of an item, largely due to the fact that the kitchen doesn&#39;t remove the seeds or the veins prior to preparation. Â For $6, I&#39;d happily do it again.There&#39;s so much to choose from on their menu, but I ultimately decided on the Mardi Gras platter, which essentially gave me a little bit of everything. Â It came with: BBQ ribs, jerk chicken wings, shrimp &amp; andouille sausage eggrolls, crab cakes, jalapeno corn blasters, and cajun chicken bites. Â I also got a cup of gumbo with it, which was a pleasant surprise. Â After sampling a bit of everything, I came to the conclusion that everything was at least &#39;good&#39; (a few things were &#39;great&#39;) and nothing sucked.The huge wall of hot sauces is a sight to behold, but they&#39;re strictly decorative, so don&#39;t touch Â [even if you&#39;re tempted {as I was}, they&#39;re glued down/cemented to the shelf, so those bottles ain&#39;t goin anywhere]. Â Green, yellow, and purple streamer-like things fluttered on the ceiling, and New Orleans-themed art hung on the wall opposite the hot sauces. Â This place has a great vibe to it; it&#39;s really hard not to love.Ironically, the last time I was here on 7/4/14, I had the exact same server (Steve, the bald guy) who once again did a terrific job. Â He was the perfect balance of engaging and genuine that took a 4.5-star meal into 5-star territory.Bread = 4.5Circuses = 5!I&#39;ve had a couple terrific experiences at NaperThrill&#39;s Heaven on Seven, so I think it&#39;s time to give the original downtown location a shot. Â I gotta imagine the food and atmo is as enjoyable there as it is here (at least, I hope)."heaven-on-seven-naperville,Zubair K.,ORwjDj54rMl2M_h0FmMEaQ,"Chicago, IL",1,1,1,66,141,8CsNOEdiSXO8CLsLpWH7Lg,5,16/09/16,"Not a fan of the restaurant because most of the dishes we ordered turned up sweet.

Â I hunt down jambalaya, and I&#39;ve had a lot over the years - good, bad, and everything else in between. Â I think the jambalaya at Heaven on Seven, in Naperville, is my fav-o-rite! Â It was better than the one at the Wabash location, better than anything I&#39;ve made, and better than anything else I&#39;ve gotten at other restaurants.Geez, I can&#39;t even clearly remember anything else I got, despite being stone-cold sober. Â I remember telling my pals that the gumbo was really good, and I made a mental note in my head about the etouffee also being really good... But it&#39;s all just overshadowed by how body-slamming awesome the jambalaya was. Â If I could feel complex human emotions, I probably would have wept while eating this. Â The service was also great, and the meal was even better because of the fun atmosphere.

They were able to seat us right away, and close to the live band which was nice to hear but sorta loud. The whole place was loud.Our server was super friendly, even offered to have us split our entree when we said we wanted the same thing. This was an excellent choicw because we didn&#39;t even finish between the both of us. We had the wings for an appetizer and they were so good but incredibly spicy. So if youre sensitive, beware. The drinks were as expected, nothing to knock your socks off but good.Atmosphere was exciting. People seemed to have a great time.

And there is a pretty decent beer selection at the bar too.I was a bit hungry so I kinda went all out on the Creole experience and went with the gumbo, side of jambalaya and the Angry Chicken poboy. And when they say angry...it&#39;s pretty angry. Not recommended if you don&#39;t want any stomach complications. But the gumbo and the jamalaya definitely hit the spot.You can taste a lot of southern flavors coming out of the gumbo and jambalaya.And I still wasn&#39;t done. I went for the banana ice cream cake. Ok, maybe I went overboard, but that was a great way to finish the meal.Great place, great beer selection. Love their collection of hot sauces on the wall.

My husband and I have stopped in a while ago just to grab a drink at the bar (because they had Zombie Dust on tap!), but we finally came in to eat dinner just last weekend. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s that we built up Heaven on Seven in our heads this whole time, or that we just had too high of expectations, or if we assumed we&#39;d love it because my parents do. Whatever it was, it was not the experience I had hoped for.We walked in on a Saturday evening at about 6:30 pm and had to wait for a table. This was no big deal though - we just grabbed a couple spots up at the bar. They have a really great beer and cocktail list. I got the St. Germaine cocktail which was pretty and delicious. I appreciate that the bartender gave me a baby sized carafe of the extra champagne! Hubby got Woodford Reserve on the rocks (typical).Once we were sat, our server explained the specials and brought complimentary pickles and bread for the table. We thought this was interesting but as always, were down to try anything. The pickles were seasoned with some sort of glaze. I like it, but not sure my husband did. The bread was a bit dry and hard for my liking, but I think the butter had honey in it because that was really good.We started with a suggested app from our server - their shrimp and andouille egg rolls which come with spicy mustard, ginger mango sauce and Asian slaw. I really enjoyed these egg rolls, but again, my husband not so much. It was a little unfortunate that our waiter did not warn us how spicy these would be! I mean sure, I read spicy mustard on the menu, but I did not see anything about jalapeno peppers! Luckily I like spicy, but some bites were just not even worth the heat. Although this app comes with 4 large egg rolls, I still thought $12.99 was a bit too much to pay for it.For my entree I knew I wanted something with shrimp, so I scoured their like 10 different options. I was toying between two different things, so I really appreciated it when our server brought out the two different sauces for me to try. I actually liked them both, so he ended up suggesting the shrimp creole over rice with a sweet &amp; tangy tomato sauce. You can get the shrimp dishes in 3 different sizes - appetizer (4 shrimp), entree (6), or Jimmy size (10). I went with the entree which I thought was a good sized portion. Again, I thought $20.99 was a bit steep for 6 shrimp, rice, and sauce, but it was very tasty. My husband got the salmon and crab cake special and was unimpressed. That&#39;s actually the first time I&#39;ve seen him not even want to take home leftovers. Both entrees came with soup or salad and we both selected soup. My husband got the gumbo and I went with their shrimp and corn soup. I honestly did not care for it - way too sweet.My overall feeling is that we will be back for drinks or a light bite, but I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be dropping such a hefty bill here anytime soon. Just not worth it."heaven-on-seven-naperville,Rose S.,aiJiaO8o8Nv8qq_Cg5nfRQ,"Plainfield, IL",0,1,0,68,76,AzQFZ1630pILPECyFbof4Q,3,26/07/16,"Oh my goodness. SO DELICIOUS.

It was. I ordered that and their tasty take on Eggs Benedict. My other half ordered a country fried steak dish. Both dishes came with a buttload of pancakes-our server was so nice and opted to count my gumbo as my side so we wouldn&#39;t have to eat our way through 20 pounds of pancake.Service was quick and portions were great.

We ordered online which was fairly easy, drove to downtown Naperville to pick up the food, and walked in. Our food was already waiting at the front counter even though we had just placed the order 10 minutes before. Mind you - this place wasn&#39;t extremely busy where I&#39;d imagine they have multiple meals prepared and ready to go. I was surprised, but optimistic when I grabbed the food.Fast forward to when we get home: we open the bag, and then the disappointment starts. We had ordered $50 worth of food - what we go looked like $30 dollars worth of food. Everything was flavorless. I&#39;m one for spicy food, and I just didn&#39;t even get a hint of taste out of anything. The only dish that I semi-enjoyed was the &#39;Hot As A Mutha&#39; which of course was spicy, but nothing I couldn&#39;t handle.I think I was just expecting more for $50 dollars worth of take out.

It really bothered me, but my husband didn&#39;t notice anything. I will say the food was decent-okay. 3/5. But the service was 4/5. Not too bad, but nothing that wowed me. Food was pretty good actually.Appetizers: bayou Jalepeno blastera. Deep fried corn bread with pockets of cheese and sweetness. Really good dipping sauce. Definitely recommendGratis bread: nothing special. Cold, clearly not house made, it had a slight rubbery bite indicative of it not being fresh, and at least out for the last 8 hours. Served with a honey butter. That butter was definitely delicious.Entree: I got the coconut shrimp with mango-papaya paint (yes paint). Presentation was good. There was a red curry sauce that came with my dish that they put in a half coconut shell. The mango-papaya sauce (paint) was an utter dissappointment. It basically was a Alphonso mango purÃ©e from a can from a local Hispanic or Indian grocery store. (While I&#39;m an absolute fan of canned Alphonso mango purÃ©e, I don&#39;t expect it in a dish if I&#39;m eating out!). The red curry sauce had a very strange aftertaste, as if there was some form of Â a strong preservative in it. The coconut shrimp itself was excellent though.Other entree: chicken enchiladas. This was good, my husband got this one. Definitely recommend.Skipped dessert as we were not impressed overall.TL;DR: very annoying smell. Skip this place, try another place that takes Cajun a bit more seriously and uses quality ingredients (i.e. fresh mango, and not mango puree out of a can) to hit that authentic flavor."heaven-on-seven-naperville,Kaylee M.,JsJ732-GJ465AFnQhqruIw,"Downers Grove, IL",0,1,0,2,131,Kda5im85f5JDjyuXVoQs1Q,2,22/01/16,"Gave this place two chances because of all the hype and was left beyond disappointed both times.We placed a togo order for the crab cakes, fried chicken po&#39; boy with fries, fried green tomatoes and a jalapeÃ±o corn muffin.Crab cakes were cold, but probably the best tasting thing in our order.The fried chicken po&#39; boy was very disappointing. To start, the chicken was dry, there was no remoulade or any kind of sauce on the sandwich or on the side and they forgot the fries all together.We are big fans of fried green tomatoes but these were just awful and also, cold.The jalapeÃ±o corn muffin was without question, a day or two old and hard as a rock. Didn&#39;t even take a bite.I want to add that we picked up our order 20 minutes after placing it so under no circumstances should any of the food have been cold or even room temp.For prices as high as Heaven on Seven&#39;s, there is no excuse for anything to be less than par.

I had heard sooooo much about this place over the years, and even worked just a few blocks away from it, but had just never been. The first time that I went was a social invite with a group of friends. Such a fun place for meeting up with a group! I&#39;ve been back a few times since, generally always to meet up with friends or to take folks who are visiting from out of town.Though they have a unique cuisine and a pretty hefty menu, my favorite thing about the restaurant is the location. Being in the heart of downtown Naperville it is always a good time, and the restaurant itself has a great ambiance and wonderful feel to it. I see many other reviewers mention the wait, though I have not personally had that problem. But, the times that I&#39;ve been there it has always been in the afternoon, so that is probably why.If you love cajun food or even if you&#39;re just curious about it and want to try it out (as I was), this is a great place to expand your horizons. I love spicy food but had never tried anything even remotely cajun before I went here. I like trying new things though and so chose the gumbo and jambalaya. Both were quite good, very meaty and hearty. Since, I&#39;ve also tried the chicken pot pie and turtle soup. I&#39;d say my favorite dish is the pot pie, which isn&#39;t in pie form but is very rich and creamy, with a wonderful flavor. They do give you a lot of food (and it is probably not the healthiest place ever) but it is definitely enjoyable.The times that I&#39;ve gone the service has been pretty average. I&#39;ve yet to find that &#34;amazing&#34; wait staff experience, but they keep the drinks going and don&#39;t leave you waiting too long to place your order. Nothing spectacular but no complaints either.If you&#39;re looking for a place to take friends for a great experience, with decent food, this is a fantastic pick. The food doesn&#39;t blow me out of the water, but it is always a good time and the prices are fair for what you get."heaven-on-seven-naperville,Lisa M.,7Nf3rzaIRu_K5T6QO74wcw,"Naperville, IL",0,1,1,16,2,u-TU01LVxPSo9yJCCuA-eQ,3,10/09/15,Voodoo Chicken Enchiladas are the bomb!I love Heaven on Seven!

I have always lumped Michigan Ave restaurants in the same category as restaurants around Time Square. --no one in their right mind should ever consider eating at any restaurant around there. --TGIF anybody? Gross. Â Actually, just avoid Time Square altogether.But, one chilly late Autumn night, my hubs and I were doing some Christmas shopping in downtown Naper and he suggested we thaw out with some spicy food. Actually, he is a burning furnace, so I was the one in need of thawing. We both have a healthy love of heat and Heaven had immediate seating; so, after years of never giving this restaurant a glance, I found myself sitting in their Naper location.Tables are packed in. You especially feel this when you&#39;re sharing your space with the vast majority of women with their big coats and big bags.I love the gumbo. It&#39;s really thick, but that&#39;s how I like it. Has layers of deep flavors. It has nice heat, but mostly in the sausage. --The rice helps balance everything.The bread basket = Awful. Stale and tasteless. I should volunteer my services and help them out. Â ;)Voodoo Chicken. Never again. I know it&#39;s a classic here, but it was SWIMMING in cheese. So much cheese I was gagging.

I don&#39;t need to eat anything else. In fact, it&#39;s all for me; buy your own.It&#39;s a step above Chilis for sure, but not a place I can be talked into more than once a year.

The menu is filled with tons mouth watering options but is not overwhelming. Dining with a friend, we decided to split the fried green tomatoes with gulf shrimp and Louisiana crab cakes with a remoulade sauce appetizer. It was nothing short of satisfying. The portions are hearty are great for sharing. The crab cakes were light and flavorful and came with a generous amount of sauce to compliment the cakes. The fried tomatoes were cooked to perfection without an overload of breading. The shrimp were so juicy and tender that we decided we needed to order more shrimp dishes as our main course.We decided on the buffalo shrimp over rice &amp; coconut shrimp with rice &amp; dipping sauce. They were both phenomenal. The sauces were immensely flavorful. Tasting &amp; adding a few of their many hot sauces on the table to our dishes kicked them up a notch further than they already were.While we planned on dessert, there was simply no room in our stomachs afterwards. However, the drink special of the day (the hurricane) was a perfect pairing to our meal. You get a surprisingly large glass for only 7$.I am/look forward to going back to this restaurant.

Heaven on Seven is a hidden treasure chest, not much to look at on the outside, but we all know the inside is really where it&#39;s at. A huge menu of various cajun/Creole food specialties and fun wall decors of various types of hot sauces.We came on a Thursday evening and it wasn&#39;t super packed, but still busy. We were greeted and drink orders were taken. The sweet tea is quite delicious (not too sweet) and free re-fills! Our party of 4 ordered: fried green tomatoes with crabmeat, a bowl of gumbo, 3lb crawfish boil special, shrimp and grits and &#34;appetizer size&#34; coconut shrimp.Fried green tomatoes with crabmeat (yelp.com/biz_photos/heavâ€_) - at first I was skeptical ordering this, but like they said anything fried has to be good and boy was this one of the highlights of our meal. The crabmeat complimented the fried green tomatoes very well and the breading of the green tomatoes was light.Bowl of gumbo (yelp.com/biz_photos/heavâ€_) - left a lot to be desired. This was highly recommended so we decided to go for the bowl, which we didn&#39;t finish. It was kind of lukewarm and just left us wanting something more. Maybe more of a kick or seasoning.3lbs crawfish broil (yelp.com/biz_photos/heavâ€_) - our first thought when this came was &#34;is this really 3lbs?&#34; The crawfish was meh, some of it was way too salty and not enough spice and juiciness.Coconut shrimp (yelp.com/biz_photos/heavâ€_) - I love that the curry sauce came in a coconut shell, how clever, unfortunately the curry sauce didn&#39;t taste like anything and it was bland, but the coconut shrimps themselves were big and delicious. The rice mixture was a combination of rice and potatoes that compliment the shrimps very well.Shrimps and grits (yelp.com/biz_photos/heavâ€_) - BEST. SHRIMP. AND. GRITS. I&#39;VE. EVER. HAD. This was by far the best dish of the night (okay, so maybe the fried green tomatoes were up there too). This dish is definitely not skimpy of shrimp, it almost felt like AYCE. The grits were perfect texture and had just enough Parmesan-reggiano. The tasso ham, shiitake mushrooms and green onions enhance the dish by ten folds. I&#39;m seriously drooling just thinking about this dish and recommends everyone to try it because before you know it you&#39;ll be licking the plate clean.A little miss-hap is the server forgot to bring our our jalapeno cheddar corn muffin that I was really looking forward to trying, but honestly forgot about it since I was falling in love with the shrimp and grits (the reason why this place is getting a 4 star even though I rate it 3.5). She did apologize and ask if we wanted to take it to go, but what would we cherish it with? There was no more grits or gumbo to eat it with. Oh well, just another reason for us to come back and try their other dishes."heaven-on-seven-naperville,Carole C.,lzHMyYq3cfDAY3vHC-uC9w,"Aurora, IL",1,1,1,161,112,NneobcEuB7STbPcaVzLSBg,4,25/08/15,"If you boast a &#34;Nawlins&#34; menu you should make a really good gumbo and great po&#39; boys!

I remembered that there&#39;s a Heaven On Seven out there -- Heaven On Seven was always her favorite restaurant in Chicago (and one of mine) but we&#39;ve really been missing the old Rush Street location...and we saw that the menu at the Naperville location is virtually identical to that of the now-closed Rush/Ohio location.We ordered our old favorites. There are a few subtle differences, but it was still the Heaven On Seven we&#39;ve always loved.I have no idea why there is a sudden rash of bad reviews recently. From our experience, everything was top notch. The food (kind of a hybrid of the various flavors Jimmy Banos gathered from his travels to New Orleans and a hint of Italian cuisine influenced by his Italian mother) is exactly what I expected (although if the Rush Street location was any indications the po&#39; boys were not New Orleans quality), very delicious, very filling. Glad to see the bread and honey butter from Rush was here, along with a savory spread that I don&#39;t remember seeing at the other Heaven locations.Service: absolutely wonderful. Shannon was an excellent server and very patiently dealt with my wife and me as we were blindly ordering as if it were the old Rush Street location (again, there were subtle differences we weren&#39;t ready for), and the kitchen accommodated my wife&#39;s special request of etouffÃ© as a side item.Only explanation I can think of for the people giving Heaven On Seven bad ratings are that Napervillains are so suburban...they probably think that if you want a good burger you go to freakin&#39; Culver&#39;s (yuck!) or that Olive Garden is quality Italian cuisine....and they&#39;re not used to real food that&#39;s not loaded with preservatives.Hey, suburbanites...this is what REAL food tastes like. Great flavor without the extra salty crap of your suburban sprawl places.My only complaint -- and not big enough to dock a star off my review -- is that the bathroom doesn&#39;t have a map of New Orleans painted on the wall like the now-defunct Rush Street location had....but a nice compromise is the beautiful artwork on the wall for sale, proceeds going to help those still suffering from Katrina.Oh...and take my advice: get the gumbo.

I approached the reception podium when a slovenly young lady slowly approached. I told her I was here to pick up and order for the Laine party, she asked me to sign the receipt then walked away, and began serving drinks and food. She said nothing, so I went to the bar and told them I was here to pick up an order and how would the kitchen know if no one told them, the girl at at the bar stated that the slovenly young lady would tell them. Â Ok....so when? So, I asked miss slovenly again, she said they are packing it up.I continued to wait another 20 minutes with no word from the slovenly hostess, another young women came out with 3 to go orders, 2 others were waiting for carry out as well. Maybe if the young hostess had any level of communication skills this would not have been so frustrating. Â The customer service at the front of the house, due to the employee is desperately lacking in simple decorum. Â If the hostess is too lazy to get the orders as they are done, and customers are told a wait time that is erroneous! and when you finally get the order it is not even correct.It was not busy....maybe that&#39;s a sign of the times here.

Their environment was pretty interesting. They have someone singing live, and they have a whole wall of different sauces. It is cool to watch. Their hostess was very welcoming and friendly.Their menu is okay to me. They have a wide selection of food and drink, but they don&#39;t have much cuisines for crawfish or crabs. I saw the crawfish boil special on Yelp picture, but when I asked, I was informed that it is seasonal, and it ended in June.So I ended up getting their Cajun (sp?) styled fish covered crab cake. It looks really good, and it has a pretty generous portion. However, I wish it could be slightly more savory, and the crab cake was also slightly overcooked to me.It is a fun dinning experience. I want to come back to try their crawfish boil platter next year."heaven-on-seven-naperville,Heidi K.,oz-Kfz_tDfPQE19CsZy_tg,"Naperville, IL",1,1,1,41,8,l3rVd-i5WdhD-9-EtouUsg,3,16/10/13,"I&#39;ve been here about five times now, and each time the food has been exceptional. I generally get the same thing, but you stick with what you like, right?I L-O-V-E the decor. As a hot sauce fanatic, I enjoy browsing the Wall of Sauce. It reminds me of Pepper Palace in New Orleans with the amount of hot sauces they have displayed.My favorite dish has to be the Orzolaya; it&#39;s jambalaya, but with orzo instead. I don&#39;t like shrimp (it comes with it) so I always order without, and only one time did my order have shrimp on it (no biggie, I just picked &#39;em off. Not like I&#39;m allergic).The Fried Green Tomatoes with the Warm Remoulade Sauce is fantastic! It&#39;s a large appetizer, perfectly filling for two people.The Mardi Gras Jambalaya has a nice spicy kick to it.Andouille Sausage Po&#39; Boy - spicy and filling! I like carmelized onions, but in moderation. They are generous with them, so tell &#39;em to go easy on the onions if you don&#39;t want them to overwhelm the sandwich.The Muffaletta is absolutely devine. You can order it hot or cold, which is nice. I&#39;ve had it both ways and you can&#39;t go wrong with either. The olive salad is house made, the bread is soft, and the meats and cheeses were of great quality. I&#39;ve only seen it on the menu during Mardi Gras, so hurry in and try it.The Chicken and Andouille Sausage Quesadilla is dynamite... the Cilantro Cream and Roasted Red Pepper Sauce are both so flavorful.Louisiana Crab Cakes w/ Honey Jalapeno Dressing - you get two good sized crab cakes, served in a beautiful sea of their honey jalapeno dressing, with diced bell pepper garnish.The Creole Omelette is awesome. Â The sauce served over the top is mild but flavorful.Texas Chili Omelette w/cheddar cheese &amp; pico de gallo, comes with choice of toast and breakfast potatoes - The fiance has had this, and said it was probably the best thing ever. I&#39;ll take his word on that. He&#39;s also had the Chicken Voodoo Enchiladas and the Poached Eggs on Crab Cakes with Creole Sauce.Then there&#39;s the gumbo. I&#39;ve been to New Orleans twice, and let me tell you- HO7&#39;s is the best gumbo outside of NOLA. The best part? You can order a large quantity of it, and freeze it for later. Of course, later never comes because the other half and I will eat a gallon of it in two days.I&#39;m a huge Bloody Mary fan, and they have two different kinds; one with bacon, and a spicy one. The bacon one was just &#34;meh&#34;; I honestly couldn&#39;t taste any bacon flavoring. But the spicy one? WOW! If you like it hot, order one of them. Trust me.Now, the cons:Every flipping time I come and try to enjoy my meal, there&#39;s a family with loud, obnoxious children seated near us. I don&#39;t mind children in a restaurant, but PLEASE- if your child is banging their spoon on the table, for the love of god, take the spoon away. Or the infant that&#39;s screaming at the top of its lungs- I don&#39;t understand why the parents do not take the child outside so patrons are not disturbed. Â I&#39;m spending a good chunk of change on my meal, and I&#39;d like to be able to enjoy my food and dining experience.The restaurant is small, and when it&#39;s crowded, your chair is pretty much touching the person&#39;s behind you (unless you&#39;re lucky enough to be against the wall).The waitstaff isn&#39;t the greatest. They&#39;d best be described at inattentive; you pretty much need to stand up and wave your arms to get their attention. It took 15 minutes for the waitress to refill my water. The second time, the buss boy got to it before the waitress did.They don&#39;t do a very good job at removing plates, cups, etc... anything you&#39;re done with, which is a pain because the tables are small enough to begin with.Regardless of the few annoyances, I will continue to come to HO7, only because it&#39;s one of the best cajun restaurants in the area that I&#39;m familiar with."heaven-on-seven-naperville,Holly R.,tbzgEQkM6IXlku_1wPLtPQ,"Waco, TX",0,1,1,5,59,Hw7kOQFHXZT-mOw77f1Kcw,4,01/04/16,"Our family decided to do a &#34;Taste of Naperville.&#34; We stopped in various restaurants, sampling an appetizer at each.

However that is not the main reason I am upset. The waiter was very nice and customer service oriented, but the manager on duty was down right rude. When she came over and I told her why I couldn&#39;t eat the meal, and she tried to question my knowledge of how seafood should taste. She was very disrespectful to the point to where I did not want to try anything else. If I could give this place a negative 3 stars I would for her service alone. I am more than happy to pay for good food and service, but she was absolutely horrible, and the shrimp was bad. I will say again that the waiter was very nice and professional.

It&#39;s been years since we&#39;ve been to the one downtown, but it wasn&#39;t my birthday so I was going to at least try to eat healthy while there.We walked in and waited.And waited.And waited and waited.Then we waited some more.The funny thing is, only 3 tables in the entire restaurant were taken. But there was only one woman working the entire dining room.A blonde girl ran over to the hostess stand, said hi and walked away. Then she walked back to the hostess stand, told us she wasn&#39;t on the clock and then walked away again.I guess it would&#39;ve been too much to have her ask someone else to seat us?So the manager, a cantankerous fellow, came out, greeted us (sorta) and sat us down without a well wish or a smile. We were obviously keeping him from doing something important.Things got better from that point on. Our server more than made up for the crappy inattentive service we received at the beginning when we felt about as unwelcome as could be.She was friendly, attentive and super nice. Drinks were refilled and brought out without haste. Meals arrived correctly and timely. She was a gem.The food was quite good too. My wife ordered the fried green tomato appetizer. I took a bite and liked it, but limited myself.Then we each had a cup of gumbo, which was amazing. I&#39;d go here again just for that. I&#39;ve been to the real N&#39;awlins and I have to say...I liked this better.Our meals soon followed with her having an oyster/shrimp po&#39;boy and I had the low carb jambalaya, which was a lie because the sauce was super sugary. It&#39;s ok, tho. I&#39;m not counting carbs, just trying to be healthy overall. There was tons of meat (chicken, shrimp and sausage) along with onions, peppers and spices. I didn&#39;t love the sauce it was in. Tasted a little too ketchuppy. Maybe it works better over rice so the rice can absorb some of that sweet sauciness.For dessert Laura got a free order of bread pudding thanks to the Yelp check in offer. It looked and smelled amazing too. Very sweet, huge portion and covered in caramel goodness. I may come back on cheat day for that.So overall, good food, excellent service, and a jerk of a manager.

I AM SO DISAPPOINTED I DIDN&#39;T GO EARLIER! With half my family from Louisiana, it&#39;s a shame I waited this long. For same.I first came here a month ago for brunch. It&#39;s one of the only spots in the suburbs that is not a bar, that serves bloodies and mimosas for brunch. We were not disappointed. Bloody mary&#39;s were spicy, but not to worry, because if they weren&#39;t spicy enough, I had 12 bottles of hot sauce on the table to choose to add. For my meal, I had the Poached Eggs on Crabcakes with Creole Sauce. SO delicious. It was light (unlike the 4-egg omelettes!), but filling, and I just about licked the creole sauce off the plate. Just the right amount of savory, and the homemade crabcakes just flaked apart. Delish.After this, I knew a return was quick to be had. I was so excited to try the gumbo! Now, I&#39;m no stranger to gumbo, and this stuff was incredible. Much thicker, almost gravy-like. I didn&#39;t dislike that style at all, it was still tasty, and had a warm, peppery taste.For dinner I had the tilapia with crab cakes. I wanted to venture out, but the crab cakes were so good before, that I couldn&#39;t pass them up. It was delicious! I didn&#39;t even need the rice. The flavor was incredible.I have to say, I have read numerous reviews about portion sizes here. Either they&#39;ve changed, or ya&#39;ll don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about. After a small cup of gumbo, I had a hard time even finishing half of my meal, and the other came home with me. And I am no light eater.Since I checked in on Yelp, we got a free dessert to split. It would have cost $7, and between three girls, we couldn&#39;t finish half. The chocolate peanut butter pie was so rich, with a wonderful crust.Service is friendly and prompt, and the decor is cozy and very NOLA-themed.

We ordered the food and took over an hour to come out and it wasn&#39;t even busy. Our server didn&#39;t really care and all she said was well I&#39;m sorry with a dirty look on her face and that was it. We then asked to talk to the manager he was in the corner eating and didn&#39;t really want to come over but when he did he didn&#39;t care at all. He SHOULD NOT be a manager (poor at doing so). Then I sent an email to Jimmy Banas brother who told me on the phone to email him and he never got back to me. Also sent a Facebook message and same thing. This place Sucks!

We came here during the lunch buffet, it was a good selection. My wife and I thought the chettinad chicken curry was bomb with just the right amount of spices, definitely more south Indian style. The buffet itself had a good amount of options, and all the dishes were unique in flavor. The foods here definitely lean towards South Indian style.

There was plenty to choose from I&#39;m always glad to see South Indian meat dishes at the buffet. I didn&#39;t even bother to try the usual tandoori chicken or naan because they had quite a large selection of items that you normally don&#39;t see. The chicken vepudu (or varuval or dry masala) was great. The goat curry was very tender. All their chutneys were great but the idly was not the best. the Spinach dal, mushroom chili, the potato fry were all pretty decent. The biryani was not bad either. They even had paya (a goat leg soup which is a delicacy in some parts of southern india). I didn&#39;t care for the Apollo fish. Desserts and boondi was great.Overall, I&#39;m not sure if I should praise or complain but most of the dishes were under salted. Usually I don&#39;t care for salt but it was certainly less even for me. Some items were just the right spice some were less spicy. Despite the selection, I wasn&#39;t too awed by the flavors.Service was friendly and it&#39;s nice to see plenty of other south Indians dining here (always a good sign)."masala-warrenville,Nelson M.,qntQp9UoeP6ju8D_W0Y0cw,"Champaign, IL",1,1,1,206,8,GsZ34Zvurk4QbFcvCVAlzA,3,14/06/16,"Restaurant reviewI agree with SJ Yelp review. I also came here for the first time on Memorial Dayy. One one hand I am happy they were open as they are usually closed, however they of course increase the price for the holidays. Maybe I am not as familiar with north and south food, but some of the tasty dishes such as tikka masala were nowhere to be found. There was your typical salad spread which I did not touch along with chutney. The tandori chicken was a tad on the cooler side and was served on the buffet table. I was concern with the temperature, but I still ate it. The spinach paneer was likely the star of the buffet with ample amounts of cheese. They had a variety of fried indian carb items which were good. The chicken briyani also was on the luke warm side which lessen its appeal. They did have goat curry which is always hearty. Finally the dessert was a huge let down. No mango ice cream. They did not have the traditional rice pudding as well. Instead there was a variety of odd tasting desserts which you can check out in my pictures. Finally it took a long time for the naan to come out. It was not fluffy nor did we can a refill while we ate.Pros: AYCE indian, different items than your typically buffet, free ChaiCons: Higher price than other indian buffet, lukewarm tandori chicken and other dishesHidden deals:Cheaper normally on weekdays than weekend.

Let me just summarize by saying that we had a negative experience with the total check, and the food did not meet our expectations.it was rather a special occasion for me, because not only my wife (kids mom) was with us but also my mom since our parents are visiting from India. We called ahead and made a reservation knowing the place would fill up fast on a day like this. the guy on the phone told us it was $14.99 for the buffet, Â and they did not offer a menu selection for lunch.we got there a few minutes after our reserved time and we only had a short wait, Â they were able to get us a table for 6. Ok, we headed off to the buffet mingling with the crowd. Typical Masala spread, jilebis and what we took to be bondas or vadas, right at the beginning - turned out later they had a sweet filling.But the whole buffet seems very much a bunch of assorted things offered by a management who is confused about their identity. I mean, there are hundreds Â of dishes in Indian Cuisine, Â so pick one region for God sakes, and stick with that theme. Â Given that the management, staff and most of the clientele is typically from the southern (Andhra Pradesh) region, you find some Andhra style food on buffet menu. I would have liked to see a few spicy vegetable dishes in keeping with this theme. instead, they had one karela dish, and thats it. The other selections were mushy Pongal, Â &#34;papdi chat&#34; (bland), pav bhaji (bland), dal, sambar and rasam, and Chinese noodles and fried rice. Seriously guys ?! I think they were just focused on getting as many Indians to come in for Mother&#39;s day as possible and therefore went with a &#34;something for everyone&#34; plan.Don&#39;t expect anything from Andhra chef trying his hand at papdi chat or pav bhaji. Pongal, sambar and rasam- all can be had at Aurora temple, much better for fraction of the price. They had something they called &#34;mysore bonda&#34;, well my family is from Bangalore / Mysore , this is nothing like it. Two words- potato filling, Â not unspiced dough balls. Tip for the cooks, go to any Gujarati joint and try their bataka vadas.Dessert was disappointing too- where was the mango ice cream or at least jamuns? they ran out of cake (not kidding) and brought out some goop calling it custard, Â it wasn&#39;t even sweet.Now the final blow. 4 adults and 2 kids , the lady rang us up $110!!! Here is her story-the buffet is $16.99 not $14.99 as we were originally told (so we were misled). Mothers Day- just use any excuse to overcharge for your same food knowing that Indian Moms will come trooping in.......taxes... looks waaay more that 8.5%SERVICE Charge of $15 since we were 5 and above in our party. Seriously?! for what, clearing our plates and refilling a water jug? it&#39;s self service buffet for crying out loud!She told me that any restaurant would be doing this, including American restaurants. Ha, I differ... it&#39;s EIGHT or more not five.overall, unsatisfactory experience and unpleasant check shock. I&#39;m giving out 3 stars only because we were seated relatively quickly.

I loved the plain paper thin dosa it was met for sharing lol. Â It was way bigger than the plate. The gulab jamun reminded me of the spongy meatball soaked in floral sweetness.

Their gobi manchurian is to die for. Their buffet spread is large and good, provided you get there early or else you are just left with scraps or just the gravy.

The consistency is excellent and the flavors are very tempting. The tandoori items are ok and come with naan bread. They also have a typical Andhra entrees (like vankaya koora i.e. egg plant curry). The dal, rasam and sambar have been acceptable. I am a vegetarian, so do not have any views on the other section of the buffet table.When we go for dinners, they serve a la carte.

The chinese fried rice was tasty. We have also tried the rocket dosa here a few times.. The last time we tried it the chutney was also fresh.

However, within minutes of presenting the food, our server approached us and inquired about the spice level. Before I could even request more spice, he offered to spike either of our meals if they weren&#39;t at the right heat level. I was impressed!

Buffet is just OK. For a restaurant that believes it is upscale with the prices they charge they use tactics found on the street. Overdoing food coloring on almost everything. Most of the food is reheated from the morning or previously frozen.The lighting is low to imitate the perception of a fancy restaurant however it&#39;s so low that even reading the menu is a pain.I ordered 2 separate items which have different ways of cooking them from scratch but made with almost the same ingredients.

This has some pretty good decor, they used the Bar also as an extended restaurant, which I thought was good use of the space, eveything was laid out in an informal way. The lunch buffet had limited options but was pretty good. In the vegetarian side - the Gobi Manchurian and Paneer Butter masala, both were really good. Couple of nice south indian breakfast items - pongal, vada, uthappam, idly, we had a little bit of a confusion as to where the chutney&#39;s where. The non-vegetarian had good options in terms of variety, but the two standouts for me were the fish curry (kerala) and the Keema Fry. Lot of sweets - jalebi, laddu, payasam.The funny thing here is - I think when they ran out of a particular dish - especially for the sweets, they made something utterly new. Like there was Kesari written on the placard, but Carrot Halwa was served, similarly Dhahi Papdi Chaat was written, but just boiled channa (chickpeas) was served. But, I felt paying a bill of $133 ~ $22 per person for the lunch, was not worth it. It&#39;s probably like $5 more expensive than it should be.

I tried to avoid this area around lunchtime (seriously, have you ever tried to make a left to get back out onto Diehl road?!) but after attempting lunch at another Indian place that isn&#39;t open for business yet, I decided Masala would do.Upon entering, I was greated warmed and the man asked me &#34;two?&#34; Seeing as how I walked in alone, (unless I have a ghost following me) I shook my head and told him I&#39;d like to order something to go. He said that wasn&#39;t a problem and handed me a menu. Nice guy, though. Since I didn&#39;t learn his name, I&#39;ll just call him Bob.Looking around, this place looked pretty fancypants. There are chandeliers, and theres an on-site banquet facility as well. The main dining area wasn&#39;t overly bright, but you didn&#39;t need a lantern to eat your food, either. The place had a good, cozy ambiance.The menu was quite large and impressive. It seemed as though there was a little bit of everything under the sun. I decided on the Chicken Tikka Masala (I&#39;ve really grown to like this dish). I would have gotten a bottle of water, but they did not have any. As I placed my order, Bob tried to get me to try the AYCE lunch buffet not once, but twice because it&#39;s cheaper. Listen, I get it buddy; I&#39;d LOVE to spend $12 and stuff myself full of meats, salads, and naan. But I have an hour for lunch. I had already used up a quarter of that getting here; I&#39;d be lucky to get back in time to sample my lunch before my 1:00 p.m. meeting. Loved his salesman tactics, though. I should have asked if he&#39;d like to sell cars at my bf&#39;s work.After placing my order and paying ($14 plus $1 tip), I waited about five minutes for my order. As another employee handed it to me, Bob told me that he gave me a side of the bread, even though it wasn&#39;t included with my original order. Awesome! Unexpected naan is the best! I thanked him and headed out.I won&#39;t get into the horrors of attempting to return to work- let&#39;s fast forward to the food. I open my containers and see a good sized portion of Chicken Tikka Masala. The sauce was fragrant, the chicken was delicious all-white meat and tender, and the rice (in a separate container on the side) was good. A bit bland, but once it was mixed into the chicken, it tasted just fine. The naan was soft and warm, and was a great dunking vessel for the CTM.I&#39;ll definitely go back again, but not for lunch.

The buffet presents several meat selections, while remaining completely vegetarian friendly ( which is a concern for us personally). Plenty of gluten free options too if you fly that way. On our last visit we ordered off the menu for the first time. The Mirchi Bajji ( deep fried green chilis in chick pea batter) were amazing ( yes, spicy) &amp; the coconut chutney &amp; Mango lassi are always perfect. Â The Paneer Tikka Masala was excellent.

I am very skeptical of the Indian and Chinese and Thai restaurants because they have been extremely successful in disappointing me with their food. Not that they had unhygienic produce or disgruntled owners/waitresses, but they lacked the perfection that a particular cuisine demands. I say this because I&#39;ve had some really authentic food so those just didn&#39;t match up.I have been to quite a few Indian restaurants in Rochester, NYC, Philly and its suburbs (because I live here) and none of them impressed me with the mind boggling flavor and aroma - the one which makes you drool. Literally.A few weeks ago, I was in Chicago for a vacation. So my good old friend, who lives in Lisle, suggested me this place one evening. Went there, was pretty late so I ordered 2 portions of Hyderabadi Dum Biryani and 2 portions of Andhra Chicken Fry. Each of those items were just exquisite in their own world - looked perfect, tasted even perfect. The spices on the Chicken Fry was not extremely rough but it did exude a gentle peppery flavor. The Biryani, however, blew everything out of the water. The chicken was marinated at just the right amount and the rice was very good - non-sticky and had some unusual flavor to it which made me wanted to eat it over and over again. Since the food was so good, I complemented it with my Dewars 15 Years scotch:)I woke up the next morning with a Chicken Biryani hangover and I suggested a couple of my friends for the Lunch Buffet at Masala. I was pleasantly surprised when I found that their buffet menu had equally good food as their Ã  la carte. The salads, chicken gravy, paneer masala (cottage cheese), the exceptional dal (lentils) and even the table-served chicken tandoori kebabs had just the right amount of taste which made me write this review.This was a really good experience! I just can&#39;t wait to go to Chicago again to try out their other dishes.

The restaurant was very dirty - the tablecloths were still stained with drips of sauce, leading me to feel like they don&#39;t wash them often. Everywhere we walked our shoes stuck to the floor. What was worst was that the buffet where the food was served was very dirty. The galub jamun had things floating in the syrup... things that shouldn&#39;t be floating in there. Additionally, the food wasn&#39;t good this time. I am vegetarian and there weren&#39;t many options for me - I had a serving of palak paneer, and when I went back for more they had put out another batch, and it didn&#39;t taste the same as the first. They&#39;re not consistent. My fiance tried the different meats and complained that they left many small bones in the meat that you could not notice until you had already put the food in your mouth and were chewing.

We ordered a whole bunch of food and the waiter told us it was a lot but we love the leftovers. My son had the butter chicken and he said he could eat that every night.

Â Our table stuck with dishes from the North Indian menu.Dinner started with a couple of orders of papadum with tasty coriander and sweet tamarind chutney. Â  We quickly realized dishes at Masala tend to be spicy. Â A couple in our party requested their food be prepared mild and the kitchen was happy to oblige.Indian beer is quite good and our table ordered Kingfisher and Taj Mahal. Â I stuck with water as the restaurant doesn&#39;t really have a wine list. Â My typical preference is to pair Indian food with viognier, dry riesling, or torrontes.Getting decent service at Indian restaurants can be an issue but the folks at Masala were affable.We ordered Pakoras and Samosas for appetizers. Â For dinner we ordered Chicken Tandoori, Chicken Tikka, Mutter Paneer, and Aloo Gobhi. Â The dinner accompany&#39;s included garlic naan, onion kulcha, and couple of orders of raita to wash it down.Our dishes mostly lacked flavor. Â The pakoras were tasty and spicy but were an unusual mixture of onions and chillies and maybe spinach strips. Â Whatever happened to hardy potato and cauliflower pakoras? Â We were disappointed at how bland the tandoor cooked Chicken Tikka was. Â The Aloo Gobhi was spicy but lacking much flavor and also greasy. Â  The Mutter Paneer was prepared mild upon request but I&#39;ve had better. Â The best part of dinner was the flaky and hot bread.

If you&#39;ve never had this south Indian breakfast item give it a try here. However that is where the quality ends. The butter chicken was horrible. They use way too much food coloring in it. Flavor was bland and not authentic. I&#39;m not sure what cut of chicken they used in it but I doubt it was tandoori chicken legs like the recipe calls for. I feel bad when people not familiar with real Indian food eat this stuff as it is misleading and causes them to dislike it based on bad items like this. Biryani was also poorly made. Too much mint and fenugreek flavors overtake the dish. Also too much food coloring again. If you want a great biryani go to Cumin restaurant in Chicago. If you want a great butter chicken the best I&#39;ve had was in India and I&#39;m still searching for a good one in the states.

First and foremost I have visited this restaurant many times and I have not encountered any issues regards food or service. They do get very busy at times so I can understand that you are not waited on hand in foot which yes if you go to dinner at 7pm on a Saturday you might not be attended to all your needs whenever you snap your fingers. This place is amazing some of the best Indian food that I have had (better than my moms, but don&#39;t tell her)The restaurant ambiance is incredible, you feel that you are eating at a place that is clean and can appreciate the upkeep. I have eaten here on multiple occasions include the buffet and dinner service. I have pretty much tasted a large amount of the menu. I can say that for appetizers the Pakoras, Chicken Tikka, and Paneer are outstanding. For dinner the Dal Makhani and the Paneer Tikka my parents loved the kadai paneer and bhendi masala. Know to something I cannot describe but you have to go in and try yourself, are the chicken and lamb dishes. These are above and beyond my expectations and what keeps me coming back to this restaurant. Also they have a Dosa bar which is incredible and make fresh naan, because you can physically see someone making it.Overall I can say that this place is a great experience to bring you and your family. I know some Indian families are limited on what they eat, but this place has ample choices that can fit any need. I needed to write this review because I actually believe that people have bad intentions and sometimes inaccurately portray someone&#39;s potential livelihood.

Since you need a $20 minimum for delivery, I threw in an order of Spicy fries (w/a side of hot sauce, too) and a 24 oz bottle of Sierra Mist (I don&#39;t drink pop anymore, but I needed something to tip the scales over $20).Satisfied, I submitted my order. It was 5:13 p.m. They estimated my delivery time for about an hour (&#34;6:14-ish&#34;, said Grubhub). Low and behold, my doorbell rang at 5:45, and I was shocked. I honestly was expecting the hour they said (Route 59 construction + rush hour traffice= nightmare). The delivery guy even charged up the stairs like a bull to get me my food. Talk about enthusiasm! He was extremely friendly too; repeated my entire order back to make sure it was correct, which it was (right down to the extra hot sauces, and no silverware needed). Alas, it was time to eat.The Spicy Fries looked and smelled good. After tasting one, I was totally surprised. I can handle spicy food like no one&#39;s business, but my god!

The person I spoke to on the phone was also super friendly and patient and when I went to pick up the pizza, he remembered who I was from the phone call and nicely smiled at me and was very friendly.I will definitely order from here again next time I&#39;m craving pizza! I want to try pan or whatever other styles they offer."adamos-pizza-and-catering-naperville,Eric T.,noq73LiteMK0rklzGt-R-Q,"Neenah, WI",0,1,0,1,11,zzBVOdf7sKdws0mVXfMAMQ,4,16/09/15,Ordered carry out over phone.

My absolute favorite pizza is the Florentine. The calzones are delicious too. I work close by and will oftentimes order lunch from Adamo&#39;s as well. The Godmother sandwich and the chicken Caesar salad are both solid choices.Having been to Adamo&#39;s as many times as I have, I can say that I have always received top-notch service.

I ordered the thin crust sausage pizza and LOVED it! Don&#39;t understand why people might have called the sauce tasteless. Just a hint of sweetness to balance the delicious saltiness of the cheese! Real mozzarella cheese, too, more reminiscent of giordano&#39;s than the lesser quality stuff used at say domino&#39;s or papa john&#39;s. Tried the cheese bread, and it was just ok (maybe would be better piping hot at the restaurant?) same with mozz sticks. The cannoli was delicious!!!Most importantly, the price was great, and it got to our house in about 30 minutes!I think this will be my new go-to pizza place from now on! (At least until Jan 1st when I swear off all carbs, cheese, sugar and anything yummy in general :)Note: this review would have been 5 stars just for the pizza (and the cannoli!) but brought down to 4 with the mediocre cheese bread and mozz sticks."adamos-pizza-and-catering-naperville,Marvin W.,fcsrvkpwkH8t8ZFXFoiUFw,"Naperville, IL",0,1,0,1,18,2DUVlteN19X-FQAHizguig,4,22/12/11,"In all honesty. This is the worse pizza I&#39;ve ever had anywhere in the country. Worse than cities that don&#39;t even claim to have a good pizza! Worse than all of the commercialized pizza chains! Surely the kind of stuff you&#39;d find at a 4 year old kid&#39;s pizza party.I&#39;m only writing this as constructive criticism and in hopes that Adamo&#39;s considers stepping up their game. After moving just a few blocks away from Adamo&#39;s 7 months ago, I finally broke down and tried it. From being in the restaurant industry as a chef, exec manager, corp manager and consultant for 27 years, I have the talent of gauging most restaurants accurately, and this is why I stayed away from this place.I ordered a large pizza and 6 wings. The only thing that I finished and kept was the free Pepsi. That Pepsi was GREAT! I can tell that they are using the lowest quality of ingredients probably purchased from Restaurant Depot (the Aldi for the restaurant industry.)The dough was over proofed and gummy, the sauce was like a glorified ketchup and seemed to be straight from the can; the cheese seemed to be a part skim blend and wasn&#39;t fully melted. The wings were breaded and anorexic, and the ranch dressing was surely a very low grade. The marinara that came with the free garlic bread was right out of the can and tasted like tomato paste with water added to it and maybe...a few spices.I&#39;m usually right about places like this, but I Â still ordered and was in a great mood and had no expectations and realized afterwards that I should&#39;ve gone with my first impression. I do have to say that the delivery guy was very nice and thankful; the website was very easy to use and convenient for ordering. But the product is by far VERY poor.As a consultant, I see why they have been in business since 1988, it&#39;s not because they have an outstanding product. It&#39;s because they are located on a very busy street, near more than a dozen apartment complexes populated with individuals that range mostly in their 20&#39;s. There&#39;s no competition for them for quite a few miles. So, they really don&#39;t have to change anything, right? The 20 year old crowd will continue to support Adamo&#39;s inferior products because it&#39;s convenient and they probably just don&#39;t care!You heard it here first! As soon as another Pizza restaurant hits this area, Adamo&#39;s will be done if they don&#39;t change! I&#39;ve seen it happen over and over and over in the restaurant industry. Take this review as a free consultation Adamo&#39;s and please don&#39;t be angered by it. You won&#39;t be able to keep operating the way that you have been. You&#39;re running on borrowed time.

Staying in on a Friday night decided chicken and waffles sounded good. Â Arrived at 6:00 pm and there were 4 or 5 tables with people sitting and one person in line ahead of me. With only two people working, they were vastly understaffed and unprepared for A Friday night. Â It took over 50 minutes to get my simple two person take out order. When I arrived home, the order was partially wrong. As for the food, the Chicken had a good flavor, the waffle wasn&#39;t bad but was cold and slightly burned. Also tried the fried pickles which were undercooked. Â I attributed all the problems to needing time to works out the kinks.Update: Â went back after about three weeks. This time on a Sunday night at 5:30. I asked how long it would take and was told 15-20 minutes. My order finally came out after 45 minutes, and was again wrong.

So when I walk into this place and the entire middle eastern population of Lombard (20 people) are dining here you know it&#39;s a good sign.As a minor league foodie this place was a find. The lunch combo with a drink costs around $8 and trust me when I tell you that every bite was great. The chicken was marinated perfectly in my number one Shwarma combo and the steak charred to perfection. The rice was even burstin with flavor and the salad... Well it was average but tasty.The reason for the four stars is entirely atmosphere. The booths are standard but need updating and the decorations are okay. Their credit card machine was on the fritz too. But my biggest beef was the heat. I understand it was hot outside but you&#39;ve got to compensate. That and there was absolutely no music at all so I ended up listening to this guy doing a sales pitch for the whole hour. And the fake coconut tree... I&#39;ll just leave it at that. Lol.Regardless- you guys!!! Your product is incredible and pricing is on point. Get the atmosphere together and you will wipe the floor with pita inn down the road.

The beef and kebab was delicious, the chicken was a VERY bland. One thing I don&#39;t like is, they don&#39;t have water.

She did the right thing- offered to remake dish until we were happy.2nd shawarma came out- this time it was clearly heated on grill with oil/sauce. Like magic- totally different dish. Much better.So- food, inconsistent. But made effort to remedy.Atmosphere- poor.

Convenient location on Roosevelt, if you&#39;re headed west. Not sure how this is to get out of if you need to cross all the lanes during the lunch rush. ;)When I walked in, the place was noticeably different! The music, the Arabic programming on TV, Hijab on the women at the counter, and many Arab speakers. For a suburban guy, this was actually very refreshing! I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect, and took some time to read the menu.I ordered the Arabian Shawarma, which is basically a combo. I asked for beef, she said chicken, I corrected her and still got the chicken. I would take 1/2 star off for this, but she was so friendly and attentive, and I was wavering, anyway.The food is where this place shines! This was some of the best chicken shawarma I&#39;ve had. I might want more sauce options, but what was there all tasted hot and fresh. The side was french fries (from what I&#39;ve heard, a staple in Arab countries, anyway), but they were perfect! The can of soda included came from a cooler with a decent assortment of beverages.The incense burning covered an odor from the bathroom, which could be another 1/2 star, but it wasn&#39;t terrible and the incense were actually very nice.That I was the only non-Arab speaker in the restaurant, with 8+ guests, was a big indicator that these folks know what they&#39;re doing when it comes to authentic flavors.

Why didn&#39;t she ask for help in the first place?!?!Then the lady asked me how much the atm charged me, so I told her thinking maybe she was going to comp me something or replace it. Why else would she ask? She shrugged and said, that&#39;s not bad! It&#39;s not bad but there was no reason for me to have to do it in the first place if she had just asked her coworker or boss how to work the credit card machine.I then wait over 20 minutes for my to go order and when I finally get it she says &#34;we will no longer be able to sub rice for fries next time&#34;.

I made a note to visit when they eventually opened. This evening, while driving by I saw an open sign and people inside so I decided to give it a try.I got in line while someone else ordered and waited for a few minutes to place my order as well. Once I had ordered I sat down and began the process of adding the business to Yelp gathering information off of the menu and business card. My order took quite a while to be ready (a little over 20 minutes) but my food was then brought out and it was time to dine. I ordered a Beef Shwarma sandwich and a bottle of water.The sandwich came wrapped up in a roll kind of like a burrito. There were grill marks visible on the bottom and it held together quite well. I took a bite and was immediately overwhelmed by a whole lot of different than I&#39;m accustom to flavors. The beef shwarma meat was tender and moist. There were lots of middle eastern spices which I can&#39;t identify giving it both a sweet and spicy combination that perfectly complimented one another. Tomato slices and onions were mixed in which gave it a little extra body. I&#39;d also say the sandwich was at least double the size I expected to be. Simply put I was very impressed as the overall combination of flavors created a decadent masterpiece of a sandwich.As I was eating and leaving I overheard that there would be an hour wait on Shwarma as they had run out, growing pains with a new business I guess. Assuming that they have food ready this place is definitely worth trying. Hopefully they&#39;ll maintain the quality (and quantity) of food I experienced as time goes on. Despite the name express (you&#39;d think it wouldn&#39;t take 20 minutes to have a sandwich ready), the Shwarma here was definitely fantastic. I&#39;m going to give this place a whopping five stars and say that this Shwarma did me no harma. This was an absolutely fantastic sandwich and I will surely be back again."shawarma-express-lombard,K B.,8PJgQpAcFC0zNtNpsl7Rgg,"Chicago, IL",0,1,0,3,57,fs1MyIcIzby11dsMR2MPEQ,5,28/02/16,"Average to say the least, but I was born in Dearborn, Michigan and I know superior Middle Eastern food.

Apart from those 2 I&#39;m not so much happy with the shawarma which is a bit undercooked for my taste.

We ordered a Chicken Shawarma and a Beef Shawarma. My Beef Shawarma was good, the flavor and spices were their and so was the small amount of beef.Chicken Shawarma was filled with rubbery thin pieces of chicken and not much flavor, also the Shawarma&#39;s had a garlic thick sauce that was awesome.The place was clean and I notice one customer that was waiting for a long time for his order and he was growing inpatient, he walk a couple times to the gentleman behind the counter and the reason for that, there were no waitress on the clock.My wife stated she won&#39;t be back.

This place has really stepped it up since they opened. The first couple times I tried their food I thought it was kind of &#34;meh,&#34; but after a couple months of hiatus I gave it another go... and boy am I glad I did!I did find two rather long hairs in my baba ghanouj, but it&#39;s not really a big deal and I suppose mistakes happen. I mean, there are a lot of things you could find in your food that are worse than hair, and no one can really control when a hair decides to detach itself from their head... Anyway, the food was good!The interior is nice: clean, well-lit, well-decorated. It&#39;s one step up from any privately owned fast food joint you&#39;ll visit in the Chicago suburbs. We&#39;ve never dined in here - we always order carry-out - but we wouldn&#39;t feel uncomfortable eating here other than the fact that it can be pretty empty sometimes. If you go in during rush hour you&#39;ll find a lot of shirt-and-tie types swinging in for a bite to eat after work. It&#39;s good to know other people appreciate Shawarma Express too.The falafel is well-spiced and has a great crunch to it. It wasn&#39;t overly dry and didn&#39;t go soggy on the drive home, either.The hummus is good - it&#39;s hard to go wrong with basic hummus.For me, it&#39;s all about the baba ghanouj. The baba here has an awesome smoky flavor and is served up a little chunky (which I love), with some fresh herbs and spices sprinkled over the top. If you want to cut back on the fat ask them for &#34;no oil&#34; on the hummus and baba - they&#39;ll be perfectly accommodating and leave it off for you.Their tabbouleh tastes fresh and isn&#39;t mostly bulgur like at some places. It&#39;s got a lot of parsley and lemon juice, and isn&#39;t overly minty either. I&#39;m not a big fan of strong mint flavor.The foul (pronounced &#34;fool&#34;) is what we really go here for. Shawarma Express is one of the only places we&#39;ve ever found in the area that&#39;s got it. It&#39;s a mashed broad bean (fava bean) dish cooked with cumin and big chunks of garlic, and served up in a pool of lemon juice and olive oil. YUM! This stuff is GOOD, especially when eaten with their pita bread (which is also good).This place is a great choice if you&#39;re looking for some Middle Eastern flair on your taste buds, but don&#39;t want to wait for anything more than fast food. Shawarma Express has been a go-to for us many times, and will continue to be!"shawarma-express-lombard,Umar H.,xgZ82tfiRHgvRQw3UGyYJA,"Westmont, IL",0,1,0,0,33,ubHMWycQQKj3rbClfK87Vg,4,17/01/15,Amazing food!

Decided to try Shawarma express one day, at it was not good all. The chicken sharwama was bland, only chicken and slightly mayo in a tortilla wrap. The beef sharwama was bad also, All my bites were beef fat, and not chewable. For real, I still think Naf Naf &amp; Pita BBQ are wayyyy better then this.

Unfortunately, not under the current ownership! These owners have no clue how to run a business, so they hired an East coast chef and gave him full reign over the menu. But let&#39;s rewind first.....The building is a former motel/crack-house with a successful bar on the lower lever. To no ones surprise, the motel went up in flames, badly damaging the bar with it. Hence the name &#34;Embers&#34;, as if it rose from the ashes or something.They did a great job of reconstructing the building, utilizing all three levels and adding a small deck off the back, which overlooks an alley with a tangled mess of power lines and a set of train tracks. This is by no means a &#34;roof top patio&#34; as their website claims. The 2nd floor has an additional full bar, a pool table &amp; enough space to do just about anything... but they don&#39;t do anything with it. If they had bands &amp; DJ&#39;s every weekend, this place would be &#34;THE PLACE&#34; in downtown Lockport. It&#39;s almost as if the owners don&#39;t want customers at all, so the top levels remain mostly unused, which is a total shame.Their menu is their biggest downfall though. Let&#39;s start off with their burger menu since that&#39;s apparently what they&#39;re known for. First off..... Why on earth would anyone need a burger menu of preset burgers? Why can&#39;t you just say, &#34;We make burgers. Here&#39;s the list of add-ons&#34; Done!Nope..... their chef Â has to create all these culinary disasters served on those awful pretzel buns and topped off with stupid things like vanilla bean BBQ sauce, &#34;Embers Sauce&#34; and &#34;Secret Sauce&#34;!Wait, WHAT???What the hell is &#34;Embers Sauce&#34; and &#34;Secret Sauce&#34;? I&#39;m not eating anything that you can&#39;t even tell me what&#39;s in it. When will chef&#39;s get a clue that if I want any type of sauce on my burger, I&#39;ll add it on myself and by the way it&#39;s called ketchup, mustard or A-1 steak sauce.Oh, and their menu says, &#34;Our burgers are cooked medium-well &amp; are juicy, no need to request a temperature&#34;. Yet another way the let the chef make his own rules.As for the rest of the menu, you can expect each and every entrÃ©e to be toped off with something that doesn&#39;t belong on it, such as mushroom gravy, dijon aioli and grain mustard.As for the service.....It&#39;s as bad as the rest of the reviews say. We overheard our server have to re-ask a table next to us what they ordered because, as she explained to them, &#34;Last night was my birthday and I&#39;m still a little hungover.&#34; So my girlfriend knew right away that she was going to screw up our order. I ordered the Classic burger without the mystery &#34;Embers Sauce&#34; and my girlfriend ordered the Breakfast Burger. Just as my girlfriend predicted, she gave us both the Classic Burger &amp; blamed it on the kitchen, even though she didn&#39;t write our order down at all. Fifteen minutes later her Breakfast Burger arrives.I&#39;m not a beer snob, so I&#39;m not going to give a review on that but I do know that $4 for a 16oz can of PBR is way overpriced.Do the owners a favor and let them know what you think of this place. Maybe they&#39;ll fire the chef and just stick to good old American food without the fancy crap.For now, if you want a good burger..... go to Burger King."embers-tap-house-lockport,Jayson A.,BAMhUvtmdrRnujzlGZyACQ,"Lockport, IL",0,1,0,2,4,ovH0P6lMrjfPI1BXOBwjZw,1,27/05/16,"Having grown up in Lockport all of my life, Embers Tap House was exactly what this town needed as a bit of a pick-me-up.The building once housed Apartments but they burned down several years ago and the building sat vacant for many years. I went to Embers when they opened but could not be seated due to the overcrowded mess that was going on inside. When I finally got around to visiting again, I must say that the food was very well made but the service was lackluster. It seemed as though some servers have their favorites at certain tables and would pay more attention to them instead of keeping a good balance with other customers.In my opinion for the amount of food you receive, the prices are too high. I feel as though every single thing on the menu should be lowered by at least $3 in order to be compliant with the portion size. Don&#39;t get me wrong it is definitely a cool place to check out and eat at, but only maybe once in awhile."embers-tap-house-lockport,Allison A.,JqNsPdZoY2loAUHP3fEwjA,"Homer Glen, IL",0,1,0,86,1,AIlgQet_CBgnoyYnuQj5WQ,3,29/08/16,"This place has SOOOO much potential , seriously !

But the service really leaves something to be desired. We went yesterday to grab a quick drink and an appetizer. We ordered two beers and their nacho appetizer. It took 45 minutes to receive the appetizer. While we were waiting the bar staff could tell we were getting upset and the manager came over and said &#34;Welcome to Ember&#39;s where the food takes a minute&#34;. Now I really don&#39;t think that is something the manager should be saying to the customer, even if it&#39;s the truth.Also, one of the draft lines was extremely flat and I asked for another beer. It was a $9 beer. The bartender kept it on my tab until I asked about it, which took about ten minutes because the bartenders are never looking up at the people at the bar.The place needs better service all around and bartenders that pay more attention to the patrons.

Â Wait staff is painfully slow. Â Food is mediocre.Could be a really cool place to hang but not worth the slow service with attitude. Â Unfortunate.Edit: Â Gotta give props to the management. Â Quick to find and talk with us. Â Definitely care about how the place is run. Â Pulled pork was really good, burger not so much in my opinion. Â Bumped up to 3 stars because management cares and is putting in the effort."embers-tap-house-lockport,Mike M.,QOhemoaGV8UqiofVPj0U6g,"Lockport, IL",0,1,0,0,42,gYVJ_AjwGQAdMVkZ7t1DTA,3,28/06/15,"This place just opened. Service isn&#39;t there yet, but they are polite. They over serve their customers. Â As I write this sitting next to my 9 year old son, a drunk at the bar is dropping the F-bomb every other word as he espouses his political views. Btw, it&#39;s a Â Sunday @ 6pm.Currently a limited menu, but what I had was tasty, albeit a bit overpriced for what it was. Â Currently, it&#39;s just bar food but I&#39;ve heard they plan to expand the menu.The decor is welcoming, but the music is a bit loud (it&#39;s possible we were just under a speaker). Loud music generally makes people talk louder, hence the profane drunk at the bar."embers-tap-house-lockport,Todd G.,FVerkSdPu4iCAQ7PS-FZNQ,"Crystal Lake, IL",0,1,1,11,65,Rw8t-KfHeTGW6zF2vg_P3w,3,07/09/15,"We stopped in for Â lunch at Ember&#39;s after seeing some positive reviews on Yelp. Walking in I have to say its a pretty cool setup. They have a great bar and the just a nice warm vibe to the restaurant just walking in.We didn&#39;t go to deep on the menu as far as eating but being that we are vegatarian i have to say they had some great options. But had to give it a start with the Bavarian Pretzels ... I would recommend them simple but fresh and so good.They have a great beer list of tap and bottled that consist of many great options.For my lunch I had the Falafel sandwich was so tasty. I would highly recommend it and the sweet potato fries that came as the side were amazing.Everyone in our party enjoyed the food they had (burgers, Falafel&#39;s and salad). Â I would definitely come back and have to say was not expecting a great spot like Ember&#39;s Tap House.Cheers to a job well done!"
