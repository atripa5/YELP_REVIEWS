It&#39;s close to my work, so whenever we&#39;re looking for a lunch spot, Chuck&#39;s usually wins out. I&#39;ve tried a couple of different items but everything has been good. Most times when a place has a diverse menu, they don&#39;t do a good job because there&#39;s no focus. Chuck&#39;s isn&#39;t like that! I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a bad thing on the menu. I recommend the po&#39;boy or one of the salads. Chuck has his own garden, so a lot of the veggies are locally grown and fresh. 

The service is usually really tentative even though it gets busy. The servers are always happy to make recommendations or walk you through the menu which I appreciate."

I really do wish I could give them a better review but I can&#39;t. Overall, their BBQ is &#34;famous&#34; because, well, they&#39;re the only BBQ place around being that Darien isn&#39;t exactly (ok or even close) to the BBQ capital of the world. 

Inside and out this place is confusing. Is it an old VFW hall? A former funeral home? Obviously they&#39;re just as confused since they call themselves a &#34;Mexican, Barbecue, Southern&#34; restaurant. More like none of the above. Their breakfast is great I&#39;ll give them that. If you&#39;re not here for breakfast well I&#39;d suggest taking your money and appetite elsewhere. 

As for lunch, dinner, and their so called &#34;late night menu&#34; everything I&#39;ve tried is bland and boring to those who don&#39;t live within a three mile radius of this place. My most memorable experience here was when I ordered from their &#34;late night&#34; menu (it was 10:15pm that&#39;s hardly late night but whatever) and I ordered the wings. The wings come with celery, which I can&#39;t stand, so I asked if I could have some carrots instead. Our waiter did the best he could so no offense to him BUT THE KITCHEN DIDN&#39;T HAVE CARROTS! How does a kitchen that specializes in not one, not two, but three cuisines fail to have carrots? Especially when they&#39;re supposed to be in your salads! I think that sums up their culinary skills in a nutshell. 

Lastly, be careful when it comes to the popcorn machine during football season. It&#39;s germ city and the employees could care less!"

I had the rib combo, having tips as my second part of the combo. Average at best, a bit dry and chewy on the ribs, they were also barely warm... Not very appetizing.
I went with the Mac and Cheese and baked beans as my sides, Nothing special with either of them. 

We both had the chicken and rice soup, which was delicious but the food came out so fast, within minutes of getting the soup I didn&#39;t get a chance to finish it. 

Service was great, but it wasn&#39;t enough to sway my thoughts. Probably won&#39;t be back for quite a while."

The restaurant also boasts an extensive beer list. Many beers on tap are brewed locally. For example, they have beers from Miskatonic, Buckledown, Pollyanna, Lagunitas, and Revolution to name a few. 

My past few dining experiences at Chuck&#39;s have been positive. My go-to entree is the pulled chicken sandwich. It is always tender; you could basically eat it without teeth. A while back, Chuck&#39;s had a fried mac and cheese appetizer, which was outstanding. It came in the form of big fried balls. For some reason, this is no longer on the menu. I would really like to see the fried mac and cheese return. Uncle Bub&#39;s, a BBQ restaurant in Westmont similar to Chuck&#39;s, has the fried mac and cheese balls and they are a favorite of mine. When I had Chuck&#39;s fried mac and cheese, I found it considerably better than Uncle Bub&#39;s. So I recommend bringing it back. 

The dining area is spacious and classy. There is plenty of seating, from booths to tables to the bar. They also have a nice electronic board that updates the beers on tap. This is situated in the dining room. On the walls are logos from breweries, including many that are local.  

In sum, if you are searching for some good BBQ and you enjoy craft beer, check out Chuck&#39;s Southern Comforts Cafe."

Listen, people, I&#39;m a recovering food addict (no joke, I&#39;ve lost over 110lbs), so I&#39;ve eaten A LOT of barbeque in my days. This ex porker knows her food; I know a good ole&#39; B.B.Q. joint when I see one. 

This place makes my heart happy, my tummy full, and my taste buds yearning for more every time I go.  My top two recommendations are - 1. pulled pork (perfection) 2. ribs (bae) MUST. get the combo too and try both; no one&#39;s judging. I personally didn&#39;t care for the brisket but I don&#39;t think brisket is my thing, tbh. I&#39;ve never liked it that much. :( Amateur move, I know. 

As for the sides - 1. Mashed potatoes 2. Mac N Cheese 3. Coleslaw. I&#39;d skip the green beans if you don&#39;t like spicy food - they have quite the kick! but when I read they were made with bacon I had to try them out. Nah. I&#39;ll be skipping these next time. 

As an added bonus, they have an EXTENSIVE beer list, cocktail specials on Thursdays, and a patio that is insanely spacious to accommodate all the people looking to get their arteries clogged like me, yay! Ha. 

Just go! Do it. Andale. Vaya. You won&#39;t regret it."

The food was good but everything else was terrible. I had a reservation for 1:00pm. I waited at the hostess podium for 10 min before anyone would speak with me. There were three women at the podium t talking to each other and just staring at the computer screen and not doing a damn thing. Finally 10 min later and watching people arrive after me getting seated before me a man motion to my group that are table was ready. this man barely made eye contact with my group and I. We were not even sure he meant us. Arriving at our table we saw several tables near by with no one at them. So why the hell did it take so long. this is my worst experience with hostesses ever!!!

We were given a generous amount of drink tickets, good for sample pours of beer from local breweries (Goose Island, Urban Legend, Ten Ninety, Church Street, Buckle Down, Gordon Biersch, Exit Strategy, Lagunitas, and more!) and wine from Cooper&#39;s Hawk.  This event was a beer snob&#39;s paradise.  My favorite beer of the night was the Apricot Ale from Ten Ninety Brewing, located in Glenview.  I also used a lot of my tickets on the Sparkling Almond Wine from Cooper&#39;s Hawk.

A generous amount of food was served buffet-style by Chuck&#39;s including pulled pork sliders, chicken tenders (spicy and Korean style), two soups (corn chowder and a green chile soup), and staff served passed trays of mini chicken and pork nachos.  The corn chowder was my favorite, served with cubes of Mexican cheese and dusted with a sprinkling of chili powder.  Everything was very good.

We ate at the other Chuck&#39;s location, in Burbank, and I wasn&#39;t impressed, but I really liked the food served here, so I wouldn&#39;t discount Chuck&#39;s for another visit.

The event was held in the banquet hall which is much more impressive inside than it is on the outside.  The hall is lovely, really mostly a blank canvass for your creative mind, with elegant chandeliers hanging from the ceiling.

We really enjoyed ourselves at the event, and now I look forward to heading up north to Ten Ninety brewing sometime and returning to Chuck&#39;s for a meal."

Even though we&#39;ve moved out to Arlington Heights, Chuck&#39;s is still one of our favorite places to go (and not just for drinks!!!) The staff is always so friendly and great with suggestions! I&#39;ve tried multiple items here. My favorite for breakfast would have to be either the Bananas Foster French Toast or the Cajun Cakes Benedict. I can&#39;t even begin to tell you my favorite lunch/dinner options because everything I&#39;ve tried has just been incredible! You can tell that they really put love into each meal. The barbecue is to die for- especially the Korean sauce or the honey chipotle sauce. The stuffed prawns or stuffed mushrooms? You better believe they&#39;re life changing. They come drenched in cheesy, garlicky goodness. If you can- try to check out a tapas Tuesday so that you can try a little bit of everything!!! 
Main point- if you like southern, barbecue, or Cajun food, this place is a MUST HAVE. So glad that they expanded from their Burbank restaurant to Darien and I can only hope that they&#39;ll also move to the Northwest suburbs!!!"

We first visited the Darien location about a year and a half ago.. it was OK but I thought that we needed to give it another try to see if that just OK experience was indicative of the location.. or just a blip on the radar. Obviously this experience kept us from rushing back.

We walked in just before noon on a Sunday.. I was having a &#34;man-date&#34; (his daughters terminology, not mine) with my old buddy Mark who was in town for a couple of days.

We walked in at 11:50 and they said that they wouldn&#39;t be seating for lunch for 10 minutes.. no biggie... Mark and I have a lot of catching up to do.. half an hour later.. we are still the only people waiting so we check with the hostess.. they forgot about us and seated us right away.

I&#39;m not a big fan of their gumbo, it&#39;s more of a seafood chowder to me, that doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s not good.. I just prefer a style more similar to Heaven on Seven.. with a thick roux, Andouille and a small mound of white rice. So I got their Chucks Red which is a really tasty chili and worth the trip.

Mark got the gumbo, thought it was OK.. wished he&#39;d gotten the Chuck&#39;s Red too. He made the gumbo one of his three choices for the BBQ sampler. He thought the ribs were really good and the Hot Link was excellent when it was hot (I tasted it, yum) but lost something as the temperature cooled.

It was Sunday and the special of the day is Mexican pot Roast... you don&#39;t have to ask me twice!

When it came out, I was a bit disappointed.. it&#39;s not the prettiest dish in the world. Fortunately, I approached this with an open mind.. because it was pretty damn delicious. The potatoes were mashed with cheese in them (yum) and the mixed veggies were more like stuffing veggies. Everything was swimming in the Au Jus and was terrific as is.. BUT! I had me some fresh tortillas and when I made some Pot Roast/Mashed Potato Tacos.. that pretty much sealed the deal! Also, as a side note there was virtually no fat on the meat.

So, Mark was a little disappointed in his food. Mine was quite good. He was shocked that my food was quite a bit less expensive than his.

I don&#39;t love the atmosphere at this spot either, it&#39;s not indicative of the style of food. But I think that&#39;s a function of the location doing a lot of catering and events.

Hot sauces (had to ask for them) are the El Yucateco brand, good sauces.. they brought out all three and I immediately went for the Hottest one (That&#39;s the one that is NOT brightly colored) I like these and they are acceptable.. it would be fun if they offered some sauces to try that I can&#39;t buy at the local Jewel."

I mean fried chicken, BBQ and so forth. Well, Chuck&#39;s Southern Comforts Cafe is here to deliver, with a range of southern and Cajun treats to nourish you. 

Oddly enough, the feller and I didn&#39;t even go with the most southern stuff on the menu. Well, we did start out with a special of some sort of Cajun-spiced shrimp, which were indeed spicy as advertised, and we retained the plate to keep mopping up the sauce with the little twisted footballs of bread that were provided. 

He went more southern than me and got the gumbo, which did indeed have okra in it (a point of contention among gumbo-eaters: I lived in New Orleans and have listened to this argument many times -- is it real gumbo without okra in it?! Well, this was real, and really tasty, according to himself.)

What appealed to me that night was the Caesar salad, with an unusual jalapeno-lime dressing (again, spicy!), with grilled chicken added. usually a Caesar is just a Caesar, but the dressing added a fun zip that was different and memorable. 

Our waitress Ariel was friendly and fun and took good care of us. We had a back booth that was quieter as it was tucked away from the more bustling area of the restaurant, overall it was pretty busy.

The restaurant is very big, and they also have a banquet hall on-site (and do catering too), so this place is no secret. So the next time you need a shot of southern comfort, look to Chuck&#39;s!"

As for service it was average at best.  Server seemed to be very attentive to get our order but after that he seem to disappear into oblivion.   We waited about an hour to get seated and once we were it was at a table right next to the bar which made talking kind of hard as it was extremely loud inside.  My husband had jambalaya with shrimp and the portion was large.  He said it was very spicy like he likes and enjoyed it very much.  I got the beef brisket dinner and while the brisket was tender , juicy and just the right amount of smoke the sides were ehhhhhhh ok.  The green beans were good but the Mac and cheese was really dry and bland..did they even put cheese in it???? 

Would we go back, yes to try some other items and probably go at lunch time so it&#39;s not so crowded.

This place was pretty empty for lunch so I&#39;m curious as to why everything took so long. However, the wood paneling and low, yellow lighting gave the place a southern feel authentic enough to convince someone who has no real experience of the south (me).

Everything is super down home southern comfort food so if you&#39;re on a diet, congratulations you played yourself. The menu enormous so we asked the waitress to suggest something to us and she proceeded to recommend like 20 dishes. Thanks bro. She also wasn&#39;t great with describing the food to us; we were pretty new to the world of complex meat orders. It took us maybe ten minutes to decide what we wanted, eventually opting to split mozzarella sticks and a BBQ combo of a half rack of ribs + pulled pork. 

The mozzarella sticks arrived in good time and were delightful as deep-fried cheese-centered sin bombs always are. The main order took some time. We both ordered sides of Mac &#39;n&#39; Cheese, and it was like a sticky cheesy little bowl of heaven A+. I don&#39;t know what possessed me to pour barbecue sauce over it but it happened and I have regrets. Pulled pork was decent but the portion was rather small. I will admit to knowing very little about ribs, but these ribs were AMAZING and I couldn&#39;t get enough. gooooooood shit, but only a half rack :( that combo meal definitely did not last as long as we had hoped, so we looked at ordering some more.

 We had some questions about the rib tips since neither of us had ever had them, and the waitress again proved less than useful, rattling off information that was already on the menu and clearly insufficient for meat noobs such as ourselves. She also failed to tell us anything relevant about the barbecue sauce, saying the North Carolina sauce was a vinegar-based sauce in which the vinegar could not be tasted. we had already tried the sweet mesquite sauce, and she vehemently described the mild sauce as &#34;mild&#34;. We went with the NC, which, for the record, was quite vinegary. Also, rib tips are good but super fatty, even in comparison to the rest of the food here. 

The damage at the end of the meal was around $21 for each of us. pretty steep.

tl;dr delicious and rich food (RIBS), largely unhelpful service. I&#39;ll probably come here again though bc omggggg the ribs"

As for food, it was good, but I&#39;ve had better BBQ at Q in La Grange. I had a pulled pork sandwich with potato salad and mac n cheese. The pork was tender, but I found the sauce too sweet. The mac and cheese was creamy, but it tasted like it was made with some kind of cheap american cheese or something. The potato salad was a little sour, I like mine a little sweeter. The food was 3 stars, but the service and drink selection bumped it up to 4 for me. I&#39;d give it another go!"

We had a bridal shower for my daughter here and I&#39;m so glad we did.  We were allowed in to the room early in order to decorate.  We had plenty of tables for gifts and other decorations and the seating was perfect.  The banquet room is HUGE but they have dividers that section off your room according to the number of people you have.  They started serving right on time, bringing out the salads first, followed by mashed potatoes, smoked chicken, pulled pork, mac &#39;n cheese and warm rolls and butter.  (The Ranch dressing was spectacular.)  The wait staff was very polite and attentive and the banquet manager stopped in often to see how things were going and if we needed anything.  The dessert was apple cobbler with ice cream which everyone loved.  

When we booked this venue, we had many choices for our menu and they can serve it plated or family style.  We chose family style since it does promote conversation.  Whenever we have been at the restaurant, it never disappointed and was a perfect choice for an event like this.  Highly recommended!"

It&#39;s not a typical poboy; the main problem was the bread being cut all the way through and too hard.

I&#39;ve been here plenty of times the last few years and the service has at least been...acceptable.  Tonight, however, was by far the worst experience I&#39;ve ever had at a restaurant, let alone a fairly sized chain restaurant.   We had a small reunion gathering tonight and were sat at a long table right near the bar.   First off, our waitress was an absolute mess.  To the point that I tried to get her attention, she acknowledged me, and she proceeded to simply say hi and walk on by.  After 10 minutes I decided I&#39;ll try to get service at the bar.   Our waitress shows up next to me and literally was having a nervous breakdown.  I understand it was busier than I&#39;ve seen it, but wow, she was seriously freaking out.   I proceeded to stand at the bar to attempt service.... I stood there for 5 minutes until a bartender acknowledge me.   Mind you he had seen me multiple times and was not busy at the time.   Finally, with an air of contempt, he finally asks me if I need something.  I told him, yes, I&#39;d like to order some chicken strips for my daughter (since our waitress was clearly not up to to the task).  Next up the chicken strips arrive and I head back to the bar to ask for some salt.  I&#39;m not kidding I stood there for 15 minutes as not one but two bartenders completely ignore me time and time again.   To the point where I finally walked to the kitchen entrance to ask for some assistance.  I get they were slightly busy (place wasn&#39;t half filled) but the fact that I was constantly ignored by employee after employee was almost comical.  I ended up leaving after 45 minutes having planned on spending the majority of my night there.  I&#39;ve never felt more neglected as a customer than I did tonight.  I was simply ignored and treated like a nuisance."

The biscuit and gravy side was ok.  I thought the gravy was good, but the biscuit tasted like it was from a can.

The wait staff was awesome.  Everyone had a smile on their face and seemed happy to be there.  Our waitress was very attentive and knowledgeable.  The coffee and water was full at all times, and they promptly cleaned our plates away.

We were so impressed, that we even hired Chuck to cook for our wedding. We were excited when the Darien location opened - it has a different vibe than Burbank, but still offers the great southern cooking and BBQ that makes Chuck&#39;s great. Recently we enjoyed Tapas Tuesday, where they offer small plates of not only some favorites, but other great selections that are reserved for this event. Not only does Chuck&#39;s offer daily rotating food and beer specials, but there are special offerings for Blackhawks and other sporting events. By far our favorite place for BBQ and other foods!!"

I did not recognize our server from previous visits, and she was great!  Very attentive and familiar with everything on the menu.  She even gave some great beer suggestions.  Our food was outstanding.  Large portions that we have come to expect from Chuck&#39;s but piping hot and fresh (unlike past experiences).

We went to Chuck&#39;s again last Friday night during the Hawks game and experienced the same great service and fresh food.  They must have been reading their Yelp reviews because they&#39;ve done a 360.  Keep it up!"

We got here around 10 and the patio was pretty crowded so we sat inside at a hightop close to the bar.  Our server promptly came over to ask what we wanted to drink.  My husband was in awe of their beer menu.  I asked if it was too early to get a bloody mary (Sunday rules) and she said they start serving alcohol when they open at 7.  Apparently since they have the gambling machines, they can serve any time.  Good to know for football season!  They have plenty of TVs as well.  The bloody was good but nothing special.  They don&#39;t have a lot of wine so if that&#39;s what you like you may want to stick to something else.  However I did get a sauvignon blanc that was okay.  The service was good the entire time.  The portion sizes here are huge.  I would recommend sharing.  I got the special chilaquiles that were habenero.  Thankfully I got these as opposed to their regular cause these barely had any spice so I imagine the regular might be bland but I haven&#39;t had them.  The meat was surprisingly tender.  Sure, there were some pieces with connective tissue but this isn&#39;t exactly a steakhouse so for what they are, I thought the steak was high quality.  I would have preferred a bit more cheese, etc. for me but overall, pretty tasty dish.  My husband got the french toast and he finished the whole thing.

Granted, it is a little strange that when you enter, to the left is a banquet hall called Chateau Orleans Banquets.  Last night there was a wedding reception there, this afternoon, a bridal expo.  Go right.  There is a huge bar area with TVs and then seating that includes high top tables, booths, and regular height tables.  As large as it is, it gets crowded and there might be a wait.  Here&#39;s why.

The food is deeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeelicious.  The menu is covered in wonderful descriptions of tasty sounding food.  Not only does it read as delicious, it is delicious.  We had the beef brisket that was soooooooooooooo tender, no knife required.  We also got an order of ribs  &#34;to go&#34;  and when I got them home I removed the meat from the bones before putting them in the refrigerator.  The meat literally fell off the bones, just the way I like them.   Our sides were also very tasty:  creamy cole slaw, baked beans, and perfectly done French fires.  There were 5 soups to pick from and they bring the cutest shaped rolls, hot, to start.  I see many visits in our future.

So, why only 4 stars?  They only offer spicy, mild, and North Carolina BBQ sauces.  Only 2 of those choices are available on the table AND the mild had a very vinegary taste to it.    BYO sauce for a perfect experience, unless you happen to like vinegar.

They work for families, couples, larger groups.  Stop in for a great experience."

I will probably try the Burbank locations before I try this one again, BBQ, &amp; Creole are what I noticed on the Main Menu. mixed in whatever daily/monthly special they have going on. I personal liked the Creole side of their menu. If you are a beer lover you&#39;ll love this place I think close to 100 beers and a lot of drafts. It&#39;s in your best interest to check the daily/monthly food special before you go. Chuck&#39;s daily/monthly special is only on the menu for certain days. An example: Thursday is Cajun Meatloaf (although you might be thinking $2 off Thursday night for meatloaf... what it really means is Thursday is the ONLY day you&#39;re probably going to get that item.

LONG Overall review
I feel cheated. The photos you see in the yelp review are amazing. So much so that I didn&#39;t even read any of the reviews (which might have gave me a better impression of what I should expect) I decided to take my mother out as she&#39;s been on a diet and was looking for a &#34;off&#34; night. 

Service:
My waiter pulled a Jekyll and Hyde on me. Let me tell you about Jekyll. In the beginning she was slow and rude. (it was a Thursday around 6pm but was slightly busy possible because it was the day before Good Friday/Easter. With that being said, original set down it was only three other groups in her section. but all of them already had food.) After about 10 min of waiting we order an appetizer but forgot where things were on the menu so Jekyll informs us she would put the order in and be right back. Our waiter didn&#39;t come back to AFTER the appetizer was brought out by someone else. (I&#39;m guessing 15+min) So while eating our appetizer she finally walks up to our table and ask have we decided what we wanted. My mother says &#34;The duck gumbo&#34; (plate)is what she wants for her main dish. We are informed that&#39;s not one of the dishes today but she could order the duck soup, What blows are mind is once the waiter pointed out the soup on the menu. My mother tries to take her reading glasses back out her purse to see what she&#39;s referring/pointing to, but I guess this was five sec to long for the waiter because she say&#39;s &#34;I&#39;ll give you some more time to order and flat out walks away....We tried calling her back (cause hell, we&#39;ve read the menu 60x with all that waiting and knew our 2nd, 3rd and 4th options we were going to pick,) but we felt like she purposely ignored us and kept walking away. 5 min later she comes back and we order.

A 2nd &#34;someone else&#34; brings out the main dish.  Jekyll disappear and Hyde shows up  &#34;Oh how is your dish&#34; &#34;That&#39;s my favorite&#34; &#34;Want anything to drink?&#34; Good choice&#34; She even started talking about the dessert and making  comments about leaving room for dessert as they are really famous for certain dessert dishes. 

Food:
I order the Chuck&#39;s Cajun Cakes (5/5) and the Shrimp &amp; Crab Au Gratin (4/5) as appetizers. Those two things were amazing. These two things have saved this review from being a 1 star.

My main dish the Cajun Blackened Filet Mignon Tail. It was disappointing for two reasons. 1 I wasn&#39;t impressed with the taste of this  2. It wasn&#39;t even what I wanted..... I thought this was the same plate from a photo on yelp but it turns out that particular filet mignon photo was only on TappaTuesday (only on the 3rd Tuesday of the month). Basically I did the same thing my mother did earlier. I picked a dish that was from a photo but because the description in the photo said filet mignon. I made the mistake of assuming it was the same thing that was on their main menu. So although I&#39;ll admit this was more of my fault because the yelp photo does show #tappatuesday at the end of the description and it was something that I should have thought about when it happened to my mother. Jekyll wasn&#39;t really all that friendly to start with. Otherwise I probably would have pointed directly to the photo which I had questions about and asked her had she tried the dish. This is what I normally do when It come to food photos, but didn&#39;t want to be bothered cause Jekyll gave me the impression we was wasting her time and should get out and stop breathing.  (not sure which order she wanted us to do)

My mother choose to get the BBQ Combo (half slab baby back ribs and Beef Brisket)  as her main dish. She was happy with it and I&#39;m a big guy and must say it was a LARGE portion of food. Although she was happy with it. both the ribs and brisket I sampled were extremely fatty. However I thought he BBQ sauce was good and can see why they are popular.

Enjoyed the  two drinks (Grape Mojo (3/5) and the Hoodoo ElixirI (4/5) Both were well mixed and tasted great.)

Location/Decor

Inside is nice. Great for families or just grabbing a few drinks with friends. I was there one time and a painting class was going on during the dinner service (a Monday night I believe).

It is in somewhat of an awkward building which is half restaurant half banquet hall. The restaurant part is very large with a pretty big bar. They also have outdoor seating.

For drinks I had a blue moon mixed with ginger beer which was one of their drink specials...it was ok but a bit watered down with way too much ice. My husband ordered a beer from their very large beer list.

Let me say the BBQ nachos were sooo good! Lots of delicious bbq pulled pork with shredded cheese and delicious guacamole. My husband and I could have probably eaten just this and been full but of course we ordered pulled pork sandwiches too!  The pulled pork was tender and had a perfect amount of bbq sauce (which you can order mild or spicy). For sides I had coleslaw and Mac and cheese. The coleslaw was great! It had the perfect balance between veggies and dressing. The Mac and cheese was pretty good but I am picky when it comes to the perfect Mac and cheese and this one was slightly too creamy. My husband had coleslaw and fries. The fries were nicely seasoned but could have been warmer.

Overall it was pretty good bbq considering we aren&#39;t in Texas! We will be back."

First, it has both a conceptual and physical identity crisis. Is it a  southern restaurant, a BBQ joint, or a Mexican place? Turns out none, the food is crummy. Is it a sportsbar, a family restaurant,  or a banquet hall? 

You can see where I&#39;m going with this. Long story short, I paid $55 for a meal they wouldn&#39;t serve you at TGI Fridays.

It began with being given no less than four different menus, and the waitress giving a five minute explanation of all the specials, sides, beers and platters. we felt like we needed to be taking notes.

Next, the BBQ. It was smoked to oblivion. Honestly I think the ribs were rubber bands from Staples and the brisket was cardboard from a Papa John&#39;s box. The hot link was ok. 

Hello??? I lived in Kansas for three years, enjoying true smoked meats and real sauce. This is an embarrassment to the BBQ world.

The sides were store bought crap. Thanks for trying to trick me. I&#39;d rather have Kraft macaroni. A real southern or BBQ joint takes serious pride in their sides. Chuck&#39;s takes their minivan to Sam&#39;s club to purchase their sides.

Finally, the marketing bullcrap was so thick it was disgusting. &#34;Have dinner with Chuck!!!&#34;. Why? So he can tell me how to buy stuff from Schwann&#39;s and overcook it? And what&#39;s all this about Chuck working for Rick Bayless? Granted Bayless is a dbag, but Chuck must&#39;ve bussed tables for Ricky Rocket. 

Pro tip: fire your full time graphic designer and hire a real cook.

Pro tip 2: avoid this dumpster fire. Seriously I would&#39;ve rather gone to Popeyes."

Over the course of the last 15 years, I&#39;ve seen restaurant-bars come and go from this location (most recently Cornerstone), but it looks as though Chuck&#39;s is here to stay for good, and I for one am very glad.  They have an amazing menu that gets populated with new items seasonally and I&#39;ve only experienced a few blemishes across half a dozen visits.

Their food style is distinctly &#39;southern&#39;, with plenty of delicious side dishes to go with the barbeque items, as well as a handful of &#39;Nawlins-inspired items.  You can&#39;t go wrong with any of their BBQ, but the pulled pork and smoked brisket are standouts.  Make sure you upgrade to the &#34;deluxe&#34; (comes with 2 sides), and get the mac&#39;n&#39;cheese + baked beans.  The jalapeno cornbread sounds better than it actually is (brought out to us at room-temp).

I&#39;m not sold on their Cajun.  I&#39;ve had the jambalaya (surprisingly weak), catfish po-boy (meh), and gumbo (decent, but once found a sliver of bone / hard plastic in the bottom of the bowl.  not cool guys.)  Some may find the cajun to be good, but frankly speaking, I would get it elsewhere--Pappadeux&#39;s and Heaven on Seven come to mind.

If Chuck&#39;s falters with their Cajun, they atone for it with beer.  A LOT of it.  Tons of uncommon brews on tap and an extensive beer list that would rival most other places&#39; wine lists.  The beer flight is the way to go - sample several and find your new favorite!  I sure did - Allagash White, thankyouverymuch.

Breakfast is a whole &#39;nother story.  EXCELLENT choices, but a standout is the bananas foster french toast that&#39;s topped with freshly-sliced bananas, slathered in caramel and topped with pecans.  It&#39;s so good it&#39;s sinful, it&#39;s so sinful you&#39;ll need to head to Confession afterwards.  Once a month on a Sunday, Chuck&#39;s features beignets and cafe-au-lait for a nice change of pace.

The interior is clean, always festively-themed, and generally well-staffed.  Service has been consistently good, save for one time I ate here at an off-hour (like 2pm) and was forgotten about amidst the server shift change.  They&#39;ve got slots and video poker, too, for those of a gambling persuasion.  Good location on Cass Avenue, nice and close to my childhood home in Darien :)

So, long story short (too late), I&#39;m right on the fence with Chuck&#39;s....good enough to be deserving of 5*, but a couple missteps with food bring it back to a 4*.  In all honesty, I&#39;d give them 4.5 / 5.

Would I recommend?  Sure, youbetcha."

We were blown away with what seemed like an endless custom menu of great smaller portions to sample. The two of us had a 6 course meal, left a generous tip for our outstanding server Kathy and it only cost $30 each. You must give this a try.

I&#39;ve also made it in for several of Chuck&#39;s special buffet evenings with live music and also his monthly &#34;Dinner with Chuck&#34; at 7 p.m. Where he features numerous unique smoked meats directly out of the smoker and he hand carves them before you and always offers wonderful sides.

If you don&#39;t have Mardi Gras plans yet, be sure to check out his website for his next event February 17th. An alternative schedule is available in his Burbank location too. 

Chuck&#39;s breakfast is always a great way to start your day too! The Mexican flare on many of his menu items are very unique and enjoyable."

The BBQ is not what I expected very dry and not wonderfully flavored. Figure a place that is open 7am till 10pm can&#39;t do much better though. With those hours and the fact they also serve breakfast I have a sense that is why the dinner- BBQ is lacking ( good flavor takes time) just saying.

The original location in Burbank may be the better of the two, but if I&#39;m on the southwest side, I&#39;m probably opting for the Pit Rib House instead and if I&#39;m gonna eat BBQ in the western burbs, I&#39;m sticking with Uncle Bub&#39;s. Sorry Chuck&#39;s.

Chuck&#39;s did have some positives. They have a pretty extensive beer list which is always good in my book. My pulled pork was pretty good, though it was over-sauced. I flipped it all over on the plate so that I didn&#39;t get a heap of sauce with each bite. I&#39;m just here for the pork, man. My side of mac and cheese was decent. Wasn&#39;t a fan of the beans. The bean to sauce ratio was off. My husband got a full slab of ribs. They definitely weren&#39;t &#34;fall off the bone.&#34; He couldn&#39;t pull them apart. He had to use a knife to cut through them. There was a good amount of meat, I&#39;ll give them that, but he said they were a bit tough. 

His sides were pretty terrible. The green beans were inedible. I had a bite and they tasted off. I can&#39;t quite put my finger on it. Definitely from a can but they had a weird flavor. The mashed potatoes were heavy on the garlic and kinda dry. 

We barely saw our server. She checked on us once about a minute after we got our food and then we didn&#39;t see her again for a while. We finished our beers and water before she came by and even then we had to flag her down for some more water. My husband didn&#39;t even get wet wipes after he was done with his ribs. Aren&#39;t those kinda standard at BBQ places? We also got our food in literally 5 minutes after placing it. Not sure what to make of that. I mean you always want your food in a timely matter, but the speed at which it came and the quality of the food leads me to believe they just slopped it on a plate.

The whole experience was disappointing to say the least and I felt bad that I had suggested going there for dinner. I recently saw it on the top 50 best BBQ places in the country. Really? How? If the Burbank location is really THAT good, then the Darien one needs a lot of work."

Our table was all BBQ all the way. There was brisket which was great. Pulled pork, good. Hot link, nice and spicy. Ribs, nice and smoked but must have been forgotten bc they were SO dried out. Mac and cheese which was tasty after it was sent back to be reheated in the microwave---instead of a fresh bowl.

At times in the past I&#39;ve noticed that some restaurants aren&#39;t always on their &#34;A&#34; game for restaurant week. So it&#39;s hard to tell if my experience was the norm or because of Restaurant week. 

Overall my experience was average at best at Chuck&#39;s 

I give one star for service... the restaurant was clean, and nice, had a nice open feeling to it. Our servers were also great, very friendly and funny and attentive 
And I&#39;ll give one star for their Lobster Bisque. It was great. For their Bread pudding. It was delicious and came in huge servings. And for their wide selection of craft beer. 

My main problem is with my main dish... I ordered the &#34;Pasta Magnifique&#34;  It&#39;s not on their regular menu and was one of their monthly specials... which could be another reason for the quality and my issues with it.  Simply put... the  dish was horrible.  I am not a picky eater at all, but the dish was just overcooked and unappetizing.  To start, it was probably the worst pasta I&#39;ve had in a restaurant in as long as I can remember.  The pasta was so overcooked that the fettuccine tasted like mush and had no texture.  On top of that it was served with the largest head of broccoli I&#39;ve been given in a restaurant...  I wish I had taken a picture of it, because the size of it was comical. The head of broccoli was easy the size of a softball, and when the plate was put down me and my girlfriend couldn&#39;t help but laugh about it.  The broccoli was supposed to be steamed... it wasn&#39;t, or at most was only lightly steamed.  It tasted almost completely raw. I suspect that because of the size it wasn&#39;t properly steamed long enough..... I like raw broccoli, but raw broccoli doesn&#39;t go with an Alfredo dish and I ended up just having a softball size garnish on my plate.  When bringing home my leftovers I actually had to re-steam the broccoli myself.  The fact that Chuck&#39;s doesn&#39;t have any other real pasta dishes, and that they spelled &#34;fettuccine&#34; wrong on their website should have been a red flag for me.

Even with the problems with my main dish I didn&#39;t dislike Chuck&#39;s.... I just didn&#39;t have a good first experience and  don&#39;t see myself going back any time soon."

Hadn&#39;t been to a Chuck&#39;s before and was skeptical having been to the previous two failed bar/restaurants at this location. There was a line to request a table which surprised me: &#34;For this place?&#34; I thought. Chuck&#39;s made some mostly superficial improvements using the existing spaces pretty much as they were previously which made me more skeptical. You still have to walk through the somewhat same divey bar area, but now with more tables where you can order, on your way back to the main dining area consisting of ample booths and large-party tables. The place was way busier than I remembered it on previous visits. The new outdoor seating is a very nice addition and was very busy. Any fears related to the previous places ended here.

Our waitress was prompt and friendly.  The beer menu is awesome with a fantastic selection of quality craft beers and ciders. I had the smoked half chicken which was luscious and made even better with the vinegar-based North Carolina style BBQ sauce I had on the side. Fries were done perfectly and ample. Coleslaw was fresh and a perfect complement. The only better complement was the Xingu Brazilian schwarzbier. Wide selection of apps, entrees, sides, and deserts. Five of us got out for $75 including drinks and tip which was a very solid deal. 

Try it, you&#39;ll probably like it if you enjoy good casual eats at a casual price. Bring the fam but not too late with young kids."

French Toast is a good choice and any of their skillets. I always order Huevos Rancheros or Huevos Montulenos (scrambled). Both plates are 5 stars! Coffee is great and their Bloody Mary&#39;s are very good. 
Overall this is the place that I want everyone to come with me for breakfast/brunch!

My Lunch Review: 
I wanted to show off this place to my friend but I realized that breakfast ends early! We ordered Cornbread which is a great way to start lunch! It was just perfect! There was also an extensive beer/drink list for lunch and dinner. I don&#39;t like cajun food so I ordered the Chicken Wing Dinner and I really liked my potato salad. The wings were great also but too greasy for my liking. I still enjoyed them though. 

Service is great..the price is right it is a very casual laid-back place with a big bar area and tvs. There is nothing to say about the decor...but this place is really all about the FOOD!"

The soup. Chuck offers like 6-8 soups a day. If it has the word chowder- it&#39;s not a chowder- it&#39;s like a bisque that the angels kissed. I have tried several corn, crab, jalapeno, poblano, scallop, some variation of this chowder and again- so magical I would come just for soup. 2. Extensive beer menu and fun bar specials- come during a bears game- you will not be disappointed. 3. The food is pretty darn good- I love the Mexican pot roast, his chilaquiles, banana fosters French toast, and the pulled pork is phenomenal. The menu is extensive and has comfort/ southern/ BBQ/ Hispanic/ creole items. He has so many specials daily and some day I&#39;m going to have off on tapas night.... I hope. 

Okay, so here&#39;s the thing... the servers are friendly, but sometimes not my favorite part of the meal... and I served for years... one told me about the time she was slipped exlax. Truly. That and I expect someone who cooks everything so well to make amazing mac and cheese. This is possibly the worst mac and cheese I&#39;ve ever had in my life (it&#39;s a processed fake cheese and it makes me sad). So- yes, there are 2 things I didn&#39;t love, but the soup more than makes me want to go back and my server can tell me all kinds of horrible things as long as she brings me my soup."

I was expecting that the newer location in Darien would be the same or better. Things did not work out as I had hoped.

The location was/is a banquet hall, so the restaurant is very large. Lots of free parking.

The menu has lots of craft beers which is pretty cool.

The food was no where near as good as what we&#39;ve gotten at the other location. My pulled pork was overly salted and my sauce was almost too sweet. My dining partner had the etouffee, which was vey small portion-wise and not very flavorful.  

Server was pleasant."

If I don&#39;t want an entire pizza for myself, I&#39;ll stop in every now and then and buy a slice - they sell slices there of decent size as well.  I am big on picking my orders up, they are always prompt and my order is ready when I arrive.  I most recently bought and used a groupon which was an excellent deal...an extra large pizza with one topping, cheezy garlic bread and sauce to dip it in, all so very good!

We don&#39;t really delve much from the pizza by a slice, because two slices for $6 is a steal and it feeds both of us. They offer a different slice each day. Many times by evening times though it&#39;s there isn&#39;t any of it left, but that&#39;s ok, as we usually eat just plain cheese. My husband has had a few other things from their menu and has liked all of them.

They&#39;ve done quite a few aesthetic updates and it has really brought the place up to date. 

The only thing that stops me from giving them 5 stars is the varying service. 95 percent of the time the owner (or what I assume to be the owner) is there and the food is fantastic! I&#39;ve seen him throw pizza out that has been sitting for a while. He&#39;ll let us know when things are just about out to help guarantee freshness. There is another guy who works there though (maybe another owner? or his brother?) and when he&#39;s in charge the food is just mediocre. The pizza by the slice which is normally fresh, is luke warm, crunchy and almost burnt tasting when this other guy is there."

The staff seemed friendly.

They put pickles on an Italian....weird to me but you can leave them off if you like. I also found it odd that there was no pepperoni. Mortadella and salami. I really wish someone would use a home made Italian dressing.  I prefer a vinegar  and oil mix instead of a mass market bottle of sub par crap. 

So I guess it&#39;s one and done on the sub, I will try the pizza burger but I&#39;m not at all impressed with the food quality thus far."

I have only had delivery or pick-up but for the price, you cannot go wrong.  I love their pizza bianco, no red sauce, just olive oil, garlic, tomatoes, vidalia onions and cheese.  It&#39;s simple and delish.

On Mondays and Tuesdays they have a great deal if you are a cheap ass and don&#39;t mind eating early.  If you order pizza between 4 - 5 p.m., it&#39;s half off and it you order pizza between 5 - 6 p.m. it&#39;s 25% off.  Screaming deal I say.

I think their pizza is solid.  No wood burning oven here hipsters but deal with a solid family friendly pizza place in Lisle and be happy it&#39;s here."

I am really picky about my Italian beef being drenched in au jus with mozzarella and the whole thing just having a perfect marriage of flavors. It was spot on. Hubby is an authentic Sicilian so he is extremely picky about his sauces. He says to me &#34;please don&#39;t forget about this place. This sandwich is amazing.&#34; So obviously this place fits the bill. 

Besides the food, I noticed so many good deals, coupons, etc and we got a significant amount of food for less than $20. Needless to say, we&#39;ll be coming back for more! 

One last thing, the man who delivered the food was the nicest delivery person alive. Actually said to please call if anything isn&#39;t to our liking (how often does that happen?!)"

I was the only person in the restaurant when I went in. Two fire fighters were in line behind me but they had an order to pick up. The kitchen is wide open so I could see that people were just sitting around talking and flirting with each other. After waiting 30 minutes, I finally approached the counter and asked how much longer. The lady stated that they were very busy and it&#39;d be a few more minutes. 10 minutes later, it finally came out. 40 minutes total. I bet if I would&#39;ve stayed at the hotel and ordered delivery, it would have arrived sooner. Some ladies came in after me an got their pizza first. There was no apology at all. Not from the lady behind the counter, and certainly not from the manager who asked why I was standing at the counter when I went to ask where my pizza was. He just turned around and walked away. 

Sometimes, the food is worth trouble. This was definitely not one of those times. The dough is bland and tastes like it was pre-made. Neither chewy or crunchy. The sauce needs more herbs and salt. The whole thing was rather bland. So disappointed in it after reading the reviews. C&#39;mon Lisle, you guys are right next to Chicago - if you think this is good pizza, you need to be willing to pay the tolls and visit Chicago every now and then and get a taste of what pizza is supposed to taste like. 

After a few bites, I was so disgusted with the whole experience I asked for a box so I could leave. They brought out a small box for my medium pizza. Lack of attention to the details again.  

I could see this whole thing happening at a Pizza Hut or some other large chain, but for a local pizzeria, this is just absolutely unacceptable. Fail on every level."

The worst time to arrive is around 9pm if you&#39;re getting the already made slices because they tend to be pretty dried out by then. The quality varies, but when it is fresh, it is always good, but once in a while you get a perfect crust which is both soft and crispy, like today when we walked here to get pizza through the Blizzard. 

Also, the only other thing I&#39;ve had besides their Pizza is their nachos and it would probably be good if you like Chili Powder. I&#39;m not a fan of it in Nachos and the meat was filled with it. Also, the salsa tastes like Chili Powder as well, which I do not enjoy, but it is well-made."

It&#39;s as good as it looks in the picture: thick, chewy crust and great toppings. Be warned it is far too much for one person. Ask for a box to take home leftovers. 

In my outing here, the main problem was it took an extremely long time for the pizza to be ready. I dined here with a friend who ordered a different item and was almost finished before my pizza came out. You order at the counter fast-food style and pick it up there. Also, the place is super dingy and old. It&#39;s not a place to take a date or someone else you want to impress."

The Italian beef was just average hot dog stand quality, not bad but nothing special. That was the best of the 3 items. The burger was almost burned to a crisp and the fries were overcooked, dry, and had no flavor.  I never cared for their pizza so this was the first time getting sandwiches.

I read the reviews here before and they were not good, but I see they are under new management (not sure when that started) so I thought I would give this place a try.   I ordered a small thin crust pizza with tomatoes and onions and a small garden salad.  I went and picked it up because I didn&#39;t want to pay the 2.50 delivery charge.  It was ready when I got there (they told me 25-30 minutes). I left at the 25 minute mark. :)    The pizza was hot and tasty. The crust was good.  The salad was fresh and looked  like it did NOT come out of a bag mix. It was iceberg lettuce with like a sliced tomato cut up, a cucumber slice cut up,  very small pieces of carrots and red cabbage. It was fine for what I wanted. But let me say that it was fresh!  That is important to me.  The cashier was friendly.  It was tasty enough that I will try something else there when I go back again.  Give this place another chance!"

The map directions on the yelp app are totally wrong because we were led about a 1/2 mile down the street into a residential area. My boyfriend and I noticed there was a shopping center that we&#39;d passed that just had a sign that read PIZZA on its store front we laughed about how unoriginal that sign was, and low and behold this was Passeros!!. The address listed is incorrect. This location is on Lincoln avenue/rt 53. Pulling into the parking lot I was about to leave because Passeros looked closed. They really need to invest in better lighting that actually makes them appear to be open. They still had an hour and a half til closing time. I thought the prices listed were expensive. 25 bucks for a large one topping pizza with garlic bread, and soda. Passeros offers pizza by the slice which was perfect because I could judge if the pizza was worth spending the money on. 

Let me say I would&#39;ve been thoroughly pissed if I spent the money on a full pizza. I opted for a sausage slice which the sausage was good, but the crust was nasty. The crust had a very weird taste to it. I didn&#39;t notice it until I got to the end of the slice where there was more dough. Get rid of whatever that weird taste was and Passeros would have an okay slice of pizza."

I heard they were under new ownership and i was offered a deal through grubhub so I decided to give them another shot. I ordered a medium sausage pizza and an order of wings. The first thing I noticed was that the pizza was not hot! I live less than 1 mile from the shop so this is almost shocking.  It was lukewarm at best. Thin crust pizza should be crispy and crunchy. This pizza was more &#34;rubbery&#34;. I&#39;m very disappointed in the quality of pizza I received and I hope it does not represent their everyday quality. I would have been better off going with a chain pizza place. The wings were hot and tasty with a decent but not to hot buffalo flavor so at least that part of the order was satisfactory.

Passeros just lacks consistency....the pizza ranges from below average at best to just plain God-awful.  I ordered from Passeros maybe half a dozen times and was given an undercooked pizza, a pizza with barely any cheese, and the last time I ordered from them bit into a mouthful of fat in my italian beef pizza.  It was disgusting.
They do offer half prices pizzas from 4-5 on weeknights if you&#39;re really cheap, eat dinner early and don&#39;t mind mediocre pizza.  Personally I&#39;d rather pay full price at a good pizzeria."

My boyfriend and I decided late on a sunday to order pizza, so obviously our options were limited. Passero&#39;s was the only close place open. The timeline goes thus.

10pm. ordered pizza. guy said it was going to be an hour (an hour? for pizza?) and i say &#34;ok cool.&#34;
11pm. no pizza. i call back and ask what the deal is. the girl says he&#39;ll be there any second.
11:30pm. guy finally shows up. we live at most 5-10 minutes from this place. the delivery guy offers no apology or anything, but we figure hey, at least now we have pizza. 

wrong again. we&#39;ve had pizza from here before and it&#39;s been okay. not as good as Papa Saverio&#39;s or even Barraco&#39;s. but on this night, it was actually terrible. it was bland, had almost no sauce at all and the bottom was slightly charred and tasted like cardboard. 

in summary. bad service and bad pizza. better to take the trip to the Danada Jewel and buy some Red Baron frozen pizzas."

The service has always been good, and the burgers are excellent.  I always ask for extra-well-done meat and have never needed to send the burger back, which is a huge plus.  The Tap House Grill fries are delicious, but you can get a side salad instead.  We have tried the other menu options, but we usually gravitate back to their burgers.

I like that the place is very cute inside.  I like the stone wall and the booths, though it&#39;s a rare treat to be able to get a booth.  Parking is convenient, as there is a huge lot around the corner.  We&#39;re not beer drinkers, so the bar is a non-issue for us.  Despite the many beer reviews online, you don&#39;t feel overwhelmed by the bar when you&#39;re there for dinner, except for the noise.  My primary complaint is that the restaurant is usually very noisy at night and on weekends.  

We have been to Tap House Grill several times to eat in, but only one time for carryout.  Carryout usually means that we have our dog in the car, and she needs a burger, too!  But, Tap House Grill is just a little pricey, so we end up at Culver&#39;s or Portillo&#39;s for burgers carryout more often than Tap House Grill.  

Tap House Grill is a comfortable place with a great decor and lots of interesting options on the menu.  You can enjoy a pleasant, casual dinner out, without the experience being strip-mall casual.  Overall, we like dining at Tap House Grill very much."

For me, it&#39;s ok. Last time we went I had the Sprecher&#39;s braised beef sandwich. I was not expecting it to taste so much like root beer, but it did. It was very sweet and strange. I don&#39;t like it when my savory foods are also sweet. Weird combination. Their mac &amp; cheese is really good, but a little too rich (gave me stomach troubles). Sometimes service is slow, sometimes fast. It is VERY loud inside. They have a pretty good beer selection. 

Last time I was disappointed because aside from ravioli and mac and cheese, there is not one single pasta dish. Also, their &#34;fit&#34; meals are just gluten-free, and definitely not healthy choices. Not too many healthy choices here, unless if you&#39;re going to go off menu."

I feel sad for people that have had a poor experience at this establishment because truthfully, I&#39;ve never been forgotten or ignored by waitstaff. I think the service is exceptional. On a packed night, trivia questions blasting over the intercom, multiple servers running around -- I&#39;ve never had a beer glass go empty for long, and I&#39;ve always been able to order food. 

Best things I&#39;ve had to eat: Sam Adam&#39;s Beer Battered Fried Chicken App. DROOL. It&#39;s just, whoa. So good. The bbq and honey mustard it comes with are just as great. Huge portion for only $9.99. Also, the cheese curd app --- winner. Burgers --- winners. Side salad is delicious. I&#39;m pretty sure they make their own ranch. 

WINGS: Grade A, and that&#39;s saying a lot. Wing rating: 8/10. They are meaty, crispy, and appropriately adorned with your requested sauce. Nice ratio of bicep to forearm pieces. 

XL complaint: We want Trivia Guys Chicago back. They slam dunk everytime. 
L complaint: Too much starch with the food. There should be more emphasis on the protein"

It amazes me that a large number of the staff has been there multiple years. So they are obviously happy and it is fun to make that connection when they recognize or even know your name. 

We are a party of 6 so that is always an odd size. Really too big for booth and normally need to push a few small tables together.  They were waiting for another party of 6 to get up  After all, they had paid their bill. However after 20 min of waiting they still didn&#39;t move so we crammed around a booth as kids were getting hungry. 

I will give tap house credit as they came over and reseated us 10 min later after the other group finally left. 

I don&#39;t normally give 5.0 but will in this case as the staff recognized a situation and addressed. We will be back!"

It was a nice day so we opted to have our party of eight sit outside. I ordered the Sprecher root beer braised beef and Gouda sandwich, which was to die for. I&#39;d drive an hour for this sandwich. The rest of the party had various burgers and sandwiches, which everyone enjoyed. We also sampled their incredible variety of beers and ciders. The server was very slow in coming back to check on our drinks and, at one point, a member of our party had to go inside to wave her down. Apparently guests dining outside are a lower priority. Then, a surprise rainstorm popped up. The table next to us, which had a different server, were immediately whisked inside to a waiting table. Our server, who had forgotten about us again was nowhere to be found. I ran inside to find our server to inform her of the deluge and ask for an inside table. She checked with &#34;someone&#34; and returned to tell us she was sorry, but there was no room for us. The restaurant was half empty. When I pointed this out, she said, &#34;Well, another party is coming in half an hour...&#34; We requested our check and left. 

I&#39;ll give this place another try, but only because the food is good. The service leaves a whole lot to be desired."

Their pretzel sticks are large soft pretzels that come with cheese and mustard sauces. They have several different burgers to choose from, including a veggie burger for your herbivore friends. I had one with fried egg and bacon that was delicious! Their tator tots are crispy and a nice change from your typical French fry. 

The night that I was there the waitress we had was taking care of our table as well as the large party room. Unfortunately, this resulted in a long wait for us.

She did yell across 2 tables to let us know that our food would be right out - even though it took another 10 minutes.

After receiving our food from someone else, she did come over and ask us if we needed anything but no one spoke up because we were all so hungry.

Our waitress was nice and then she completely disappeared. She was having a rough day, that much was perfectly clear. To be honest, I understand having a rough day, but I don&#39;t understand the rest of the visit...

We didn&#39;t get half the drinks we ordered, the food was sub par at best, we had one waitress take our order, another bring the order out, and then I had to flag down a waitress to get our check (no one ever even attempted to check on us). 

Now my criticism isn&#39;t with the initial waitress, but the management staff, and the last waitress that dropped off the check. As a manager, which I&#39;m very familiar with, you take care of your staff, but most importantly, make sure their tables are being looked after! That&#39;s basic management 101. 

The waitress brought our check to us after having to flag her down to have someone get it for us (meanwhile there&#39;s at least 6 employees standing outside in front of the building). She rudely tossed the check on the table and walked away. 

I know there&#39;s not a ton of choices in Oswego to go to, but surely you can do better than this... 

I won&#39;t be recommending it to anyone much less ever stepping foot in there again. 

Avoid at all costs."

This place has a bit of a mixed crowd depending on what time of day it is.  I have seen anywhere from families with small children to bikers (very respectful while I was there).  The general crowd though seems to be people around my age (30) that still like to go out and enjoy a few good beers, but not ones that tend to over indulge to much. One thing to note is that I always seem to be parking in the last available parking spot, so I&#39;m guessing there are times where parking can be an issue."

This is by far the best Tap House location out of the 3 that we have been to including Plainfield and Westmont.  The prices are very fair and the quality of food is above what you would expect a restaurant like this to offer.  A must try are the pretzel appetizer.  They come with cheese and mustard dipping sauces and are very good.  We also like the filet sliders and the steak wedge salad.  The bacon on the salad is absolutely addicting.

During our recent visit to their Oswego location, they featured almost 40 different brews on tap, 8 bottled brands, and 15 canned styles. 

Their food is good too, with a lot of beer-braised or beer-battered items. (I had the Kobe beef slider trio, but they also have soups, salads, tacos, wings, foot-long cheese melts, and lots of appetizers.) They are also kid-friendly, with kids&#39; menus and high chairs available.

The Oswego site, located right by the Fox River, is a bit larger than the Lemont location that we&#39;ve frequented in the past. This is good in a way, but they also tend to cram more tables into that extra space. Our group of four adults and two kids was seated at a table that was kind of awkwardly situated in the open doorway of the adjacent room. 

Service was OK (very friendly waitresses and hostess) but a little spotty - two waitresses offered to get us containers for our extras but then got busy and forgot until we reminded one. 

There was also an odd incident where my first two beers came in pint glasses, but my third one came in a smaller 10-ounce glass, which is usually reserved for drinks with a higher alcohol content. All of my beers were the Oskar Blues Mama&#39;s Little Yella Pils, a pilsner with an ABV of only 5.3. Were they doing some kind of alcohol profiling because I&#39;m a woman and they thought I couldn&#39;t handle three beers? (If they knew me better, they wouldn&#39;t have made that assumption.)

No matter. Any of the Tap House Grill locations are a good choice for a decent lunch or dinner and a great brewsky or two (or three!)."

The bummer of the night started when we sat outside and a random downpour came right before we ordered our drinks.  

We moved inside and it was apparent that they didn&#39;t want to sit us at the high tables in the bar but we were persistent since we didn&#39;t want to be stuck next to the tables next to families with groups of kids.  We got a drink (which was very good) but I started to see the signs of poor service from the very beginning.

We ordered our food and we thoroughly enjoyed everything.  I highly recommend the filet trio sliders. They&#39;re delicious.  We brought my dad home the prime rib sliders and he enjoyed those as well.

My issue with this place is the service.   The girl we had wasn&#39;t all there.  I had to ask a few times to get a refill on my water, but yet she had no problem with trying to serve me another bar drink.  I don&#39;t know if she just got a piercing on her face that week or what but she continuously played with it while she was walking around.  If you&#39;re serving my food and drinks, stop touching  your face. It&#39;s not clean.

In any case, I don&#39;t live up in Illinois anymore so I can&#39;t say whether I&#39;d go back or not. I just think they need to improve on the service side of things. The food is fine."

The Tap also has a huge beer selection and often does special tastings and has guest speakers. We&#39;ll worth a look!

Food wise in general they are a few steps above your Chili&#39;s or Fridays and have some pretty impressive selections. Deep Fried Bacon, Cheese Curds and Bavarian Pretzels are great picks and they have some stellar Burger selections along side really good Tacos.  They also feature some good kids menu options with quality Tots. Food prices used to be higher but have come down a shade so I would say they are reasonable for what you get.

Service wise they are pretty solid, nothing much to say one way or the other.

If you stop in you HAVE to get the House Made Kit-Kat!!!! Wow!

See ya on Tuesdays!"

The last few times we went, it looked very run down. The booth seats had tears in them &amp; the tables felt sticky. Service was also bad even though it was very slow on a weekday afternoon. The food was okay but my Caesar salad was wilted. My beer glass was warm which was disappointing bc I look forward to drinking from a chilled mug. I might give it another shot in a few months but not ready to recommend it to friends."

The Burger was pretty good, especially with the pretzel bun. The pickles had a very strong flavor so I picked them out. The tater tots were too crispy for my taste. 

For drinks, I asked the server if she had any juice. She hesitated and then said yes and I asked what kinds and she just said Orange Juice. I ordered orange juice and then later she mentioned no one had asked her for orange juice in 4 years so she didn&#39;t know if refills were free or not. No biggie, but I just felt awkward for ordering orange juice because of this.... I was actually leaning towards cranberry but she didn&#39;t list it nor did I further inquire.

Anyway... overall the food was &#34;A-OK.&#34;"

I ordered the Kobe beef sliders that came with some special sauce and french fries, my husband ordered the cheese curds and wings that evening. The Kobe beef sliders were only $12, with which you get a side and 3 mini burgers. The burgers were perfectly cooked. The cheese curds came with some sort of beer dipping sauce that tasted amazing, and I&#39;m usually not a fan of those.

That being said, the next time we went back, the servers (and I guess the kitchen) had no idea what sauce was put on the sliders the night we had been in before. It was delicious and now elusive. I&#39;ve had other dishes that are okay, nothing spectacular. The place itself is really nice: there&#39;s a fireplace in the winter and a huge bar, but the restaurant somehow feels intimate and casual. It&#39;s a &#34;tap house&#34; so there&#39;s a large selection of beer, but they have a monthly special so it is not too pricey. It&#39;s also in a quiet part of town, in a beautiful space."
tap-house-grill-oswego,Amanda C.,ZipSMqJ-2xdStZ2hNxDFxA,"Joliet, IL",0,1,0,6,8,bEXvKScb1ySajBGyGJBSFA,3.0,2014-01-11,"We brought my brother here for dinner last night (Friday night 5pm.) I had wanted to try a place in Naperville but I was out voted because no one wanted to make that drive. So his place is close, had decent reviews and my brother said he&#39;d passed it several times and had wanted to try it. 

This place is very very dark. They should turn a few more lights on. It was loud too. I had to keep asking my brother to repeat himself. He was sitting across from me and he&#39;s not a low talker. It was half full of patrons when we arrived, and by the time we left it was pretty full. People were bringing their small kids in, and this is like a sports bar. You should keep your kids at home. While they weren&#39;t loud (which is super annoying when you&#39;re having dinner out with adults, to have to listen to other peoples obnoxious kids) they seemed out of place. 

My boyfriend ordered a beer, and a soda, I ordered sweet tea, my brother ordered unsweetened tea.  For apps we got the pretzel bread and the &#34;totchos.&#34;

My tea was &#34;meh.&#34; Since I&#39;ve been having the best tea in Chicagoland (see the baked apple company review) this just didn&#39;t add up. It wasn&#39;t sour and it didn&#39;t taste old, but it wasn&#39;t really good, ya know? The waitress brought my brother sweet tea so he wasn&#39;t really drinking it. He&#39;s nothing like me. He didn&#39;t ask for the unsweetened tea that he ordered, he waited for the waitress to offer water and he had a glass of that. 

The appetizers were good. The pretzel bread was soft, and the totchos were good. Like having nachos but easier to eat. I liked both of them, but it wasn&#39;t exceptional, nothing I would go out of my way to have again. 

For main courses I got the &#34;Meat and Potatoes&#34;  which was two, 4 ounce fillets (ordered medium rare,)  crispy zucchini fries, and garlic mashed potatoes. My other half had the Kobe burger and fries, and my brother had a pulled pork sandwich and fries.

When my plate arrived it looked very lackluster. It was too big of a plate for the small amount of food served.  It was less than a handful of zucchini fries, a tiny scoop of mashed potatoes with the two tiny fillets on top. My first fillet was cooked nearly perfect. But the second one was medium well bordering on well done. I sent the second one back, because who wants to eat an overcooked fillet? The zucchini fries were probably the best thing I ate all night. I wish I had more of those, it was such a measly portion. The potatoes were kind of bland. This meal is nothing to write home about. My brother liked his pulled pork. My other half thought his burger was okay but thought it was over cooked.  I asked about 3 times if they liked the food and they always said &#34;yeah, it&#39;s alright.&#34; 

We got a homemade kitkat for dinner (forgot to get a picture of that.) It was about the size of a regular kitkat. It didn&#39;t taste like a kitkat but it&#39;s better. It was a chocolate mouse with peanut butter, on a rice crispy like base. It was pretty fantastic. It was very rich. We split one order between the 3 of us. It was just a couple bites a piece but because it&#39;s so rich, it was enough. 

So the food left a lot to be desired, but I&#39;m giving it 3 stars instead of two because our waitress was fantastic. She never let my glass of tea go dry, she checked on us frequently, she was very friendly, she even brought a coupon for a free appetizer on our next visit because of the steak mishap. Chances are we wont be back to use the coupon but it was a nice gesture on her part. Our total ticket for 1 beer, 2 appitizers, 3 main courses, and 1 dessert was $86ish before tip. If you live in the area it&#39;s probably a great place to stop in for some drinks, but I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to eat there."

Since we moved to the area 2.5 years ago, this is our favorite local bar/restaurant! We come here multiple times a month for a quick beer, yummy eats, or the monthly beer school they offer! 

They offer an impressive craft beer list (40 beers on tap), and the only &#34;non-craft beer&#34; is Miller Lite. I believe all of their staff are cicerone servers so they are great at recommending beer choices! Once in a while they will do a Dollar Draft night and all of their beers will be $1- we try not to miss this! Speaking of beer, the second Sunday of the month there is a beer school here, and for $20 you get 5 samples of the featured beer style that month, some apps, and lots of valuable info by their knowledgable cicerones! My friends and I have learned a lot and hope to keep coming!

As for food, they never disappoint! Some of our favorites are the Four Napkin Pulled Pork Nachos, Totchos (tater tot nachos), Pretzels, TapHouse burger, Sprecher Root Beer Sandwich, Merkts Steak Sandwich, and the Housemade KitKat! 

If you get on their email list, you will be notified of the many specials they run, like holiday brunches, beer school, Sunday fundays ($5 Bloody Mary bar), beer dinners, special beer flights, or tappings of upcoming new beers! 

We have been to a few other Taphouse locations, but the Oswego one is our home! Thanks THG!"

My plate consisted of a thin chicken cutlet sliced in half, served over mashed potatoes covered in parsley.  Did i miss something?

The list of beers on tap was at least 30 long and included beers from Goose Island, Lagunitas, Solemn Oath, and a lot more that I&#39;d never heard of.  

3 of us sat in the patio area.  A friend had the tilapia for dinner and followed up with the stuffed chocolate cake.  Despite there being a bone in his fish, he said it was really good.  And the cake looked really good - very rich and definitely STUFFED with chocolate.  My husband and I were stuffed from a family party earlier in the day, so we just had our beer.  But I would definitely go back for the Kit-Kat dessert or the fried bacon.

Taphouse was reasonably priced with a relaxed atmosphere.  It&#39;s more of a &#34;jeans and a t-shirt&#34; kind of place in my eyes, but there was a number of women here in LBD&#39;s and evening handbags.

Great food. Love the beer selection!
The bartenders are always able to make great beer suggestions! I really appreciate the efforts Jason and Chad have made to recommend some outstanding beers. 
The loaded tater tots are awesome! Although, I don&#39;t think you can go wrong with anything on the menu. I noticed they&#39;ve added poutine to the menu, so I&#39;ll definitely have to get back to try that.
If you have a free Wednesday night, trivia is a good time. Beer school on the 2nd Sunday of the month is a lot of fun and a chance to broaden your beer horizons. The Tap House Burger is pretty yum, so burger night is pretty convenient and affordable :)
During the summer the outdoor seating is a nice option (unless the Fox River insect population has gone haywire, which happens from time to time). At any rate, if you are looking for a great place in Oswego, you should totally stop by!"

Our meal then took about another half hour to 45 minutes to come out... in addition the food was less than par and also Luke warm. .. gross. .. we had another friend come to join our table towards the end of our two hour dining. .. she went to go place an order with our waitress who again disappeared. ... by the time the waitress came back, only because it was dying down, she asked our friend if she wanted anything to drink, our friend said &#34;no thanks I went up to the bar&#34;... our waitress said &#34;oh great, thanks !&#34; And walked away. ... almost like we were inconvenieNing her. ... bottom line we walked out of this place extremely annoyed and frustrated. ..

We sat at the bar and split the Totchos, which is basically amped up nachos that replaces the chips with mutha  truckin&#39; TATER TOTS! It&#39;s a widely known fact that a tot is the best form of fried potato, so of course this was awesome.

It is so hit or miss.  Sometimes the food and beer list are spot on.  Other times it is horrible.  This location switches management often and when that happens the quality of the food changes...sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse.  The burgers are solid.  Can never go wrong there.  Love the chili but sometimes you can get an old batch. I just wish they would work on consistency.

Drove by first to see how crowded it looked. Not crowded at all. Many open tables outside so we decides to go in. Inside also has many open tables. We were told it would be a half hour wait. I asked why given all the open tables. They told me the kitchen was backed up. So decide to wait. 30 minutes later our name is called and we are told we would be seated but we can&#39;t order for food for 45 minutes! What???! Why wouldn&#39;t they tell me 1:15 minute wait? And I was two children under the age of 5. If this was the first time it happened it would be one thing, but this is the fourth time this happened. Every time we have been here there have been open tables and we have been told we have to wait. We will not be going back. If you like terrible service give it a try."

I got the drunken chicken and shrimp that comes with a generous portion of beans and rice. It had the perfect amount of heat and flavor.

We were cool waiting for it by the way, it was our request after all. The busser is quick, but forgets to wipe the obvious lettuce off the table. Our server starts to redeem the experience, but after ordering something simple, Spicy Wisconsin Cheddar &amp; Scallion Fries, we have to cancel the order because we were trying for a quick visit and it had been fifteen minutes for a basic appetizer.

Ultimately the food here is great. Easily the best pizza in Aurora.  I&#39;ll be ordering again mainly because i appreciate the owner getting involved and making an effort to prevent future mistakes for that I&#39;ll bump it up to 4 stars.


*UPDATE*  Within 24 hours of posting this review i received a call from the owner and had a conversation with him for about 10 minutes.  He seemed like he really cared that i had been having a bad experience and offered a credit for the times i have had trouble.  He generally seems like he cares about his customers so I&#39;m willing to give them another chance. Seeing an owner reach out like that and care was definitely unexpected/welcome.  Because of that i have bumped this up one star and plan to update this review based on my next experience. *UPDATE*  


I&#39;ve had nothing but bad experiences at dough balls. 3 times I&#39;ve ordered from this place and gotten 1 pizza charred to an inedible crisp, 2nd was almost raw dough at the center and now the 3rd time it&#39;s missing 2 out of 3 ingredients and when i called back to explain the issue I was treated with hostility.  I wasn&#39;t asking for free food I was asking for them to not screwup again but they acted like I was demanding to much when I expect what the menu says the pizza comes with."

Well, turns out Doughballs is open super late too, and similarly delivers into the wee hours of the morning, which is pretty rad. Their menu is crazy, featuring pizzas that come topped with all sorts of insane stuff.

We ended up ordering a small mac and cheese pizza and decided to hedge our bets in case that was too weird and also got a small cheese and sausage. Throw a couple of appetizers into the mix, and we were at over $60 with tip, tax, and delivery fee... Which feels like a lot for some late night snacks. But, hey, whatever.

Our food arrived almost cold, which is sort of inexcusable for pizza delivery as you really just have one job: Bring pizza to my house while it is still warm. If I was feeling adventurous I could walk to Doughballs, so it&#39;s not like the driver has to make some epic trek out to my house.

The tricky part of all this is how do you score a place like this? Prices are high, delivery is bad, but once we tossed the food in the oven to warm it all up a bit everything was... Kinda amazing. The problem is, I&#39;m just not sure that pizza at these prices is sustainable in Aurora, and if you can&#39;t offer a consistent experience when you&#39;re doing delivery (judging by other reviews which are all over the place between &#34;Delivery was super-fast!&#34; and &#34;My pizza arrived over an hour later cold.), you should just not deliver.

I keep saying we should order from Doughballs again, but when there&#39;s really no shortage of good pizza in the area for way cheaper, well, it&#39;s easier to just grab a pie from somewhere else."

We had the Hog Heaven pizza, and added French fries to it. It was very good &amp; everything fit together nicely.
They were obviously busy with deliveries when we got there (we ate in, since we live in Oswego and didn&#39;t want to wait to get home), the employee / manager apologized for the wait and offered us an appetizer, we chose the Bosco sticks and they were also great.
The dining area is small, as they specialize in delivery, but if you don&#39;t live in the area and find yourself downtown, stopping in would be the best choice.

There is a sign inside the store that reads &#34;Fast, Cheap, Good - you can only pick two&#34;

It should read &#34;Slow, expensive, and sub-par - you have to pick all three&#34;

Lackluster and immature crew working the front of the store. 

The pizza I ordered was beyond greasy and it was thrown together without care. 

Standards have gone out the window. 

The only thing keeping this store afloat is the fact that it is run by the son of one of the owners from Ballydoyle AND MORE IMPORTANTLY that most of their business is in the late night hours where all the drunk people need something to soak up all the beer. 

Thing is, drunk people have no idea how bad the food really is. Just that it is hot and available for a small cost.

I had such hope for this place in the beginning. The food was actually really good. 

It has gone downhill horribly since then. 

I am blown away that it is still even in business.

My advice: Close up shop, hire a new manager and owner and crew that will actually want to make this a downtown destination, clean up the place, have better seating, and make it worthwhile. Take pride in your food and your presentation / ambiance. People will pay for great food. 

Until then, and not that you care, I will not be back.

Unfortunately what we didn&#39;t know was that there is no table service. Just a small area with room for about 10-15 people. We ordered at the counter, sat down and proceeded to wait over 50 minutes for 1 small pizza and an order of jalapeno poppers. They didn&#39;t even offer to bring the poppers out early. No fountain drinks, which does make sense since there&#39;s practically no seating, so we paid for cans of Coke as needed. The worst part of the evening was the single stand-up coin-op video game that blared the same sound effect every 6 seconds. Some other patrons asked the counter worker to turn it off but they said they didn&#39;t know how. 10 times a minute times 50 minutes of waiting means we heard that 500 times before we even got our food.

My fiancée &amp; I moved to Aurora a couple of months ago, &amp; after moving for the better part of the day, we were getting hungry, so I suggested Doughball&#39;s.

My fiancée called back a few hours later to place the actual order &amp; the person on the other end of the phone gave him a hard time about placing the order because of the address, even though I&#39;d called before to ask. 

As soon as my fiancée got the words out to confirm the order, the person on the other end of the phone hung up on him. It was a Friday night &amp; busy, I&#39;m sure, but it was rude &amp; a lousy impression to make on customers who wanted to give you business.

Lol. That&#39;s a bit comic I know. But in all seriousness, this place was AWFUL about a year ago. Terrible. And when I say terrible, I mean T-E-R-R-I-B-L-E. To the full extent of the word. I even once asked the guy working &#34;How are you guys still in business?&#34;. Okay, I know that sounds rude and obnoxious, but seriously this place was an embarrassment! I had already decided I&#39;d never step foot inside this place again.

FORTUNATELY, a heaven sent owner took over. And let me tell you, as soon as you walk in you can tell the difference(if you&#39;d been here before). Now the place looks like somewhere nice to have a slice of pizza. Now it&#39;s clean. Now the staff cares. I happened to be craving a slice of pizza late one night and I remembered they were opened, my partner convinced me to go and so I did. Only to be surprised! The guy that rang us up for 2 ready to go slices was so nice I said to him WOW did this place get a new owner or something? And he said yes, and I said Really!? Who!? And he said, You&#39;re looking at him. How great was this! I immediately praised him. Go him! He told me all about the changes he was working on and how much work it was going to take him to bring people back because he was aware of the terrible service that was there. I know that with his attitude he&#39;ll definitely be the change Doughballs desperately needed.

Give them a chance! Support local businesses. Plus, it&#39;s pizza, who doesn&#39;t love pizza!?"

Figured that 7:30 on a Saturday night would be busy. We walked in and the place was dead. The interior does not give off a positive vibe. It&#39;s extremely cramped and plain with only a few tables and chairs which was a surprise compared to the awesome decorations outside. The place is connected to another restaurant and there were multiple people coming in and asking directions and going through a door right where we were sitting. There was no music and being the only ones there with the staff felt very awkward. Staff was friendly enough just seemed like they had nothing to do. We decided to take the food back to the hotel since the atmosphere felt so off. Quite a long wait for a small size pizza and an order of doughballs. The pizza itself was amazing and our order of Parmesan doughballs were just eh. Should have tried the sugar kind. #regrets 
*would definitely order the pizza again but understand why no one else was actually dining there."

They&#39;re long. And the location is not too convenient. Lots of one-ways near a casino means trouble for my terrible driving skills. However this last Saturday they delivered a pizza a full 45 minutes early, so that&#39;s a definite &#34;thank you!&#34; from me.

The person at the counter that took our order was very friendly, but he seemed distracted and scatter brained.  We ordered a 14&#34; pepperoni, and I asked for it to be sliced in pie slices, and it came out in square slices - Not a huge deal, but the person at the counter said every time someone orders it in pie slices, it never comes out in pie slices.  

We also ordered the fried mac and cheese bites, and they didn&#39;t come out.  We reminded the server, and he got them, and they came out hot and were very good, but it took about ten minutes after we got our pizza.

We also ordered the cinnamon and sugar dough balls, and they weren&#39;t very good at all.

One really funny/interesting thing about the visit, was that about half the time there was no one attending the front counter or phone.  Some people walked in, and then left.  When the server showed up, he asked us where the people went.  Also, at about 5PM on a Saturday, the guy answered the phone, and told the people who had called that they were all out of pizza for the rest of the night.  He said, &#34;I think we&#39;re out of pizza for the rest of the night. Sorry dude.&#34;

Pretty much every interaction we had or witnessed between the server and customers concluded with an apology, &#34;Dude&#34;.

Overall, the experience was not pleasant, and we won&#39;t be returning.  I&#39;d also recommend the employees lay off the recreational &#34;oregano&#34;."

The pizza was not quite upto the hype.  Very little sauce and the outer edge of the crust was very bland.  They give you sides of barbecue sauce and ranch but that still did not help with the pizza.  

As for the doughballs I do not know where to start.  They deserve all 2 of the stars on this review.  I have not had an appetizer with that much flavor.  If I knew they tasted that good I would of bought 2-3 orders of them.  If I am ever in Aurora again I would definitely go back for the Parmesan doughballs and knowing how good they are, I would but the cinnamon doughballs as well.

The delivery wait time is ridiculousssss. Both times we have ordered from here, it has taken around 90 minutes to 2 HOURS for our pizza to come. That is insane!

We got the Veggie Monster Pizza and an order of garlic doughballs.  The pizza was pretty good.  The sauce was very flavorful and the veggies were plentiful.  For some reason my veggie hating-toddler will eat vegetables when they are on pizza, so this pizza went over well with him.  I personally think the pizza could use a little more cheese and of course my East Coast self likes a chewier crust.  However, we liked the pizza enough to consider ordering it again.  

But I have to say I totally agree with Steve M.&#39;s review regarding the doughballs.  They were inedible in my opinion.  We ended up throwing out the whole order.  I feel like they have potential but they need to cut WAY back on the butter.  I felt like I was eating a stick of butter plain -- not a good thing :("

He witnessed the driver run into our garage, deliver our pizza, and leave. The driver never mentioned hitting our door. We immediately called Doughballs, as well as file a police report. The manager on duty apologized and said the owner will contact us. 

Two days later &amp; we have still not heard from the owner - the police were able to find out the drivers information and we are getting our garage replaced no issues, but as a customer I expected the owner to still contact us and offer an apology on behalf of the company.

We needed to eat in and not carry out but called ahead and they told us they have a table with two chairs and a couch. We decided to give it a try.

They have a great menu and creative options. We ordered a pizza, fried pickles, and used the Yelp check-in offer for a free order of doughballs. Everything came out at the same time and they put everything in to-go containers and didn&#39;t give us napkins or plastic silverware or paper plates or anything. I guess they really aren&#39;t an eat-in place. :) 

The fried pickles were good and came with a side of ranch. I think there were five of them. 

We didn&#39;t try any of their clever pizzas and instead got one with marinara, mozzarella and bacon. I could NOT believe how good it was! I was so pleasantly surprised. I loved it. The sauce was incredible. I really liked the crust- thin, pretty crisp, with great taste. The pizza was less crisp in the middle but the edges were perfect (my husband liked the center pieces). I loved the flavor of the pizza and spent the rest of the night reminding my husband how much I loved it. We had a lot left over and it reheated well the next two days. 

We got the cinnamon sugar doughballs and my husband went NUTS over them. They came with a little thing of frosting and he ate them one after another and ate the rest for breakfast the next day. I didn&#39;t care for them but got a kick out of how much he liked them.

This was my first (and probably last) time at Doughballs. I ordered the Mac and Cheese Pizza and the Diet Zone calzone for carryout.
The calzone was &#34;meh, I&#39;ve had better&#34;. The pizza was kind of terrible.
Worst part is, after waiting for over an hour for our order (that part I don&#39;t mind so much), the pizza that we were given wasn&#39;t very hot. In the 15 minutes that it took for us to reach home, the pizza had reached room temperature or was lukewarm at best.

Quite disappointing..."

It is difficult to park near this restaurant.  Once getting inside the employee working was not the most attentive person. There wasn&#39;t a single person in there from the time we arrived to the time we finished eating and left.  There really is not much seating and what is there is very uncomfortable.  It took forever to get our food. The doughballs were not very good. The pizza was pretty terrible honestly. There was an inch of standing grease on the crust. It did not taste very good and it was just a mess to attempt to eat it.  I had 2 of the tiny triangle corner pieces and gave up. My husband and dad tried to finish the pizza and doughballs.  It was excessively salty and greasy it just gave me a stomach ache.  I used to make pizzas by hand in a pizza place years ago so I have some knowledge on the matter.  Not so great.

My wife and two young kids had lunch today on a Saturday at 1:30pm.  We love ultra casual cheap eats places like this, but our experience won&#39;t have us running back anytime soon.

We ordered two slices of pizza - cheese and sausage.  In addition, we ordered the garlic dough balls, an order of fries and 2 sodas.  Total came to $20.  The pizza came from a rotating heat lamp counter top display case, and was not hot.  I was surprised that the slices were not tossed back in the oven for 2 minutes as many places like this would do that to ensure that the product is fresh (Sbarro&#39;s does it this way, so do a number of pizza slice joints in Chicago).  The pizza itself had a great flavor and is definitely thin New York style, but it&#39;s not very good when they are cool and don&#39;t come out looking and tasting fresh.  The slices are big and the size of your head.

The fries and dough balls were made to order and arrived hot after a few minutes.  Nothing memorable about either, perhaps I should have purchased a dipping sauce for the dough balls.

The man who took our order and rang us up came across as being uninterested (we&#39;re not looking for any special attention or service -- really -- we realize this is pizza slice joint).  It took a while (like 2 minutes) for anyone to notice that we entered the restaurant and were waiting at the counter.  That&#39;s also after shouting back a few times.  Perhaps the cook was the one running the register?  After everything was rung up, the credit card machine was not working and we were asked to pay cash.  I still don&#39;t know if they take credit cards or not as I did see a credit card terminal next to the register. My wife and I accumulated what we had in our pockets and completed the sale.

I originally wanted a slice of the mac and cheese pizza (I seriously had my heart set on this and it was one of the main reasons for going), and only could order slices from the counter display (although I could have bought a whole mac and cheese pie). We saw some specialty slices (there was something with fries on it, also something with tomatoes) but they looked so old and frumpy in the display.  We defaulted to the cheese and sausage.

There is an area where you can dine in, perhaps 12 seats are available.  The lights were off in this area and it just felt desolate sitting there by ourselves.  I went back to the counter to purchase another soda and it took a while for the clerk to hear me shout back to the kitchen, so the same routine started over again.

Later during the meal, we looked for napkins, forks and knives and could not find them anywhere, and I did not want to go back to the counter again to wait.  At the end of my meal I also noticed that we were charged for two slices of sausage instead of one, and I did not want to deal with it (whatever the price difference is between sausage and cheese).

I think this place might be better in the evening, perhaps catering to the late night crowd.  My wife and I are very easy to accommodate and are not very picky, it just seems like they need to get some basic things in place here.  Also, they don&#39;t have a high chair or booster seat, so don&#39;t bring young kids.

I hate leaving these types of reviews, really.  For $20 we could have had so much better here - or elsewhere - for the same money."

My favorite pizza place in the Western suburbs. The Cuervo is delish: thinly sliced mozzarella and fresh tomato over an olive oil, salt, and pepper crust. The crust is delicious, it&#39;s thin and Italian style.

The 14&#34; was around $17 and change. Not bad for a full of flavor pie. Just how I want it.

It&#39;s a small take out place, with a lot of humor and good conversation while you wait. There&#39;s only enough room to order a slice or two or pick up and carry out.

Had an 18&#34; half cheese for the kids and half caramelized onions and roasted garlic for me and the misses.

Pizza was great. For a crust of that style, I wouldn&#39;t have minded it a bit crispier, but I did pick it up 15 minutes late or so, so it may have been better if I&#39;d been more prompt.

But the sauce was tasty, cheese was very good (I find that&#39;s one of the things that makes the most difference between a really good pizza and a boring pizza) and the onion/garlic combo was out of  this world!

Also tried an order of bosco sticks and an order of sweet potato tots. Both were tasty. The sweet potato tots were almost more of a desert, very sweet and served with a cup of something like cinnamon roll icing. Tasty, though I was expecting something more along the lines of a sweet potato fry one might dip in ketchup.

Used the $30 for $20 coupon from the top of the Yelp page so it was reasonably priced too, and they staple some actually worthwhile coupons to the box too. All in all, I&#39;m pretty sure we&#39;ll be back soon."

The crust has like a buttery taste. The texture of pita bread if you were to put it in the toaster. I ate my way through half a cheese pizza before I realized it- its really good pizza. I think we&#39;ve found our new pizza place! :D"

Instead of the basic ingredients, they also have mac and cheese pizza, philly steak pizza, popeye pizza, etc. My boyfriend got a slice of the cheese pizza and he said it was less than great. I got a spinach, chicken, mushroom and mozzerella calzone. It would&#39;ve been fine, but they forgot the cheese. I would not order a calzone again. The dough for the crust was good, but I prefer calzones from Pockets. Fred also got fried ravioli. The fried ravioli was probably my favorite item we ordered. It was a little spicier than I am used to, but delicious nonetheless. *I also noticed they are open until 3 am on Friday and Saturday nights..which makes it perfect for business leaving Ballydoyle&#39;s at 2 am*."

My husband is a vegetarian so we ordered a Veggie Monster with a side of Parmesan Doughballs and cinnamon sugar Doughballs (with the $30 for $20 deal through Yelp). The Parmesan Doughballs were only OK, they were very heavy and I was hoping they would have been lighter, but that may have just been my expectation. We ordered 6 and got 10, so that was nice. And honestly, the next day they were pretty darn good microwaves (definitely better the second time around). The Veggie Monster Pizza was only alright, it needed some salt and maybe so more flavorful cheese. Next time we will definitely build our own pizza, or I would go back with a meat eater to try one of the others. The cinnamon Doughballs were great- basically a cinnamon dough nut (actually, exactly the same as the cinnamon dough nuts from Ballydoyle, which I guess shouldn&#39;t have surprised me - I think they have the same owner). All in all, the experience was OK, but would try a different pizza next time, and probably skip the Parmesan balls."

I didn&#39;t like it, and they cared. Deeply. Very shortly after I posted my disappointed review, I was contacted by two different people who apologized for my experience. Both were professional and genuine. They assured me that my experience was atypical and promised to follow up with their staff to make sure that the problem would not happen again. They encouraged me to give them another shot, so I did. In the evening this time, just in case. 

The person taking our order was friendly and efficient. The pizzas were ready when my husband arrived to pick them up. We ordered a Philinator and a plain cheese pizza. I was intrigued by the idea of the Philinator. French fries on a pizza sounded like a potential disaster, but for some reason, I couldn&#39;t look away. I had to give it a try. Doughballs pulled it off well. Even after traveling a few blocks to the car and then another 10 minutes before arriving on my plate, the pizza was still nice and hot. The flavors came together pretty well. I felt like it was undersalted until I added the cheese dipping sauce that comes with it. Then it all made sense. The only thing I would change is to add a little more seasoning to the beef - the flavor got lost a bit with the onion sauce. It wasn&#39;t bad, though - it just made the beef on the pizza easier to miss with all of the other things going on. The red peppers were fresh and delightful. I would order that pizza again - it is a nice guilty pleasure 

The cheese pizza was fine. They sprinkle the oregano pretty liberally, which I think is why my kids weren&#39;t all that into the pizza (they didn&#39;t mind the Philinator, though, that&#39;s for sure - next time, we&#39;re just getting two of those). It was great the next day, too.   

I really like the texture of Doughballs&#39; crusts. If it were up to me, I&#39;d add a little salt to the dough. Then again, this might interfere with some of the more inventive topping combinations they offer. Guess I&#39;ll have to try more of their specialty pizzas so I can come up with a truly informed verdict. We&#39;ll stick with the evenings, in case the timing of the order added to our improved experience."

I was visiting my sister at the time so wasn&#39;t  familiar with my options around here in Naperville, IL so I came across this place and since Yelp seemed to give them good reviews we gave it a chance. 

I was skeptical since the restaurant was only a one dollar sign and this may make a difference in the quality of food, but was not the case here! We ordered 20 enchiladas to go with rice and beans on the side. The food was excellent and the chicken in our enchiladas was perfect! 

We had 20 of us over for dinner and everyone enjoyed the food and will definitely go back again for more. I give this place 4 out of 5 just because they lady who took our order was a little frustrated with us since we had changed up the trays amount of enchiladas.

Totopos is tiny with only three tables, but I was able to get one, and a busy take out service.  Just walking through the front door, I knew this was going to be good.  Although tiny, the place was nicely decorated and felt immediately cozy.   I was in a hurry so I ordered a seasoned pork Buritto combo which just means it included the drink in the $6.99 price. The Burrito is listed as a &#34;medium&#34; Buritto and that is just what it was.  So many places feel that quantity beats quality and load up Burritos with tons of lettuce.  Totopos Burrito was a perfect combination of meat and other items and just right for a meal.   Plus, it tasted amazing with the two sauces offered on the table.

The waitress, which I&#39;m assuming is related to the chefs, didn&#39;t really talk much or answer any of the questions that I had when I asked them...which was awkward. The way they serve salsa is in ketchup or mustard containers (ya know, where the little cap has a hole in it?) and I sat at the table staring at the chips because I thought salsa was coming...which was SUPER awkward. 

BUT, then the food came out, and all of the awkward just melted away. The Quesadilla was amaaaaazing. Perfectly melted cheese, perfect temperature, tasted perfect. I also had some enchiladas which was also way better than I had expected. The chips that were serves with the awkward salsa were good, I just wish they would have actually had salsa in a bowl.

The woman who took my order (same lady as last time, I believe who made it, too) was so damn friendly. She even made small talk while I was deciding what to order. I loved her, she definitely made me feel welcome.

I ventured off my usual beaten path and tried a gordita today (pastor, no tomato).  This isn&#39;t your Taco Bell gordita; this thing is deep fried but still slightly soft.  The meat was pretty good but I&#39;m picky when it comes to al pastor and theirs was just a bit bland for my liking. I suppose when you&#39;re used to places like Zacatacos (Berwyn) and Los Burritos Tapatios (Glen Ellyn) that heavily season their meats, it&#39;s difficult to be fair when it comes to flavor. Other than that, the lettuce was fresh, and the incorporation of the cheese and sour cream were spot on. The rice was good, despite the vegetables as I mentioned in my original review.

1 star for half of my order tasting ok/good

I figured since its cinco de mayo and I didn&#39;t feel like cooking I would try a new mexican restaurant. I looked up the reviews for this place and figured I should at least give it a try. The second I walked in I felt claustrophobic. This place is not really big enough to be a restaurant. There is one table that seats 4 and unfortunately the only standing room to wait for your carryout is in the same general area. The party of 4 that was there (while 4 other people and myself stood around waiting for food) looked a little uncomfortable. There is one other table by the window but it seats only 2. There are 2 tiny tables outside on the sidewalk, each with 2 chairs. The girl at the register who took my order was very nice. There is no menu before you get up to the counter and no online menus at least I didn&#39;t find any. It was fairly clean inside. Now, having grown up in a mexican family (my grandparents were from Mexico) I expect authenticity when I order mexican food...especially if you have a sign that says &#34;authentic mexican cuisine&#34;. I ordered food for 4 people. Tacos all around. Only 2 types...steak and chorizo. I also ordered a side of guacamole, chips and salsa...I guess there was a miscommunication when the girl asked me if I wanted salsa for my chips and I said yes and said can I also get some salsa verde too (which is green salsa you put on your food not dip chips in). When I got home I saw they gave me a giant container of &#34;salsa verde&#34; and no salsa for the chips. And 3 little ketchup containers with guacamole...made no sense! Anyway, the &#34;salsa verde looked creamy and not like authentic salsa verde looks so I right away thought ok this shoukd be interesting. I dipped a chip in it to taste it and wow did it taste sweet! I did not expect that! And it was not good as all. Where was the spice and seasoning? First off I&#39;m 99% sure there was green apple in it. I make a lot of juices with green apple as a base so I would recognize it! On top of that I tasted no jalapeno but saw seeds, and could really taste a lot of tomatillos. Then I tried a bit of the chorizo tacos and they were ok. For sure a type of homemade chorizo. The guacamole was good I&#39;ll give them that...but you go to a mexican place expecting that. The steak tacos were awful! I don&#39;t know if the meat was bad or if they marinated the meat in something sweet but it had such a weird taste and smell! I couldn&#39;t eat mine and one of my kids ate half of one of theirs. I usually get steak tacos or a steak torta the first time I try a place because I believe if your most expensive meat is not good then I don&#39;t even want to try anything else. I only tried this place since it seems most taco places around here are going down on meat quality but raising prices are happening more frequently."

As my orders were being prepared a police officer came in to order some tacos.  As she was approaching the counter she noticed a customer who said to her as he looked up at her, &#34;The food is very good here.&#34;  The police officer said , &#34;I know you.&#34;  Turned out they both were at the same physical therapy place, the officer for a rotator cuff and he for his back.  

Just then the owner told me she made me chicken quesadillas by mistake.  I told her why waste the chicken, and asked if she could add some veggies and she said yes and added spinach.  

&#34;The chicken was fresh, which was unusual for a semi-fast food place,&#34;   said my better half and I agree on both counts. The Chicken Quesadillas were amazing.  It was ten bucks for both orders.

We&#39;ll be back for sit down though this is primarily a take out place. Why sit down?  It&#39;s such a happy place...and did I mention the food?"

The tacos are medium-ish in size, so you might have to order 3 or 4 if you want that pleasant &#34;I&#39;m full felling&#34;. Try the soy chorizo, it&#39;s actually amazing. Each taco was flavorful and unique. Not a bad bite in the bunch!

We almost always get the steak tacos or the steak burrito.  The steak is always cooked to perfection.  We love the fresh verde sauce and the smokiness of the red chipotle sauce.  They&#39;re great together!

I arrived shortly after they opened to pick up some lunch.  The two ladies working here were very friendly, and it appeared they were just starting their food prep for the day.  One lady was hard at work mashing avocados and making guacamole.

There are three tables in here, but since they hadn&#39;t started cooking, it was pretty chilly.  The interior of the restaurant is clean, and the ladies were happy to seat me or pack my order to go.  So, I took my order of two tacos to-go.

I tried the Asada (steak) taco and a chicken taco, both with cilantro &amp; onion.  The steak was really good, but my favorite was the chicken.  The chicken was tender and well-seasoned.  I topped both of my tacos with their green salsa - other Yelpers weren&#39;t joking about this stuff, it&#39;s great!  The red salsa was too smoky for my tastes, but that&#39;s okay, I went to town with the green salsa.

I also had the chips and guacamole.  As she handed me my bag, she smiled and said, &#34;homemade and fresh!&#34; The guacamole was definitely fresh and creamy, but it was a little bland.  It needed more jalapeno, cilantro, and lime.  But if you don&#39;t like spicy guac, this might just be right up your alley.

They also serve the best damn Horchata in town.  And it&#39;s ICE COLD.

I spent about $9 on my lunch, and it was worth every penny."

They don&#39;t have a public restroom, which I dont really care about, but its a complaint I hear often when I am eating there. The tacos and entree dishes are HUGE. We ordered 2 main dishes and a large quesadilla between 2 people and we could barely finish it. The rice was a style of mexican rice where theres corn and carrots in it, which tasted so moist. The Carne Asada in the tacos is a bit dry but perfect with the avocado crema and salsa on top of it. The chicken was the same thing, but a little more moist.

Yes, Totopos is tiny and has limited seating for dining in, as others have pointed out, and yes, it may take a bit longer for them to prepare your food than it takes the place next door to slap some second-rate deli meats on a Wonder Bread sub roll, but the food here is fresh, well prepared, authentic and tasty. And the ladies that prepare the food and take your order at the counter are very nice. 

It&#39;s a bit of a drive for me as a lunch spot but I still find excuses to go here; that&#39;s how much I like the food. Dishes sampled thus far include chicken tacos (flavorful and moist) and barbacoa tacos (very, very good). On my last visit I struck up a conversation with a lady who was waiting for her to-go order, and so I asked about her favorites. &#34;Shrimp Tacos, hands down&#34; was her immediate reply, &#34;In fact, they&#39;re so good I have never thought to try anything else&#34; she added.

My co-workers and I could not find a menu online so we went on yelp and kinda just went through the pictures to get an idea on menu and prices. We placed 4 orders total. My co-workers went to go pick up our food. There was a line out the door which caused them to come back really late. My co-worker warned me that I may be a little upset about my meal costing $13! I got combo #6 and an Horchata. The picture I had seen said the combo was $6.99 ( apparently that was the price 3yrs ago!) 

Any who, they returned with our food and guess who&#39;s order was missing?? Mine! They missed my entrée along with getting a side order for one of my co-workers wrong. So here I go wasting my time on a trip I was trying to avoid to go pick up my food. As soon as I called they knew they messed up. They didn&#39;t even include limes or salsas.

My food was ready when I got there thankfully there wasn&#39;t a line. The workers were very friendly and apologized a bunch of times so I couldn&#39;t even be mad. They seemed like really nice people. They gave me a free drink as a courtesy. 

Once I got back to work and started eating my food I was happy to see that my chicken sopes were good white breast chicken. Not nasty or fatty like other places. Although the chicken was mixed with too many stringy gooey onions. So overall, their food was good but I don&#39;t know about paying that much for a lunch meal. Maybe once in a great while."

When the server lady asked us about chips, I asked if they were free, and she said yes, but who knows if she even knew what we were talking about.  Though friendly, her English was not very good.  This sort of stuff leaves a bad taste with the customer.  Besides there&#39;s nothing on the menu about it.  To boot, the chicken quesadillas we tried were quite salty, as were the pricy chips by the way.  The bread on the steak torta, while generously sized for $5.75, was not particularly fresh.

The tamales are homemade everyday and at there&#39;s a special of the day that are not the typical.  Last week it was pineapple and of course absolutely delicious.

Biggest complaint is the meat, so its a Mexican joint nobody is expecting super quality beef. I have found the meat is incredibly dry here.

I ordered the chicken taco meal and sat down. It was just the two of us. It felt as though I was at her house. I watch her make the food as if she was in her own kitchen - measuring, spooning the ingredients...she brought me my lunch and the 2 sauces.

The green sauce - I will have to BUY this! It made the tacos 10 times better! (Not that they needed them) I didn&#39;t leave one grain of rice or taco crumb. Yes, it was that good!As I finished up, there seem to be a lot of regulars streaming in. They asked what tamales she was making this week.

Good, authentic Mexican food - carne asada tacos were delicious. Chips and salsa (which were not free) weren&#39;t worth the $, in my opinion. We are maybe 5 chips. Very small place, only three or four tables, the restaurant must do mostly carry outs. I probably wouldn&#39;t return if I were in the area, only because of the atmosphere and no alcohol served."

We are avid Mexican food fans, and I personally have grown up around authentic Mexican food in Chicago my whole life. So we sit down and start with chips and guac. The guac was alright, definitely lacked flavor, we both agreed it was good, but was missing something (onions? light jalapenos?). Our waiter then came up to take our dinner order and my wife ordered 2 carne asada tacos- I on the other hand could not make up my mind, everything sounded so good, so I asked the waiter what he suggested. He strongly suggested the steak torta, so I agreed. 

When we got our food, my wife really enjoyed the 2 tacos and said the tortilla had a good texture (sometimes they can be too crispy or too soggy). I loaded up one half of my torta with their salsa verde (which was exceptionally good), and took my first bite. Overall I thought it was good, but just pretty average. I did notice that there was a tortilla cut in half on my sandwich, which I&#39;ve never seen before, and felt that was a little unnecessary and made it too bready. The steak itself was tender but had a light breading to it, almost like milanesa, but just not as fried- wasn&#39;t expecting that. I did try the salsa roja on the other half, and I must say that it was the best salsa roja I ever had- smokey, spicy, salty... it was great.

Overall not a bad little place, I&#39;d go there again if I was in the area, but I&#39;m not so sure I&#39;d make a special trip from Wheaton again. If this place can give more attention to the people dining in (especially because there&#39;s only 3 tables in the store), I think I would have given 4 stars."

I went with my family for lunch midweek. The place was busy, but we got a table and the server came and took our order. Then it went downhill.....

It took 30 minutes to get out food! I understand quality takes time but I saw them cook my tortas sandwich and it looked like pre cooked meat from Tupperware. My sons chicken taco came burnt, he didn&#39;t want to eat it. After waiting so long for food, I see my server leaving. WTF? 

Then I had to cut the line to ask another employee for the check. Shouldn&#39;t another server check on us? I understand its a small establishment but focus on your customer. After waiting and asking for it twice, I left with my son and my husband had to wait for the check. Definitely not going back. Sorry Totopos!"

I was looking at the menu and wanted to try this thing (don&#39;t remember what it is called - SORRY) that looked like a Mexican burger.  It was on a bun, had shredded cheese and onions, avocado and some smoked pepper.  I HATED it.  Not only was it sort of bland, but the smoked pepper gave it this awful flavor that I just wasn&#39;t a fan of.  I think I just ordered the wrong thing though and will totally come here and get something that I know I will like.  This place is mostly takeout though since there are only three tables inside."

These ladies rock the house. Homemade tamales on Tuesdays?!?! DAMN GOOD! 

Their Tortas and Cemitas are worth coming back for. I enjoyed their burrito once too, but it&#39;s all about the sandwiches here. 

Barbacoa and carnitas so far are my favorite proteins they offer. Their salsas taste very authentic and are homemade. I really like the chipolte and verde, both go great on the cemitas and tortas. &#39;

Place is small, great for a quick bite or perfect for some above the line Mexican take out. 

The women running the show clearly care about their food and their customers. This will likely keep you coming back, cause it&#39;s had me in there three times this week!

The bad: Did not like that you have to pay extra for chips and salsa. Felt the woman who waited on us and seemed to be running the place was rude. Food was not as tasty as you find at some of the taquerias in Aurora and the prices were a lot higher. We were a bit shocked when we got the check.

This was the only Mexican place got 4 stars on the yelp close to route 59 so I decided to give it a try. This is a little cute place but I was disappointed with my pork Burrito to-go.

I guess they didn&#39;t cut the fat or tendon out of the pork so it was greasy and chewy. There were big chuck of onions mixed with meat which was too much for me. It was salty too. I took about two or three bites and could not convince myself to continue. 

It is very clean and bright inside with 3 small tables on the side. The lady at the register was very friendly.

Service really increased the rating as the lady was a total sweetheart throughout my transaction and she made sure that I knew what I was ordering, explaining a cemita sandwich and offering samples of each of the hot sauces.  

I got a horchata while waiting, which really came in handy while sampling the hot sauces as they really cleared my sinuses.  The taco arabe looked more like an enchilada than a taco as it was long and thin.  I&#39;m guessing its lamb or goat meat that had onions strands, very good.  The cemita has packed with lettuce, tomato, sour cream, avacado, chipotle pepper and your chosen meat, which I vied for the breaded steak (milanesa) and it fills you up nicely for the $6 something price tag.  The burrito was good but not as good as I envisioned.  It seemed pretty filler as it had quite a bit of rice inside.  

I would like to go back and try something else.  I recommend trying something else besides the burrito."

This is a small, no frills, family run place...better for carryout than for dining in, but it is absolutely worth a trip. So far, my favorite items includes their steak tacos with queso blanco, onions and cilantro but their beef barbacoa and their pork carnitas are great too, but always with their salsas.  These salsas could go head to to head with any of Rick Bayless&#39;s restaurants!

 When you walk in, half the clientele is mexican/american but the other half are those who know and seek out great food even when it is in a small strip mall like Totopos is located.

I went ahead and ordered a breaded steak torta plus horchata. The owner told me that if I were to call 30 minutes ahead she would make me hibiscus water, my favorite type of water!!!! Best owner ever!

I just finished up my torta and oh my taste buds were having a blast! The bread was soft, the steak was great, and the horchata is just like my aunts make it!

First, the place has only 3 tables.  I don&#39;t need more than one for myself, but if you&#39;re looking for a little bit of peace and quiet, you&#39;re not going to get it here.  There were 3 guys at a table next to mine- literally screaming at each other about drag racing, car modifications, etc, etc.  This discussion was way too spirited to be happening in a place this small.  Seriously,  I was beyond annoyed.  So my first tip- if you eat here, get it to go. I was going to say something they were so obnoxious, but I felt like the manager/owner could have stepped up and done that.  The other table was looking at them too.  Definitely -1 star.

Second, I ordered the chicken burrito based on the rave reviews.  I ordered the special for $6.99.  I was charged $10.24.  Why?  I don&#39;t know, but I was already in a crappy mood from the dopes arguing about racing mods at the table next to mine.  Food itself was totally average.  I mean, it was OK.  Granted the chicken was all white meat which is great (+1 star).  It was kind of small though.  I think they gave me the small burrito when I ordered the large (that I paid $10.24 for the $6.99 for).... strike 2.

Asked for chips and salsa.  Not taco sauce.  Chips came out (about 14 in a small bowl) and the owner pointed at the sauces on the table.  Was this possibly the extra $3 that appeared on my bill?  For 14 chips?  If so, then I&#39;m really, really ticked. 

I&#39;ll leave this at 2 stars and I will maybe try again.  Sorry guys, but I think everyone is giving this place WAAAAAAAYYYYYYY too much credit.  I&#39;ll stick to El Burrito Mexicano in Lisle.  In fariness I&#39;ll go back someday, but only if I can locate that missing $3 and change."

However, from the business point of view if you are gonna have tables were your costumers are gonna sit down and consume your product, you have to accommodate your costumer at least with a restroom were they can wash their hands and used while they wait for the food, instead of sending you costumers to Burger King, I came in to enjoy some food but the lady who runs the place has no idea of what costumer service is. Costumers are the key to any business, a happy costumer equals a great and successful business.  While waiting for my food there also was a guy ordering to go and the lady was being so rude to him, is because of consumers that she is able to have business. She definitely needs to learn business and costumers 101.   The lady who runs the place is also rude to her own employees as well.

Offers the very rare dinner special with plenty of food plus an egg roll, choice of white or chicken fried rice and choice of soup (egg drop or hot and sour). You could dispense with the soup (though I wouldn&#39;t) and get a can of soda instead.

This is a very small place - four tables max, and more than one are two-tops. The kitchen is pretty small too. The guys working here are really earning their pay. They&#39;re constantly on the move. The counter service was friendly and helpful during the ordering process.

The food:

Chicken with cashew nut: 
Lots of veggies in this one. My mom enjoyed it quite a bit. The chicken was some shade of otherworldly pale white. I&#39;m guessing it was poached???

Mongolian Beef: 
My dad enjoyed the flavor of this dish and was overwhelmed by the portion size (dinner special). He did comment that the beef was a little bit tough &amp; dry.

General&#39;s Chicken: 
This is one of my guilty pleasures. Even so, I do have an ideal version in my mind that I compare versions of this dish to. I liked the flavors of this dish, but the very best General Tso&#39;s chicken retains some of its fried crunch. In this one, there was no contrast in texture, really. 

Hot and Sour Soup: 
Really nice version here. Served piping hot. I really enjoyed the flavor and will always go for this option on the lunch or dinner specials menu.

Egg Roll: 
Couldn&#39;t find room for this during the meal. So much freaking food. I&#39;ll eat it tomorrow so I can see what besides cabbage is inside. Dad liked his. [edit: Ate the egg roll the next day, and I was not impressed. Mostly cabbage filling --everything else inside was unidentifiable except for a micro shrimp. For a better take on egg rolls, take Cass into downtown Westmont and look for China Chef on the west side of the street. Their egg rolls are really huge and TDF. /edit]

App: Hot Chicken Wings
Well, mixed results on the wings. On the plus side, they were nicely fried, came straight out of the fryer - so you&#39;ll be sure to have them hot if your trip home is short. The skin texture had plenty of crunch. On the negative side, despite the usual tell-tale sign of red pepper seeds, there was virtually no heat. I was tempted to walk over to Popeye&#39;s and get a few packets of Louisiana style hot sauce. They would have been perfect.

App: Crab Rangoon
They used the less common flat presentation versus the more common four petal version. I thought they had a nice flavor - could taste the scallions. As others have noted-not quite as sweet as many Crab Rangoon. I think it&#39;s for the better.

All in all, a fine carry-out place. The lunch special is a killer value, and the dinner special is too (though not quite to the same extent). Recommended."

I placed a delivery order and saw on the website there&#39;s a coupon for free crab rangoon if you order $20 or more. The gentleman that took my order informed me that my order was not $20 but he told me that he would give me the free Crab Rangoon anyway. Thank you ! 
after about  45 minutes, My food arrived pretty hot , the crab rangoon is ok not the best but not the worst. 

I had the basil fried rice with tofu, the portion is big and they gave me a lot of tofu pieces !!!! 

The pad see ew is pretty decent too ! 

Both of the items has good flavors but it&#39;s not the same like the food you get from really good Thai restaurants. Definitely pass for great Chinese takeout!! Oh ! and I&#39;m pretty happy with their customer service!!!!

They have solid shrimp fried rice with a decent amount of veggies and little shrimp.  I prefer this preparation.  I don&#39;t like it when there are 3 large shrimp on top cause I want to get shrimp on each bite.  The pot stickers are ginormous but tasty.  The Singapore noodles were dry and not that spicy so I&#39;d stay away from those.  But if you&#39;re like me and like veggies and small shrimp in your fried rice, this is a good spot."

......because they would&#39;ve fallen tragically short.  2 decidedly sub-par breakfasts in just as many days tells me that maybe I ought to stop going out for morning meals.  Seriously.

Coming here on a Sunday at 10am means that the kitchen should be on top of their game, as the church-going crowd packs the restaurant.  We had to wait a minimal amount of time to be seated, but there was no where to sit/wait so people loitered around awkwardly.

Once we got seated, we put in an order for a chocolate milkshake and banana smoothie.  Although the choco shake was only just so-so (made with syrup), my banana smoothie was pleasantly refreshing.  Our waitress took our food order and it was shortly after that I noticed something I&#39;ve never before seen in a restaurant.  And it wasn&#39;t good.

As I went to take a sip of water, I saw some unusual residue on the edge of my glass.  At first glance I thought it was lipstick from a previous customer, but upon closer inspection, it was determined to be lip gloss (Caty D confirmed this).  Not mine, nor hers, but someone else&#39;s.  WHAT THE ACTUAL FUDGE.  &#34;Well now hang on a minute Eric, are you sure it was lip gloss?&#34;  Let&#39;s examine the facts: it was on the rim of a glass, and when I scratched it off with my nail my finger became all beige and sparkley.  Yes, I&#39;m 100% positive it was lip gloss.

I politely told our waitress and she brought me a new one.  In my mind, I rationalized that elevating the situation to a manager or taking a picture of the nastiness and uploading it to social media wouldn&#39;t solve anything, so I left the issue alone.  Also because I&#39;m a non-confrontational guy.  Still, though.  Major WTF moment.  Never encountered that in all my travels.

Eventually the food arrived and we stuffed our faces.  Her Tex-mex wrap appeared fine (even though it was mostly potatoes), and my eggs benedict came loaded with ham, bacon, and chorizo.  I probably would&#39;ve eaten more if I wasn&#39;t so off-put by the lipgloss incident.  Whatever.  My plate came with hash browns, which looked and tasted like mostly-raw potato shreds.  The &#39;tatoes must have spent no more than 30 seconds on the griddle since not a single one was properly cooked.  Hash browns are one of my favorite breakfast staples, so when places screw them up I can&#39;t help but feel disappointed.

Bread = 2.5
Circuses = 1.5

It bothers me that the yokels in the kitchen have the audacity to serve me what they deemed &#34;hash browns&#34; (as they were much closer to &#39;hash whites&#39;).  To compound matters, lip gloss on a water glass is about as class-less as you can get.  If human dishwashers are used, fire them.  If mechanical dishwashers are used, buy new ones.  Because whatever cleaning/sterilizing system you have in place, that sh*t ain&#39;t working!

So nope, I can&#39;t in good conscience recommend.  But your Eggsperience may vary."

When we left, the hostess was shocked we were walking out and asked what was wrong. 
How is it safe for the people working in this restaurant to be working in such conditions? Why were there no notices on the door, or fans to try to cool the place off?

It had been months since we had been there so we decided to have breakfast there yesterday (5/20). There was a total of 5 of us...4 adults and 1 child. We were seated right away since they weren&#39;t busy. The wait usually isn&#39;t too long on busy days. Our waitress was very nice and brought all our drinks right away. I ordered my usual, the chorizo omelette which is pretty big so I split it with one of the adults (it also comes with e decent sized serving of hashbrowns and pancakes or toast. Two adults got skillets and the child got scrambled eggs with bacon. I also ordered a white chocolate mocha from here since they are tasty and they use Ghirardelli white chocolate. 

The food was slightly off this day. The chorizo omelette did taste good but had a bit too much cheese this time. The pancakes that came with my order were a little hard and not fluffy. The child loved her food. And the two adults who had skillets loved their food. Just as we were all almost done eating one of the adults in our party found a hair in his skillet! He suddenly felt sick since he had eaten almost all of the skillet and wondered if there was anything else he possibly ate in there. The waitress came over to check on us and he told her what he found and she was so nice and apologized and went to tell the manager. She came back over and said the manager would do 50% off his skillet which I mean he was almost done with it so I suppose thats fair.

Aside from the hair I would say we had a pleasant experience there. Maybe they have new cooks? Not sure why the food was tasting a little off that day."

On a weekend, while we appreciated getting sat right away but cant make it up for lack of customer services.  Took the waiting staff awhile to greet us and get us the menus...Coffee was warm, I understand you may afraid if the coffee too burning hot I may sue but really?  warm coffee and we asked a glass of water with no ice but both glasses of water came with alot of ice!

I ordered Egg Benedict and the eggs were poached hard and extra fruit bowl had moldy strawberries.

The sever was nice but was no where to be found and when she returned she blamed her tardiness on other guests &#34;talking too much&#34;.  I never had a chance to even tell her the issues.   So when I went to pay the bill they asked &#34;How was everything?&#34; and I told them.  They said &#34;Oh, did you tell the sever?&#34;.

Atmosphere-there is none. The place looks dirty and there is no rhyme or reason to the layout. 

So I get seated in a very small little corner next to the loudest group of 5 teenagers...who were dropping F-Bombs ever 2 seconds...they were so loud...I could actually tell you the conversation this boy had with his crew. 

The waitress is crabby and has an attitude...the manager was yelling at her to clean off a table before I  was seated (like right in front of me)...

The Food-Gross... I ordered a skillet, I&#39;ve never met a skillet I didn&#39;t like until I ate this one. There was all this runny juice at the bottom of the skillet...so it made my potatoes soggy...onions were undercooked...half of my potatoes were burned...the other half was raw inside but burnt on the outside? What, what? 

The bathroom is Dirty...the door on the stalls looked like they were about to fall down. Cracked tiles everywhere...just disgusting. 

Try Butterfields you&#39;ll have a better experience.

It was early, around 8:00am and we decided to check this place out. The place was already packed and we were hesitant to even go in because I didn&#39;t feel like waiting with an almost 2 year old to eat, but surprisingly we were sat as soon as we walked in. 
As much as we appreciated getting sat right away, it didn&#39;t make up for the lack of customer service and friendliness. We never got menus and the girl that sat us said nothing more than follow me with a typical spoiled Napervillian tone. 
When our server came we asked for menus, which she returned with two. Mind you, we had our almost 2 year old daughter, and we weren&#39;t given a kids menu, which we knew they clearly had. Whatever. 
My wife ordered an egg white omelet, I went with the chocolate chip pancakes, and we ordered the mickey mouse pancakes for the little one. Also got 2 coffees and an orange juice. The food came out in an appropriate amount of time and the food was just okay. The omelets looked huge, but my wife mentioned that it was lack luster on the flavor and seemed dry. The chocolate chip pancakes were sad. They were just plain pancakes with mini chocolate chips thrown on top. This stinks because after the top pancake, there are no other chocolate chips in the stack...
Everything is overpriced, which is kinda expected in Naperville, but it&#39;s totally not worth it. Bleh, we won&#39;t go back. There are plenty of other places around that are much better."

The one in Naperville, is loud, bright and busy! Obviously successful and yet it was only my first time here. What&#39;s up with that?

The food is very good, Almost Red Apple (Carol Stream) good, but not quite.

We took our amazing almost 1 year old grandson there and were very pleased with how well we were treated and how friendly the staff was.

The baby got the food that we brought with us, just for him.

They bring a small pot of coffee for the table, it&#39;s decent coffee and I like the pot concept.. except when you run out. But there&#39;s plenty of staff around to get you more... 

I ordered The Cook&#39;s Calling omelette, in other places this would be referred to as the butcher something, or the meat lovers.. They bake their omelettes so that they are light and fluffy, mine was.. and even better.. my cheese oozed! I love it when my cheese oozes. The omelette was filled adequately with meat products and very good tasting, I like their hash browns, they make them fresh and cook them crispy on the outside while keeping them soft inside.. nicely done. 

Lisa had the Denver omelette, she really enjoyed it, saving half of it and half of the potatoes for another meal (This behavior baffles me, but I am known to be lacking in restraint)

We both had pancakes on the side. They were good pancakes, our only real disappointment was that they only offer pumpkin pancakes seasonally and we would have preferred to order those (other places carry them year round)

We were there at a good time but understand that it gets ultra busy at breakfast."

It was a Saturday morning, so they were packed, but they got us seated quickly and our food came out fast too!! 

They aren&#39;t a simple breakfast kind of place, I&#39;d say they had a lot of very interesting options!!  My husband had eggs, potatoes, toast, and ham.  He was happy with everything, especially the ham, but said that the toast was not warm. I had the sweet potato waffles and chicken with eggs Benedict.  It was awesome!!! The sauce was a creamy chipotle and they cooked the eggs over medium for me since I don&#39;t like the Benedict texture.  The waffles were more of a wheaty taste to me than sweet potato, but it was awesome!!

The meals are a little pricey, but the food was delicious and the portions were large.  We love that they give you a pitcher of water and a pot of coffee at your table so you don&#39;t have to wait for refills!!!"

There was one table of customers seated and eating, otherwise the place was empty. I stood there for five minutes waiting to be acknowledged in any way by the staff who I could see moving about towards the back of the restaurant but not making eye contact. Finally another person entered the restaurant and two staff members approached that person to ask if they wanted a booth or table. I&#39;ve rarely been ignored but today was my day. I mentioned that I had been waiting five minutes and was posting my experience to which shoulders were shrugged. I&#39;d have left if I weren&#39;t waiting for friends, but they too were just arriving.

It&#39;s breakfast so not much can go wrong, the only complaint was from one person in our group. She ordered eggs over easy but they came fried. My eggs over easy were just that. The price for two eggs, hash browns, toast and coffee was a couple bucks higher than other breakfast joints.

I will only be back because the group wants to meet here in two weeks. I&#39;m looking forward to seeing what my experience is like another day. After all, maybe they were just having a bad rude customer service morning."

Waited only ten minutes to be seated. Server was pleasant. My wife and I both had cream of chicken soup which was pretty good. We also both had turkey club which was subpar at best. Turkey looked like it was out of an Oscar Mayer package. Fries were hot but tasted like corn tortillas possibly from the oil they were fried in. Worst was the bathroom. Men&#39;s bathroom reeked of urine and the soap dispenser has been ripped off the wall and was laying on the sink. Gross. My wife used restroom also and stated in was unkempt as well. I rarely write bad reviews but I felt this place deserved one. Many better breakfast/ lunch options in the area. Jam and jelly cafe in Woodridge and Juicy-O right down the street in Naperville are far superior. Will not dine here again.

This place did not achieve the &#39;wow&#39; factor unfortunately and I&#39;m certain I won&#39;t be back.

When my husband and I first walked in, we were kindly greeted by the host and seated immediately. The booth was huge and already set for four people, but the host didn&#39;t remove the extra plates, cups, and silverware which kind of bothers me, but it&#39;s not a big deal.

We waited about ten minutes before our waiter finally came over and took our drink orders and food orders. He was not the least bit friendly. Also, he did not bother to remove the extra table settings either. Kind of a big deal.

So far, we were not having a great &#39;eggsperience&#39; (I wonder how many people have made that joke in their reviews of this place). Maybe the food will be better.

And it was. I ordered the mushroom, spinach, and onion omelette with a side of pancakes. It was only $8.99 and it was massive. I couldn&#39;t even finish half of it. The omelette itself was really delicious. It had a ton of mushrooms, onions, and spinach which was great.

My husband ordered the chicken salad sandwich with the fresh fruit, also $8.99. He was not a fan. The chicken salad was way too sweet because it was packed with fruit (grapes and maybe apricot?) and nuts. The chicken salad did not cover the sandwich either. It was like someone scooped it out of a bowl with an ice cream scoop, plopped it on the center of the sandwich, and cut the sandwich in half. My husband also didn&#39;t like that they threw a giant piece of lettuce and tomato on the side. Either put it on the sandwich or don&#39;t put it on the plate at all, but the presentation looks sloppy when you do that. The fruit was good though.

Once we got our food, our waiter didn&#39;t bother to return until we were nearly finished with our meal when he asked if we needed a box and our check. Not cool. They place a pitcher of water at your table when you first sit down so they don&#39;t have to be bothered with bringing refills too, which I&#39;m also not a fan of.

As I said before, there are plenty of breakfast/lunch joints in Naperville that are really, really great and this just wasn&#39;t one of them. Although, I&#39;m not saying that this place was bad either. The food was decent, but the customer service was extremely poor. The restaurant was beautiful and very clean, but the menu seemed a little on the expensive side and the lunch menu was lacking (variety and taste). For every positive, there was a negative."

Once they were dried and crusty :( 

Definitely worth a try instead of your usual place you probably go to. Wait staff is a bit indifferent to your needs. They take orders and bring food. That&#39;s it. But I go for food not for camaraderie with the employees. The owner is there all the time and I like that."

Prompt service.  I love the interior is modern but bright with yellow and Orange Colors.  Prices are fair.  Last week I went and ordered a burger since it was lunch hour.   Burger was great.  I was surprised. They use good quality ingredients and accommodating as far as menu.   They have loose leaf hot tea which is a nice treat and different than usual tea.  Something for everyone here

I have been a loyal customer up until today when the scum bag male host seated two people he knew in front of about 12 other people who were there before them.

It&#39;s a bit far for us to go for breakfast but if we &#39;re heading up towards Naperville/Aurora to shop it&#39;s our first choice. 
He loves their mushroom omelet or scrambles with your choice of ingredients. Also he enjoys the frittata.  
I love that they have fresh squeezed o.j.  And my first pick is the Apple pecan crepe.
I have to give a shout out to Darlene, a terrific waitress.
Why a 4 star review?  They &#39;re a tad more expensive then our other choice breakfast places."

The waiting area is severely lacking,  in that this place doesn&#39;t have one, still the hostess is always friendly and they&#39;re usually quick to get you seated. While the food is great, no one here smiles ever! It&#39;s not a very welcoming environment once you get seated and it&#39;s actually really awkward when you make eye contact with any of the employees when they&#39;re passing by and they don&#39;t smile or even acknowledge that you&#39;re staring right at each other. 
 
I can&#39;t really pinpoint if they hate working there or they just hate people - I&#39;ve worked in customer service for almost 10 years, I&#39;m bitter too but I manage to smile and remain kind in any guest interaction. If you like good breakfast food, this place is great, if ingenuity and guest service make a difference don&#39;t bother."

The only plus about this restaurant. I just find it a little pricey to be honest. The plate of French Toast was 8$ and didn&#39;t even include a side. The orange juice is 3$ and a small small glass. It&#39;s just ridiculous. I will pay for good food but this is just breakfast. Eh. The atmosphere is nice,  although our waitress was anything but warm and inviting.

I have been forced to eat at this place 3 times and that is 3 times too many. They are severely over-priced, and their food is not even that good. Also nothing ever comes with your meal it seems like - you are charged for every little thing as an extra.

The only good thing they have going is that they offer lox/salmon breakfast items (which do not taste too old and fishy), and most places here in the midwest don&#39;t have that.... but this is the only redeeming factor I can name for this place. The ONLY one. If it wasn&#39;t for the salmon tidbit, I&#39;d give this place -1.5 stars.

Also the service is terrible, or maybe all three times that I&#39;ve visited our waitress was having a bad day?? In any case, not coming back any more. I&#39;d rather throw my money away somewhere else ."

The last time I was here I didnt really care for it.  But this time I kind of feel indifferent about it. I feel like its just one step up from Denny&#39;s or I hop.  The portions are big but the menu does not wow you. Or at least it didnt wow me. I ended up making my own egg scrambler with cheese, bell peppers and sausage, I got hash brown and toast. It was a easy mea that I could have made at home but was too darn lazy to do. I guess im giving it two stars for customer service.  Mu waitress was the sweetest thing and the manager was super cool. Talkative and attentive.  Mmmmmmmm maybe I will try them again and see"

Let me tell you, I am absolutely repulsed even at the thought of bad breakfast. With that said, I paid this place a visit with hubby and kiddos in tow. We were greeted by a nice gentleman who sat us at a booth. The decor was bright and clean. Our waitress approached and was cordial but nothing over the top. I&#39;m not even sure she introduced herself by name, but whatever. 

I finally chose a custom skillet with sausage, tomato and onion. Before I could recite the pledge of allegiance, our food arrived. Wow, that was fast and it was hot too. No complaints there. The food appeared tasty, so now I&#39;m anxious. I ripped the tape off my silverware and took a bite. Hmmm, not bad, the skillet was actually quite tasty. The pancakes were small and dry but I buttered them anyway and doused them with the warm syrup. Not bad. The freshly squeezed OJ was also refreshing. During our meal the nice gentleman who greeted us, came by our booth with some small talk. Nice.  

Overall, I was able to finish my meal without being grossed out and we were acknowledged by management as having a pulse. I will visit again when in the mood for breakfast. However, I am still in search of that super yummy breakfast that will incite a smile while I rock to the beat of my own drum."

Second major thing was that I was sat at a table that had filthy dishes.  The biggest turn off was the coffee cups.  They were obviously not cleaned at all. They still had fresh coffee rings and even had the lip marks inside and outside of the cups.  That was enough between the cigarette smoke smell and the nasty coffee cups.  I just got up an walked out.  I will never be back to any location after that.  If that was the way customers have dishes presented to them then I could not imagine what a hell hole the rest of the restaurant that the public cannot see.  I should have taken photos but but I was too grossed out by the &#34;Egg&#34;sperience.  That is how infectious illness are spread.

I had about 45 minutes before I started and thought this place would be good. I called the order in because it was very busy. The person who took my order first said they did not have the item which I saw on the menu online. I wanted crepes with eggs, cheese, and veggies inside so I just ordered their crepes with scrambled eggs, onions, peppers, and cheese. She did not act like there would be a problem-she even asked me what kind of cheese I wanted and actually said no problem. I told her I also wanted hash browns and she said they would come with what I ordered. She told me 20 minutes. I waited about 15 minutes and went inside. The woman who helped me (she must have been the manager) asked me what I ordered and after a few seconds of looking around, she told me that the order had not been placed. She left the very crowded front and went into the kitchen and got my order ready in 5 minutes. She also said hash browns did not come with the order but she gave me a side order on the house. The food was delicious but I by then only had 8 minutes to eat it before work. I really appreciated the speed in which I got my order once it was placed and the food was good but I don&#39;t know that I want to try this place again"

I wish I came before, I always end up at Noodles next door but I was happy to come in with my co worker and try something different!

Amazing menu, it&#39;s hard to decide what you want to get! The cheesecake french toast was amazing. Two french toasts mounted with melting cream cheese and sweet, fresh strawberries. Excellent presentation and came out quick. I was happy to split it with a friend. 

We got seated fast and our waitress was sweet and patient considering we had no idea whether to settle in with the delicious and healthy salad selection or be (bad) and get the frenchtoasts with a side of turkey sausages (yum- 4 to a plate). 

Why not a 5? Because of the coffee! I&#39;m not a huge picky coffee gal, and all though I don&#39;t like weak coffee, Eggsperience&#39;s serve it too strong. I would have got the regular instead of the white chocolate (nothing like starbucks) with a shot of expresso. Unless you really want a pick-me-up kind of thing. They do have a lot of drink specials like smoothies and so forth.

Otherwise, friendly stop and place! I could def. see myself coming again. It&#39;s like a sunshine in there, all bright and yellow. Many families with their kids were inside."

My &#34;eggsperience&#34; was a disaster. And unlike most reviews on here, I actually did not step foot in the restaurant.

I am unable to walk due to a swollen ankle, so I went to their website so that we could call in a take out order. My husband and I checked out their online menu, and selected the Oven Baked Apple Pancake and La Portabella Omelet. I called to place the order...the hostess repeated everything back to me, accurately. She then said it would be ready in 15 minutes. I said, &#34;even with the oven baked pancake?&#34; (Which normally takes 20-30 minutes to bake) and she said &#34;everything will be ready in 15 minutes&#34;. 

When my husband went to pick up our food, he learned, at that point, that they no longer carried neither the Oven Baked Apple Pancake nor the La Portabella Omelet. They had simply replaced BOTH of our meals with substitutes that THEY chose. My husband ended up with the Apple Pecan pancakes (he doesn&#39;t even like pecans) and I had a regular omelet with cheddar cheese and button mushrooms (the original omelet called for Asiago cheese and a mushroom wine sauce that I was really looking forward to).

This was a pretty disappointing experience. If your menu items change, first of all, your hostess needs to be aware of that so that when a customer calls, she can inform them. Second, let the customer make the decision on what substitutes they may want, instead of imposing your choice on them. And third, how about taking down the customer&#39;s phone number so that if there&#39;s a problem with their order, you can actually call them back and let them know.

Although they &#34;comped&#34; the pancakes for us, we won&#39;t be going back here. We&#39;ll stick to Pancake Cafe, who actually does serve wonderful Oven Baked Apple Pancakes."

Rude staff, gross oily floor, and the food just tasted bad. I always thought you can&#39;t really mess up breakfast food because it&#39;s relatively easy to make. We got the regular pancakes and they were powdery...The worst part was that I got ripped off by the mango juice. It was claimed that it is freshly made, but it tastes exactly the same as the ones from a bottle from a non-refrigerated aisle in a grocery store. They charged me $4.6 for a small glass. 

It was an experience and certainly wasn&#39;t a worthwhile one."

I got a 1/2 soup (mushroom) and 1/2 sandwich (ordered tuna at first but had to send it back because it was not good...so I got chicken).  The soup was marvelous!!

I called 2 weeks prior to Mother&#39;s Day and asked if they took reservations.  I was advised they did, and they had a limited menu for Mother&#39;s Day.  All seemed fine, and I made a reservation for 20 people for 11 am.  I was advised at the time that due to the large party, we would be split into multiple tables, which I confirmed with the host was not an issue as we know large parties can be challenging.

When we arrived 15 minutes earlier than our reservation time, the place was a madhouse, but I assumed we would be fine considering I made a reservation well in advance.  Not to mention we were early for our reservation time.  After we finally squeezed through the crowd to the hostess table, we were told our tables weren&#39;t ready, they didn&#39;t have a large enough table to seat all of us, and they would seat us as tables became available.  

Over the course of the next 45 minutes, as we weren&#39;t being seated, we were told the following:

1 - At the time I called, they didn&#39;t take reservations.  I asked then, why was my name on the reservation list when I checked in to the restaurant?  They could not answer.

2 - &#34;We can&#39;t hold tables for 3 hours.&#34;  I asked where they got 3 hours from considering we were early for our reservation time.  They could not answer.

3 - &#34;We&#39;re trying to seat you all together.  That&#39;s what you want, isn&#39;t it?&#34;  I advised AGAIN no, I was told at the time of making the reservation that we would be split into multiple tables, which was fine then, and was fine now.  They could not respond

We told them we expected to be the next 20 people sat, and they proceeded to seat multiple parties of 2, 4, and 5, ahead of us.  They were also telling everyone who asked how long the wait time was, that it was 20 minutes, regarldess of party size or how full the restaurant was.  At that point we walked out.

I never received an apology at any point during this time frame.  I realize it was one of the biggest brunch days of the years, but I also realize that Mother&#39;s Day happens every year, so you would think that they would know how to handle a crowd.  The woman next to me demanded to speak to a manger, as she took her son to the bathroom and when they got back, the bussers had cleared their table in an effort to move people out quicker.  She also advised them they would not be returning.

Do not take a group to this restaurant.  I&#39;m sure the food is lovely.  Unfortunately I will never be returning to find out."

You could tell the waitress didn&#39;t want to be there by her body language.  Ordered coffee and she didn&#39;t give me sugar. Found hair in my eggs and had it returned. They gave me a new plate.  She said she told the manager about it and the manager never came by to apologize or offer it on the house.  When I paid at the register the hostess asked how was it and I said I found hair in my breakfast....silence.

Food wasn&#39;t eggsactly special and service wasn&#39;t eggscellent.  Prices are on the high end."

I have never loved the food but my family enjoys the variety.  As a vegetarian, they have very little to offer for me. My husband enjoys the omelettes and my kids always find something to eat as well.

Today my daughter ordered Mickey Mouse pancakes with chocolate chips in them. I ordered a skillet with tomato substituted for the eggs on top.  My daughter received a Mickey Mouse pancake with five mini chocolate chips sprinkled on top. Syrup arrived five minutes later, after I requested it. My skillet came with bacon in it. I asked for it to be returned and replaced. The waitress had no problem with that.  In about five minutes, I did get another skillet with no bacon but the tomatoes and spinach were horrendous.  It was essentially inedible.

Eggsperience is a great local restaurant, but I&#39;m worried that quality is being sacrificed for speediness and making the most money possible.

If I had a choice, I would not go back."

July 2014, while visiting Chicago, but staying in Aurora, one of our breakfast options was Eggsperience.  They give you a lot of food, so the 7 of us could have actually shared 3-4 plates.  All of us walked out of there with our leftover food.  On that day after breakfast, I drove to Detroit and when I got there, I put my food in my sister&#39;s refrigerator.  The next morning, I warmed up my hash browns and pancakes and said to myself that I&#39;m sure these pancakes are going to be rubbery - NO MA&#39;AM they were STILL good like they were the day before.

Our waitress brought it back, dropped it on the table, said they were out of egg whites and &#34;enjoy&#34;. She then walked away. No offer to make me something else. Just a rude &#34;enjoy&#34; like I must eat it.

She didn&#39;t return until 10 minutes later when she saw I didn&#39;t eat it, and then offered to get me something else. At this point, it&#39;s not about the egg whites. I would have ordered something else. It was the rude and awful customer service. Never again."

I went back to the host station to remind her we requested seating for a party of 9. She didn&#39;t let me get all my words out before she said with aggravation &#39; oh yeah 9, I&#39;ll add a chair&#39;. She was not welcoming or friendly. Our waitress was great and the food was average breakfast food. The hot espresso drinks were not tasty. Once we finished we went to the front counter to pay and the gentleman collecting checks was speaking to another guest but they were obviously friends and chatting about what college degree he wanted to obtain. He took the receipt and my debit card while continuing to speak with the other women. He then handed me my receipt copy to sign. No words were exchanged. There was no thank you or even a tiny gesture of gratitude. I will never visit this location again. The poor customer service was shocking."

There was a line with largish families but we got seated rather promptly. The food was excellent and uber fast. 

They have specials they feature up front and that you can ask for an explanation, but watch it as the drooling will officially begin ;)

Very nice staff, and just a wonderful breakfast place. The ton of cars parked outside at pretty much any time are an indication of how good they are."

It was your average breakfast spot in a town with a lot of choices for said meal. Busy on a week-end, fine food but not outstanding, ditto for service. The setting is very pretty with glass tiles in varying colors of reds and yellows. 

The place looks deceptively small from the outside but opens up inside to be a lot bigger. 

Servings are big, which isn&#39;t necessarily a good thing. Potato pancakes and bacon were a fine choice, but a lot of food for me. My boyfriend got the chorizo omelette, which came with hash browns and a side of pancakes; even with his healthy appetite, this was a LOT of food, and it&#39;s sort of hard to reconstitute breakfast foods if you take them home (they&#39;re just not the same). 

Overall, a fine option if you&#39;re in this area, though I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d go out of my way to go here again; I prefer the Pancake Cafe at 75th and Rickert, about 2 miles away."

The food is phenomenal and the service has always been great. Not to mention each time I&#39;ve been, my food comes out within 10 minutes. Everyone is super nice and even the bus boys are attentive. If you go on a Saturday morning (as opposed to Sunday) there&#39;s usually not a wait and you can be seated right away. Portion sizes are huge, and most stuff is under $10.  They&#39;ve also got tons of delicious drinks like smoothies, shakes, fresh squeezed juices and coffees. If you haven&#39;t been here yet and are exploring new breakfast places, you HAVE to try Eggsperience. From one breakfast lover to another, you won&#39;t regret it!!!"

Ordered the pancakes (which tasted like the frozen ones from the grocery stores).  The egg omelette tasted like they were made from liquid eggs. 

The food quality reminds me of McDonald&#39;s. McDonald&#39;s breakfast menu items might taste better.

I&#39;m not complaining by any means, it is only an observation. But hell, I thought I was eating in Boystown and not Naperville. Kudos for that! 

I went here after the gym with John S. I was looking for something light to eat after running on the treadmill. There really wasn&#39;t anything like that (except fruit), so I decided to go with the breakfast quesadilla. I have to say that was one hell of a quesadilla. It was plate-sized and not to mention there were hash-browns underneath it. So light was not an option for this one. But it was very delicious and fresh tasting. I ended up taking most of it home, it was too much. 

The service was prompt and attentive. There was not a wait to get our food, which was good because I was starving. The coffee was a tad too strong. I had a complete caffeine headache from that all day long. But overall, it&#39;s a great place for breakfast. I will be back if not for the food, then for the eye candy."

This time we had eggs and hash browns, and a veggie omelet.  Both of the main dishes were very well prepared - the corned beef was among the tastiest I can recall.   Hash browns were cooked to perfection.  

The decaffeinated coffee was excellent, and they bring a carafe to your table.  My companion is a tea drinker, and they brought tea steeping in a teapot, so she had plenty of the hot, flavorful tea.  She was impressed.   

We were there at something like 2:00 PM, so the place was quiet and service was plentiful.  If the restaurant is full, it is definitely noisier.  If you&#39;re anywhere close and are looking for breakfast, it&#39;s hard to go wrong here."

Disappointed doesn&#39;t begin to explain what happened, we had a reservation for mother&#39;s day.  EVERYONE especially the manager was rude.  Traveling family for a wedding trying to get together for brunch while we were all in the same location, which rarely never happens.  Reservation was made 2 weeks prior to the day, when made there was no issues, we double checked during the conversation.  No one was willing to help us get seated, never once received an apology or even &#34;I&#39;m working on it&#34; from the staff all we received was argument telling us we were in the wrong.  When I mentioned we had a reservation, the manager got defensive told us they didn&#39;t take reservations, yet our name was listed before we got there.  She told me she told me this on the phone when she talked to me, which was a lie because she talked to my girlfriend who made the reservation, and if she looked at the reservation my girlfriends name was listed.  Our party showed up in full at 10:45 for our 11AM reservation.  By the time we finally left at 11:30 we will had not been seated and there was no attempt to seat us.  Everyone coming into the restaurant was told it was going to be at 20 minute wait, that was a complete lie.   

Multiple groups of people, totaling more than 20 people were sat prior to us, we told the management we didn&#39;t need to all sit together, we could have sat down in 10 minutes if the team working knew how to manage.  I understand places are busy, and I fully understand it was Mother&#39;s Day, don&#39;t lie to us and say yes we will accept you and then when we show up and your restaurant is so mismanaged you can&#39;t accommodate a group of people.

The food is expensive... running around $12 for one b-fast plate BUT it&#39;s huge. I split the veggie crepes with my date and it was enough for both of us and we still had a third of it to take home so the value was pretty good but the food was not so good. I didn&#39;t like the ultra sweet crepe with the savory filling; it was like putting chocolate on a steak but with less flavor, in a bad way. NG= not good. 

The thing about this place that most offended me, oddly enough, was the lighting. It&#39;s the A.M. God damn it. I don&#39;t need ultra white light shining on me. I looked around the restaurant and saw all these people who just outside the doors of this place look great but inside you can see every crack, blemish, vein, everything.

The space is a bright, airy, breakfast and lunch only type place. A little odd that the hostesses look like they are dressed up for a night on the Vegas strip while the rest of the wait staff keeps it casual in polos and khakis. 

But the food. Yes, the food. The menu is quite large, and pretty much whatever you are in the mood for, if not on the menu explicitly, appears to be available through one of the build-your-own options. I had a scrambler with Chorizo and monterey jack, and it was amazing. The hash browns were also perfectly done. Can&#39;t remember what my wife had, but our daughter had the mickey mouse pancakes and gobbled them all up.

Breakfast for the three of us was $35, which I thought was a little steep for breakfast, so that is the only thing keeping me from giving this a fifth star."

However, the coffee inside the one that I got was metallic-tasting, lukewarm, and all around repulsive to drink. 

The decor is eye-searingly bright yellow with an &#34;egg&#34; theme. The service was quick and decent enough -- the food was ho-hum for the price. If you are going to name a restaurant after a certain namesake, at least take care to do that namesake right; the scrambled eggs I received were semi-warm and rubbery. The portions were pretty big; they&#39;d probably do better if they reduced the portion size, along with the price. This restaurant will cost you.

We got onion rings &amp; breaded mushrooms as an appetizer.  The onion rings had little-to-no &#34;onion&#34; taste and the breaded mushrooms were too thin and too dry.

We ordered the Papa&#39;s Special (cheese, sausage, mushroom, green pepper and onion).  When we picked it up we were very excited because it smelled AMAZING!  When we got home and opened the box, all I saw was the veggies.  I don&#39;t know what I was expecting, but I&#39;m used to them being more finely chopped and UNDER the cheese.  That being said, I don&#39;t think there was ANY cheese on the pizza!  The crust was pretty much nonexistent as well.  It felt like we basically ate strictly veggies (not even sure if I tasted any sausage).

My fiancé and I were hungry, so we did eat about half the pizza, but we both just said that we felt &#34;sad&#34; about it.  One positive note is that the veggies DID taste very fresh, but I don&#39;t think we will be ordering from here again."

They have a pretty solid selection of sandwiches and sides too: Italian beef, hot dogs, fries and mushrooms to name a few.

You will pay more for their pizza compared to some of the big chains in the area, but I feel like it&#39;s a better pizza.

I say that I &#34;feel&#34; like it&#39;s a better pizza, because I don&#39;t think anyone really knows to be sure.

And of course, she was craving pizza, so we picked up a double decker with our local $3 off coupon!

We were able to get in our order at 9:45, pick up at 10:05 (past their normal close time), and of course, enjoy some delicious late night double decker pizza. 

We normally love their thin crust, but with her tooth pulled, we decided to go with something softer.  And it was still delicious.  Generous coverage of fresh mushroom (not canned!), and very cheesy... ultimately, we prefer the thin crust, but the double decker was just what we needed for the occasion.

Verdict:  Great customer service, tasty pizza, worth checking out, specifically for the thin crust!  We&#39;re fans and we keep coming back!"

My friend was hesitant when she saw it from the outside but I showed her some of the Yelp photos and lured her in.

I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever had this great of a customer service north of the Mason-Dixie line. The hostess, waitress Michelle(?) and all the other staff were extremely warm and welcoming. 

Definitely try the spinach special double decker pizza. It was really good!

The only reason I knocked off a star was because it was a very long wait for the pizzas. I&#39;ll probably order ahead next time I go.

And can I just reiterate how nice everyone was? I&#39;ll be coming here again during my Lady Time so I can cry into my pizza, eat my feelings and be comforted by the sweet staff. See you in 28 days."

We wanted an event that would be casual and simple and suggested it be a &#34;pizza and beer&#34; kind of event. Well in advance they contacted another local pizzeria and were told that our request for enough food to feed 40 people would be accommodated, but when they called to finalize the order the day before, were told that the restaurant didn&#39;t have enough staff to be open early enough to have food ready by the time that had been agreed upon. 

Our family then looked around and found Papa&#39;s Pizza Place. Not only were their staff gracious and helpful, they made suggestions about some additional items in order to ensure that all the food would be hot when it arrived, threw in a few &#34;extras&#34;, like coleslaw and sauces, and provided coupons so that in the end the cost was less than it would have been from the original place they had contacted. 
As promised, the food arrived hot and tasty, our guests were well fed and happy, and our shower was exactly what we had hoped. 

Thank you for helping us to have a wonderful event!"

WRONG. Me and my family are sausage pizza lovers. Their sausage had little rock like pebbles that literally made it inedible. When we called to talk to the manager we were told it was just the fresh kenaf(? Spell check, I&#39;d never heard of it before but my mom has and she believed it was probably uncooked?) that the sausage was made with. So the only possibilities are 1) their sausage pizza tastes like you&#39;re eating glass 2) something went wrong that night... &amp; the manager swears it&#39;s not #2 so it must be #1.
However I give it 2 stars because the staff was friendly while we were ordering (although they should&#39;ve been better when we called to ask what the hell was on the pizza) and the pizza had potential... if only it I wasn&#39;t scared I&#39;d die eating it."

We had some issues with the service however.  We seemed to wait an extraordinary amount of time for food and for drink refreshes.  I got the feeling that the waitress forgot about us.

Whenever possible, I go with deep dish, especially since I moved to Chicagoland five years ago and first experienced how the heavy yet heavenly version is locally. However, Papa&#39;s Pizza Place definitely scores points with their pies.

Hubby and I ordered delivery for dinner, selecting the family size Papa&#39;s Special of cheese, sausage, green pepper, onion and mushroom. I also always prefer a salad with my pies, so I also chose the classic Antipasto with two dressings, creamy Italian and creamy garlic, on the side (for the sake of variety). We were starving so thankfully the delivery arrived much quicker than the estimated time.

Pizza crust was crisp and tomato sauce tasted legit with a hint of sweet and tangy. Veggies were julienned, which I prefer over chunks just so they are more evenly distributed. It was filling, yet not so carby due to the thin crust, so I didn&#39;t feel too guilty.

Antipasto had a ton of veggies mixed through the iceberg including green peppers, white onion, tomato, olives, cucumber and mushroom, along with the mozz and boiled egg, but there was not enough meat for me - just a few pepperoni slices. Both dressings were flavorful, but I preferred the creamy Italian over the garlic because the garlic one was ultra thick making it difficult to pour and had a bit of an off-putting color.

In the end, I&#39;d like to try dining in the location some time to compare the delivery experience. And I know this is the place we&#39;ll call for pizza during parties and gatherings."

 The regular thin crust pizza was crisp and thin like a pizza on a cracker making the flavor of the sauce, cheese, sausage, and mushroom stand out not having to fight the dough taste. 
*caution- because the crust is so thin you can eat a lot more pizza than normal.

 The double-decker is even more good flavor. Most expect a thick crust pizza when they hear double-decker. Here they stuff more toppings between two thin crust. This is a reason to eat with enough people to justify ordering both types of pizza and enjoy a little of each.

Our group enjoyed the meal and the great attentive service.

On the negative side, the dinning room is outdated (okay with me) and the strip mall they are located in is creepy."

Finally, I have decided that Papa&#39;s Pizza is the spot! Whenever I want a last minute pizza, Papa&#39;s is where I turn to. 

I prefer their thin crust with sausage. My boyfriend adds pepperoni on his side and that tastes good too. Sometimes, we order the double decker pizza. This is a great alternative to the typical thin crust. It takes a bit longer to cook. But, it is a special treat. The double decker is basically a thicker baked crust. 

Their appetizers are not anything to write home about though. Papa&#39;s has your run of the mill appetizers such as mozzarella sticks, french fries, garlic bread, cheese garlic bread, etc. I think the only thing that prevents me from going to Papa&#39;s all of the time over say, Home Run Inn, would be their lack of creativeness on their appetizers. 

The atmosphere is a bit dated and strange at Papa&#39;s. It&#39;s pretty dark inside and the decor is very 70&#39;s/early 80&#39;s. However, the service is very great. The waitresses are all very attentive and very sweet. 

I have always meant to try their chicken because it looks really good. But, every time I go there I feel the need to have the pizza!

I would definitely recommend Papa&#39;s if you are from the area and are looking for your local favorite pizza spot."
papas-pizza-place-woodridge,Mark D.,YpCvyeGKHr5ql4C3AVOVGw,"Aurora, IL",0,1,0,35,26,4dA-uVSKDqnCslI4e82Wpg,5.0,2013-01-02,"I&#39;ve been going to Papa&#39;s Pizza Place since 1981, and things have remained the same since my first visit as a kid.  If you want to eat excellent pizza in a pleasently preserved darkly lit time capsule, then head to the Woodridge location before someone makes a bad decision to update the decor.  Trust me, there are few places like this in existence.

Papa&#39;s is my favorite pizza, hands down.  Their pizza has the perfect mix of cheese and sauce, and the crust is somewhat cripsy with the right amount of chew to it.  Service is always consistent, and my mother continues to recognize a member of the wait staff that has been there for 30+ years.  She also states that the salad is excellent and has remained the same, and her all-time favorite.  I&#39;m not a salad eater whatsoever, but can concur that the one my mother orders always have a perfectly cut hard boiled egg on top.

I have tried many other things on the menu over the years and have been very satisfied (appetizers, burgers &amp; chicken sandwiches), although their pizza is what keeps bringing me back.  Recently, I tried the double decker pizza, which was a great variation.  It&#39;s like taking two thin crust pizzas and putting one on top of the other.

So back to the things that make Papa&#39;s Pizza Place stand out and worth your visit alone (think of this as a little list of easter eggs or hidden mickeys - to those of you who know what that means)

- Consistent food and service, and great pizza (this is important to me, as many establishments seem to change preparation and ingredients from time to time).
- The 100 or so large white globe lights that are in diagonal patterns along the ceiling (late 70&#39;s, early 80&#39;s decor).
- The green triangular patterned carpet and tables with the graph paper type squares (again - late 70&#39;s, early 80&#39;s decor).
- The beaded curtain at the back of the restaurant, in front of the emergency exit.
- The numerous city of Woodrige decals on the front door.  It&#39;s like buying a classic car with all the old city stickers.
- The trangular patterend glass booth dividers used throughout the restuarant (And again, late 70&#39;s early 80&#39;s decor).
- The lighted numbers toward the ceiling (in the center of the restaurant) AND the occasional doorbell that goes off to notify servers when orders are ready.
- The row of metal peacocks along the wall, the replica vintage rifles, and the old-time historic pictures of popular cities on the wall.  Still not sure what is in common there, but I like it becuase that strangeness remains the same.
- The thin gold trim found all over the place that only existed a few decades ago
- And finally, the tallboy urinal in the men&#39;s room. &#39;nuff said.."

I stopped in and ordered a Beef n&#39; Cheese with a side of fries to go. It was very tasty! The beef had good flavor and they piled on the cheese and baked it to perfection. The only thing that kept me from giving it a perfect score was the sandwich was a little dry, next time I&#39;ll ask them to dip it for me. Next time you want a Italian Beef and don&#39;t want to go to the usual places, give Papa&#39;s a try."

The crust was dry and overdone this time.  Possibly it had to do with lack of business at our 9:30pm pickup - nobody at carryout, and nobody in dining room.

While it has been a while, I ate here alot when I was younger. After seeing some coupons in local mailers (you know the ones), I took my coupon and ordered a pizza. Strangely, it really hasn&#39;t changed my over the years (inside or in carry out). Neither has the food. My friends have continued eating here over the years and for good reason. They ate everything from pizza to chicken, beefs and burgers. I remember the made a very solid chicken, and made a hidden gem of a beef &amp; cheese (if I remember correctly, the load the beef &amp; cheese, then melt the cheese under a warmer- again, going off memory). With my friends still eating here and having some good meals, I thought now is the time to make a visit. Papa&#39;s Pizza, like Doggie Diner, is what one could call a &#34;Woodridge Institution&#34; by many since they&#39;ve been around so long. 

Many pizza places from my youth have gone down hill or out of business. Upon further review, this place is not one of them. Again, I prefer deep dish/pan pizza but won&#39;t back away from eating a piece of thin crust. I&#39;ll say this. Their thin crust is solid- soft but not too crispy. I normally order sausage &amp; mushroom on a pizza. Today, I did the Papa&#39;s Special (sausage, mushroom, onions, green peppers) &amp; it was just as I remembered. It had PLENTY of toppings and a nice balance of cheese and sauce. Great flavor but not overpowering. Pizza will take about 20 minutes and are pretty busy on weekends nights (after 6PM). I know this based on the parking I see there during those times. They have a sister location in Bolingbrook (ironically, right next to my barber). It&#39;s worth a try, especially if you&#39;re in the area."

It is very, very good. They also use fennel seed as a flavoring on their pizzas, which I think adds good flavor and is kind of unique. When you eat in, it can get crowded and takes awhile to get your pizza, longer than you&#39;d expect. I like to carry it out for that reason. But this is definately top notch, thin crust pizza."

Powered by a friendly staff that will welcome you as family is why they have been in business since the 70&#39;s.

It may not be for everyone, especially deep-dish and stuffed lovers, but if this is what you want it doesn&#39;t get much better than this.

I&#39;ve been ordering Papa&#39;s regularly since the late 1970s when they first opened and NO ONE in all those years who has eaten this pizza with me has not liked it.  In fact, of all the food in the town of Woodridge that I&#39;ve shared with friends and guests Papa&#39;s Pizza has probably received the most compliments.

You know something is good when friends who live far away are coming in for a visit and specifically ask, &#34;Hey, can we get that pizza again that we had last time?  What was that place called?&#34;  Ahem....that was Papa&#39;s Pizza Place! They may have forgotten the name, but they certainly did not forget the taste.

And you know that a place has to have good food to have prospered for almost 40 years in an ancient stripmall next to the seediest apartments in town without updating their dining room one iota.  Most of the place is still the same late-1970s chocolate brown color scheme.  It&#39;s not dirty or anything, it&#39;s just old and a bit unsightly nowadays.  They really should remodel the place and update it, it&#39;s overdue.  But I don&#39;t care because I don&#39;t go there to be awed by a spectacular dining room anyway.   I just want tasty, reliable pizza.
  
I don&#39;t know if Papa&#39;s is the best thin crust pizza around, but I can&#39;t think of any that I&#39;d like more if I have a choice - and that includes all the well-known places in the area like Lou Malnati&#39;s, Connies, Giordanos, Papa Passeros, Home Run Inn, Nancy&#39;s, Vito &amp; Nick&#39;s, etc.  It&#39;s always got plenty of cheese, good amount of fresh toppings (no canned stuff here), and the crust is cracker-crispy.  Great tasting sauce, too.  Plus, because it&#39;s so thin it gets baked faster than at other pizza places and usually only takes 15-20 minutes."

In my four-year search for a pizza place that could live up to my South-Side Chicago upbringing expectations, I had mistaken this one (ironically, the closest one to house) for a Papa John&#39;s and kept avoiding it. It wasn&#39;t until I tried Dan&#39;s Pizza on Maple in Downers Grove that I thought my quest had ended. But a little further than I&#39;d like to drive usually, on my second visit there I asked if they delivered to Woodridge. When they asked &#34;what part? and I said &#34;83rd &amp; Janes,&#34; they suggested I just go to &#34;Papa&#39;s Pizza Place&#34; right there instead (same family, same recipe).

The best thing about Papa&#39;s is consistency. Every pizza I&#39;ve had there (as well as every one I had at Dan&#39;s) has been perfect. Whether ordering only one or two toppings or ordering it &#34;loaded&#34; (my favorite is sausage, peperoni, tomatoes, garlic, and black olives), personal care is always taken to assure perfection! I never have to worry any more that the pizza won&#39;t come out right or change the way I order it &#34;extra-thin, not-burnt&#34;) depending on the toppings (they know how to do their job).

Also enjoy their fried chicken, antipasto salad, and garlic bread. Heard their chili (new menu item) is pretty good too, but I&#39;m yet to give it a try."

While already a fan of Dan&#39;s pizza &amp; familiar with the infamous double decker style pizza, I was curious to try this place out.  Wasn&#39;t crazy about the place located in the seedy section 8 part of town, which I had no idea Woodridge had.  After seeing the big menu on the wall &amp; it&#39;s carryout version on the table, I couldn&#39;t help but think that maybe this place &amp; Dan&#39;s were somewhat related since their menu formats were similar. 

 I ordered a 14&#39;&#39; 1 topping double decker ($21), which took 20 minutes. (the same as Dan&#39;s)  The only difference I saw was that the prices here seemed to be a few dollars more.  After my first taste, I felt somewhat underwhelmed.  I was expecting it to taste pretty similar to the other place.  Visually, it looked the same but, taste wise, it just didn&#39;t make it for me.  The pie just didn&#39;t have a good amount of flavor.  I&#39;m not bashing this place, especially since I got great service but, I was expecting a lot more since the food was kinda expensive."

How is this place still operating?  When it comes to Chicago and its pizza market, there is little room for error.  Now, I would never take a small chain like this and compare it to the success of, say, Lou Malnati&#39;s, but this place is simply terrible!

1) They will not deliver to our complex
2) The dining room is tiny and ancient - it looks like it was ripped out of my grandmother&#39;s old trailer home.
3) The food is disgusting.  No flavor whatsoever in their pizza, which was literally just dripping with grease (and it was just a cheese pizza; no meat!).
4) The wait staff was not very attentive.
5) The wait time was ridiculous.  Seems that they favor the kitchen to their delivery customers (the ones they choose to deliver to...)

I made the mistake of trying this place twice, and never again.  There are so many other better options out there.  

Why anyone eats here and likes it I&#39;ll never understand.  Do the people who swear by this place receive special treatment from the management?  Do they serve them the good pizzas, and serve the ones that fell on the floor to the rest?  Have the people who rank this place 5 stars ever had anyone else&#39;s pizza?  Do they know what they&#39;re missing?

Oh, and how about those prices?  Where do they get off charging so much for...well, anything?  I suppose they would need to make up for the lack of customers."

I guess if Papa&#39;s served horrible pizza, one could say the exterior of this restaurant wasn&#39;t surprising. Backhanded compliment, Papa. Give your face a sprucing! You deserve it. 
I like that Papa&#39;s Pizza isn&#39;t gloaty in its design, but it has the potential to be one of the best thin crust pizza in its neighborhood. I ate here two separate times with two separate Q family members. A combined three Q&#39;s thoughts after din-din, &#34;Oh God. I have to stop.&#34; You know that feeling you have after eating something so good you forgot to stop and allow your brain some time to realize that you&#39;re full? Throwing up was out of the question as this pizza was to good to part with. The sauce was a wee sweet, which I love. The crust is thin and crunchy, and the cheese is perfectly browned.

As soon as you get into the parking lot, you can tell this place has been around for a while (read: a good thing).  You step in and it has the low yellowish light of an old school pizza parlor.  Vintage leather and wood furniture; cool ambience.  When we walked in, i think every other table was filled with a senior citizen...which at first was kinda skeptical.  We were in a bit of a rush, so I was worried for slow service.  We decided to order pizza after reading a bit about the place.  We go the double decker pizza.  WOW....it did NOT disappoint.  The crust (as others mentioned) was crispy and lots of pepperoni.  The cheese was tasty and not overly gorging.  Seasoning was top notch.  Our waitress understood our rush and gave us &#39;updates&#39; every few minutes on how the pizza was doing adn brought our check when we were eating so we could check out fast.  Good service.  

I love old-school, family pizza places like this and am VERY happy to have found it.  We&#39;ll be coming back a lot!!!!   They also have sandiwches (burgers/chicken), hot dogs, some pasta, fried chicken/fish, salads, and a few other things....so it&#39;s definitely more than just pizza.

I was really expecting to love this place based on the comments here. Unfortunately that wasn&#39;t the case on my take-out  lunch visit. One word can sum it up... bland.

Let&#39;s start on a positive note, though. The service at the counter was helpful, courteous and really friendly. I can see why regulars would feel immediately welcome and at home. They were great.

The food:

The lunch special comes with an egg roll, your choice of egg drop or hot &amp; sour soup, and white, fried or crispy noodles. We also got an order of crab Rangoon to see how it compares to others around here.

Egg Roll:
Not bad. lots of cabbage, a note of peanut butter and little bits of pork (no shrimp that I could see). It wasn&#39;t a gargantuan egg roll, but what was there was respectable.

Crab Rangoon:
They used the flat folding technique here. The filling was very cream cheesy - i&#39;m guessing Krab vs. authentic Crab, but either way, there wasn&#39;t much of it. This was a bit below average, I&#39;d say.

Hot and Sour Soup:
This is where things took a turn for the worse. I think a good hot &amp; sour soup should slap your taste buds around with the heat and make you pucker from the sourness. Well this was neither hot nor sour. All I could really taste was the stock. On top of that, it lacked any seasoning I had to salt it a fair amount to extract any flavor at all. Definitely way below average.

Entree: Kung Pao Chicken
Sadly, the Kung Pao suffered from the same lack of heat and seasoning as the hot and sour soup. It was exceptionally bland, even after using soy sauce. Now for the kicker - remember the &#34;crispy noodles?&#34; I was expecting some sort of pan frying to give some crispness and tooth to a traditional Chinese noodle. Nope. Instead, I get chow mein noodles - EXACTLY the same as you get at the grocery store. Not a good plan, Golden Bowl.

So on balance, I&#39;ll give it 3 stars, mainly because of the friendliness of the FOH. The egg roll and Crab Rangoon were decent, though not outstanding in any way, and the hot &amp; sour soup and Kung Pao chicken were uninspiring."

It is good... But Chinese food spots need to step it up with the flavors and not be shy of using herbs and spice. If in the mood for Asian, I would go to the Thai place in DG on Main St."

This is that classic Chinese place that has been around forever, owned by hardworking locals, and that offers dang good food in an atmosphere that leaves a lot to be desired. When you walk in, the decor is just awful. Green on green with red carpet. Random decorations on the walls, vinyl booths, paper place mats. A total hole in the wall. But it is clean, with a steady crowd even at 2pm on Sunday.And the food was really really good. The menu is a great selection of all your typical American-Chinese dishes: beef with broccoli, General Tso&#39; Chicken, Kung Pao Chicken.. but they also have a TON of other dishes you don&#39;t typically see. The menu is huge.
We ordered egg rolls, pot stickers, hunan chicken, General Tso&#39;s chicken, and beef with broccoli. We got a TON of food for only $45. Win. All portions came out family style.
The egg rolls were good. The potstickers were steamed with a thick doughy wrapper which I loved! I also really really enjoyed my General Tso&#39;s. Mostly dark meat, very moist and large pieces. Lots of sauce, not chewy. It was great!
This certainly isn&#39;t a destination restaurant from out of town (we were visiting family), but this is the kind of local Chinese place that everyone needs to live by. Quality Chinese at good prices. I absolutely wish I had Golden Bowl in my town!"

I&#39;m not kidding, it&#39;s the single best entree I&#39;ve ever eaten at a Chinese restaurant.  Portions are large and we&#39;ve never gone home hungry.

Downgraded because of hasty servers; my dad was halfway thru a BBQ spare rib when some young gal tried to take his plate away from him.....like literally mid-bite.  Chill, girl, when we&#39;re done with our moo goo gai pan, you&#39;ll be the first to know, but your waitress initiative is coming off as rude, ESPECIALLY when you attempt to reach over us to grab a plate.  Sorry.

*EDIT: going through my jacket pockets, I remembered something else--at the meal&#39;s outset, we were given wetnaps (wash&#39;n&#39;drys)....that weren&#39;t at all wet.  They&#39;d been sitting around for so long, all moisture was gone from half of them.  What, are we supposed to spit on them to &#39;activate&#39; the magic?  Dry wash&#39;n&#39;drys are roughly as useful as wet napkins.....which is to say, utterly useless.*

Decor is sparse and outdated, and (although my unabashed affinity for this place hates to admit it) the carpet is torn and beat up in places.  Food easily gets a 5*, but the service and interior condition bring it down a notch to a still-respectable 4*."

I am still on my quest to find a great Chinese place in or close to the Downers grove area. This place was one of the better ones I have visited. I ordered the Beef and broccoli lunch plate and some pot stickers. The plate came with soup ( I got the egg drop) and an egg roll. The Egg drop soup was so good. I would give that 5 stars and the egg roll was very tasty. The rest of the plate was just ok in my opinion. I would definitely try this place again but would try a different main dish and probably a noodle dish. I was not blown over by the rice or beef and broccoli and probably would not order it again.  The pot stickers were also really good ( I would make a trip just for them and some soup)  but I didn&#39;t like the dipping sauce that came with it. I am so used to a ginger type sauce and this was a red sauce that more of just a vinegar taste to it which was not my cup of tea. Overall good experience

We decided to make the most of it so we ordered the dinner for 3 special.  It was around $30 and included soup, egg rolls, crab rangoon, ribs, fried rice, kung pao chicken, sweet and sour chicken, and a shrimp dish that I can&#39;t remember the name of.  With two boys with me, I wasn&#39;t completely sure if all the food was enough but it ended up being more than we can handle.  Everything was really good.  Soup was pretty basic but still yummy.  The egg roll and crab rangoon was crunchy and fresh.  The main entrees were awesome.  The sweet and sour chicken was crunchy, the shrimp was fluffy, and the kung pao chicken was spicy.  We were all stuffed by the end.  The bill came up to be $41 without the certificate and around $17 with the deduction.  I&#39;d definitely come back.

It&#39;s one of those &#34;hole in the wall&#34; restaurants that don&#39;t look particularly appealing due to it&#39;s location and exterior.  Even the interior isn&#39;t that great.  So if you&#39;re looking for a certain ambiance I wouldn&#39;t recommend it... but the food is quality and for a decent price.

i used to come here for years when we used to live in the area, and it has yet to disappoint me. decor and ambiance may be lacking. the crowd is locals, peppered with the regular senior citizen group, but  this place still is consistently delish.

the showcase of the resturant: beef with chinese broccoli served with rice noodle [aka ho fun noodles] is the best ever.  they are able to make the noodles a bit crispy, the gravy is seasoned to perfection, and the chinese broccoli is cooked well and still maintains a great crisp.

lunch specials are pretty decent. entree, served with fried rice, soup, and an egg roll is about six bucks.

this spot has been here at least 14 years or so.  the older lady hostess is still moving strong, and the male owner has the greatest hustle.  i was glad to see this place still striving and hope that it continues on.  it really is a hidden gem in westmont."

The egg rolls are made fresh, (not from scraps) and are always hot and tasty.

The egg drop soup is a little thicker than most, and I really like it that way, it&#39;s best with a little pepper.

The fried rice is also a game winner, regardless of variety.

They even have fresh fortune cookies - with surprisingly good fortunes!

I have my beloved joy yee but its a good 20 min drive in no traffic to Naperville from DG just to pick up and that doesnt always work for me and the hungry kiddies in 5 inches of snow... so I started looking for good Chinese- Cantonese that was closer to home. 

I decided to try it based on their reviews- especially Mel- and drove to Golden Bowl to get a menu and order on the spot. The place is nothing special for ambiance but since I have kids that like Chinese I would bring them here because they probably wouldnt disturb anyone- there were about 3 tables occupied at 5:15. Just fine by me! Next time we&#39;re eating in.
 
For pickup, I went with the Singapore noodles (its my &#34;go to&#34; order- if a place messes it up then they probably will mess up everything else), Beef/broccoli chow fun and fish fillets in ginger sauce w/ Chinese broccoli.
I have to say everything was pretty good. No odd smells, no weird tastes, pretty standard and good.  the fish in ginger was really really good. They arent messing around with the ginger- its loaded up! I was pretty happy with it and its fairly cheap for the amount of food.
 
FYI - If this place was in Chinatown I&#39;d give it 3 stars- A OK just about covers it but since its in Westmont they get a star for proximity. Maybe some day they&#39;ll figure it out and get a brunch dim sum going out here- I&#39;d be in every weekend!"

Golden Bowl has very good food at decent prices and excellent service. They recognize my voice when I call in an order, greet me by name when I walk in and know exactly what I would be interested in ordering.

Dan and his family that own and operate Golden Bowl are about as nice of people as you will ever find.

We don&#39;t order Chinese too often so I pump myself up for an awesome meal when Dad says he&#39;s paying for take out. I was disappointed with the meal.

Also, ignore the generic and somewhat uninspired decor.  Now, please focus on the food.  Because, the food, it&#39;s oh-so-good.

My parents&#39; idea of a treat when my sistah and I were in High School, was to bring us here.  The food is consistently fresh and delicious.  The service is friendly, not intimidating, and capable.  The prices are slightly lower than comparable establishments in the Southwest burbs, but the food is visually appealing and the aromas wafting out of the kitchen make your tummy grumble.

George is right, there are two menus.  But the staff here is willing to provide you with recommendations and give you small samples.  You can also order off-menu.  The fish of the day, here, is almost always out of this world.  Yes, you might have to deal with fish eyes staring at you off the plate.  But!  And that is a big but!  If you can get over the eyes, the preparations are always topnotch and take advantage of the fish to underscore its flavor.

Mo Shoo Pork? You can get it here!  It&#39;s chock full of crisp veggies and paper thin pancakes to sop up the goodness of the filling.  The green beans?  Also delicious, and spicy enough to make you think someone slipped some Tabasco in your water when you weren&#39;t looking. 

The two dishes my family loves more than any other  at Golden Bowl are the Mongolian beef and the Satay Beef.  We never know what cuts of meat were used or how they were treated, but the beef literally melts in your mouth."

It&#39;s run by a husband and wife, who are awesome and really polite. I&#39;ve only dined in there a few times but every time I did, exceeded all expectations on service. Besides being unbelievable food, it never gets cold.....I live 15 minutes away from there and by the time I open it at home, it&#39;s still too hot to eat! My two favorite dishes there are Moo Shu Pork and Orange Beef, I&#39;ve never seen orange beef on any menu until I went there and it&#39;s ridiculous....down to the orange zest that they put into it.....I&#39;m starting to get hungry as I talk about it!! As far as all the other dishes I&#39;ve had there.....never one complaint. 

Seriously, if you happen to find yourself in the western burbs and you are in the mood for Chinese.....stop there! Also, don&#39;t be fooled by the outside appearance or the interior decor.....all you have to do is eat their food one time and all the rest doesn&#39;t matter!"

With all of the favorable reviews on here, I am a little surprised the place was empty (not a single sit down customer).  The restaurant has been around for 21 years (according to the wait staff) and it appears the decor hasn&#39;t been updated since.  However, the staff was super nice and helpful, and recommended dishes for us.  We had the lobster on ginger, shrimps with walnut, a vegetable dish, and a noodle dish for three people.  The portions were huge and both the lobster and shrimps with walnut were well-made.  The only dish that was so so was the noodle dish.  Overall, a pretty good place to go have some good Chinese food if you are not looking for ambience but a friendly staff.  Be sure to ask for recommendations if you go there."

The food is delicious and well prepared.  The service is top notch and the food comes promptly.

My last trip here was on a Saturday afternoon about 2 pm.  The restaurant was relatively empty, only two tables were occupied.  Since the lunch special ran until 3:00 pm, our group decided to go with that.  For $4.95 you get soup, an egg roll, rice and an entree&#39;.  I went for the Hunan Chicken for the entree&#39;, Hot and Sour Soup, and Steamed Rice.  The hot and sour soup was excellent, just the right amount of heat and all of the ingredients cut into a small size.  Their egg rolls are not their long suit but is still good.  Crusty shell with a filling of napa cabbage, shrimp and pork.  Shell is a bit to chewy for my taste but the mustard was great, the heat went straight to my sinuses.  The Hunan Beef was likewise excellent, large portion combined with steamed rice.  Just the right amount of heat and a nice balance of chicken and vegetables.  My friends had sweet and sour chicken and beef chop suey which they pronounced as excellent.  The whole feast for $4.95 each, which included the standard tea and cookies as well.

The service is quick, the food is fresh, hot and fast, and the owners and waiters are very attentive.  Dining area is clean and comfortable.  They have a bar from which you can order drinks.  I highly recommend this restaurant, I eat here whenever I am in the area.  My personal favorites are the Mongolian Beef , Kung Pao Chicken and Beef with Broccoli."

Last night I was craving a steak. And I didn&#39;t want some fancy, overpriced steakhouse steak, and I didn&#39;t want to cook myself, so we headed to Steven&#39;s. 

Now I wasn&#39;t expecting anything spectacular. But what I ended up with definitely was. My steak was cooked perfectly, it was incredibly well-seasoned and delicious. The price was more than affordable, and came with a giant bowl of soup, plus two sides. I&#39;m so satisfied that I know next time I want steak quick I&#39;m coming back to Steven&#39;s.

No one looked like they wanted to work there. The woman that served our table was unenthusiastic, abrupt, and frankly the poor old lady sounded tired and lifeless. 
We went here for breakfast and I had the Santa Fe skilled which, for about $10 gets you a skillet consisting of onions, hash browns, cheese, sausage, jalapenos, tomatoes, and two eggs, as well as pancakes (or toast).
The pancakes seem like they were made two years ago. Soggy and tasteless. No fluff at all. 
The skilled was highly mediocre and definitely not worth the price. The artificial melted cheese overpowered everything, and the hash browns were hard - overcooked, old, microwaved, many reasons for that. The jalapenos were cut unproperly so they burned the moutha  little too much. 

Overall not a pleasant experience."

Don&#39;t see the need for a return visit, prices are on the high side. I usually pay less for a bacon waffle and coffee than here. I usually tip 30%+ for breakfast, but not this morning."

I&#39;d like to give a good reason as to why I made a reasonably significant trip from my house like &#34;I happened to be in the area&#34; or &#34;I heard good things from a friend&#34; but if I were to say either, it would be a lie. I made my way out to Steven&#39;s Restaurant largely because I had visited most other pancake houses in my immediate vicinity and specifically went to try some place new.

I snapped some pictures of the outside and walked in, at most breakfast diners I visit there&#39;s a hostess or someone to great you. I got a good chance to look around and snap a few more photos without anyone staring at me, as it was completely empty in front. It took a couple of minutes for someone to come out and show me to a table and hand me a menu. Once I looked over the menu options I settled on a Greek skillet with pancakes, I&#39;m a big fan of gyro meat and have had excellent Greek skillets other places in the past. I also admittedly checked my Yelp app and saw someone else recommend it. A few minutes later the waitress had come by and I ordered. 

Then the wait began, it was well over twenty minutes before my food was ready. With no one up front when I came in, and such a slow turnaround time this was quite disappointing. For a wait that long I was hoping I was in store for an amazing skillet, or at least stellar pancakes.

To start off with the skillet, the egg was scrambled into one big lump on top of my skillet, usually it&#39;s a little better distributed on the top. I took my fork and started slicing it into pieces so that I could better distribute it among the rest of the contents. The Gyro meat used was fine, and the feta cheese used was a good compliment, but there wasn&#39;t enough of either the gyro meat or the cheese. There was a small amount of pepper and onion mixed in as well. This skillet was mostly made up of potato, now that in and of itself isn&#39;t a huge problem is the potato is seasoned well, crisp and tasty. But this was mostly lines of potato hash strewn about the bottom of the skillet, just filler potato with no added flavor. 

The pancakes were average, no powdered sugar or anything fancy. They held together well, were decent sized and the syrup to compliment them was of a good viscosity so as not to water them down and added to the flavor. However, while these were adequate they weren&#39;t enough to save the meal. 

Overall I&#39;ve definitely had a lot better places for skillets, Greek skillets and pancakes than Steven&#39;s Restaurant. And I&#39;ve had quite a few worse. I&#39;d say my food was slightly below average and while service was more than friendly, it was super slow, especially since I was the only customer in the restaurant up to the point where I was served. I&#39;m going to give it two stars and rate it below average. My quote to remember with this place is with slow service like this, they definitely put the &#34;Rest&#34; in the name Stevens Restaurant."

The parking is plentiful and we were seated almost right away. The menu is typical for a Chicagoland Greekateria. There are plenty of choices. I was genuinely surprised that there is no Wi-Fi at this place. Points off for that.

The service was fine. Our server, a woman, was very attentive and friendly.

The food itself was mediocre and uninspired. I had a salad. It was large and I easily could have shared it.

I have to say that the men&#39;s room was not in the best shape. The trash container was overflowing with used paper towels and the soap dispensers were not doing their thing. The floors were dirty. I did not get daring enough to check out the stall.

Had there been reliable Wi-Fi and well kept washrooms, I think that I would have bumped up the stars to three.

Overall, I would say that as less expensive option with a wide ranging menu, this place would be OJ, in a pinch, for most families looking for something quick in the western suburbs.

I think that The Omega, on Ogden Avenue in Downers Grove, will continue to be my choice over Stevens Family Restaurant."

I feel the prices are reasonable, especially when you get a soup/salad and desert for a dinner meal.  

I&#39;m also a fan of their friendliness!  The owner almost always greats us at the door if he&#39;s not occupied with something in back.  Even if he&#39;s not there, someone else greats us in similar manner which adds to the comfort level.  And the waitresses are always just as friendly if not sweet!

The owners are great at making you feel at home and valued as a guest. They just started offering Gelato made fresh and it is to DIE FOR!

Food quality was ok.. both breakfasts were fine, but nothing to write home about.

Verdict:  While this is a fast one, it&#39;s solely because there really isn&#39;t anything overly special about this place.  Fairly simple, and will suffice, but there are better breakfast diner choices in the area to be had.  Won&#39;t likely be back."

My fiance ordered eggs benedict and was very satisfied.  I tried some of his hash browns and thought they were the best hash browns I&#39;ve ever had in a restaurant.  They are seriously that good.  We returned for breakfast this past weekend and this time I ordered eggs with hash browns.  Again awesome.  I ordered my eggs scrambled and they came out very fluffy and full of flavor and the hash browns again were perfection.  My fiance ordered the fiesta omelet and after trying a bite I know I will definitely be ordering an omelet the next time I go. 

The service is good and quick, and the staff is really friendly.  The prices are very reasonable.  The restaurant is also open for lunch and dinner which I have yet to try.  I&#39;ve seen some so-so rating for dinner, so I would recommend definitely trying this place for breakfast."

This place is on 63rd and very close to highway I355. My sister and I went out to have an early breakfast around 6:30am and she didn&#39;t want to have McDonald&#39;s.  So we ended up here after I saw 4 stars from Yelp.

It is a big place and you could see the ages of the interior decoration. The hostess was very sweet cute girl who sat us right way. 

I got their special breakfast Omelets and my sister got her Pecan raisin pancakes. We were staring at our plate for a good minute when our plates were served. They were HUGE.  The pancakes were the size of 10&#34; plates. 4 of them with raisin and pecans on the top.  My Omelet was probably the size of a foot ball with fruit and toast on side.  The omelet was delicious. I loved it which I ate one third of it in the end. My sister was able to eat one quarter of her plate and claimed she is full. We packed to rest which was more than enough for my kids and husband at home.

Our waitress was not super friendly but came back frequently to make sure we have everything we need. 

It is definitely a nice place for sit down breakfast. And now I know I might be order one dish and share it with friend or family."

I am big on coffee rounds, and when my cup is empty you better refill fast. This place does a great job on that too! For those health gurus, they have a Light menu that will sure please your diet routine.

Steven&#39;s gets creative to keep the loyal customers coming back by offering all sorts of specials like Pasta Primavera, Chicken Rigatoni, Pork and Shrimp Brochette, Sandwich Wraps and the list goes on and on.

The gyros are fresh off the spinner - you have to try it! The broasted chicken is absolutely worth the wait. (Hey, call ahead if you can&#39;t stand an extra few minutes of conversation with your spouse.)

The soups, wraps and desserts are all very good.  Never a bad meal here!"

Our party of 8 came here on a Sunday afternoon and I was shocked at how empty it was compared to how huge it was. It must have been a remarkably slow day as I do not know how this place could stay open if this was the rule and not the exception.

Our server was on top of things the whole time. She did a great job and was very efficient and friendly. I ordered a skillet and it was excellent. I ordered soup and it was also excellent. The bill for all of us compared to what we ordered was also excellent. 

By far, It was a most excellent meal! I will be back the next time i am in the area."

I have always brushed off the idea of mixing gyros and breakfast but now I am wondering how I ever lived without them. That being said the greek skillet knocked it out of the park. Perfectly crispy shredded hash browns and creamy feta cheese with gyro meat - what more can you ask for? Oh yah a side of tzatziki sauce.

We also tried the veggie skillet which was just ok - the veggies were either frozen or overcooked. Also the pancakes were huge and very good. They had a sweet aroma when they came out that made them not need as much syrup as usual. Maybe I just tend to drench my pancakes.

Bottom line try the greek skillet. The rest of the menu looked good but I say to just stick with the breakfast menu."

Went for breakfast here today with family and friends. Got a HUGE pile of perfectly crispy hash browns -- some places don&#39;t get the &#34;brown&#34; part right, but these were wonderful-- and pigs in a blanket (hi, I&#39;m 5); the sausage links were a little tough, but the pancakes fluffy and made with a sweet-tasting batter. Our waittress April was good with coffee refills and very tolerant of our lingering at the table for a while chatting. 

A tempting case of delectably-frosted cakes and pies beckoned near the register, but we were too full from breakfast. Next time. This place isn&#39;t far down the road from the Willowbrook Whole Foods, so I could definitely make a pit stop for some greasy breakfast eats after doing some healthful organic shopping."

LOTS to pick from on the menu. It usually is served pretty quick, and in portions no average human should consume! Overall, pretty tasty food and the service is decent. Not over the top friendly, but the servers get the job done.

The food is good and there is plenty of variety. I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s the best place in the world... just your typically Greek style restaurant. They have always been accommodating to our veggie lover who freaks out at the sight of meat. Her special requests can throw the waitress for a loop but the chefs are always willing to adapt (though they probably wonder why anyone wants mostaccioli noodles in her salad). Potions are huge especially for the lunch specials. One of the better places to get that bang for your buck in the area.

For breakfast, the food in general is pretty decent.  The service is hit or miss.  Some times the service is great; other times you wonder if anyone is working.  Today is a rainy day.  I stopped in after giving up a tube of blood after fasting for about 14 hours.  There are 2 waitress, 3 tables with customers, and I had to wait for nearly 10 minutes before a waitress showed up with the coffee and took my order.  The order came in a reasonable time, my coffee cup was refilled and that was it for the waitress.  I guess out of sight means out of mind, but that means I really cut back on the tip.  I wouldn&#39;t have tipped I don&#39;t want the person to think that I &#34;forgot&#34; the tip.  I did tell the hostess the service was slow and didn&#39;t get much of a response.

The French Toast was good - a bit bland, but good.  I do like the packets of  &#34;Chef&#39;s Quality Syrup&#34; -- at least that&#39;s what it said on the label.  Corn syrup and corn fructose syrup and other stuff -- really, chef&#39;s quality.  I am being sarcastic here.  Where is the maple syrup?

The coffee (what little of it I had) tasted like it sat around a bit too long.   If this was the first time coming here, I would have second thoughts about coming back.  I will eventually come back for breakfast just because I have had good breakfasts and good service in the past."

The pancakes were OK---grandma ordered those. She was happy with the four links of sausage she got to complement them. Dad got the pork chops and eggs---which he later said were rather tough and dry. The hash browns he said were OK. My corned beef hash and eggs were done perfectly. The food was delivered in the average time it should take to get a meal. That wasn&#39;t really the problem. The problem was asking three times for water and never getting it. It was a Sunday morning---granted it was busy, but they were still able to seat us right away, so it wasn&#39;t chaotic. When I got up to seek the water, I was immediately asked by a neighboring waitress (not ours) if I needed anything (which was a good sign). It was this waitress who finally brought us the water. So....wouldn&#39;t rule it out in the future as I&#39;d like to try some other things, but the first experience with service was a little more tedious than I thought it would be."

Let me start out with the owners Gus and Cindy. They are very nice people, always concerned about asking how the meal was. Gus&#39; brother runs the kitchen, not to sure on the name, fair to midland cook. 

The reason I like the place is the daily food specials. Everyday of the week they have something different on special. Make sure you try and get there on Saturday for the beef strogenoff, very tasty dish. On Wednesday they have a meatloaf special that&#39;s pretty darn good also. Oh, and Tuesday, they have a stuffed pepper dish that&#39;s REALLY good.The rest of the food is average, your burgers, salads, wraps and what-have-you. The only complaint I would have is a couple of the waitresses you get can ruin your meal. Like, what, did someone give you a wedgie before you left the house?? Your there to serve my lunch and and grab me another coke when I&#39;m out. Don&#39;t treat me like your husband that didn&#39;t pay the car payment and went to the boat and lost it.

That gin and marlboro soaked voice carried throughout the restaurant, I can&#39;t believe they allow their staff to sit there and bitch within earshot of customers.

I can&#39;t tell you how often I see this, and I&#39;m a big tipper, 50% if the service kicks-ass.  This bitch only made 15% off me, and that was only because I can&#39;t just leave a buck.

The place is tiny and can be cramped - There are a couple tables where the chair from one table and another back into each other and I&#39;ve seen people awkwardly not be able to get in or out of their table because their chair is pushing on someone behind them. Could be uncomfortable. Note to self: Always aim for a booth.

But the food here comes quick and is top-notch. I personally prefer their skillets. They&#39;re huge with perfectly crisp hashbrowns and are all around delicious. Get the white toast - it&#39;s thick-cut sourdough. I call it crack toast. YUM!"

I ordered a turkey wrap and I was extremely disappointed. The wrap was filled with mostly lettuces bacon and cheese. There was hardly any turkey. The turkey that was in there was super thin long slices that looked like the cheese. It was very odd. The fries had nooo flavor either!

If you are looking for a more &#34;fancy&#34; and quiet experience with a latte and view of the river - keep driving East.  On the other hand, if you want to cozy up to the bar with a newspaper and put in an order of Cakes and Eggs you&#39;re in the right place."

service was attentive, but also kinda dry.

overall it&#39;s a decent enough place if you live there or are in that area...but definitely not a destination.  family of four with a few glasses of wine, 90 bucks with tip.  i tip 20% unlike all you cheap asses."

Like dignity.  And good tasting pizza.  Not so!  The pizza here is top notch (I recommend getting the crust extra thin).  The food is decent but the pies really shine.  I have not had a bad combination of toppings yet!

The main problem lately seems to be the pick up times/area.  The layout is cramped and problems quickly pile up when they get busy.  Times are frequently delayed (especially on a Friday night), so it can be a frustrating experience.  There have been occasions when I called 1.5-2 hours ahead of time and when I arrived they stated that the pizzas were just about to go in.  Great!"

Last night, we he a get together at our house and decided switch things up a bit and give Little Italian a try to see what the rave is all about. 

Sure enough...they didn&#39;t disappoint.

The pizza was delivered hot and right on time. We had 4 king size 18&#34; pizzas, which were more than enough for the 22 people we had over. Everyone loved the pizza. What&#39;s even better was the pizza was really affordable. It was $90...just over $4 a person. Can&#39;t beat that! 

Looks like we found our new go to pizza joint! Now we have to deal with the regret and years of disappointment from all the years of ordering Rosatis instead of Little Italian."

The pizza is pretty awesome here. Their standard &#34;house&#34; crust is the shizzy! (That means it tastes good.) The interior is very mom &amp; pop ala 1982. Small, kind of sepia-ish, and cozy. With that said, seating might be kind of an issue on busy nights or if you have a larger party. 

They also have a full bar, and if you order draft beer, you get to drink it out of an adorable tiny mug! It&#39;s probably like 12 ounces, but I still feel like Andre the Giant when I use one. Anybody want a peanut?

The best part of this place is that it&#39;s in the same strip mall as a 7-11, so after you eat you can hang out in the 7-11 parking lot with your friends: eat corn nuts, drink dr. pepper and ask grown up going in the store if they&#39;ll buy cigarettes for you.

It&#39;s that place that you recommend to people. You can sit down and eat in their dining room and there is a separate carry out lobby. Pizza ready in about 35 minutes if you call it in. Haven&#39;t been to the bar but there is one and it&#39;s walled off from the dining room. You have to try their pizza. No joke.

Gee, why so negative you ask? The same crappy crust, greasy cheese and boring sauce you&#39;ve experienced at every other forgettable pizza joint in Chicagoland are all you&#39;ll get here.  Dining in is even less appealing.  Somebody said cute decor?  You&#39;re kidding right?

For those who consider this good pizza, all I can say is wow, you really owe it to yourself to seek out some better alternatives.  I have had pizza in literally hundreds of restaurants all over this country and others, and this place is almost at the bottom of my list.  (Pizza with hamburger on it eaten on the west coast was worse)

Not recommended."

We had tried Little Italian in the past and it was good, but not compelling enough to end our search. We gave them another try 10 days ago and the pizza was great.  They got everything right this time: we asked for light cheese (about 1/2 as much; we&#39;re not fans of the Chicagoland standard of 1/4+&#34; layer of cheese over the entire pie)--they did not overdo it; the sauce was tasty and ample, yet the crust wasn&#39;t soggy; sausage had nice fennel seasoning and there was plenty of it (don&#39;t know how some places can use fennel-free sausage...); fresh mushrooms, too. the crust had a good flavor and was perfectly cooked through: hint of crunchy in places, yet not overdone. It was also done right on time and hot enough to make the 7 minute trip home and eat right out of the box. Little Italian is locally owned, has a good reputation in town and the customer service is capable and nice. We&#39;ll be back."

Having said that this place has some other issues. They can&#39;t seem to get pick-up times right. They have told me times to show up before and I have had to wait an extra ten minutes or so on more than one occasion. Most other pizza places I pick up from have the pizza ready when they say it will be ready. I realize Little Italian can be a really busy place though, but they could use some improvement with organization. I have ordered from here many times and there have been a few occasions when my order has been messed up or forgotten about and I ended up waiting 20 minutes for no good reason, so I have experienced some slight problems with picking up a pizza from here.

Eating in at the restaurant goes very smoothly though. The wait staff is excellent and the food is really good! So I would mostly recommend Little Italian, especially because the pizza is as good as it gets!"

The pizza is excellent; the crust has great flavor and texture, the sauce has excellent flavor and the toppings are fresh.  

In addition to the pizza, we came in on a separate occasion to have pasta.  The service in the dining area is great.  The servers were attentive and conscientious. The food came relatively quickly and was delicious.  I ordered the chicken Alfredo and it was very good and well-cooked.

I was sad to see how poorly they handled it. The &#34;owners wife&#34; as she called herself was rude to customers and yelled at two while I was there. I didn&#39;t complain about them being late, but was totally turned off by her attitude to others who did. Unfortunately for them - the customer is always right.

The staff is nice but we&#39;ve had a few incidents... once a hair in the pizza BUT we called they drove all the way to my house in a rush to deliver a new one. 

A few times we&#39;ve gotten the wrong order, and once my boyfriend picked up a pizza and tripped on their slightly icy sidewalk while heading out the door and while he didn&#39;t fall, the pizza flew and over half of it slipped right out of the box and on the ground. I had been waiting in the car so when he came back and had no pizza he was reasonably embarrassed (no one likes tripping in public) and wanted to know what we should do since our pizza was now on the ground in front of the store. He&#39;s pretty positive that the counter staff saw, said nothing, and then walked away... which is why he didn&#39;t immediately head back in. I worked a at pizza place for 10 years and if a customer had tripped on ice outside our door, we would have kissed their ass and made them a new pizza in a jiff. Not little Italian. 

I went back in with my main man and immediately the girls at front went to get the manager. Maybe it was because they saw us walk back in after scraping the pizza up but maybe it was because they originally saw him trip (due to THEIR icy sidewalk) and did nothing. The manager came up and was friendly but I don&#39;t think she got it or cared much. She chuckled and said needed to take a look. She goes into the back with our pizza and comes back with the same box and says she was able to salvage some of the pizza... that very same pizza that laid on the dirty, snowy, icy sidewalk outside that everyone walks on. Uhm, Earth to Lady... just because it doesn&#39;t look infected, doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t. No, 80% of that pizza touched the ground because of your failure to salt your sidewalk all the way and you just gave it back to me to consume? 
We look at her, half smiling, not knowing if she was kidding or not when she asks if we want to put in another pizza. Phew! Yes, please! We wait a little less than 15 minutes, she brings the pizza out, tells us to be careful with it, we smile and get ready to leave when she says $16. PS- she wasn&#39;t kidding about the salvaged pizza... she actually gave it back to us to eat the rest of it. Welcome to Crazy town. 

WTF?!?!?! You have got to be mother freaking kidding me. I was in shock... I didn&#39;t know what to say. My boyfriend paid the $16 ( I think his esteem was lowered by the tripping) but what I wanted to do was roundhouse kick the pizza out of her hand and tell Little Italian to suck it. I still cannot believe that they still charged us... she did give us a small percentage off our pizza BUT it should have been free since we already paid full price for the pizza their icy walk ruined AND they should have apologized their asses off. 

It&#39;s really a shame because they are really close and I like their thin crust (not the Little Italian Crust) pizza. For food they deserve a 4 star rating but for poor and negligent management skills they get a 2. 

Rest in Peace Little Italian."

We were introduced to Little Italian through a our child&#39;s PDO program/ church fundraiser.    We are pretty new to Naperville and had never tried this place before, but since it was a fundraiser event we decided to get carry-out. We ordered two specialty sandwiches (chicken italiano &amp; italian char-broiled chicken sandwich both came with fries), an order of breaded zucchini, spinach/tomato/onion thin crust pizza.  oh, and the brownie cheese cake; yeah, we went all out- but only becuase it was for the sake of the fundraiser-really! :)  Well, to our surprise the food was pretty darn good.  The poorest part of our order were that the fries were so/so &amp; little soggy by time I got home and got dinner out- but I just heated up a frying pan to crisp the fries back into shape and they were good.  The sandwiches were very good, my husband especially liked the italian char-broiled chicken sandwich.

I hadn&#39;t had Little Italian in years.  I grew up with it in Darien, IL which was where it all started back in the 70&#39;s when Mike Maglieri built his dream.

We had one large cheese, one large sausage &amp; pepperoni and one large with everything.  Also ordered were a couple salads.

The pizza is medium crust in general (you can order it thin or thick) and it arrived hot although a little later than anticipated.  The salads were good and they sent along individually portioned salad dressings of all types (which worked great for our group of 9 adults).

I can&#39;t speak to eating in the restaurant as Emily has, but if you go to a pizza place and don&#39;t order pizza, I would imagine your experience may vary.  I can&#39;t imagine what it would be for someone who doesn&#39;t eat meat, although there are plenty of pizza options for that unless you&#39;re a strict vegan.

The Cellar Door offers pretty good wine and beer selections along with a delicious menu of food including meats, cheeses, small plates, sandwiches, salads, pizza, and dessert. Their patio is on the smaller side, but it&#39;s a nice option for enjoying a glass of wine outside on a beautiful day.

Service both times I&#39;ve stopped in have been great. Everyone is always friendly and attentive. My only suggestion would be for the staff to give some further explanation as to what The Cellar Door is all about -- for folks who are visiting for the first time. 

Their walls are lined with tons of bottles of wine for purchase, but I just wish someone would have explained to me exactly what they have to offer and where the different types of wine and price points are located. I felt a tad awkward browsing the small space without any direction while other people were sitting at the tables in front of the wall. If I was just passing by (and hadn&#39;t done my research on Yelp), I think I would have been confused as to whether this was a restaurant, wine bar, or wine shop. Of course it&#39;s all 3, which is is why the servers should be proud to explain all they have to offer!

I have to say, I really enjoyed their beets and goat cheese salad. For $10 this salad includes spring greens topped with beets, goat cheese, and walnuts all drizzled with cream of balsamic. I&#39;m a sucker for goat cheese, but this combo of flavors was really delicious!

I will for sure be back again -- wine, cheese, and charcuterie are a few of my favorite things!"

The place is definitely small and rustic, probably not somewhere you&#39;d go for the decor alone.

Good drink options. I really enjoyed the white sangria. It was light and refreshing. The price was fair too. 

We had the pepperoni pizza as an appetizer. It was mediocre but not bad. 

All of my friends and I decided to order sandwiches. The sandwiches were really big that if you just wAnted a snack or a light meal you could split it with someone. They weren&#39;t loaded with meat but we thought the sandwiches were tasty. 

They serve the sandwiches with ruffles potato chips which is kind of cheap. They should make something instead like potato salad or soup. I get that it&#39;s a small kitchen but soup or potato salad would be totally doable. So for that reason I thought the sandwiches were a little over priced."

I enjoyed a glass of Rose on their patio, which is tiny and a little bit cramped, so this isn&#39;t an ideal spot to work or have a private conversation.  There is additional seating inside and at the bar.  I took a sip of my husband&#39;s Tincho, a sparkling white wine cocktail, so refreshing and perfect for spring &amp; summer!

I like that the menu is simple, if you&#39;re ordering beer or wine to enjoy on-site.  They also sell bottles of wine, which you can consume on-site or take home (price varies depending on if you&#39;re staying or taking it to-go)."

If you can&#39;t find street parking, there is a parking garage about a block away.

Unfortunately it wasn&#39;t nice enough outside to sit out there, though some braved the 60 something degree evening with rain to actually wine and dine out there.  I had just got back from vacation the day before so making reservations slipped my mind.  Thankfully there was a small table for two available at 7pm on a Friday night...this place got pretty crowded so a reservation is probably necessary during peak time.

My friend and I indulged in a few glasses of red wine, ordered the bruchetta along with a few meats and cheeses.  It was the perfect size meal for two!

There are also daily specials. My friend and I shared a selection of 3 cheeses served with crackers, artisan bread, marcona almonds &amp; dried cranberries to start. I then ordered a small plate of salmon tartare, which was a generous portion served with crackers, caviar and sour cream. I was disappointed to get crackers instead of the toast points as described on the menu. I would have preferred that. I did like the presentation of the food and the taste.

You got to be kidding me. Time to hire knowledgable people or actually be a wine place. 


The pizza came out as a flat bread ... Not a 10 inch pizza ... I started at 3 stars and now I&#39;m down to 2! Only because service is crap, atmosphere is horrible and it seems it&#39;s not how it used to be.

Was good! We went for charcuterie. It has become a thing with me, and I was pleased to see some real legitimate options. I placed an order and the guy brought it out saying &#34; you didn&#39;t order this but I gave you some  violet mustard cause it&#39;s great&#34; and it was! 

Wifey and I had a good experience! I would recommend simply on charcuterie. We are not wine snobs but it seemed to have many there who were and were there for specific &#34;wine snobbery scores&#34;! Our server was Cory and service was ok, could have been more attentive but I think he was flying solo and trying his best. 

Go check this place out. Order charcuterie. The world needs more charcuterie and this place has it.

The back room is a wonderful place for a small group to sit, drink, and talk.  If you&#39;ve got a semi-large group of friends together, I highly recommend it.  It&#39;s very comfortable.  It can be kind of loud, sometimes, but they will turn down the music if you ask.  I haven&#39;t had the food, but the wine and beer selection is quite nice.  They generally have some unusual beers on draft, especially sours, which are my favorite.  Everything is local.  The staff are very well educated about the wine and can offer recommendations.  The service is a little bit slow.  There have been a couple of times when I&#39;ve been ready to leave, but the server doesn&#39;t show up to take the credit cards, but it generally doesn&#39;t bother me because it&#39;s the kind of place where you go for a nice conversation, which makes time pass quickly.  

Parking is difficult.  They have a small private lot in the back, but I have yet to find it due to the one way streets and train traffic in downtown Downer&#39;s Grove and end up parking in the public garage and walking.  They also have outside seating in the front, but it&#39;s usually all full, even on weeknights when the restaurant its self is not."

I&#39;ve been here quite a few times now with a book club that meets in the back room. If you have a larger group, the back room is the way to go and they let you reserve it if you call ahead. The seating in the rest of the restaurant is smaller cocktail tables that would only seat 4 comfortably. They have a nice menu that&#39;s mainly small plates/sandwiches.

At a wine bar I appreciate a certain amount of style and information.  I&#39;m not looking to point to something on the menu and have it simply brought to me.  This wasn&#39;t laid back and encouraging to linger.  It was like a diner.  I told our server the type of flavor I appreciate and mentioned a type of wine that I&#39;ve found it in before.  She immediately said they have a very good wine of that type and marched off to get it.  She brought to our table an open bottle (Huh??) and poured out two full glasses without even inviting me to sample some.  Either she didn&#39;t know what she was doing or we were served another table&#39;s reject...though we did like the wine.

The Smoked Salmon Tartare is excellent.  Their presentation of it varies.  My companion ordered the Wild Mushroom Grilled Cheese and found it to be boring.  She didn&#39;t seem to enjoy finishing it and said she wouldn&#39;t order it again.  We both had the Quinoa Salad and enjoyed that."

I was surprised at the great selection of food! I ordered the Cuban Suerte and asked the server for a recommendation on a wine pairing.  She pointed me to a Zin.  I don&#39;t yet understand how you can taste things like dusty earth in a drink but for a novice wine snob I thought the recommendation was a good one.  I also tried the Christmas Ale on tap. It was watered down but I still enjoyed it.  I would come back again!  

Service: Meh but probably varies depending on how busy it is/the time of year.

Food: Fabulous!  Good mix for snobby goat cheese eating gluten/vegan/plant-based/whatever special diet types and also plain ole food for us more simplier folk. My sandwich came with mixed greens that were delicious. 

Location: Awesome.  A DG native, I always like downtown DG spots. Nice and cozy. This is sorta next to a graveyard but it&#39;s a historic founders graveyard and not creepy or visible from the inside.

Service was very good - been there 3 times - a tad slow but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a reflection on any server we had, just a bit understaffed. Server gave excellent recommendations on wine.

Food is surprisingly good - classic menu with excellent variety - the panini and pizzas are fantastic. The Charcuterie options are also a favorite.

Decent atmosphere - you can come in solo and watch a game on the bar TV... for date night and feel like it&#39;s a treat, or... bring a group of friends and get loud (but not feel bad about doing so).

I would say its my favorite bar in Downers but its not really a traditional bar. however, it is still the go to place for me and my husband (and friends). nice casual atmosphere - side walk seating in the summer is great!! I will say it does get crowded around dinner time on the weekends but usually thins out around 10pm. I have been for a quick drink before a movie at the Tivoli and for drinks with friends for the night. the cheese board is amazing - highly recommend. all the food I have had here has been good as well, the bruschetta is also a highlight. the only &#34;complaint&#34; I have (along with other people I know) is that the chairs at the tables are not really comfortable. they just seem slightly on the small side. however, that has not stopped any of us from coming here. beer and wine selection are great - they get some cool summer beers too. the tap selection changes. 

some reviewers said the wait staff is pushy and they want to turn tables like a diner but I have never had that problem or seen it happen. I generally find you have to call them to your table on a rare occasion, feels more like European cafe service than pushy diner. so get a glass of wine or beer and a plate of cheese and enjoy!"

Cool place to hang out with some friends or even a date night. However, it was a busy Friday Evening and it took someone to finally take my order after waiting 20mins. I think if I didn&#39;t have a Groupon and it is was about to expire. I would of walked out and found someplace else to have a drink.

He had been excited to try this place for a little while now, given that they have a really good beer list despite being a wine cellar.  We went specifically to get the Off Color Dino S&#39;mores, which he hasn&#39;t seen anywhere else and has been dying to try (it was delicious...it seriously tasted like s&#39;mores, and this is coming from a person who doesn&#39;t like dark beers and generally doesn&#39;t think &#34;chocolate&#34; beers taste like chocolate).

We had seen the Goat Cheese Pomodoro dip online and decided to get that with drinks (I went with a Surprise White and ended up getting a glass of Chardonnay of some sort).  Our drink order was taken right away, and the drinks were brought out quickly, but it took 15 minutes or so for someone to come take our food order.  We considered leaving after finishing our drinks, but we eventually got our order taken and since it looked so yummy and I was starving, we stayed.  It took another 10-15 minutes for it to finally come out, but when it did, we devoured it.  Soooo good.  We ended up ordering a second round of drinks.

As our food came out, we realized that Wednesday night is Trivia night, so I&#39;m hoping that explains why the service was slow--the wait staff probably anticipates people lingering all night, and we had taken one of the last tables before the place filled up.  The dip was really good, the beer list impressive, and the wine approachable for a novice like me.   The restaurant itself was quaint and I can see us coming back, just not on a trivia night."

Our first trip was during a cruise night in DG and we sat at an outside table with our dog. Everything was generally pretty good. I think we ordered a cheese plate and the server didn&#39;t really know what cheeses they were, which was annoying.

Recently I ended up here twice in one night. First just for a glass of wine, then again later for a glass of wine and a snack. The food was good, the wine was good, the service was good...it was good. :-)  They have a decent beer selection, but I kind of remember thinking that it seemed like they should have more wines by the glass. Additionally, you can buy a bottle of wine from the retail wall and open it there, but they charge $10 corkage fee or something, which I think is ridiculous.

I also got six bottles of wine here as a Groupon or You Swoop or some such thing. Some of the wines were ok, one for sure was really good and I may have one or two bottles left.

Never disappointed always impressed! I will continue to bring friends and family there and always look forward to a night at The Cellar Door."

Sidewalk seating was really noisy so we sat just inside the window where we could people watch. Wine was good, the Goose Island Class of 88 beer was ok. Very citrusy, which indeed was noted on the menu. We had decent food, the house salad which had &#34;fun lettuce&#34; ( mesclun style mix) with vinagrette, and the Asian Chicken wrap, which had an ass kicking chipotle suace that was just excellent. Not Asian at all but very tasty. My wife liked her glass of wine so much she bought a bottle to take home. Prices average for main st DG. Not a bad little spot, especially if you like your wine."

First time at The Cellar Door, we sat inside because all the outside seating was taken, it was a beautiful night to sit outside, maybe next time. I had a beer, which they have a good selection but their specialty is wine. They have hundreds of wine choices and can match any taste. It&#39;s a great place to stop to take a break from shopping in Downtown Downers grove."

We stopped in Friday night July 11, 2014 at about 8:30pm. Little did we know there was a car show in the area. With that said it was challenging to find parking. After driving around we did find parking at the 4 story parking garage about 2 blocks away. Our reservation was ready when we arrived. The place is quaint they had outdoor and indoor seating. The out door seating was taken, so we sat indoors. The tables are pretty small, perfect for wine. Challenge is your gonna eat a good full meal. On the hand of food, we ordered flat breads. The bread was kind of thick, taste was acceptable. The sangria&#39;s were very refreshing. All in all the food was acceptable. We closed the evening with Tiramisu. again not bad. 

The only negative was the wait time at the end of the night in getting our slice of Tiramisu. I think we waited over ten minutes. By no means am I cheap, but if the establishment was mine I would have comped the Tiramisu based on the wait. Then again, maybe it was frozen and had to thaw? My only advise to the establishment is parallel Customer Service......staff was so so in friendliness, nothing special relating to knowledge or recommendations. The establishment is not that big that the staff is so busy. Check on your customers more."

We had the goat cheese appetizer, it was amazing!! 
I also had the capreese salad which was one of the best I&#39;ve had.

It is classy, but yet plays sports on the tv. It is intimate, but yet wide open so you see some of the bar and kitchen. It has at least 100 different wines, and plenty of microbrews!!

I have been here a few times with my girlfriends and for a birthday dinner with my mom.  The wine is always delicious (even when I get a surprise glass) and I&#39;ve been known to buy the full bottles afterwards! The list is changing every time I stop in, but they still have the favorites that they can open for you.

If you&#39;re looking for something to eat and like seafood TRY THE SMOKED SALMON PANINI! It&#39;s fantastic.... I&#39;m craving one now!

This place is also awesome for a last minute present. Just stop in here and ask for advice! The left side of the place is a great wall of wine with so many reds, whites and rose you can imagine!"

They have a decent selection of craft beers in bottles and 8-10 on tap. I asked the guy standing right in front of me and the tap what style one of the tap beers was as it just had the name of the beer on the tap handle. This guy didn&#39;t even look at me....Totally ignored me......and the place was empty. The other guy that was about 20 feet away finally answered after the silence went on for too long. We walked out based solely on the poor staff. 
I have been drinking craft beers since way before it became popular and this place could&#39;ve been a place that I would have visited on a regular basis to sample the tap beers. Too bad."

This place offers a warm, intimate and sophisticated environment best for nights out with a few friends or for dates.

My one complaint is the service. The waitress was unbelievably rude. Since it was my first time at The Cellar Door it took me a little while to figure out what I wanted to order and the waitress actually told me that she had other people waiting on me and for me to hurry it up. She gave me and my friends an attitude all night long! On my 21st birthday!

The experience I had with the server didn&#39;t reflect well on The Cellar Door. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be back but not anytime soon. It&#39;s definitely a great place worth going but I hope no one has the same experience I had."

Was it the indifferent waiters or the bees in the restaurant or the gnats all over?  I can&#39;t decide what was worse.

I have been to the Cellar Door several times, on my first few visits, the service was so-so.  However, on my most recent visits, the service was MUCH better!!

I have tried a variety of the items here and feel they always have a great selection of wine and my husband and always happy with at least one of the craft beers they have on tap.  We also discovered one of our favorite beers here (Lagunitas Sucks...if you haven&#39;t tried it, you should!!)

We&#39;ve eaten a pizza here, it was fine (not great, but it wasn&#39;t bad either).  We have also eaten some of the Indian food options, yummy!!  We almost always order meat and cheese when we come here and enjoy it, mind you, we&#39;re not meat or cheese connoisseurs, but we think it&#39;s good!!

The only thing I don&#39;t enjoy about Cellar Door are the barrel tables, in fact, I kind of hate them.  They are really uncomfortable to sit at and I can never get in a good position. I always think about how awkward it would be to sit at these tables on a first or second date!

Tables aside, the atmosphere is laid back, the menu items are tasty, and the service has improved, four stars for me!"

Nice selection of wines and a great wine bar menu. We had a selection of cheeses and meats along with a vegetarian panini. Everything was very good as was the service. They honored our Groupon without any issues. 

We did end up sitting right next to the cash register which wasn&#39;t ideal.  We had a drink at the bar while waiting for that table. I would imagine the place is a real zoo on the weekends. Make a reservation!"

My only gripe is that they had have house red and white for $3 on Mondays, so I ordered the house merlot.  Well apparently there is only one specific red that is $3.  Why would&#39;t you just say which one it is on the menu then? It misleading makes you think that all the house reds and whites are on sale. None the less I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be back."

The service has always been horrible. Not just once, but all 4 times my boyfriend and I have been here. Last night though, made me rethink EVER going back.

I called about 6:30pm (I had a Groupon that said to call) to make a reservation, the person on the phone said they were not accepting reservations, first come, first serve. No biggie. 

My boyfriend and I get there around 7pm on a Friday. It&#39;s busy, we figured that. As soon as we walk in, the man (found out the manager) asked if we had reservations, I explained no and that I had called, and what she told me on the phone. He interrupts me by saying, with an attitude, &#34;Well. I am just asking because we had reservations earlier and I&#39;m just making sure. OK?&#34; Ok... He just walked away and told a bus boy to get a table from outside.

So there we were... Sitting right at the entrance on freezing cold and short little table and chairs since it&#39;s 20 degrees out. I felt like we were at a kiddie table.

We ordered, the waitress was actually wonderful--Jennifer. The first and only server we have ever had here that was sweet. Well, we get the check, I give her the Groupon and credit card. After almost 10 mins, I overhear the manager telling her to &#34;show them that they signed, this has been redeemed.&#34; Now, keep in mind I have purchased TWO of their Groupons at two different times so I must have printed out the wrong one, that we did indeed use already. (Who would know? It says they have both not been redeemed on my account.) 

My apologies, I try to pull up my account on my phone--of course it&#39;s not working. So my boyfriend runs home (lives down the block) to print out the other one and bring it in--I know that one has NOT been redeemed. We bring it in, my boyfriend is waiting in the car and the manager is still scouring their pages of papers trying to see when I used THIS Groupon... I obviously did not, which is why they couldn&#39;t find my signature again. After 10 min of waiting, I go over and ask what the matter is, the manager walks away and the waitress redeemed it, apologizing profusely. I gave her a good tip, I would hate working there with that man. They also made me sign the back of the Groupon and put down my info--I scribbled my signature and email... Why would they need all that.

This was SO aggravating... Seriously, Cellar Door if you want to eliminate confusion on Groupons, either don&#39;t offer them or actually REDEEM THEM. Do not make people sign pieces of paper... REDEEM them so it shows up on our accounts. It&#39;s not that hard--Groupon will give you a device to use, believe me, I&#39;ve worked at a restaurant that did this. 

The manager was absolutely rude from the time we walked through the door. You could tell that the employees were annoyed by him and was edgy as a result. He kept bobbing around and giving us dirty looks... Honestly, I was practically sitting on the floor... Give me a break. 

We had gone a few times for dine in and at least twice for carry out.... But after that experience I don&#39;t want to bother again."

We lived close by before. We came ever Other Tuesday. We now don&#39;t live very close so now we have to travel. The last few times have been bad!  In the winter it&#39;s freezing!!!!!! We were there this past Tuesday. Wow! The service was horrible. It took five minutes for a server, then were handed menus and the server started walking away without even asking us what we wanted to drink. We then ordered our drinks, he dropped them off and again started to walk away again, we stopped him and said we are ready to order. He responded huh? We then recieved our food. I had a hair in mine and was forced to sit there until the server came back 10 minutes later. We also asked for extra cheese, and didn&#39;t receive it. A manager never stopped by the table to apologize about the hair. Nor did anything get comped. The quickest I saw the server move was to pick up his money. Which I left him 10%, I usually tip 30%. I&#39;m not sure if this guy is family, but he should not be serving. I would of had another sangria as well as my fiancé if the server ever came back for the sale."

The main thing from a full 5 star review was the seating. They didn&#39;t have much, and we got jipped - even with a reservation! I don&#39;t exactly know all the details of their thought process, but all I know is that we made a reservation, and got a high table next to the door and window. FREEZING! Others came in after us, and got the cool barrell tables for a much more intimate setting. I should mention that the restaurant was not packed.

The food came out quick, and you can tell it was made with high quality ingredients. Even though it boasts to be a wine cafe, it offered a nice selection of craft beers for the non-wine drinkers. 

Parking, as usual for Downers Grove, is tough, but anything is walkable.

Tuesdays are great, as it&#39;s 1/2 price sangria night...though the taste (of the sangrias) can vary quite a bit from week to week.  We&#39;ve tried several different dishes...there&#39;s a wide variety, and everything is fresh.    The cheese platter is very good, as you get to select which cheeses you want to try.
(serving sizes seem small, but are probably appropriate.  We Americans are so used to huge portions, that when you get smaller servings, you almost feel cheated.)

Cellar Door is a nice place to hang out over a drink- whether you&#39;re catching up with an old friend or on a &#34;date&#34; with your honey.

6/23/15... Just got back from enjoying another sangria, celebrating hubby&#39;s birthday.  Sangria were just so- so, and I have to say that the waitress, Courteny, was pretty unfriendly!  Barely looked at us as she served us.   Didn&#39;t refill hubby&#39;s water after he&#39;d asked and just had a sour puss the few times that she came by to ask if we wanted anything else.  Maybe it was because we didn&#39;t order food?  Maybe she doesn&#39;t like people?

I found a yummy red blend that I purchased a bottle of not knowing if I could find it easily elsewhere.  Turns out I paid TWICE as much as it sells for elsewhere.  I don&#39;t begrudge a business making a profit, but that was a bit offensive.  Service was good, and the décor cute.

This probably made our experience different from some other reviewers. For example, it was a lazy Sunday. We also had no pre- and post- management preconceptions (yay for us?). There were plenty of open tables, the staff was relaxed, and two different guys helped us out.  We ordered the 4-piece cheese and charcuterie flight and 2 mimosas between the two of us, and it was perfect for a light lunch.  In retrospect, don&#39;t order mimosas when you do cheese tasting. The two don&#39;t go together very well (bleh). On the one hand, I think it would have been helpful for the staff to educate the diners since we said we&#39;ve never been there before and maybe gently recommend ordering something that doesn&#39;t taste like *ahem* mimosas if you are having your own little cheese tasting party for two. Anyway, not their fault, so I&#39;m not deducting points there. 

One of the guys explained a little more about the cheese choices and left us to discuss (this is a very important decision you know).  My husband likes slightly stronger cheeses and I like slightly milder cheeses, so we agreed that he should have his stinky cheese and I&#39;ll have my yummy cheese. Jk. They were both good. Mine was just naturally better because I chose it. :P He ordered the Humboldt Fog and I ordered the Midnight Moon for cheese, and then Prosciutto and Sopressata for the meats. The board came out with a few crackers, bread slices, nuts, craisins, and the meats and cheese. It was truthfully very yummy.  

My one complaint is that the chairs were quite uncomfortable. I don&#39;t know if this is a tall-people issue, but it&#39;s like the seat was too short, so it cut into the back of your thighs.  Everything else was pretty nice though. Check it out."

The service feels more obligatory than it used to, and I feel I often need to catch the attention of the staff, as opposed to having them check in with me. 

In the past, the Cellar Door felt like a warm, cozy environment in which to enjoy wine and nice, light meals among adults. I really enjoyed this environment under the prior manager, Alex.  

Alex used to greet us on walking in. The new manager cannot be bothered to learn the names of regulars. Alex would stop by to check on our meal and experience; the only time I have spoken to the new manager is when I&#39;ve had to come in from outside to get his attention for service and when he stopped by one time to &#34;cut me off&#34; from ordering further drinks of wine.

In fact, the impetus for writing this review was the experience where the new Cellar Door manager stopped by to &#34;cut me off&#34; from ordering, which happened last night. I have never in my life been &#34;cut off&#34; from ordering drinks, as I am purposefully mindful of my consumption and behavior while drinking.

Having the manager approach our table to specifically cut me off from ordering further wine in front of other customers was SO embarrassing! And I was not acting disorderly; I had ordered two meals over the course of several hours and was drinking a lot of water with every glass of wine. I was having a relaxing evening with my godmother and her husband. After the new manager cut me off from ordering another glass of wine, I asked him why - was I behaving in some way that was not acceptable? He said no; my behavior was not an issue - and I also know I had been respectful.

I am confused about why the manager would stop a respectful customer from spending money with the business he represents. I can only take away from this experience the understanding that the Cellar Door does not want me to continue to spend money on their wine, as the manager was unable to explain his reasoning for why he would no longer sell to me during my last visit. And to note, the wine at the Cellar Door is marked up significantly and rather expensive. 

After being publicly humiliated at the Cellar Door, I am hesitant to return. I would like to continue to spend my money with local restaurants who would appreciate my business  - any recommendations for alternate places where adults can enjoy a relaxing glass of wine and a light meal are very welcome.

It&#39;s a small restaurant with lots of shelves lined with bottled wine, a small bar and a few tables. It&#39;s cozy. I really enjoy the sangria here and all of the food I&#39;ve ordered has been good also. The only thing I really have a problem with is the lack of service I&#39;ve received here each time. It leaves me with a bad vibe, I feel like I&#39;m always being ignored. I don&#39;t think I should have to stop the waiter to order my food, another drink or ask for silverware. And it&#39;s been every time. I&#39;ll still come back but I hope they step up the service."

Everyone seemed to enjoy themselves there. Waitresses had great knowledge, made good suggestions. We ordered cheese, meats &amp; tiramisu. All of it was fantastic! Wine prices were a little high, but typical for this type of specialty wine bar. Wide range of beers to buy or on tap. Loved it, we&#39;ll to back!"

They have a very good wine selection, excellent food, and great overall ambiance.  I know the owners a bit and they are very nice people.  Probably the best pub quiz night I&#39;ve ever been too.

My friends and I frequent this place pretty often, and just love it. Whether you sit inside or outside, the atmosphere is perfect for a neighborhood wine bar. 

The only reason I downgraded the star is that the servers are hit or miss - we&#39;ve had a lot of good ones, and a lot of bad ones. Nothing in between. 

But, the owner hangs around and frequently brings out plates, we&#39;ve had conversations with the chef when he comes out to check on our food. I love their current fall menu! Butternut squash soup for me, and &#39;the perfect grilled cheese&#39; for my friend - we haven&#39;t been disappointed yet. In the summer we hang out on the patio with a cheese platter or bruschetta and a couple glasses of wine, just people watching. Last Wednesday we went for trivia and tried an appetizer of grilled asparagus wrapped in ham and drizzled with balsamic glaze. Yum!

A fun thing this place does is the &#39;Surprise White&#34; or &#34;Surprise Red&#34; wine by the glass (I believe its 8 dollars). Perfect for someone like me who isn&#39;t picky, but is extremely indecisive."

The Cellar Door offers a decent amount of wines in the $6-$9 a glass range and we were pleasantly surprised when my husband&#39;s sangria rang up at $3!

We were very happy with their cheese and meat selection. We opted for the 7 for $20 combo flight, which probably was the best cheese/charcuterie plate we have had value wise. I do have one small complaint and I find this happens often at &#34;cheese&#34; places. Our cheese plate was delivered by one of the kitchen staff. If you are serving a cheese plate, you must be able to tell the customer which cheese is which. The man put the plate down and walked away. My husband and I have had a great deal of cheese/know enough to know what we are eating but several people who are trying cheeses for the first time won&#39;t be as informed. The waiter who brought the neighboring table their cheese did describe each of them for that table, but it needs to be consistent.

The wild mushroom grilled cheese was awesome. The sandwich had lots of mushrooms and the bread was great. I wish they had a larger dessert selection, but we will definitely be back (especially if there are more Groupons)!"

The service here was pretty darn terrible.  I always hate when you get a strange server &amp; it affects the whole dinner.  Conversations start being awkward, people wonder &#34;why did she ask for my drink order twice?&#34; &#34;why did she skip over me for a food order?&#34; instead of being able to focus on the friends that they&#39;re out with.

On top of an awkward turtle staff, the food was so-so.  Sure they have a great selection of cheeses, but, really?  All you have to do is buy expensive cheeses and put them on a tray.  Not too difficult.  The paninis were relatively greasy and unimpressive.  I&#39;d say save your money for good wine &amp; cheese, and go to Lemon Tree a few blocks away."

The drink prices aren&#39;t outrageous and they seem to have nightly specials that make the place that much more attractive. 

I&#39;ve only been once, but I plan on returning. My group sat outside and enjoyed the fresh air. We ordered the bruchetta, the spinach artichoke dip, the goat cheese marinara with bread, and an assorted mix of a cheese and meat platter. The prices for the food aren&#39;t outrageous either. They also have sandwiches and salads, neither of which we tried. 

I have a few complaints though. The service was less than mediocre and it almost seemed as if it was painful for our waitress to take our order. It wasn&#39;t super busy, so she couldn&#39;t have used that as her excuse for the lack of cheerfulness. When I asked about a few different wines, her response to all my questions was, &#34;Yep!&#34; which led me to believe she had no idea, didn&#39;t care, or had never tried them- any or all could apply.

Once outside, we were told by the hostess that the rules had changed and we should get in the line.  Went back inside and tried to sit at two empty bar stools and were told they were occupied.

I love the atmosphere here, and it always seems full whenever I walk by.  I headed in for the first time with some friends and was lucky enough to come in on Trivia Night! The room was clearly filled with regulars and the atmosphere was warm and friendly. There wasn&#39;t a table, but fear not! The incredible owner of the place created space and brought in a table for us. Other customers were excited to move their table and make space for us! I saw the owner stick around the whole night, make conversation with patrons, and saw a great relationship with his staff as well. All of that love and passion is reflected in the culture of the place and the warm feeling.

In addition to the service- which was a huge plus- we also ordered drinks and food. The wine selection is wonderful and the Riesling I ordered was delicious. We also ordered the Asparagus/Goat Cheese/Fresh Berries salad as well as the Baked Goat Cheese Pomodoro- both looked beautiful and tasted great...and were very reasonably priced. 

I will definitely be returning next week for trivia night, and it makes me wish I lived in Downers Grove for more than one month a year during the Winter so I could become a regular!"

We came in yesterday for a bar crawl for my 21st. I had been in contact with the owners off and on for the past month making sure everything was set and they were SO unbelievably nice. They were probably the most phone-friendly bar we dealt with! They seemed excited to have us come in, saved us the back room, and even made sure we didn&#39;t collide with the other bar crawl in town that night.

However, upon our arrival it was clear from the first moment we walked in that we were NOT welcomed by the bartenders/wait staff. Rude comments, sarcastic tones, and a general lack of caring made it a bad stop on the crawl. At one point the waiter asked me to carry drinks back to my friends, since he obviously couldn&#39;t be bothered to do so. We did our best to be polite and courteous as we knew the setting wasn&#39;t anything party-ready. I was sorely disappointed that they couldn&#39;t return the favor, as we brought them probably $200+ worth of business.

I will not be returning again and I don&#39;t think many who were on the crawl will be either. 

And before anyone comments, yes I am aware that this is a wine bar and not a pub type establishment but we were eagerly welcomed by the owners and assured that bar crawls have come through before and enjoyed their time at the bar."

The saving grace of the Cellar Door is the atmosphere...and the trivia game.  Other than that:  the food was overpriced for the quality;

 I had the trio salad which included 1.  Slightly chopped garbanzo beans with chopped green pepper &amp; no seasoning  2.  Spinach with way too much oil &amp; salt 3. bacon potato salad.  The entire plate may have cost them $5, and I paid $12.
  
Service:  After the cheese platter was finished our server &amp; bus boy looked at us 5x without clearing plates or filling waters.  We finally caught the server to remove our plates &amp; put in an order for the meal.

The only issue I had with this place was that it seemed a bit overpriced. The cheese/meat plate wasn&#39;t worth the $15+ we paid (it was good but not amazing). And I didn&#39;t understand why they charged so much for a corking fee if you were buying THEIR wine. I can understand if you bring your own in but if you are buying a bottle from them?

I went this past weekend for lunch with a friend.  The service was absolutely atrocious and the food was average.  The waitress took our drink order (I tried the &#34;surprise white&#34; and my friend asked for the &#34;surprise red&#34;) - figured we&#39;d see what sort of interesting glass they came up with for each.  She came out and set down two glasses of white on our table and walked away.  So aside from the fact that she got the order wrong, she didn&#39;t even tell us what types of wines we were about to drink.  We had to chase her down to bring my friend&#39;s red.  I then asked, &#34;What kind of white is this?&#34;  &#34;It&#39;s a sauvignon blanc,&#34; she replied.  &#34;Could you tell me what vineyard?  Anything about the wine?&#34; I pressed.  &#34;It&#39;s the Cono Sur.&#34;   This happened to be already on the wines-by-the-glass menu and coincidentally the same price as the &#34;surprise wine&#34; but ok, fine.  When she came out with the red, she also set it down and walked away.  My friend asked what it was and the response, &#34;It&#39;s a zinfandel.&#34;  &#34;What kind of zinfandel?&#34;  &#34;It&#39;s a zinfandel.&#34;  For reals?  This is a WINE BAR and you can&#39;t even tell us what type of wine we&#39;re drinking?  I get that this is the suburbs and all, but am I that spoiled by city wine bars that I expect a modicum of actual knowledge about the wine?

That ridiculous exchange aside, the meal continued to get weirder.  We were sitting at a two-top in the patio area.  Two people with their dog and baby show up.  The waitress comes over and asks us if we will move.  &#34;Why?&#34;  &#34;Because they want to sit.&#34;  (points to family).  I&#39;m just not understanding.  Why would you ask a table that has already received appetizers and drinks to move, particularly when there is another table available?  I thought maybe it was because the dog needed to be on the outside area of the patio, and being the dog-friendly lady that I am, was about to move, but the family ended up sitting at the open table instead.  I am still confused about why we were asked to move because the waitress never really explained it.

The asparagus, jamon serrano and bleu cheese appetizer was decent but not great.  The wild mushroom grilled cheese panini had far too much mustard and far too little gruyere.  When I order a grilled cheese, I want it oozing with cheese, not one slice of cheese slobbered in mustard.  The prosciutto panini was the best of the meal but still nothing better than you&#39;d find at say, Cafe Baci or similar counter-service places.

Overall so disappointed.  I feel so guilty writing bad reviews about a local business and I was hoping to make this a regular stop on my restaurant rotation, but I just can&#39;t get over the &#34;What kind of zinfandel?&#34;  &#34;It&#39;s a zinfandel.&#34; attitude."

Came here before going to dinner elsewhere for a beer and some cheese. They totally had Gumball head on tap which is amazing but alas, they ran out. It&#39;s not your fault, Cellar Door--that stuff is hard to come by. Anyway, the bartender suggested some beer that was similar to it. We ordered a 3 for $12 cheese flight with sharp cheddar, parmiganio something, and iberico cheese. Delish! They bring you the cheese on a wooden board, along with a few slices of bread and some ridiculously good sesame seed crackers on which to eat the cheese with. The atmosphere is calm and relaxing and inviting. One of the walls is lined with bottles of wine that you can purchase. I would not consider myself a classy girl but I didn&#39;t feel out of place here. I like cheese. I like beer. The Cellar Door does both.

All sharing the same small long room the wine shop comprises of a whole wall of bottles segmented off by type.  The brightly lit and wooden wall is in opposition to the rather stark bar side as if an afterthought or new idea.  

Come as a wine person looking for a quick fix.  As for me, this wino is going to find a different cellar.

If you&#39;re looking for sweet white wine and a pat on the head from the place which gives you unlimited bread sticks - try someplace else.

That brings me to the part I call: &#34;You don&#39;t want to know where sausage come from&#34;:

Here hot food consists of whatever can go onto a paninii grill - understandable as the method of having a bar and not a full fledged restaurant due to expensive license.  However these are foods that are easy to put together at home if you have a whole foods nearby.

To add to this was that the cold food plates (pate, cheese, etc) were taken straight out of the refrigerator unit which was in plain sight of the customers and &#39;tossed&#39; onto a non-descript plate.  I understand they are understaffed but it could be less obvious.

Granted they have a small space - but the use of the &#39;VIP&#39; like back room for grilling and preparation could make a difference.

My review for a wine bar might be a little biased on account that this is my first time in one.  Prices were pretty good for beer and they had a few cooler doors stocked of craft beer.  I guess the service was good, but there was something about the ambiance, which had a slight aire of snobbiness, that made me feel a little uncomfortable, as weird as that sounds.  Then again, maybe all wine bars are like that.  Just don&#39;t expect a down-to-earth vibe that you might get from some bars."

I find the ingredients to be pretty fresh and tasty, and had no problem with the salad or fruit. It&#39;s prepared fresh every morning from what Alice said. I believe it, because there was different fruit and salad stuff every time I went.

The service isn&#39;t very quick, but I didn&#39;t mind. Maybe 5-10 min to get the sandwich made from scratch, freshly sliced meat and all. The whole place is basically run by Alice herself. I definitely reccommend it."

I guess that&#39;s one way not to get hung up on when you call - just have all your calls go to a voicemail you never check. Nice job Alice&#39;s Deli and Groupon for a frustrating and miserable experience.

The homemade specials typically aren&#39;t that great because they&#39;ve been sitting under a heat lamp for hours and they&#39;re also the most expensive. The salad bar is rarely stocked and doesn&#39;t have a lot of options. Although they do have spinach, which I appreciate.

The deli itself is very cold, but it does have a big screen tv. I also question the kitchen&#39;s cleanliness, but it may just be because the appliances look pretty old.

My co workers and I literally saw the same dead bug on her counter for a week (which shows she doesn&#39;t clean). The smells that used to come out of her place were HORRENDOUS....as she has no hood system so all of her nasty cooking smells would come right into our office from her &#34;kitchen&#34;. Only buy pre-packed food and check the expiration date. She does not use a restaurant food service (Sysco/gfs) she buys everything in bulk at SAMs or Costco, and sells them individually. (Which I believe is illegal). If she had more than 2 customers she would get flustered and start yelling and snapping at people, extremely rude! Her prices are all over the place and don&#39;t make sense, I&#39;m surprised she doesn&#39;t charge for napkins.

It&#39;s tucked away in an office building a ways back from the main road, so I had no idea it even existed before I was given the Groupon.  After this experience, I won&#39;t be going out of my way to go here again.

I questioned the cleanliness of the salad bar to begin with, and the salad I got tasted really funky.  The beans I put in it tasted really bad, so I pushed them aside after my first bite.  The lettuce seemed dirty or old or maybe it was sprayed with something that gave it a weird texture/flavor.  I don&#39;t even know.  In the end, I couldn&#39;t finish the salad.

As for the sandwiches, they were the kind of thing you would have in your lunch box during grade school and not be that excited about eating.  Actually, that might be too nice of a description.  My turkey meat tasted very odd, and it was on stale grocery store bread.  Couldn&#39;t even finish that either.

Furthermore, everything besides the meat, lettuce, tomato, mayo, and bread was &#34;extra&#34;.  So if you wanted one slice of cheese on your sandwich, it would add 60 cents.  60 cents for ONE slice of cheese?!  Stop!  I guess an extra 60 cents isn&#39;t a huge deal in the big picture, but I don&#39;t want to imagine how much the sandwich would end up costing if someone tried to add a bunch of extra stuff like you can at other sandwich places.

All in all, I&#39;m sticking to Jimmy John&#39;s, Potbelly, or even Subway where I know I&#39;ll get a far better tasting sandwich."

First, the interior of this place really reminds me of Chinatown and has a really fitting atmosphere for a Korean restaurant. There are many different decorations such as the fish tank and pictures of South Korea that really catch my eye when I dine in here. 

I always come here with my friend when we are craving some Korean food. Let me tell you that the food here is spectacular! The veggie steamed dumplings are so delicious and so is the spicy dumpling soup which has the perfect amount of spiciness.

The staff that work here are so sweet and very professional when taking care of you. Very welcoming and friendly!

I ordered stir fried squid and yukgaejung (spicy beef soup).  Stir fried squid was actually decent, but a bit overpriced ($20, which is usually the price of 1 person&#39;s portion of marinated bbq beef).  

The problem was with Yukgaejung (which they claimed on their menu as their specialty).  The first time they served us Yukgaejung, it tasted so blend and some mix of soap and beef broth. I flagged this to the owner, saying it tasted a bit weird, and he was really kind about getting us another soup, that was marginally better.  It barely had stuff that should be in normal Yukgaejung and still tasted like a weird beef broth with some plastic smell.  But I felt bad complaining about this again since clearly this was not a mistake but made according to their recipe.

They also charge for the hot barley tea (2.50) which is normally not the case in korean restaurants.  Anyway, these two things came out to be $42.84 plus tips... which is totally overpriced in my experience, compared to other korean restaurnats in the city (where you can get a ton of side dishes, hot tea, and bbq for the same price).

Visiting from Virginia, sister was a college student and desperately craving Korean. We didn&#39;t have time to make it out to Chicago so we stayed local. Owner came out, made small talk, and also mentioned that he did not use MSG while my mother was in the restroom. 

When the food came out, she remarked that it didn&#39;t taste like there was any MSG which she thought strange but in a good way. No MSG, approved by a Korean mother! 

Banchan is a wide selection and the food wasn&#39;t anything spectacular. Definitely not up to par with Korean food on either coast, but if you happen to be craving Korean it&#39;ll do just fine. For dinner, I assume the the price of banchan is passed onto the entrees explaining the higher prices.

I&#39;ve lived in the area for almost 10 years now and this was the first time I had honestly even bothered to look at this place. In fact, I  really didn&#39;t even know it was there.

We walked in and there were a few other people eating there. We were seated and got menus and almost walked out when we saw the prices. I&#39;m glad we didn&#39;t. Dishes all seemed to be in the $17+ range which I was not expecting. I had eaten tons of Korean food before and never thought I would ever be paying more than $10 or $12 for soondubu jjigae. We ended up splitting dumplings, bugolgi, and soondubu jjigae between the 4 of us. With all the banchan it ended up being more than enough food and we had some to take home. 

The food itself was decent, but I still couldn&#39;t shake the initial shock factor of the price. I have had better Korean food (but I&#39;ve also had A LOT worse) for a similar price (after the bill was split).

We had a group of 7 including two kiddies. They put together a couple of tables and sat us within minutes.

Since my sister and brother in law have been there before, they ordered for us. We had two orders of the beef bulgogi, the ribs, and some dumplings. Considering our large group at first the rest of us were worried it might not be enough food, but that was not the case at all!

Their portions are generous, the service was fast, and the owners were extremely nice. The food was delicious! One of the best Korean restaurants I&#39;ve been to in a long time.

For a meal that costs $15-17 each for a small stone soup bowl, I personally think it&#39;s over priced. I get that the side dishes are suppose to be fun and cool, but any decent Korean restaurant will give you those same exact dishes. From my perspective all of the sides would be about a $10 app at any other restaurant that wasn&#39;t Korean, but since Tofu village IS a Korean restaurant, the prices in the meals shouldn&#39;t be raised to much. 

The side dishes were good, nothing especially exciting, but pretty standard. The soup that I got was yummy too, it was very hot and a fresh egg was cracked on top. I think it was worth closer to $10-12, similar to other restaurants that I&#39;ve been too. It didn&#39;t blow me out of the water.

First, let&#39;s start with the fantastic food. All of the entrees we&#39;ve gotten have been excellent and huge portions. That&#39;s not to mention the salad that comes out first as well as the tasty veggie pancake, and the fresh watermelon for dessert. And the sides you get are the best variety and freshest tasting I&#39;ve ever seen at a Korean restaurant I&#39;ve been to. I have to try so hard not to fill up on all the sides!
The food alone is worth the visit, but the staff here really push the place into the excellent category. Each time we&#39;ve visited, the people working here have been hospitable and go above and beyond to make our experience great. I have to especially single out our last visit with our 8 month old daughter. I&#39;ve been nervous taking her out since her favorite activity right now is what I fondly call her &#34;horror movie scream&#34; that she starts doing to see how people will react. The staff at J Korean were so nice to us and took the time to keep saying hi to my daughter to make her smile, they gave her some toys to play with during the meal to accompany the toys we brought, and even gave her a doll to keep at the end of the meal. They really didn&#39;t have to do that, but it made her experience even better (and she played with the doll the whole way home and basically every day since). 
So to summarize: excellent food, superior service. Make sure to try this place out."

We got medium spicy and it was just right for us.  Zingy but not lip-numbing spicy.  The beef is salty and savory.  

A long with them, they brought out about 15 banchan dishes: kimchi, potato, bean sprouts, potato pancakes, fried tofu, etc... We enjoyed the large variety of banchans.  I know some think the banchan are &#34;free&#34;, but come on folks, nothing is free.  They&#39;d be out of business if it was really free.  Their cost are built into each of the entree prices.  So chow down on the banchan and ask for more if you want more.

The upside: 
The portions are very generous-- there are a HUGE number of side dishes, and the main courses are more than filling.  If you are eating alone  you may even want to request that they not give you ALL the side dishes, as it might be too much.  Also, the service is friendly and very attentive.  I gave an extra star for these pluses.

The downside: 
There is a lot of food, but it&#39;s so-so.  From the side dishes to the main courses, there is just a little something missing.  The tteokbokki for example, is just rice cake boiled in a mixture of kochujang and water (they could at the very least use a basic anchovy/kelp broth).  The kelp crackers were unnecessarily bitter (I have had sweet or salty, but never bitter), And so on.  Most needed a small fix or adjustment-- I can tell, and I&#39;m not even Korean.

In general, it might be better if they focused on doing a small number of banchan very well, rather than offering an overwhelming number of underwhelming dishes.  The problem becomes worse for them, as others have complained that these side dishes are not fresh-- this probably has to do with the logistics of having so many separate dishes at the ready.....

I certainly felt like I was getting my money&#39;s worth in terms of quantity, but perhaps not in terms of quality..."

I always get the delicious beef tofu soup, mildly spiced.  Hubby mixes it up and tried the squid tofu soup, medium spiced.  The soup came with a generous serving of squid that is served separately then thrown into the hot soup.  There was so much squid that we were able to take home a third of it.

Update: The price hike of doubling the price is unwarranted because the portion is the same as before. In fact, the latest visit I found the tofu to be a bit dry and old, not as fresh as before.

I could not believe I missed this place for 4 years since I moved to Naperville. I think one of my friends didn&#39;t like this place and I have never thought about giving it a try. Well, I saw Korean spicy tofu soup in the reviews and thought I must try it at least once. 

The best Seafood Tofu soup I have ever tried. Period. I liked the waiter asked me how spicy I wanted to be. I told him I wanted it to be &#34;real spicy&#34;. It was perfect. It came in a black stone bowl and still bubbling hot. Tofu was silky soft with enough flavor. The soup was scarlet red, spicy and tasty. It was a bit salty but tasted great with a bit rice. Hot and spicy which was exactly I wanted. 

My lunch was Bibimap. On top of white rice, we had shredded carrot, one Sunny Side up Egg, bean sprouts, spinach,  zucchini, pickled radish, Bulgogi meat, and a bit mushroom. I added lots hot pepper paste and mixed all together in a 10-inch metal bowl(the same size as the bowl I use to wash vegetables at home). Yum!

My hubby got his Bulgogi which was served in a hot plate. I like Korean BBQ but don&#39;t want to grill it myself at the table which could be smelly and messy. I was glad it was cooked ans served. He loved it. 

The small appetizer dishes are pretty good but not great. I liked they provide the bean rice as well.

The service was great too. The waiter was not chatty but always showed up at the right time with the right stuff. We are served the hot tea when we sat down. Then all small appetizer dishes showed up. When tofu soup was served, he brought two sets of bowls and spoons for us to share. I was just feel a bit hot with the soup, two glasses of iced water showed up. Really no complain there.

I will definitely come back before or after my H-Mart trip every week."

While pretty good quality Korean food, the service and price are lacking. After going recently, the prices have basically doubled since when I first started going. I wish I could say the quality did as well, but after the owner changed, the quality has been a bit lacking as well. In terms of service, I was a bit annoyed by the fact that I didn&#39;t receive rice with my soup. We had to remind the server. 

Overall, the food still tasted pretty good. The appetizer dishes provided were decent, but I do miss the porridge that used to come with it. The tea is still as good as ever. Make sure to get tea, not just water. Only thing was the server didn&#39;t come by to check if we needed refills :(

I ordered kimchee beef tofu soup. The flavor was good, as well as the quantity of tofu and beef. A bit too much kimchee. I had medium spiciness, which was still pretty spicy, for someone with average tolerance. My brother had omelet rice, which he thought was pretty good, aside from the quality of the onions. It might also have had to do with his dislike of onions to begin with. My mom ordered the bibimpap, which was pretty good. Only thing I didn&#39;t like was the blandness of each topping. I usually like the uniqueness of flavor of each section, but I didn&#39;t find this one to be very distinguishable.

I enjoyed the meal overall, aside from these few little things. I would go again, although probably not too close in the future haha. Don&#39;t think my wallet could handle that."

The food here is delicious. I ordered a seafood tofu soup, super spicy of course, and it was really great! The banchan had lots of variation to it. Since I was with my sister we also got refills on the banchan.

The prices are a bit much, but if you don&#39;t come here often and you come for the tofu soup and banchan, it&#39;s not that bad in the long run."

We finished a movie around 8:30PM on a Saturday night, but they still let us sit down even though the restaurant was pretty much empty and they close at 9. 
The banchan came within minutes, and tea and water were frequently refilled. 

The tofu came out piping hot (as opposed to what others had said), and the server also asked if any of the banchans needed refilling. I thought the food was quite authentic (compared to previous experiences in Koreatown in LA), and the price ($12/person) for a filling meal with boxes to go was great value. The only bad thing was that we were really rushing our meal because it got awkward as they were closing everything down...certainly not their fault. 

I love supporting small businesses, and it looked like they were doing everything right."

While they both have similar menu&#39;s they are different owners. The service here however was extremely friendly. We called to ask when they closed and they asked how far away we were and said they would wait for us. Really how nice is that. You just don&#39;t get service like that. I had the spicy beef tofu soup for dinner. Be careful here asking them to turn it up because they will. My soup was spicy. I mean really spicy and I like spicy food. They gave me a giant bowel with a generous portion of beef and tofu. They also gave us generous portions of Kimchi which my boyfriend really enjoyed. Over all great service and food.

I am always warmly greeted and have excellent service. The waiters and waitresses are always on top of things! While they have raised their price in recent years you still get a good amount of food, especially if you get the soup. Their side dishes tend to change every few months so its sad when a see a favorite of mine no longer in the arrangement but I do get to try new things at least.

The head chef, who used to cook in Chicago&#39;s Korea town, makes his own chili sauce, and I&#39;d have to say that it&#39;s the best tasting Korean chili sauce I&#39;ve had.  My favorite is their ojinguh bokkeum, though they list it on their menu as &#34;Stir Fried Squid.&#34; I give this a 5 stars.  Ojinguh Bokkeum is my favorite Korean dish, and I&#39;ve tried countless of variations from many restaurants. This by far is the best I&#39;ve had.  It is well worth the $18.99 price.  I also recommend their Kalbi over the Bulgogi because you get much more meat, however if you prefer more vegetables, get the Beef Bulgogi - both get a 4.5 star.  If hot soup is your thing, I recommend their beef tofu soup, though they all taste great (4 - 5 stars).  

Their complimentary appetizers (served before the entrees) are very generous and freshly prepared daily.  Every now and then, they will serve something seasonal or new.  Just the appetizers.  Be careful how much you order because the appetizers can be quite filling if you&#39;re not careful.  

Lastly, I got to know the owner, chef and staff.  They are all great people and have gone out of their way to make us feel at home."

Have you ever seen a hot girl (or guy) and as you got closer they just turned out to be a total disappointment?  That&#39;s the new Chodang Tofu Village.  It was once amazing, but once you get in there to try it again, it&#39;s just not the same.

The food... yes the panch&#39;an was plentiful and SOME of it was good.  As with some of the previous reviewers, the kimchi and the spiced raddish were probably the biggest disappointments.  Those are some very common dishes for any Korean restaurant.  They seemed to be drowned in the sauces, rather than fermented/picked in the sauce.  I ordered the soondubu (being tofu village and all)... again... like other reviewers... the egg did not fully cook; however, the soup did come out boiling.  My theory?  They brought it to a boil and brought it straight out rather than bringing the soup and bowl to the necessary temperature.  I also ordered the dish mild to spicy, but I felt absolutely no burn or spice in it.

The service, ownership and the venue... I&#39;ll start with the easy ones.  Service was good, quick (which may have been the downfall of the quickly cooled soup) and responsive.  I had no real wait and they were very attentive.  The venue is the same as it was so it can still seat probably close to 40 or so inside.  The ownership... like so many other reviewers I don&#39;t want to sound racist or biased... I guess I should preface this with the fact that I am Chinese.  The two women working the front are both Chinese, and held multiple conversations in Chinese (including some confusion about how best to service tables while I was in there).  If there was a Korean chef or any Korean staff, I didn&#39;t see them.  The kitchen staff consisted of a Hispanic man and a Chinese chef.  Sadly, I just don&#39;t think they&#39;ve had enough experience with Korean food to do it right.

Overall, just go next door to H-Mart or look for an actual Korean restaurant somewhere, at least until this place gets things figured out."

Usually this is a big red flag, but after the food arrived I didn&#39;t understand why there weren&#39;t more customers, because the food was great! There was a good spread of banchans, and the sundubu was perfect for a chilly &amp; misty day. The kimchee tasted a bit different from what I&#39;m used to at other places, but that was the only thing off for the night. Service was very friendly and accomodating."

The service was very friendly and attentitive.  

I ordered the Bibimbap while my GF had a spicy tofu soup dish.  The bibimbap was kind of a disappointment as the sauce was solid, but overall, it was nothing special.  It needed more bulgogi...lots more?  My gf spicy tofu soup was also just alright.  However, the tofu part of her dish was superb as it had just the right firmness and texture perfectly harmonizing w/ the korean flavors.

There was a nice variety of side dishes including french fries.  Unfortunately for the bibimbap eater, it was somewhat of a repeat."

So, we had business in the area (Super H Mart, if you must know) and I was like &#34;hey, let&#39;s try Tofu Village,&#34; which I had been suggesting we try for about a year or so, it had gotten to the point where I was mostly annoying my wife when I mentioned it as a suggestion.  (We had a stretch of too much asian food, I&#39;m told.)  So, she said yes.  And we got there and she thought we were doing takeout and I thought we were eating in.  We ended up eating in, and we were glad we did. 

So, not a huge menu selection (which can be a good thing, as overwhelming choice can be daunting), but it was nicely described and had pictures of what you were going to get.  So we put in our order, we had a vegetarian (possibly vegan?) mushroom bi bim bap for my wife, and I got the Jap Chae, party because we had a baby with us and I know he loves noodles.   Everyone liked their food, my wife felt the bi bim bap at Kuma&#39;s Asian Bistro may edge it out, but she really liked the flavors of the Jap Chae and is curious about a vegetarian version.  The baby liked more of the foods than I expected including a lot of the banchan, as it turns out, he may be more adventurous than many people, hopefully it stays that way.

So, servicewise where I think they did great was when the banchan came out they specifically were describing each dish to us and generally placing it with how safe they felt it was for the baby to have it.  Sometimes a bit too close to the baby for our liking, (he is a bit a grabby) but the intentions were there.  For whatever reason, most Korean places I&#39;ve been to, even if you&#39;re all &#34;What&#39;s this, it&#39;s tasty?&#34; they&#39;re like &#34;It&#39;s banchan...  a side dish.&#34;  So, for this reason, I think it&#39;s pretty good if you&#39;re kind of new to korean food.

The prices are noted in a lot of reviews and I did notice it and took brief pause, but I felt like with all the food I got, I had no real issue with it.  

We liked it a lot, and will go again."

I love good a Korean meal, that being said; I am very picky about what I order and how it comes out. I ordered myself the traditional beef bulgogi, usually restaurants make it and it comes out dry and the portion is usually never enough for me. At Tofu Village it could feed 2 people along with the rice and plentiful side dishes. Not only were there so many side dishes, but they were delicious! Then my mom ordered the tofu soup and that was delicious as well but wasn&#39;t really craving it that night. 
The only problem is that I have passed this restaurant my whole life living in Naperville and I always thought it was some crappy Chinese restaurant.  I was wrong... obviously. The price is also reasonable and affordable for what you get! The chef&#39;s/cooks came and explained the food items and was very friendly as well as the waitress.

I was first introduced to it when I went to live in South Korea. I lived there for almost three years and became very involved with the people, culture and subsequently food. I appreciate everything about Korean dishes; I loved them so much that when I got back to the U.S my first task was to find a good Korean restaurant. Frequently, I go shopping at the Asian market called H Mart (in Naperville) so I found Tofu Village that way. The first time I went in there I was so excited that I didn&#39;t even mind the prices, which were VERY high for what they serve. I was very disappointed. The first time my husband and I went there, our food was bland and that is difficult to do, especially with spicy Korean stews. I had the mushroom tofu stew and he had the Korean bean paste stew. Which, (like I said) were both bland and disappointing, not to mention expensive. Also, this restaurant likes to switch out ingredients that would normally be used in these stews to save money, like the mushrooms for instance. The side dishes were good and plenty and I appreciated that, I even commented about having them as a separate meal. The waitress told me they have the side dishes as a meal and that it costs 7 dollars per person for unlimited refills. This (and the fact that we love Korean food) is why even though my husband and I were really disappointed the first and second time we went, we gave this restaurant three chances to get their stuff together. We had a particularly annoying incident with the side dishes which we decided to order as a main meal the last/third time we were there. After paying 7 dollars (each) the waitress and chefs were visibly annoyed at us ordering the &#34;cheap&#34; option. They refilled the dishes once and were so outwardly annoyed and hesitant to refill them again (even though they are unlimited) that we just left. This place is a disappointment with the food and the staff. In Korea, the restaurants are fantastic and mostly cheap. This one takes advantage of the rarity of Korean food (even though most ingredients are NOT hard to come by) and overcharges for very mediocre food that (in my opinion) does not even resemble Korean."

As with typical Korean places, they start you off with some small plates of kimchee and other Korean pickles, as well as a hot bowl of rice soup (not sure how to describe it, but very typically Korean).  They also serve you rice tea, which is free.

I love their tofu soup, which you can get with beef, pork, seafood, or other options.  They also have vegetarian options, for those of you who are not an omnivore like me.  The tofu soup arrived to the table quickly, bubbling in the hot stone bowl.  They alos bring out eggs that you can crack into the delicious broth.

Portions are pretty large, and you get your choice of white rice, brown rice with milletseed, or rice with eight types of beans.  You can also choose the level of spiciness from white (not spicy), to mild, regular, and spicy.  It&#39;s actually not very spicy at all so don&#39;t be shy about what level you think you can handle.

Korean food generally isn&#39;t good for vegans and vegetarians, but when I went to Chodang Tofu Village, I hadn&#39;t yet learned that lesson.

I did get some kind of tofu bowl soup but was not terribly impressed with it. Also, there was a significant language barrier, and I&#39;m not sure that my server understood the concept of giving me a dish without any animals or animal byproducts. Lord knows what I ended up eating.

I give Chodang two stars because I like the unusual concept and the fact that they have the guts to open a place like this in the replicon suburbs."

Tofu Village&#39;s menu is not large; the specialty is their tofu stews, which comes in a steaming iron pot of meat, veggies, and other good stuff. You know you probably should order it. However, they offer a lot of choices to the tofu stew, from beef to chicken to seafood to mushroom to miso. Everything has tofu in it. You can also alter the level of heat, although I have tried the spiciest and it isn&#39;t that bad if you are used to eating spicy food. Your choice of rice, white, brown or multigrain.

The tofu is always silky smooth. You also get a raw egg to crack into your stew. I know this grosses people out, but I love it. It adds a little creaminess to the stew. I have eaten it a dozen times and not gotten sick. The combination of rice and stew is great. I leave full but not full of self-hatred like I do after eating at Taco Bell or something. This is definitely comfort food without the guilt and also good for the winter months

I like that they offer banchan - little side dishes - alongside the meal. You can always ask for more of a certain dish without feeling bad. And that&#39;s free. 

Chopsticks are for the banchan while the spoon is for the stew and rice. Just put a little rice on your spoon and a little stew and eat it. I don&#39;t think it really makes good leftovers, but you can take it home with you if you don&#39;t finish it.

Sometimes the owner&#39;s kid is around, which adds to the homey feel. Once it walked up to my sister and offered her a Koala Yummy. Cute.

Overall, for ten bucks it&#39;s a nice lunch. Not cheap enough for eating everyday, but then again, why are you eating out for lunch everyday? For something healthy AND hearty, Tofu Village is a great choice. Just make sure to mix the egg in your stew!"

As a result, the Bi Bim Bop I had there quite good, and so were the side dishes. Only thing critical I can say is the bean sprouts was slightly off.

However, service there is extremely friendly and attentive. The owners were helpful in describing the dishes and checked up very often to make sure everything was satisfactory. They were also quite social, creating a very welcoming atmosphere. I&#39;ll be going back again in the near future."
tofu-village-j-korean-restaurant-naperville,Xander S.,UrmiwFKoCqG88EZ0MI-BbQ,"San Jose, CA",0,1,0,328,177,wsi02S0sWK7EQEZ6t2V9fg,1.0,2011-01-09,"WARNING: Different ownership, different food. This is NOT a Korean restaturant.

Let me say this first, so one doesn&#39;t think I&#39;m a racist Asian: the new owners are very friendly; they&#39;re Chinese, as opposed to the originally Korean owners, and they&#39;ve made great attempts to learn a decent amount of Korean. Too bad that this cultural education it didn&#39;t extend into the preparation of Korean food. Whether it&#39;s a deliberate mashup of Chinese  and Korean, I&#39;m not sure; but let me tell you it&#39;s beyond disappointing: it&#39;s just bad. I was almost angry at how they&#39;re attempting to masquerade as a Korean restaurant, and I pity any person who comes here expecting Korean food.

My family used to frequent this place in years past as it was one of the few Korean restaurants around Naperville. The previous owners were friendly, the food authentic, and was always satisfying. So you can imagine what  disappointment I had when I brought by girlfriend here with the expectation of eating yummy Korean food. It&#39;s really not.

I ordered extra spicy soon dubu soup, which is always my goto meal at Korean restaurants. If you get the right ingredients, it should be impossibly hard to screw up...

The first moment I noticed something was wasn&#39;t right was with the banchan; they were curiously not-banchan like, and each tasted somewhat sour and distinctly of too much oil or soy sauce. The kimchi was bad (a red flag for any Korean place) like they&#39;d been washed in water and dressed again in some odd non-Korean spice before serving. It tasted more like washed cabbage with chili sauce. After this, I became apprehensive about the main course; unfortunately, my fears were confirmed when I received a yellowish brown soup. Let me go into the details of what *not* to do with soon dubu:

Despite being served in a stone bowl, the soup was lukewarm. Soon dubu is supposed to be bubby hot, so you can put the egg in after serving. It wasn&#39;t, and like all the other views suggest, the egg ended up staying in a half-raw state.

Also, I don&#39;t know if the owners have ever been to a Korean restaurant, but soon dubu is *not* a teriyaki dish. It&#39;s not supposed to be sweet and sour. But that&#39;s what they served. The beef was tough and chewy, and tasted distinctly of teriyaki; and there were splotches of brown. Also, the broth itself was sour. Finally, the tofu was hard, and looked like it had been dumped in at the last minute. Not &#34;soon dubu&#34; (soft tofu) at all.

The owners must have noticed that I clearly wasn&#39;t going to finish my food, so they offered to pack it up. Maybe I should have said no, so that the message was more clear, but I already felt bad for them; for they clearly did not know what they were doing. I paid for the food, and walked out, still hungry, but having lost my appetite.

Lesson learned: I love Chinese food cooked the right way, but Korean food is not meant to be cooked in this odd Chinese style. Based on other reviews, it seems the name is changing to Wei&#39;s Kitchen, but still making &#34;Korean&#34; food.

Well, at least expectations can be more clear to passerby. Hopefully, these folks will learn too."

NoooooOOOOOOoooooOOOOOOoooooOOOO!!!!!!!

On the plus side, you get alot more side dishes. And they&#39;re good too!

But the star of the restaurant, the soondubu, is not what it used to be. Or supposed to be. The broth tasted off, did not come out bubbly hot, and I think they pre-cooked poached eggs and put it in for you. Huh?

The tofu...oh the lovely soft and silky tofu of yesterday. Gone. Replaced by some firmer version. 

And was it me or did the tofu taste slightly tangy? I didn&#39;t want to appear difficult in front of the people who I was with but on the inside, I was praying a little Chodang prayer...oh God please don&#39;t let me get sick from bad tofu (I didn&#39;t btw).

The employees here are so friendly and energetic, they are really pleasant to be around and it makes me happy to visit. As a bonus, it also has longer hours and a roomier seating area. I find that if I go to the Zoup in Warrenville 6:30 pm or later, well usually the soup we want is sold out already (usually the case) or is almost out and kinda not so great looking. There&#39;s a little more flexibility for picking up dinner here. 

12 soup choices are available daily and rotate. I find there are only 1 or 2 soup flavors in a single day that I usually really like or I&#39;m in the mood for. There can never be enough rustic vegetable bean soup in my life. But if no soup is really standing out or I want some more variety, I&#39;ve tried many salads that I like too. Asian salad is probably my favorite. They also have a nice 3-cheese grilled cheese on crusty bread. They more recently added pesto and tomato to it, but I usually custom order it the old way. 

They don&#39;t tend to change the salad/sandwich side of things too much, but sometimes have seasonal offerings, like last summer they had a mozzarella and berry salad, as well as a caprese sandwich, both of which were really good. 

There is also some flexibility with customizing sandwiches and salads. It&#39;s nice that they have nutrition info online, though it doesn&#39;t have the option to customize. 

Price can run on the higher side for what it is. But with salads and soups, sometimes I buy a larger size and split it into 2 or more meals."

I&#39;d say that I have tried 20 of their soups, and loved 10, liked 5, and wasn&#39;t a fan of the rest.  But I love trying new flavors, and understand not all trials are going to end with happy taste buds.  
Two of my favorites are the Rattlesnake Stew and the Indian flavored vegetarian soup I can never pronounce, let alone spell.  The Pesto grilled cheese is also great!  I didn&#39;t like the spicy shrimp bisque.
For people looking to save a few bucks, go with the half and half.  That way you get to try a couple things (soup, salad, or sandwich) and get the drink included. 
I love the little loaves of multigrain bread, and the sourdough goes well with some of the creamy soups.
I agree with everyone complimenting the staff.  They really appreciate your business, and show it with their friendliness and willingness to serve.  My niece loves tasting the samples, and I have never had an employee be anything but kind and patient.

On the positive end they have many soup choices, sampled a few and their quality is great. Have some interesting choices for sandwiches but not many. What kills it for me is they subscribed to the same business practice that Portillo&#39;s and Panera use. Price goes up and portion size goes way down but quality level is still high.  And worse yet, all their stuff tastes way better than Panera( not that Panera is bad) but prices are even higher and portions are even smaller than Panera. So no I wouldnt recommend."

Food taste ... 3-stars.
Price ... 2-stars.

Tried Zoup today for the first time. I wasn&#39;t really impressed. On a positive note... the staff is friendly and cheerful, they offer twelve different soups daily, and the dining room was relatively clean. On a negative note... the sandwich wasn&#39;t good, and the meal was expensive.

I ordered the HALF size Southwest Turkey sandwich with SMALL bowl of Fajita soup and SMALL fountain drink... and OMG it totaled $15.00 !!! Definitely more expensive than a similar half-sandwich-and-soup lunch at Panera Bread. 

One word to describe the Southwest Turkey sandwich is &#34;failure.&#34; The baguette is topped with a generous portion of chipotle mayo, a meager three slices of turkey, tomatoes, and pepperjack cheese--all of which is heated causing a gooey slimy drippy mess. As soon as you take one bite of the sandwich, the turkey shoots out one direction, while the baguette slips away in the complete opposite direction. Now you are left to re-build the sandwich yourself--it&#39;s messy work and worthless because everything is going to shoot out in every which direction as soon as you take the next bite. I tried re-arranging the contents again, but to no avail, so I gave up. I ate the hot tomatoes, followed by the turkey and cheese, and finished up with a mayo-glopped baguette. Overall, the sandwich was bland and didn&#39;t excite my taste buds.

The Fajita soup was fine. It tasted the way I expected it to... from a can or a plastic pouch with instructions to &#34;add water and stir.&#34; The soup comes with a choice of bread. I chose the sour-dough roll. Sad to say, but the sour-dough roll tasted much better than the sandwich.

If you are really picky and need 12 soups to choose from, then Zoup is for you. Personally, I am ok with Panera&#39;s choice of 2 or 3 soups. As far as sandwiches, Zoup&#39;s R&amp;D department needs to come up with something interesting that has depth of flavors. And the price... ugh... the meal was worth $10 but definitely not worth $15. 

At this time, I won&#39;t rule out eating at Zoup again... it is a good choice if you want to sit and relax while having a lengthy chat with friends. They have plenty of parking. And the restaurant is far less busy and chaotic than Panera Bread."

The spicy chicken enchilada soup was amazing. Wish I had gotten two sides of that one. But I decided to try the lobster bisque. It had a nice rich consistency. Great velvet mouth feel and lots of large piece of langoustine ( the more  economical version of lobster) but it had a lack in flavor need more lobster flavor but I tend to prefer the spicy soups anyway. Thanks Zoup for the great soup.

I&#39;ve driven by this Zoup! a million times and had yet to try it out. The first brisk fall day seemed fitting.

I originally was stopping in for a full bowl of soup in a bread bowl, but after perusing their menu full of salads, sandwiches and soup options, I decided to go with the half and half deal. I chose the southwest turkey sandwich (half) which is made up of sliced turkey, pepper jack, tomato, and chipotle mayo toasted on country french bread. To go alongside that I chose my favorite soup (in general) of all time: lobster bisque.

The sandwich was super tasty. Perfectly toasted and full of flavor. The chipotle mayo is a nice little touch. Nothing outrageously special about this sandwich, but definitely a satisfying lunch item. The lobster bisque I&#39;d have to say was just okay. Let&#39;s just say, I&#39;ve had better. It also could have been the fact that I got a southwestern sandwich with a seafood soup...weird combo, I  know - but they both sounded yummy!

If you&#39;ve never been to Zoup! it&#39;s worth a try. You won&#39;t leave unhappy, but you also won&#39;t be writing home about it.

Big variety of soups and samiches.  Being frugal with a sensitive digestive system at times,  I went with the pick 2 of chicken pot pie soup with half a chicken toscana samich.  I upgraded the size of the soup of ran extra $1 but in hindsight, maybe I should&#39;ve seen how big the original serving was before.   All told, lunch for cup of soup, half samich &amp; pop was $13.  Still pricey to me.  Soup was very good, right temp for me, but could&#39;ve used a bit more seasonings and some salt.  The samich was pretty good overall as well.   The bread, while soft, was  a little tough and my samich innards kept spilling out.  Minus points.   My friends had the gumbo and loved it.  For me, the place is a 3.5 stars out of 5:  I like it, but don&#39;t love it.  Can&#39;t say I&#39;m a huge fan but a fan.  It&#39;s clean, the service is very nice and friendly with good grub.

There was a long list of soups, and eager staff willing to give tastes before you made your selection.  Most soups were quite hearty; I would have preferred a typical chicken noodle, or something more broth based, but the lobster bisque and mushroom bisque I sampled were delish.  I ended up choosing one of their &#34;award-winning&#34; soups, the Chicken Pot Pie.  It was thick, but not too thick, and had big chunks of white meat chicken in it (and I&#39;m picky when it comes to meat in my soup!).  I could have done without the large amount of crumbled topping that came on top (something I didn&#39;t realize in sampling the soup), but next time I&#39;ll know to ask for it without.

They have different soups every day which you are allowed to sample. The chicken pot pie soup was delicious. I got the 4 cheese melt to accompany my soup for the pick 2 combo. I upgraded my soup since the side soup looked way too small for me. I added bacon to my sandwich and it totaled almost $11. If the sandwich was bigger, if I got more than 1 thin slice of bacon, and if the meal came with a drink , I wouldn&#39;t have minded paying $11. Unfortunately, I wasn&#39;t full after the meal. Next time, I will just get the soup which is what I enjoyed mostly."

The soup is of high quality and not a sodium bath like at most fast-food restaurants. The staff I encountered are helpful and friendly.

But the Zoup corporation needs to seriously re-think its pricing structure--it&#39;s just too expensive to eat here. If the prices were 20-25% cheaper (which is where they should be), this place would have a waiting out front."

Disappointed - the flavor of the selections I&#39;ve tried is just bland and artificial.  

I think I know why - when you order a salad or sandwich, most of the ingredients are CANNED or FROZEN.  Even the hard-boiled eggs are pre-fab, NOT FRESH.  The bread is also pre-fab, not baked fresh as even a Subway would do.  Portions are too small for the prices.  The claim that ahe soups are all &#34;hand-crafted&#34; doesn&#39;t ring true."

I sampled three soups before choosing the clam chowder which was suggested by the customer in front of me.  The soup was way too thick and the flavor was just average.  If you are looking for good soup and by that I mean that tastes like homemade, you will be disappointed.  I think $5.50 for a small soup is pricey considering the quality."

Service has been fast, accurate and anyone I&#39;ve interacted with has been so cheerful! We&#39;ve been there about 6 times since they opened and it&#39;s been perfect every time. Now for the food: delish. Let&#39;s get real here, it&#39;s fast food. It&#39;s not going to be healthy or good for you. It&#39;s going to be indulgent, fried and a total treat. The first thing I got when I saw they were back in town was my fave, the original Checker burger. Exactly as I remembered and I loved it! I&#39;ve had the fish, spicy chicken and the bacon cheeseburger as well, all awesome. The fish especially is nice and crunchy while staying tender in the center. Now for the fries. God have mercy on my waistline because these fries are the BEST. Seasoned perfectly, and sometimes if you&#39;re lucky you get an accidental essence of funnel cake (on their menu) and it&#39;s the perfect batch of fries. It&#39;s what carnival fries taste like. And the apple pies...OMG. Remember when McD&#39;s had that awesome fried apple pie? And then they switched to that powdery baked crap? I never forgave them for that. I don&#39;t eat apple pie to be healthy. It&#39;s supposed to be a treat!! Well, Checkers still fries it and it ROCKS. The only thing I don&#39;t like is how doused in cinnamon-sugar it is when they toss it in that at the end. It&#39;s too gritty so I just ask them to omit it (or just really light) and it&#39;s perfectly scrumptious without the gritty sugary coating. We haven&#39;t been to Wendy&#39;s, McD&#39;s or BK since Checkers came back. No desire to. Welcome home, Checkers. Good to have you back."

I&#39;ve had their fish tacos &amp; shrimp tacos for lunch, both are excellent. My husband had the Chilean seabass fish entree with sweet potato &amp; mango salsa the last time we went there for lunch. Of course I had to try it- delish. You can watch them cook your food too, which is kinda fun. I am a iced tea kinda girl so I feel the need to say their&#39;s is just ok.

Everything was delicious. Started with the crab cakes and they tasted so fresh! And meaty. My husband had the oysters and enjoyed those.

Red seafood chowder was so good my mother in law purchased a container to go! Very flavorful and good amounts of seafood- no fillers here!

I ordered the mahi mahi and it was amazing. The mango salsa makes it very light and refreshing. My family members also enjoyed their choices of fish and were glad we found this place.

It&#39;s a small little seafood shop with a restaurant for lunch and dinner.  Reservations are a must on the weekends.  I tried once before to get a reservation for a Saturday, but they were full.  It&#39;s a family run business and the service was a little slow, but that didn&#39;t really bother us.  We were there to have a leisurely dinner. While we were eating the owner/chef came to our table and introduced himself and make sure everything was okay.  He stopped by again during the meal and at the end of our meal to thank us.

I started with crab cake.  It was one of the best I have had outside of the east coast.  I had the seafood chowder which came with the meal and it was also excellent.  It seems to be a soup of the day with whatever seafood is good that day.  For my entree, I tried the gnocchi with shellfish.  Although the shellfish part of the dish was excellent, the pasta fell a little short.  It was a little mushy.  Probably best to stick with what they do best, which is the fish.  My husband got the sea bass and loved it.

They have the best wine and beer in the area, as it is BYOB.  

We will definitely be back and I will get something more traditional off the fish menu. I would love to give 5 stars, but the gnocchi held me back."

This place is small.  Only open three nights 5-8 for dinner, and reservations are pretty much a must.  
They are open for lunch, yet to experience.  The family runs it, no fancy dress, but clean, so very kind.  The chef said the fish is delivered two to three days out of the water.  Worth paying for.  We love fresh fish.  Yes, it&#39;s pricey, but hello, no ocean near here.....,simply prepared by chef in an open kitchen - yes open kitchen.  Flavored awesome, veggies delish!!!

Very clean, simple dishes, expertly handled, were the quality of the fish is the star. We showed up 1/2 hr before their scheduled close without a reservation, and we were seated despite being mostly full with some rather large tables. We started with the oysters and tuna tower, which were both tasty, attractively presented and handled well. Than we had the skate fish and grouper. Both were amazing and we enjoyed the healthy simply prepared vegetables, which were seasoned well and delicious. Really impressed by the nice sear on the fish as well. 

A few tips: make a reservation. (This was our first time there, so we didn&#39;t realize it was customary, since most market style eateries don&#39;t really do reservations). This is a small establishment, clearly operated by a family (the kids are the hosts, bus the tables and your wait staff, while the adults prepare the food) so don&#39;t go in there expecting service like a super fine dining restaurant, with a sommelier and extensive experience from your servers, lol. It&#39;s a quaint, market eatery, not Alinea. (That being said, I thought the young staff was very professional, polite and courteous, despite obviously being a little overwhelmed by their 15+ people table, and others). 

Prices are fair for the quality of fish and expert prep (about $30 per entree, which includes their delicious red chowder or salad), blue point oysters were very reasonably priced (12 for $18). That being said, if you&#39;re the type of person that wants quantity rather than quality, or likes a bunch of bells and whistles on your plate, you will probably be disappointed. The plates are more like fine dining plates which are usually smaller and not the typical American gluttony portions. (I actually thought our servings were quite big compared to other &#34;fine&#34; restaurants I&#39;ve been to recently)."

Anyhow, this business is primarily a seafood market, not a restuarant.  The food is expensive, because premium seafood is pricey.  Always..especially since we live in the Midwest.  It&#39;s fresh and there&#39;s great variety.  
I love their lunch menu.  Tons of sandwiches, fish tacos and shrimp quesadillas among other fare.  They even have a sushi chef that works during the week (11-2?) and it&#39;s excellent!!  Last time I had spicy tuna, Mexican and a Philadelphia roll for lunch.  So fresh, made to order, fish was velvety and melted in my mouth.  Definitely a must try.  I haven&#39;t eaten dinner here due to the limited hours, but I hear it&#39;s byob and they seem to draw a decent crowd.  I will continue to support this business, there&#39;s nothing else like it in the area and they deliver consistently great lunches and fresh delicious seafood to prepare at home."

We started off with their daily soup, which was Red Seafood Chowder. It came loaded with seafood. They definitely did not skimp.

We also ordered a Seared Ahi Sandwich with Wasabi Mayo and a Crab Cake Sandwich with Garlic Mayo. Both were incredibly fresh and incredibly tasty. It gave us nice combo of savory and sweet(er).

The Seared Ahi was a little bit thinner than I am used to, but no complaints because of the taste. The Wasabi Mayo had the great wasabi taste, but not the kick, which is good or bad depending on who you ask.

The Crab Cake sandwich was my favorite. The crab cake itself was flavorful and had a good amount of crab in it. 

Overall, the food was great, the cost was reasonable ($30 including tip), the service was great, and the fish tacos we saw over at the table next to us will be our next meal at E&amp;S."

I took my wife here for our 22nd wedding anniversary.
I thought it&#39;d be a nice evening for us both after a long day of spending time together and taking care of some errands.

I called to ask if reservations is necessary since it&#39;s Friday evening in St. Charles. I was glad to hear we&#39;re going to have a table at 8p.

My wife and I arrive in St. Charles and it took as a while to find the place.  E &amp; S Seafood is located in a strip mall area.  It&#39;s not visible if you&#39;re coming North on Rt 31.

My wife and I went around and eventually found it.

Parking area was not full. 

Looking at the restaurant, it looked nice.  Only two tables were occupied.

By the time we got to the door and opened it, the couple from the other table were leaving.

We entered the restaurant and was greeted by, I&#39;m not sure what his role is in the restaurant, a young man.
He showed us a table that was in an odd location.
I immediately noticed a hand sanitizer dispenser behind where my wife would sit.
I didn&#39;t even sit down. I immediately asked if we can sit somewhere else.  It is our wedding anniversary...  I&#39;d like to sit on a table for two.  I pointed to the table located close to the window and we&#39;re moved, no problem.

We sat and we&#39;re approached by another young man.  He gave us a menu with very limited items to choose from.

I asked him what sort of thing can they do with the fish I&#39;m interested in ordering. He was not very knowledgeable.

I asked him what fish he&#39;d recommend for the evening.  He just said &#34;Tuna&#34;.
He didn&#39;t go through what&#39;s available for the evening, how it can be prepared, what comes with the dish, etc...  I was stunned.
He explained a little what we can do but explained it poorly.
My wife and I were left to figure things out.

For starters, I ordered 1/2 dozen raw oysters.
The oysters arrived on a bed of ice with a bit of horseradish and cocktail sauce in small sauce servings.
Oysters were delicious.

Next, we ordered the Scallop dish and the Chilean Sea Bass.
My wife liked her Scallop dish. I liked my Chilean Sea Bass dish.
I asked for rice with my fish. I received mashed potatoes for my side dish along with asparagus and veggies.  I didn&#39;t ask to correct it.

So, we received a few slices of bread with more than regular butter + a serving of side salad with ranch and a small bowl of Seafood Chowder + our entrees + no dessert + just water...  How much do you think was our bill for the night?..  Almost $90 with tip!..

Food tasted good...  Maybe even very good...  But the experience, the service...  For the price I paid, it&#39;s high...

Will I come back?  I will...  If the owner&#39;s buying...

I can&#39;t recommend the place to my friends or family because it&#39;s pricey.  I&#39;ll tell whoever ask me about the place...  &#34;I liked the food but it&#39;s too much money for what you&#39;d get.&#34;

I&#39;m sorry but they&#39;re going to need help if they want to stick around."

The menu changes weekly and, as other have mentioned, you can also request anything from the fresh seafood case to be custom prepared.  So it was with my Grouper and mango salsa over steamed vegetables.  Scallops, Walleye, Salmon, everything our table ordered was perfectly cooked and plated.

Lucky for me, Ernesto still had several of those cantalopey Pacific coast oysters on hand that were the perfect opener for the rest of our meal.  Even luckier, no one else at our table likes oysters, so they were ALL mine!  The smoked salmon appetizer was also great.

Salads were very good, nice dressings.

Entres were truly amazing. Perfectly cooked and flavored, lightly breaded, with a nice dollop of sauce to complement the seafood. We had walleye and halibut.

Sides were nicely done also. The asparagus was cooked to exactly the al dente crispness required.

Service was very good also.

The menu is extremely limited (2 apps and 3 entrees to choose from) but the options were very tasty (ceviche and lobster was amazing, red snapper just okay).  Some items (like oysters) aren&#39;t on the menu but if they have them in house, they&#39;ll prepare anything you like so check the chalk boards!!! Also, Diamond is BYOB and doesn&#39;t charge a corkage fee!

The atmosphere is just okay.  It feels like you&#39;re having dinner in your Aunt&#39;s kitchen as it seems the entire family (kids included!) is helping to serve everything from bread to water to entrees.  That part is great but one child was dressed in his (hopefully not post-game) soccer uniform and another server was wearing flip flops!

The reception I got was very cold...something like, What are you doing here?  I asked if I could order some food.  No! It seems that Friday night is by reservation only.  I guess the empty tables I saw were reserved for diners who had not yet arrived.  I couldn&#39;t order to carry out, nor could I see the dinner menu.  I was welcome to take a lunch carry out menu if I liked, and I didn&#39;t like.  I can understand that it is a small place and that they may cater to an elite crowd, but gosh, I was wearing my best shoes, and had my hair combed an everything.  I could have been let down more politely, I could have been encouraged to gather some friends and make a reservation for some subsequent Friday, I coiuld even have been teased by showing me what was on the menu for the evening, but no, none of that was allowed.

It had been so depressing to come back to the midwest and be stuck with paying for average &#34;restaurant-chain&#34; seafood. That is of course until we heard about E&amp;S Fish Market (formerly known as Diamond Seafood).
We have been there for lunch several Saturdays this year already. It feels as if this is our private little &#34;fisherman&#39;s warf&#34; in our backyard. We have not been to a dinner service yet, because we have been that happy with the lunch selections, price, quality, and unpretentious feel of experience. We always have a habit of purchasing a fresh selection for us to prepare at home later in the evening. We do plan to find a sitter for the little guy so that we can come by for one of Ernesto&#39;s dinner services, because his FB posts look so amazing!!!!!!
I have had the blackened grouper sandwich, salmon burger (I hate salmon but this is actually quite wonderful), halibut, crab cake, and the fish taco which were all out of this world (or at least way out of the midwest). This weekend I know that I am going to get the scallops for lunch because I saw them being prepared for another customer last week and I was jealous. 
I would love to see E&amp;S on the TV show - Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives.... but not because it falls into any of those categories. E&amp;S belongs there because of the quality, precision, and their love of the food they prepare. This place place is a true gem!!!!!!"

I&#39;ve seen their menu and what they have to offer and it sounds good but usually I&#39;ve purchased fish from here because recipes have been inspired to be attempted and usually a good fillet would work best. The people are really nice and it&#39;s a small restaurant. St. Charles really needed a seafood restaurant because Red Lobster doesn&#39;t count and we need another sushi place like a hole in the head.

My wife and I met some friends for dinner on Friday night.  Our friends have raved about Diamond&#39;s for a while now.  They say they have the best fish tacos around.  I&#39;ll have to try them next time I&#39;m looking for some good grub for lunch.  

But anyway, going in we had no idea what to expect.  Diamond&#39;s is located in an unassuming strip mall near downtown St. Charles.  It&#39;s a cash and carry fish market by day serving up quick service lunch.  But on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights Diamond&#39;s opens their doors for dinner.  There are literally 6 tables in the place with one table dedicated to a party of 6-8.  The rest of 2 and 4 tops.  So if you plan on going you MUST make a reservation.  

They don&#39;t serve alcohol so come prepared with your favorite bottle of wine or six pack of beer.  They don&#39;t charge a corkage fee either.  This is a humble operation that is truly a family owned business.  I really thought it was extra special when our water was served by the sweetest little girl after we were seated.  She couldn&#39;t have been older than 10 tops.  

As for the menu...it usually changes all the time.  There&#39;s a limited number of entrees to choose from but enough to make even the pickiest of eaters happy.  The food consists mostly of fish and other seafood delights (i.e. shrimp, crab, lobster, etc..).  I ordered the potato encrusted Striped Bass.  It was cooked to perfection and served with a light sauce that didn&#39;t over power the freshness of the fish.  In fact, everyone&#39;s entree was prepared with care and attention to detail.  It&#39;s hard to believe they can pull this off with such a limited staff but they do.  I must warn you though.  Don&#39;t expect to be able to get in and out of this place in under an hour.  It&#39;ll be tough.  Just sit back and relax with your friends, family, loved one, whatever.  Most of all enjoy the simplicity of Diamond&#39;s Seafood.  Appreciate the uncomplicated menu and effort and true pride the owners take in preparing each and every plate with care.  

I got the sense this is a place where locals tend to gravitate to.  I&#39;d say it&#39;s a unknown secret in the Fox Valley except for the fact that all the tables were full the entire time we were there.  Like I said...make reservations.  

I should mention that despite the location (i.e. strip mall) and the fact that Diamond&#39;s is basically a takeout seafood market by day they really do a good job converting the dining area at night.  White table cloths, flowers and candles, and decent lighting.  

If you love fresh seafood and fish and like a place where you can bring your own bottle of wine/beer then you really need to get to Diamond&#39;s Seafood in St. Charles.  You won&#39;t be disappointed.  In fact you&#39;ll be coming back again.  I know I will!!"

Simple and good portions.  Though the food was ok, smaller portions, this time I was shocked to see that  there were children sitting on the counter where the food was prepared.  When I took a closer look around I was turned off by the lack of cleanliness.  After talking to who I think is the owner I discover that it is under different ownership.  I will not be back.  It is not Diamond Seafood anymore.  The previous owners moved to Lake Zurich which is a bit of a trek but I think I may try to make it out there for lunch.  I called them and they have a menu of take and bake dinners that sound amazing. Their number is 847-438-4900"

I have been coming here for the last few months, mostly on Thursdays when they have their $6 burger special and $2 bottled domestics.

The reason I am rating 3 stars is for two reasons:

1. When you get a burger, for some reason you cannot take anything off. What I mean by this is that you cannot order it with &#34;no lettuce&#34; or &#34;no tomatoes&#34;. They do zero substitutions, so if you&#39;re like me and just want it plain, you are basically throwing away a small side salad. My biggest concern with this is that if someone is allergic to any of these items, they are pretty much screwed.

2. The service. It seems to be a constant hit or miss when it comes to the kind of service you receive here; there is almost never any consistency. One day you can have a waitress that is very attentive and helpful, and the next you can have one that never checks on the table (refills for example) and gives you attitude when you ask for something and proceeds to ask the entire table if they need anything else before she walks over there because it would be such a bother for her to walk another 20 feet. I simply don&#39;t understand it.

Overall anthony&#39;s is great for a quick burger, but that&#39;s about it. I wouldn&#39;t recommend big groups coming here either, the owner likes to watch them like a hawk for no reason."

The event was fantastic, one of the best I&#39;d been to! Loads of food, several drinks per person, and the service was amazing! 

Unfortunately, everything went downhill from there. We were so impressed, that we visited again (literally five days later) to watch a Bears game. While the food was pretty good, we had an appetizer that was literally forgotten, and a drink, as well. We ended up receiving it, but it took quite a while. For the record - the mac and cheese bites are super delicious.

The bar area (in the back) is an amazing place for parties - specifically in the summer. The bar is round and in the middle of the room, and there are garage doors that open to a patio. When I was here for the Yelp event, I already had my summer event in mind, and decided to connect with the owner on details. I&#39;m not sure if I was speaking with the owner or a manager (as his name wasn&#39;t Anthony), but it was quite the debacle to get a hold of this person. I followed-up over email at least three times, and it took several missed phone calls and voicemails to finally connect. Until I sent an email and said we&#39;d look elsewhere, I didn&#39;t receive much of a response.

So finally, a month after trying to connect, I spoke with the contact, and though he seemed very helpful, I was floored by the prices. The prices I was provided with were on par with hosting a shower at a nice Italian restaurant (and I know this, because I was planning one of those, as well) - and this of course, was for fried finger food, and a buffet no less - not some plated meal. On top of that, it was required that I put down a deposit and commitment in January for a July event. 

We spoke in December, and he said he&#39;d follow-up with me in January. It&#39;s the last day of March, and I still haven&#39;t received a call. That&#39;s just fine - I&#39;ve already booked a much better venue - but I couldn&#39;t believe the high prices and lack of follow-up. Perhaps Anthony&#39;s is swimming in business and didn&#39;t need mine. The food is good, but not enough for me to come back."

Based on the reviews from Yelp we decided to pick here to eat. My boyfriend and I split everything. We got the southwestern flat bread which I wasn&#39;t impressed with. I ate maybe 2 pieces he finished. We got cowboy burger and a chicken sandwich ( I forget the name) both of which. We&#39;re great! The fries were over seasoned but the sweet potato fries were great! The only downfall was the service. Our server was extremely slow and it took forever to take our check. Overall the food was pretty good however we were pretty hungry since we didn&#39;t eat since breakfast.

I had a few drinks at the bar before an elite event. The main bar is HUGE and gorgeous. I could definitely see myself getting my happy hour on here. Their beer menu is decent and their bar food, amazing. The wings and mac &amp; cheese bites are enough to make me want to come here every day! Too bad I don&#39;t live in the area. 

They have a covered patio and an open patio featuring garage doors which open to the another bar in the back. WHOA! Summer please come back sooner!!

If I ever find myself near the Joliet area, I would def stop by to grab lunch or dinner. I&#39;d love to try more of their delicious food. Actually, I wouldn&#39;t mind making the trip anytime."

I had their chicken wings, chicken tenders, meatballs, chopped salad, crab cakes, flatbread, and fried mac n cheese bites. Everything was very delicious and would love to come back to try out the fried calamari. My 2 favorites are the chopped salad and fried mac n cheese bites. I was not expecting the fried mac n cheese bites to be big portions, but I love mac n cheese esp fried. 

The atmosphere is really nice here. The indoor area was very spacious and has tv&#39;s everywhere to catch any game. The backroom was my favorite part because it was all windows. I believe in the summer time they open up the windows which would be cool to see. 

The service is very friendly and they know their menu very well. I was also informed by the bartender that they make their juices fresh that they put in their cocktails. Not too many bars go above and beyond like that. 

I would def. come back."

The restaurant is very spacious and this is a great place to catch any sporting event because there are plenty of TVs all throughout. I sat in the back area and I can imagine how nice it is in the summer because you have the option of sitting outside or inside the patio with the garage door Windows that go up. I loved the high ceiling with the skylight too. My boy friend and I were greeted immediately and we were told the specials. I was very happy with my cocktail choice and stuck to it the remainder of the night. I had a baileys, vodka drink that was deliciously strong. My boyfriend had beer, whiskey and a red ginger beer cocktail that he enjoyed very much. We tried the wings, flatbread, meatballs, Mac and cheese bites, crab cakes and the chopped salad. Everything was delicious! Nothing disappointed us and I was in love with the salad. Omg that salad was delicious!!! I will be back very soon to stuff my face again. Great atmosphere, good eats, strong drinks, lots of TVs.... My kind of place! Good job Anthony&#39;s. I will be making the drive from Carol Stream to hang out at your place."

I had the &#34;pleasure&#34; of frequenting Sammy&#39;s back in the day so I was FLOORED by the transformation that the new owners performed.  It is literally 100% different! (which is a good thing).  We were greeted by a pleasant hostess and she allowed us to sit wherever.  We took seats at a high top on the mall side of the bar.  The sun was pouring in and it actually made for very nice ambiance.  The bar is gorgeous and you can definitely tell they dropped some money in this place.  There are TV&#39;s everywhere and the new patio is unbelievable.  I am really looking forward to sipping a brew or two out there with the garage doors open this summer.  Hopefully the crowd they draw isn&#39;t terribly shady as it was when it was Sammy&#39;s.  

We ordered some wings for an appetizer (B). We tried two of the three sauces they offer, the buffalo and the spicy asian zinger (or something)  Both were good.  The only drawback was the sogginess.  I compare all wings to Metro&#39;s and these were just drenched.  I probably should have asked for sauce on the side and will from now on.

My wife ordered the grilled steak tacos (three good sized tacos). B. They were good but needed a bit more flavor.

I ordered the fried green tomato BLT.  B.  It is huge!  But also needed some flavor.  I can&#39;t quite put my finger on what it needed, but it was just not outstanding.

I am really excited about Anthony&#39;s.  The renovations, service and menu are above average and I think they should do well.  
I look forward to trying the many other menu items and definitely enjoying the patio in the warm weather!!

Joliet is lucky to have this fresh fab local restaurant &amp; pub. I&#39;d totes be a regular if I lived closer, but regardless, I&#39;ll be back.

For starters, the restaurant itself is stunning. Super cool layout with features like a center bar, tons of flat screen TVs, high-tops, low-tops, and an awesome semi-outdoor area with opening garage doors, more TVs, and it&#39;s own bar. Obsessed.

The hubs and I stopped in for lunch. There were a couple tables of people and one side of the bar completely occupied. We opted to sit at the bar and I&#39;m glad we did. The bartender was super nice and fun to talk to. We both ordered up a Bell&#39;s Winter Pale Ale (to cure our winter blues of course). The bartender served them up quick and with a frosted glass - that&#39;s what I&#39;m talkin about.

On to the good stuff. The food. Their menu is extensive and includes apps, salads, flat breads, burgers, sandwiches, soups, entrees, dessert - the works. There&#39;s a good variety but a lot of it centers around Mediterranean cuisine. 

The Greco flatbread looked intriguing so I ordered it and I&#39;m super glad I did! It was delicious. Perfect flatbread crust with gyro meat, tatziki sauce, feta and fire roasted tomatoes. Yummy! I ate it all but 2 pieces which my husband devoured.

He ordered a turkey burger and side salad which he really enjoyed. I of course nibbled on a bite of his burger and I had to agree. It was plump, juicy, and had a bomb ass pretzel bun. 

Anthony&#39;s is just getting started folks. So make your way there and check &#39;em out! Can&#39;t wait to see how they evolve and DEFINITELY can&#39;t wait to take advantage of their outdoor bar in the warmer months.

Side note: They have a chocolate tower cake that includes &#34;four gigantic layers of chocolate cake, iced and layered with a rich chocolate icing and finished with chocolate cookie crumbs&#34;. REALLY kicking myself for not getting that because it sounds like absolute heaven (damn new years resolutions!). Next time for sure..."

The outdoor bar area was my favorite spot, as it is open air, but with a roof and partial walls. Lots of huge TVs to watch the game.
The food was well made, good sized, and unique. Lots of the typical bar food items, but also some greek, asian, and Mexican. My favorite was the cobb salad, with lots of chicken, avocado, bacon and cheese. 
They have daily drink and food specials, lots of quality for a reasonable price.

I had lunch in the early afternoon on a Friday, and it was dead, so I had my doubts.  The restaurant is huge, there are three distinct sections:  the inside, the covered patio, and the open patio.  I sat in the covered patio area, which had two massive overhead garage doors open, which let the sun pour in.  It was unseasonably warm, but as the breeze rolled through, the bartender said it well, &#34;it feels like a resort in here!&#34;  Indeed it did!

There were 2-3 other people around the indoor patio area, all looking relaxed as if they were really at a seaside resort.  There&#39;s nothing else nautical about the place, it&#39;s definitely a sports bar - TVs everywhere.  I would recommend this place to anyone looking to watch a game.  There is a ton of seating, and it appeared there was no bad seat in the house.  As I ate, I didn&#39;t even know which TV to look at!

The beer menu isn&#39;t a novel, which was welcome.  These endless beer menus at places are starting to annoy me.  There were maybe 8-10 beers on draft, all typical and respectable brands including some local craft breweries, and less than 20 bottled varieties including seasonal ales.  I had an Illusive Traveler grapefruit ale, perfect for this summerlike day.

The food menu is extensive.  I&#39;d recommend checking it out online first.  I knew I wanted the Greco, a flatbread with gyro meat, tzatziki sauce, feta cheese, and tomatoes.  It was so good.  The flatbread had the texture of a pita, but still crispy to hold up to the juicy tomatoes and the sauce and cheese that was loaded on.  I was also tempted by the burgers and sandwiches, but this flatbread cannot be passed up!

My lunch was topped off by the soundtrack at Anthony&#39;s.  It was basically &#34;The Best of Angela P&#39;s childhood,&#34; which included A-Ha&#39;s &#34;Take On Me,&#34; and Phil Collins&#39; &#34;Sussudio,&#34; which played over and over in my head all weekend.

I think this place used to be one of those bars that are wannabe clubs frequented by guys who think they are cool because they drive tricked out Honda Civics and like tanning beds a lot.  I don&#39;t know, that&#39;s the vibe I got from the old place.  Not sure what kind of crowd hangs out at Anthony&#39;s at night, but it&#39;s a respectable place during the day with GREAT food."

Our friends got the philly sandwich &amp; fish tacos- both looked amazing. FYI- the fish on the tacos is grilled, not battered. That took our friend for a surprise, but he enjoyed it.

The only thing odd was that the owner was in the back bar drinking and talking with friends. You&#39;d think being the owner he&#39;d be running around making sure everything is running smoothly, and not drinking booze at the bar.

The restaurant is very appealing to the eye, very comfortable and the wait staff was very courteous and friendly. It was clean and very presentable. That&#39;s about where my appeal for Anthony&#39;s stops

I ordered crab cakes for an appetizer that were &#34; okay&#34; at best; nothing to write home about. My entrée was the Baja fish tacos. These tacos were supposed to be a signature item for this restaurant. However they tasted like dirt. I cannot explain how or where this taste was coming from. It tasted like very cheep catfish - catfish that was old and not farm raised. The corn tortilla shells literally fell apart while I was trying to eat them. The meal included three fish tacos however I was only able to eat one and a half. I couldn&#39;t bear to eat any more. 

My wife had a hamburger she enjoyed. It was cooked to perfection it was served on a pretzel roll along with some very large onion rings. Overall she was pleased with her meal.

Anthony&#39;s has a relatively good craft beer selection so I suppose it would be a nice place to stop for a cold beer on a hot summer day. But for dinner, I would find another restaurant."

Squares they were good then I had the Cubano sandwich and my wife the flatbread pizza. The sandwich was very good.  My wife said the pizza could have been cooked a little bit longer. Tonight was our second time there. We&#39;re sat at the bar again and we&#39;re going to order the Mac and cheese squares again to
Start with again and order more from there. We ordered beers and asked for a menu the bartender also gave us a special menu. After another couple sat next to us the bartender took our special menu to give to them. She checked back with them never returning to take our order. They ordered and got their food and the bartender still had not returned to ask is if we were ready to order. So after about 30 minutes of her walking past and never asking if wanted to order we left having a beer a piece we spent $5 here and went to Hooters for dinner. Where we received exceptional customer service. I liked the food  the time were able to order it. Maybe we&#39;ll give them a try again. Funny thing I think I recognized out bartender as a former Tilted Kilt employee and before coming here we had a few drinks and an appetizer at the Tilted Kilt at the Joliet mall and couldn&#39;t say enough good things about our bartender Candice who actually did what a bartender should do. Tend her bar I&#39;ll still go back maybe next time we&#39;ll have a better bartender who will make me want to come back again. If we have the same bartender as tonight we probably won&#39;t be back."

The first 3 tables we found were dirty and filthy. After finding a clean table we looked around for a waitress. 3 were visible but were standing way across the other side of the bar talking. I went to the front bar ( We were at the rear bar) and requested two drinks and a menu. The waitress said that there were waitresses in the rear bar. I said no one has come to our table and we have been waiting for 15 mins. Ordered food, burgers and fries. Burgers were below average kind of hard. Fries were oil soaked, beer was on draft and great. I have been here several times but this was the worse. This bar lacks over site of the staff. The staff run this place like a high school hang out. Too bad because this place is nicely set up."

It&#39;s a huge transformation from the previous Sammy&#39;s concept.  When you walk through the door, you will not recognize a thing.  Extra star for the effort here.  

We at in the dining room.  I like the menu.  I ate the salmon salad and really enjoyed it.  

It&#39;s a good place for large groups b/c it&#39;s large enough were you can have some privacy or belly up to the bar.  I guess it&#39;s upscale casual.  I&#39;m also glad that it&#39;s not a franchise.  Does the mall area need another franchise?"

We are supremo time wasters, I guess. 

Needless to say, wasting all of that time made us hungry ..... really, verging on HANGRY.  

I hit the Yelp search, and BOOM, this place popped up as &#34;Hot &amp; New.&#34;  Off we went, and as we pulled into the lot, we realized this place used to be Samy&#39;s!!  Ahhh, may a night of regret for fresh, young 20-somethings.  Good times were had by all!  Anyway, I wasn&#39;t expecting much, but when we walked in, it was transformed!  No stale beer smell, no cloud of last night&#39;s axe spray, and no sticky floor.  It looks like they rebuilt it!  Hell, maybe they did.

Sunday, they had $5 Bloodys (he got up on that) and I hit the $3 mimosa.  I had the chipotle chicken sandwich, which had just the right amount of heat, and he had the gyro.  He noted it was good, but not special.  Hell, we all know you get the best gyros from a greasy pit in a questionable area......like, say, Samy&#39;s.  BHABHHAHAB. 

Anyway, good food, worth a stop."

I would maybe come back for the bar but definitely not the food. I had the crab cakes appetizer. I made the mistake of not asking if the crab cakes were made in house. They were pre-made, frozen crab cakes. The tomato bisque was also pre-made. I found both to be terrible. My boyfriend had the mamma mamma pasta, it completely lacked flavor. The garlic bread didn&#39;t even taste like garlic or butter. I had the southwestern Flatbread. It was ok. But I wouldn&#39;t it order again. The prices were ridiculous for the quality of food that I received. The service was great though. I believe our server was Will. He was excellent."

We are always in the hunt for a good neighborhood family restaurant. This place just opened and we decided to give it a try. I am glad that we did, this place was great. It was clean, the silverware was so clean we could see our reflections. Granted this place only opened 2 weeks ago so it might not stay that way, that said Iam going to be optmistic here and say it is going to continue this way. The service was really good, the manager came out to check on our food and see if eveything was okay. 
We really loved the fact that the kids menu was real food and not just frozen food reheated up. The cheese pizza my son ordered look just like the margarita flatbread. The food was real good. We ordered the pretzel sticks and chicken wings, both were real good. We also ordered the chiptole salmon salad. I was worried because I am really not a chiptole fan but the salad had none of that in it. But it was filled with spinach, grilled BBQ Salmon, Creamy Avacadoes, black beans.... it was great. We didn&#39;t get any dessert but looking over on the other tables it looked good. 

I hope the best for this place!!!"

Service was excellent. Very friendly and even gave us some examples of what the in house chef does for daily dinner specials.  Food is fresh and made in house.  Beer is really cold.  Chicken quesadilla had smokey grilled chicken and guacamole that made it one if the best I&#39;ve had in a while.  We&#39;ll be back to give dinner a try.

The place is nice on the inside with a ton of seating. Probably only 3 other tables were taken and we sat right at the front. Our waitress was friendly. I started with a cup of their broccoli cheese soup which was very good but seemed overprice at $4 for a small cup. My friends all got salads and loved them. I went with the Mezza Platter and asked for extra pita. It was pretty good, I loved the Tzatiki sauce and the spicy feta. The hummus was ok but lacked flavor. I also had a soda and my bill came to $15 plus tip. Overall I would go back and try something else, it was good I just wasn&#39;t wowed."

Was pleasantly surprised by the service. He (our server)was very sweet and did a great job. I was a bit taken a back when they didn&#39;t have the very common type of vodka for my Bloody Mary. Any &#34;pub&#34; should be stocked with all the basics. My first Bloody Mary was good, spicy like I asked. The second was not spicy at all. They were only $5 each, so I didn&#39;t bother to complain. Looking though the menu, I was struck by all the very heavy choices and for lack of a better word BORING dishes. Almost all of the menu was priced very high for what you&#39;re getting. I decided to go with the gyro special. It was only $3 so how could I go wrong? Well, it was edible, I&#39;ll give it that but the meat was super greasy, everything else was very bland. This restaurant is really cute inside and the obviously has at least one good server. If you just up your food game a bit and maybe revamp your menu, you would have a real winner on your hands. Can&#39;t say I would return, those prices! Besides, there are just so many other places out there that are similar but taste better."

This was our first visit to Anthony&#39;s and was really looking forward to it. I mean, when you look at the amount of work and $$$ that was put into a beautiful restaurant,  you&#39;d think hiring a great chef would be top priority. Our waitress was in training, but she was still attentive and had a great attitude. We ordered the chorizo spring roll appetizers, which tasted like store bought egg rolls with spice in it. My husband had the &#34;Juicy Lucy&#34;, which was not juicy at all, had absolutely no flavor, and something tasted burned. My fish and chips, looked and tasted like frozen fish sticks. No flavor, overcooked, and the coleslaw was terrible.
This place has sooooooo much potential and I may give them another shot in a year or so (if they make it that long).. I hope that gives them enough time to find a new chef and fix that menu!!!!"

It is very nice, all new, inviting, tons of tvs, great huge center bar, amazing 3 season eating area with another full bar, pool table, darts, and opening garage doors to make it feel outdoors.   
Now the food....  extensive menu which worries me.  Not enough traffic in this place to support such a different menu.  I had the flat bread Greco which had gyros meat on it.   It wasn&#39;t fresh gyros meat from the spit, it was the refrigerate kind you buy at the store.   My wife had the southwest pasta and although the flavors were good it was mushy pasta and drenched in butter and cheese so you couldn&#39;t taste the flavors.   My son had burger and fries which he devoured and enjoyed.  The burger didn&#39;t look hand made, it was to perfectly pressed and round..... my daughter had nachos which were good but the guacamole was store bought as well as the salsa.   
Great looking place but lacked flavor.  We will try again to find something on the menu we enjoy."

We got calamari, Juicy Lucy burger, and Chicken Pasta.  The calamari was devoid of flavor and literally crumbled to bits when we tried to eat it.  The burger and pasta were OK, but still lacking in seasoning.  The portions on the entrees were pretty good which helped.

A little salty. Then we split the Chorizo flatbread; or it could have been called salt bomb.

Triple decker! And a great queso fundido.  The service was a little green but we just found out they&#39;ve only been open for a week so I&#39;ll give them that.

It was a mistake I&#39;ll never make again. First when we get there we are seated and are left waiting over 15 minutes for service. The place wasn&#39;t even packed. When the waitress finally did come to us she was rude and seemed rushed. We ordered 2 drinks and an order of nachos. I kid you not less than a minute later our nachos came out! They were by far the nastiest tasting nachos I&#39;ve ever had. They obviously used cheese from a can. To make matters worse both our drinks were pure sugar and there was no sign of alcohol in the $9 plus drink. We paid our bill and left. I&#39;m not a picky person and this is my first time leaving a negative review like this. Think twice about coming here. Wouldn&#39;t surprise me if this place closes within a year.

Food was okay just for appetizer,  didn&#39;t try anything else because we felt unsatisfied with the service and food. Whoever was the bartender I don&#39;t know where they found him but he was awful. I also used a 25% off coupon just for appetizer cause I wanted to leave from this shit bar service. I decided to go to TGIF Fridays down the street which exceeds a far better family friendly environment and service is top notch. Maybe the bartender should see what real service is like.

He was very polite and respectful. The wife and I had the Juicy Lucy Burger. It was cooked perfectly. Highly recommended. We&#39;ll definitely be back to eat or watch sporting events."

Food was mediocre. Boyfriend got the club sandwich and it was overpowered by the amount of greens on it. The fish of the fish n chips appeared to be premade/frozen. On the pricey side. Most likely will not return.

Since I was not able to pull up a beer list I passed at the time only to return a couple of days later for lunch with several co-workers. I was told about the previous venue in this location and those who were local were impressed with how it had been turned around into this new venue. But enough about this... let&#39;s talk food &amp; beer.
Beer menu isn&#39;t the greatest... but it could also be a lot worse.Pretty heavy on the Big 3 and a decent craft beer selection in bottle/can/draught. My go-to while there was the 80-Acre on tap.
Food menu isn&#39;t overly complicated... yet enough to make me think of it almost as gastropub kind of food. For this lunch I ordered the Anthony&#39;s Club Sandwich on sourdough with fries. When my meal came out... I knew I was in trouble. That sandwich was huge!!! I managed to down half of it before I threw in the towel and had to ask for a box. 1 regular sized take-out box would have barely been enough to hold this whole sandwich... but enough room for half and my fries.

Fast forwards to SuperBowl Sunday. The area was being hit by a pretty decent snow storm... the nearby mall was closed by 2pm... some places were loosing power. But I wanted to watch the game somewhere that wasn&#39;t my hotel room. So I headed up to Anthony&#39;s again after calling to make sure they&#39;d be open. And thus began my small march through a couple of appetizers...
First up were the Chorizo Spring Rolls with a Hoisin Ginger Dipping Sauce. The spring rolls were decent enough that they didn&#39;t need the extra sweetness of the dipping sauce. One critique is that they should have been a bit crispier.
Next up came the Flatbread Mexicano... a flatbread with chorizo, ancho cream, and farmer&#39;s cheese (whatever that means). This was awesome. The flatbread wasn&#39;t overbaked to the point of being overly crispy... and wasn&#39;t too soft that things went limp with you picked up a piece.

If and when I return to the area, I will definitely be visiting here more often."

Not out of this world, but I would definitely eat there again. Wait staff was nice and I really hope they become busy. I&#39;m also glad this restaurant was able to class this area up a bit.

I have been here three times now and I&#39;ve yet to be impressed.  The food is decent but the wait staff needs to be more attentive.  Our waiter was really slow to respond, rarely checked in and took forever to bring us our check.  Then we decided to stick around for additional drinks.  He never came back so we had to go to the bar to order.  I might give them one more shot.  I really want this business to be successful, but their wait staff needs to improve quickly."

The food was ok. Had the Greek platter appetizer and that was great. The spicy feta is one of the most unique dishes I&#39;ve ever had!  Wife ordered gyros and me the juicy lucy. Was not impressed with either. The burger was overcooked (ordered medium and came out burnt).  A small slice of cheese was on the burger.  Was far from juicy!

Yelp is supposed to be completely bias service and they deleted my review because I have not reviewed other places prior to this one, which begs the question why should I use yelp or for that matter anyone use Yelp as they are going to use only reviews that they feel are driven by visits or customer profile. I will be using metro mix at least they are a service that doesn&#39;t pretend to be something they aren&#39;t a sensored service.

It came on a pretezel bun, it was not stuffed instead melted cheese and bacon strips were placed on the over cooked burger.  In fact the burger was so over cooked that all I could taste was char! My husband had the salmon and it too was dry and charred.  His side of rice was dry and the roasted veggies had a strange taste.  When we told the waitress she said sorry and wished she knew sooner.

Was there for mayweather pac fight which was biggest fight promoted in boxing history and the bar even had it advertised on the radio that  it was showing fights and decided to not have a full staff on a Saturday night. Waitress tried so hard but she was literally serving half the bar which was about 30 tables by her self inside and outside. The only good part was how nice it was visually and 2 dollar pints on a weekend but if your not a beer drinker mix drinks were on high end price wise. Oh to top it off 10 dollar cover because of fight.

The only time thing that was a surprise to me was once when we subbed brown rice for white rice. The brown rice was good, but it seemed much more like wild rice to me and didn&#39;t really go with my dish. I&#39;ve stuck with white rice since. Other than that, highly recommend."

They have a wide selection of salads; I think we had the house salad with ginger dressing, which really impressed several of the vegans.  The Crazy Noodles are highly recommended; the fried tofu was surprisingly tasty (sometimes this can be a bit bland); the vegetable curry was also excellent.  They do offer veggie dumplings (steamed or deep fried - nice!) and veggie eggrolls.  In addition to the usual Thai noodle standards, they have a couple of Japanese options (soba; udon).  As most Thai places do, you can get any entree with chicken, tofu, vegetables (and a couple of other options - salmon?) and you can even sub in brown rice.

If they hadn&#39;t been weird about the number in our party, this would have been a great. As it is, the group won&#39;t be back but I probably will."

I&#39;ve ordered take out, eaten in, and ordered delivery - that&#39;s how good they are. Their only weakness may be their pad thai, which tends to be a little dry, and the quality of the chicken used, which other reviewers have mentioned. But their yellow curry is unbelievable, great pad see ew, awesome veggie dumplings. They also have some of the best soups I&#39;ve ever had at a thai place - tom kha beyond your wildest dreams, always hot and sweet, vinegary and flavorful. I crave it whenever I&#39;m sick these days. Seriously, don&#39;t waste your time anywhere else. 

I&#39;ve never had to wait to eat in, so I hope they&#39;re doing okay! When you do eat in, it&#39;s a casual but very clean place, with warm decor and a TV if you&#39;re in the mood for it.

But, the chicken that was both in my tum yum style soup and the stir fry tasted funky.  It had a rubbery taste and I couldn&#39;t even finish my meal.  My husband said his beef dish was okay.  We haven&#39;t been back since the day we went there.  Maybe the other meat dishes are good but definitely not the chicken I ordered."

The service was very slow but I think that was due to a surprising amount of customers there on a lazy afternoon; they were swamped!

The food was fresh, well cooked, and delicious. I went with three other adults and three children; nobody walked away disappointed! Even the notoriously picky young man who came with us ate everything he was given very happily.

I loved their Thai iced tea, and really enjoyed the panang curry. I would definitely get this again! The combo sampler appetizer that we split at the table was a good appetizer for two people and walked me through the basic appetizers pretty well. There were a few things on it that I didn&#39;t particularly care for but didn&#39;t dislike either (the shumai, in particular) but the crab rangoon and egg rolls were pretty delicious!

My wife had the Tom Kha soup, a coconut milk soup (with many other fresh and delicious ingredients). She really liked it and said she&#39;d have it next time we visit.

There will definitely be a next time. Maybe this weekend!"

You can place a reservation. The restaurant is small so if you have a larger party, it&#39;s worth doing. The restaurant is very clean, the waitstaff are really friendly (and very helpful). Prices are reasonable.

I was here recently with a group of five. Even with a number of alcoholic drinks (I think it averaged out to around 2 beers a person) our bill essentially came up to about 25$/person.

There&#39;s a diverse drink &amp; food menu. A note: they actually have some items that I typically associate with Japanese restaurants (Ramune, which is essentially sprite) and udon along with soba. 

The flavor profiles across the board (from the appetizers - chicken dumplings &amp; gyoza; to the mains - spicy basil fried rice, pad thai, yaki udon, thai ginger sauce + chicken, &amp; the thai cashew sauce +beef) were what I was hoping for. There was a variation of sweet and heat which I&#39;m normally left feeling shortchanged by when I get Thai. It was nicely balanced, and well made.

(I note that other reviewers had issues with the chicken - of our five entrees, we ordered 3 with chicken and there was nothing wrong with any of it. It could be that they&#39;ve since upgraded where they were getting their ingredients from, but as this was my first time here I can&#39;t say for certain.)

I will absolutely return here in the future, and would recommend it to others."

Other than the typical dishes we always order from a Thai place like Pad Thai, green curry, basil chicken, tom yum soup and fried rice, we have also discovered the Crazy noodles and panang curry from VIP Thai. Both of them are really good. I liked the Crazy noodles a lot. And I was told the rice noodles was homemade. Nice.

The services were always great. Once we came in with 5 kids in one big table. The waiter kindly provided the plastic water cups with the lid and always put the hot dishes on the parents side of the table. 

They are still running the promotion for $5 off $25 dinning-in."

Damn. Guess I&#39;m no VIP... I mean, I only eat Thai food every.damn.day. 

So I see VIP Thai pop up on my Hot New Business feed on Yelp last night and made a memo to get there STAT today.  

I walked in to one guy working and an otherwise empty restaurant, but I also eat at off hours so it&#39;s pretty typical for places to be near or completely empty when I go in. I had checked out their menu online and knew ahead of time that I wants the shrimp rolls (shrimp wrapped in wonton skin and fried), the tom yum soup with tofu and the spicy basil leaves with tofu, extra spicy. 

I ordered my food totaling just under $20 + $4 tip and walked over to Starbucks to grab something caffeinated because I like to use it as an appetite suppressant, especially when before eating Thai food as my hunger for spicy Thai dishes is simply insatiable. My food took about 10ish minutes and I waited outside in their front alfresco dining area until the guy working inside kindly brought my food right out to me. 

When I got home I ate all $20 worth of food in one sitting, because like I said, my appetite for this type of cuisine is inhuman... or maybe I have a tapeworm that favors Thai. My rundown of the meal is as follows:

+ Shrimp rolls wrapped in wonton skin and fried - $5.95 
I was hoping they&#39;d be like the shrimp cigars at Thai Pot in DG, only much cheaper at $5.95, but sadly, they were not. They weren&#39;t bad, just not very flavorful and a tad too simple for my tastes. It was just the basic shrimp and the fried wonton ish. At Thai Pot they make they with some kind of magic spices (though they aren&#39;t spicy or hot or anything) and there&#39;s a full basil leaf rolled around the shrimp before they&#39;re wrapped with the wonton. I should also mention that there are only four rolls and they are REALLY skinny with little shrimp, not like the large, juicy, thick shrimp at TP. I was expecting to be disappointment and not feel very full after these, but they was actually quite a bit of shrimp stuffed into those fried tubes- so still not a bad deal for $5.95. 

+  Tom Yum Soup w/ Tofu - $3.50
It was great, had a wee bit of a kick and the tofu bits were much smaller than other places but you still got a lot of them and the consistency overall was nice. I would&#39;ve liked to see some more mushrooms or larger bits of mushrooms but I&#39;d still consider this dish the standout for my take-out dinner. I will absolutely be back for a large order next time. 

+ Spicy Basil Leaves w/ Tofu (requested extra spicy)- $8.95
It wasn&#39;t the greatest looking SBL I&#39;ve ever gotten and I think that&#39;s due in part to the lack of color in the dish. Not a lot of peppers or vegetable variety and it had a more oily, heavy taste to it than I&#39;m used to and veered a bit toward the taste of Chinese food, which is one of my least favorite cuisines as whole. I don&#39;t feel like this dish was the best it could be and wasn&#39;t a fan of the lack of variety in flavor. It was a bit spicy, but nothing much and certainly not the extra, extra spicy I&#39;d requested. 

They just opened this month so I have to give them credit for the smooth and swift service I received, but I do think that 2 of my 3 dishes could have been better. I will absolutely be back as their soup options look delightful and I&#39;m pretty sure they do miso in large bowls. Yay! Also, I&#39;m excited as heck to have another option for Thai food near my current housing situation so I feel it&#39;s my duty to patronize them and support the cause."

The dishes seem pretty standard and what I had struck me more as Chinese than Thai. I know elements of Thai cuisine reflect Chinese cooking because it was brought to the area, but it just didn&#39;t seem incredibly authentic.

The Crab Rangoon is pretty decent. It has a nice flavor, but it admittedly lacks real crab. As far as I can tell, it had the signature scallions, but they seemed to be chopped larger than normal or else there was another type of vegetable in there. I also ordered the Spicy Thai Basil with Beef and it was very spicy to me, but I found it odd that Jalapeños were in the dish instead of Thai Chilies. The dish itself looked beautiful with all of the different colored Bell Peppers. I might go with a Curry next time.

Order the Thai Iced Tea. It was actually the best thing I had. The Iced Tea is very strong and flavorful. I think they might use a little more Condensed Milk or a better quality than other places because it&#39;s the best I&#39;ve had!

Service was decent, although a little slow even though there weren&#39;t many people there. I was eating alone, so it was kind of nice to watch the large TV playing news and Olympic coverage. It was a bit loud though, so I imagine it would have been annoying if I were trying to have a conversation."

We moved to the area a little over a year ago and have tried several Thai places.  This was our 1st visit.  Being of SouthEast Asian background,  I know my authentic Thai flavors pretty well.  I always order beef pad see ewe (with crispy noodles) at every Thai place and they have the BEST version that tastes just like my mom&#39;s. Most places make the sauce too sweet or put too much sauce.  It was perfect.  Other dishes we ordered were beef fried rice, thai spicy noodle and seafood noodles.  All were delicious and perfect portion size. On top of that we ordered 3 appetizers:  soft shell crab (ok), chicken eggrolls(bland) and chicken satay(good), soda and Thai iced coffee and even mango coconut sticky rice (good) for dessert.  Total was around $87 for 4 adults which is pretty darn reasonable.  Restaurant is clean with a cozy atmosphere.  Decor is colorful and modern. Service was great but speed was lacking just a little.  I believe they are short staffed because only 3 people were working.  Our waiter was the best.  He was the only one running around taking orders at every table, serving and cleaning while the other ladies just sat people and refilled drinks.  He was so funny and made our evening enjoyable.

Any time I go to a Thai place, I get the Pad Thai. Always. It&#39;s a pretty basic dish at any Thai restaurant, so I&#39;d expect they&#39;d know how to do it right. For starters, the chicken as other have previously mentioned, was so chewy that it couldn&#39;t even be eaten. I pulled all of the chicken off and put it to the side, thinking I&#39;d still enjoy the noodles and vegetables... wrong. The noodles were mushy and the entire thing was bland, like it was completely missing the sauce.

The only positive to our meal was that delivery was fast, and the delivery driver was very friendly. I won&#39;t be placing another order, however. Thai Pot and Thai Happiness in Downers Grove are both MUCH better."

Enjoyed the Tom Yum Shrimp soup and the chicken egg rolls. The Thai-Style Spicy Noodles was one of the Chef Recommendation and was amazing. Seafood Madness and Sesame Chicken were also thoroughly enjoyed by our party. 

Thai Iced Green Tea was almost a desert, very enjoyable. Server was excellent and he was very helpful with great recommendations. A great hidden gem tucked in by the theatre.

I found a $5 off coupon on their menu link, on dine-in orders over $25. Very reasonably priced. Extremely fresh items served promptly. You too will be a fan."

Unfortunately I was caught up in conversation during the cashing out process and realized once I got home that I had been given the wrong change. Having worked in the industry I understand that mistakes happen and thought I would just call and give the server the chance to make things right. I let him know that I live right next to the restaurant, enjoyed the food and look forward to being a regular.
He made some excuse about the coupon being not valid (which I highly doubt because I read it thoroughly). But if that was the case why didn&#39;t he come back to the table with the coupon and said something and give the coupon back??? He had no answer to that question. 
I had tipped more than 20% on the original (not the discounted price) and so for him to pocket the extra $5 from my coupon just fattened his wallet that much more. 
It&#39;s discouraging when you give someone the opportunity to do the right thing and create a long term customer that would tip well and they choose to take advantage of the situation and steal your money. 
I was really disappointed about the whole experience and probably wont visit or recommend this place to anyone.

The woman who answered was really nice.  We ordered the Crab Rangoon, Rama Sauce Tofu, Crazy Noodle and a Thai Iced Tea (b/c those are my fav).  I knew I was going to like the place as soon as she said &#34;OK, see you in 5-10 min&#34; - That&#39;s my kind of place!  I&#39;m hungry now, not 30 min from now... That&#39;s me hangry, not hungry.

I was delighted when I got there (we live like 1.25 miles away) and the food was already bagged and ready to go.  The place is small but so clean, cozy and friendly.  The woman at the front hadn&#39;t made my tea yet b/c she didn&#39;t want it to melt.  How nice!  Oh, and get this... They made a small paper rose out of the straw paper.  How adorable, right?

Fast forward to our family room when we are unloading the bag... I&#39;m delighted b/c the Rama sauce is actually thick!  Every Thai restaurant in the burbs does it wrong except this place.  It&#39;s supposed to be a thick, peanuty goodness.  The places we&#39;ve tried are runny and barely taste like peanut.  Well done, VIP.  Hubby enjoyed his Crazy Noodle and the Crab Rangoon was perfectly made.  Not gross, fingers drenched in oil that you feel like you gained 5 lbs from eating one.  Light, crispy and filled to the brim.

I am ecstatic this little place is so close to home and that it is so delicious!  It is up there with my favorite Thai place in Wrigleyville.  Highly suggest you try it if you&#39;re in the area.  Topper?  Coldstone is right next door!  If you dine in and want to save room for something else, go grab some ice cream or Starbucks which is two doors down."

I am a Pad Thai lover and I ordered it from here last year and it was not good.  I usually only get Pad Thai from Thai restaurants so I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d be back.  Tonight I had a taste for Thai and thought I&#39;d try something else there.  I had the Crab Rangoons (the were FANTASTIC) plus the Panang Curry with Brown Rice and Chicken.  It was so flavorful and had a great mix of sauce, chicken, broccoli and carrot pieces.   I will definitely be going back from this meal again!  The 1 star was knocked off because they need to improve their Pad Thai.  I see from another recent reviewer that I am not the only one that was not a fan of the Pad Thai."

Shouldve known because when I asked how long it would take they said 5 minutes so I assume it was just heated up in a microwave. Ordered takeout for four. I got the orange chicken.. It was sooooo hard. And bland and the Miso soup so salty. My hubby got pad Thai with tofu. He hated it. A coworker got the pad Thai with chicken... Still gross. The only person who liked their food was my boss who ordered some kind of soup doused with hot sauce. It&#39;s so close to home I could walk there but I just don&#39;t think so. Not again.

I went with the lunch portion of Penang Curry with chicken, which is generally one of my favorite Thai dishes.  My food quickly came and looked delicious.  I got a scoop of white rice, the curry and some carrots and broccoli on the side.  It wasn&#39;t too spicy, if I ordered it again I might ask for it to be a little spicier.  It wasn&#39;t very expensive, $6-7 if I remember correctly.  However I ate every bite of it and still felt like I could have had something more.

Papaya salad was pretty good. Very authentic and tasted clean.

I live in Seven Bridges and for months I kept an eagle eye on VIP Thai, waiting for the &#34;coming soon&#34; signs to come down and the doors to open. You see, I hate driving almost as much as I love Thai food and the idea of a Thai place so close to me was irresistible. 

The Dude and I first went to VIP Thai during their &#34;soft opening.&#34; At that point, things weren&#39;t running smoothly. It took forever for our server to come see us (the people next to us even left!) and the poor people waiting for takeout were there for a good 45 minutes. That said, I&#39;m glad we stuck it out because my pineapple curry was amazing and so we The Dude&#39;s crazy noodles. 

I&#39;ve been back twice for takeout and have called in my orders ahead of time just in case they were still lagging on preparing things. Both times my order was ready within 10 minutes and waiting for me. The pad thai with tofu is delicious - the tofu is done just the way I like it and the noodles have that nice almost-crispness to them. I order it extra spicy because that&#39;s how I roll. 

Everyone I&#39;ve encountered there has also been very friendly - always a plus! 

Tip: Their online ordering system doesn&#39;t work. When you search for &#34;VIP Thai,&#34; it says there are no restaurants by that name. Save yourself the headache and call &#39;em instead."

I had absolutely no idea this place even existed until I had to stop over at the doctor&#39;s office.
On my first trip in, I ordered the Tom Yum soup with shrimp and the Penang curry with chicken. Prices are excellent! Only $12 for both and good sized portions for leftovers.
The food I was not absolutely impressed with. Tom Yum soup was too much broth and not enough veggies. When I ordered the shrimp I only got 3 (and they weren&#39;t de-vained too well). The Penang curry was pretty good and they give you large amounts of chicken. 
Only issue is the chicken was really slimy tasting like it had been sitting in water before it was cooked. I felt slightly sick the next day. Since I had lots of leftovers, I ended up throwing it in a pan and cooking the chicken some more which was a good idea on my part. Next time I think I&#39;m ordering it with tofu though....

I found the food excellent; the Chicken Satay was a work of art almost too nice to eat. In addition to the appetizer we had Cashew Sauce Chicken and Mild Yellow Curry both dishes were excellent, however if you truly want mild curry you should ask them to cut back on the curry and go for extra mild it will still be spicy enough for most diners.

It&#39;s kind of like a chipotle for pizza, they have a variety of toppings and sauces to choose from. The menu is pretty simple and it&#39;s a pretty unique concept for a pizza place that I haven&#39;t seen before. 

I ordered a garden salad and was actually pretty impressed with it. It had chicken with spinach and mixed greens with delicious cherry tomatoes, a unique kind of roasted red (not exactly a red pepper) pepper, as well as onion and artichokes, served with a vinaigrette dressing.  Blended together very well and exceeded expectations from a place that specializes in pizzas.

My only minor complaints would be that for $8.55 I would&#39;ve like to see a little more chicken, and it was just a little salty. Other than that though the portion size was good and it definitely got the job done for a healthy lunch.

While Geneva has more than enough pizza places, what really sets Doughocracy apart is its speed (pizzas ready to eat in less than five minutes) and sauce, which is slightly sweet and absolutely addicting. 

The pizzas are prepared right in front of you behind a cafeteria-style glass shield,  and if you prefer, you can customize your own pie. I usually order the Margherita, with extra mozzarella, and can polish the entire thing off in minutes. The quality and taste are outstanding.

Doughocracy offers craft beers and a few desserts as well, but it is worth noting that the restaurant has more of a Chipotle-like atmosphere. This is fast-casual dining at its best, so do not expect table service. That said, you can order pizzas to go, and it&#39;s a convenient option when my husband steps off the train platform just a few doors down.

Interior: feels like an Italian Qdoba. Very open, nice tables and booths. It gets busy around dinner, occasionally a lack of seating is an issue.

Food: very tasty, they have quite a few options for meats, sauces, and vegetables. However, some did not appear to be fresh.

Timeliness: takes 2 to 3 minutes to move through the line, and another 5 to get your pizza.

It seemed like they were training staff as they were still new when we visited, and it definitely took more than 5 minutes. Also, the room and seating was cold and not very comfortable. Definitely a &#34;fast casual&#34; restaurant environment.

But like I said, the pizza was good! We went with the Super Sada and the Wine and Dine. Both were awesome. We shared and still had leftovers. They had the soda machine with tons of options -- I think the pepsi one -- and some craft beers on tap which was pretty cool.

I can&#39;t wait to visit again to try more of their signature pies, like the Vegetarian Nightmare and the Gorgonzilla! Hoping my next visit is 5 stars! ;) Maybe take out is the way to go here?"

Husband and I went there on a Friday night and it was super busy. We were able to place our orders and find a table without a problem. I ordered the Green Mile and my husband ordered the Gorgonzilla, but he asked them to sub feta instead since gorgonzola tastes like how my dog&#39;s feet smell. About 10 mins later, we got our pizzas. Unfortunately, the feta cheese never made it onto my husband&#39;s pizza but I ain&#39;t even mad: that shit was DELISH. However, my pizza was even better and I ate the whole thing in record time. $9 for a huge single-serving pie is a deal.

Another thing that makes me infinitely happy is that they have sparkling water on tap. That&#39;s so unique and I absolutely love it. Doughocracy is a winner and we can&#39;t wait to go back."

This place works similarly to how Subway or Chipotle work; basically, you get a pizza crust and pick the rest of the ingredients, including sauces and cheeses, for a set price. There is also an option to get one of the &#34;pre assembled pizzas&#34; or pizzas they have on the menue and ones they&#39;ll build for you without input. Everything is fresh and delicious with many different choices. The set pricing, and no extra charges, for any of the ingredients is extra nice. This place is worth a try and I hope they stick around. 

P.S. They have a good beer selection to go with the pizza."

I tried the sweet BBQ once aand that&#39;s all I get now. So fresh. This is the closest thing in the area to real pizza in Italy. Nice and thin. Stop in and see for yourself.

And there was grease running down my fingers. Not very much sausage on the pizza, maybe a piece or two on each slice. It&#39;s like going to Subway but instead of a sandwich you get a pizza. I guess you are supposed to pick your toppings but no one told us we were supposed to do that. Staff was not very helpful. I will go to a mom and pop pizza place next time instead."

This place delivers.  (not like driving delivers, but it delivers in taste and quality).  The crust was thin but sturdy, and the toppings were fresh and delicious.  They had a great selection of toppings.  Their margarita was perfectly balanced.  Fresh mozzarella, basil, and tomato sauce that shone through as a display of the Italian flag itself. It was great.

 They also have a draft beer selection here, which is incredibly cool for a chipotle-type build your own place.  

They also had a gooey-butter cake for sale that I got in trouble for eating all of when we got home... (married men, you&#39;ll understand).  Sorry, it was too good."

You can build your own pizza for a very reasonable 8.95 or choose from one of their options. And when they say build your own, they mean it. We could even split the pizza in half with toppings. 

Their sauces include BBQ, pesto, tomato or just regular EVOO. Cheeses had a mix of Smoked Mozzerella or Gorgonzola to name a few and you could have several cheeses on your pizza. The vegetable toppings were plentiful including fresh Basil, roasted garlic, black or kalamata olives....the list could go on.

They have craft beer available. Also available are a couple dessert drink options.

The only drawback is that the seating area is kind of cramped-if this area gets big traffic (which I hope it does) it could get claustrophobic pretty quick. But all in all I really liked my meal here and I will return."

Today was not so great. Usually the portions for the toppings are fairly generous.  Today they were not. I know it is not a Chicago style pizza with loads of cheese and pepperoni. But 8 slices of pepperoni on a pizza sliced into 8 servings. 1 per slice is not enough in my opinion. Sauce, cheese 6 basil leaves on a margherita pizza not even one per slice. Quality is great but in previous visits it seemed to be a better value. Will try again because we really like the product but if we have the same experience it will be our last."

We love both the house selected topping pizzas and the build your own pizzas as well. The toppings are fresh and more than they typical pizza place and good salads as well.

The pizzas are out of the oven before you know it and it seams to stay warm a long time. 

Our only problem and I advise you to stay away from is the wine. It comes in a plastic cup with a plastic cover on it and you peal it off to drink. It had a awful taste to it not just like cheap house wine... you can honestly taste the plastic after taste in your mouth and TRUST ME it is not pleasant at all. I worried i had a bad serving and asked the man sitting next to it and he told me he has to throw it away it was so bad. It honestly was the worst wine I have ever had in my life.

The place was empty so I was a little worried.  But by 12:30 the place was packed.  The seating is a little tight and once the place filled up and I was asked more than once to scoot in so someone could squeeze through.  I also didn&#39;t like that people had to carry their pizzas above my head because of the tight space.

Since it was lunch we decided to split a couple things.  We ordered one of the signature pizzas, The Smokeshow, which has sausage, red onion and smoked mozzarella.  The toppings were very good and the red onion added a nice sweetness.  I didn&#39;t really taste the smoke, but the mozzarella was good.  The crust was above average, although they may need to tweak the cooking time to firm up the bottom crust. I had to support the slice with two hands so I didn&#39;t lose the toppings.  

We also ordered the Italian Stallion salad, which was amazing.  It comes with mixed greens, fresh mozzarella, pepperoni, roasted red peppers, artichokes and sliced banana peppers.  Its served on pizza dough with the dressing mixed in.  Next time I will get the dressing on the side as it did seem oily, but delicious anyway.  

The prices are very reasonable and the cost for our meal was only $9 each and we did not finish the pizza or the salad.  We chose to just drink water, although they have soft drinks and a limited selection of beer and wine.  

I will definitely be back as this is a great addition to Geneva."

Despite the high level of customization the end result just did not blow me away. I find the crust a little bland and unexciting. It is a step above crummy chain pizza, but a lot of establishments do pizza well. This is a value oriented dining experience. Perhaps they make up for it with the price of a fountain beverage, but a twelve inch pizza with as many toppings as you want for$8.95 is a really good deal. The Pepsi machine is good, but it is not quite as good as the Freestyle Coke machine. The service is really quick. The times I have been here, the availability of seating has not been an issue."

My honey and I stumbled upon this place as we were headed to Barrel+Rye last week and vowed to come back. They make it  very simple and easy to create your own  pizza with fresh ingredients or you can choose from their menu of signature flavors. For starters, we ordered the roasted veg salad and it was so good. Their salads can either come as a regular salad or on top of a pizza crust. We decided to just get the regular salad, as we knew we were going to get 2 pizzas. We tried the bae-b-que and gorgonzilla pizzas and we tore them up! If you like arugula like I do, I would suggest that you order extra. I am not going to lie, the dough filled with nutella and marshmallows had my mouth watering, but we&#39;re going to save that for next time. I almost forgot to mention the pop machine. They have the new machine that allows you to select different pepsi products where you can add flavors such as vanilla, cherry, and etc. I will caution you that if you are a germaphobe like I am, you will need to wipe this machine off before you touch it because you will see numerous, nasty marks from kids having played with the touchscreen."

It was my first time at Doughocracy. If you&#39;re familiar with Pie Five, this place is very similar. The differences are better crust, cooks in less time, 3.5 minutes, and a larger size personal pizza. The staff here are friendly and one girl gave me her suggestion on customizing and I took her advice and glad I did. The process is you order a pizza from their signature pies at the counter or pick your toppings if you&#39;re making a customized pie, get a drink and pick a table to sit at.  Doughocracy&#39;s crust is a Neapolitan crust, thin, bubbly, airy.  My favorite crust!  You can also order a salad for lunch if you don&#39;t want a pizza, but ...why? Their pizza is the bomb!  When the pizza is ready, they&#39;ll call your name and you pick up your order at the counter.  I took the advice of the girl at the counter and customized my pizza with all her favs...pesto, kalamata olives, feta, sun dried tomatoes and chicken. It was soon good. My husband chose one of their signature pizzas, the BBQ chicken. He enjoyed it. We both really liked our pizzas, especially the crust. I recommend this restaurant for a quick bite to eat...they have a quality product."

My wife and I shared a Margarita pizza and a Spaghetti and Meatball pizza.  At $8.95 for a high quality 9&#34;-10&#34; thin crust, the New York style pizza was a good value (one pizza would have been enough for us to share). Also, at $1.95 for an all you can drink soft drink - it was nice not being gouged. Doughocracy has the Pepsi Spire (Pepsi&#39;s equivalent to Coke&#39;s Freestyle Machine) which features Pepsi, Diet Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Dr. Pepper, Sierra Mist, and more with optional Cherry, Lemon, Vanilla, and Strawberry flavorings. 

The pizza offered a good balance of sauce, cheese, toppings, and crust (a little thicker crust in the middle would help support the slice and make it easier to pull apart at the cuts).   With a nice variety of featured pies and ingredients for the build your own pie, there is something for everyone. 

The featured dessert - called the Nutella Bomb (Nutella and Marshmallow folded into a pizza crust - Calzone style) - looked delicious as the three children next to us devoured one. Too bad we had filled ourselves up on our entrees.  Something else to try on our next visit. 

A word of caution about the dining area. We observed a man with a child in a stroller leaving the restaurant because he was unable to navigate the seating area.  The aisle ways are very tight and are stroller, wheelchair, and mobility scooter inaccessible. Under the current floor plan, it appears the only handicapped or stroller accessible table is the one closest to the soft drink dispenser (only if entering and leaving the restaurant via the Fulton Street entrance on the side). 

Overall, a great concept with a bright future. Welcome to Geneva."

You can choose one of their own pizzas (I think there is 8) or create your own. My son about died when he saw you could put spaghetti on your pizza so that will be our next choice! They pop it in the oven and it is done in just a few minutes! 

My only complaint is that they didn&#39;t have plates, you have to cut pizza (a sin I know but I have a toddler) on a napkin which was a pain but I totally can look passed that because the pizza was that good. 

Can&#39;t wait to go again!!!

We were fortunate to find a family leaving so we grabbed their table and dined on the best pizza we&#39;ve had in a long time. It&#39;s like a Chipotle but for pizza -customize it just how YOU want it - in only a few minutes we had yummy pizza and cold beer. Definitely try their &#39;butter cake&#39;, mmmm! 10/10, would visit again (and again, and again, and again)"

They have a great selection and regardless of what you want on your pizza, you pay only one price.  We were in on a Sunday night not long after they had opened (back in December 2015).  It was busy and they were a bit understaffed and inexperienced.  One of the owners wives had come in with her kids.  She immediately sat them down and went to work clearing tables and helping out with the dining room operation.  It had an immediate impact.

To anyone who loves NYC style pizza ( not the NYC slice joints, they suck) but the good stuff, do yourself a favor and go here.   The few constructive comments  would be that the oven should be hotter, (a little charring is a good thing) and watching the pizza being made is not a huge selling point, good pizza is!

I called this location and spoke to Denise/Dave and wanted to place an order over the phone, pay by CC and asked if they could deliver it to me curbside. I had just picked my dog up from the vet and was going to pull up and if they would just walk it to the front of their door. I was wiling to pay for delivery. 

They said &#34; Sorry, were short staffed and swamped&#34; I think I lost my mind. Did you say &#34; You wouldn&#39;t walk the sandwich to your front door?&#34; Am I hearing this right. I was pulling into the strip mall as Im having this conversation and I couldn&#39;t believe it. There was only 4 cars in the parking lot!!! WTF! Way to go on customer service. 

With all the food options that are out there you would think that you would do what you can for each customer. I&#39;m shocked that this happens to this day. 

If you love JJ sandwiches give your money to any other location or just go to Jersey Mikes! 

Oh and one last thing, I called customer service and I was told I would get a call back within 24 hours........ still waiting."

I have them replace the cheese and mayo for a drizzle of Olive oil and extra cucumbers and tomatoes.  My sandwich is huge and delicious. On that note the place is great... But if you try to have them walk your sandwich to the front door or the curb right out their front door...
That won&#39;t happen. I was starving and was driving home with my sick child. I am juicing and have been for the past 36 days. I didn&#39;t want to run the juicer with her watching tv on the couch, so I thought I would swing by and grab a vegetable sandwich. I called ahead and paid for it over the phone then asked if they could just run it out to my car because I have my 5 year sick in the car. They said no because they were too busy. I couldn&#39;t believe it, since you can pull up right in front. When I walked in they had four employees behind the counter and one customer sitting down.

From the outside I wasn&#39;t too optimistic, but I am glad I went in.  The look and feel is exactly what I look for in a bar, nothing fancy, a lot of cool stuff on the walls, and loads of good beer.

My husband and I were attending a wedding in the area, so we knew a pit stop at Bigby&#39;s was mandatory. Plus, who doesn&#39;t love a little day drinking? We stuck out like sore thumbs being all dressed up in a place like this, but we were welcomed like old friends.

The bartender was alone, but he was efficient---pouring, passing, then starting the process again for the next person. It only took a few minutes for him to make his way over to us and make some suggestions. I also asked about a beer and how it got it&#39;s name and he gave me a really detailed description about it. 

The people that come here are cool. They realize that this place is sacred and not like other bars, so they treat you well too. We had a random conversation with another couple at the bar the entire time we were here. 

I didn&#39;t get to spend as much time here as I&#39;d liked, but I&#39;ll make a special trip to Addison to visit soon. Bigby&#39;s is one of the few places that live up to the hype."

The pizza is really good too! I would mark this a 4 start spot but it can get pretty tight in there pretty quick. So I don&#39;t always think to come here as the seating isn&#39;t always available.

Great rotation of craft beers (though note Sierra Nevada was on at least 3-4 of tap handles the day we went in).

Granted, I only turned 21 this year so I suppose I only actually started caring about where one can get a decent drink recently, but gosh I&#39;m glad I found Bigby&#39;s! Addison doesn&#39;t exactly have a reputation for having anything decent but I&#39;m starting to beg to differ! (See Elio&#39;s, Freddo&#39;s, Zaza&#39;s, etc) Bigby&#39;s has an incredible beer selection, one of which you&#39;re more likely to know fewer beers on the list than you know and taps that rotate daily. If you want to drink pee on tap (aka Bud, Busch, Pabst, etc) or even many macro brews, this isn&#39;t the place for you. Though Bigby&#39;s is definitely mostly a beer place, they do also serve various wines including wine flights for $13. The prices of beers vary. Food is pizza and tapas, though I have yet to get any food here.
The staff is very knowledgeable about what they serve, so ask away if you have questions! They can sometimes come across as cold, which can be off setting, but don&#39;t let that put you out. The clientele is dominantly young adults (and a bit hipster) but, likewise, don&#39;t let that stop you from coming in! The volume isn&#39;t generally loud, there are only 2 TVs (awesome), it&#39;s comfortable and casual in appearance, tables, couches, patio or bar for seating. There is a whole shelving space full of board games which is lots of fun. Bathrooms are shared with Mario&#39;s but they&#39;re fine!
I will note, you sometimes see reviews complaining that they don&#39;t serve hard alcohol and don&#39;t have enough TVs-- well spotted, this isn&#39;t a sports bar and they don&#39;t advertise as such so stop complaining. Also don&#39;t bring your kids here, for Pete&#39;s sake. I&#39;ll cut off my review here, if I get anymore detailed there&#39;ll be no point in a reader going. Do give it a try!"

It has a great dive/local bar feel to it.  The beer selection is great, and the friendly bartender was more than willing to give me a quick sample before making a decision.

The menu here is pretty small, but my food was great.  I tried the &#34;prosciushi&#34; and the latin lover pizza.  The &#34;prosciushi&#34; is house cured prosciutto with fresh arugula and mozzarella rolled up and cut like a sushi roll.  It was fresh and delicious.  The latin lover pizza (chorizo, onion &amp; cilantro) was pretty good as well.

I&#39;ve wondered about this place for quite some time...What is a &#34;pour house?&#34;  Can anything nice be in that building??... and finally popped in with the neighbors.  

Comfy, casual little place with a stunning and ever-revolving variety of beer on tap.  If you&#39;re a connoisseur, this is the place!  Wine is also available but this is definitely a beer place.  The night we stopped in they were playing a trivia game.  It was slow-paced and even though they were calling out stages of the game, it was unobtrusive and a fun aside for non-participants.  

They offer some food...tapas, some pizzas...  We tried the charcuterie platter (good snack for 4 but better for 2) and a small cheese pizza (okay).  Also available are a whole lot of board games.  Hankering for a brutal round of the Game of Life?  This is the place!

There is a patio but it doesn&#39;t seem put to good use.  That&#39;s a shame.  I&#39;m all about the patios if the weather is at all tolerable.  Service struck us at first as a little dry...not particularly helpful...but I&#39;ll chalk that up to style because either we or she quickly warmed up and we found our server to be passionate about the brews and full of good suggestions.

...but here&#39;s the thing.  I&#39;m 49 years old.  This is the first place I&#39;ve ever gone where I felt like an old timer.  lol  Seriously...this is Hipster Central.  College students abounded but not in a raucous kind of way...the mood was happy and chill.  It was just weird to feel like I was in another generation&#39;s territory.  But that&#39;s just me.

They have plenty of comfortable seating including some couches and lounge chairs. They have board and card games on the wall. It wasn&#39;t loud at all when we were there. The bartenders are down to earth and very easy to talk to. They had a $2 off cans special one night while I was in which resulted in $3 16oz cans of daisy cutter.

So I did, as part of an entourage of ten.

We walked in on a Monday night around 9PM and there were very few seats to be had in the house. We scavenged what we could until a few more people had drifted out and finally managed to muster up two tables and enough chairs to accommodate us. I couldn&#39;t begin to tell you all the beers that were ordered, but I can tell you that the whole group enjoyed them as well as the Muddy Pig that we ordered - a chocolate and bacon dessert that hits the spot. 

We opted to play Headbanz, which is one of thirty some games that they have there for patrons to use and enjoy. Bigby&#39;s is like a coffeehouse designed for beer - there&#39;s nothing else like it in the suburbs and very few if any in the city. Go for the beer and the experience as well."

This place is a favorite spot of mine for many reasons. First of all, the staff are all great, very knowledgeable, hospitable, and friendly. Ed the owner has done a great job creating an atmosphere that is easy going, relaxed, and fun. There are always interesting beers on tap and every time I go, I try something new. The food here is great and simple: pizzas, gourmet appetizers, and desserts. The food is always consistent and efficient when it comes to soaking up beer. If you are a beer person or a foodie in general you will definitely appreciate Bigby&#39;s and the vibe they present. Board games, pizza, beer, you can&#39;t go wrong."

This place is intimate, comfortable, and feels warm. I like the selection of board games; it makes the place feel like a local coffee house. I showed up for a Yelp event and we were treated great. The staff, Frankie and Joel, was knowledgeable with their beer recommendations. I drank a Metropolitan lager and a smoked wheat on draft and both tasted great.

For a pub, the food was very impressive. The spicy bacon pizza was really outstanding. The tomato sauce is flavorful with a good kick of heat. The 4-cheese pizza was ok, I would have preferred it with sauce though. And the appetizer with the flatbread and sauce with the goat cheese is not to be missed. I don&#39;t even care for goat cheese, but this app was tremendous. It was like an upscale creamy pizza sauce. The triangular-shaped bread was well seasoned with Italian herbs and came out warm. I don&#39;t know if I could visit there without ordering this dish. 

Parking is a little confusing as I wound up in the Dunkin&#39; Donuts lot next door, but hey, if that&#39;s my biggest complaint, that sounds pretty darn good."

It&#39;s a &#39;bar&#39; in the sense that they serve alcohol, but I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s just beer &amp; wine, no hard liquor or cocktails.  Aside from that, there&#39;s very little separating it from looking and feeling like someone&#39;s basement or a decked-out garage with TV&#39;s and hightop tables.

There&#39;s a shelf full of board games, comfy sofas, a fishtank with 1 fish in it, a wall covered with bottle caps.......overall, it&#39;s a very eclectic assortment of junk that fills the space, and it kinda works?  I&#39;m still on the fence about whether or not the atmosphere is cozy or just too weird.

Drinking environment aside, the only thing that surpasses their number of wall decorations is their brew selection.  I honestly had a difficult time finding something on their beer menu that sounded even remotely familiar, so I finally settled on a white IPA.  Dozens of snazzy beer taps (including a shotgun one--cool!) are displayed above their crowded bar countertop, and some are pretty amusing/unusual.

Because this place is in Addison (read: not at ALL close to either my work, my apartment, or my parent&#39;s home), I don&#39;t imagine I&#39;ll be coming back here anytime soon.  A modest pour of Moscato was $8; yesterday I picked up an entire bottle of Moscato at the local Trader Joe&#39;s for the same price, so I&#39;m having a hard time justifying charging that much for a single glass.

The beer&#39;s not not cheap, but it ain&#39;t no tall boy of Bud Light, either......the least expensive beer I saw was a 9oz for $5, and, unlike the majority of bars on a Wednesday night, they didn&#39;t have any featured specials on ANY night of the week.  So that further discourages me from returning......

I don&#39;t know.  This place might be some people&#39;s cup of tea, but it wasn&#39;t at all what I expected, and that caught me off-guard.  Call me frat-tastic if you want, but I&#39;m all about the noisy pubs with lots of room and daily drink deals.  And what&#39;s the sitsh with that fish in solitary isolation?  Why is he all alone?  Was he put there on fish probation for poor fish behavior?  Did he eat the rest of his tank buddies?  I might never find out."

The staff was super-friendly. The beer selection was ridiculously huge. I love the system of dropping the stones into the beer bottles to get them on tap. That&#39;s just genius. 

Everything I tried on tap was good. And I sampled a bottled cider from the massive wall o&#39; choices too. 

I didn&#39;t feel intimidated not knowing a lot about beer, like how you feel at most bars. And the atmosphere was comfortable, with a nice beer garden outside to head to when it got a bit stuffy inside. 

I&#39;d definitely go back because I want to try the pizza I keep hearing about. It looks and sounds awesome."

I live only about 10 minutes from Bigby&#39;s and finally just manage to check it out. *hanging my head in shame* The stories you hear are true, this place is a swanking good time. An extensive list of on tap beer including prices and alcohol content is conveniently posted on a chalkboard for your ease. Their menu is short and delicious and their selection of board/card games will turn your already fun night into tears of laughter and belly aches, at least for us it did.

Thanks to BPH it was my first time playing Cards Against Humanity and my oh my if you do not have a open mind and a fun sense of humor CAH is definitely not for you, but I can&#39;t remember the last time I laugh so much.

During our laughing session with friends, the bf and I decided to split the Latin Pizza. We both are cilantro lovers and seeing that cilantro will be an ingredient on this pizza we couldn&#39;t say no. The pizza was thin crust and quite delicious with the chorizo, but we couldn&#39;t taste any of the cilantro so we were a bit disappointed. No worries, we&#39;ll just ask for extra cilantro next time.

We had good company, refreshing beers, delicious pizza, and CAH, what more can we ask for? Cheers to a fun-filled night at Bigby&#39;s we&#39;re sure to be back."

They have quite a lot of beers on tap with quite the variety.  They list the beers on the wall with the alcohol content as well as the price which was helpful.

They have a nice patio area outside where you can enjoy some suds with your buds.

There is also a cool system that I had explained as a whichever beer gets voted on the most they&#39;ll eventually get it to serve.

They have a couple of TVs so if you want to catch a game you can, but it&#39;s not so distracting that you feel like you&#39;re just paying money to sit by the people you know and not have good conversation. Also love the board games. Makes for a good time if you&#39;re feeling a little competitive (or just down for some fun).

I have lived in Addison for six years. I have been a member of the Yelp elite community for three years. I am an enthusiastic beer nerd and local business supporter ... who has never been to Bigby.

This place is awesome. If you enjoy a high-quality craft brew sans fist pumping, club music and sweaty bodies, this is your jam. Skip the concept restaurants and overhyped suburban spots and swerve into here. First all, there&#39;s not really a menu. Everything that&#39;s being offered in bottles is displayed in the front on a bookcase on the left when you come in. There&#39;s also a chalkboard with the rotating tap list. I recommend checking out the place on BeerMenus.com before showing up to decide on your first drink. Also, follow them on Facebook because they occasionally have great deals or promos, like $3 off all cans and bottles.

I can&#39;t wait to try the flatbreads, they looked superb coming out of the kitchen the last time I was there. I&#39;ve already been three times since I first stumbled in and can&#39;t wait to make it my regular haunt."

Bigby&#39;s is a favorite of many of us Yelpers. A coworker was looking for somewhere with craft beers to go so I suggested she go to the tried and true favorite.

Before going solo, she decided to invite a couple of us for drinks after work on Friday. Upon arrival, I was happy to see a mixed crowd age-wise because I didn&#39;t want my coworkers to feel out of place or uncomfortable. I was surprised it was completely packed to the brim on a Friday at 5! I couldn&#39;t snag a spot in the parking lot and had to park across the street. We were able to get the last table in the place. My coworkers were a bit confused by the no menu concept but they quickly got the hang of things. You select your drink from either the chalkboards on the walls or by looking at what is offered in the front.

They had Dragon&#39;s Milk which is a Sarah favorite...I love my beer served in a goblet, it makes me feel classy and regal. I was sad that they ran out of 5 Rabbit right as I was ordering it. Curse you, whoever took that last bottle!

The Muddy Pig is the bomb dot com. I&#39;ve had it before and surprised my friends by ordering it on Friday. They were confused by the whole concept of bacon on your chocolatey yum, but they each gobbled up a couple of pieces so I think they were pleasantly surprised. 

It was so busy on this last visit that I couldn&#39;t even get to the board games! But they do have some fun games to play. Good company + Bacon, Chocolate and Craft beers + a chill relaxed environment = a great Friday night."

The bartenders are very knowledgeable and can give good options if you tell them what you like or just want to know a little bit more about what you are drinking.  You can tell that most of them enjoy craft beers and enjoy (as much as you can enjoy work) being there.  They have some food options, but I honestly have never tried anything there.

Love, right? YES.

And now I have even more reason to love Bigby&#39;s - though craft beer vs. craft food has always been their deliberate focus, they now offer Belgian-style mussels (replete with an Allagash White broth and shallots) and a chili kissed by Young&#39;s Double Chocolate Stout on Sundays.

Amazing Service
Amazing Selection 
and
Amazing Crowd

The main reason I went out that far is because &#34;Yelp&#39;s on Tap!&#34; had it listed. Normally I don&#39;t take a long drive 40+ miles to grab a beer or 3 but, this place got so many rave reviews that I had to check it out. 

The place has a nice &#34;Home Bar&#34; feel, and you can immediately spot the lucky people that are considered Regulars. Everyone is very friendly and quick to chat you up. The bartenders are knowledgeable on each local brew which changes weekly. I must say, I&#39;m a fan of the IPA selections. 

I ordered the Hawaiian Pizza - it was amazing! The ham to pineapple ratio was perfect. The crust was very flavorful and had a phenomenal crunch and texture. I asked for a to-go box, barely used it though. It was THAT good. I really should have gotten a second pizza to-go.

The patio area is where we smokers have refuge, it&#39;s well lit, has nice clean outdoor tables. If you let the bar tender know you plan on sitting outside they WILL come out and check on you, you&#39;re not forgotten or ignored. 

In the corner I spied board games like Jenga and what I thought was Pictionary. I&#39;m sure if it wasn&#39;t Trivia Night (Wednesday) those would have been used to their full potential and fun would be had by all!

I had 3 beers, and a pizza total bill was just over $25 - not bad at all!

I will definitely be going back to Bigby&#39;s"

I have been hearing about this place for what seems like forever, and I finally got off of my lazy butt and went. I fell in love the minute I walked in. It&#39;s a small place (I hear it gets crowded on the weekends), with a small beer garden outside. The decor is very eclectic and perfect for someone with a short attention span - there is something to look at everywhere! They also have board games, a few TV&#39;s, and some guitars laying around. Someone told me they host trivia night as well.

First off, when you walk in, their menu is on the wall...as in a wall of beers. They do have a chalk board with their beers on tap and wine selection, but my favorite has to be the beer wall. There are beers on a lazy susan that they do not have at the time, but you can vote to bring them back by putting in a glass pebble in the beer of your choice! How cool! That&#39;s something I&#39;ve never seen before. The customers choose the menu!

I ordered the Hitachino White Ale, and it was awesome. Kind of like a Blue Moon, only without the orange. The staff definitely knows their beers! There&#39;s something for everyone here, and they will help you find it! Not sure what to get? Have them surprise you or recommend something. Still not sure? Ask for a sample! I was really impressed with their knowledge!

As for the food, it&#39;s not just your typical bar food here. Their soft pretzels with cheese spread are just as amazing as I thought they would be, along with their flat breads.

After an amazing Yelp Elite event, I stopped by here with some fellow Yelpers to check it out, get a drink, and play a game. It was definitely crowded. We barely had room to move around and stood for a half hour before some people left, leaving a table empty near the piano. We quickly grabbed the table and hung out, playing a game. Games + friends + beer = my kind of night.

I am very surprised that a unique spot like this exists in the mundane suburbs. It&#39;s something I&#39;d expect to find in Wicker Park (Chicago), not Addison, IL. Couches, dim lighting, indie crowd (mixed in with some non-indie people), a wall of board games, a piano, a small bar, and endless signs and decor.

I&#39;m in love with their &#39;menu&#39;: a large display of empty beer and wine bottles at the entrance. The separation of beer and wine (beer stuff on the left, wine on the right) was cute. Because I was so overwhelmed with all the beer choices (it takes a long time for me to make a decision), I didn&#39;t know where to start and ended up ordering The Poet. I&#39;ve seen it before and wanted to try it (I&#39;m a huge fan of Edgar Allan Poe and it caught my eye) but I didn&#39;t pay attention to what kind of beer it was until I got it -- dark and heavy, not my style. I should have tried the banana bread beer. Maybe next time, if I&#39;m willing to make the drive out again and deal with the crowd.

I want to give this place four and a half stars, actually. The beer is expensive (one beer can be the price of an entire six-pack at the store), and the parking lot is really small. We ended up parking near some houses in the neighborhood. But, since 4.5 stars isn&#39;t an option, it gets five. You got lucky this time, Bigby&#39;s."

I love that even though you may not be too knowledgeable about craft beer, if you want to try something new, just let one of the knowledgeable servers know your likes and tastes and they will have some suggestions for you.

The food is super tasty, just enough light bites to keep one satisfied.  The spicy bacon flatbread pizza is phenomenal--there&#39;s Siracha in the sauce!  The other flatbread pizza I recently tried had a yummy chorizo.

We were able to get a seat at the bar no problem.  The bartenders were very friendly and happy to explain the menu to us.  It seemed to be a bit of a regulars spot.

We each ordered personal pizzas that were tasty.  

Great selection of beers &amp; ciders."

This place is tucked off to the side with little visibility, so if it wasn&#39;t for my buddy, I would have never found this place. 
This is the place to go for the true beer &amp; wine snobs. They have a large variety of beers to choose from both on tap and bottled. The cool thing about this place is that the beer is chosen by the people! When you walk in you are able to take a marble and put it into a beer you would like them to carry. There is a similar process when a keg is tapped. The place itself though is very small and becomes very crowded quickly, so try to go during off-peak hours or expect to wait. 
The food is super simple but very well done. The pizzas are cooked to perfection every time and the flavor profiles are unique. What I really appreciate is the staff. Everyone is very friendly and extremely knowledgeable. 
A good tip, if you are newer to trying crafts and are not sure what type of brew your pallet enjoys ask for tasters. No one wants to order a $10 beer and not enjoy it. 
I am excited to see these guys are expanding and adding new locations. Hopefully there will be one much closer to me."

I take my wife to Bigby&#39;s all the time. We have two beers or two glasses of wine and we are yet to be let down. I took my German father to Bigby&#39;s and he loved the Weiss bier they had on tap. It&#39;s a great spot. Figure two people will spend $30-$40 for a couple of drinks and an appetizer.

Enjoy!&#39;n"

We must have been here on an off night or must not be the normal customers. The other reviews sounded like they were describing a different experience with their servers. We walked in on a Thursday evening and were not greeted or welcomed for quite a while. We were unclear about what the beer selection was and how things worked. Eventually we walked to a table and someone greeted us. (Later we saw people greeted and given a &#34;tour&#34; right when they walked in.) We asked questions about the beer bottles that were on display when you walk in and she told us that one section is what is currently available. They also have a list of beers on tap/draft that is on a chalkboard on the wall. 

I&#39;m a novice beer drinker and wanted to learn a little more. All the reviews described this as a place where they enjoy engaging in conversation, teaching you about the different beers and helping you select something you would like. I felt like our server was not interested in describing things to us and I felt like I was annoying even though I tried to be brief and friendly. The rest of the time just felt a little uncomfortable and awkward which was disappointing to me since we had been looking forward to this for a long time and I wanted my family to have a good experience. She didn&#39;t come back and ask us how we liked what we were drinking which also seemed surprising.

I ended up having the Blanche de Bruxelles beer which I did really like. My dad enjoyed the Zombie Dust and my husband had the bottled Breckenridge Vanilla Port which he liked and then the Sixpoint 3 Beans which he did not love. 

We ordered the pretzels which we thought were excellent- they came with a cream cheese-ish beer flavored sauce. We also had the Hawaiian Pizza which was delicious. We had to try the Muddy Pig which I thought would be my favorite but it was very messy and just not as good as I had hoped, though it&#39;s unique, looked great and it&#39;s fun to be able to say we tried it. 

The bar itself is cool and quirky as others have described. The shelves with bottles and the bottlecap walls are neat and the board games are a nice touch. 

I&#39;m glad everyone else loves this place so much and I will definitely tell others about it who I think would like it, but I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s not the place for me."

Imagine my surprise when I went to Bigby&#39;s and realized Candice G had NOT YET reviewed the place! Oh joy! Until I found out she had actually worked there. Darn...once again, I am the bride&#39;s maid rather than the bride.

So be it.

Feel like you are in a universe filled with Bud, Bud Light, and Miller? Sick of the mass produced, watered down, shy little beers that seem to be multiplying like tribbles?

Come to Bigby&#39;s. Wear jeans, wear a flannel shirt. Wear a t-shirt, whatever. Come thirsty, curious, and hungry and leave full of good beer, great knowledge imparted by a terrific staff, and a full tummy from the good eats they have. Also, if you can catch some live music there, even better.

Gene-splice your favorite independent coffee shop with your favorite micro-brew tasting room with a college apartment living room and you have Bigby&#39;s.

There is an aquarium, couches, and board games. I have been two times to this place. The first time actually had live music which destroyed the atmosphere by being too loud (as live music would do in a small establishment) and the second time we had a server that didn&#39;t have &#34;service with a smile.&#34; We sat at a table to hang out and play a board game and only had 5 beers between the three of us while we were playing. Since we were pretty cheap even though it was a Tuesday and needed to get up in the morning, the server seemed to scowl as we gave the check. 

Regardless, the beer and wine selection is top notch. For being a Tuesday night this last time, the place was pretty full of people with a diverse crowd. I would definitely go to this place again since it is somewhere nice and quiet to hang out with friends."

It was an elite event when we first met and Bigby&#39;s had me at Craft Beer. Now, it may be small but we all now size doesn&#39;t count. ;) They carry a HUGE selection of beer and unique ones on tap based on their voting system (See Candice G.&#39;s awesomes explanation). 

Both times I&#39;ve been there, I have found beers that I&#39;ve fallen in love with. Most recently, the Pumpkin Ale. It has an a great seasonal flavor. This is something I would never buy in the store but because of the showcasing and their reputation, I&#39;m willing to try every beer on that wall! 

Now another thing that they&#39;re great at is making their spicy bacon pizza!! It is Amazing!!! Perfect amount of spiciness and cheesiness.  I also tried the s&#39;more pizza....eh, not my thing but surely someone else&#39;s. 

The owners and staff are fabulous! They truly put the customer first. No one is ever unattended. Great pick for a birthday venue Jelena!"

I have been wanting to stop by this place since I started a new job in Schaumburg one year ago and it is on my commute home, however everlasting construction on Lake Street has kept me away.  To mark my one year anniversary, I said &#39;eff it&#39; and decided to check it out last Friday.  

It was about a twenty minute drive from Schaumburg in rush hour traffic, which wasn&#39;t bad, but it took another twenty, twenty-five minutes to get off the ramp and onto Lake Street.  I&#39;m hoping that the guys doing this work in Addison get their stuff in gear and get this project finished soon, because I can&#39;t wait to go back to Bigby&#39;s.  

If you look around at other reviews, they might tell you that Bigby&#39;s is a little hard to find, but they clearly have a sign on the side of their building as well as one in front by the road that they share with the restaurant that they share the building with.  It was not hard to find at all.  

When I finally got there through all of the lousy road construction, about an hour after I left work, I feared that I would be too late to get a good spot at the bar and would be left standing around awkwardly.  Those fears were squashed when I walked in to find ample seating at the bar and around the room.  

I grabbed a seat at the bar and ordered a brew, Bigby&#39;s Rye P.A., a pale ale brewed for Bigby&#39;s by Two Brothers Brewing Company in Warrenville.  I have been a fan of 2Bros for several years, and while I am not a huge fan of rye in my brew, it was not very over powering in this one and did not disappoint.  I had been keeping an eye on another selection on their Beer Menus page all week, but their taps rotate frequently, and that one was gone.  

As I sipped on my selection, I couldn&#39;t stop looking at the décor:  a giant chalk board beer menu on the wall, growlers lining the bar, guitars on the wall, board games, couches, a beer cap covered door, and horizontal wood boards that made the space look like a bungalow on a beach somewhere.  This is what I would like my garage to eventually look like.  There was literally so much I could not take it all in.   

While I would not be eating anything on this visit, they do serve food, and I took some time to peruse the menu.  They have some good looking bar apps, sandwiches, and pizzas.  The spicy bacon pizza really stood out to me, and I will be sure to order one on my next visit.  

Intermission:  between beers I used the restroom, which they share with the adjoining restaurant.  It was well lit and clean with smells wafting in from the Italian restaurant, Mario&#39;s

Upon returning, I promptly ordered another beer:  Surly Mild.  This one was delicious, an English style sessionable ale with dark roasted malty goodness and a toasted biscuit aroma.  But this isn&#39;t untapped, so back to Bigby&#39;s!  I had some conversation with a few people around the bar and a couple ordering beers as well.  They had been here before and were ordering small samples before they settled on a full glass, which is good to know.  The bartender was very knowledgeable and helpful and not pretentious in any way, which is also very good when you come to a place like this.  

Ultimately, this place is fantastic, and I will be returning in the future.  I agree with other reviewers when they say it is a hidden gem.  I&#39;m glad it didn&#39;t get too crowded early on and was nice and chill, but I was told that business does indeed pick up considerably as the night wears on.  I can&#39;t wait for the work on Lake Street to be done so I can return here in the future with great ease!   Prost!"

If you&#39;re a beer lover (CRAFT BEER), you&#39;d love this place.  They have tons of unique special craft beers with a fine selection of IPAs.  They also serve wine, but NO HARD LIQUOR or mainstream beers. 

It is a small place but they have a couple TVs and a big shelf full of board games. I went with a couple friends on a Saturday night and they weren&#39;t incredibly busy.  I ordered a beer fittingly called the Raging Bitch and it was super yummy.

However, our server was slow and didn&#39;t seem to really care about her job and we waited a good 20 minutes for our check and another 10 minutes for our credit cards to get swiped.  

Either way, its a really cool place if beer and wine and chilling out is your thing.  The only thing that needs improvement is the service and speed of payment."

Yelp Friends, let me tell you why:

1) Amazing patrons and Friendly staff.  What I&#39;m about to write will give you a good sense of the place......  As soon as our massive Jenga tower toppled over, all I hear is an uproarious &#34;JENGAAA!!!&#34; from literally entire bar.  And to top things off, people were so nice; tables around us helped pick up our blocks.  One person picked one up, read the block- they had rando things written on them- and screamed &#34;Social!&#34;  So, of course, the whole place drank.  Amazing.

The staff is uber friendly and treat you like friend at their own house.  Doesn&#39;t hurt that they have couches, a piano and fun knickknacks to make it feel homey.  They&#39;re also very helpful and give great recommendations.

2) Speaking of recommendations.  They have a ton of  beer and wine.... a bit overwhelming but it&#39;s all good!

3) Pizza me!  We tried their spicy bacon pizza and it was super delicious!

We got a flight of beers and two full-size for ourselves. Our server was pretty helpful and assisted us in choosing different beers for our flight; some of my friend&#39;s favorites from the last time he was there were replaced with new ones, so it was a long decision process.

All in all, it&#39;s a pretty cool place. There are regular tables as well as sofas, and you can get pretty cozy and easily spend an evening here."

Their food menu is pretty limited but they let you bring in stuff from other places.  They&#39;re right next to a restaurant but I would recommend bringing in food from somewhere else.

The location is a bit odd but the building / bar ambiance is excellent.  Its a small place but doesn&#39;t get too loud or rowdy."

Like the island on the hit TV series &#34;Lost,&#34; Bigby&#39;s is the sort of place that can only be found by those who have been there. And possibly mathematician cartographers. Unlike the Island on &#34;Lost,&#34; it is not going anywhere and it&#39;s a super inviting place to visit. It might be a little hard to find at first, but if you like beer, wine, or just a happy place to hang out, this place is a big win.

I have found that many places that serve craft beer are maybe a little like wine bars in that they can be pricey and a little pretentious, but Bigby&#39;s is wonderfully relaxing and down to earth. &#34;Want to try a great beer? Cool. Try this.&#34; It&#39;s like someone took an awesome local bar from Orange County, and dropped it, inexplicably, behind an Italian restaurant in Addison IL. It&#39;s a nice change of pace, especially if all you&#39;re used to is loud sports bars. It&#39;s cool, low key, and a great place to hang out with friends or bring a date. 

Bigby&#39;s serves some interesting wines and a wide variety of craft beers (bottle or draft) that rotates all the time- and from what I have heard, patrons help select what&#39;s next in rotation. Bartenders are smart and approachable and are great at giving suggestions that really pay off. Beer is served in an appropriate glass- sometimes really crazy glassware- for the best possible drinking experience. There is also a nice but limited menu if you want to stay for a while and you get hungry. Everything is reasonably priced.

If you&#39;re looking to get into craft beer, hang someplace nice before going to a movie, or want to go to a bar where you can talk, unwind, and enjoy some light food, I can&#39;t think of a better place that deserves your business more. Remember, you just have to find it first."

I&#39;ll admit, I didn&#39;t try anything on tap because I don&#39;t know what to try.  I had a pear cider, and damn it was good.  I also tried the spicy bacon pizza and the muddy pig (chocolate and bacon flatbread).  Both items were delicious, I would definitely order them again.  Food costs about $10-12 here, and while the menu is limited, the options available are more than sufficient.

I was impressed by the beer list though.  I may have only been able to identify names like &#34;Emmet&#39;s&#34; and &#34;Goose Island,&#34; but with 10+ available, and a wall of bottled beers, you&#39;re just inconsolable if you can&#39;t find something to suit your tastes.

This is a small and unassuming bar on the west side of Lake Street.  I don&#39;t know why I was expecting something big and classy looking.  I love the interior of this place - it&#39;s a little bit &#34;Cheers&#34; and a little bit &#34;Central Perk.&#34;  There are plenty of tables, many of which were occupied on a Tuesday night, as well as a bar with seating and a few sofas.  Sofas?!  Hell yes!  The decor is fun without being trite and cheesy, there&#39;s an aquarium alongside one table if you want to mellow out and watch the fish.  There are also two TVs if you want to catch a game. 

I wouldn&#39;t go with more than a group of 4-6 if you expect to get a table on a Friday or Saturday night.  Table seating IS limited, and I&#39;m guessing even more so on the weekends.

Cool variety of board games too, and there&#39;s a Wii.  If your friends can&#39;t keep you occupied, then something else here certainly can.

Addison is lucky to have Bigby&#39;s as a neighborhood bar.  But it&#39;s also well worth the trek from the southwest suburbs."

If there are signs on the establishment that say &#34;21 or older only&#34;, we did not see them on the way in and we could not find any on the way out. The server (could have been the owner) told us we had to leave after my 19 year old order a coke. &#34;You can&#39;t be in here&#34;... we thought it was a joke and laughed a little... but he repeated &#34;you can&#39;t be in here, you gotta be 21&#34; ...

I was meeting someone here (HE had suggested F+H or Shiraz, but thanks to my Yelp fam, saw Bigby&#39;s was a much better choice and I made the call.)  Before he arrived I planted myself at the bar and sort of tried to figure out what I was supposed to do.  Thankfully the bartender (who I later learned is the owner) explained the Bigby&#39;s Way to me.  I chose their house rye for starters.  A few other patrons nearby also made some suggestions (very top of the shelf all the way to the right) which came in handy as the night progressed.  It was nice to be in a place where people are friendly and don&#39;t make you feel less for being a n00b.

Later in the night, the owner came by again and illustrated the beer-rating system (beer bottles + marbles) to us.  Horray for interactive fun!  Now, I&#39;m not a beer connoisseur by any means, so I only recognized maybe 2 beers.  Everything I tried was delish.  My companion and I probably had 8 beers between us.  He ordered some Belgium beer which ended up being $10 of our total tab of $48. 

The atmosphere is low-key and feels like your friend&#39;s house/basement bar (complete with ugly couches with ill-fitting/sliding slip-covers).  They had some live music (a guy playing the piano/singing).  The idea is good, but it was LOUD and made it really difficult to have a conversation without being 6&#34; away from whomever you&#39;re talking with.

Unfortunately, we had kids with us and they said we had to leave.  They said they could lose their liquor license if kids were in the place.  Weird thing was that on the patio was a large group with kids.  My guess is that they really don&#39;t want kids in the place and hide behind the made up liquor law.....or they actually were violating the law when that first group showed up but when we arrived it went beyond their threshold for law breaking.

I don&#39;t even know how it happened considering I lived about 5 minutes away for the last year. No matter, as I have finally made it to the motherland and it&#39;s everything I&#39;ve ever wanted in my life.

It&#39;s a pretty small space which is definitely noticeable on a Friday night. You probably have to come somewhat early to get a table or a couch but if you don&#39;t mind standing, then you&#39;ll be fine. At the entrance are shelves of beer bottles on one side and wine bottles on the other. One side of the shelf has all the beers they have available at the moment. The other shelf has a bunch of beers that they could get. All you have to do is put a pebble in a beer bottle and depending on how full it gets means that will be the next beer they feature. It&#39;s pretty neat getting to vote for a beer because if enough people want it, you&#39;ll get it. That&#39;s customer service right there.

They also have a bunch of stuff on tap, all of which are written on a giant chalkboard across the room. The decor is neat. The walls are plastered with bottle caps, beer cases, and taps hanging over the bar. The first time I came here was on a Thursday night. One of the bartenders came over to us and explained how everything works and showed us around a little bit. I thought that was really helpful and I appreciated getting the lowdown. The beers, of course, are amazing. If you don&#39;t know what something will taste like, just ask and they&#39;ll describe it to you and compare it to something else, or bring you a sample. 

Bigby&#39;s is totally chill and void of bros and pretentious snobs. My friends and I played the board game Life while drinking beer and another time, my boyfriend and I had an intense game of Chess. What&#39;s better than drinking and playing some board games? Nothing. It&#39;s everything I want to do on a weeknight/weekend.

They don&#39;t offer much food but what they do have is great. The pizza smells delicious but I went for the muddy pig which is flatbread with chocolate and bacon. Hells yes! Just the right amount of salty and sweet. It was perfect. They also tell you which menu items go best with wine or beer, which is helpful.

I hope to make trips to Bigby&#39;s weekly because it&#39;s absolutely the perfect setting for me. Oh and it&#39;s a bar that you can actually talk to your friends in and hear them! Wins all around."

Bigby&#39;s is not quite as close as it used to be, but it&#39;s completely worth the longer drive (just make sure your driver is sober, please!).

I came back recently for an unofficial yelp gathering and was pleasantly astonished when Ed, the awesomesauce owner, knew my name. It was my third visit. In two-plus years. Apparently, saying nice things about a fantastic bar is a good way to be remembered.

On this particular visit, I quaffed two beers I had never tried before (the super-light Two Brothers Pahoehoe* and the super-dark Three Floyds Moloko), noshed on some pizzas (thanks for sharing, ladies!) and had great conversation and a great time. Ed and his staff are all over the service, remembering what you&#39;re drinking, bringing water and tasty food to keep you from falling on the floor in a craft-beer-induced blissful coma.

*Pronounced pa-hoy-hoy, not pa-ho-ho. A delightful, mildly coconutty beer named after a type of lava found at Kilauea."

We play board games and I have on occasion brought my own Cards Against Humanity game.  This place is VERY laid back with awesome bartenders and it is comfortable atmosphere.  They have a full seated bar, tall table tops, short table tops, and couches! Plus the have a huge selection of beer and wine but their food menu isn&#39;t that great.

It was a Saturday night and there were only 2 people serving the busy bar and floor but they were quick and efficient and very friendly. Both gave great suggestions and I ended up ordering a beer flight while my wife chose the wine flight. The list of beers are staggering and I simply told the bartender I was overwhelmed and would like him to choose for me after telling him my preferences. Same for my wife. We were both happy with the variety we received as well as portion.

They only have craft beer and wine so if you&#39;re looking for cheap PBR beer specials then don&#39;t bother. If you didn&#39;t know so many beers existed outside of the MIller/Anheuser Busch world and are willing to try beer that actually tastes like something then this is the spot to get your taste on. The bartender is extremely knowledgeable and friendly. Just give him a vague idea of what you like and he can whip up a sample that is sure to please you with variety within your preferences. 

After 15 minutes of sipping, we worked up the munchies so they suggested we try the melted goat cheese as a tasty nibbler that is easily shared. Melted goat cheese in marinara sauce served with bite sized wedges of toasted, seasoned pita bread sent us both to taste bud heaven. It really was the perfect combination with our drinks. I knew it was good when we finished the dish and I wanted to order another one.

Don&#39;t you hate places that play obnoxiously loud music so that you have to scream at people just to be heard? Me too and Bigby&#39;s does a fine job of keeping the volume to the perfect level so that you can still hear it above the din but it&#39;s not intrusive. Lighting is slightly dim and comfortable seating, such as couches, are available for a perfect evening of kicking back and enjoying life without some straight billed hat and Affliction shirt wearing d-bag screaming jager bombs next to you. People here are mature but not necessarily old. Just plain comfortable is the best way to explain the ambiance here.

Thanks to Cristie B. and Jelena Z. for the reviews that led me to this great find! I&#39;ll be making a trip back here as often as possible."

Ambience:  The moment you walk in, you see a wall of beers on the left, and wall of wines on the right.  These are for you, the customer!  How it works is that you take the pebbles in front of you and drop them in the bottles to help them determine what to bring onto their menu... so whether it&#39;s something you want to try, or something you know you love... Bigby is trying to make it a place you would love to hang out in more.  The decor is very laid back, and a perfect place for a 3rd date on, or to catch the game on one of their many TV&#39;s.  Board games galore, some with &#34;extra&#34; instructions (have you ever played drinking Candyland?) , a cool place to hang out!

Drinks:  Lots of choices in terms of beer and wine.  Seriously, the selection is HUGE for such a small bar.  Very cool.

Food:  We focused on flatbreads and different pizzas, and they were all pretty tasty!  The key ones that I would suggest are:
1.  Spicy bacon pizza.  Bacon of course, but the sriracha played nicely with the ingredients and surprisingly served as a great base!  My wife doesn&#39;t like sriracha, and still loved this pizza.  Worth trying!

2.  Prosciutto asiago flat bread.  It was quite tasty.

3.  SAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT!  The Muddy Pig is spectacular and worth saving room for... a flat bread with crisped bacon and chocolate sounds strange, but the sweet and salty combination is exquisite.  I would go back, just for this dish.  Seriously.

4.  Hawaiian pizza:  Strangely enough, they do something with the hawaiian pizza here that really makes it work... was it the beers I was drinking?  I don&#39;t think so, but it may have been.  


Verdict:  Great atmosphere, great food, and more drinks than you can shake a stick at... I&#39;m definitely a fan!  Two things that will keep me coming back are the Muddy Pig and the Spicy Bacon Pizza."

I loved everything about Bigby&#39;s!  I am not a bar girl, but even while sitting at the bar, it doesn&#39;t feel like a bar. I guess that&#39;s because it&#39;s a &#39;pour house&#39;. I wasn&#39;t guessing there would be much of a difference, but things are heightened across the board here. Everything I look at when I visit a business was elevated to another level here and it&#39;s not your average &#39;anything&#39; when you walk in the door. 

Service. Stellar. Ed is the host with the most. Even when the place was hopping at 9pm, he kept up with it like a pro. And he&#39;s so personable that you can&#39;t help but want to give him your business. He&#39;s addictive. :-)

Cleanliness. Even the bathroom (shared with Mario&#39;s) is kept neat &amp; tidy. 

Atmosphere. Early in the evening, it was very low key with only a handful of guests. Before I knew it, it was wall to wall with adults sipping on a tasty beverages and socializing. No stumbling drunks here. We played cards at the bar and had a blast!

Food and drinks. Not only am I not a bar girl, but I am also not a beer girl. I sipped on Vander Mill&#39;s Apple Blueberry Cider beer throughout the night. It was right up my alley. It was the perfect suggestion for a girl like me. Spicy Pig...Muddy Pug:  don&#39;t pass up either. That would be foolish and you would regret it. Share a Spicy Pig. Don&#39;t hesitate to order a Muddy Pig alone later. Eat a couple slices there while it&#39;s hot. Then, refrigerate the leftovers when you get home and eat the rest for breakfast the following day...cold. It was fantastic first and second time around!

So that&#39;s it for now. If your friends want to meet at Bigby&#39;s, you should go. Actually, call them now and be the hero...you invite them. They&#39;ll thank you. Then you can thank me."

These people aren&#39;t pouring craft beer because it&#39;s the next big thing, or because it makes them money, or because craft beer drinkers are infinitely cooler than winos (which we are).  It&#39;s because they love craft beer, and anyone else who does should go here.

It has an awesome, casual, vintage feel without feeling like an antique store.  Lots of comfortable couches and chairs, plenty of tables (large and small), and plenty of barside seating.  The beer selection is totally top notch, both on draft and in bottles.  They have exclusive beer from Two Bros. as well as almost any Midwest brew you&#39;re looking for.

The staff is super knowledgeable and just as friendly, keeping the brews coming even when it&#39;s packed.  The food is perfect bar fare, small plates and flatbreads that are delicious.  If I were to open a craft beer bar, it would look, feel, and taste just like Bigby&#39;s."

The bar is actually a little hard to see off the main street (no big illuminated sign indicating the awesomeness that lies inside the bar).  Once you get in, there are shelves with beer bottles showing what is on tap and available by the bottle - all craft beers.

The food is also awesome - I split two different flat breads with a dining mate and my biggest piece of advice is this: GET THE MUDDY PIG. Flatbread, nutella, crispy bacon, chocolate sauce, powdered sugar - need I say more?

The bartenders are friendly without being annoying, and have good beer suggestions.  The atmosphere of the entire bar is relaxed and welcoming, and a bit quirky.

With that, of course, you need a bartender who is knowledgeable, and at Bigby&#39;s that&#39;s absolutely the case, he knows his stuff.

So don&#39;t let the outside fool you, because it&#39;s deceptively plain, and make sure to stop in for some drinks. I wish I lived a little closer to Addison, because I&#39;d be at Bigby&#39;s much more often."

The #1 thing I like about this place is they&#39;re really customer focused, from the voting for beers with marbles in the front entrance to the board games and Wii it&#39;s clear they want you to come in, have a seat with friends, enjoy some good beer, and eat some fresh food.  You get the feeling that customer suggestions here are really implemented, and that keeps things fresh and exciting.  

This place obviously caters to those that love craft beer and HOPS, however on our recent trip to BigBy&#39;s our friend was not so much into them, Ed (the owner) explained a few different styles of beers and offered several samples  to our friend who ultimately was sold on Hobgoblin and proceeded to order a few more.  Point being you don&#39;t have to be a beer snob to enjoy this place, however respect for a quality product has to be observed by all whom enter.   Places like this are good for the craft beer industry and hopefully we converted our friend from the standard beers that the vast majority of the population drinks.  

While I don&#39;t think they have a functional website they do update their menu on a website (http://www.beermenus.com/places/1196-bigby-s-pour-house).  

As for food they have access to Mario&#39;s deli so that means fresh ingredients!  The style of food is defiantly small plate oriented which works perfect for a place like this.  They have a few different Pizza&#39;s and flatbreads which I can only comment on 1 the &#34;Latin Lovers&#34; Pizza which is actually a chorizo pizza with cilantro.  It really paired well with the beers!  

Overall BigBy&#39;s is in 7 words, Best Awesome Beer Bar in the Burbs!"

You know why America is great? Because &#39;merica has REAL women. Real women drink full-bodied beer and don&#39;t worry about the calories. Real women also eat an entire Cheese Platter (with minimal help from two of their guy friends). And this real woman has found the place that will most likely ruin her 5K career. 

Bigby&#39;s, you&#39;re gonna make me fat again. But at least I&#39;ll go out in style and die a death by deliciousness.

The first time I came here I don&#39;t think they were open. The outside made it seem very much like an upscale French or Italian-inspired wine bar. My date and I decided to go somewhere else. Suburban watering holes with craft beer and good wine selections are notoriously overpriced. The tasteful patio and limited signage makes it seem like one of those boutiques with only 10 items in the store and you just *know* each item is going to cost your entire paycheck. I&#39;m glad the Suburban Beer Appreciation Society challenged my preconceived notion and gave me an excuse to see what Bigby&#39;s is all about.

In the true spirit of America, Bigby&#39;s is all about Democracy. Not only do they showcase American beers and highlight some good European ones, but they support the local breweries and serve only the finest examples of what our great country has to offer. God bless the Midwest Grain Belt! And it&#39;s all a numbers game for the 312, 630, 847 and everyone else. Don&#39;t believe me? They have a voting system in place for future beer offerings. You drop a pebble into your favorite bottle or something you want to try and they tally up the stones to figure out what they will order next. It&#39;s as easy as beer 101, Two Brothers, 3 Floyds.

I started the night out with a Daisy Cutter Pale Ale by Half Acre. It was a little bitter with a flowery aroma. Then I tried Two Brothers&#39; Ebel Weiss. I liked them well enough, but the Pere Jacques by Goose Island (lovingly called Prairie Jocks by Mike N. and I) really stood out. It reminded me of my beloved Sam Adams&#39; Cranberry Lambic, only all grown up and filled out. The best way I can describe it is as a very sweet and strong first sip and a smooth banana-berry finish.

Feeling very adult with my new found love of local libations and liberty and justice for all, I decided to go hard or go home with an entire Cheese Platter. The thing was massive and well worth the $11. The Brie was the only cheese on there I was on the fence about, but I loved everything else from the crackers to the apple and green grape garnishes. I know I&#39;ve received maybe 1/4 of what they dished out at other wine bars for the same price.

So do it. Go to Bigby&#39;s. Live large. Do not count the calories. Just say yes. Say yes to deliciousness and all that is holy in a world filled with Cheese Whiz and Bud Lite. Vote for real beer and fine wines. Support a local gem and Democracy. Don&#39;t let the terrorists win!"

If you&#39;ve never been there before, I recommend visiting during an off time so that the staff can explain the system they have going in the vestibule. I was confused by which beers were available and which were just on display and ended up feeling kind of stupid by asking for beers they didn&#39;t actually serve. They were really nice about it, though, and it wasn&#39;t really a big deal.

So while I loved everything about how cute Bigby&#39;s interior is set-up, the long list of craft beers and lovely wine selection I can&#39;t help but be slightly miffed at ZERO liquor selection.

There are so many beers to choose from!  Even if you aren&#39;t a die-hard beer fan, the crew can usually recommend one that you&#39;ll find delicious.  I tried an apricot and a pear beer this trip.  Both had the fruit essence, but weren&#39;t overly sweet.  I only wish I could remember what they were called.

We tried 2 pizzas...the Spicy Bacon and the Latin Lovers.  Both were so good, I could barely get enough.  The Spicy bacon was my favorite, but I&#39;d do the Latin Lovers (complete with delicious chorizo) any day of the week!

There are boardgames available to play while you drink and munch on pizza.  Love it!

Shortly after coming here for my birthday, I had to bring another friend here because I knew she would love it.  She did!  Now, she&#39;s been back a couple times herself.

The food was delicious! I&#39;m not entirely sure if the food menu changes with the beer menu? We had a 4 cheese pizza with an olive oil and garlic base. Yum! I&#39;m dying for the chocolate covered bacon flatbread. I had no room left last night. 

They have a nice size bar, tables, couches, games and a great mix of people. I think the banana bread beer may be calling my name this weekend at some point.

I visited this location today with my boyfriend;he LOVES Italian beef! I&#39;m not a Midwest native and I don&#39;t see the thrill,but I like to search Yelp for recommendations of things that he likes. 

I tasted it,it was cool once I had a full bite with the beef,bread,cheese sauce,peppers,and a small dip. I DON&#39;T like WET sandwiches- maybe that&#39;s a Midwest thing,but I&#39;d order it DRY with cheese,peppers,and dip on the side.Boyfriend said its an 8 out of 10.He ordered the sausage and beef and a large fry. NO ONE needs a large fry,the small is enough,but he is Greedy AF!!! The sausage and beef was $9, with the large fry and taxes the total was $13 ish.. He said it was worth it...sandwich was heavy so....

I do like that the fries were fresh unlike the overcooked fries at the other location that I visited,Im always trying to feed him based on my Yelp bookmarks and reviews,he said that I finally got it right hahaha!!!"

It&#39;s a typical Chicago-style hot dog/burger/Italian beef/gyros hole in the wall.  Everything&#39;s decent and reliable, but unspectacular.  

I&#39;ve had the hot dogs, gyros, beef, and burgers and they&#39;re all tasty enough for a typical lunch.  

Regarding their hot dogs, of particular note is that like Gene&#39;s &amp; Jude&#39;s theirs are served &#34;Maxwell Style&#34; - that&#39;s mustard, onions, relish, and sport peppers without the pickle spear and tomatoes that are usually found on Chicago-style hot dogs.   That differs from the majority of hot dog stands in the area which include the pickle and tomatoes.  If the pickle and tomatoes make your hot dog and you can&#39;t enjoy one without them, don&#39;t come here!  

The Italian beef sandwiches are nice sized with a good amount of beef on the bread.  The beef is pretty lean and I never hit any gristle or bad pieces.  The gravy is about average in terms of flavor and spiciness.  It&#39;s decent, but not my favorite since I prefer Italian beefs on the spicier side like those at Buona and Teddy&#39;s Red Hots.

Maxwell&#39;s is more expensive than most at $6.59 for their beef sandwiches.  Adding cheese and peppers will take you over $7.    

Their fries are fresh-cut and served in generous amounts.  I think they&#39;re pretty good, although they are fried a bit darker than I prefer.    

Like many hot dog joints, the staff are rough around the edges and not usually oozing friendliness.  They are mostly interested in getting you your food ASAP with grim determination.  If you are really sensitive and come to Maxwell&#39;s, you&#39;ll have to thicken up your skin and accept that you&#39;re not getting a big hug and kiss.  :)  

On a final note, I&#39;d like to give the owner credit for being mindful of the community and participating in fundraising for local kids&#39; activities.  That is much appreciated!"

They don&#39;t have the biggest menu in the world. After 6 years, I still havent eaten everything on the menu. Some places make food that is great. Maxwell&#39;s simply makes food right. When you take high quality fresh ingredients and prepare it as if the recipe was handed down through generations you end up with Maxwell&#39;s. 

The highlights:
- burgers... are huge and full of flavor (order a triple bacon cheeseburger with everything for a challenge)
- chicken nuggets... are super juicy white meat. Served with an order of fries
- bbq sauce... this comes with the nuggets but deserves a mention of its own. It&#39;s a secret house blend. I&#39;ve been pestering them for years to share the recipe.
- gyros... might be a little pricey, but the flavor, fresh tomato &amp; onion, and homemade cucumber sauce is worth every penny
- Italian ice... just try it. Try every flavor. Trust me.
- Italian beef... is on par with my great great grandma&#39;s recipe. Impressive to say the least.
- the fries... eat them fresh for the best experience. They&#39;re amazing, but can get soggy on the trip home.

The two guys that own the place are awesome. They might seem quiet, but if you can get them talking it&#39;ll be hard to get them to stop. They are much friendlier than you&#39;d expect at first glance."

Probably the best Italian Ice I have ever eaten. The strawberry is great, so even if you usually only get lemon do yourself a favor and try the strawberry.

All in all, the meal was okay.  Here&#39;s what we tried:

Italian Beef  Texture was perfect, beef is nice and tender, the bread is soaked just right... the issue here is that the beef just doesn&#39;t have great flavor.  It&#39;s missing a certain amount beefiness and richness that I expected.

Polish:  Nice snap, good flavor, great bite.  The polish isn&#39;t overly fried, but quite tasty.

Cheese fries:  This is the clear winner of the joint so far... the fries are freshly fried and delicious when they&#39;re hot.  Salted up nicely, we could eat these all day.

Verdict:  I was definitely surprised when the two sandwiches and cheese fries rang up to $14... I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever paid that much in the city.  It&#39;s tasty, not phenomenal, and a nice option in the burbs.  We&#39;ll be back to try the cheeseburgers, dogs, italian ice, and other items on future cheat days!"

After we purchased two cheeseburgers and two beefs, my dad saw the Polish hanging out on the grill.  His eyes widened as big as the solar system.  So, we walked away with 2 burgers/2 beefs/1 Polish/1 Fry to take back home. 

I was convinced we couldn&#39;t possibly finish all of this food (me, my dad, and my step-mom).  I was wrong!  Each one was more delicious than the next.  This was by far one of the best Polish I&#39;ve had since living on the South side of Chicago!  The cheeseburger was so tasty and the beef was super fresh.

I dove into a Maxwell Melt. Its a hamburger patty served with grilled onions, cheese and mustard on a sour dough bread. Delicious! The melted blend of meat and cheese is what screams &#34;Welcome to Chicago&#34;.

By the way Maxwell&#39;s makes their own homemade BBQ sauce. When you order Chicken Nuggets it comes with it. Ask for a second sauce because it goes great with frozen pizza. Plan ahead is what I am saying :)

If you enjoy lazy Sundays like me their Beef by the pound special is only $12.99. 1 pound beef, 1 fresh loaf of bread, and 1 quart italian ice."

Following that, I was on a no-chew diet for another 4 long miserable weeks. You could say I was feeling a little deprived, surviving off of Ensure milkshakes, and pureed soups!As soon as I was given the all clear to start a soft-chew diet, we made a b-line for Maxwells Beef!

To meet the requirements of my soft-chew diet, I ordered the Italian Beef sandwich, and had them dunk it so it was super, SUPER soft. It literally fell apart in my mouth! I about died and went to heaven after that meal! My soft chew diet lasted several months, and I think we ended up at Maxwells every few weeks so I could get my beef fix!

Since then, we&#39;ve also gone back for the gyros which, in my opinion, are phenomenal! Their fries are pretty darn tasty too. If you&#39;re looking to satisfy your beef/hot dog/burger/gyros craving, look no further. You wont&#39; be disappointed!"

Maybe because it was late in the day the employees weren&#39;t in the mood, but it would have been nice for one of them to smile at least once when serving a customer.

The first thing to note is that Maxwell&#39;s Beef appears to be unrelated to a place with a similar menu also called Maxwell&#39;s, in this case Maxwell&#39;s Red Hots which is just a short trip further East down 63rd street.

The hot dog I received from Maxwell&#39;s beef came on a classic Chicago style poppy seed bun. The bun I received was fortunately soft with no signs of dryness. The pickle included on this hot dog was a bit of a problem, it was the same size as the dog if not slightly larger. This created a first bite that tasted far more like I was eating a pickle sandwich with a hot dog on it than the other way around. This is particularly unfortunate as Maxwell&#39;s beef uses the better textured natural casing skin Chicago style hot dogs. The sport pepper included was hotter than most but not too hot. The celery salt was very visibly applied and I had no qualms with the quality or application of onions, mustard or relish.

The fries included were of the fresh cut variety and were decent though perhaps not the best type of fries to be complimenting a hot dog.

One other slight note about this place is that have a seemingly home made arcade cabinet playing old Namco video games, I found that to be kind of unique.

Overall the hot dog at Maxwell&#39;s beef isn&#39;t the best I&#39;ve found around, but also to its credit it&#39;s far from the worst. On one hand I was very pleased to find another place serving natural casing Chicago style dogs as it seems like 80% of hot dog stands use the skinless.  On the other hand, the pickle spear included on this hot dog was just too thick and a bit more sour than most, its flavor overpowered the rest of hot dog and after the first bite I had to take the pickle off to finish it. Even if you cut the pickle in half here, it would still be too thick. If they used a pickle slice or simply a thinner slice of pickle this would have been a four star dog. I&#39;d consider coming back here to try an Italian Beef or burger but I&#39;d probably pass on trying the dog here a second time."

Totally different and much tastier than frozen fast food fries.... try them with cheese for a real treat.

If you order your dog &#34;Maxwell style&#34;, you get the proper Chicago style sport peppers. Delicious!

Their burgers and dogs are particularly good on a hot day with an ice cold beer... available from the nearby grocery store.

Maxwell&#39;s doesn&#39;t have much inside seating available, but I&#39;d wager the vast majority of their business is take out. Weather permitting there is a small amount of seating outdoors."

They just have tough competition with Portillos Italian Beef and Hot Dogs, and also Buona Beef. Otherwise they would probably be rated higher.

It&#39;s a nice change of pace though. I still rank Portilos #1, then Buona, then this place, but I haven&#39;t tried that many Beef places in the area outside of these places.

The atmosphere is much more mom and pop and not franchisy like the bigger places. It would be fun to stop here with a group of friends or just to change it up now and then. It&#39;s a very small place so if you are weird about hole in the wall places, take the food to go. I personally like those kind of places so I will stop here again sometime.

Burgers &amp; melts= measter (between monster and beast). Nice and juicy. Always hot. A triple cheese will costs $5.45 plus tax. I kept my double cheese somewhat simple-  pickle, ketchup, grilled onions &amp; mustard. Tastes good to me!!! Burgers start at $3.05. 

The beef&#39;s are a bit underrated. While there are some big boys of beef, they can hold their own.

The Polish sausage is HUGE!!!! I don&#39;t think many with normal appetites could finish it. If you think I&#39;m kidding, go check out their Facebook page and see what I mean (http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=159982004028229&amp;set=a.157979857561777.40842.157975007562262&amp;type=1&amp;theater). 

It&#39;s been a while since I had the chili but from what I recall, so I&#39;ll revisit that soon. 

For the dollars value, this is one of the better values in that area. It seems and tastes that everything is prepared fresh versus being frozen. Next time, I&#39;ll try the chili. I hear the Italian ice is also good. Inside is a tight fit so eat outside or take it with you. Food is prepared pretty quickly. The crew (I think it maxed at 4 or 5) are very polite!!! Another keeper. I couldn&#39;t find anything I didn&#39;t like about this place."

The food here doesn&#39;t seem to be frozen as everything was of great quality for a greasy food stand.  

I can&#39;t decide on which I liked more, the cheeseburger or beef.  The fries here aren&#39;t your everyday fries as they had a stronger potato presence then those crinkle cut &#34;Ore-Ida&#34; fries that all the joints seem to use and it tasted as if it was cut that very day.  

I also liked the prices, which there&#39;s a menu on one of the pic choices on this page.  I got some lemon ice by the quart, there wasn&#39;t a price for it on the menu but I&#39;d reckon it had to of been around $4-5.

Plus the fries are made just the way I like them, with some of the skin still on and nicely salted.  Make sure you get a side of their homemade barbecue sauce to dip your fries in.  Hey it&#39;s even great on their burgers.

They have solid cheeseburgers, which are even better with some grilled onions and bacon.  If you&#39;re feeling meaty, go for the double cheeseburger, which is a beefy punch to the face.  I can&#39;t even imagine ordering a triple.  That would definitely put me in a meat coma.

On Sundays you can get what they call a &#34;Sunday Special&#34; which is a loaf of french bread, a giant cup of italian ice and a container of beef (to be cooked at home) to go. It makes our whole place smell great and our friends love us.

One recent afternoon, I came in for lunch and had a very reasonably priced combo meal with a personal sized deep dish pizza that was plenty for one person. The Caesar&#39;s salad alone filled me up.  However, I felt that the pizza was not hot enough because the cheese seemed to be stiff and therefore, didn&#39;t mingle with the other ingredients.  I could feel the grainy texture of the cheese which was unexpected; it had the consistency of string cheese and was not melted and gooey like I am used to.  Maybe West Coast versions of this pizza are different?  

The service was good and I was in and out of there fairly quickly.  However, I was also disappointed in being seated along the side of a narrow entry way to the larger dining room.  I traveled all the way from California and this was the spot I decided on to finally try some authentic Chicago style pizza so it would have been nice to sit somewhere that had more atmosphere.

We called around to a few pizza places and found most of them closed for NYE, but we lucked out when Giordano&#39;s told us they were open.

When we got there, there was a short wait but we were seated very quickly.  We ordered some beers and decided on a pizza to share.  I admit, I had never tried a real deep dish pizza before, and I was basically picturing a sauce soup.  I was pleasantly surprised to find out that cheese soup would have been a much more accurate description.  A large pizza here does not have a very large diameter like I am used to, but the depth was just incredible.  I ate one slice and went from starving to completely stuffed in the shortest time span I can remember that ever happening.  I don&#39;t remember the specific toppings; I think there were peppers and some meat, but it doesn&#39;t really matter because the amount of cheese just overwhelmed everything else.  I loved it.  The next morning I had a second slice for breakfast and was good for most of the rest of the day.

Overall, I&#39;m happy I don&#39;t live in Chicago because I would not be able to resist that pizza and my arteries would be rocks by the time I turn 30.  In all seriousness, this restaurant was great and I&#39;d love to come back after trying a few more area deep dish pizzas to compare."

I have recommended this one to many of my friends who have all enjoyed it. I am giving only 2 stars to this one because of multiple reasons. I went in with my friends on a Saturday evening. They closed the doors 15 minutes before closing time. Another weekend i went again. Wait times were 20 mins even though I could see plenty of free seats. They say it takes 40 mins to bake deep dish pizza which I know due to my past experiences at other locations. Problem was I ordered veggie deep dish pizza and it was dripping with water coming out of boiled vegetables. You can&#39;t beat the cheese the pizza sauce and cheese but water made the overall experience bad. Plus our friend ordered Margarita Pizza which was the worst he had ever eaten. I think this place needs to keep up high standards setup by Chicago locations.

The Naperville locations are the best by far. However, make sure you put your name in and go to the bar (near the entrance) to get a drink and start thinking about your order, especially during rush hours. Also this is where we typically knock out the most important parts. Meaning, getting our drinks, debating on what we should order and leaving the rest of our dinner to good conversations. Actally, this would be a great time to try the Mag Mile Margarita that&#39;s one of the best. They also have a full bar, good selection of beers and the wine is house that made in the vines of California.  

Lastly, coming from a Commercial Insurance Underwriter background, I love how they have an open kitchen area (which you&#39;ll pass on your way to being seated) that shows you how the kitchen looks, how you&#39;re food is being made and a good insight if things are clean or not. This is something you typically don&#39;t see with other restaurants and that can be scary. Oh, don&#39;t forget the mints on your way out!"

It was a Monday evening not crowded at all. They have small bar. We were immediately greeted and seated as we walked in.  I signed up for the newsletter before going (Thanks Yelp) and received a email for free cheesy garlic bread. It was delicious!
We ordered the deep dish with pepperoni. The 35 minute wait was tortuous! When it finally came out I was expecting it to be piping hot but it wasn&#39;t. Perhaps they let it cool for a minute which I didn&#39;t mind because I would have still eaten it and burned my mouth. It was 2 of us bs we ordered the small which was more than enough. We both left feeling like we should have had those last 2 bites."

This is our go to location for both take out and dine in. The sausage and cheese is always a favorite, though you can&#39;t go wrong with any of their deep dish pizzas. The house salad is excellent, made better by the dressing and fennel. Surprisingly, the thin crust pizza is also pretty good. The only knock is that for take out orders, they always seem to miss something with my order. Not a huge deal, but it would be nice to just go in and pick up food vs waiting an extra 10 min waiting for something that was forgotten from the original order. Nevertheless, will not deter me from coming back."

When our order came out the pizza accidentally had onions rather than mushrooms. We brought this to the attention of our server and she apologized and brought over the manager. The manager was extremely apologetic as well and told us they could place a new order for us (30-45 min wait time on deep dish) or they would be happy to take the entire cost of the pizza off the bill if we wanted to keep the one that was already made. Pizza was still delicious and the management displayed excellent customer service for the error on their part. 

I give them 5 stars rather than 4 because although the order was now correct they handled the situation that best suited to customer. They have won my return business!"

Each of us USED to enjoy their pizza.  Last night was our last trip, no doubt about it.  My family of five were the only diners when we came in at 5pm.  We ordered two deep dish pizzas, a house salad and sodas. That was $85. Let me repeat..with light tip that was $85!  Giordano&#39;s idea of an extra large pizza is what the world considers a small. The second problem was our deep dish. Their idea of a deep dish here has flattened out.  Add Giordano&#39;s to that list of restaurants that have skimmed their meal size down to a fraction of it&#39;s former size and jacked up the prices.  A few years ago they were still deep dish, now their deep dish looks like a glorified thin.   Lastly, when our pizzas were served they came out room temperate.  Again, we were the only diners in there at the time, yet they couldn&#39;t cook two pizza&#39;s properly. I usually eat 3-4 slices, last night I had to force down one, and hated it.  
I know it&#39;s popular to love this place and everyone thinks it&#39;s iconic for Chicago.  I represent those that think and judge appropriately, and will honestly tell you that this restaurant just lost our business for good.  They&#39;ve skimmed their product, jacked up their prices and lost their understanding of how to cook a pizza.  Pathetic."

I think the thin crust pizza is great, but have had soggy crust issues once or twice.  The extra layer of crust on the deep dish is a nice touch.  My favorite is spaghetti and meatballs.  Most of the time, delivery is within an hour but call early on weekends if you don&#39;t want to wait 90 minutes."

My favorite Chicago pizza is Lou Malnati&#39;s. My husband had been to Giordano&#39;s before and enjoyed it so I decided to try it. Service was pretty good. The staff, from the hostess, to the manager and servers, weren&#39;t very friendly. We ordered the boneless wings, traditional wings, house salad and a classic Chicago style deep dish pizza. The wings were amazing. Great portion size, crispy on the outside, yet juicy meat inside, and came drenched in the sauces! The salad was average...It&#39;s always disappointing to find brown limp pieces of lettuce in your salad. My biggest disappointment was the pizza, which was the whole reason we chose to dine at Giordano&#39;s. When it came it it wasn&#39;t even hot. The outside was pretty warm but the inside of the pizza was wasn&#39;t hot at all. The cheese and toppings inside were a lukewarm congealed mess. Besides the temperature, the entire pizza was very under seasoned and packed flavor. Cooking 101, season, season, season. It was so mediocre that I didn&#39;t even finish one slice. Will definitely stick to Lou Malnati&#39;s from now on when we are in Chicago."

I gave them three chances but now I&#39;m going to a different pizza place. Today was the last straw. I ordered 2 pizzas and a 2L of Pepsi. After 1.5hrs kid pulls up with a green V6 Mustang. Called me because couldn&#39;t find the address which isn&#39;t the issue. Pulls out one pizza and smiles and says &#34;I forgot the 2L&#34;. I&#39;m like where&#39;s the other pizza? &#34;Ummmm&#34;. Not only do I always have to repeat myself on the phone I have to repeat myself in person. He gives me the ONE pizza and asks me to sign for charges. Are you kidding me? Like &#34;I don&#39;t have 2/3 of your order but here sign this and fuck off.&#34; Since I had guests over I didn&#39;t make a big deal of it and asked him to get the manager to call me. You guessed it, no one called me. When I called the place back 15 minutes later they didn&#39;t even know any of this happened. I had to ask to speak to the manager just to find out he does not even care. They all just want you to shut up and wait. I don&#39;t care how busy a Saturday gets. 3 hours for 2 pizzas is straight stupid. I didn&#39;t even make a big deal, I asked him when we can get the rest of our stuff and he said he&#39;ll try to get it here in 25 minutes. Note we live 5 minutes away. After about 50 minutes our soggy ass deep dish gets here. I felt bad not tipping the second driver but this was ridiculous. Never again.

I love both the thin and stuffed pizza here, we usually get a small size of each which leaves plenty to take home for leftovers.  
The thin pizza has a buttery cracker crust flavor with a smooth tomato sauce and a milky, creamy mozzarella cheese topping.  It tastes great.  It&#39;s not really that thin though, it&#39;s more like what most places call &#39;hand-tossed&#39;.
The stuffed pizza is also excellent, it has a similar crust and cheese flavor as the thin, but with a more garlicky, Italian herb seasoning flavor in the tomato sauce. It&#39;s pretty filling so don&#39;t expect to eat much more than a slice or two.

As an appetizer, the cheese garlic bread used to be a favorite of mine, but unfortunately around 2013 they changed the recipe to a three-cheese topping which I think now has an unpleasant aftertaste and is no longer worth ordering.

The decor is this location is nice with many framed poster prints reflecting historic Chicago themes such as the Columbian Exposition or Chicagofest."

Anyway my major complaint is that the pizza was burnt. Seriously how do restaurants send out a burnt pizza. Never ever again. I&#39;m sticking to my favorite. Palermos in Oak Lawn on 95TH and Ciereo.

Giordano&#39;s was my first Chicago pizza and will be the benchmark of all Chicago pizzas I have from this day forward.

It was delicious.

The sauce was rich and with just the right amount of heft to it, tomato pieces visible, while not being an unpleasant texture. The cheese was thick under that, oozing out the sides after each cut. The crust was cooked to perfection and not too thick.

The pepperoni was meh and would have taken this to four stars but the service was outstanding so I&#39;m going to give them a pass. I just feel like the pizza needed a little more pepperoni to compete with the generous portions of cheese and sauce.

The server was friendly, extremely informative, and helpful. He split the bill for the table, even splitting the pizza between us. I&#39;ve never had a place do that for me before on separate checks.

I was very impressed and highly suggest Giordano&#39;s if you&#39;re in the area. Apparently they deliver nationwide, so maybe try it even if you&#39;re NOT in the area!"

I went to Giordano&#39;s this past week, but I&#39;ve had it dozens of times in the past.  It&#39;s reliable and never lets you down.

Because each slice is so filling and filled with cheese, you do not need to order a lot.  In addition, don&#39;t go over-the-top with extra ingredients.  Keep it simple.  Go with just cheese or cheese and sausage or cheese and spinach.

The alfredo was divine goodness, smooth and buttery, with a generous portion of perfectly cooked shrimp. The ravioli was cooked to perfection with a very nice tomato sauce on top. Both pastas came with two generous baked garlic rolls. The pizza was killer - crispy, flaky crust and fresh ingredients, smothered in tomatoes and melted cheese. Thank you Giordano&#39;s for a fantastic lunch that left us all very satisfied and happy!"

As for the bad, I feel as though you get shortchanged when it comes to toppings. I honestly wouldn&#39;t pay extra for them. The drinks are pretty expensive and they are mostly ice, so I would absolutely stay away from those and save your money!"

We LOVE their stuffed pizza .  Thin crust, in my opinion, is better than Lou&#39;s. Don&#39;t get me wrong, we love Lou Malnati&#39;s, too, but Giordano&#39;s thin is better.  Both G and D are awesome in their own way, but we love all the cheese on Giordano&#39;s, the pepperoni and the sauce.  

Parking in this location is tough!  We would go pick up our pies.  One of us would drop the other off in front to run in and get them, drive around the block a few times and pick them up.  Be prepared for your stuffed pizza to take 45 minutes to cook.  We have eaten inside the restaurant.  It&#39;s very nice.  Good service.  Remember to look for coupons just to help bring the cost down.

Since moving from Naperville to MN, it&#39;s really now just hitting me how much I loved this pizza.  Chain pizza places just can&#39;t stand up to the ingredients, freshness and made-to-order. Oh my, I could just cry.  I miss it THAT much.  It IS expensive, but you&#39;ll be hard pressed to find better-unless you&#39;re in New York.

First off the manager (short blonde hair, maybe in her 50&#39;s) didn&#39;t even say hello when she greeted my sister and I. She said what do you want? I told her I didn&#39;t have a large budget and was looking to do appetizers because it would be 3 o&#39;clock in the afternoon, I figured this would be fine for my guests. She said that&#39;s not what people do for baptisms. She said they host baptisms all the time and they serve pizza. I asked for a price list. She said I could pay for 25 people to guarantee a private room or else, if a larger party came along, they would get the private room. Wow! Really??? Did not hear that I didn&#39;t have a large budget? So, pay for 5 more people? That&#39;s absurd!  And then to say, although I&#39;m the 1st to request a party for that day, if someone else comes along they would have first dibs? That&#39;s poor business!! I will never return. Not everyone in Naperville has a large budget. Not to get too personal, but my child, the one having the baptism, has special needs and a lot of medical issues. That&#39;s where I need to focus my money. I just wanted a few hours away from my home, to do something special and not spend a lot of money. I went to your competitor and they accommodated my budget. You get 1 star because Yelp says I HAVE to give you at least 1."

We stop by Friday (February 20th) the food and service (the guy who was our waiter was great) was awesome. We decided to go back Sunday (February 21st), we ordered our food plus and to go order which was &#34;The Special&#34; pizza. Throughout our meal she never asked us how our food was and we had to ask her a few times for refills Her attitude was short and dry, despite that we still enjoyed our food, it&#39;s not every day we get Giordano&#39;s we are from Georgia. We never complained... When she brought the order out, I looked in the box and noticed that it was Spinach Pizza rather than The Special Pizza. When inquiring about it to her, she insisted several times that we told her Spinach Pizza and that is what we ordered! I politely told her that we did not order a Spinach Pizza and that we ordered The Special. She finally said that we could get another pizza but we would have to wait and are we sure that&#39;s what we want. I told her yes we would wait. At that point she never apologized or anything, acted as though it was our fault.  When she went to tell the cook about the mix up, we could hear her complaining. We got up and told her to cancel the order. As a customer we should not have been able to hear her conversation, better yet she should have just put the order in and that&#39;s it.  As we were leaving the restaurant one of the cooks offered us the spinach pizza but we declined because we don&#39;t eat spinach pizza (that was nice of him to at least ask). Than the waitress said sorry for the mix up (in a rude way), which was TOTALLY not convincing at all....We were leaving the restaurant we could hear her talking to the other workers about the situation.  We ended up going to another Giordano&#39;s (Route 59) in Naperville to get the pizza. Sadly she missed out on a good tip and business."

We ordered several pizza for a big group including pepperoni and spinah tomato...both were sooo good.  Each pizza feeds about 4-5 people if everyone has a couple slices.

Both of these iconic Chicago pizzas are great and it&#39;s really tough to choose which one of them is better. In my opinion, both of them are winners in their own way. Lou Malnati&#39;s if you like a nice buttery flavor and a strong aroma from your ingredients and Giordano&#39;s if you like your pizza a little wetter, fresher tasting, and lighter. I wouldn&#39;t mind having either one any day of the week and my special stuffed crust pizza and tropic delight pizza I had on my last trip were both excellent. This was complemented by a very addictive cheese garlic tomato bread as an appetizer. I&#39;ve gone to several Giordano&#39;s locations now and the food never disappoints."

I have had dozens of stuffed spinach pizzas from this Giordanos over the years.  The last one had sauce that was markedly different and was saturated with garlic.  I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s happened, but for a $30 pizza, you&#39;d better hit the mark.

I suggested Giordano&#39;s down the block as an alternative.  Turned out to be a good decision.

We were seated immediately with no wait at all, and the service was great.  The deep dish is good, but it&#39;s definitely not God-tier like Lou&#39;s.  Like if Lou&#39;s pizza was a 10, Giordano&#39;s would be her 7.5 friend that you would only go home with because that 10 shot you down.  Still quite doable, but only because it&#39;s the next best thing at that particular moment.

The sauce and cheese of the pizza are great, but Lou&#39;s destroys them in the crust and sausage department.  Lou&#39;s has that corn meal, olive oily quality to their crust.  Giordano&#39;s has more of your standard doughy flour crust.  Also, Giordano&#39;s disperses their sausage in little balls versus Malnati&#39;s entire solid layer of sausage.  Like I said, the pizza is good enough, but it&#39;s not fork-and-knife awesome.

This Giordano&#39;s is a great location with great food and service.  Good pizza, but without that wow factor that Lou&#39;s induces.  I&#39;m sure Giordano&#39;s deep dish passes as Chicago-style in Texas or Minnesota, but when I have friends visiting from out of town, I send &#39;em Lou&#39;s way to get a real taste of this city."

The manager is rude and unaccommodating! Do not go here if you have allergies!  We ate at this Giordanos location a year or two ago and they were able to find something for my 8 year old son to eat that did not have dairy in it. This time, this manager didn&#39;t want to help us find anything, except the gluten free pizza.  (As we all know eating gluten free is not the same as eating dairy free.). So I asked if the marinara sauce has Parmesan cheese in it. He told me, &#34;I&#39;d assume so&#34;.  I asked if he could check the label and he told me everything comes prepackaged and they had thrown out all the labels. They did not have an allergy book either.

I got to the restaurant at just the right time, it was 5:55 on a Friday night and the place wasn&#39;t packed yet but was quickly filling up.  By the time we left there was what looked like a pretty decent wait, so we were glad to get there when we did.

We were promptly seated, there were four adults plus my 7mo old nephew.  We got a table in the back and had a decent amount of space to spread out and found a place to put the car seat that was out of the way.  Our waitress took our drink and food order at the same time... it&#39;s Giordanos, you know we are going to order deep-dish pizza.  Order is placed and both my sister and brother-in-law enjoyed salads before the pizza.  The salads both looked sizable and good, it wasn&#39;t a skimpy salad so that was a nice benefit.  The large deep-dish pizza arrives and we all dig in, two delicious pieces per adult and the pizza was finished!

The waitress we had was great.  She was quick to refill our drinks and check on us frequently during the visit; it was a great experience for all of us.

Giordano&#39;s is the best deep dish pizza I have ever had, far superior to pretty much all other options. Gino&#39;s East is bird food compared to Giordano&#39;s, and that&#39;s the truth, Ruth.

A major feather in the Giordano&#39;s cap is that every location seems to be pretty consistent. I&#39;ve probably had pizza at five different locations over the years, and have never been disappointed. This location in Naperville is no exception, as the atmosphere was good, the waitress was attentive and friendly, and the pizza was just as excellent as always. This time we had the tropic-something-or-whatever pizza, which is Canadian bacon and pineapple-- I&#39;m pretty nuts about pineapple pizza.

It is also conveniently located in downtown Naperville, with a free public parking lot right across the street. It&#39;s nice not to have to find a parking garage, as all of the previous Giordano&#39;s locations I had hit up (aside from the ones in the far out suburbs) seemed to require me to park blocks away, or find public transportation to get there.

Ordered half jalapenos and pepperoni half sausage. Both were decently good, I might have been slightly disappointed because I was expecting to have my mind blown at the goodness of this pizza. It was a pretty big pizza and we ended up taking a couple slices home.

Lo and behold, my mind was blown the next day. Giordano&#39;s pizza has to be the BEST TASTING reheated pizza I have ever had.

We did have an option to pre-order our pizza once we got there and put our name down, but we weren&#39;t in some huge hurry or looking to shorten our time out.

As we arrived back,we were seated and easily ordered. We started with the Spinach Artichoke dip, which luckily wasn&#39;t served with chips, but instead came with little slices of garlic toast, which were a much better pairing and it made it way easier to scarf down. We ordered a small deep dish that didn&#39;t take too long to get there and was brought out in good accordance to the time we finished our appetizer. The service was really good as well and for it being a busy Saturday night, everything was expedient. I was bummed that one of the only times I went to order a drink while I was out, was the one time that the restaurant was out of tonic. Oh well, I suppose I saved myself seven bucks.

I read in a previous review that they didn&#39;t have pineapple, however, I actually got excited the other night because they did have it. I really wanted it on half of my pizza, but decided to get sausage instead. At this point in time I could totally down some pineapple stuffed crust...Here&#39;s to next time!"

Another very good local pizza place. Like most other places, chances are very good you may not need to order anything else. If you do get them, appetizers I would suggest are mozzarella sticks, breaded zucchini, breaded Mushrooms. The garlic &amp; cheesy breads are also very good. Chicken wings &amp; strips are also solid but might be overkill unless you&#39;re in a large group. The staff are also very friendly people also. Now if you don&#39;t know this, I will tell you now. Expect the wait to be between 30-40 minutes (carry out or dine in; check their Internet site and they make it pretty clear). 

If you go the route of pasta, I suggest the lasagna (very hearty especially in the fall and winter) or the fettuccini Torino (chicken in extra virgin olive oil &amp; garlic, mixed with our own red and Alfredo sauce; you may also get it with shrimp). All the pasta dishes are fantastic so you can&#39;t go wrong in my opinion. As far as sandwiches go, I don&#39;t eat them often because I want pizza or pasta when I come here. If you do, go with the meatball or the chicken Parmesan. Now as it relates to salads, go with the antipasto salad (ham, Genoa salami, Provolone cheese, black olives, red onion, pepperocini peppers, cucumbers, &amp; tomatoes) or the Caprese salad (tomatoes, fresh mozzarella cheese and basil dressed with house balsamic vinaigrette- great in the summer). 

Now lets get the matter at hand, the pizza. If deep dish is too much for you, then the thin crust will work perfectly for you. The crust is very good (generally not to crispy or too gooey). Regardless what direction you decide, the sauce has a very nice flavor and the cheese is topped generous. If my mood possesses me to, I&#39;ll get the special 
(sausage, mushrooms, green peppers &amp; onions) . Not sure why I&#39;m naming the choice of topping but I will: 
I prefer: Sausage, Mushroom, Green Peppers, Onions, Black Olives, Fresh Garlic. 
I &#34;get&#34; these: *Spinach, Ground Beef, Fresh Tomatoes, Jalapeno Peppers, Green Olives. 
I don&#39;t mind: Pepperoni, Canadian Bacon 
I can&#39;t have: Anchovies, *Shrimp (allergic) 
I don&#39;t &#34;get&#34; these at all: Pineapple, Broccoli (you like these, I&#39;m not mad at you but I still don&#39;t get it). 

The crust is very very good, excellent texture. Love the thick crust. If you get the large, chances are very good you&#39;re taking some home (unless you&#39;re with a large group). One thing I can say is that the flavors never over power me but yet still very rich. I have no complaints and can&#39;t recall having a bad pizza here. One of several locations in the area. If you eat it with a fork, no problem. 4 3/4 out of 5."

If you are looking for a place to host your party/shower in the downtown Naperville area that can accomodate 50+ people I would highly recommend this restaurant.  Many places we had looked into downtown Naperville could hold between 30-40 tops, so we were thrilled that Giordano&#39;s had excellent party packages.

They let us pick our arrangement of the tables and had extra sign in tables and present tables outside the party room for us.  They also had a personal server to serve the pizza at the food table.  The pizza itself was just as expected, delicious stuffed deep dish pizza with a perfect crust.  They also allowed us to bring in our own cupcakes for dessert.  

Cannot say enough great things about the service and food at this location.  Much thanks to them for a wonderful bridal shower."

I think Chicago has a lot more to offer than Giordano&#39;s.   The hype that surrounds this place makes it seem much better than it really is.

The stuffed deep dish is ok, but a little disappointing.  It seems to be more about quantity than quality.  Or maybe I&#39;m completely mistaken and this is supposed to be a cheese eating contest.

But what surprised me was the spinach and artichoke dip.  I really loved that.  I expected the garbage you get at Applebees, but this was so much better.

The wait staff is friendly and courteous, the place is clean is respectable, and kid friendly.

The pizza is of excellent quality, from the simple cheese pizza to pizzas with multiple toppings in them. The appetizers are also tasty and high quality; I enjoyed the garlic bread while waiting for my pizza. Both were outstanding, and I&#39;d definitely come back for more. 

Don&#39;t worry about the long waiting time for the pizza-Chicago style deep dish always takes awhile for all of the cheese to bake. The wait staff will be very attentive during the course of your meal. 

The pizza is a good value for your money, it&#39;s very filling, so you won&#39;t leave hungry.

The bottom line: It&#39;s a great place for authentic Chicago style pizza! You won&#39;t leave hungry, and you&#39;ll enjoy a great meal while you&#39;re here. The waiting time is good, considering the location of downtown Naperville and the type of restaurant."

If you&#39;ve never been, get the stuffed pizzas! I always get the large stuffed pepperoni, but you are free to do half and half pizzas as well!

Fast, friendly service. Their appetizer combo plate is huge and too much for just 3 people. We did our best though. It worked out perfectly because girlspawn only eats mozzarella sticks, the husband only eats fried mushrooms, and I love fried zucchini.

I&#39;ve tried the pasta, and it had very fresh tomato sauce, although it tasted very bland and spiceless to me.  

I was disappointed in the thick crust pizza here.  At Giordano&#39;s the deal breaker was the extra layer of dough they place on top of the toppings, like a true pie.  The issue with this extra layer is that it doesn&#39;t cook correctly after tomato sauce is placed on top.  My pizza crust was crispy and hot, but the top layer of dough was still stringy and spongy.  I almost wondered if I was going to get sick from eating uncooked dough.

As for service, I have a mixed review.  I waited at the bar for my table, and the bartender was fantastic- attentive and helpful.  If you are waiting for a table at the bar, you are able to pre-order your deep dish so it will hit your table sooner (just be sure not to order it TOO early, or you won&#39;t have a table to eat on).  Our table server, however, was not attentive.  My drink went empty for over half a slice of pizza.  

Overall, a decent place if you&#39;re in the area, but if I&#39;m specifically out for deep dish, I&#39;ll go elsewhere."

This one does NOT immediately dump you back onto a major road, so if your drive-through order is messed up, you don&#39;t have to stop short, leave your car with the flashers going, hope the next car in line is attentive enough not to hit you as you run inside and make them fix it (or else you&#39;re making a big ridiculous U-turn somehow out onto Ogden and back, which is nigh impossible). 

But also, I just learned yesterday of something else that makes it unique: the Coke Freestyle machine. 

This hulk of a machine instantly harkened back to the &#34;BeBop Cola&#34; episode of &#34;Sealab 2021&#34; for me, so I was a little afraid that it was going to start singing to me in an electronic voice and then begin hurling cans of Mango Reinhardt at my head.

However, this machine doesn&#39;t talk, just sits passively and waits for you to play with its touch-screen as you deliberate on what oddball combination of pop flavors you want to try.

Peach Fanta? Raspberry Coke? Vanilla Barq&#39;s root beer? No problem.

I must admit, I went for boring old Dr Pepper (they didn&#39;t even offer the vanilla or the cherry vanilla Dr Pepper flavors that you can buy in cans! C&#39;mon). My bf was more intrepid and went for the vanilla Barq&#39;s, but he thought it could have been more exciting. Next time I&#39;ll have to branch out. 

Aside from these amenities, it&#39;s your average Wendy&#39;s. The addition of the salads and tastier &#34;sea salt&#34; fries (vs. the old, thick squishy ones) are an improvement. But the draw has always been the burgers for me, though I try to rarely indulge. If you must have a slab of cow in a hurry, this is the way to go, in my book. And drop in for a lime Coke and a smile while you&#39;re at it."

We made a reservation using OpenTable, which is always a bonus in my opinion. We were seated right away at a cute corner table overlooking downtown Plainfield.

Our server was very kind and helpful and I specifically asked his name so I could mention him, but of course I can&#39;t remember it now! We were brought bread and a plate with 3 different butters. My mom started with the heirloom tomato and prosciutto starter, which she really liked. I don&#39;t eat prosciutto but I did try the burrata cheese and toast that it came with and it was very good. My friend got the cream of potato soup and loved it. 

In terms of entrees, I had the filet ordered well done with the bernaise sauce. It arrived perfectly, which doesn&#39;t always happen. The meats are wet-aged, so the waiter explained that to us which was helpful. My friend had the airplane chicken and my mom ordered the Canadian lobster tail. They both really enjoyed their entrees, as well. For sides we tried a few: the tator tots with bacon and gouda and the lobster mac &amp; cheese. Both were VERY good and different than what you usually see at these kinds of places. The mac &amp; cheese did not have a fishy taste at all, which was good. My mom also got the mushrooms, but I didn&#39;t have any. 

Portions were good and prices are reasonable for this type of food in this area. I think they just started with valet also. We were told we could park across the street in the bank lot when we went so that&#39;s what we did. Atmosphere was good and it was much larger than I expected on the inside.

Our server gave a brief history of the building (cool 1920&#39;s story &amp; vibe) &amp; recommended the crab cake appetizer &amp; it was the best we&#39;ve ever had. Ever. I had the boneless ribeye with brandy peppercorn glaze and added brandy mushrooms. Wife had the seared halibut with lobster risotto. Both were cooked to perfection &amp; delicious. Finished with key-lime dessert - so good. Everything we ordered tasted great and looked really good in its presentation as well. Definitely recommend you try The Opera House."

Very pretty restaurant but the service was horrible. Our Waitress was actually alive in the roaring 20&#39;s. Dinner for 2 with a bottle of wine was $165 and we tipped $50 and the waitress seemed upset. My old fashioned tasted like I was at Fridays. Certainly not an experienced bartender. I told her it was horrible and she didn&#39;t take it off the bill. We will continue to drive to Oak Brook for good food because Opera House failed miserably. Will not go back. Not 1 healthy choice for vegetarians.

Wonderful ambiance. My husband had the cream of onion soup &amp; ribeye with blue cheese crust and asparagus on the side. I had the beet salad, which was an appetizer but perfect size for a light meal. I enjoyed a bite of each of his items and they were delicious! I also had the Bee&#39;s Knees cocktail, which was potent but scrumptious. We shared the creme brûlée with cappuccinos and rolled out of there fat and happy! When we made our reservation we didn&#39;t think (or know) to ask for a window seat. The ones that were open when we walked in were already reserved but the hostess, Christine?, made a note in their system for the next time we called for them to reserve a window seat automatically. Great service! The building has a fun history and gorgeous remodel. The floors &amp; ceilings are all original and even have some character left from when they were once an actual Opera house &amp; apartments (i.e. outline of where a bathtub was).

We ordered 2 ribeyes and 2 filets. All 4 were perfectly cooked. The tater tot side was large enough to share. We did not care for the pork belly appetizer. For $14 it lacked flavor and the chips were soggy. We enjoyed the bread served with 3 different butters. We had higher expectations for the candy bacon. We expected a crunchy bacon, but instead it was soft with a sweet glaze poured on top. It seems like all the effort went into the steaks and the sides and apps were an after thought. We will definitely come back for the steak. The servers should know the history of the opera house. The girl we asked knew nothing. We like that it&#39;s attached to a martini bar downstairs. We went there afterwards. We recommend the martinis."

They make it incredibly easy to serve up better-than-restaurant quality Italian diinners at home.  From freshly made pastas and sauces, Italian beef, breads, to the deli and meat offerings, this place rocks.  I&#39;ve yet to try their Take and Bake offerings yet, but at this point I have confidence they are at the same level as everything else they offer.

I go here just about every weekend now.  The items that must be tried are the Zeppe&#39;s Sauce.  Their Sunday gravy for use on pasta,  Amazing.  The spicy pasta sauce is also quite good.  Think Arrabiatta.  The Italian beef with their freshly baked bread is fantastic.  Probably better than Portillos.  Might as well grab the pre-cooked sweet peppers while you&#39;re at it, or a jar of their hot giardiniera.

The pizza kit I tried was good, but didn&#39;t include oven temps.  I like the crust crispier than ours turned out.  With some tweaking, I&#39;m sure I can improve it, but our preferred local pizza joint will remain our preferred option for pizza.

Edited to add:  Tried The lobster ravioli with vodka sauce.  Simply amazing!"

Maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;m from a place with a huge Italian population and a lower cost of living than Naperville, but I thought this place was EXPENSIVE.  If you live on the north side of Naperville, this is a bit of a drive, but my husband and I decided to check it out in between running errands during a home renovation.  We wanted to get a take and bake lasagna for an easy dinner.  We ended up with a cheese tortellini 1/2 tray for almost 40$.  I guess that&#39;s the cost of convenience?  It was only ok - nothing really special and definitely not worth the cost.  It was definitely on the bland side - most of the taste came from the cheese inside the tortellini.  If the sauce had more flavor, I would have been much happier.  It was also a bit mushy from being frozen, thawed, then baked.  I would have been much better off making something myself.

If I were looking for something extremely specific for a recipe or something, I might go back... I also might go back for a cookie tray if I am going to a party or something, but I wouldn&#39;t go back for a Take and Bake thing.  If I really want to go to a great Italian grocery store with a huge selection, I&#39;ll just wait until the next time I visit my parents in Pittsburgh.

I should also stress that this place is a catering business and deli, but not really a restaurant.  I&#39;m only saying that because the &#34;survey&#34; questions Yelp is asking me makes it seem like something different."

We were hungry and wanted something not fast food to eat. Googled and found this place. I am glad we did.

It is a little hard to find if you don&#39;t know to look for it (a single storefront in a strip mall). I walked in and was promptly greeted by a young man, and he asked me if I would like help. I ordered 2 sandwiches and him and his coworker promptly got to making them. They confirmed my order and when there was a very simple and really minor mistake, they made a new one. I did look around the store and they have a nice mix of Italian grocery items, meats and desserts (the cookies and tiramisu looked so yummy). 

The prices were very reasonable ($14 out the door for 2 nicely sized sandwiches).,

When we ate them, my husband and I enjoyed them! Very fresh and homemade tasting! 

We will be back since we are in the are and a lot of credit to the owners to hiring these two guys that genuinely seem to like what they do and helping the customers. I was there for maybe 5 minutes but they put a smile on my face and I will remember them and that visit."

Zeppe&#39;s is small, Zeppe&#39;s is unique for the area. Zeppe&#39;s is a treasure! I went there with the fam on a Saturday afternoon. The staff was helpful, directing us toward the most popular selling items that they offered. We picked out some take and bake lasagna with meat sauce, some pizza sauce, and some frozen pasta. 

I am not going to lie. I loved everything. I wish i hated it all and could spare myself the pasta overload, but I can&#39;t. My butt got like 8% bigger but it&#39;s worth it. 

I want to go back and try their pasta sauces and maybe the meatballz since they were so highly recommended. 

In the meantime, I&#39;m going to do some lunges in preparation for when I eat a whole pan of lasagna by myself. Do you think 7 lunges will be enough? Ok, you are right. 10 lunges. Thanks!"

He is from New Jersey and he loves the little Italian sprinkled cookies. Today, I decided to do something special for him and stop by to grab some of the cookies as a surprise.

When I pulled up, a man was walking out of the store. I got out of my car and he kindly greeted me and asked me how I was doing and asked if I was going in the store. I thought he was just a customer leaving and was just being nice, but I soon realized that he was the owner. He told me he was just about to leave but kindly opened the store for me so I could get my cookies. I thought that was really great of him.

The store itself is pretty small, but they have all the Italian goodies you could possibly want. The walls are lined which products like pastas, sauces, etc. In the back they have a little deli where you can get cold cuts, and they also have a huge class case of cookies and other baked goods.

I bought A TON of cookies and it only came to $7! Such a great deal because these cookies are really expensive at other Italian markets. I wanted to look around more but I didn&#39;t want to keep him since I knew he was leaving. 

He was so polite and professional. Their store phone answered while I was in there picking out my cookies, and he answered it and asked them to please hold so he could finish helping me. I love that! I hate it more than anything when employees take phone calls and start helping someone else while they are dealing with me. Great customer service!

As I was checking out, he told me to bring my husband back to try this Cannoli because it&#39;s the best thing they sell. I loved the store and the cookies were delicious!! I will definitely be back."

Aside from the cannoli, I picked up some prosciutto and sopressata for a meat &amp; cheese spread for dinner.  The deli prices are a little higher than I&#39;m used to paying at Caputo&#39;s, but at Zeppe&#39;s I didn&#39;t have to wait in a long line.  While I waited at the deli, one guy suggested the olive oil breadsticks with the prosciutto.  These items ended up pairing quite well together.

There&#39;s a small deli case, three aisles of sauces, San Marzano tomatoes, Pellegrino sodas, pasta, olive oils, spices, and various items you need to prepare any Italian feast.  They also make sub sandwiches at the counter, and stock their own homemade pasta and vodka sauces. 

I&#39;m already thinking about when I&#39;ll be at Zeppe&#39;s next to try their homemade vodka sauce and chocolate covered cannoli.

The two employees working here were college-age guys, who were very friendly and knowledgeable.  They know their products and engage the customer, which is something I&#39;m not accustomed to since I usually shop the big box stores.  I could definitely get used to shopping local."

When I went in to order, I was impressed with the imported selection of grocery.  I was not, however, impressed with the woman who waited on me.  It was mid-day and she was not busy.  When I told her about my Groupon she seemed very short; almost annoyed.  I picked up the lasagna the following day and again, she was not pleasant at all.

I paid the tax and walked out...no &#34;thank you&#34;, no &#34;enjoy&#34;, no &#34;have a nice day.&#34;  

The lasagna with meat sauce was 9x13 and substantial.  It was made with fresh ingredients but terribly bland.  The noodles were gummy and the ricotta filling, sauce and meat all lacked seasoning.  We ate a few pieces and threw the rest away.  I would not recommend their homemade lasagna.  Nor will I visit the market for authentic ingredients; service with a smile is very important to me."

I always go here to get my pastry and cookie fix. If you visit, try their wedding cake cookie and their turtle cup. So rich and delicious!

I went in with high hopes due to the great reviews. Being from New York I was excited with the possibility of having a good Italian deli like we have back home. I tried it last week and was very much disappointed. I got a sub which was just not good at all. The bread was like something you would buy at the deli counter at the supermarket or worse. The whole sandwich was mediocre at best. The cannoli was good not great. I brought home some premade vodka sauce and pasta. Not very good.

Zeppes is ultra friendly and they slightly remind me of the notorious Italian deli&#39;s from Chicago. They&#39;ve got some great authentic Italian products like sweets, oils, vinegars, canned tomato goods, and the like. 

They&#39;ve got great deli meats like coppa, soppressata, prosciutto, pancetta, and fresh sausage. Not to be forgotten are their Italian cheeses, stuffed peppers, pasta sauces, homemade desserts, and fresh bread.

I never ate any of the sausage because I generally don&#39;t like Italian  sausage.  Until I tried Zeppe&#39;s freshly made sausage! A friend insisted that I take a bite and once I did, i was hooked. It is not anything like the chewy, fatty sausage you get at most retail chains. It is so finely ground and so fresh that it converted a sausage hater like me!
Where else can you get fresh filled cannoli? Zeppe&#39;s does just that. My husband&#39;s favorite.

Tiny grocer, but they got what you need.  Bread, sauces, pastas, meats, beatballs, desserts, they got it.  Plus you get the warm fuzzy feeling of shopping local.

Probably the smallest grocery store I&#39;ve seen.  Sells a little bit of everything from sauces, pastas, to various deli meats, sausages, cookies, tiramisu, &amp; Cannolis.  

I was so ecstatic when they had cannolis, which is good for when you don&#39;t feel like fighting the crowds at Caputo&#39;s.  Regular sized ones were $2.09 and the chocolate-dipped version were $2.99.  Don&#39;t be afraid to ask if you don&#39;t see one with chocolate as they are filled fresh to order to ensure higher quality.  I also got some mild sausage for about $4.49 a pound.  

It was just one lady taking care of everybody when I was there and was very nice to everybody, despite doing many things at once.

Very good cannoli by the way.  Having it filled right when you order it makes a difference.  The filling was sweet and very creamy."

When I walked into the place, I was surprised by how small of a location it was and I was fearful that this was a bad Groupon purchase, luckily it was not.  

I was immediately greeted by two young men who were happy to tell me about everything Zeppe&#39;s had to offer.  I decided to try the meatballs ($5.99/lb.) for a party I was having and told them how many people would be attending, they suggested what turned out to be the perfect amount of meatballs for the number of people at the party.  I purchase the Zeppe&#39;s marinara sauce as well.  I was also very impressed that with no notice, Italian Beef and Au Jus were available as well in a good &#39;crock pot&#39; worthy quantity, 3lbs. for $19.99 (I think).   

The meatballs were moist and delicious; I just put them in the oven at 375degrees with some of the sauce over top the meatballs, and cooked for about 25min.  My soon to be sister-in-law said I could just buy her meatballs for her wedding gift, that&#39;s how good they were haha.  I thought the Zeppe&#39;s sauce was good too, not too salty and very fresh tasting.  

For someone who doesn&#39;t like to cook much it&#39;s nice to know that there&#39;s a place that can do it for me and not be outrageously priced.  Zeppe&#39;s can be thankful that they chose to place a coupon on Groupon, since they now have a customer for life!"

We thought it was $10.00 off deli sandwiches, but it was for their take home &amp; heat meals.  That was fine because we wanted to try their lasagna too.  We ate an Italian sandwich for lunch, which was very good. We took two containers of meat lasagna home. They weigh the container to determine the price.  One was over $16.00 and the other was over $10.00 . We heated the larger package first.  Man, what a disappointment.  In the entire container there was ONE piece of meat that was half the size of a marble.  I couldn&#39;t believe it.  The only noticeable cheese was a small amount of what I think was ricotta. The sauce was not savory, but very sweet.  The other package of lasagna is in our freezer &amp; may never come out.  They do also sell a veggie lasagna, but our containers were cleared marked as meat.  The market is very clean &amp; they have a  nice display of Italian foods &amp; a nice deli, although prices are high.

Heard this place had some ridiculously good pizza and Italian specialties - so we made the trek down to Pomodoro E Mozzarella (I love the name alone) and let me tell you I may consider moving to St. Charles (or buying a helicopter to get here).

Cute little trendy spot located in a small strip mall off of North Ave.  Its more of a carry-out spot as there are only 3 or 4 small tables.  Interior is modern, clean &amp; narrow.  You can plop yourself at the limited counter seating to your left, but not much room here especially for a large group.  On a Friday night, all tables were occupied...

The extensive menu boasts an ARRAY of traditional &amp; specialty offerings. From the traditional pasta list (18 house made choices) to seafood, chicken, sandwiches, salads and unique app&#39;s and lets not forget PIZZA. The atmosphere along with the Sicilian inspired dishes left me quite impressed....its more of a café than a typical pizza joint..  

Our large group placed a large order to go:

Med Thin crust - Pomodoro Special (green pepper, sausage, mushroom &amp; onion).  
Piccola (small) Artisan Ortolana (grilled eggplant, zucchini &amp; roasted red peppers).
Piccola Artisan Gamberi (shrimp on garlic confit tomato sauce with fresh mozzarella).
Pesto Gnocchi
Penne w/meatballs and sausage in red sauce
Side of Rapini (for me).
Grilled baby octopus app (for me).

Our order was ready before we arrived (yes, that&#39;s how long it took us to get here, driving into the City is even faster). They even phoned to make sure we were on our way (very nice gesture) - we had passed it a few times.  From the nice phone girl to the workers behind the counter, everyone was professional and friendly and everything was nicely packaged and bagged.

While I thought the pizza&#39;s were wood fired, their in fact oven baked. Artisan resembles a wood fired crust. Around 10&#34; for a small.  They offer both small &amp; large sizes in Artisan only.  All smalls are $13, Large $20 with the exception of Margherita; $10 &amp; $18. 
Many traditional Italian varieties, but Shrimp is not one I see often, so I went for it.  

I tasted it all. Pesto gnocchi was a standout with a generous amount of pesto packed with flavor. Gnocchi was somewhat tender, but didn&#39;t melt in my mouth. I&#39;ve tasted some really heavy gnocchi and this was definately better than most. Penne in marinara was overcooked but both sauce &amp; meatball had great flavor. I&#39;d order the gnocchi before Penne.

I loved my side of Rapini. Very tender, very flavorful.  Sautéed with lots of chopped garlic and olive oil.  Healthy and tasty.  I would order this again in a heartbeat.  Not something I expected to see here, love that they offer this. The grilled baby octopus...ooooooohhh....they give you three nice sized octopus and I am a SUCKER for this.   Perfectly charred and tender, gently laying in balsamic &amp; oil with lemon..I was in octopus heaven. Another stand out - Loved this. You MUST try it. Screw the calamari, get this instead, well worth it.

Artisan pizza - I tasted &amp; noticed olive oil on the bottom of crust which had a softer bite vs. chewy.  The fresh mozzarella they use is excellent quality, you can taste it. Shrimp pizza was a garlicky explosion. You may not want to kiss anyone after eating this. Nice amount of shrimp not overcooked.  Ortolana is a go-to of mine, but veggies were cut to thick for this crust. Chunks of grilled red pepper, thick sliced zucchini and eggplant.  It made the middle soggy and crust couldn&#39;t hold the weight of toppings. But I loved that each veggie was perfectly grilled, tender and ultra tasty.  I had no problem finishing leftovers...  
Thin crust pizza was liked by all. I thought it was good, but would go with the Artisan again.

You won&#39;t find a better value for the quality here. Seriously. Pasta&#39;s start at $10, most expensive $12 w/seafood.  Compared to your average restaurant, that is a STEAL.  Most expensive app; Octopus $11.  Portions are enough for two. When you don&#39;t feel like making dinner, you come here for some home style cooking instead..

Pomodoro is a great find and I can see why its popular among locals.  Quality &amp; preparation is above and beyond. Sicilian owned with dishes done right. I&#39;d come back for the rapini and grilled octopus alone and maybe try an Arancini or the Sicilian specialty -  Tronchetti Di Panelli (garbanzo fritters - sound delish).  They make their own bread too.  Grab an 8&#34; pizza and soda for $4.99 during the lunch special.

St. Charles is lucky to have you Pomodoro. If your in the area searching for a great, casual, fast and affordable meal, you&#39;d be stupid not to check them out."

My girlfriend and I were visiting from chicago for the weekend and developed the taste for pizza.  We found this mom and pop spot on yelp and thought we&#39;d give&#39;em a try.

One of the best decisions of the trip.
The pizza was awesome !!!!
And let me remind you, im from the city,  on the west side.  I know pizza.

The crust is perfect, and the freshness of the ingredients really comes through. 
 
The owners were there,  and Rosalee was wonderful,  her service was amazing and made us feel like family.  We felt like we knew these people for years.

On our way out, the husband and chef of the establishment offered us a dessert. I was already stuffed, but my girl wanted to try it.  He brings to the counter a homemade cannoli.  It was nothing short of amazing,  i had to make room it. This place is a must do if in St. Charles area.
Thanx guys."

I ordered to special which is sausage, green pepper, mushroom, and onion. The pizza came out a bit charred on the edges, hot, and super delicious. I told my spouse that this pizza reminds me of my youth in the old neighborhood. Sure enough the owner lived in the same area too. You can always tell!!!!  

In addition to the pizza we ordered wings. They were great!  Naked, crispy, No breading with a side of sauces. 

This is my new go to place."

There are a few better places for Italian food but you&#39;ll easily pay double what Pomodoro charges.

This is mostly a take-out restaurant, but there is a little counter to eat at if you&#39;d like to stay and eat.

Now, good Italian food is simple and gets it&#39;s flavor from good ingredients. These guys deliver on that. The sauces are excellent and the pastas are always done perfectly - not overcooked like 90% of the places around here. 

Their pizzas are seriously fantastic.

This is definitely a place where you&#39;ll do well being a little adventurous with your order. For the love of God, quit ordering spaghetti and try something new. 

The couple that runs this place are great. Super nice people. The food isn&#39;t pretentious at all, it&#39;s honest and really good.


The best part about this is that right next door is Muscle Maker grill.... all the gym bros from XSport around the corner have been trying to get swole eating bad chicken next door and have no idea how much better they&#39;ll do if they just got some chicken and pasta after their workout.

My girlfriend and I were just passing by and she said she wanted pizza so we pulled over and ordered the Ai Spinaci, a side of meatballs and fries. With two drinks it was just over $20. While we sat and waited for the food we spoke with the owner and found out that she was originally from Sicily. After a great conversation, she brought us some of the homemade toasted ravioli and fresh bread. It&#39;s hard for me to find new adjectives to describe how absolutely amazing the food is. We both took one bite of the ravioli and just melted in our seats. The meatballs came out next and the food just got tastier and the pizza was even better.

From the delicious marinara and meat sauces to the meatballs and pizzas, you will not find a better Italian Restaurant in the area. This is not dining Italian style, it is true Italian dining. It doesn&#39;t any more authentic than this.

The staff was friendly, and the service/time to pickup was prompt. Their prices are great as well taking into consideration the free smaller pizza with purchase of a larger one. 

We didn&#39;t order the artisan style pizza which seems to have better feedback than the regular pizza. The regular pizza was good, but perhaps could have used more sauce. Overall experience was moderately impressive; Pomodoro E Mozzarella is in my top 3 or 4 pizza joints in the area. We weren&#39;t blown away like the reviews suggest, however, so I&#39;d suggest going more with the consensus and ordering the artisan. That&#39;s what we plan on doing if we order again."

Cons: so so soggy! The primary flavor was burnt and otherwise underwhelming. There was a black piece of eggplant on one of the slices (no pic, sorry). The person taking my order asked me what toppings were on the Ortolana - so I checked their online menu and read it to her!

The fried mozzarella sticks had a unique batter on them, and were delivered piping hot (something most other places manage to screw up). As recommended here on Yelp, we ordered one of the artisan pizzas, the Quattro Gusti. It was outstanding. I&#39;m not sure about some of the fuss about the crust being overcooked; it had a lovely slight char that we thought made the pizza. The ONLY reason I didn&#39;t give Pomodoro E Mozzarella five stars is because when it was delivered, the center of the pie was completely soggy, making it difficult to eat or even pick up. Perhaps the center was rolled just a little too thin, but we won&#39;t let that stop us from coming to this place again. Neither should you.  I think it was an isolated incident."

Not hot, just perfectly spiced like Italian sausage should be. The sauce is really good and the &#34;artisan crust&#34; is a must have. BUT I&#39;ve had them three times now and the pizzas are always overlooked. Too bad because flavors actually disappear when you overtook a pizza. They need to watch the clock and cut it down a couple minutes for sure! The calamari had a great texture and was very flavorful. It&#39;s fried, but not crispy. So that should be looked at as well.

The Fresca had a wonderful combination of fresh arugula offering a bitter element that is balanced by the sweetness of the asiago cheese. With the savory base quality of the prosciutto, this will be a pizza we will order on a regular basis.

I don&#39;t know how you offer such a high quality pizza at the price you do, but I hope we can all benefit from your creations. My family has been residents of Saint Charles since 1981 and in all the years we have lived here, I have never been so excited for a restaurant to open it&#39;s doors.

Hats off to Pomodoro E Mozzarella."

It was perfect. Two Artisan pizzas and Fried Ravioli! Quattro Gusti &amp; Salmone were the best we&#39;ve had.

I didn&#39;t know this place could deliver all the way to Fox Mill!  It is really a step up from pizza cucina and Taylor street, especially their artisan pizzas.  

Food- We were ordering for ten people, so we ordered quite a bit of food including cheese thin crust, sausage and spinach artisan, wings, pasta, and salad.  The thin crust cheese id say was about the same quality as pizza cucina or Taylor street, but the artisan pizza is where they really step up their game.  In my opinion they should only have the artisan pizzas on the menu because it was way better than their other kinds, and way better than a lot of other pizza in the area, especially for delivery.  We got the ai spinachi pizza with sausage, fresh mozzarella, and spinach.  The sausage was hearty and flavorful, just like Italian sausage should be.  The spinach also had great flavor and did NOT overpower the other ingredients with bitterness like spinach tends to do.  The wings were pretty good as well, but were pretty expensive for how small they were and the quantity they came in.  The pasta was a simple EVO sauce which was good but the tomatoes in the pasta were tasty and fresh.  Salad was good as well. 

Service- Delivery took about an hour as they said it would, which is good time considering we ordered three pizzas and a lot of other stuff.  They got the order completely right as well.  

I&#39;d recommend the artisan pizzas to everyone within delivery range."

The ingredients were plentiful and fresh.  I&#39;ve also tried the pan pizza which was good, but not a &#34;must have&#34; for me.  I really got creative last night and had the Chicken Piccata.  It&#39;s so hit or miss ordering something like that for delivery, but it was delicious.  I had my leftovers tonight!

I didn&#39;t think it had that great of a sauce. The crust was over cooked and very tough and chewy. When I was checking out the pictures on Yelp, the pizza appeared to be over cooked in several photos. I went only because of the glowing reviews and felt let down with the pizza.

This applies to restaurants too.  Get yourself over to this itty bitty Italian spot.  Now, let me tell you about the food.  The toasted ravioli were crunchy and with delicious creamy insides.  The fried zucchini sticks stayed firm.  I&#39;ve had them from other places where the vegetable becomes floppy and gross.  The breading was dense and seasoned.  They came with ranch and marinara.  I wish the marinara was thicker but the flavor was sweet and flavorful.  The arancini rice ball was huge.  It was also amazing.  We should have stopped there but we already ordered an eggplant parmesan sandwich and two pizzas.  The sandwich had three huge slices of eggplant and enough cheese for a small pizza.  Do you like just fried potato chips with a dusting of seasoning.  It was the type of seasoning that you would lick off first and then eat the chip.  But when your in public that sort of thing is frowned upon.  Anyway, the fresca pizza will be ordered again and again.  It had such a fresh look and perfect flavor combination that I would understand if you stopped reading and went there now. The other pizza was very good.  Ai Spinaci was the name.  The garlic in the sauce was chunky.  I love garlic so this was so welcomed.  As for the sausage I am guilty of picking off a few extra bits from the other slices.
So, are you influenced enough?  Go try it out and order me a fresca pizza while you&#39;re there.  
  And they cater.  I put that this place isn&#39;t good for groups because the place is small.  So if your party is bigger than 4, get it to go."

 Yelp steered me right here. 
Never had rice-ball appetizer before, but how tasty, glad we went with that! I&#39;d love to have one in front of me right now!

Have NO idea why it gets 2 dollar signs, it&#39;s about as affordable as it gets! 

The couple running this business are seriously charming &amp; delightful to speak with. Wife came over (as 3 of us are teachers) to chime in on education (so nice to hear support on any level). 

Being Italian I know the food well &amp; trust me, this is as good as you get back home in Italy, it&#39;s the genuine article with all fresh ingredients. 

I know they haven&#39;t much room (4 of us actually ate there. Proximity perfect; place happens to be situated between us. And yet still hr. away for each party) so how wonderful if they could expand---albeit, on other hand, one doesn&#39;t want to see them overwhelmed &amp; potentially risk lower quality! So maybe this is best!   

The absolutely ONLY slight issue is they are not suited much for dining in, so had to run to Oberweiss to use bathroom after long drive but hey, that&#39;s fine by me, got to decide what small ice cream to order afterward. 
Though honestly, we all agreed after we sat down to eat it, STUPID move!
How in the world did I NOT think Tiramisu &amp; other desserts HERE instead, was the way to go??! 
Clearly, we were NOT thinking!
Now I&#39;m dreaming of what that would&#39;ve been like instead. The desserts in Italy are decadent &amp; delicious. This place seems virtually plucked out from my two Italy-trip experiences.. 
Maybe time to go back, no matter how far!. 

Thx to the owners for the somewhat unexpected &amp; wonderful treat.
And of course to yelp posters!"

I&#39;m quite the pizza lover. The sad part is that I don&#39;t get to have it often. I live in Los Angeles. Coming from Chicago, it&#39;s hard to even bother with pizza in LA. So when I came home for the holidays and saw this new pizza place right on the corner, I was super intrigued. I had to try it. And boy did I try it- 3 times in 2 weeks. I&#39;ve tried their thin, artisan, stuffed, pan, chicken parm, and arancini. MY GOD, YOU GUYS. This is the real deal. The dough tastes fresh. The tomatoes in their marinara and pizza sauce is unlike any other pizza joint. The spaghetti was homemade. Why go to any other pizza place and get frozen stuff just warmed up when you can go to this amazing place?!

If you haven&#39;t tried arancini (also referred to as &#34;rice balls&#34; - an underwhelming description), you are in for a treat. Think of a ball of soft, moist arborio rice (about the size of a baseball) filled with a thick, cheesy, tomato-based, meat ragu. The entire ball is breaded and deep-fried. Served with a side of tomato sauce. Delicious is not a strong enough word. 

Originally, arancini were made with day-old risotto - not a bad way to make use of your leftovers! The point is - you would expect to find seasoned rice with plenty of cheese. Pomodoro has found a way to keep their rice moist and wonderful without adding the calories/fat from additional cheese. The ragu center is equally creamy (you&#39;ll find a little cheese in there). They are fried to a perfect, crispy golden brown. 

Ok - can you tell I&#39;m an arancini nut to begin with? I&#39;ve made a few thousand from my own Sicilian family recipe. Pomodoro E Mozorella comes as close as anyone ever has to my grandmother&#39;s arancini.

Yet we hadn&#39;t tried this relatively new place in St. Charles. So we did.

We ordered a medium cheese for the 2 kids (and OK, for us a bit too) and then a &#34;Fresca Artisan Style&#34; pizza (a &#34;no red sauce&#34; style pizza) for the adults.

 We all agreed when enjoyed them both. The bit hit for us adults was definitely the Fresca pizza we ordered. I absolutely loved the crisp crust and the fresh toppings. That pizza was gone within a few minutes.

Then we stole a piece or two of the cheese pizza... it was.. good. The crust wasn&#39;t nearly as crispy as the Fresca pizza we ate. It was loaded with cheese... the kids loved it.. but it was almost too much. As some has stated it&#39;s very greasy, but hey that&#39;s what lots of cheese does when baked.

We&#39;d order here from again and definitely try more of their &#34;Artisan Style&#34; pizzas.

We did pick up so I can&#39;t comment on the conditions of the pizzas with delivery, but when I picked them up they had just come out of the oven. 

3 stars for the cheese and 4.5 for the Fresca, so 4 stars it is!"

The toppings were fresh and plentiful. The prices were better for what you get from any of the chain places. I ordered cheese, pepperoni and fresh basil.

Since it was my first time, I decided to order the lunch special, an 8 inch personal pizza and a can of soda for $4.99. No, you are reading it right, a pizza and a soda lunch combo for only $4.99! I ordered a basic sausage pizza with fresh basil. Initially, I wasn&#39;t expecting much for two reasons. One, there was only one other couple dinning during my visit and, two, other than their selection of Sicilian style artisan pizzas, they offered some of the most common &#34;Italian&#34; selections one would find or expect to find in just about any other mom-and-pop pizza joint. However, when I saw chef and owner, Joe, reached in a rectangular tube and out came a ball of dough, one you can see is very fresh is just right, I knew I just ordered something special. I was right! As a fan of just about everything pasta or pasta related, one bite of my pizza told me Joe took the effort to craft perfectly al dente bites for his customers. For me, the dough makes the pie and everything else completes the master piece. I was in heaven! The sauce was just right. The topping were all very fresh, especially the fresh basil. To top my experience off, I had a most wonderful conversation with owners Joe and Rosalinda (two of the most beautiful people anyone could ever meet). I felt more like a guest at their home instead of dinning in a restaurant. I am hooked! I will have to try one of their artisan pizzas the next visit. It is really too bad that this place does not have the best location. Joe and Rosalinda&#39;s place isn&#39;t an everyday mom-a-pop joint. They should be a gourmet restaurant. My only complain? The price of their pizza lunch special is too low. They need to seriously think about raising it another $2 or so. People will pay for the value because the pie alone is worth the extra $2. Go! Go to Pomodoro E Mozzarella!"

The beef flavor and texture are always comparable...it&#39;s the juice that counts! It just depends what you like.

I like the robust herb juice flavor that willingly supports the beef. I like the charred sweet peppers and crusty fresh bread that brings it all together.

Food -2.5-
Meatball sandwich was very good
Bud was cold and chilled glass 
Pinot was good
Rustica pizza was absolutely horrible- the crust was so hard and the whole thing was incredibly dry.
The menu says baked in less than 5 minutes. I would have preferred to wait then to have a pre baked crust.

Service -1-
The manager waited on me.
Not terribly friendly.
He watched as I juggled a bottle of beer,
A chilled glass, a glass of wine and a plastic number while trying to put away my credit card and receipt. I asked for a tray but maybe he didn&#39;t hear me?
Decor and cleanliness - 4 -the remodel is very nice. The staff was busy cleaning.

The current marketing is offensive.
Graduation catering:
Something like &#34;you can&#39;t eat a diploma&#34;

Growing up on great Italian beef in every nook and cranny of Chicago.. all I can say about the beefs themselves from Buona is that they are &#34;sorta buona&#34;. They are ok, not as good as Portillo&#39;s (which are overrated, but tasty) but reliable and satisfying. 

Their fries are hit and miss mediocre. This day my french fries were not hot and tasted old, I was driving away with my hand in the bag when I discovered this... On a good day they are ok fries.

I stop at this shop because it&#39;s convenient to work and home and I don&#39;t generally have to deal with crowds.

One of the things that I really like about Buona is that they post their nutritional info online, a beef is not so bad if you are counting calories and need a splurge. I&#39;m currently in the non-calorie counting continuous splurge mode... which will then lead back to my appreciation of the nutritional information being available. Just saying."

This is a very good fast food restaurant that has retained its family ownership and surpassed its rivals down the street.

The menu includes the usual (Italian beef) and other sandwiches (panini&#39;s).  In addition, they have good salads, and individual pizzas baked fresh.

Their Italian beef used to be comparable to Portillo&#39;s down the street, but since the selling of Portillo&#39;s to a venture capital firm, Buona&#39;s sandwich is far superior, both in quality and portion size.

Buona also wins on their drink station (you can walk up and get free refills yourself vs. engage with customer service at the meal pickup counter as is the case with Portillo&#39;s).

A nice plus is that after ordering at the counter, for dine-in you have a seat and they bring the food to you on plates with silverware vs. bagged takeout and plastic forks/knives as is the case with Portillo&#39;s.

This store was remodeled within the last couple of years for an updated dining area."

Everything was fresh and delicious but didn&#39;t quite measure up to Portillo&#39;s. There was a little less meat and a slightly smaller portion of sweet peppers.  Other than that, I can&#39;t really put my finger on the differences but suspect that the impression of inferiority is likely driven by the flavor profile being a little more subdued.  

As a side note, the Buona brownie was nowhere compared to the Portillo&#39;s chocolate cake.  That alone actually made me regret my choice but geography had a lot to do with the decision.

One thing about native Chicagoans and beef sandwiches is that we all have our favorites but the others will usually do in a pinch.  I supposed that sums up my experience with Buona..."

Not the best Italian beef around, but I mean it&#39;s pretty good for the price you pay. I don&#39;t suggest getting the lunch special, if you do the math, you get less food for a dollar more. How that makes sense? No clue.

Good staff, friendly guy that asked if we had menu questions and if we needed anything after we got our food. Stay their long enough and they&#39;ll even offer to throw away your food for you. Cashier didn&#39;t know what she was doing though. 

You can dine outside which is definitely nice, especially in this messed up Illinois weather we have. I got the Italian beef and I still believe that it is an outrage that they charge you 40 cents for peppers and cheese. Like that&#39;s just crazy. Really delicious though."

I still really like both the Italian beef sandwich and the burger, and really don&#39;t see a need to venture into their menu beyond that.

I would say that the prices here are pretty reasonable and it&#39;s a nice place to eat with good food. On the other hand, Buona Beef as a company has some of the worst customer service that I have encountered. This location in Naperville is actually one of the better ones and I haven&#39;t experienced many problems here, but a few of the other locations are poorly run. At least the food is always consistently good."

Their food taste great, but i always go to the drive-thru, and when you get the wrong food, or not as described, or they forget to pack all items of your order, or they screw a special request (after repeating it to you correctly) .... and most of the time you dont realize these issues until you get home/back to work/to your picnic..... well you get the point, I&#39;m tired of giving them 2nd, 3rd, 8th, 15th chances !!!

One of my biggest pet peeves is the misleading change to their menu.  Actually it is FALSE ADVERTISING !!  I use to go here a couple time a week &amp; always ordered Polo Pomodoro or the Chicken Artichoke successfully. Great bread, veggies &amp; yummy thick slices of grilled chicken breast.  Sounds great, right ??  

It was until they started substituting deli-style slices of chicken breast - without informing the customer !! It is false advertising because their drive-up menu board, in store menu boards, and website all DESCRIBE &amp; show a PICTURE of said sandwich with the THICK CUT SLICED grilled chicken breast.

So that is what I am ordering &amp; EXPECTING !!  I have even called the Manager &amp; he said &#34;sorry&#34; but it&#39;s a temporary change &amp; didnt really care when i explained that the taste is different as is the texture &amp; I would have no complaint if i was informed so I could choose a different item.  He said I could come back to get something else (on my dime) but i said No because i was already sitting @ a park 15 mins. away.  After the 1st problem with the change I called ahead &amp; was told it was back to the original chicken breast.  Nope,... after i drove 7 miles specifically for the sandwiches, i confirmed when ordering, think all is great, then get 2 sandwiches with DELI SLICED chicken !!

I give up !!"

I won&#39;t say who I think is but I&#39;ll put together a list and you can decide for yourselves. Again, like my Portillo&#39;s review, this is aimed towards out of towners and those new to the area. 

Some refreshers from a prior post- some lingo that may help you: 
DRY: Very little gravy 
WET: We splash a bit of gravy on the sandwich 
JUICY: sandwich dipped in gravy (sometimes not fully submerged). 
Combo: Italian Beef &amp; Sausage 

I could almost cut &amp; paste my Portillo&#39;s review here &amp; for the most part, it would stick. Here are some key differences between the two:
1.  Hot Giadinera doesn&#39;t have the same bite but still a nice flavor, favoring olive versus peppers. It&#39;s STILL very good. There is a mild giadinera

2. Buona has 3 options of beef&#39;s to choose from: Piccolo (5 inch), Original (7 inch), &amp; Maggiore (9 inch). 

3. I hope I&#39;m putting this right but Buona is almost like a very good Italian deli. They now (and have for some time) served pizza (thin crust, closer to neopolitan-style (go with the 4 cheese &amp; add sausage or buy the supremo &amp; call it a day).

4. They serve hot &amp; cold sandwiches (roast beef served on a pretzel role is very good). Ever tried their Parmesan Chips? Give them a try &amp; see if you like them (I do. I wish they sold them in stores). 

5. Where most places offer a jumbo dog, Buona does a double dog (2 smaller hot dogs in one bun). For me, that&#39;s a bit odd and I haven&#39;t liked it.  They also have excellent burgers as well. They offer BBQ like Portillo&#39;s, but I don&#39;t go to either spot for BBQ. I have Buona&#39;s BBQ one and it was good. 

Very effecient location during lunch time. A good place to eat. I guess I should consider eating off the beef menu."

Even though it was technically past the lunch rush, the place was still busy. There were some menus laid out in the entry area when you walk in (ostensibly for catering, but they have most everything that&#39;s on the regular menu); if you&#39;re unfamiliar with Buona&#39;s offerings, it&#39;s a good idea to do your pondering here, as the menu board inside has no descriptions (though a few of the items are displayed freshly made for you to see...kind of like the plastic sushi concept, but, you know, not fake). 

I ordered the 5&#34; Buona beef sandwich with mozzarella added (this is the smallest size; there are two larger options as well) with parmesan chips and a drink. This is one of those places where you order at the counter and they bring it to your table. You do get your own drink though, and the drink bar is unfortunately positioned at the end of the ordering counter, so there is some confusion with the patrons crowding to get their beverages and the staff trying to get out to bring the food. 

The Buona beef sandwich was okay, not the best Italian beef sandwich I&#39;ve had by far, though I didn&#39;t expect it from a fast casual chain. The bread was fresh, the mozzarella was shredded rather than fresh type and didn&#39;t melt very well, just becoming globby, and the beef was tasty if not terribly plentiful. The parmesan chips were outstanding: kettle-style chips covered with pepper, herbs and powdered parmesan (there&#39;s a shaker at your table if you&#39;re like me and want to load on more). 

I rounded out the meal with a cup of the chocolate-hazelnut gelato, which had a nice flavor but leaned a bit towards iciness in texture. You&#39;re do better by going a couple of blocks west on Ogden to Gelati or Gelato Dream for your Italian ice cream fix. 

Buona has a nice dining room as well as a screened-in outdoor seating area, which I took advantage of while the weather was still nice! 

All told, Buona is a good lunch option. Ciao bella!"

The bun is always perfectly toasted and the patty is nice and juicy.  Comes with all the regular toppings, cheese and bacon are extra.  It&#39;s drippingly greasy, which is probably why it tastes so good.  I get cravings sometimes, despite knowing how unhealthy it must be.  You owe it to yourself to try this burger.

All that aside, every time I&#39;ve been here the service is great, cashiers and people who bring you your food have always been friendly and smiley.  Food can be hit or miss; like I said, the burger&#39;s to die for, I&#39;ve had the ham and brie on a pretzel bun which wasn&#39;t great, their beef is just OK (was a little dry, if I remember correctly), but their fresh potato chips are yummy, and the blueberry verde salad is delish.

The Italian beef has that special combination of their seasoned au jus, homemade giadinera (hot peppers), and the Turano bread that is addicting.

The restaurant has a modern feel and is very nicely decorated- you can get all your favorites from the old school hot dog stands in a much nicer atmosphere. 

Odd story- I&#39;d ordered my dinner, picked a table, sat down... two very wild 3 or so year old girls come running back near where I was sitting and begin running back and forth on the long bench-type seat where I was. Grandpa comes over and tells one of them to stop and how they&#39;ve discussed that before. He turns and goes back to the counter and they started right up again. Grandma comes back with the spawns of hell and tells me, &#34;You don&#39;t want to sit here, trust me.&#34; I said, &#34;Huh?&#34; She says it again. I considered reminding her that I&#39;d been sitting there and don&#39;t see why I should have to move. As one of the girls screamed and pulled something down on the other side of the restaurant, I figured she had her hands full as it is, said, &#34;Thanks, I&#39;ll take your word for it&#34; picked up my things and moved to the other side of the restaurant. As I did so, grandma said to one of the girls &#34;That man has to move because he wants to enjoy a quiet dinner and you and your sister are too wild.&#34; I&#39;m sure that resonated well with the 3 year old. Anyway, based on the screaming, falling furniture, etc. that I heard from that corner of the restaurant, I learned my lesson: if someone with children advises that you move, just do it. Do not ask questions, do not pass go, do not collect $200, just go."

(Clearly, I was TOO broke in college to dine out!) Sushi House is located right across from Naperville River Walk and the Nichols Library. 

Environment - This cozy little sushi place is put together real well! It has tables, boots, and also tatami style seating! Quite charming with beautiful decor and great ambiance! The staff is super friendly and knowledgeable. We were seated immediately. After sitting down, we were given warm wet towels to clean up, followed by drinks!

Food - The sushi was great! We ordered the Sexy Mexican Roll (I mean the name says it all!), Dragon Roll, and Double Spice Roll. They were all equally delicious! My favorite was the Sexy Mexican Roll, which had Alaska king crab meat, tempura shrimp cilantro, avocado, crunchy chips covering. The seafood was fresh and plentiful!  Right by the exit door there is a huge bowl of Fortune Cookies..took a couple for kicks!

It is disappointing to read that some Yelpers thought this place had horrible service..which was anything but the truth. Even in a full house we were greeted and seated fast. I would back here again just for the kind service and of course the Sexy Mexican Roll ; )"

But with the oncoming of cold weather I had the taste for a comforting bowl of soup, and decided to find out where I could get a bowl of udon soup without having to trek out to Mitsuwa (my usual  place for it). 

As it turns out, Sushi House has it! In several forms. I had the tempura udon (bowl of broth and chewy, ropy noodles, with a side of two shrimp and two vegetables). My boyfriend upgraded by a couple dollars and got the nabeyaki udon (hot pot), which includes the tempura but has a richer broth including egg and mushrooms. I would go for that next time. 

We started out with a sushi roll (#3 roll), which was tasty though a little odd: it&#39;s a deep fried spicy tuna roll, and it was still hot from the deep frying. Both of us said we&#39;d never had hot sushi before (not spicy; temperature-wise) -- it warred with the rice and was just kind of weird, though the fish tasted good and all. 

We had a long wait after the sushi roll and our waitress really didn&#39;t check with us at all. The place was busy but not crazy on a Saturday night. 

I will also note that the hours on their website are wrong. On the door it says Saturday they close for lunch at 2:30 and reopen for dinner at 6 (website says Saturday open 12:00-10:30pm). We called to find out the hours at 5 and the phone rang and rang, then cut off with no message or information. Either update the website or leave the hours on your voicemail (or both), because this is confusing.

Overall, good food, but a little put off by service on this occasion, and the confusion over hours didn&#39;t help matters either."

Now for the not so great but not horrible, that same service was from a waitress that was way too pushy and actually lied to us. We were going to order 2 different sushi rolls and then see if we were still hungry for more and she says you should put in the order for 3 sushi rolls as the 2 we ordered were small servings, they were normal size, and they had a large party coming in and only 2 sushi chefs, inferring it would take a long time to get the an additional role. We were there for another half hour and the place was half empty when we left, there wasn&#39;t any big party. Also she kept trying to get us to order the more expensive rolls.

It was a nice reminder of why we come back. We had a sushi assortment that included maki, nigiri, and sashimi.  The pieces were generous, the fish very fresh.  We even had some mochi for dessert.  Everything was excellent, including the sake. We will be back soon! Yes, you might pay more than the &#34;discount sushi&#34; places but in my opinion, you get what you pay for applies here."

We would always have Poke Salad paired with either sashimi platter or his choice of roll. I know we ordered the same thing every time but the taste &amp; presentation is consistent. I like that most of the staff recognize us already and for me this is a very cozy place. The price though is $$$, we would love to come here every week lol! I remember trying their bento box it was good too but didn&#39;t get to finish it since I had poke salad already.

Another good thing is the location of this restaurant. Downtown Naperville is a short drive for us plus there are shops like Gap, Barnes &amp; Noble, Banana Republic, Loft in the area."

They are located in Naperville Downtown which is a great location for any sushi restaurant to be established. The dining room is small. It can seat a party of about 15 people. The food is expensive! For what you get. It&#39;s not anything to write home about for sure.

Let&#39;s see I ordered the chirashi bowl it was good. However, I had asked the waitress if the dinner had Unagi, which I cannot eat, she said No. Sure enough when I get the chirashi it had unagi, it was disappointed. I gave to my cousin so enjoyed it. I didn&#39;t think about complaining until later on and It was too late to say something.

The sushi rolls are tasty and the tempura was fried nicely. It had the traditional light crunchy batter you typically see with tempura. I felt the food was fairly priced for what you get.  It cost about $25 for a bento it comes with rice, a California roll, meat and I think literally 3 pieces of tempura two shrimps and one vegetable. It sounds like a lot of food. It sounds like a lot of food but it was great.

It took about an hour or longer to get our food after we ordered our lunch. We ate a late Mother&#39;s Day lunch at around 2 o&#39; clock in the afternoon. We didn&#39;t get out of that restaurant until like close to 4:45 p.m..  Sigh I&#39;m glad we tried it I probably won&#39;t be back."

Listen if I were judging this place on fish and sake alone it would easily be 4 to 5 stars unfortunately for the $120+ bill I&#39;ll gladly go somewhere much better with a much more knowledgeable and courteous staff and a much less drab environment. In fact I&#39;ve had much better for less than fifty bucks. 

Sake tasters are out of this world good. Miso soup was extraordinary. Sashimi was incredible, or so I was told by what I consider an expert. Sushi was right on. 

So I am no expert when it comes to sushi but I&#39;ve had my fair share.  I ordered what I assumed would be a bunch of rolls, the Sushi Platter - chefs choice, but came as what I&#39;d consider more sashimi than sushi. 10 pieces or so of raw fish on rice. Which i found out later is nigiri. My mistake but when we asked what the platter &#34;usually&#34; entails before ordering we were told &#34;it says right there on the menu&#34; which tbh said nothing more than 10 pieces of sushi and a California roll. Ok. Why not say 10 pcs of nigiri and 1 roll then? Well I like pizza and hamburgers and tacos, forgive my ignorance. When the platter came I was a little surprised so I politely asked if that was what I had ordered and was almost scolded and told that&#39;s what I ordered. Ok. Fine. I&#39;ll give it a shot. Some delicious, some not my cup of tea.  

We ordered 2 sake tasters, 1 hot to start and 1 cold with the meal. First was great. It was flavored with apple and pear I believe. Awesome stuff. 

The second unfortunately did not go so well. A 2nd or maybe 3rd different waitress came and said &#34;the same&#34; pointing at the sake and we said yes but cold like 3 times. The third waitress brings the hot. Ok. Again politely I say we actually ordered the cold and this is where it goes south. She says &#34;you said the same&#34; I say no we ordered cold 4 times. She tells me I said the same, then proceeds to turn around, right in front of us, and tells the other waitress we ordered hot but now want cold. Ummmm no. That was it for me. No more conversation or you telling me what I did or did not say. Just take the wrong shit and don&#39;t say another word to me. Done. She then proceeded to keep arguing her point when she brought the hot sake they had obviously put in the fridge for a few minutes. I couldn&#39;t handle anymore. My party stayed I left. Great food and drink, the worst service I&#39;ve ever had. Save your money. Go somewhere else."

This restaurant was the place that I first was introduced to those little rolls and raw fish that I&#39;ve come to love.  After trying many sushi restaurants in the area, and there is a good selection in Naperville to chose from, I&#39;ve come to like a couple other places better.  What I do like about Sushi House is their private little rooms for small groups, maybe 6-10 people, where you need to take off your shoes and sit on the floor on pillows behind bamboo doors. I enjoy that aspect of this place as no other sushi restaurant offers that. It feels authentic. One of my favorite rolls over other places is their crunchy maki.  I haven&#39;t found one I like more. The food is good but not a wow kind of place. The staff is minimal, but friendly. There were only 4 others tables occupied at dinner time so I don&#39;t think reservations are necessary unless you want one of the private rooms which is pretty cool.  I would come back here again if I&#39;m shopping in town. Good food, but nothing special."

I&#39;m so glad it came into my life 20 years ago,  when my friend Alison convinced me to try it.  Sushi House is a local sushi chain, but every branch I&#39;ve been to has been good. Since I don&#39;t use chopsticks, sushi would be a bad first date food for me to choose.  However, since I am married to a woman who accepts me for who I am, I do not need to worry about first dates. That is a good thing.  But back to the restaurant.  The tuna and eel are tasty.  They have a good selection of rolls. A bit too many have cream cheese in them, which I do not like. I have enjoyed the teriyaki and tempora dishes. This is also one of those Japanese restaurants that has floor-level seating.  That&#39;s sort of where the cool sushi-eaters sit. I don&#39;t feel I know enough about sushi to sit there.  But you have that choice.  The service can be slow.  All in all, dinner here and a stroll along the riverwalk make for a pleasant evening out."

It always annoys me when I go to a restaurant and the server has a hard time understanding the English language. I ordered the Sushi, sashimi,with a California roll dinner for $25.00 and had asked the server if I can substitute the California roll for a spicy tuna roll. The server said nothing. I asked if there was a substitution charge and the server was confused and asked &#34;substitution charge?&#34; I asked the server if my order was taken down correctly, and to repeat my order. The server repeated the order with California roll. So I asked if I could substitute, and the server went to check with the chef, came back and said the cost would be the difference between the California roll  and the spicy tuna roll, which is $2.00. I then checked the menu and asked the server again to confirm the price difference because the menu shows the California roll  for $6 vs the spicy tuna roll for $7.00, which would mean it was only $1 difference. The food came out and it was beautiful as well as delicious. I love when the fish is a thick cut for the sashimi, as well as a thick cut for the nigiri. I am a fan of the significant fish to minimal rice ratio. The spicy tuna, by far... has been one of the best spicy tuna I&#39;ve had in the Chicago land area.  In my picture, it shows that I had wasabi on there. Yes. I already had wasabi. I asked the server for more wasabi because I love wasabi. Then you can hear the chef and the server arguing about giving me more wasabi.  The chef yelling that the plate doesn&#39;t need more wasabi and wasabi is expensive and would be a waste if she doesn&#39;t use it all. Yes. I know that the chefs behind the counter speaks Mandarin. The server speaks Mandarin. I speak Mandarin. In the end, I did get my wasabi, but unkind things were said about my need for extra wasabi. Will I come back here for the food? Of course. But the service. Goodness. Please work on your service and don&#39;t assume that your customers don&#39;t understand when you&#39;re talking crap about them."

The parking lot was crammed tight but we snagged a good one on the street.

Getting in was kind of a confusing sort of maze - up some stairs and through hallways and such. It almost felt like navigating a weird sort of office building.

The decor of the restaurant was a bit tired. I&#39;m sure that it was once en vogue but now it was at the start of it&#39;s decline.

The restaurant employees were quick to guess that we had an event downstairs at Pinot&#39;s Pallet downstairs and they understood our hurry. They encouraged us to sit anywhere we wanted and quickly took our orders and then served us. They even brought us hot, moist towels!

My friend got some soup. She seemed satisfied with it. My dad and I shared the Sexy Mexican Roll ($16) and the Spicy Hamachi Crunch ($13).

The Sexy Mexican was delicious. It had guacamole on top and the Mexican flavors fused beautifully with Japanese. You would have thought that they were siblings!

The Spicy Hamachi Crunch was another story. I actually think they served us the wrong thing because it wasn&#39;t crunchy at all and was really fishy. Neither of us cared much for it but we ate it all nonetheless.

Lastly, the bathroom was exactly like what you&#39;d find in a drab office building. It was outside of the restaurant and in the hall. I was aware that I had to touch three door handles upon returning to my table."

I was greeted immediately and my drink order was taken. I wasn&#39;t feeling very adventurous, so I decided to copycat what Taylor ordered - a blue martini, followed by a super crunch roll (something to that effect) and the Philly roll.

The crunchy roll was very good. It had spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, a Rice Krispies type batter, and sweet eel sauce. It was not at all authentic, but it was very large and I would love to eat this again. The Philly roll was massive, with large chunks of salmon, and a ridiculous amount of cream cheese. I liked the size but found the fish to not be very flavorful and the cheese overpowered it. It&#39;s unlikely I&#39;d order that again, but I would like to try some other rolls.

One of the nice things about Sushi House is that the employees were very attentive and could tell we were having a rough evening. They made the martinis especially strong, which I may not have liked on any other day, but it was appropriate during this dining experience. I don&#39;t think they are typically this potent, so it was much appreciated."

They were actually in the same building.  The parking here is a little funky, but this place was definitely worth driving around.  I arrived first and waited for Ericka at the sushi bar.  The sushi chef and server kept me company and made me laugh.  They were even teasing me for being so bubbly and happy.  I had fun chatting with them.

Ericka and I ordered matching meals.  A Crunchy Roll and a Philly Roll paired with a Blue Light martini.  The rolls seemed pricey on the menu, but when I got them I understood why.  They were much larger than the rolls you get at other sushi restaurants.  Also, they had hug chunks of fish in them... they were not trying to cut any costs here.  I came super hungry and couldn&#39;t finish the two rolls.  They also brought us both complimentary miso soups... yum.  Everything was delicious.  

The martini deserves a paragraph of its own it was so good.  First off, it was STRONG and this is coming from a girl who likes her vodka.  They warned me it was going to be strong when they set it down and told me they could make it weaker if I wanted, but I am no weenie.  It was mostly vodka with a smidgen of grape flavoring.  The kicker was the vodka infused grape on the bottom.  You could get drunk off the grape alone... I left buzzed.

I will definitely return if I am in Naper-thrill again!"

I love nigiri, but I tend to avoid ordering it at restaurants because the pieces are usually packed with too much rice and the nigiri itself isn&#39;t that tasty. However, I always order the Sushi Deluxe (9 Nigiri and 1 California roll) at Sushi House because the fish is so fresh, and it&#39;s very easy to taste its quality. Moreover, there&#39;s more fish than rice - a sure sign that you&#39;re getting what you paid for. If you&#39;re not into sushi, you can&#39;t go wrong with the Teriyaki steak. Every time I&#39;ve ordered it, it has always been cooked exactly as I asked for, and the sauce is so good. The udon noodle soup, too, is excellent, and it&#39;s really filling as well. 

You can&#39;t go wrong with this place. Not only is the food fantastic, but it&#39;s a classy-looking restaurant, and the staff is very friendly as well."

Me, the sister and her kiddo&#39;s came for sushi time.  I love the hot towel before the meal, the kids loved it too.  We started with a bowl of Edamame.  For the 3 and 7 year old we ordered a teriyaki chicken for them to split while me and the sis went with sushi.  Spicy tuna and spicy salmon.  Both were really good, I think I liked the spicy salmon more.  It wasn&#39;t as hot.

Word of warning for those dining with small children, wasabi might look an awful lot like guacamole in the eyes of babes.  My poor little nephew made the mistake of grabbing a handful and mouthful of the green stuff.  While it was laughable after the fact, keep it far away from little hands.

Grab a fortune on your way out."

I took 3 colleagues here for a business lunch meeting per their request. I love sushi and I love downtown Naperville so I assumed this would be a home run, as it is difficult to find disappointing food in the area. 

First of all, the dirty joke telling waitress that everyone raves about? She doesn&#39;t know her audience, making dirty jokes to the 1 gentleman present about how he should take the 3 women home with him. We are in suits having a meeting! Awkward and inappropriate.

Second, the sushi smelled and tasted fishy. And one of my rolls was half-cooked when it wasn&#39;t supposed to be. I can usually clean house when I eat sushi and in this case I ordered 2 rolls and didn&#39;t finish either of them. ick.

And finally, the kicker. I was so incredibly ILL that night words do not suffice to describe it. I spent the next day sick in bed with food poisoning. For a sushi lover, I may be turning my nose up at it for quite some time after this experience. I sincerely doubt the freshness of their fish and for that matter the cleanliness of the area it is prepared on.

Beware. I&#39;ll leave it at that."

Seriously, she&#39;s a total rock star and makes me laugh my ass off. I&#39;d love to write some of her material on here but the typical me can only remember the damn punch lines and I don&#39;t want to steal her thunder. She is a riot and totally makes your visit the best it can possibly be. The sushi here is pretty damn good, too, but it is a little pricier than other places but I wouldn&#39;t mind them instituting some happy hour specials every now and then. 

In the warmer weather months, you can sit outside and enjoy food without being bothered by the busy downtown Naperville passers by hovering over you to get a glimpse of your food or cleavage or whatever because this restaurant faces away from the downtown area and right across the street from the quiet Naperville library. This seating option comes in handy when I take my cat out for a walk in his pet stroller (it&#39;s made for pets, don&#39;t worry) in downtown Naperville, since my boyfriend is ultra embarrassed to be walking around with a lady with a cat in a stroller and doesn&#39;t want to be seen by a lot of people. I guess I don&#39;t blame him, it is pretty weird but it&#39;s something I enjoy and I won&#39;t let anyone&#39;s judgement phase me or keep me from enjoying some sushi with my cat on a midsummer&#39;s day. 

The inside decor is nice too, for when we go sans feline, that is. They even have these little private rooms separated by paper and bamboo walls where your group can be closed off and sit on pillows and do super secret stuff because no one in restaurant can see you. I&#39;ve never had the privilege to be seated in one of those rooms but I have made it a goal of mine before I die... And let me tell you, I&#39;ve got TONS of super secret stuff planned to do back there."

Yvonne ordered the Sexy Mexican and another sushi roll that was supposed to be spicy. The service was very fast. Yvonne&#39;s guest ordered soup. 
The food was delivered. The Sexy Mexican was fabulous. It has a delicate crunch on the outside layer that was a pleasant surprise. It was delicious. The spicy one was not spicy, but it still had good flavor.
I like my wasabi to blast up to my sinuses and make my ears glow red. The wasabi that was served with the rolls was very meek and mild, a disappointment. The ginger was flavorful and refreshing.

I have been coming here with my daughter for at least 10 years and have never had a bad experience. And if something was wrong with my order (i.e. wrong item) they always go out of their way to correct it and make up for it.  I do take out more often than not, but I also stay and sit out side and read a book after coming from the library (across the street) when the outdoor space is set up. This place is great for gatherings too.

My dining companions are big fans of sushi and per their reviews; the food was quite good. I tried the hot and sour soup and found it quite tasty plus I noticed that they had additional non sushi items I would be willing to potentially try. I really liked and appreciated the wait staff. We told them that we were in a hurry and they provided prompt and hospitable service. I would definitely dine here again. If you park in the lot to the east of the building there is a glass door that directs you to take the stairs up to the 2nd level where the entrance is located.

- Great sushi
- Good service
- My favorite atmosphere... Simple and quiet. No DJ music.... 
- Good hot tea
- Outdoor seating

Cons:
- Brown rice only available Friday and Saturday... 
- No specials for certain days (e.g. 30% off rolls on Wednesday like Sushi Train) 
- Parking is a usually a mess

If they asked each person which type of rice they want (or added it to the menu) I bet more people would order brown rice and they would make more money.  

Seems simple, right?  More happy customers and more revenue. 

Unfortunately, brown rice is not listed anywhere on the menu (ever!). You have to call &#34;Miss Cleo&#34; to find out when brown rice is served.

The quality of food for the price just didn&#39;t cut it anymore.  Most of the dishes taste mediocre and standard.  I haven&#39;t tasted anything that seems very special.  

Don&#39;t get me wrong, I think they have decent food.  I always like to get the Yaki Soba with Beef when I go.  But the catch is that my noodle soup would cost $10 per bowl.  You can also get a Udon noodles for the same price but if you are an avid instant noodles-eater like me, you&#39;ll soon realized that all you were really paying for is a more luxurious version of (instant) noodle soup.  Their sushi is just OK too, no Ah-Hah factor or of any sort.  And yes, they are sorta expensive. 

On top of that, they aren&#39;t very group friendly.  Like all of my other reviews, the ability to split the tabs at restaurants is huge plus.  They don&#39;t offer it here.  On top of that, when we asked for it, our waitress in particular gave a face and it was quite evident she was annoyed that we asked.  She then proceeded to say something in foreign language to another staff member on her way out. 

So in summary,  OK food, nothing special.  If you have a need for Asian food and there isn&#39;t any other option and you are feeling generous with your wallet, then this place is going to feel worth it.  Other than that, for a high-end Japanese restaurant, they could improve a little bit in the customer service/ mannerism department and put a little more zing into the quality of their foods."
sushi-house-naperville,Heather J.,GX_UaOZNnS2iekRGDCExkA,"Berkley, MI",1,1,0,620,135,TRkFOZmpzIcjdBP7Rz2aPQ,2.0,2011-10-26,"Sushi House fills a niche for the uncertain, discerning diner who wants to try sushi in a safe environment and will disregard price as an object (at least up to $100) for doing so. I&#39;ve revised my opinion downwards over the years particularly on the issue of price point.

Right across from Nichols Library, Sushi House is a slick joint full of pretty woods, polished metal and glass, and an impressively large flatscreen TV projecting a fish tank I would die to have. Not a real fish tank, the recording of that tank I would never have to clean or fish I would worry about feeding. Some of the private party rooms are contained by tatami screens, well worth the enjoyment for a larger party comfortable with sitting Japanese-style. 

Sushi House&#39;s servers are discreet and polite, though not exactly prompt. They fall short in refilling drinks or taking secondary orders if you decide to use the order sheet for a la carte choices. Hint, sit up by the sushi chefs and it&#39;s not a problem. Doubly they will entertain you with great conversation and a performance of making sushi, sashimi, nigiri, and fantastically pretty rolls. Presentation means more here than in other restaurants, but you pay through the nose for that privilege. 

Sushi House&#39;s menu falls into a la carte sushi; rolls; and other assorted Japanese standbys from tempura to miso soup and donburi. Bento boxes are affordable if uninspired options for lunch. I&#39;ve had one too many bland chicken teriyakis with a California roll and three pieces of tempura to be tempted by their like. I&#39;m in particular fond of zarusoba or udon if you want a filling meal for under $10; trust me on getting those instead and walking away full. That&#39;s my whole problem with Sushi House really: to get a satisfying meal you have to spend, and spend, and spend. Realistically sushi in Chicagoland won&#39;t be cheap as the nearest ocean is 1,700 miles away, give or take. Fish get flown in, and that has a price tag. It just needn&#39;t be this flipping high, especially when I can dine in the middle of the city without forfeiting my car payment or rent to satisfy two people. Their arrangements of specialty rolls are some of their best offerings, but at $15 a pop, you won&#39;t likely want to get many. Some of the cheaper maki, especially cucumber and avocado rolls, are tiny, bite-sized creations which satisfy for flavour but not for hunger. I typically would get a few of each, then fill up on miso and green tea to save money as I&#39;m fairly budget conscious. 

The food is good, but not exceptional. Freshness is a factor to good sushi and they understand this. But spicy rolls are often swallowed up in pools of sauce or woefully dim, even when I specifically ask the server or write on the order form to make it spicy. Ask the chefs directly and you will usually get what you want. The American palate is not always friendly towards too much spice, and I&#39;m not a fan of spicy mayo sauce at any rate. But give me the lyrical blend of sushi components and let them sing instead of muffling them for fears I might not enjoy. Oh well.

Sushi House&#39;s fatal flaw come to light on a night of dismal service and bad food. Our server ignored a party of three for over an hour. We got miso lukewarm, our teas and waters were never refilled, and half our order never showed up though we tried to check in with our waitress and then other servers. We were sitting in the middle of the restaurant and had next to no service. Our food, what did arrive, was only a fraction of what we ordered. Two rolls weren&#39;t even ours and promptly whisked away, the only prompt thing happening then. We were charged for sushi we never got, and the head server did not take nicely to us quietly and politely disputing the errors as we resolved our bill. By this point is was nearly 9 PM, we were disappointed, tired, and still hungry. We paid the corrected amount rather than wait for the sushi we asked for no less than four times to get hastily made by a chef ready to go to the grocery store for &#34;real&#34; dinner, and then home.

As we went back to the car, our waitress came running out after us.

To apologize? To explain? To return something we forgot? 

To demand we pay her a tip, because we hadn&#39;t left one on the bill or the table. 

As if."

I like this place A LOT. It&#39;s right in downtown Naperville, the staff is super friendly, and they always have a special item on the menu that always changes. Me likey!

We had the Unagi, of course, and the spicy tuna. I highly recommend the Unagi, it&#39;s deelish. We also had the Philly roll, which had a smoked ham taste to it when all the flavors came together and danced on our tastebuds.

And, of course, we had the Sexy Mexican roll. I&#39;m not even going to bother describing it because the description for this roll should say &#34;Will give you a foodgasm&#34;. I highly recommend that you try the Sexy Mexi if it&#39;s on the menu when you come here. I also suggest getting some plum wine to go with your foodgasm.

As I said before, I like this place A LOT. Great service, great price to quality ratio, and a great location. I definitely recommend coming here when it&#39;s nice out so you can walk around downtown Naperville or take a stroll along the riverwalk after eating here.

I&#39;ll definitely be showing my beautiful face here in the future.

I was surprised this place was so dead at 8:00 on a Saturday nite. We ordered edamame and satay. Not thrilled with the satay to begin with. Then we ordered 3 kinds of sushi rolls. Some were good and some had a weird taste to it. I don&#39;t think I would go back there. I&#39;ve found other sushi places in Naperville that I would prefer to go.

The rolls here are fresh and delicious, but the noodles and other fare (like dashi tofu) are also notable. In terms of pricing, it&#39;s on par for a sushi place.

My only gripe about this location is that one of the servers engages in inappropriate conversation. While I was trying to eat my dinner, she was asking all sorts of personal questions and then goes on to tell me about woes with her son and her recent car accident. No problem if we have a rapport, but I didn&#39;t know this waitress on a personal level, and she had given me poor service on many prior occasions.

I was assuming the location in Wheaton had the same menu, but surprise! They had some fried oysters that were superb that are not offered at the Naperville location. Next up: Sushi House in Westmont."

It&#39;s never super crowded when we go, which we like, and the service is good. Water and tea are filled regularly, which is a big plus in my book.

In my mind&#39;s eye, there&#39;s this mythical place where the sushi is excellent, but the service is forgiving enough to make us corn-fed Midwesterners fell a tad bit less self-conscious as we&#39;re fumbling through the menu.

In the case of sushi house, the food was &#34;fine&#34; and the wait staff was &#34;fine&#34;.  I found myself having to apologize to a visibly bored, borderline irritated waitress as we kept asking &#34;what&#39;s in a dragon roll again?&#34; etc etc.

This has nothing to do with the restaurant itself (read first review for that info).

Story # 1:
One night 4 years ago I brought my gf at the time here for our 1 yr anniversary. We&#39;re having a good time enjoying sushi when my ex goes to the bathroom. 

Old Japanese waitress approaches my table. She had a deep accent:
Waitress: Oooohh is that your gf?
Me: Yes
Waitress: Oh really? How old are you?
Me: XXX (thats right, I&#39;m actually 143 years old)
Waitress: My son 22 and he have no girlfriend, how you do it?
Me: Uhhh...I&#39;m nice..?
Waitress: Oh nice, yes yes
She walks away! It was so hard for me not to laugh. 

Story # 2:
This involves the SAME old Japanese watiress! Fast forward 3 years and I&#39;m eating dinner here with my 2 best friends. She approaches our table:
Waitress: You know condom?
Us: ..................................Yea......
Waitress: It comes in 3 sizes: small, medium and LIAR! He he he he
She walks away. 
We BURST into laughter. WHY did she think of this joke to randomly tell us?! WHO told her this joke!? Its ridiculous! (but true hahaha)

The place: standard decor - warm hues, bench seating around the perimeter and tables on the inside - the place is smaller than I would have thought from the outside. 

The service: it was lunch time so we had this woman server and she asked us to start out with some sake - and when we declined she said, &#34;Are you sure, it&#39;s very good, and we have all kinds.&#34; -- Okay, &#34;no&#34; for a second time, and then she&#39;s like, &#34;You want to start out with some appetizer - some lobster or something like that&#34; -- 

clearly this woman is out to raise her ticket average = more tip - or so she thinks. 

We didn&#39;t order a lot - 2 miso soups - and a few maki rolls and some green tea - it was a light lunch - the rolls were okay - I really think, in Naperville, Kiku is so much better - 

Although I may have to give it another try because one of the ladies at Sur La Table said it was &#34;amazing&#34; -- I didn&#39;t think so... I thought the rolls were average. 

What was amazing was this server - she was relentless to up the check average, offering us more rolls and when my friend took the check and said she was treating -the woman is like, &#34;Oh, she&#39;s your boss - and she pay - you should have ordered the lobster and more rolls&#34;

Service - 2 out of 5. We&#39;ve had better. Our waitress could not describe the dishes we asked about. I think she was more concerned about turnover and seems annoyed when we asked her questions. I think management should educate the serving staff better on this thing called &#34;CUSTOMER SERVICE&#34;."

Pretty standard pricing for the food and typical menu selections.

The last time we went, I tried their sake sampler which I thought was good.  Not enough to get drunk, but enough to get a nice taste of the flavors being presented.

The dining room is pretty nice with a good view of the sushi bar.  The decor is pretty traditional for a Japanese restaurant."

I realize that I am eating fish but two of the three different types of tuna rolls we had were a little on the fishy side. We didnt get anything fancy but I saw some very fun looking rolls go by on their way to other tables. 

If I had known they had semi-private rooms where you sit on the floor and big paper lamps, I would have called to reserve one. I want the whole experience!"

I have been here so many times and I am NEVER disappointed!!! And OMG... the staff is soooooo friendly ALWAYS!!!! The miso soup is great, and all the rolls I have tried are yummy. The fish has always been fresh - sushi / sashimi - i would recommend it all. Very good!!! And the pricing is very reasonable! The only thing I would say is that they don&#39;t really feature anything that is &#39;unique. Pretty much everything I have seen on the menu is pretty standard compared to other Sushi Restaurants so don&#39;t expect an eclectic experience here, just good sushi. 

Biggest perk, it is located adjacent to one of the largest parking lots - so anyone that is familiar with DT Naperville, knows what a  nightmare parking can be like!!!

This is definitely one of my FAVE restaurants in the area!!!!"
sushi-house-naperville,G S.,T6UrN8iMtOtoDxT77o3ZOw,"Naperville, IL",0,1,0,88,464,KaHc1Jjv_jsZpOUj0tD43A,2.0,2009-04-08,"I agree with pretty much everyone that the sushi is overpriced for the quality and value.  My general rating for sushi restaurant relies on the following:

1. Waiting Staff - The waiting staff is similar to that of a typical chinese restaurant.  While you have only one waiter, all the waiters are more than happy to help.  They are pretty responsive, but asking them to describe dishes can be painstaking.  I don&#39;t think the waiters are taught about all the dishes nor do they know.  But, it is more important that they are responsive so they excel on this point.

2. Clean Atmosphere -  Everything looks very clean and it looks like most of the staff cares as well.
 
3. Selection of Sushi (raw fish, not rolls) - The selection of raw fish is usually the best indicator of how much they understand sushi and what is most important.  I can&#39;t remember what they lack, but it&#39;s a decent selection.  I think they hit the more common sushi types like tuna and salmon.  I think what makes a good sushi selection is adding more exotic type seafood such as urchin.  

4. Cut of the sushi - The cut of the sushi tends to tell you a lot about the chef behind the bar.  In this respect, Sushi House fails.  The cuts are pretty lazy and while sometimes they can be generous, the right filet width can mean the difference between amazing texture and mediocre.

5. Price of Sushi - This place is definitely overpriced.  I would pay this amount at some other places that provided much fresher and better cut sushi.

6. Freshness of Sushi - My general indicators for freshness usually hinges on some of the smellier seafoods (yellowtail and tuna).  If they have a fishy aftertaste or reak of some seafood smell, that&#39;s usually not the best indicator for freshness.  In addition, great sushi melts in your mouth with no aftertaste.  In this respect, Sushi house fails; Sushi House&#39;s tend to be a bit fishy in those seafoods and is chewier than most sushi places of this price.

I know this review is a bit exhaustive, but I thought that this might give a little more meat as to what makes me want to come back to a Sushi restaurant.  So to sum, the service and cleanliness is okay, but the food quality versus price does not justify a repeat chance to this place."

I don&#39;t believe paying more money = better sushi.  in fact, i think most places around this area are overpriced for what they offer.  Sushi house is no exception, but if you line sushi house next to Blu Coral, Kiku&#39;s, Sushi House, Wild Tuna, i would rank Sushi House #1.  Their food is creative, and not drowned in mayonnaise like the rest of the other restaurants.  You should definitely try their Naperville Roll -- SOO refreshing, and the Sexy Mexican Roll -- unique, flavorful, and is truly ingenious.  I also love their udon (called the nabeyaki, which comes with a plate of shrimp and veggie tempura), and i had their lunch bento box there once, which was also fantastic."

The food is good, the wait-staff is excellent, and the dining area is comfortable. I always have a good time.

If you like spicy tuna, this is a good place to get it. It&#39;s not chopped into a paste like some other places, you get some nice hunks of fish. The hand rolls are expensive, so I&#39;d share some rolls or get the individual pieces instead. Look for special or seasonal rolls they&#39;ll have advertised on the chalkboard, or ask your waiter. (The Chicago Bears roll is particularly amusing.)"

I may be a bit biased because I visit often and the servers know us by name but they are genuinely nice and attentive to everyone there.

I can&#39;t speak for the rest of the menu but the sushi is great.  The Sexy Mexican is my favorite, but the Volcano, Double Spicy, and Crunchy Roll are awesome too.  The sushi is affordable and high quality.  They even have some unique things like oyster shooters.

The one thing I would skip is their edamame, it&#39;s not the greatest consistency, but otherwise this place is a gem!"

The sushi is amazing, the chefs will make you little special treats, and the waitstaff is super nice.  Ask to sit in Sachico&#39;s section, she will take good care of you.  Tell you Jennie (my names Jennae but she pronounces it Jennie:) sent you.  Everything about this place is perfect.  Perfect timing between courses, perfectly smooth sake selection (they have a sake martini that&#39;s to die for), perfect presentation that&#39;s not overwhelming and actually adds to the course instead of distracting it and most importantly, they make you feel comfortable, even if you have no idea what you are doing.  We went here with no idea of how to order, what to order, or how to behavior for that matter. Sachico walked us through everything and made recommendations every week.

There&#39;s always plenty of parking. The lot is huge and wraps around the building.  They have a nice open patio in the front, although I&#39;ve never sat out there, it looks roomy and pretty nice.  The bar area is very large and the seats are comfortable..the restaurant is the same - very spacious. It&#39;s nice to feel like you&#39;re not sitting right on top of people in here, even if it&#39;s crowded (which it is... all the time!)  It&#39;s casual, but everyone seems to be the &#34;after work&#34; variety in jeans and a nice shirt.  I don&#39;t feel out of place if I wear jeans, or dress up a bit more.

They play a decent selection of music, but it&#39;s not so loud that you have to yell over it.  The bar area has multiple TVs which always have some kind of sports-related thing on.

What sold me on this place (many years ago) was their &#34;beer with a kick&#34; options.  There used to be one called a &#34;French kiss&#34; it is a shot of Chambord and Blue Moon.  It is to DIE for!  I would have never imagined it would be such a great combo of flavors.  It&#39;s no longer on the menu, but can still be ordered (yay!)  I&#39;ve also had the Moscow Mule (perfect blend of booze and ginger flavor... I&#39;ve had it at other places and it wasn&#39;t nearly as good), Whiskey Smash (it has real strawberries in it! A pleasant surprise), Blackberry Collins (again, real berries and it was super tasty) and the Cucumber Southside (I liked it, tasted refreshing but could use just a bit more on the cucumber flavor).  There is an excellent selection of beers on tap as well and while I typically am a beer drinker... their mixed drinks always draw me in.

I&#39;ve had the food here as well in the past, but I honestly can&#39;t recall what I ordered.  I know I&#39;ve never had a complaint or left feeling frustrated... and the people I have gone with had the same opinion.  Their food is not typical, it is a bit closer to the upscale trendy bar type with each plate having a nice presentation.

Lately I&#39;ve gotten here around 5:30 on a Friday and it&#39;s reasonably crowded.  It gets even more crowded as the night progresses, but I&#39;m always able to get front row parking somehow - lol.  

I think this place is comfortable, with a good vibe of people and the service has always been stellar.  They are fully staffed behind the bar, never had to &#34;flag&#34; anyone down for a refill.  In fact, they&#39;re usually asking me before I&#39;ve decided on what the next cup of poison will be.  The hostess ALWAYS has a smile when walking in and holds the door open on the way out.  Overall, I&#39;m really happy with my experiences here whether I came for dinner or (most recently) for drinks after work to unwind.  I love it with a group, on a date or just by myself.  Always a good time."

However, I lost all respect for this place after what happened last night. Just like any other night, my friends and I were craving burgers so we decided to give this place a call since it was late and we wanted to know if the kitchen was still open. We called and the person on the phone said &#34;yes, the kitchen is still open&#34; with some hesitation. We arrived 3 minutes later and the kitchen was closed. WTF dude. I would not mind if the person on the phone just straight up told me that the kitchen is closed, but the fact that he wasted our time just pissed me off. On top of that, the waiter who &#34;greeted&#34; us at the door basically accused us of lying when we told him that we just got off the phone 5 minutes ago with another waiter who told us that the kitchen was still open. 

I know, I know, I am overreacting, but still tho. Anyway, as for the food. I would highly recommend the burgers, the duck wraps, and especially the chicken and waffle.

I came back for Happy Hour with a bunch of co-workers. There were drink specials but food was full price. The drink specials were good and it seemed like almost everything (not on top shelf) had some kind of deal, however the food adds up really quick.

I have not had a bad-tasting appetizer, but it&#39;s all what would be classified as &#34;bar food&#34;: lots of bread, and fried breading stuff. They seem slightly short on staff, and service is not bad but not impressive. 

Drinks are kinda pricey- $9.25 for a glass of house wine- but I guess that&#39;s what you&#39;d expect for the real estate.

There were about 30 of us.  I never thought I would be back here but I did.  This time it&#39;s with one of the few best bosses I have ever worked with. Unfortunately, she&#39;s left the company and I already miss her.  It always seems to turn out that way that the boss I love working with so much leaves. 

My colleague and I decided to spend dinner with her for the last time before she permanently left us.  This was the place that was chosen and a wonderful place it was.  From customer service to the cleanliness of the restaurant, to the food we ordered.

Our server was nice.  She seemed to know her menu which is always a plus in my book.  Since I don&#39;t ever know what to order at times, I look to the server to tell me what they like and then try it for myself.  The server said that she really liked the Chicken Pot Pie; it&#39;s deemed to be one of the popular dishes in their menu.  I can&#39;t say it&#39;s the best I have ever had, but it was really good.  The top crust was, however, the best part.  It was crunchy, not overcooked, and addicting.  The filling consisted of chicken and vegetables with the gravy.  That was also delicious.  I would come back here again."

The place was packed so that was the first good sign. The set up of the place is incredible. They have tables you can sit at like normal and they have tables you can sit at where comfortable sofas are on each side of the table so the setting is more cozy and home-like. When you walk around the bar they have TVs on entertainment centers and lazy boy style chairs--so the vibe you want can be chosen. We chose to just sit at the bar. Their service was impeccable. We ordered some calamari and the wings (which were phenomenal). The sauce used on the wings was out of this world and they were cooked perfectly crisp. We ordered some  beers too and the deals were great---$25.50 for a 96 OZ tower is a great price, especially coming from the city to the suburbs that was a nice break for the wallet. :)

The level of service was also outstanding! Bree and Joe made sure we were taken care of at all times---the girl who said she was new was also great I just forgot her name. They were all very nice and made sure our drinks were filled and that we had enough food. Joe made great conversation with us and made us feel even more comfortable. It&#39;s always nice when you get to know the people who are serving/bartending because it excites me when I hear what other people are doing with their lives. If I&#39;m ever in the burbs again I&#39;ll for sure come by to enjoy some food and cocktails."

Everything is just good. Good food, good beer, good vibe, good(ish) service. It&#39;s all just good. 

Don&#39;t get me wrong, surely you would find something you love about this place if you go enough and try the whole menu (I&#39;m guessing as I&#39;ve only been here twice) but when it comes to the total package, I&#39;d rather go elsewhere for whatever is it I&#39;m craving that Brickhouse happens to provide (food, beer, vibe, etc.) 

I&#39;ve tried a burger, wings, the fish and chips, and the bbq duck pizza. Nothing is a total standout...though the burger was the best thing I tried and the fish and chips were the worst. 

Overall, I really wanted to like Brickhouse but until it gets either an awesome craft beer list or a couple of menu items I can&#39;t go anywhere else for, I&#39;d probably not venture back in."

The food is not the bomb, but it&#39;s better than pub food, and the atmosphere is just fantastic!

We went Friday night pretty late and split the chicken and waffles. They didn&#39;t compare to some delicious ones I had in Detroit, as the chicken could use a kick, but it was still quite good, and plenty of food for sure!

We went back Sunday to have lunch with my husband&#39;s youngest bro. He got fried chicken eggs Benedict and loved it - and to be honest the chicken was thicker and really good.

We started with the zucchini starter with &#39;sriracha ranch dressing&#39; that didn&#39;t seem to have any sriracha in it.  I had the Greek meatballs which were pretty tasty. I&#39;d like to try the Thai salad at some point:)

My hubby had the Philly cheese steak and he loved it.

The fire pit, the &#39;man cave&#39;, the awesome comfy couches where you sit at a table to eat - all so cool!

I will definitely be back :)  What a fun, chill place to find in Downer&#39;s Grove!
I also loved the myriad TVs playing sports ;D

One small annoyance - to even order 1/2 a beer bong you need 2 beer drinkers..

Here on a Sunday just before the Bears game to a restaurant about half full. Every part of the experience had been bad. The waitress was non existent and the food was mediocre. The final blow was waiting 25 minutes for a drink that never came. She did get the manager here quick, which was the fastest thing we got. 

We have been there many times with average experiences, but will now consider the plethora of other options in the area.

The service is horrible.  I understand why the restaurant was 1/2 empty on a Friday night. We were 6 friends at dinner.  We ordered salads and appetizers.  The Caesar salad was a clump of chopped romaine with barely any dressing, 2 giant Bermuda onions and a single crouton.  The chopped salads were dry.  

The server was inattentive and indifferent.  Could barely get a water refill or extra salad dressing.  We asked for the manager and things went from bad to worse.  He was also indifferent.   Our bills were mixed up and incorrect.  2 of the bills, the manager was never able to get corrected.    I will not go back -- too bad.  The fireplace inside is amazing!!"

We stopped by prime time on a Saturday night for dinner, we had no problem getting a table even though they were busy. I didn&#39;t have high hopes for the beer menu outside of standard domestics but I was pleasantly surprised. I had a Bells Two Hearted and a Revolution Anti-Hero. 

Started with an order of the wings, they were very good but for $11.50 I would expect more than 6 wings. We got half buffalo and half the man cave sauce. The buffalo was nice and spicy, the man cave sauce was like a sweet &amp; sour, I wouldn&#39;t be sad eating either one again. 

I got the Bison burger (medium), tasted the turkey club, kobe beef pizza, meatloaf. I think the best item was the meatloaf, it was on top of garlic mashed potatoes. 

We were so full that we skipped dessert. Dinner was very long and that was great, we got to take our time, didn&#39;t feel rushed, our waitress was attentive and kept refilling waters.

I was there for two hours and ordered 2 Dirty Blondes (Stella + Guiness: $5.70), which were alright; nothing great. Our group ordered appetizers to share which included wings, deviled eggs, pretzel sticks, and flatbread. I didn&#39;t have the wings, but my buddy enjoyed them. The pretzels were okay- soft and warm but dry on the ends - and the flatbread was yummy - fresh and very garlicky.

Service was slow. Reaaaally slow. The server, &#34;A,&#34;who took care of our group with at least one other server (and a third who solely delivered drink orders), would check on half of the room and then disappear for long periods of time while our glasses went empty. When she was present, she was impossible to flag down... the coworker who booked and organized this had to go get her so we could place additional orders. (And she still didn&#39;t show for 15+ minutes after that.) As a result, a lot of people just went up to the bar and ordered their own drinks. She also didn&#39;t ask us about tabs; rather, she brought out individual checks after taking each order. Her attentiveness picked up the last 10 minutes I was there.

Bathrooms were clean. The women&#39;s had a pic of a ripped shirtless guy on the wall. Erm, aiiite...

They also had $2 mimosas  ($4 If had grand marnier added to it). $2 domestics, $3 craft beer, $4 imports on Sundays.

We were the jerks who showed up here for late lunch/early dinner on Christmas Day.  Then again, they were open regardless of whether or not we chose to eat there so I guess I can&#39;t feel too bad.  

We had just come from a movie across the street and I don&#39;t think we&#39;d eaten anything all day so we were starving.  They opened at 4, so we showed up just a few minutes after.  It was, unsurprisingly, not very crowed, though there were a handful of other tables occupied.  So I guess we weren&#39;t the only freaks that didn&#39;t have family to hang out with or that were too lazy to cook.  

I must immediately note that I LOVED the bathroom (I have a real &#34;thing&#34; for restaurant bathrooms).  It was amazing.  Check it out.  Moving on.

Since it was a high holy holiday and all, I decided to order champagne.  We also ordered the soft baked pretzel appetizer which came with three sauces in which to dip: white queso, yellow mustard, and a sriracha ranch.  

Husband ordered the &#34;southern bird&#34; and I ordered the &#34;grilled cheese and tomato soup.&#34;  Apparently, the champagne must have hit me too fast because I didn&#39;t notice on the menu that it came with proscuitto on it.  I&#39;m glad I noticed before biting into it.  So I had to scrape that off.  

So husband liked everything about his food.  

As for mine, it was good but for someone who TRIES to eat decently (if that&#39;s even possible for someone who goes out to eat kind of fairly often), I felt so gross eating it and only allowed myself to eat half of the sandwich.  Just so cheesy and greasy which I realize is obviously what a grilled cheese is. Half of it was plenty.  I did, however, enjoy what the red onion and arugula added to it.  The tomato soup was...interesting.  It didn&#39;t taste like soup to me, but more like pasta sauce in a cup.  It was very thick.  Not very &#34;soup-like&#34; at all.  It didn&#39;t taste bad, but I thought the consistency was weird.   

Overall, it was decent.  I felt bad for our poor young waiter having to work on Christmas Day but I left him a nice tip so hopefully that was of some consolation.  Who knows, maybe he was glad to be away from his family?  Oh wait, that&#39;s me.  I&#39;m sure the majority of people actually WANT to be with their blood relatives on Christmas."

I was seated right away and had a waiter stop to ask me what I wanted. They had some really good drink deals on Monday, like $3 domestic drafts, which was a nice perk. I decided to wait to order until my friend arrived. Service got more sketchy after that. There were long gaps of being attended to throughout the meal, and we could see the waiter not really doing anything. He looked past us when we would try to get his attention. It was pretty annoying...

As for the food, I got a BBQ bacon burger, and they forgot the bacon. We were able to get a plate of bacon to make up for it, so I didn&#39;t end up just paying for a cheeseburger, thankfully. The burger had good flavor. Interesting that it was in the shape of a long john donut... and I wasn&#39;t given an option on how I wanted it cooked, but it came out well done, which is fine by me. The tater tots were pretty standard issue, nothing special.

I ordered the Thai Chicken Salad...which was ok. It needed something else. I was looking for something a little cheaper and healthier, hence the reason I chose that. However, they have all sorts of meatballs, burgers, sandwiches, pizza, salmon, etc. I would like to come back and try something else. My friend got the salmon, and that looked great.

They have a nice beer list, including drafts, bottles, and cans. A few unique beers, but most I have tried/heard of. Either way you have some options, which is nice.

It was very big and very inviting. I can see it being packed on the weekends. They used sofa loves eats as booth. Cool. 

We searched yelp for a recommendation and saw the picture of the meatloaf. And someone has been craving meatloaf for the longest time. We were going to share the one meatloaf dish, but I was worried it wouldn&#39;t be enough so we ended up ordering the meatloaf and the beef tips. 

Beef tips turned out to be a great choice, but for $16 I felt like the portion could have been bigger than just 6 pieces and half a twice baked potato. Taste wise it was delish. I wanted to continue eating forever, but unfortunately had to stop at six bites. 

The meatloaf was a huge disappointment consisting of two 1/4 inches of the driest meatloaf ever. No wonder the ketchup as brought out it it. It was definitely not your homemade comfort food. Sadly. It was salty and chewy and bad all around. Good thing this was not a huge portion because we had to fight to see who would eat the last piece since it was $14."

The food was solid. I had the pork chop special, which for $15 was a very good portion of mashed potatoes (not great), onion strings (pretty good) and two thick chops in a sweet glaze. My colleague (who is completely a Bears fan) had a steak sandwich that he demolished.

Lots of TV&#39;s tuned to the game. Lots of beer specials. And lots of fattening foods. All good!"

Came here for lunch (business meeting). This place is very nice, modern and clean. It was my first time being here. I said I definitely need to come here more often for get together&#39;s.

I got a burger/sandwich (grilled chicken) with fries. He got a burger with tater tots. Food was quick to come to us. The order was mixed up I got my burger but with tater tots and he got his burger with my fries. 

I told the lady our order is not right. She said oh your fine just swap them. (she had black hair. Don&#39;t remember her name)

Are you serious?!?!? Who says that? I was turned off by this place. I will not have any more meetings here whether it be professional or just meeting with friends. Thanks Brick house on the great first impression."

However, I&#39;m disappointed in their food &amp; hope that I just landed on some poor choices. I ordered the gun show burger since I love fried eggs on anything/everything. Sadly, the gun show murdered my taste buds leaving a salty, unsavory crime scene. They cooked my burger perfectly to how I wanted it, but the burger in all its wholeness was hard to swallow after several bites. I took half the burger home in hopes that perhaps its leftover form will treat me better. (So wrong.) Then, their garlic tots were bathed in an excess of garlic that vampires within a 10 mile radius knew to stay away from that girl sitting in the window booth at Brick House with the Gun Show Booger. The tots were tasty, though! ...when I doused it in ketchup &amp; had enough water/alcohol to wash it down with. Because of how well this place is loved by my friends (who go here more for the drinks), I think I&#39;d try them again... But stay away from the gun show burger.  and garlic tots if you&#39;re on a hot date."

Hostess tried to sit the 3 of us at a booth in the back which was so dark it was ridicules so we asked to be moved further up, where there was a bunch of empty tables. Hostess seemed very annoyed with the request. The booths on the wall have TV&#39;s and the screen is inches from your face, very distracting. When I go out to eat I prefer to actually interact with the people I&#39;m with without a TV glaring right next to me. The server said they couldn&#39;t be turned off. Ordered the pretzel appetizer, which came out very hot and fresh, that was really the only decent thing we ate. The menu is kind of strange, like they don&#39;t know what direction they want to go. I was tempted to get the chicken and waffles until I saw they were chicken strips. Went for the old standby because nothing else was really jumping out at me. A bacon cheeseburger, which was mediocre at best and the funny thing is it came out without bacon - when it was added, it was rubbery . It was definitely  pre-made and most likely frozen. My two friends both ordered steak &amp; eggs (not on the menus but they made it). Both ordered eggs over easy and steaks medium. One plate the eggs were perfect, the other they were burnt to a crisp, really bad. They were returned right away and as the server is taking the plate back she says &#34; yeah I thought they looked really overdone&#34;. Well, why are you serving it?? Took almost ten minutes for a new plate. The bathrooms also need a little attention - paper towels all over the floor. Won&#39;t be back."

It&#39;s a nice place inside, more suited for game day adult fun but in a pinch bringing your kids is totally acceptable. Not sure why I thought this place was like hooters but it wasn&#39;t - or maybe that starts after hours? 
Food was decent - had the chicken and tater tots, husband had a southern sandwich. No complaints but nothing to write home about either. The service was pretty slow, but we also had 1 waiter for 30 people which was pretty dumb on their part.

The atmosphere is pretty epic. The multiple TVs playing sports and the beer bongs make it seem almost too sports bar like, but the comfy couches, fireplace and bathroom lounge give the restaurant a classier feeling. The menu has yummy finger foods as well as full platters, and even though the cost of a plate ranges from $9-$20, the food tastes fresh and comes out fast. The bar is stocked and the seasonal cocktails bring out the girly drinker in me. But there&#39;s so much beer to choose from, too! I would have given 5 stars but I find that the curtousy of the female servers fluctuate. I have been treated like a guest on multiple occasions, and treated with annoyance a few other times.

First time around I got a Moscow Mule, Zucchini Fries (curly cut &amp; fried), and a Bison Burger with tater tots.  The burger was great and I was really pleased with how it was cooked!  Our server was great and very attentive. 

Second time around my boyfriend and I went with another couple after an engagement party for some drinks and appetizers.  We received pretty decent service with very little people in there for 9 PM on a Saturday night.  The duck flatbread is AMAZING and I highly recommend it.  If you&#39;re into trying something new - just do it!  We also got the deep dish chocolate cookie sundae to share.  Make sure that you are prepared to share, as this dish is probably 4 servings. 

This last time my boyfriend and I went to watch the NCAA final four games.  Thinking it would be crowded, we went a little early and there was nobody there!  Our service was OK, but the server was not very friendly.  Her sarcasm was blunt, and while we understood it most of the time - I&#39;m sure others might not agree.  My boyfriend got the bison burger, upon my recommendations, however it was NOT what he expected.  I even tried it to see if it compared to the quality of meat that I received my first time here and it was off-tasting.  It tasted like bad meat and so he barely touched the burger.  I got the yard bird chicken sandwich - which was delightful. 

All in all, I might go back here if we can&#39;t get in anywhere else, however I was not very impressed."
brick-house-tavern-tap-downers-grove,Catherine P.,-mZAS-M-pMoNs07WuHStGg,"Schaumburg, IL",1,1,1,338,106,Zlgg9Ps2_pOuZdhz3Z-kkw,4.0,2014-09-21,"It was 2:30 in the afternoon on a Saturday and having not eaten all day, my girlfriend and I were in search for a sit down place with some good eats. We had no where to be and just wanted to kick back for a long lunch and some girl chat. I thought the Lombard/Downers Grove area had some good choices so we headed over to Butterfield and I had totally forgotten this place even existed.

I have never been here before yesterday and haven&#39;t heard much from anyone but the parking lot was pretty full and it looked like the kinda place where we could achieve our needs of food, relaxation, finding a new place, good atmosphere, and maybe a little cocky-tail. 

We walked in through the front entrance and were greeted by a very pleasant young woman. She opened the door for us and really made us feel welcome. My friend noticed they had a section of 2-seater couches set up as booths towards the back half of the dining area and the hostess kindly offered us the couches for our table. Ummmmm, yeah, that took about a second and a half to debate before saying that sounds just perfect. We were able to get a table with a TV, not that we were watching but it was nice once they changed the channel to a cooking show instead of college football per our request. Thanks, guys!!! 

Brunch was served until 4pm so we had some brunch options but nothing that particularly caught either of our eyes. I did see Deviled Eggs ($5) for an appetizer. We ordered these because they are on the lighter side and in hope we would still have room to eat our meals. The deviled eggs came out (6 halves) on a fun tray (see my photos) and were perfect for 2 hungry ladies or ideal for 3 people for a light appetizer. I also ordered Ginger Ale (cause I&#39;m an old lady like that) which was Canada Dry brand but please note... its&#39; charge is by the glass. 
 
I ordered the one thing that sounded good to me, don&#39;t ask me why because it&#39;s not something I would have normally ordered, but i got the meatloaf. It came with cheddar mashed potatoes which didn&#39;t impress me by any means and also did not seem to have anything cheddar included unless someone named &#34;Cheddar&#34; scooped them on to my plate! The two slices of meatloaf were good. The meatloaf was well seasoned but I know why they typically serve the gravy on top...it&#39;s the one thing that was nice and hot when it was served. Everything else was warm but not hot. I ended up dipping almost every bite in the mushroom gravy (containing actual slices of mushrooms and is the reason I ordered it on the side). The flavors are there, but they gotta work on food temps. My gal pal ordered the crab cake sandwich and informed me it was very good. If I liked crab, I would have tried it myself to tell you my thoughts but I did snag a bite of her bacon mac &amp; cheese which is what I recommend you should get with the meatloaf if you are looking for a hearty meal and want to either take a little nap after your meal or start sipping on one of their delicious cocktails!! 

I know you are asking yourself right now...&#34;Cath doesn&#39;t drink at lunch??&#34; Well, at this place...I do now. I read their Blackberry Collins on their cocktail menu. It is made with Tito&#39;s handmade vodka, St. Germain, soda and muddled blackberries. Since I can&#39;t just order something off the menu, I had them change out the soda for Ginger Ale. The first one was questionable so I ordered a second just to make sure it was ok...you know, for the safety of other patrons! ;)

We will definitely be back. I think there may have been a 30-something hot guy convention here yesterday afternoon. Maybe that&#39;s something they do every Saturday?"

We each got one glass of blood orange mimosas (so good!) then switched to the carafes of regular. For $10 a carafe it was a really good deal! 

For food we started with the meat and cheese plate. We then got the Chicken Cobb salad, steak salad, and the salmon Benedict. I am not a huge fish eater at all, but the salmon Benedict is my reason for writing a review. It&#39;s AMAZING!

There are things I really like about this place and some things that need improvement or that I seriously dislike. Let&#39;s start with the good.       

The food is spot on. I like to get the Philly Cheesesteak. Now, I&#39;ve never had a real one from the homeland, but from what I&#39;ve seen at other places and what I tasted here, its a pretty darn good substitute. The steak is sliced well and there&#39;s a good amount of cheese. The fries aren&#39;t my favorite but they&#39;ll do.         

Like every other restaurant these days, they have tons of craft beer on tap! And they have good specials: Sunday and Monday is $3 drafts. Holla! We had one bad experience with the draft beer that almost kept us from coming back. I realize that I&#39;m gonna sound like a total beer snob right now, but I drink a ton of craft beer. I know when it&#39;s fresh and when it&#39;s not. I also know Green Line (the beer, not the train) like the back of my hand. So when I was brought Green Line and it tasted....not right....I sent it back. Got another one and it tasted the same. My husband theorized that maybe they got the kegs mixed up or that the taps weren&#39;t clean. Either way, it was off but the waitress seemed super annoyed that I wasn&#39;t satisfied the second time. Sorry? Anyway, like I said, we gave it another shot and the beer was good this time. 

I really like how spacious the restaurant is. They spread out the furniture really well so it never feels cramped. I also like the couch/booths they have. Super comfortable. Some along the wall even have TVs so you can watch whatever you want. There&#39;s also these recliners that have a TV right in front of them, and a table so that you can eat in front of the TV and watch sports. Just like home!

Here&#39;s my problem. The decor makes me want to punch the tool that came up with it. I HATE word art on walls. Now, its only done on the ceiling and if it were something cutesy, maybe I&#39;d be okay with it but it&#39;s like a frat guy went to Michael&#39;s and got some letters and was like, &#34;Dude bro, let&#39;s put dude crap up here.&#34; So you have stuff like &#34;One tequila, two tequila, three tequila, floor.&#34; Okay, I&#39;m not sure if that specific one is up there, but you get the idea. Also, there&#39;s signs about &#34;man caves&#34; and whatnot. Which is weird, because the Brick House doesn&#39;t strike me as a male-dominated food/beer joint. Is it supposed to be? Because as my husband noted, it was pretty evenly split between guys and women. Anyway, that aside, they still have my business, but I won&#39;t be a regular."

My meal on the other hand was not good at all. I got the grilled cheese and tomato soup. The grilled cheese was ok and had bacon (which always makes things better), but the tomato soup was TERRIBLE. I honestly can&#39;t believe that it was even considered tomato soup. It had tons of cheese in it, was separated, and tasted like nothing. My mom also ordered a cup of tomato soup which was only half filled. When she inquired about it they said that that&#39;s the normal portion size, but when mine came out it was filled to the brim... Hmmmm that seems inconsistent. Maybe other things from here are good, but my meal was terrible and I do not plan on ever going again.

#7 -- Brick House Tavern &amp; Tap

If I had to prepare a David Letterman-esque &#39;Top 10&#39; list of my favorite restaurants, this place would have a spot somewhere around #7 (+/- 1).  Here&#39;s why:

~THE FOOD~
Good-to-great.  Of the five or so times I&#39;ve been here, I&#39;ve tried their deviled eggs, pretzel sticks, fish&#39;n&#39;chips, BBQ pork sandwich, and a &#39;brick&#39; burger.  Pricing was a tad on the high side, but the quality of items left no doubt in my mind.  The menus are presented on a sheet of particle board instead of the standard plasticized schtick--a cool touch that sets them apart from the rest of the pack.  Beer options are varied, and you have four size options: 16oz, 22oz, 1/2 bong (48oz), and a full bong (96oz).  The novelty of tapping your brew of choice at your own leisure is simply awesome, and the value for what you&#39;re paying isn&#39;t that bad at all.  4.5/5

~THE AMBIANCE~
Cozy.  Everything from being dimly-lit to the centrally-located fireplace to the comfy booths is a mark of the perfect night out.  The majority of the wait staff are women, and the majority of those are hot women.  On my most recent trip here, my buddies and I agreed that one particular blonde waitress was a perfect 10.  It was difficult not to stare, actually; she was that unbelievably gorgeous.  Still, though, they used to have skimpier outfits (jean skirts and button up tops)--what happened to those?  :(   5/5

~THE BOTTOM LINE~
While I wouldn&#39;t think twice about bringing a girl here on a date, where Brick House really shines is in catering to manliness.  The abundance of TV&#39;s, the selection of beer in large quantities, the cute (sometimes smokin&#39; hot) wait staff....the overall experience of coming here is highly enjoyable.

Definitely would recommend, even to random strangers on the street."

Waitress was friendly and attentive. Food was just ok for me. My wife and I ordered the duck wraps for appetizer. They were decent but the portion was very small. They give you 5 lettuce wraps with the plate but only enough duck to fill mabye three, and that&#39;s really stretching it. Wife ordered fish and chips for dinner, I had mahi sandwich. Fish and chips were very good, fish battered nicely,crunchy but not greasy. My mahi sandwich tasted like a frozen patty, pretty bland although the cucumbers that come inside the sandwich did give it some flavor. Fries were good. Overall it was an adequate experience but I probably wouldn&#39;t need to come back.."

Finally a date got me here.  At first, when I walked in, the place seemed huge or spacey.  As I walked in i noticed it is more like a Chill place, dim lighting, occasional tables here and there.  Although, I did enjoy the atmosphere.  This place seems to attracts lots of business group meetings of some sort.  At least the night I went, there was a group of professional men in business suits.

The food was good, we got a pizza to share and it was filling, not very heavy but enough to fill you up.  I wouldn&#39;t mind going back for a big juicy burger!"

I didn&#39;t take a photo of the plate before I started but it was a mess.  Fries underneath with three fish fillets stacked on top.  There was a lot of the fried batter crispies under the whole mess.  OK, so the aesthetics were &#34;meh&#34;.  Unfortunately, the taste quotient didn&#39;t live up to the signature label.  This was &#34;meh&#34; as well.  
Service wasn&#39;t stellar either but it wasn&#39;t the bartenders fault.  She was the only one on duty filling drink orders  for table servers and bar patrons alike.  Management should staff the bar area more adequately for the after work crowd.

Recently visited Brickhouse again with a large group. Many items ordered including burgers, salads, and wings.

Tried the duck wings and they were very tasty. Never had duck legs prepared like chicken wings and they did not disappoint. They sauce was very good!

We shared an order of calamari. Nothing special or unique about them but tasty nonetheless.

I ordered the chopped chicken salad. Again nothing special about it. I can barely remember what was in it. But it did it&#39;s job.

The fiancé ordered a double bison burger. That candied bacon was delicious. Prepared well and came with tots. I think I enjoyed tasting his meal better than my own. I guess that&#39;s what I get for getting a salad at a place like this.

I did really enjoy my drink. I had the Woodford Peach Manhattan. Sweet and tasty. A lot of the cocktails sounded really good and had we stayed longer I would&#39;ve liked to try a few more. They also had plenty of beer options and a variety of sizes.

The space was nice. Half the tables had couches as it&#39;s seats.  The other half were regular tables and chairs that were more suitable for large groups. They also had a private party room for larger groups.

Overall, food was decent. Drinks were good. Good for groups."

I love the pretzel sticks and if I get something that comes with fries, I order them cajun because I love cajun seasoning.

It comes with 3 different types of dips.  They were very good.  

Our entrees arrived within a reasonable amount of time. Sandwiches are large. My husband got the turkey club with fries.  The restaurant has a lot of little touches that add to the experience.  For instance, the turkey club sandwich came with 2 deviled egg halves on the plate.  Nice, just a little something extra.

I ordered the prosciutto wrapped meat loaf with gravy and cheddar mashed potatoes.  It was fantastic.  The plate had 2 slices of meatloaf that appeared to have been grilled to give them a crispy crust.  Yum!  It was topped with a mound of onion straws.

Only if it is golf or you walk from the hotel to a high calorie/high fat dinner. However, I had know idea that meatloaf served over buttery cheesy mashed potatoes topped with batter-fried onions could taste so good. This was not mamas beef meatloaf. This had pork sausage beef and prosciutto wrapped around this. The spicy ketchup infused in this plate was just the right heat. I don&#39;t like heat i like taste. This had all that.

1ST VISIT: While clearly out to dinner with my then-boyfriend (now-husband), the female server all but sat in his lap and barely paid any attention to me. I get it, I&#39;m a lucky girl, but if you want a tip, it&#39;s &#34;hands-off&#34;. I don&#39;t remember what my food was, but it was nothing impressive and we left in a hurry.

2ND VISIT: This was probably four years later, for lunch this time and with a coworker. It&#39;s so perfectly located to my place of employment that I was hoping for a much better experience. I&#39;ll stop hoping now. We both ordered the same turkey sandwich with a few amendments. Coworker: no bacon or mayo. Me: ranch on the side. My coworker got no bacon, with extra mayo. I also received no bacon, no ranch, and gobs and gobs of fat. Re-thinking this experience makes me sick to the stomach. It was as-if all the fat off this turkey was literally carved into a sandwich and handed to me. Absolutely, 100% disgusting. In fairness, our server did bring over the manager, but it was so late into the meal that I accepted the comped meal and left hungry."

I enjoy the brick house in the Skokie area better but they&#39;re all pretty much the same. I ordered chicken and waffles and it was deeeeelicious! The two waffles were made so perfect they were crispy on the outside and soft in the inside. I was just slightly discouraged because for $13.50 my chicken and waffles were supposed to come with grilled bananas, 2 waffles, chicken tender strips, and fresh strawberries. It came with everything but the grilled bananas. Oh well I guess.

My mimosa was $8 and tasted really good with peach schnapps in it

My friend ordered the same I had and he enjoyed it. My other friend ordered the fried chicken Benedict and enjoyed that. My boyfriend ordered the Greek meatballs which was very tasty and he also ordered fish and chips which he raved about the entire time.

Beer selection is good, and you can order it in multiple sizes, the largest being a mini tapper tube that sits on your table! If you can all agree on the same beer to drink this is a good option!

The place is attached to a gas station, but has it&#39;s own entrance also.  It has a few tables between the entrance and the gas station shopping side.  I walked up to the counter to see the menu and order.  There was no own around and after a minute or 2 wait, i walk back to the gas station where I had seen somebody wiping down a table when I walked in.  This person was gone, so I returned to the counter and called out.  3 workers in there late teens to early 20&#39;s appeared from the back.  

I ordered a BBQ/bacon burger and got is with the fries and drink to go.  I was asked how I wanted the burger cooked and replied medium rare.  The one female working began by putting a bun one the grill top and then put a burger patty on too.  She took the bun off after it had grill marks and put it on the work area.  She let the burger sit on the grill and the grease from it caused the fire to rise up and engulf the burger.  After watching this for a minute or so, I complained saying I wanted the burger medium rare not burned on the outside.  The guy who took my order stepped in and said it was to get grill mark on the burger.  Okay, that I don&#39;t mind, but check out the pictures to see if that was what I got (sorry can&#39;t find how to upload the photos I took of the meal).  He removed the burger from the grill and then steamed it on the flat top with water and a cover.  

The female cooked the fries and the onion ring for the burger.  When she finished and was packing up the fries, she dropped a 1/3rd of them on the floor.  She didn&#39;t even flinch or offer to cook more, just put what was left in the bag.  With the burger and fries in the bag, she put them on the counter and said here is your stuff.  I said it wasn&#39;t done.  The guy then said, it is your order.  I said it is missing my drink.  The female walked over to the fountain without asking what flavor I wanted.  She finally turned around to ask and I said Coke but no ice please.  She immediately picks up the ice scoop and puts ice in the glass.  I repeated my request and finally got it the way I ordered it.  

I took the burger home to eat.  The burger was cooked well on the outside (burned by the fire) and brown not pink on the inside.  It was a decent portion, but was not very good.  The onion ring was hard and crispy and the fries were good but missing the rest on the floor of the restaurant.  

The customer service experience was horrible.  Nobody out front when I arrived.  Not paying attention to the food cooking or listening to the order.  A 4th person arrived and appeared to be the manger/owner&#39;s son.  While he joked with the staff, he was counting the money in the register.  He ignored the exchanges by the workers with me and no one apologized for the delay or quality of the food."

The burgers are made fresh and I highly suggest you call to order ahead and make sure they are open. The classic cheeseburger with jalepenos well done was delicious. Burgers are really thick, pickle slices on bottom, topped with cheese, tomato, and onion. Fries are pretty delicious!

This is a small little storefront, no room to sit and stay. There was something strange about the store front... it had a little shelving unit with about 3 small cookies wrapped up on it,  some spices, a book about wood fired cooking, and then a real small fridge that had an open bottle of wine, one can of pop and like two bottles of water. There just wasn&#39;t much of anything going on there, and the place didn&#39;t smell like pizza either. 

I ordered online, and indicated so when I walked in. The girl never asked me for my name to match the order (I must&#39;ve been the only one!), and told me it&#39;d be 5 minutes. I did get the pizzas in that 5 minute time frame and was on my way. It dawned on me on the way home how she didn&#39;t verify my name, and I got nervous I&#39;d have the wrong pizza, but it was correct when I got home.

I ordered their veggie pizza- zucchini, peppers, tomatoes, and my guy got pulled chicken, bacon and giardinera. My pizza was very good, but compared to my guy&#39;s, it was looking pretty sad and lackluster! (totally my fault!) His looked way better... and tasted way better too! I&#39;d say go for more when ordering! They do charge per extra ingredient (plain cheese is an $8 base price). Overall we were satisfied with the pizza- good sauce, chewy and crispy crust, and we got leftovers from it too. I&#39;d order again if in the area."

She made all three of us feel rather uncomfortable with her more or less cold demeanor. She didn&#39;t make eye contact with any of us the entire time we were in there. She grabbed our pizzas from the kitchen, set them down on the counter, looked at my Dad&#39;s hand for his money, and blindly handed him back his change without so much as a farewell. She did ask us to call and let them know what we thought of the pizza, though.

The pizzas were about as limp as the service. Literally.

As we drove to the park, we made conversation about the less than stellar customer service, but we were still excited about the pizzas. We got to the park and picked a spot to sit before diving in and opening our boxes.

On first glance, the pizzas looked good. They weren&#39;t cut properly, though, so we had to rip at the dough to get the individual pieces separated.

As we all took our first bites, there was no moment of excitement or satisfaction. We were all quiet, trying to figure out exactly why this pizza was... disappointing.

I believe that the pizza&#39;s biggest problem was the crust. The edges were SO doughy and practically inedible. The dough itself lacks any good flavor. It felt like eating a Dominos pizzas, which isn&#39;t what I expected from a place like this. Despite the edge&#39;s thickness and chewiness, the crust on the bottom of the pizza was paper thin. Honestly, it was barely thicker than card stock.

There was no crisp to the pizza at all. When I held the pizza by the crust&#39;s edge, the entire slice flopped downward and just looked bad. It wasn&#39;t flopping down because of the size of the slice. It was flopping down because the crust was SO thin and closer to raw and doughy. It wasn&#39;t actually raw, but it wasn&#39;t cooked in a pleasant way.

The sauce was very tomato-y. It wasn&#39;t bad, but it was very reminiscent of a can of tomato sauce, rather than a delicious homemade pizza sauce. The cheese was by far the best part of the pizza. I ordered fresh mozzarella on my pizza and it definitely tasted good, but it still wasn&#39;t even close to the best cheese I&#39;ve tasted on a pizza.

So, with the crust, you have an underside that is incredibly thin and floppy and an edge that is thick, chewy, and doughy. That means that you wolf down the slice itself, but then feel unable to eat the edges. The only reason we kept eating our pizzas was because we were so hungry. Even after we each completed our entire pizza, we looked at each other and all thought, &#34;I&#39;m still hungry.&#34;

There&#39;s just no substance to the pizza at all. The only filling part comes from the crust&#39;s edge, but it&#39;s so flavorless and bland that you don&#39;t want to eat it.

We were so looking forward to this pizza, but we ended up feeling incredibly disappointed. We were lured in by all the nice reviews on Yelp, but we think that since this is a newer place, most of these reviews are faked in order to create a false impression. I haven&#39;t logged in to my Yelp account in years, but eating this pizza made me want to dust it off and let other people know that it just isn&#39;t worth it.

From the service to the pizza itself, everything was lacking. I was excited by this concept, but I can&#39;t imagine that it&#39;s going to be in business for long. Save yourself the money and buy a frozen pizza."

I called their number, and this lady was very pleasant on the phone... Took our order, said it will be ready for pick up in 15 minutes... Explained that she will take the Groupon voucher and not to worry at all... 

I was like... Wow .... Love love the customer service!!! 

We ordered Fig and Goat also Sausage Pizza.... Both were very good!!!

Not greasy at all.... Each pizza is good for 1-2 people.
It was perfect for me and my BF coz it was relatively thin 11 inch pizzas...


Will definitely order again!!!"

Not worth the worry!  The pizza was very good!!  Perfect topping to sauce to cheese ratio.  Very flavorful crust.  

We had Fig and Goat - perfect flavor.  Not cheesy or gooey at all.

The Pit was full of flavor.  The chicken was moist and the crust was crisp.

My dad picked up the pizza and said the ladies were very friendly and the customer service was wonderful.  They showed a genuine compassion of wanting to know the quality of their work.  Great job, keep it up, we will be back."

Anyhow, I LOVE pizza in many of its forms: NY Style, Deep Dish, Sicilian, Chicago style, and even that cracker-crust stuff they serve down in St. Louis.  I can even make a pretty damn good pie with my own two hands. Did I mention I love pizza? 

I moved to Chicago almost three years ago, and I&#39;ve eaten quite a bit of good (and not so good) pizza. Spice It Up is probably the best take-out pizza I&#39;ve had since I moved here.  The crust is nice and chewy, and perfectly cooked - obviously kissed by the wood fire but not burnt.  The toppings were high quality, and the cheese we selected (mozzarella with shaved parm) was delicious. 

If there are any downsides, its that it&#39;s not close enough to my house, and its a little more expensive than your average pizza (but this is not average pizza). Also, their menu is limited to pizza, it would be nice if they served salads or other appetizers to go with their excellent pizza."

Forget about trying to have any conversation while waiting for you food.  Even our waitress needed to yell her welcoming spiel in order to be heard over the din!
Now don&#39;t take my review the wrong way.  I have been to Egg Harbor before during off hours and during the week and I&#39;ve never experienced the loud din that was there today.  The food is very good, and I will most likely go back again, just not when it is crowded!

Found this place thru Yelp and it did not disappoint.

It has a parking lot but it was packed (probably cuz it was the day after Xmas).  After one circle around, found a spot.

There were crowds of people waiting and I considered leaving, when another patron said the wait was only 5-10 minutes.  For a party of 2, the wait was more like 3 minutes. Yay!

We were led through a busy restaurant, filled with families.  In fact, we were the only people in the room where we were seated without children at the table.  Obviously, a great restaurant for accommodating families.

At the table was a pitcher of water with lemon, waiting for us.  Awesome.  We ordered a couple of orange juices, as well.

I had the Market Fresh Eggs Benedict and husband had the San Antonio Skillet.
Market Fresh Eggs Benedict-baby spinach, mushrooms, tomatoes, artichoke on an English muffin with poached eggs and basil hollandaise sauce.  Yum!   Came with crispy potatoes, too.  Very filling.  A meal without the English muffins (yep, I scraped off the top when I started getting full).
San Antonio Skillet-chorizo, bacon, jalapeño, tomato, eggs, pepper jack cheese &amp; potatoes. Delicious and very spicy.  I could only eat a few bites , but liked it.

Great breakfast joint and service was fast, friendly and high energy."

Aztec omelette was ok. It&#39;s nothing special. I wanted egg more soften and smooth on my tongue. My husband had San Antonio skillet which was good with a little bit of amount, but it&#39;s way too spicy. If I had it, I would have finished it.

I was curious big iced tea, a lady next table ordered and sweets menus such as French toast and pancake. It looked delicious."

And to say Naperville has a shortage of vegan restaurants would be an understatement. But I digress.

My friend and I wanted to enjoy breakfast out before I had to drop her off at the train station. Egg Harbor has the distinct advantage of being situated downtown. Also, they have a fruit cup, potatoes and dry toast (make sure you order without butter -- in fact, I ordered mine without butter and it came with, so I had to send it back) that are totally vegan. Not a single breakfast entree is vegan (not even the oatmeal), but that is about par for course for all of the Naperville-area breakfast-serving establishments that I looked at.

So, if you don&#39;t mind getting a selection of sides (which also helps if you can&#39;t decide if you want sweet or savory, you can get a little of both!) this isn&#39;t a bad choice for vegans."

upon arrival the place was jam packed.  I found my way to the hostess stand put my name in and was greeted very kindly, given a pager and told the wait would be around 30 minutes if that&#39;s OK. Being new to the area I figured ill wait and take in the scene. I walked outside and noticed how everybody else waiting was enjoying the day.  Parents with children coming from church, young couples, old coupled, just a good community mix.
Nobody seemed mindful of the wait and being it was Sunday it&#39;s to be expected.  When my pager went off I proceed to the stand and again was greeted with a smile and seated right away. My server Tony appeared instantly asked if he could get me something to drink and did, also fast and friendly.  The table already had a pitcher of water on it, so that&#39;s a plus.  I ordered the Aztec omelette and requested no potatoes and muffin which is what it comes with. I asked Tony if I could just get a side of bacon instead. No problem.  Food came fast and here&#39;s the miss.. it was good but not over the top good. The omelette I had at Yolk downtown Chicago was better. The bacon was skinny and I looked at the menu, 4 pieces for around 5 bucks..
However the atmosphere and friendly service made me not mind.  When I was done, Tony brought me the check even took time to chat about football and wished me a great day.
For how busy it was I was impressed with the service a happy attitude as nobody seemed flustered and all employees seem happy to serve the guests. The food was good but I honestly expected better. Having said that I will return as the menu has a lot to offer.

I found out that they  over charge me by almost 2 dollars.  And never got I&#39;m sorry or anything.  They were more worried about showing the girl the right button on the computer to push.

I got I think it was called the down home which was biscuits and gravy with eggs and hash browns and a side of crispy bacon. They hit spot on, gravy was very flavorful, with little bits of sausage in there, biscuits were perfect size and fluffy, eggs cooked to a perfect over medium (I hate over easy and when I order over medium at most places, they always give me over easy so I send it back, not this time! Yay!) and the bacon was thick and delicious! And cooked to crispy made it even better, bonus it didn&#39;t taste like it had been sitting out for a while either like most places. My boyfriend got the eggs Benedict which he said was perfect, he loved the hollandaise and said the eggs were perfectly poached, clean plates! And our waitress was Ashley, super friendly girl.

Your meal comes out with special stickers to let you know that you weren&#39;t just tossed in with all the other orders.
They have a separate menu with loads of choices. Toast, cinnamon rolls, pancakes, and the list keeps going. Depending on the day, they often have a GF soup option too!

Today, my in-laws were in town to celebrate my wife&#39;s graduation; and we all went out to lunch today to celebrate Mother&#39;s Day before we would part ways and my in-laws return home.

But, the experience for us at Egg Harbor today was horrible for various reasons:

1.     The wait was over an hour, a bit longer than the estimate given.

2.     Second, there was not enough silverware and cups placed for the six family members.

3.     Third, not only was there residual food marks on some of the plates (you know, those white glass instruments that restaurants put food on to serve their customers. Forgive me, Yelp reader, if I insult your intelligence with such a statement; I may have mistakenly found it necessary to give a reminder of what a plate is because of the amnesia incurred because Egg Harbor took soo looonngg to actually bring our plates of food out. If there is any offense, Yelp reader, please credit it all to Egg Harbor), but there was residual food on some of the cups as well.

4.     Fourth--It needs its own bullet point--the wait to actually get our food was sooooo loooonggg. It took an hour.

5.     Fifth, after the soooo looonngggg wait for our food that may have caused amnesia on &#34;what is dishware,&#34; the food (eggs, hasbrowns, etc.) was cold!

6.     Finally, probably the worst thing about Egg Harbor&#39;s service was that they did not take the initiative to offer a discount. Only after my father-in-law asked for a discount did they offer a 10% discount, for service that could not be justified as being even average. I was thinking at least a 30-50% discount would have been more appropriate.

I will only give one caveat: This extremely poor service may have been due to the busyness of Mother&#39;s Day. There were a lot of people there. But, I think it was certainly still Egg Harbor&#39;s fault in taking too many customers and offering horrible service to at least our table (and I would not be surprised if this was the case for many other tables; the manager said that the cook was quite backed up on tables).

So, in conclusion: at the very least, do NOT go to the Naperville, IL Egg Harbor location on Mother&#39;s Day and other holidays. Maybe they are better on less busy days, but I have no reason to have any hope in this. I would suggest going to another Egg Harbor location like Wheaton, IL (where I have had only good experiences), or just find another brunch place near Naperville. Thanks for listening, Yelp reader. And, Egg Harbor Naperville Location, please take this as an honest review with good intentions. Maybe one day you will regain my trust that you can fulfill your commitment in offering an adequate brunch experience to celebrate another celebration one day."

As for the food, my wife did her usual gluten free breakfast, but I decided to venture into the unknown and try something from the lunch menu. California Tuna Melt sounded delicious, but personally the tuna was a little runny. I finished it though and savored every bite. 

Overall, if we&#39;re ever in the area, Egg Harbor Cafe will always be at the top of our list."

I approached egg harbor with a cautious eye knowing that breakfast was gonna cost me $15. And well, I am cheap, I mean frugal.  
Let me tell you sister, it was worth it.  I had the uncreatively named &#34;protein wrap&#34;. It was eqg whites, spinach and shrooms with cheese.  It tasted like the tortilla was house made. Even the shrooms taste magically delicious. 
The coffee is better than Starbucks, and that&#39;s saying a lot. 
I am a tough grader, but they did it all right.  
Service was top notch. And please tip generously at breakfast. They work their ass off and 20% seems too little."

Egg Harbour Cafe is by far my favorite place for breakfast in the Western suburbs.  This is the only restaurant where I will order pancakes, which are delicious. They always have interesting specials which tempt me, such as different types of French toast. I have had a couple of sandwiches off of the lunch menu which were very impressive. You can get potato pancakes on the side. I almost forgot to mention the flavored coffees.  Like many breakfast nooks, rooster images are all over the place.

The coffee was good, a local brew. Delicious!

I had the gluten-free pancakes. The &#34;shorter stack&#34; was three large pancakes! Wowsers! It also came with four links and two eggs any style. Plus endless coffee and a pitcher of lemon-infused water, and my meal came to under $15 including tax. Great deal!

We had a limited menu filled some Egg Harbor classics. Everything was wonderful and flavorful, and service was super fast (not surprising given the small crowd).

I never would have thought about hosting a private event here, but after the success of this party, I would absolutely consider it."

Normally we go to the barrington or Arlington heights locations and always have amazing food and service, but this location was horrible. The hostess was the only great part about our visit. She was very nice and seated us right away, but our server was horrid. Took way too long to just greet our table! Was not hiding the fact he did not want to be there. Finally came and took our drink order and again we waited for what felt like forever for him to come back and take our food orders. When we finally placed that, yet again took forever to receive our food and when the food came it was more than disappointing. Portions were much different compared to other locations, and quality was not the same. English muffins were burnt, so we&#39;re the potatoes. My sisters crepes were pathetic looking. Our server was no where to be found throughout the meal, thankfully we stuck with water after our drinks were empty because if we wanted a refill we would have been out of luck! Will never go back to this location!!! So not happy about this visit ..extremely disappointing."

I got a green pepper and feta omelette and they just put cold feta crumbles on top of a plain omelette with a few green peppers in it. Also my daughters meal was $8 off the kids menu and all she got was 1 (one) single pancake and a tiny cup of chocolate milk. This place is ok but it&#39;s expensive for what you get.

My mom and I came in at 1:15, sat down, ordered. Service was really slow. Looked like because my server was cleaning before her shift is over. Well, my favorite dish came out looking really sad. My potatoes were not fully cooked, my salad was soggy, and the grilled cheese was cold and greasy. In all of my 15 years of coming to Egg Harbor Cafe no matter what location I have never had this happen..now vomes the time to pay. The young girl asked how everything was. First of all I didnt have everything on the menu, so I dont know how everything on the menu tastes. You should of asked how my meal was. I told her it was the worst I have ever eaten here and all I got was an oh our bad. Not coming here for a long time. This place has too many teenagers working here who act like they are here just to make a buck. I miss the old servers who really cared about this place. I havent seen them in a while.

I ordered the farmers market benedict, and it was as terrific as I always wish benedicts at other restaurants were, but never are. You know the Original Pancake House? This place is what I wish OPH was. 

The coffee is delicious Intelligencia, and they offered to send some with us to go at the end of our meal--how cool is that?! Our server, Tammy, was delightful and accurate, even though we arrived close to closing time (and I&#39;m assuming she&#39;d been on all day, but I don&#39;t know this for sure). The food came out quickly, which I especially appreciated after waiting until 1:00 to go out to breakfast (and then waiting 30 minutes for a table).

I would chalk up a bad visit or two to &#39;things happen&#39;, but I&#39;ve yet to have a bad experience here.

The pancakes were excellent and eggs cooked perfectly to order! A lot of times when you get something like blueberry topping for pancakes, it is just a goopy, sugar mess.

I tried my friend&#39;s gluten free pancake and I couldn&#39;t believe how delicious it was! 

The service was fantastic, by the way, and I wish I remember the name of the server (a tall young 20&#39;s blonde woman). i wish I had an Egg Harbor near me because everything about this place, from the seating, atmosphere, service and food were just what I was hoping for."

I followed the advice of fellow Yelpers and called ahead to get my name on the wait list. It was perfect timing; we were seated right away.

The space was smaller than I expected from seeing the exterior. However, the smaller space made it feel all the more cozy; the decor (and aroma of breakfast!) definitely added to that as well. I was a little concerned at first because the hostess looked bored and sad when she led us to our table, but our server, Sarah, was very friendly, answered all my questions, and promptly brought a carafe of Intelligentsia coffee to our table (as well as a to-go cup on our way out!).

I ordered the banana bread french toast which was divine, although larger portions would be warmly welcomed, and my sister got the skillet with 284562 types of meat (because she&#39;s a growing girl with the fastest metabolism in the world) which tasted like a delicious heart attack, especially with hot sauce. We shared our food with each other and left perfectly satisfied with just enough room for a sweet treat.

And the best thing about brunch is that you get the deliciousness of breakfast without the grogginess and stress of preparing and eating at 7am before having a full schedule waiting for you :)"

This one, the one in Downer&#39;s Grove, and Lake Geneva. I&#39;ll give them an A for consistency, but that doesn&#39;t translate well when every time and every place has been just so &#34;meh,&#34; forgettable. I have friends that rant and rave about it but I don&#39;t understand the appeal.

For me, I don&#39;t do sweets for breakfast so pancakes, waffles, crapes, you won&#39;t hear a thing from me about that side of the menu. Maybe that&#39;s where all the hype comes from? Anyway, I&#39;ve dug myself into their skillets and egg breakfasts and after trying a few, I just think they are average at best. The way I see it is that I think about where they chose to build their restaurants, pretty well off neighborhoods and downtown areas. I see their menu as pandering to the area residents by digging into their pockets. The food is not worth the price. It&#39;s good but I can pay less at other breakfast places and get much better quality. Service is average. I usually get condescending looks and mediocre service possibly because I look like a college kid so maybe they don&#39;t expect a good tip. 

I&#39;m not at all attracted to the decor. The pictures and windows and other such decorations are new, but bought with the intent to look old and homey. It&#39;s just an eclectic mess that just seems like they&#39;re trying too hard and not accomplishing a homey feel. I feel a little like I&#39;m nit picking now and really I always believe that good food can outshine all faults in a restaurant. For Egg Harbor tho, it&#39;s just average, boring, and the same food you can get if you drove 5 minutes to the next breakfast joint, but that next place is probably cheaper."

But I mostly want to write about my most recent visit. I received a coupon for $3 off my order if I used the rapid pick-up option.  I ordered online and asked for my food to be ready at 3. It wasn&#39;t ready until 3:07 or so. I checked my bag to make sure I had everything before I left, and I noticed they didn&#39;t add my side (a fruit cup). I asked the cashier and she said they were out of fruit cups, except for just watermelon cups. I ended up taking one of those, but I don&#39;t think it was worth the extra $1.25. If i hadn&#39;t checked my bag before I left I wouldn&#39;t have gotten a side at all!

The first sandwich was also soggy and greasy. When we took it out of its bag, it was smushed. Not a pleasant sight. The second sandwich was not quite as bad but it too was soggy. We are very unhappy with this experience. They get two stars because the order was correct this time. And we were lucky it tasted okay too.

The ambience is always very warm and cozy, often having a fireplace or something similar to bring warmth to the dining area.  There is usually also a separate back room with more tables that I believe can be used for private functions.  This separated dining area is nice though as it gives a sense of privacy to those who want to enjoy a more quiet meal.  While having a coffee or smoothie, I also feel comfortable enough staying afterwards in the dining areas for completing computer work and casual &#34;business&#34; meetings, of course always remembering to kindly &#34;wrap it up&#34; once the busy lunch period begins.

My go to entree is the Chicken Caesar Salad, or other salad, with an apple.  So healthy and delicious.  I sometimes get a sandwich paired with a soup, but more often then not I stick with the salads since they are very fresh tasting.  I also purchase muffins and breads when I am early, and they are always fresh and moist. 

I enjoy how the food is served on regular dishware.  This gives the entire feel to the restaurant a more upscale flavor.  The appeal is not just for local employees grabbing a bite to eat, but also for families, groups, and those with young kids.  The kids menu is simple although I do feel that it is a bit on the expensive side.

This Panera specifically has easy parking in the lot, very efficient service at the registers, and clean tables and restrooms.  I have been here during all hours from early morning to late-night, and the service and food are always consistently very very good no matter how busy they may get.  

Overall, Panera serves delicious quality meals in an inviting atmosphere.  It&#39;s no wonder that they continue to remain busy year after year!   When it comes to sophisticated fast casual, Panera definitely is the gold standard that to this day is hard to beat.  Keep up the good work!"

Is it convenient? Yes. Is it the ideal situation for a lunch date or spot to get some work done? Probably not. Let me explain...

I&#39;ve been here numerous times just like I&#39;ve been to other Panera locations plenty of times. While the food at this Naperville location is just as tasty as any other Panera, the ambience is really lack luster.

For one, every time I come here it is PACKED. Packed with kids, moms, professionals, teens, ugh everyone and their mother. If the noise from patrons isn&#39;t enough, you&#39;ve got the employees talking extremely loud and singing and shouting out to one another. I mean, I&#39;m all for having fun in the work place, but this was pretty ridiculous. Especially for a spot with free wifi and comfy tables perfectly suited for those wanting to enjoy a meal and relax or get some work done.

The restaurant itself isn&#39;t always the cleanest either. The last couple times I&#39;ve been there so many tables were full of crumbs, leftover napkins, etc. So maybe tidy up a bit throughout the day - thanks.

Of course, I have no complaints about the food itself. Like I said, pretty standard to every other Panera I&#39;ve been too. I really enjoy the you-pick-two deal. I&#39;ve had a handful of different items, but these are some of my favorites I highly suggest:

-- Broccoli cheddar soup
-- Chicken noodle soup
-- Chipotle chicken panini
-- Chicken cesar salad
-- Steak and blue cheese salad
-- Power chicken hummus bowl
-- Iced green tea
-- Asiago cheese bagel"

I have to say that I dont like taking my food to go when I go to this location because my orders have been wrong on seperate occasions. One time I asked for a salad with chicken, I got home and there was no chicken. I called and a manager asked for my address and said that she would mail me coupons. I never got them. On another occasion I was not given a side of buttered noodles for my daughter. 
Tonight I dined at the location and everything was fine.  Service was good, food was great and we beat the dinner time rush. My only complaint was that the restaurant was very cold. I ate with my coat on as, did other patrons.  Other than that it was a good experience.
I must add I bought a cheese danish to go, it is gross. Took one bite and spit it out. Pass on the cheese danish."

Ordered 1full fontega sandwich, 1 bowl of broccoli cheese soup, &amp; 1 full smokehouse turkey panini, 2 drinks and 1 cookie. $33...fine, whatever. They call our name &amp; we are given 1/2 fontega &amp; a cup of cold soup, &amp; a cold panini. I immediately go up to the girl who took the order and complained. She said she would have her manager take care of it right away. 45 minutes later, NOTHING! So as we are leaving, I go up to her and ask, &#39;did your manager pull the receipt? Because we want the difference back&#39;. She said her manager was suppose to come to the table...so she goes and grabs her manager (extremely rude person) &amp; she comes waddling up, saying &#39;ok so tell me what your problem is&#39;. Right then and there I wanted to record how this person was speaking to us. She kept swiping her greasy hair out of her face and whistling while we were talking! Are you serious?! So then I asked, &#39;why haven&#39;t you come to our table? We&#39;ve complained twice now and nothing has been done&#39;. She said &#39;I heard someone mention something to me, but go ahead and explain it&#39;. Are you joking?! So, turns out our order should have only been $22 and some change!!!!!!! I was sooooooo not having it. They offered to make another half sandwich when we were already late for our show!!! I said no way, I want the difference back. And Kelley (manager) had the audacity to complain about having to find the check number from the receipt!!! 

We got the difference back and right before leaving (as she wipes her nose) she says &#39;next time make sure you complain before you sit down and eat&#39;. BY THEN I WAS FUMING!!! WE COMPLAINED BEFORE WE EVEN SAT DOWN!!!!!!!!!! &amp; because she is a horrible manager, she totally disregarded what her employee told her to resolve the issue!

Never EVER going back"

It wasn&#39;t until today that I wanted to really review the place because of my great experience.
So I had to get boxes of coffee for an important work function where we had some really important guests coming. I ran to Dunkin Donuts and, lo and behold, it was closed since they were reopening in a new location. Of course, the day I needed coffee quick. Now running later, I rushed into Panera hoping for some quick coffee boxes. Kelly helped me and provided really excellent customer service. I think Kelly could probably sense my panic or nervousness, reassuring me that the coffee would be ready shortly, seeing if I needed anything else, and offering me a cup for coffee while I waited. It was a really nice gesture that helped calm me down and recenter. I then got my coffee and everything all packaged up nicely and made it back to work with a few minutes to spare.
 Thanks, Kelly and everyone at the store!"

After some Naperville Family Chiropractic action close by I was hungry for some nunch but wanted to keep it healthy. Lately I&#39;m liking Panera&#39;s hidden &#34;power salads.&#34; Well they&#39;re not so hidden now with at least the Chicken Hummus Power Bowl advertised as you walk in the store...advertised in, I swear, a you-pick-two combo with the new chicken chili. So I go in and order that combo. Manager Man tells me that that particular salad doesn&#39;t go in the you-pick-2 so do I want the whole salad and a cup of soup? No. Do I want a drink? No. Aside from extra calories, Panera is already &#39;spensive for what it is (a bunch of spinach leaves and 3 oz of chicken for $8), I don&#39;t want to make them richer by ordering a $2+ drink. Bump that.

So I get my salad and it looks nice but it didn&#39;t taste like any others of the same salad I&#39;ve had at other locations. The hummus was missing something. The whole thing was really bland, like it needed salt. Plus they didn&#39;t give me my two oil packets that (I think) normally come with this salad. I had to axe for &#39;em."

I ordered the tomato &amp; mozzarella panini, like usual, but my sandwich was off when it came to the cheese:tomato:bread ratio.  The cheese wasn&#39;t completed melted, as it always should be in a panini, either.

One of the cashiers had a classic case of elementary school &#34;staring problem.&#34;  There wasn&#39;t anything on my face, and I was looking above her head at the menu, and she wasn&#39;t even waiting on me.  It made my check-out awkward.  Although my food was ready quickly, and no wonder the cheese wasn&#39;t properly melted, the woman behind the food counter reminded me of a grumpy lunch lady.

The perk to this Panera, though, is that you can use their small conference room for free.  I haven&#39;t seen this in any other location.  The only bummer is the sign stated you have to have a minimum of 15 people.  This would be ideal for larger book clubs or even AA meetings.  However, our small group of 4 on a conference call, could&#39;ve really used the room that night.  Instead I saw 2-3 women leisurely sitting around in there.

And, per the usual setting on 95th Street, there are a lot of high school kids in here."

I usually get tomato soup and Greek salad to go but this time we decided to eat their. When ordering I learned they were out of tomato soup and I had no idea what else to get so I ordered broccoli cheddar soup. I&#39;m sure it was fine but I didn&#39;t go their for that. Then when I got my salad they put the dressing on it and not on the side, I didn&#39;t know that because they put it in the side when to go. They put way more on then I would have and totally ruined it for me. It was just a bad start to my Saturday night. Once my girlfriend finish her food we went to Chipotle across the street, the place I originally wanted to go, then my night started to get better."

I had a very bad experience at panera, showplace drive in naperville.  We went around 9:15 PM last saturday after watching a movie. They said they had a very busy day.   We ordered 1 Med Veggie Sandwich for my wife and I did the pick 2 with frontega bread, broc ched soup and bread.  First they said, they ran out of the bread for frontega and they will substitute for a difference bread that looks the same but with cheese on it, I said Ok.  When they were making the sandwich, they realized that they did have the original frontega bread and they made the sandwich.  We took the order to go.  At home, we found out that the veggie sandwich was less than half size and not the whole sandwich. That was the first strike.  Then, wife takes the first bite, there was chicken in the veggie sandwich. My wife is a vegetarian.  And according to her religion and culture, she cannot eat any meat at all. What the hell !!!  So, less than half a veggie sandwich and chicken in the sandwich.  I have photos to prove the size and the chicken in the sandwich.

Then I look at my order, it is the tiniest piece of frontega bread ever. I have been eating the same pick 2 for more than 5-6 years now and i have never seen the frontega bread half that was so tiny.  I saw that the girl who was making the sandwich said that she found 1 remaining piece of frontega and she made with that. But if it is so small, why make it with that.  

This is the worst experience that I ever had at Panera.  Panera better fix this issue. I know lot of high school kids are working at that place but looks like they have been very poorly trained.  At 9:15 PM, they were cleaning up the kitchen to close it down when they should be doing it until close to 10 PM.  Very disorderly and worst food experience at Panera. And this place is not clean at all. When I see them cleaning the kitchen and then making the sandwich, yuck, I lost my appetite too."

I always get the pick 2. My favorites on the menu are the frontega chicken sandwich, bbq chicken salad and broccoli and cheddar soup. My mom claims that Panera has the best coffee!

Maybe it&#39;s just because I&#39;m vegetarian?

I&#39;ve had most of their vegetarian options. I&#39;m not a fan of any of their soups, and they&#39;re too bland for me. Their salads are okay. I&#39;ve ordered the Thai salad and the Strawberry Poppyseed salad, both minus chicken. Every time I&#39;ve gotten it, it&#39;s had chicken. They&#39;re more than willing to remake it, but it&#39;s still an inconvenience. 

My all time favorite sandwich is the Mediterranean veggie. It has a nice balance of chilanto spread, feta, and veggies. I love the tomato basil bread it&#39;s on as well. I&#39;ve had the tomato mozzarella panini, and it&#39;s way too greasy for me.

With this Panera specifically, make sure you don&#39;t come during the lunch or dinner rush. The line gets pretty long, and it can take forever to get your food."

I got my Italian combo right away and found a booth. Imagine that! The sandwich was not as good as I remember it. In fact it was a little dry. I am still not sure why they would ask me if I wanted a bag of chips or a piece of bread? It comes on french bread. Why would I want more? Then this couple sat in front of me with no food, but toting their laptops. I don&#39;t mind when I can find a seat. But it burns me up when the place is full of people not eating and you have to stand there with your tray like your in high school.

The problem they live in Plainfield &amp; we live in Chicago.  The solution find something near the midpoint.  We decided on Thai food so I started a search on Yelp.  I found several Thai restaurants in the target area that were highly rated on Yelp and fell near the midpoint.  We went to Thai First (4 1/2 stars) in Downers Grove. 

The restaurant has a nice decor, but the food and service were very inconsistent.  We ordered several dishes and got separate plates so we could eat family style and try multiple dishes.  We got the Cashew chicken w/vegetables, Eggplant &amp; Vegetables w/chicken, some udder dish w/chow fun &amp; Red Sea Salmon.  The first 3 dishes were nothing special with very little differentiation in flavors.  The Red Sea Salmon was very good with an assortment of vegetables in Panang sauce topped w/crispy basil leaves &amp; roasted peanuts.  They serve tea in individual pots, but the water was lukewarm not hot the way tea should be served.

The server was a very nice lady, but the service was very inconsistent.  (To her defense she was the only waitress &amp; there were quite a few tables).  She brought 2 dishes of the 4 while we waited for the other 2 none of which had no serving utensils.  She brought the 3rd dish and said she misplaced the Salmon order so we started with the 3 we had while they reordered this dish.  We asked her for water several times before she finally brought it out.  
 
The serving sizes were kind of small, the food was nothing special and the service wasn&#39;t very good.  Will I be going back? (28 miles) Probably not, especially when I live in Chicago and there are so many better more options much closer to home."

I did ask for spicy when I ordered and our server brought me a pot with ground chili in it so I did add some spice but it was easily some of the best I have had. The crab rangoons were incredible. I didnt know what I was missing until I tried these so make sure you order them. My co worker ordered the Basil Dynamite and it looked great too. Comes with ground chicken and different colored peppers. She said is was a mild level of spicy. 

The service here is also very good. I wish I lived closer becuase I would eat here all the time!"

Ordered the Rama Tofu and my partner ordered the Pad Thai, both were good and decent (if not slighly smallish) portion. Place is clean and fairly intimate, nicely decorated. Also had some sort of dessert served in banana leaf, it was the special so I do not recall the name and that was good too.

Worth a try, if in the area!"

My husband and I came here recently for dinner on a Friday night. It wasn&#39;t busy, and there appeared to be two staff members working: a younger guy running dishes who may have been working the kitchen or maybe just expediting, and an older female waitress who seemed to maybe be the manager/owner. 

We chose a quiet table in the corner, and the guy gave us waters and menus. A minute or two later, the waitress came over and immediately started babbling - no greeting, just started talking half-incoherently at us. She berated the guy for not giving us drink menus, and when we told her we just wanted water, she tried to push us to order something off the drink menu, even though we told her we didn&#39;t want any beer/wine. She also talked down to us about our table location - &#34;can&#39;t have you over here in the corner!&#34; - even though we had chosen it ourselves for its location.

We ordered food: crab rangoon as a starter, and pad thai with tofu and panang curry with chicken. There are two options for panang here: one has rice, and one has noodles. My husband wanted the one with rice. The waitress was very rude, trying to pressure my husband into changing his mind to the noodles: &#34;Ohhh you&#39;ll love our noodles! We&#39;re the only one who does them like this - they&#39;re half crispy, half soft - are you SURE you don&#39;t want them?!&#34; When he confirmed he wanted rice for the third time, she started fake pouting as if offended. She later had to come back to ask again what meat he wanted because she &#34;got so distracted by the noodles.&#34;

The crab rangoon were really good - large and flavorful. The entrees were just ok. The tofu and noodles in the pad thai were both softer than I like, and my husband said the panang curry tasted like a generic curry. But, we knew were spoiled by our favorite super-authentic spot in the city, so we adjusted our expectations. We couldn&#39;t get over our waitress, though. She didn&#39;t seem very concerned with customer experience. She talked at us, not to us; pushed back and whined about our choices; and generally seemed more concerned with hearing herself talk out loud than with serving customers. She tried to push a special soy sauce on the table next to us, and we heard the customer say no at least 3 or 4 times before the waitress gave up. 

Overall, we may order from here again, but it will be for takeout only, not dine in. We couldn&#39;t wait to leave."

The crab rangoons and Thai iced tea were delicious. The wife and I agreed on that. I personally loved the Tom Yum soup, but my wife didn&#39;t like the tomato flavor.

It&#39;s really hard to find authentic Thai food in America.  The closest you will get is Thai town in LA.  I really wanted to like this place because I miss my moms cooking and she&#39;s so far away... Sadly, it didn&#39;t live up to my expectations.

First and foremost, the ambiance is nice.  But, that&#39;s really about it.  I gave two stars because the service was decent but the food was not.  The Thai food is Americanized Thai.  I ordered the chicken pad see ew and it was super salty.  I literally felt like they poured in like a whopping pound of salt into the dish.  My husband ordered some basil beef stir fry and it was super sweet and salty.  Our tom yum soup was also super salty and tasteless.  Food is super salty and the flavors were nonexistent.

The food is superb. I devoured my red curry twice in a row, and on my third run I went with the pad Thai. Both dishes were awesome. 

Great environment, too. Even if the Buddha was presumably against statues of himself (which one can read into should one read the Dhammapada), it gives off a nice feel of ambience in the low-lit room. 

So they&#39;re three for three in my book.

No cooking skill just mindless order schlepping..
Pad Thai tastes like a dirty wok. 
Spring roll tastes like refrigerator. Spring roll sauce way to strong.
Chicken satay good but too much oil and peanut sauce was mute on flavor. 
Me: I&#39;m used to the old Thai restaurants around Hubbard &amp; State St. Down Town 
Granted, many are long gone but they knew Thai. Pad Thai has always been my benchmark and this was another fail like many before. Real Pad Thai is fresh and flavorful with the noodles staying white, never ever a brown greasy burned oil leaden heavy handed ball of stomach churning glop. Even asked for little oil..

After returning from 3 weeks in Thailand last year, I have been on a mission to find delicious and authentic Thai food in the Chicago area. I finally found it at Thai First!

The food is fresh and amazing! We tried the chicken panang curry (best I&#39;ve ever had), chicken pad thai (amazing), shrimp fried rice (out of this world), basil fried rice, pad se ew, crab rangoons, papaya salad (took me back to Thailand!), and the mango sticky rice (better than Thailand).

I&#39;m pretty sure I embarrassed my family because I was making so many noises while eating this food and couldn&#39;t stop raving about it throughout the meal. It&#39;s the only Thai place in the area opened on Monday and we were fortunate to find it while searching for dinner options on Yelp. 

Service was also fantastic! The owner is the sweetest and she served us. She was so passionate about using fresh, high quality ingredients to make delicious and healthy food. She asked for feedback and we told her not to change anything! It was probably one of the best meals I&#39;ve had this year.

The atmosphere and the ambiance of the dining area allowed for a great relaxed conversation, which made the dining experience that much more enjoyable. The first waitress that sat us down was very kind and accommodating. My friend is very sensitive to spicy food, so the waitress actually allowed my friend to taste the sauce of the my friend&#39;s chosen entree that was being used to see if the spiciness was appropriate. The waitress also mentioned that if it was too spicy that it was possible to add more coconut milk to reduce the spiciness - kudos on the extra attention on the customer service. My friend eventually changed her mind completely and went with the Pepper Steak instead. I personally went with the Chicken Yellow Curry. We also ordered potstickers for an appetizer.

The potstickers came out crisp but not too crispy, just the way I like it. The sauce tasted a little different from your typical gyoza/potsticker sauce, and I&#39;m glad they just didn&#39;t use a simple soy sauce based sauce that a lot of other lazy restaurants tend to do. I couldn&#39;t quite put my finger on it, but it was just different which, again, I enjoyed. It&#39;s not hard to mess up potstickers, and they came through.

I wasn&#39;t able to taste the Pepper Steak, but I could hear the &#34;crunch&#34; of the carrots and bell peppers, showing how fresh the vegetables were. I thought the yellow curry was great - their mix of the tang of the curry with the smoothness of the coconut milk was just right for me. I personally like the carrots and the potatoes to be cooked a little longer so they absorb the curry a little more, but I enjoyed it the way they were prepared nonetheless. They did the curry right. 

The second waitress that came up to us, Cynthia, was very friendly and very sociable. She did her typical &#34;How is the food? How is your night going?&#34; routine, but also made real conversation with us. We had some good laughs together (all of us were laughing pretty good), which showed us how much they cared about the customers having a great time. Thai is already one of my favorite foods, so I&#39;ll be sure to bring all my friends to this place whenever a Thai craving comes on."

appetizers were great.  unique flavoring on the crab rangoon, and the potstickers and sauce were fantastic.

coworker loved their yellow curry but was disappointed that the oil in the sauce started to separate while she was eating it. 

had the basil dynamite chicken.  i very clearly asked for the spice level to be mild, I&#39;m guessing next time i need to specify no spice at all because it was almost unpalatable.  which was a shame because the actual flavors were amazing.

no delivery def pulls a star from their rating."

The Mr. had tofu panang curry and I had tofu massaman curry -- both were outstanding! Everything was fresh and perfectly seasoned, and portions are on the generous side (I have leftovers, he doesn&#39;t). 

We started with crispy tofu, which was not very crispy but still tasty. Next time, we&#39;re going to skip the starter and save room for dessert. The server and owner were both attentive, friendly, and welcoming. Everything was reasonably priced, too. 

Sounds like their liquor license is coming soon (Sept), and that the menu (at least desserts) changes based on seasonal availability, which is great! Very pleasant night out in DG."

We were welcomed by a pleasant staff and received excellent service all night. The dining room was not large , but not cramped either. The decor was pleasant  and the restaurant was clean and tidy.
We started with chicken satay and spring rolls. The spring roll was fresh and tasty. Chicken Satay had a slightly crisp outside with a nice juicy interior (perfect).
We then moved on to the entree. Chicken Pad Thai was one of the best we&#39;ve had and the peanut sauce was very good as well. Panang Curry was a little spicy just as it should be and I&#39;ll be ordering it again. All in all a great experience and we recommend if you enjoy Thai food do yourself a favor and try Thai First.

Mongolian beef: Excellent flavor and the meat was a really great quality. Just enough spiciness.

Massaman curry: I like sweet curry and this one did not dissapoint. There was a generous amount of sauce for your rice too.

Shu mai: The sauce was really delicious. The dumplings were crispy and great!

As soon as we walked in, we immediately noticed how nice the interior was. Very updated and sleek. We were quickly and warmly greeted by the owner who was our server. She was extremely nice and attentive during our meal. We ordered Crab Rangoon, chicken Pad Thai, and Pad See Ewe. Our food came out fast and nicely presented. More importantly, everything was delicious! We were blown away by the freshness of the food. It was great to hear the owner talk about how much passion she has for cooking with fresh ingredients. She also asked us if we had any suggestions on how she could improve our experience. You can tell she really cares about her customers and that she wants you to walk away feeling happy and satisfied. I think the only downside to Thai First is the price. It is a bit steep as compared to other Thai places around the area. But the flavor and quality of the food makes up for it. 
Overall, Thai First is a great place for Thai. I will definitely be returning. As John S. Has stated in his review, Thai First is promising. Service and food are both on point. What more could you ask for?"

Time of my visit: Lunch

It has been quite awhile since I have been to this place.  Maybe 8 years or so...  As soon as I walked in, I remembered why it has been that long...

I got to the order counter and looked at the menu.  The two people behind it were busy doing something else.  I took another quick glance at the menu, while they were talking.  I could not decided, but stepped up and asked what came with the sandwich (i.e. was there a deal or just a sandwich).  I was told it was just a sandwich.  The guy&#39;s demeanor was very annoyed by a customer&#39;s presence.  I ended up ordering Italian sub.  I also took chips and drink with that.  Total came under $9.

I was honestly expecting larger size sub.  The bread was nothing special, the cuts tasted about what you&#39;d get at the chain grocery store.  Maybe I am missing something, but I don&#39;t understand why people are raving about this place.  The sandwich was about as average as you&#39;d get at a deli in the supermarket...

Also, I was not a fan of the sitting arrangement.  I am not big on communal dinning.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, if communal dinning is a part of the experience, than I get it, but this was not the case.

I chose ice tea for drink and it did not taste fresh...  The tea tasted like it was out a day or two.

Overall, it was a C experience, average."

There isn&#39;t much to this place at all, in fact I think it looks like an old school donut shop. But don&#39;t judge a book by its cover! If you&#39;re like me you know the best food comes from the most unlikely places and Shane&#39;s is not the exception. This is a true no-frills sandwich shop that focuses on the food and that&#39;s it.

When you enter you have really nowhere else to go but right up to the counter to order your meal. The menu, hung high behind the counter, provides guidance but the staff is helpful with answering any questions as well. I went with a classic Italian sub and man was it GOOD! The flavors and the combo of toppings was dynamite. I will say that I wish it was a bit larger, I tend to have a larger than normal appetite, but the price is such that I think I&#39;ll just pick up two next time.

This is a solid place that makes we wish I worked more close by so I could get an opportunity to sample the whole menu. Oh well, looks like I have a lot of weekend runs in my future!"

The service was AWFUL, we will be back because the food was good, but we will know from now on that we can&#39;t expect much for service. The teenager taking our order was quiet, and very straightforward, no pleasantries, just took our order. The teenager that cashed us out was extremely rude; first of all, we ordered a kids meal, and this being our first time, we didn&#39;t know the meal came with chips and a drink, so when we ordered a drink for ourselves, he put the kids cup on the tray, we questioned it and he wasn&#39;t happy about that. Again, we didn&#39;t know the meal came with a drink. Next, they collect payment on an iPad, very modern and cool. What the cashier failed to mention was that you have to select credit, he let us get all the way through the process and have the card decline and THEN mention it has to be credit, so I had to start all over again. 

Overall, the first impression was not a good one. Luckily the food was a saving grace."

It looked very out of place compared to everything else we saw.  Most of the area eateries were bistros or pubs or some other trendy name.  This was a plain glass windows box with tables inside, outside and a order counter.  It was apparent that this place was about straight up function--it was a sandwich place.

At first we thought the service was slow, until we realized that the two guys toiling behind the counter had a massive to-go order they were trying to get out the door.  

Because of time constraints we got our sandwiches to go.  The sandwiches were well wrapped because about 15 minutes later, we were delighted with what we found.  I had ordered a BLT--it was great--tons of B!  Bread was toasted and still warm--but not limp.  My friend had the Reuben, it was still hot.Both sandwiches were tasty."

I&#39;m glad Yelp lead me to Shane&#39;s and it might be my Plan A next time! I ordered the steak and cheese grinder and my husband ordered the Roger Grinder. The steak and cheese was just what I was in the mood for but I liked the lingering taste the roger left. I&#39;d say I equally enjoyed both. I think next time I&#39;d order extra meat because there was a lot of bread but not as much meat. They do use Boar&#39;s head here which I love, so that could be why I wanted more of it.

Since it was a nice day out, we headed out to the outdoor dining. I like that there&#39;s a ton of indoor and outdoor seating, so you aren&#39;t forced to take it to go because you can&#39;t find a spot to sit. At lunch time on a Sunday, they were pretty busy but there was still a ton of room.

The two guys that waited on us were really nice and our food was ready relatively quickly. It cost about $20 for two sandwiches, a cookie, a drink and potato salad, which was fair for what we got."

Do not love the SERVICE. The kids working here put in minimal effort when it comes to pleasantries. That&#39;s fine, whatever, just know you&#39;re not going to go far in life with a subpar attitude.

But you know what really grinds my gears about this place? They THROW the sandwiches at you. They don&#39;t place them. They don&#39;t hand them. They throw them at you. It&#39;s not a fast ball coming at you, but not once has someone put a sandwich on the counter like a normal human being. It&#39;s always being tossed or throw and then messes up my food. Seriously. A hot sandwich is not meant to be thrown. My cheeses and meats are all over the place when I open it up and then I have to reconstruct it myself. This is wrong. This is very very wrong.

Seriously good sandwiches. Really, seriously good. It&#39;s quality all the way.

Lisa had  the Club Salsalito, thought it was a little Zesty (in a great way) and I had a terrific Italian, great bread and just the right amount of fixings.

The owner, someone said Shane and he looked,  was nice,  he didn&#39;t seem to talk much,  but it&#39;s a sandwich so I don&#39;t care how employees treat me.   So, if someone telling you that they have been waiting their whole life to service you is important,  this isn&#39;t the place.  If you want a decent sandwich for $10, don&#39;t miss it.

It was also quite a few years ago and I couldn&#39;t remember much about my prior visits. I decided to give them another go.

I decided to try the Club Salsalito sandwich, which is Salsalito turkey, bacon, cheddar, lettuce, tomato, chipotle mayonnaise on multi-grain toast. Paired with a bottle of water, my total came out to $8.12. I took a seat inside and waited for my order. 

First thing I noticed were that most of the vacant tables weren&#39;t wiped down. The floor was terribly sticky and there were lunch remnants scattered about (napkins, bread crusts and crumbs, etc). It was pretty disgusting; I&#39;ve seen Denny&#39;s and Subway&#39;s cleaner than this. It seemed much of the filth is still leftover from the Cock Robin days. 

My order was ready about 5 minutes later. I opened the paper wrapped sandwich and at first glance, I was pretty disappointed. The sandwich looked tiny and I had a feeling I was going to leave hungry. I immediately wish I had ordered a side or a bag of chips.

Well, looks are deceiving my friends. I ate half and suddenly realized I was full. And the sandwich was pretty damn good; much better than expected. The chipotle mayo had a nice kick to it and the Salsalito turkey was delicious. I&#39;ve never experienced before but I&#39;m certainly a fan now. And of course, you can&#39;t go wrong with bacon and cheddar cheese. At first I wondered why they&#39;d use such a bland cheese on this sandwich, but I realized anything other than cheddar would overshadow the turkey. 

You can also build your own sandwich if you so desire. For sides, you can choose between soups, salads, pasta salads, coleslaw, and potato salads. 

Overall, not a bad place to grab a quality sandwich. If the weather is nice, take it outside or to-go. Eating inside could ruin your appetite."

I went on a Saturday afternoon around 2 PM.  There was no wait at the time and the service was quick.  I tried the Atomic Turkey Panini.  It comes with Turkey, lots of honey mustard, tomato, cucumber and american cheese on a nice ciabatta roll.  The texture was good with a nice crunch to the bread.  The flavor was just ok.  It looked like it should taste so much better, but it didn&#39;t.  
The turkey was bland, the mustard was too plentiful and the cheese didn&#39;t add much flavor.  I liked the idea of a cucumber on a panini; it added some freshness.  Overall, the Atomic Turkey was sub-atomic.  
I also tasted my girlfriend&#39;s beef sandwich...that&#39;s about all I can say about that.  

All in all, nice location, quick service, but not much flavor or originality.  Maybe Wheatonites have just not been exposed to good sandwiches available across Chicago..."

I got &#34;The Combo&#34;- turkey, ham, roast beef, cheddar, Swiss, mustard and mayo.  Sounds delish, right?  Sadly, not so.  There was a minuscule amount of meat and cheese, an unripe tomato, and some iceberg lettuce.  I actually thought I had gotten the wrong order because I couldn&#39;t see the roast beef or turkey at first.  I had to take the sandwich apart to see that it was actually there.

For $5.99, which I think is a decent price, I got a decent sandwich- not terrible, but definitely not great either.  I won&#39;t be going back.  There are lots of other places to eat in Wheaton and this was just a big disappointment."

So if you love restaurants that have to be forced to remove yoga mat materials from their sandwiches look elsewhere. 

Here you will find sandwiches made with passion. Don&#39;t expect your order competed in two seconds, they are going to make it right. So far, I have been astounded by the two selections I&#39;ve made on recent visits. The Cuban was really delicious: it combined pork, ham, and swiss with a couple pickles on top. Everything was in just the right proportions to explode with flavor. Similarly, the Atomic Turkey Panini was a big success. Ok, I heard the name and I assumed &#39;muy caliente&#39;, but it ended up being just the opposite...sweet. Surprisingly, I loved how the turkey and sweet mustard&#39;s flavors fit together. Thus, making my experiences at Shane&#39;s 2-for-2. 

Finally, you cannot talk about Shane&#39;s without mentioning its building. Straight of 1950s Americana, the building is small, simple and mostly transparent as a results of its large windows. These buildings are so rare, yet I don&#39;t know why. The feel here was relaxed and friendly.

My wife got a turkey sandwich, and I got a Reuben. We shared a cup of Tomato Florentine soup. I didn&#39;t taste my wife&#39;s sandwich, but dang, my Reuben was good. Rye, sauerkraut, thousand island dressing, and corned beef -- there wasn&#39;t too much of a single ingredient, and the grilled sandwich tasted more than the sum of its parts.

The tomato soup was hot and fresh. The pasta was cooked perfectly and as a whole the soup tasted bright and fresh. Happily for us, they gave us an ample supply of crackers. I would gladly come back to try other things on their menu."

I had the special of the day:  peppercorn turkey, green peppers, pepper jack cheese, lettuce and tomato.  Not too bad.  I&#39;m not a huge deli fan to begin with but I was pleased with sandwich.

I have never been disappointed and would choose to get a sandwich here over any other general sandwich place. Atomic Turkey is my jam and I get it about 90% of the time. The deli meat is fantastic since it&#39;s Boars Head. The warm sandwiches do take a few minutes to make, but it is well worth the wait. I&#39;d also recommend checking out their Chili. It&#39;s not hot(spicy) but has a good flavor and I&#39;ll get a small bowl every once in awhile. The building is nothing special and probably hasn&#39;t changed since it was built. Nothing wrong with that! Plus there is outdoor seating when it&#39;s nice out. The place can fill up fast around lunch in the summer so if all the spots are taken you can walk over to the park just around the corner or go check out Dry City brewery which allows you to bring in food"

If you are crazing a tasty sandwich made just the way you like it then you need to stop by Shane&#39;s!

My rating is more based on the place itself. This is one of the dirtiest places I have ever been in to eat. If you look up on the ceiling there are stains everywhere, some of the ceiling tiles are caving in. These are very cheap to replace and they are disgusting to see while ordering food. Then if you actually look around the walls and tiles are gross. The wall tiles near the fountain drink area have not been cleaned in ages. And even worse, if you look at the wall tiles near the sink where they wash the dishes used for food, you will see that they are grimy and disgusting. 
I did used to go here for lunch meat, but now I go to Mariano&#39;s. I just can&#39;t stand seeing how dirty everything is in this restaurant."

I ordered the veggie panini, sans sprouts and onions, and the tomatoes were fantastic, everything was grilled to perfection (cucumber, tomatoes, cheese, red peppers), and the honey mustard sauce was SO good. It was also fairly large, so I could save half for later. Since it was a large order, we did the &#34;brown bag&#34; catering option, so for $7.25 we all got a sandwich, bag of chips, and a really soft homemade cookie. mmmmm.

Everyone&#39;s sandwiches looked and smelled fantastic, so I will be back for sure to grab something the next time I get a break in my day and can head over that way."

They are very busy around lunch which of course with food this good how would they not be.

Cold sandwiches: range from $4 (veggie sub) - $6 (caprese with prosciutto). Grilled sandwiches/paninis/grinders are around $5 - try the veggie panini.

Great choices - hot and cold sandwich offerings.  Yummy soups, great chili.  Prices are reasonable, and the staff is a lot of fun.

Only recommendation - don&#39;t go here for lunch on days when Wheaton schools have half days, the line will probably be out the door - or call ahead with your order so you can be in and out faster.

One thing that has just bugged the heck out of me lately has been the service. I get the same guy who takes my order every time and I have not once seen an ounce of enthusiasm in him. These places have the potential to feel like a real family experience and if I were the business owner I would not want him to be the first face people see when they come in. With that said the people running the registers are normally very kind. 

Overall though this place serves one of the best sandwiches I have had in Chicago and is well worth the lines! Don&#39;t forget to try their Havarti cheese on your turkey sandwich :)."

All the sandwiches here are great and so are the people who work here.  They have kids meals as well which include a sandwich or hot dog, chips and a drink.  

This is located in the Old Cock Robin restaurant at the corner of Wesley and Hale Streets.  There is a lot for parking, but at lunch time it can be crowded.

Most orders are to go, so there&#39;s always plenty of room to eat inside.  The inside could be nicer, that&#39;s the reason I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  There are a few outside tables and when the weather is nice, it&#39;s tricky to snag one, but well worth the wait."

I had a tostada (al pastor) and gordita (carne asada), and each of them were served piping hot and were delicious. Next time I&#39;ll check out their tacos. Incidentally, this place is a casual as it gets. Paper towel rolls on the tables for napkins - you get the idea.

If I had an extra 10 minutes I might consider driving up to North Avenue to the Villa Park Fruit Market. I like it just a little bit better. But trust me, you could do a lot worse than this place if you&#39;re hungry on Roosevelt Rd."

It&#39;s no longer La Tiendita, it&#39;s now La Rosita Food Market y Taqueria. I know......who the heck is Rosita right? Well I don&#39;t know but baby girl went in there and changed errrrything in the store. Except the workers, they&#39;re all still there.

The tacos have gotten better in the taqueria. Still inexpensive which is always a good thing and they still carry my favorite sauce, Yucateco. If you don&#39;t know what that is, please, educate yourself (http://www.elyucateco.com).

They also added this new sauce at the deli which is made with Habanero and Oh. Em. Gee. if you&#39;re lucky enough to visit when they have it, I suggest you get it. Caution: It&#39;s HOT! 

The chicharrones are now apart from the carnitas (I&#39;m guessing too many people were eating them with out paying) so you have to order them from the carnicero (meat man). Of course I order Chicharrones all the time. Cut them up, add that habanero sauce, put &#39;em on a tortilla and call it one of the best tacos you&#39;ll ever have. You&#39;re welcome. ;)

La Rosita carries all the Jarrito flavors you can imagine AND they have cidral and Sangria. 

The minimum for a credit card purchase is still $10, but I&#39;m sure we can all manage to spend that. 

I still feel like some of their items are way over priced, hence the 4 star rating and not a 5. Maybe they can work on that a bit.

Overall, one can tell that the owners have tried to think of every detail to make every customer&#39;s experience one to remember. 

I was visiting family in the area and had a taste for Mexican. Being this far out in the &#39;burbs, I was, honestly, a bit skeptical about eating here. However, I was delightfully surprised at every aspect of Taco Madre.

* FOOD: We had tortas (steak), enchiladas (veggie), fried ice cream, margaritas, and Lagunitas. DELICIOUS. One usually doesn&#39;t say this about Mexican food, but it was plated in an aesthetically-pleasing way. The textures were complementary and the flavors were bold. 

* SERVICE: Everyone was SMILING!! I&#39;m a happy person, and eating makes me happier. The staff here was attentive, professional, and courteous. 

* ATMOSPHERE: There was an energy in the restaurant that started with the staff. People genuinely seemed happy to work here. Their enthusiasm rubbed off on the patrons. 

* PRICE: Reasonable. Taco Madre is worth every penny you&#39;ll spend. But don&#39;t misunderstand. It&#39;s not expensive--at all. In my opinion, Taco Madre is a steal at its price-point.

* COMMUNITY: I&#39;m always excited to support places that give back. Taco Madre actively supports local and national causes. They believe in being part of the community--not just a restaurant. 

I can&#39;t wait to visit my family again so we can try more on the menu--like the chilengo taco that seems to be really popular. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll find some new favorites."

Well Taco Madre is apparently a &#34;two-off,&#34; with an, I&#39;m assuming successful, Montgomery location. They&#39;ve done nice things with the former OMG space: corrugated aluminum trim, a nice paint job, dark wood tables and a modern color scheme.

And they crank out whatever the hell you order fast! Jr. chicken burrito on visit one was tasty and a good size for $5. I just wish the shredded cheese was melted up in it. Chilango taco was bangin&#39;, what with its chopped steak, chorizo, melted cheese, grilled onions and other goodies.

Visit two today I got a mahi mahi taco, the best of the three, and a steak and another chilango taco. Ringing in at $9, the prices are a little steep, but it&#39;s quality you won&#39;t find at some more authentic taquerias around Aurora. 

Complimentary chips and (warm!) salsa is a nice touch. The chips are meh though. Their homemade salsas shine, however, and do try the avocado one prepared on weekends only. Red is spicy and smoky and my favorite."

The chips and salsa are amazing as well, you can tell they are homemade. DEFINITELY will be going back for those shrimp tacos &amp; chips and salsa soon!!"

I finally had the opportunity to visit on a Sunday at around 6 pm. 

My very first impression was not good, as I discovered that they were out of margaritas. At a Mexican restaurant? Say it ain&#39;t so! Anyway, the lady was very friendly and apologetic, and ended up comping us an order of guac, so all was forgiven.

Our order included chilango, ground beef and carnitas tacos, and all were excellent. The guac was good, but a little too much lime for my taste. The chips were also good, with a nice salty corn flavor. The salsa had a deep, earthy, tomato and roasted pepper richness and wasn&#39;t too spicy. The chicken quesadilla was also good, and loaded with cheese. The &#34;hot&#34; (red) hot sauce was also very good, with deep pepper flavor, some kick, but not overly hot.

My kids wanted to try the fried ice cream for dessert and it did not disappoint. The vanilla ice cream ball was the size of a softball, coated in crunchy sweetness and sitting on top of fried dough, drizzled with chocolate and caramel, and topped with whipped cream and a cherry...fabulous stuff.

Welcome to the neighborhood, Taco Madre! If I get my margarita next time, you just might earn a fifth star."

Taqeurias close to my home are &#34;ok&#34; but Taco Madre so far is elevating that to my new addiction.   Steak Burrito has a premium steak option and the meat is pretty good.  Al pastor tacos are very good as well ... Dress them up both styles (you&#39;ll see when you try it out)...and I very much recommend you do!
Has basic but sufficient seating, a drive thru (a plus) and some outdoor seating as well.  Two nights in a row... That does say it all.

Also great customer service!!"

I was really surprised by the feel of the restaurant when I walked in. The music and smell that came out of the kitchen instantly grabbed my attention. I have been to the other two locations in the past (both equally good), but this one had a nice modern feel to it. I just happen to be in there when they were trying out a new menu item (chile relleno taco and shrimp al pastor). I felt great that the owner valued my opinion. It was AMAZING!! The servers checked in with me and made sure that everything was good (even with the other tables being full). I&#39;ve been to other local Mexican restaurants in the area. Some weren&#39;t bad, but this one has real authentic food. I recommend the steak tacos and the chicken enchiladas. I&#39;ll definitely be back. It was worth the 30 minute drive."

From the road, you would think this place is just another fast food Mexican place.  It old be argued that it is but I would put these tacos up against any place in the loop of Chicago.  My wife ordered enchiladas with two types of Mole sauces.  One was a bit spicy for her but she kept on eating it because it was so good.  I ordered three tacos with three different meats.  I wanted to stop to take left overs home but couldn&#39;t resist.  My only complaint was the price of beer was too high.  Best to order the food to go and enjoy your favorite beverage at home."

First off the rice was so flavorless, not good. And then I had a grilled chicken taco, the chicken was dry and tasted like it had been reheated. Which I love chicken and rice. The only reason for the 2 stars is because of the steak taco, which was the only good thing about the whole meal. 2 tacos and a side of rice, almost $8. And then with the drive thru they must expect some kind of tip, sorry not from me. Do I have to leave a tip when I go thru the McDonalds drive thru?

We&#39;ve been on the hunt for Ramen for a few months, and this was the first of the restaurants we chose to try. 

She was a Ramen expert, while myself - a novice. I&#39;ve doctored up my fair share of the $.10 Ramen packets in the past, but I&#39;ve never had true Ramen at a Japanese restaurant.

To start out with - this place is SUPER cute. It&#39;s still a small restaurant in a strip mall and fairly &#34;dive-y&#34;, but the interior is cute, the bar is neat, and the decor is nice - far better than expected. The service is great - one server for the room on a Wednesday for dinner, but the room was so small, I couldn&#39;t see you needing more.

We decided to get a few rolls, because it said that all Chef&#39;s rolls were 40% off...if you paid in cash...and ordered no less than two. Lots of stipulations (how you paid, what you ordered, how much you ordered), but it was still worth it. Since we went full on an ordered Ramen, I figured we should pick some very American rolls - so the cream cheesey Mexican roll and Tempura Dragon Roll we went with. Both were fantastic. I can&#39;t fathom paying full price (somewhere around $14), but they were absolutely delicious.

But you guys. The Ramen. The stuff I was here for! SO GOOD. The bowl is HUGE - definitely enough for at least one meal. I don&#39;t love pork, nor pork belly, so I wasn&#39;t thrilled that it was featured in every bowl, but I&#39;m told that is normal for Ramen. We both ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen. Loads of noodles, veggies, etc. Everything I expected. And the broth! It was thick and delicious. After a few bites, I realized it did need a bit of a kick, so I added a good amount of hot sauce, which helped. Because I clearly couldn&#39;t finish everything, I took the remainder home (they put it in two containers - noodles in one, broth in another), and a few days later, it was just as tasty.

The only reason I&#39;m knocking a star is due to the &#34;pay in cash&#34; note. The website (and the server) clearly states that it&#39;s 40% off the rolls only, if you pay in cash. You don&#39;t get 40% off your entire bill. So, I planned to pay the rolls in cash - not the entire bill. I don&#39;t carry a lot of cash, so when we were abruptly asked at the end of the meal if we were to pay all in cash, we had to say yes and pay the entire amount. I wasn&#39;t prepared but thankfully cleaned out the wallet with enough to spare for a tip. I think the &#34;cash only&#34; disclaimer needs to be cleared up - otherwise, fantastic meal!"

It&#39;s located near Crosstown in a strip mall next to a pawn shop.  The rolls are expensive and not very impressive.

Fried Scallops $10 - These were A-OK.  The scallops were a nice size, but didn&#39;t have much of a flavor.
Shoyu Ramen $10 - I was in the mood for noodle soup, but it was pretty boring.
Cubs Roll $14
Grand Canyon Roll $14"

Not every Japanese restaurant has ramen available, so it&#39;s exciting when I find a new place. I decided to check out Yamado the other day because it has great reviews. 

Unfortunately, their ramen is beyond boring. I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen. The broth had no taste at all. I actually thought they had made a mistake and brought me an unfinished bowl. It was basically hot water. I was glad to see that they had some bottles of soy sauce at the table. I wouldn&#39;t typically add something like soy sauce to ramen, as it is already chalk full of salt, but I was desperate for some sort of flavor. Ramen is typically very attractive looking when served. The contents of the ramen at Yamado looked as if they were just dumped in the bowl. Not to mention there was hardly anything in the bowl. Barely any noodles or pork (you know, the good stuff). I almost felt cheated. I paid $13.95 for &#34;premium ramen&#34; that I could have made at home for way less money and with way more flavor.

I can&#39;t speak for Yamado&#39;s sushi, only their ramen. This negative review is only directed at the quality of their ramen. The atmosphere was nice. It&#39;s a cute place and I was served very quickly. I wouldn&#39;t recommend Yamado if you&#39;re looking for good ramen, but perhaps their sushi is better."

I have been coming here for 10+ years and enjoy it every time I go! I don&#39;t understand why this place isn&#39;t packed because the sushi is beyond delicious. I remember when I was younger that this place was much busier than it is now, but the quality of food has not diminished one bit. 

I typically come on a Saturday (or Tuesday) when they have 1.25 sushi/sashimi special. Japanese restaurants should learn from Yamado- sashimi pieces should NOT be the size of a finger tip! The slices of fish are the perfect size and always bigger than what you get at any other restaurant. The spider roll is also my go-to roll, who can say no to soft shell crab? I&#39;ve tried nearly every roll on their menu, but I always come back to the dragon roll and spider roll. The tempura ice cream dessert is also delicious when you want a treat :) 

They have also introduced a happy hour menu when the rolls are 40% off. If this is your first time going to Yamado, try going then to get a bunch of rolls, and decide for yourself if you love the place as much as me!"

They don&#39;t get very busy, at least not on the weekdays during lunch time, and service is pretty quick.

I had miso soup, a spicy tuna roll, and a rainbow roll.  I didn&#39;t really like the miso, but the sushi rolls were good and much better than the other place across the street.  Yamado is nothing fancy, although the menu has a variety of food other than sushi.  The sushi menu has classic favorites like California rolls, but there are also a number of specialty rolls like a Chicago roll which is, of course, deep fried with cream cheese.

&#34;Yes, I&#39;d like a water and a..&#34; (Ring Ring)

&#34;Oh, excuse me.&#34; (Waitress walks away to answer her cell phone while I&#39;m speaking mid-sentence.)

What the what?!!!

She returned and throughout the rest of the experience she was very, very attentive. Very sweet lady. A tip for waitstaff though &#34;Don&#39;t EVER answer your cell phone while you&#39;re with a customer!&#34;. 

We ordered the Spicy Dragon Roll and 
Shrimp Tempura Roll. Easily the best maki rolls I&#39;ve had in Naper. Sushi was tight, fresh ingredients and sauces were very good. My son and I were veeeery happy. I was quickly forgetting the interrupting phone call. 

We also had the Bulgogi Ramen and the Curry Ramen. Bulgogi was spicy but okay. The Curry was weak. Wouldn&#39;t order either again because neither were great. They lacked flavor depth. I should have known better; this is a sushi house, not a ramen house. 

Also had gyoza. Worst I&#39;ve ever been served. They *should* be golden on one side and steamed on the other sides. These were strangely white, wrong thickness, dry, and looked freezer burnt. Suddenly, I&#39;m remembering that phone call again....

Not 10 min after the finish of my meal, I was curled up in my chair at home with stomach pains and loud rumblings. Uh-oh!! The only thing that I ate that no one else did was a half of that freezer burnt gyoza. 

I might try them one more time, simply because I loved their maki and it&#39;s a tall order to find good sushi in Naper; however, 1) I will not order an entree again. --Just sushi. 2) If I ever need to pop antacids after a meal, I&#39;ll never be back. 3) If the staff ever takes a call while they&#39;re serving me, or any other glaring faux pas, I will not be back. 

If I do return, perhaps I should phone my order in? ;)"

We caught the end of the Friday rush around 7pm as the parking lot opened up and walked into very friendly service.  Ordering was pretty simple and service was quick.

We started with fried scallops that were more like a seared-then-sliced scallop.  While not exactly what we were expecting the sauce was pretty good and scallops were A-OK, but nothing to write home about.  We also had a Shoyu ramen that went down just great but didn&#39;t have much flavor at all.  To be fair I&#39;d have probably ordered bulgogi ramen if it were up to me.  We rounded things out with a Cubs roll and a Grand Canyon roll which were both tasty in their own way, but looked like they&#39;d have much more flavor than they did.

I&#39;m totally not opposed to Yamado and its honestly one of the better sushi places in the area, but nothing really stood out to me from a standpoint of flavors or selection.  They have some creative roll names and its nice to offer some ramen/noodles as well, but nothing lit me up.  I&#39;d be glad to go back, but it&#39;ll probably be on someone else&#39;s motivational dime."

I noticed they had a sign for new shoyu ramen, which is what brought me in here for a quick lunch earlier today.

Arrived about 11:45, it was completely empty. The quiet, calm atmosphere was right up my alley as I&#39;m a weirdo and decided to read during my lunch. I don&#39;t really agree with the dated comments on the decor of the interior. No, it isn&#39;t stainless steel and glass with aluminum finish on the edges of the tables (or whatever the hell is &#39;in&#39; right now), but it&#39;s comfortable, inviting, and warm with the familiar feel of a sushi place. 

The sushi chef behind the counter greeted me as I was being seated, and the waitress was attentive and kind. I have to give her props for trying to check on me and not interrupt my reading at the same time (probably won&#39;t read at a restaurant again..)! The place may have been void of customers, but it&#39;s still worth to note her service was prompt and consistent.

I bought the shoyu ramen lunch special with spicy tuna rolls on the side. $9.95 for the ramen, $3.00 extra for the rolls. It comes with a house salad, which wasn&#39;t the best I&#39;ve had. The ginger dressing I felt could have used a bit more ginger, and it was mainly just iceberg lettuce leaves with a scant amount of carrot strips. And, I will have to echo as many stated below me - the ramen is bland. Very bland. 

I&#39;ve had ramen from Misoya, Mitsuwa and many kinds in cups but this had to be the least flavorful; only the times when I happened to grab a bit of pork or onion with my bite did I taste anything other than warm noodle. I&#39;m a beast for carbs, so I can&#39;t say I hated it, but I recommend veering away from their noodle dishes with &#39;ramen&#39; in the title. 

However, the saving grace. The spicy tuna was *pretty* good. It would be on the top of spicy tuna rolls I&#39;ve had, but that title firmly belongs to Zoku Sushi &amp; Thai in the city. It wasn&#39;t a hot mushy mess of bad fish like Sushi City in Downers Grove (I&#39;ve repressed those memories), but just enough of the sauce cut through piece of good tuna, with some cucumber sticks to round it out. Due to proximity of my house, I might get two orders of these to go for lunch once every week (it&#39;s on the two rolls for 9.95 deal!).

This is why I&#39;m giving Yamado a four star review. I have faith in the other reviews about how bomb the rolls are; I&#39;m not going to detract from the actual quality of the place since I just happened to order the weakest option on the menu. Will be going back and getting sushi, and I will report back with my findings!"

My daughter loves Ramen and we have gone to several Ramen Restaurants in Chicago. We have tried Ramen restaurants in other states whenever we travel too. We went to Yamado yesterday for the first time. We tried 4 different Premium Ramen. I would not call myself a Ramen expert, so my opinion is based only on comparison. We know Ramen is all about the broth. Yamado serves an okay  broth, it&#39;s thick enough but not as tasty as the one from some other places, The tastiest part comes from the pork belly which is well-marinated. The egg is just plain boiled egg. They could put some effort with the seaweed. (We got a tempura seaweed in every Ramen served by a restaurant in Denver with a cheaper price). We will not be back."

We pulled into the parking lot and... totally thought we were in the wrong place. It&#39;s basically in a strip mall with a smoke shop and a pawn shop. BUT - we gave it a shot anyway and...

Omg. The sushi here is just SO. DAMN. GOOD. They have a really extensive sushi menu, some very inventive rolls (check out the handwritten signage on the walls for the specials - love that) and a full menu with ramen, chicken/pork dishes, etc. Our 6YO goes for the chicken katsu every time. (And then my husband and I eat off her plate, because it&#39;s a huge portion and damn good.) The miso soup here is also noteworthy - just salty and savory enough... we&#39;ve actually gotten extra to go!

The tempura ice cream dessert is really large, so when someone asks if you want to split it and you&#39;re all like, &#34;Hell no, I want my own&#34; (um, oink, I&#39;ve done this) just trust me... split the thing. 

The staff are super friendly. Every single one. Even the sushi chef. The people just make the experience even more awesome. 

The happy hour specials are a little confusing (40 percent off a certain selection of sushi, but only if you pay for those in cash) BUT - those specials are good from 5-7 PM every day of the week! 

All in all... this place is LEGIT. We&#39;ve been several times since and will continue to be regulars. Don&#39;t let the strip mall location and random retail neighbors scare you off! This place is a gem. 

(Oh, and they have those awesome little after-dinner mints. Love that.)"

The husband and I decide to go out for sushi on a Friday night, and when we walked in at 7:30, there was only 1 table of people there.  So it seems that no reservations are needed at all.

We ordered:

Yellowstone Roll - this was a spicy salmon roll with eel, shrimp tempura, and all kinds of crunchies all over it.  Tasty, but small and falling apart easily as we were eating it.  I wouldn&#39;t order it again.

Octopus and cucumber roll - nice, clean flavor

Tuna and avocado roll - same as the octopus and cucumber roll where the flavors were nice and the rolls didn&#39;t fall apart, nor did they cheat with extra rice.  Just enough, and the flavor/texture was good.  

Overall when it comes to the rolls, I would rather order more of the simpler regular ones as opposed to the special/signature rolls, which are more than double the price for barely more sushi.

Nigiri - egg, eel, salmon, white tuna, mackerel, sweet shrimp
For the most part, all of them were decent, nothing mind blowing.  The salmon was cut a bit on the thinner side, and slightly fishy as well.  The white tuna didn&#39;t have the texture that I&#39;m used to - melt in your mouth, easy to chew - instead it was harder to chew, almost like squid.  

Even though I&#39;m leaning towards 3 stars, I would return and focus on those simple rolls and some of the other nigiri that I previously mentioned.  The prices are great, especially if you go during their happy hour...but then again, whenever there&#39;s happy hour in sushi, doesn&#39;t that mean the fish isn&#39;t as fresh?"

This place pretty much set the standard for me. For example, their miso soup is free so I am outraged whenever I have to pay for miso soup at other sushi places... grrr. I always order salmon rolls and IMO, this place has the best salmon rolls. The quality sucked for a little bit (I believe there was a change in management) but it&#39;s back to the good ol&#39; days again. 

I would stay away from their half off specialty rolls (I think it&#39;s their happy hour special) because most of them are deep fried and greasy. It seems like a good deal but you are going to regret it, I swear!  Besides their sushi, they also have awesome udon. Though some of my friends have said that it&#39;s overwhelming (ie soooo much ingredients.. which I feel like what udon should be.. but whatever). 

Disclaimer: I&#39;m probably rating this a 5/5 for nostalgic/sentimental reasons."

I came here with my grown up boo and another couple for Saturday night double date time!!!! Not only am I excited for an excuse to wear butt huggin&#39; jeans and eyeliner out for the love of my life, I am excited for ramen and sushi! So here&#39;s my breakdown:

The good:
- Loose values on typical &#34;Happy Hour&#34; rules. I didn&#39;t think happy hour applied to weekends, but it does here! From 5-7 they have a select list of sushi rolls that are 40% off. Every day, not just M-F. Score!!!
- The service. Incredibly nice and helpful. I can&#39;t rave about this enough.
- The sushi! It was pretty solid. Every roll we purchased was off the happy hour menus (because we cheap!) and I liked them all. The fried ones were heavier but melt-in-your-mouth good, the unfried ones were damn fine. 

The mediocre:
- The ramen. We ordered the miso ramen. It was just okay. This might be because I am a major ramen snob lately and make the most kick ass ramen at home. Ask me for my soup recipe, I dare you!

The endearing:
- The home made signs on the walls for drink specials made with poster boards. Oh how I love mom and pop restaurants!
- The free &#34;chef&#39;s compliments&#34; app we got at the end of our meal. It was great because it included tuna, jalapeños, and a fried outer shell. How nice, I think I love you guys."

The waitress we had was not familiar with the menu, the cashier at the front is not qualified to run a cash register and worse of all, they kept putting the carry out orders in front of the dine in tickets. We sat there for 40 mins and there was somehow still 3 tickets in front of us. I realize there is only one sushi chef but 40 mins, you can at least make one roll for us to keep us busy but no not even started our ticket.

Every staff member (except chef) just looks really confused as to what they are suppose to be doing...our experience was a complete dinner fail."

Their sushi is fresh and delicious. My favorite food items here are the philadelphia rolls, yakisoba, and their PERFECT miso soup. Best miso soup that I&#39;ve had, and I have frequented many Japanese restaurants. 

I recently tried the fried scallop appetizer, and it was absolutely amazing. Scallops are on the top of my seafood faves, and most places don&#39;t cook them to my liking. These scallops were pretty much near perfection! I will be ordering these again -- so juicy, so yummy!!

The sushi chef was so nice and threw in an extra treat for my friend and I, and it was the sweetest thing. Their sushi chef is a master! All the staff is attentive and well mannered. Please come in and try this place! You will not be dissappointed."

I like that everything tastes so fresh there.

Even though their location might not be the fanciest and their interior could use an update, but they definitely make for that by delivering tasty and high quality sushi.

Their staff is also very friendly and welcoming.

Went a few days ago, and none of the specials listed on their web site were in effect. No big deal, I guess, but the &#34;$1.25 every day nigiri&#34; was definitely the reason we went.

Outside of their deals, this place is now edging near the &#34;too expensive for the quality&#34; line. We both ordered entrees, and a bunch of rolls. Despite asking for the rolls first, the order things came was closer to the first entree arriving awkwardly early, rolls came a good 10 minutes later, then my entree came not long after that. Really strange.

Still, I haven&#39;t found a sushi place I like better in the area, which kind of says a lot about the Naperville/Lisle sushi scene more than it does this specific restaurant."

I usually eat at off times so again I was the only customer in the place. My service was quiet and friendly and the interior of this business is quite a bit cuter than the budget strip-mall window-front next to a pawn shop and a Subway would lead you to believe. It&#39;s still not a great date environment, or anything flashy, but it&#39;s totally fine if you&#39;ve got the crave for soosh. 

Their menu is huge and based almost entirely on the topic at hand, which seems obvious but if you&#39;re dining with someone who isn&#39;t all about raw fish, they&#39;ll a lot fewer options here than at other Japanese restaurants. Not a bad thing, just saying it for the record. 

I started with a miso soup and though it was a larger sized bowl than I&#39;d been getting at other places, it was just fine. I was excited to cut into my plate of fishies, consisting of one tuna and one salmon nigiri, a 911 roll and a spicy tuna, but as soon as the plate was placed in front of me, I noticed something that wasn&#39;t present at the other places I&#39;d visited that week: The fishy smell. The scent appeared as soon as the selections were placed in front of me and immediately put a damper on anything I was about to eat. It wasn&#39;t overwhelming, but it was there and it made a first impression on me that started things off on the wrong foot. After that, I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect taste-wise, but was hoping for something to the contrary of the smell... and that&#39;s exactly what I got. Somehow, it managed to be lacking almost any flavor at all, less the taste of what I&#39;d consider over-saturated rice. It wasn&#39;t terrible by any means, but it wasn&#39;t my favorite. 

It looked like they did offer some pretty great daily specials, and I&#39;d half wished I&#39;d taken advantage of those but I sat facing the sushi bar and the specials were posted around the corner, out of my frame of sight. One thing I did notice but didn&#39;t take advantage of were there $5 drink all-day-everyday drink specials, which looked like a pretty good deal. 

I don&#39;t know that I&#39;m rushing to go back, but I wouldn&#39;t be opposed to second try on a different day with fresher fish, perhaps during a busier hour so I could get the full and true Yamado experience that other reviewers referenced."

We ordered the Orange Dragon and King Kong rolls and the Nabeyaki Udon.  The shrimp tempera in the OD roll was frozen!  I guess they must have fried a batch the night or week BEFORE then froze them and just reheated it.  I was sooo turned off that it killed my appetite.  I can&#39;t believe paying $12-14 for a roll with FROZEN seafood.  That is just wrong.  I can&#39;t believe they can&#39;t take the time to make a quality product.  The KK roll was doused with sriracha mayo and sweet sauce that just overwhelm all the other favors.  The udon came 30 minutes later in a piping hot cauldron.  There were lots of noodles and broth but not much of anything else.  The egg was overcooked and the broth was bland.  It was definitely not worth the $50.  The server schooled us that you have to pay cash to get the 40% discount and show her that we had the cash in hand.  It was NOT the type of hospitality that you&#39;d expect in a tiny place like this.  We will never be back again.

We also had a warm Grand Canyon roll (spicy tuna) topped with &#34;crunch&#34; or fried bread shavings.

Yamado has the largest pieces of sushi I&#39;ve ever come across. The nigiri is easily three times the size of any other Chicagoland sushi.

Plus this place was banging Kanye and Mos Def so I was definitely feeling the vibe. I went in for lunch with my parents and a brother and the other patrons were all around my age (mid-to-late twenties) plus some younger families. I can&#39;t make an observation on the normal clientele but the fact that young children can have a good time at a place where mid-twenty-year-old couples don&#39;t feel lame is usually a good sign of diversity.

I ordered the chicken bento box. The pieces of chicken were huge and actually filled its section of the box. In addition, I tried the california roll and their hawaiian mango roll, which is shrimp tempura with mango, both were delicious.  If you&#39;re in the mood, grab the hawaiian mango roll.

The only &#34;bad&#34; thing I can say was that my miso soup was a bit on the bland side but I&#39;m really knit-picking.

My brother got a 18 piece sushi plate and they hooked him up. Again, I cannot emphasize how large the pieces of nigiri were. I felt like Kirstie Alley walking out of there.

Our server was very accommodating, even after my dad made some horrible Michael Scott-esque jokes about rice and samurai. Our food also came surprisingly fast. 

It was a great experience and I&#39;m going to make this my new habitual sushi stop."

I heard they are under new management, which explains the change in regular staff and marketing tactics (that huge banner that&#39;s always on a van in the parking lot?? that&#39;s new...).  It looks like they are still Korean owned as they still offer Korean dishes mixed in with their Japanese.

I&#39;m pleased to say the change doesn&#39;t seem to have affected quality.  Granted, I&#39;ve eaten more rolls recently than my beloved nigiri, but they have been very good.  Recommendations I can make are the T-Roll, Yellowstone Roll, and Geisha Roll, they were all very tasty :3  Their nigiri portions (from what I&#39;ve seen so far) are still fairly generous, and the $1.25 special seems to be a lot more frequent (is it really all the time??) than the previous Tuesday dinner/Saturday lunch, so you can enjoy that!  After a brief glance at the regular menu, the bugolgi ramen caught my eye so I might try that next time.  I&#39;ve eaten the bibimbap here and it was standard, meaning delicious.

If you&#39;ve eaten here before, you can still expect quality, just different faces.  Probably the best priced sushi around with the special!"

I have been to many more pricey sushi places in Naperville, and I even went to a few on the 2007 Chicago Tribune &#34;Best Sushi in Chicago&#34; list.  None of them were better than Yamado, and Yamado was always half the price!  

Mr. Lee sold Yamado last September, and since then the new owner Mrs. Lee (no relationship) has made a few changes.  There is now a list of Chef&#39;s Specials on the menu, about half of which are new rolls.  These are HALF OFF if you pay with cash from 4:30-6 every day of the week, and all night on Friday.  The T-Roll is always my favorite (about $6.50 for 10pc. with the cash deal), and the Chicago and Mild rolls are are always at the top of my list too.  There are also new appetizers, salads, and entrees from the kitchen.  Finally, they offer $1.25 sushi all day every day now.

Mrs. Lee and the staff are all very nice and accommodating.  And although some popular rolls have been taken off the menu (like the Las Vegas and Volcano), the sushi chef is still happy to make them if you just ask the server.  They will also fulfill any request that you might throw at them, like substituting ingredients, cutting rolls differently, ect.."

For whatever reason my family has always hated it and I grew up thinking the place sucked. Then one fateful day I received coupons in the mail for the restaurant. I knew that there was one relatively close to where I lived, so I thought, &#34;why not check the coupons out to see what they have?&#34; Best decision ever.

The coupons showed me how incredibly cheap Steak &#39;n&#39; Shake is. I never knew it before. I&#39;m used to Chicago prices for a burger, or these gourmet burger places popping up since burgers are chic now. This place though, $4 for a  burger and fries. That&#39;s crazy cheap! Not only that but they have so many types of burgers to try. Cajun, philly cheese steak, garlic, etc. Then when you add in the different milkshakes they have, you open up a giant pool of food choices to get.

When I went I used a coupon that beats all others. The coupon got me 1 double steak burger, 1 milk shake, a fry, and 1 side of my choice (I got onion rings) all for $6. I don&#39;t know a single restaurant that would give you all of that for so cheap. However I reserved my opinion for the taste. I bit into the burger and was pleasantly surprised. The burger itself wasn&#39;t amazing or anything, but it was good. It had a lot of toppings (mayo and ketchup which I love) on it and the burger wasn&#39;t burnt which a lot of reviews stated happened to theirs. I genuinely enjoyed the very inexpensive burger. 

The fries were super disappointing. They are shoestring fries which I have never liked. They aren&#39;t meaty and their flavor is generic/lacking. Luckily Stake &#39;n&#39; Shake gives you some French fry seasoning to put on them which definitely upgrades the flavor. They are still terribly unsatisfying. The onion rings were tasty. They were very thick, and the batter they used was pretty good. The milkshake was the hardest thing for me to pick. They have so many tasty sounding options, but I had to go with my tried and true peanut butter cup. The milkshake was decent. I didn&#39;t prefer it over say getting ice cream at Culver&#39;s, but it was definitely good. There wasn&#39;t a ton of the peanut butter cups mixed inside which I was sad about, but there was enough to get the flavor.

Overall I don&#39;t see why people do not like Steak &#39;n&#39; Shake. The food is insanely affordable (especially with the coupons) and there&#39;s tons of variety. Yeah, it might not be the best tasting food, but sometimes cost/quantity outweighs being the best. I will definitely be going back to try more of the burgers and milkshakes."

The cherry limeade is refreshing and the patty melt is delicious. It was a little bit too greasy for my taste, however, it was worth the extra calories. The burger was so soggy and greasy that I threw it away after just two bites and the fries were flavorless. The milkshakes are ok, but for that price, I expected it to be better. For the milkshakes, I would highly recommend  the Mint or the Oreo shakes. 

The staffs were friendly and the service was quick. This place reminded me of Johnny Rockets. The prices of the meals are so cheap compared to other burger places. 4 bucks for a burger and fries, what more can you ask for? However, the quality of the food can be better. Parking lot is spacious so finding a parking is not a problem. The best thing about this place is that it is open 24/7"

I sure didn&#39;t. It&#39;s apparently a holiday thing, and once the holidays are over, I&#39;m going to be one sad ginger ninja. That is if I can still fit in my car to drive over and get one. Maybe I should walk instead. Maybe it&#39;s far enough to burn off at least a few of those cookie butter shake calories.

Um. Where was I? Oh yeah. Steak &#39;n Shake. This location is not without its problems. The drive-thru always seems to be backed up. And the food is hit or miss, honestly. Most of the time it&#39;s decent, but last time I came my frisco melt was burnt and didn&#39;t have nearly enough sauce, so it was basically a dry burnt sandwich.

But on the upside, my puggles have no complaints. I bring them with for a shooter of their own, and they at least leave with a smile on their face.

Note: This happened about 6 years ago - just want to say that I have been Steak n Shake free!!"

The day we went there was a sign on the door &#34;help wanted&#34;. I should have known better than to go in. Most of the tables were occupied and most did not have food in front of them. Not a good sign.
The wait time was not as bad as I anticipated but it still took us an hour &amp; half  to get out of there. We could see the staff was hustling and everyone was very pleasant especially considering their obvious short handedness. 
I hope management appreciates the staff they have working for them because they are heroes in what could have been a bad experience. 

For a burger and fries, you can&#39;t beat $4.99. 
Obviously their &#34;money maker&#34; is their shakes that are good, but spendy. However they do have a happy hour for their shakes, from 2-5 pm, and that helps the cost. 
However, management really needs to work on hiring more staff. The &#34;hole&#34; shows."

The bacon horseradish single w/fries was good, and for $4, how can you go wrong?  Still though, not the best thing on their $4 menu.  Their ultimate banana milkshake is SO GOOD it&#39;s sinful.  The difference between the &#39;ultimate&#39; and the regular is that the latter uses flavored powder while the former uses real fruit.  It&#39;s worth the slight upcharge.

I stopped to pick up a milk shake for someone I was going to visit at the rehab center.  There is one drive up window.  The person working that window takes your order, takes your money when you get up to the window, makes change, and then prepares your meal.  Now, I don&#39;t work for the Board of Health, but can he do that?  Fortunately, my order consisted of only  a milk shake, but I have NEVER waited 20 minutes in a drive up line of 4 cars.

First of all, I have always loved Steak &#39;n Shake ever since I have tried their burgers and shakes back in St. Louis. With high hopes, I found a Steak &#39;n Shake close to our apartment and decided to venture out hoping that my expectations will be met or better yet, exceeded. 

The first few visits went ok. Food was good, shakes better. The service was alright and I did not notice any stray hairs nor felt anything that resembles the sliminess and stickiness of spit so I was happy.

The most recent visit was not that good of an experience at all. It was a late night trip with my girlfriend to satisfy our late night hunger (mostly my hunger.) Anyway, I distinctly remember ordering a chili, a burger, a large order of fries, and lemonade. When my chili arrived, the noodles were cold -- fresh from the refrigerator. The sauce was barely even warm. Guess they didn&#39;t warm it enough in the microwave. I should have just sent it back. However, the thought of having unwanted spit or boogers in my food terrified me so I maned up and ate my chili. Burgers came out good as always, fries were alright. 

The night would have been better and maybe I could have enjoyed my cold chili if only we had a different waitress. Our waitress was less than a saint. She gave us the vibe that she did not want to be there at all and she made sure that we, the customers, felt it. She was very unpleasant not just to us, but to the other tables she waited for as well. My girlfriend usually does not complain when it comes to bad service (because I speak up enough for the both of us) but this was a different situation. She was the one who was unsatisfied with her service which is a record since she is the one who tells me to shake a bad service off. If it was bad for her, then the service was indeed horrible. 

I also noticed that a lot of tables haven&#39;t been cleaned and was sitting there waiting for christmas. They took their time to clean them which was really disgusting and unappetizing. This happened not only once, but to every visit in this Steak &#39;n Shake.

So as I close this review, I can proudly say that we will never come back to this Steak &#39;n Shake and if you are smart, you will avoid this location too."

Place was in a state of slight chaos, apparently there was this 2:30 pm hunger crunch so there were a lot of people here.  We waited for about five minutes before being seated and another 10 before getting a menu.

I ordered a double steakburger with fries and a side of chili.  My date ordered some jalapeno burger (not really sure if that&#39;s what they call it).  She ordered the jalapeno burger because of the avacado and forgot to tell them to hold the jack cheese, which she doesn&#39;t like.  So when she gave me the sad eye treatment, we ended up swapping burgers.

To be honest, the guacamole made the burger messy to eat and the flavor overwhelmed the taste of the sandwich, which was a bit tasteless to begin with.  Upside of the meal were the shoestring fries which were pretty good.  Chili was subpar, the beans were cooked with the chili giving it a beany creamy texture.  I like the old downstate style where the chili is dumped on top of the beans.  My companion also ordered cheese to go with her fries and onion rings.  Cheese was standard cheese whiz and onion rings were OK but really greasy.

Overall, the place could have rated a three star, but slow service and being grimy without charm knocked them down a notch."

I ordered the double cheeseburger and a smores shake. It was AMAZING! (Second star) 
The third star I would give to the overall experience I had while dining. It was good not great. 
The reason for not giving them a higher score is because of the smell of B.O when you first walk in and the time it took for us to be waited on once seated. Our server, Brandon, did not give us his undivided attention. I felt it was because he was the only waiter assisting the customers. Another negative was i received my milk shake in bad condition.

The first thing to comment on is the service here. It took me around 10 minutes after sitting down for someone to actually come and ask if they were ready to take my order. Now if it were busy I would have been fine with the wait, but they weren&#39;t particularly busy at all with at most 1/4 of the tables and booths in use.

Once I was finally able to  I ordered the Chicago style hot dog, being a big chain I didn&#39;t come in with high expectations for this hot dog. As I pulled open the menu I thought to myself &#34;How can this possibly be worse than the Sonic Drive-In Chicago style hot dog&#34;. Well, I was about to find out. For starters it doesn&#39;t look like a Chicago style hot dog. It has a non poppy seed bun, the hot dog is cut straight up the middle so all the juices and flavor soak out, the type of pickle used is a far cry from the pickle spears or slices used, the bun itself seems grilled so it&#39;s hard, and there&#39;s no attempt at even distribution of condiments. The question is, how did it taste? Well quite frankly it tasted even worse than it looked. The peppers included were way too hot, the hot dog sausage itself had an odd flavor, the relish used while the right color was too sweet, the pickles just added to the sweetness. This hot dog is flat out awful.

I wouldn&#39;t say this is the absolute worst Chicago style hot dog I&#39;ve found. But it&#39;s right towards the top. Avoid the Chicago style hot dog here, it&#39;s not even worth looking at the menu picture as it will ruin your appetite."

a pattern. I ordered two Chilimacs and when I got home found one order to behalf full and the second order barely one fourth of the first order. I guess I will have to forgo this meal as the $8.00 charge is less food than at any other fast food restaurant. Too bad as this was one place I rely enjoyed."

But when you&#39;re hungry late at night, it satisfies your cravings. The service is terrible at this location, especially at night. You are seated and it takes a good 10 minutes for someone to come by and take your order. Or you will order a salad or soup before your meal, and the waitress/waiter either forgets it and charges it on your bill, or takes forever to bring it and then you&#39;re barely finished eating it by the time your food comes. 

Also, once your waiter/waitress brings your food, they leave the bill on your table and completely disappear. Then they sit by the kitchen talking with their coworkers when you want their attention because you want to order something else, or want a refill on your drink. 

If you go here, don&#39;t expect to be in and out fast. The waiters and waitresses stand around and talk for most of the time. Then it takes forever to get their attention again once they take off and they&#39;ve already brought you your food. The service is terrible all the time, busy or not. The waiters and waitresses just stand around and act like they have nothing to do. 

I only come here because its open late, but the service is terrible!"

The guy was really busy and it seems he was working hard but none if the other workers seem to care about us. I would&#39;ve gave this place a one if it wander for the worker that is trying his best to serve almost everyone in the resturaunt and the cooks the other workers just sit there at stare at you like your an alien. The decorations here are nice but it seems like stuff is beginning to fall apart also it is very hot in here. We accidentally hit a sign and it almost fell apart which is kind of shows me that they don&#39;t seem to care about their decoration.

Steak &#39;n Shake is super casual, and grabbing something really greasy and a shake at 3 a.m. doesn&#39;t really get any better. Check out the Frisco Melt or a steakburger, and you have to have a shake. My current favorite shake is the strawberry frozen yogurt, and I put hot fudge in it. (So much for healthy...)

Time of my visit: late dinner pick up

I should start by saying, this is not a first time I have been to that place before and probably won&#39;t be last.  This time it was a pick up order just like last few times.  I ordered potstickers and orange chicken (I think they call it Thai Orange Chicken). I must say I am not a Thai loving person, actually until my current girlfriend, I would not give it another thought, however, all Thai places she has ever dragged me to, this is by far the best.  Both potstickers and orange chicks tasted delicious!  Hot and fresh!  The cook knows what she is doing!

However, there is a reason why I have been doing pick ups vs dine-in...  The place is ran by husband and wife duo and the husband is not the best server around.  I get that it&#39;s hard to separate emotions from your business and those emotions can negatively reflect on the service.  Higher a good waitress!  When comes to prices, it is Glen Ellyn and that area GE/Wheaton/Naperville is overpriced, so be ready for that.

The 5 star rating and my A is solely based on food!  Would definitely recommend trying it."

For months I was a regular there (it&#39;s convenient since I&#39;m a bachelor living in a nearby apartment building). I would habitually stop at a nearby liquor store and buy a bottle of Grosch beer, then brown bag at M&amp;W.  This was before they had a liquor license. In all the months I did this, not once did Harry clear the brown bag from the table. Did he think I wanted to keep it? It was a little detail, but it irked me. He never clears anything from the table. He&#39;s notorious for not refilling water and jumbling orders and being, I&#39;ll say it, a little stingy.  

Then there&#39;s the size of the portions. Some dishes raise eyebrows they are so small. After many many weeks of eating their fare, I settled on fried rice as their best and hardiest dish. But last time I went for that, it was off. Everything else is good but on the average side. 

I have to say on their behalf that they did very well in catering two parties of mine, but I haven&#39;t been there in months now."

I will call the health department too.  I had thought he was just busy and didn&#39;t think of it,  now I know its that he didn&#39;t care.

The restaurant itself does not have a Thai-vibe, but is more Americanized, which I actually like as a change of pace. I got my food to-go though and it was super fast and convenient because I called ahead. (I also appreciated a fully English-speaking host because he got my order right, verified everything, showed me the check before ringing it up, etc. All things that make me feel important as a customer, so that I love.) 

The potstickers are AMAZING!! I mean, made me all kinds of crazy happy. But I was bummed about the Pad Thai, hoped for so much better. It wasn&#39;t as flavorful as it could be (maybe a bit more sauce?), could use something more like maybe carrot shavings, the little bit of chopped cabbage was limp and sad by the time I got back, my chicken was super dry and chewy, and I got half chicken/half Tofu which I didn&#39;t want and I hate Tofu. 

All that to say, I will keep trying this place to see if I can love it, because you never know. Maybe it was an off day or maybe I need to have it fresh in the restaurant next time. Recommend trying it at least!

I gave this place four stars because of the food. I worked at a Thai restaurant and I would constantly get pad Thai. At M &amp; W I get everything. I have not tried a bad dish.

So where to start? This restaurant has a bit of an identity crisis. Is it a sit down place to get waited on, a quick take out place to order or is it a happy hour place to grab drinks and eat some spring rolls? We may never know

I came here back in early September and was immediately confused upon walking in. To the left, a full bar with a TV. To the right, a few tables for eating. In the back corner, there is a carryout or ordering counter with no menu to order from. There is no posted sign that says sit yourself or order here. So being my first time here you have to understand how confusing this is bc you have no idea what to do with yourself. 

After placing my order from a pamphlet, I waited a good 15-20 minutes at the bar and chatted with the owner. Seemed like a nice guy but I could tell this might be his first go at the restaurant industry. I&#39;ve worked in the industry half my life and could smell the oblivious newcomer on him. 

We went with the basics: pad thai, crab wontons, basil fried rice. Food was ok but nothing spectacular or memorable. I&#39;m hoping that this review will provide some constructive criticism because I would never want to see a business fail.  

Pros:
Easy to find location, crab wonton sauce was awesome. It was a pineapple sweet and sour which was the best part of the meal. 

Cons:
First, there need to be a visible menu and sense of direction upon entering (host, sign menu, anything!). Next, scrap the bar idea bc most people are not going to drink at a thai place in a mini mall unless you have the ambience that people want to hang out at. This is definitely not a trendy night spot to be at. Next, the service needs to be faster and food needs more seasoning and flavor. The pad thai was bland and not enough chicken or vegetables and same for the fried rice. Last, prices are too high for the area. 

Will try again in the future so maybe they have a chance for redemption. Please prove me wrong next time"

When he came into the restaurant, the person who helped him kept talking about how busy they were, but there was no one else in the restaurant. The tables were dirty, as if people had been there, and no one had cleaned up or bussed anything. It took much longer than we were told to get our food. We tried really hard to give it a fair shot, but we ended up throwing away most of our food and getting something else on the way home.  I really wanted to like this place, because it was the closest Thai to my work, but unfortunately it just wasn&#39;t the quality I was looking for."

Came in near closing time and they were happy to accommodate. The Minced Chicken Curry Noodle dish was great and my girlfriend really liked her dish as well. I was sad when the Crab Rangoons were gone. 

The place could use a little more ambience...add some low light and nice music. Turn off the TV. But I will order take-out again. Excited to have good Thai nearby."

We ordered tofu pad Thai, spicy and sweet and sour chicken.  Not only was the pad Thai not spicy, it literally had no taste. The tofu was cooked well, but since the dish had no taste it too was bland. The sweet and sour chicken wasn&#39;t bad, but since the chicken is breaded the saltiness took over a bit, although it was welcomed since the other dish was so bland. We, unfortunately will not return."

Old review:
We liked it. The pot stickers are not like typical pot stickers that are &#34;doughy&#34;, these are light and almost crunchy, and were delicious, as was the dipping sauce.  And the pad thai was just a little on the bland side, but after adding some  peanut sauce ($2.00), it was great!  Kind of a pricey lunch at $35 with tax and tip, but we&#39;re glad there&#39;s a good Thai place just blocks away, and we no longer need to drive quite a distance away. The owners are friendly, and the portions are not small. We were satisfied, and we&#39;re not small people. If you want a buffet, go to a buffet. (08/09/14)"

However, I have never been treated so poorly at any restaurant. I ordered a dish with broccoli and requested extra broccoli. It came with six tiny florets. I asked for more broccoli and was told I would have to pay more. I chose not to, as the dish was already at the table. However, I mentioned to the waiter and restaurant owner that usually at other restaurants this type of dish comes with more broccoli. I was promptly told that I should go to the other restaurant and eat their food. I was puzzled to get the bill with added broccoli on it (without charge). So I asked why there was no extra broccoli added given that it was on the receipt. I was reminded that I was given a chance to add extra broccoli with charge and refused it. In addition, I was subject to a tirade. I was told I was a jerk and that I should be ashamed of myself. None of my attempts to apologize or to acknowledge that the food tasted good seem to calm him down. It is too bad as the restaurant is in a good location and the food is good. However I was told I would never be welcome again.  I honestly had a moment when I feared he would run out of the restaurant and continue yelling at me while I went to my car. Incidentally, no one else was in the restaurant. Perhaps they had already experienced the same thing!"

The food was EXCELLENT! Seriously, I could eat the lamb chops, sausages, and filet mignon all night. The salad bar was a superb addition, as well! I was particularly happy (and impressed!) to see the giant portion of fresh imported Italian mozzarella and the enormous slab of freshly-grated parmigiana reggiano. I know, you&#39;re probably wondering why I&#39;m talking about the salad bar at a Brazilian steakhouse, but that part (along with the copious amount of fresh veggies) reminded me of my time in Italy - that&#39;s how good it was! 

The only hiccup I would say we had was in the server. He was good, but our plates piled up on our table often and the gauchos seemed overly zealous eto serve us with food (when our card was turned to red). Other than that, I&#39;d say we had a nearly-flawless evening here...and I do not say that lightly! We will definitely be back...just not for a few months - still recovering from all the food, ha!"

I left with a full belly and a nice time with friends, but I would never eat here again. 

Despite the fact that our party of 12 had reservations made well in advance, we had to wait 30 minutes to be seated. Our large party had to stand around during prime time as the masses squeezed around us and through our group until we were finally seated with absolutely NO apology or &#34;thank you for your patience&#34;. We didn&#39;t let that damper the mood though - we sat at our table and were fully prepared to be impressed.

The servers were attentive, the salad bar was really good. Why the 2 stars, you ask? Very simple. For all of the meat selections they carry and advertise, we saw very few of them. The Picanha and the lamb were plentiful and in heavy rotation but everything else? Either MIA or we barely saw them. I had to repeatedly request the ribeye - and when I say &#34;repeatedly&#34;, I mean NO LESS THAN TEN DIFFERENT TIMES, often to the same gaucho, who clearly forgot my request from the last time I had asked him because he kept asking me which meat I was waiting for. The bacon-wrapped filet came around once in the 2 hours we were there. No sausage, no plain filet, no chicken legs, no ribs (pork OR beef). Out of the 12 cuts they boast, we were lucky to have seen maybe 6 in total. And while that is plenty to make a meal out of, considering the party size and money spent on this meal, there is no excuse for that kind of inattentiveness to detail. A patron should not have have to ask (and ask and ask) for what a restaurant claims to freely offer. 

Since it was my friend&#39;s birthday, I did not want to make a fuss. I paid my portion of the bill and left. I sincerely hope she chooses a better place next year."

I saw this place on the corner as I was looking for the Marriott Suites Hotel.  I&#39;m a fan of Brazilian steakhouses as there are a few in my general area.  Once I got to the hotel they confirmed that they provide shuttle service to this restaurant.  I checked Yelp and saw 4.5 stars average rating so that was a good start.  I took the Marriott shuttle over and it&#39;s a good thing I did!  Parking was a disaster and there was a valet attendant out front.

I go inside and am seated and greeted promptly.  I was shown the salad bar area and my server explained the process to me (no different than what I already knew).  I made a few selections form the salad bar but wanted to save room for plenty of meat.  In a short burst, I received Picanha, rib eye steak, filet mignon, pepper steak and beef rib.  I had seconds of Picanha and rib eye.  The meats tasted great and the service was good.

I saved some time with this process as I didn&#39;t have to wait for someone to take my food order and the food came out fast.  I really enjoyed the meal but not the check.  I knew it would be pricey but damn!  I believe it was over $65 myself for dinner, Diet Coke, tax and tip.  Four stars!"

They have smoked salmon, Gouda cheese, salami, artichoke hearts, asparagus, peppers, mozzarella balls, and several types of salads. All super fresh and delicious. 
The second phase is the meat phase, they offer 12 different meats cooked to perfection. Gauchos deliver meat to you and carve right at the table. They keep doing so until you signal them to stop.

I have been to similar establishments in the past and this place was only second place if not on par with the other places I&#39;ve been. The arrangement in the salad bar was a treat to try. But of course the main draw is the skewers of meat they bring to your table. I could not get enough of this. Everything was cooked perfectly at varying levels (rare, medium, well done, etc). 
The side dishes of mashed potatoes and roasted banana must be tried! And DO NOT PASS UP THEIR BISCUITS! This is an order.
My only gripes were that the staff had difficult to understand accents or they obviously didn&#39;t speak English well enough. It was hard to understand them at times.

This is a wonderful place for a date, Valentine&#39;s Day, impressing a client, or just celebrating something special. But be aware the cost to eat here can be pricy. For me I might only go twice a year at best. But I guarantee it&#39;s worth it!"

So much deliciousness to be found here, though admittedly not as much in the salad bar as some other area Brazilian steakhouses (such as Texas de Brazil, at least at the Ohio St location in Chicago).

We got a great lunch price here, and their plantains are absolutely amazing. I could drink their magical lime aid all day until I explode.

As far as service, it was rather mixed on our visit. We had a server who mumbled and only spoke to one adult at the table, and another who was very charming to all of us."

In the center of the restaurant is a salad bar with many delicious-looking options such as: salad fixings of many varieties. some examples include: asparagus, roasted peppers, marinated olives, bacon, and fresh parmesan cheese. Although I passed up on these, in favor of saving room for sampling as many of the different meats as possible, it looked fresh and delicious!

We sat down and within 2 minutes we had delicious buttered mini biscuits, fried polenta, mashed potatoes with chives/cheese/bacon, and fried bananas/plantains on the table and within a minute or so after that, the parade of meats began! 

For those who don&#39;t know, servers go around with skewers of meat looking for individuals who have their &#34;card/button&#34; flipped to &#34;green&#34; which is a sign for them to approach the table and offer what they&#39;ve got.

My favorites were: filet minion (without the bacon), ribeye, bottom sirloin, and prime rib. The top sirloin, bacon-wrapped filet minion, and lamb were all very good too, just not my favorite. Each piece of meat I had was cooked perfectly for me (medium-rare) but if you prefer another temperature for your meat, all you have to do is ask!  I did not eat the chicken, but I am going to assume that it is cooked equally well (to perfection) and is likely quite delicious.

Our server was extremely attentive, and even chased down the filet minion and ribeye guys for us! While I was waiting for the filet minion to come around, I was informed 3 times in 5 minutes that the filet minion was coming and would be right out to me as soon as it was done. 

Everything about the experience was top-notch and was well worth the price.

We were only able to enjoy the lamb since it was the only meat option which was halal, but they charged us the full price ( around 50 $ ) which I felt was unfair.

The salad bar was great but options were definitely lacking compared to Texas de Brazil, which I felt had much better salad bar offerings including grilled veggies, rice and beans and several types of sauces and soup - they only had one soup option here and no chimichanga sauce!!!!

The service was great but it was overwhelming at times. Would barely take a sip of water or Soda and the waiter or waitress would swoop in and fill it immediately. They just kept coming to the table and it felt kinda awkward and uncomfortable. 

Got the flan and Papya cream for dessert both delicious!

Can&#39;t speak to the other types of meat since we only had he lamb which was very good.

Overall a good dining experience but definitely pricy. I believe that Texas de Brazil definitely has better salad bar options and appeared aesthetically more pleasing."

It was worth the wait. The salad bar was good, although the only time I went up some items I wantedto try were being refilled therefore missing. Oh well, that gave me more room for the meat. Every server who stopped by our table was friendly and helpful. The drinks were just as good as the food. Even my dad who doesn&#39;t like beef found a lot of variety and the manager helped him get more of the food he particularly wanted. I&#39;d say the only downside was our server said there were 12 types of meat but I think only 8 made it around to our table, which was fine because I ate too much anyways.

The service was unparalleled. Not one of the servers who came by our table (and there were several!) gave the impression of &#34;being at work&#34;. I mean that in the sense of &#34;This is for my paycheck&#34;, or &#34;I just want to go home&#34;, or some sort of robotic routine. Absolutely every one of them came off as passionate about their work and genuinely seemed to want us to have the full experience. 

As for the food, I hit the salad bar before accepting the various meats they offered. The salad bar is huge and offers a great variety. I chose caesar salad, asparagus, broccoli, Shitake mushrooms, lime &amp; basil sauce, baby spinach, sun-dried tomatoes, marinated onions, and smoked salmon. The best things were the Shitake mushrooms, smoked salmon, and sun-dried tomatoes. 

I will say this: Go light on the salad bar if you want to eat a good amount of the meat. The meat is much more unique to the restaurant than the salad bar, however great the latter may be.

Of the meats they offered, I selected the lamb, garlic steak, and the sirloin steak. I would have had more, but I was stuffed by the end of it all. 

Going back ASAP."

Compared to Texas De Brazil and Fargo De Chao, Chama Gaucha has prime cuts of meat served during their lunch times, including filet mignon.  

They have a nice salad bar spread, including soup, fresh greens, bacon, cuts of meats and cheeses (prosciutto, salami, mozzarella etc).  Although this is nice and tasty, I spend little time on these and save room for the meat.  

The service is second to none.  From the time we walked in until we left we were treated at the highest caliper.  Opening the door for us both in and out, pulling out our chairs every time we came back to our table.  Putting our napkins on our laps, keeping our drinks full, replacing plates immediately.  And if a napkin hit the floor, a fresh one arrived pronto without ever being asked.  My 5 year old enjoyed this and tested this a few times before we caught on to what he was doing and put a stop to it.  But the staff never let it bother them.  

The table is provided with mashed potatoes (cheese and green onion adorned), fried bananas, rolls, and polenta.  All included.  

The meats were amazing.  Pork with parmesan crusted cheese, bacon wrapped filet, filet medallions, prime rib, garlic steak, sausage, lamb, lamb chops and much more.  

You are given a card, green on one side, red on the other.  If you want meat, you put the green side up and everyone comes running (not actually but close enough) to your table to provide you with whatever you want.  When you have what you want, flip your card to red and enjoy.  When you are ready for more, flip it again.  

This is the place to experiment and try everything.  If you don&#39;t like, leave it and move on."

The salad bar was great as well as the constant flow of well prepared meat. We also enjoyed good wine and desserts and then came the bill. I have no qualms regarding paying for an enjoyable meal but resent the custom of automatically adding a &#34;gratuity&#34; to the bill for parties of six or more. A gratuity by it&#39;s very nature should be the voluntary choice of the diner. I resented the added $ 70.00 to the bill and have decided not to patronize any restaurant that takes the decision to tip or not out of my hands. I tend to tip too much according to my wife.

And the options keep coming. What sets this apart from other brazillian steak houses is, if you refuse a cut of meat, the friendly gauchos ask what you are looking for and they go back and bring you the cut you ask for. The entire staff constantly clear the table and make sure your drink is full and there is nothing left to be needing.

At $50 a person, I would not consider this to be &#34;high end&#34;. Pretty nice but not overly fancy. That said, I have been to high end restaurants all over the world and none have compared to the service we received at this steakhouse. --A sea of perfectly moving parts. Many wait staff members efficiently ensuring that our meal was perfect. Sides were replaced as soon as the last serving was taken. Drinks refilled before they even reached half way. New plates exchanged frequently. Chairs pulled. Napkins placed. Crumbs scraped. We wanted for nothing. 

The meats were outstanding, but I could have eaten just the fried polenta and pao de queijo with the salad bar and been perfectly happy. --You don&#39;t pay $50 and leave your inner carnivore at home though. After this experience, vegan seems quite appealing.

The meat is on part with the other big name Brazilian Steakhouses, but the salad bar is not quite as good.  That is the only reason I didn&#39;t give them 5 stars.

But, the service here, this deserves it&#39;s own paragraph.  They are some of the best servers I&#39;ve ever come across.  It is extremely impressive.  Almost comical how on point they are.  We would literally take a sip out  of our drink and someone was there topping it off.  They would pull my wife&#39;s chair out for her upon returning to the table.  And when that chip was green they flooded the table with meat.  The service is by far the best attribute to this restaurant.

As for the food, we&#39;ll the one thing I can say that stood out in my mind was that when you tell them that you want something rare they will actually give you a rare piece. Or tell you that they will be right back and bring it to you.  I get fairly annoyed at these places when they ask you how you want it, you tell them, and they spin it around as if they are getting you what you asked for, only to cut you the same exact well done piece the person sitting with you got.  Why even ask?

I came for dinner on Christmas eve and it was nicely decorated.  There was a Christmas tree in the waiting area.  After we were seated, the waiter took our drink order and left.  It would have been nice if the waiter explained how the restaurant worked since it was my mom&#39;s first time dinning at a Brazilian steakhouse.  It was my first time here, so I wasn&#39;t quite sure if we can just hit the salad bar right away or what, but my stomach seemed sure.  There were plates stacked on one side of the bar.

There wasn&#39;t anything spectacular at the salad bar, but enough to nibble on.  The asparagus was huge!  On the other hand, the cheese bread they served at the table was amazeball.  Warm, gooey and tasty.  The fried plantains were also good.

I asked someone for a meat list, but they said there wasn&#39;t one.  It would be nice to know what my meat options were.  The meat men were good about coming around when our cards were green.  Some even asked if we were looking for anything specific and would return later with what we had requested.  I asked one of them what was available and he was actually able to rattle off about 9 different meats.  

My favorite meat of the night was the ribeye.  It was juicy and delicious.  The rest were ok - bottom sirloin, house specialty prime sirloin, chicken, pork sausage bacon wrapped filet, filet mignon, pork parmesan, and beef rib."

The BREAD. Oh my god, the bread roll things. They&#39;re crack. I can&#39;t explain. Just eat the bread and you&#39;ll understand.

For the price point (low for a Brazilian steakhouse in my opinion), they really amp up the service here. Although it&#39;s relatively casual (jeans and a polo type of place), waiters pull your chair out for you and place your napkins in your lap :) As far a food goes, everything is always delish! The salad bar has a great assortment of food, including cold vegetables to cut through the richness of the meat, cured meats, cheeses and premade salads. The meats are always rotating, however no matter what you get, everything came out juicy, cooked to your desired temperature (medium rare to medium well, depending on your taste) The sides are probably my favorite and what makes it stand out from other Brazilian steak houses in the area. The fried polenta slices are AMAZING! They&#39;re supper simple....slices of polenta, deep friend, with a sprinkle of parmesan. I&#39;ve tried to make it at home, but nothing compares to this side :) This plus the UNLIMITED cheese puffs that come directly from the oven?? Can&#39;t complain!

Chama Gaucha is an endless parade of meat...delicious steaks, ribs, filets...some of them even wrapped in bacon to ensure extra meatiness.

This was my first true Brazilian steakhouse experience--where you have a coaster that you turn to the red or green side depending on whether or not you want more meat to come your way--and it lived up to the hype and to all the other positive reviews.

The wait staff was friendly, prompt and numerous. You want more garlic sirloin? They&#39;ll send it over. Need more of that melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon? It&#39;ll only be a second.

I was upset at how quickly I filled up, because some of these meats are addictive. You want to just keep going, even though your stomach is sounding the alarm. They also have an incredible salad bar that I wanted to indulge in a bit more, but I couldn&#39;t, because MEAT.

My husband comes for the meat and I love the huge salad bar.  Everything is pristine and clean.  The servers clearly take their job seriously and are attentive to each person at the table.  So many excellent side dishes.  I love the Caprese salad.  We have been there with a larger group and the servers remembered to offer the well done ends to someone at our table.

The meat was delicious. The salad bar had so many options to choose from, and everything provided was perfect. It was super crowded when I went, but the service was still excellent. 

It&#39;s pretty expensive (over $50 per person); go there when you&#39;re very hungry so you can eat your money&#39;s worth. Also, dress nicely; it&#39;s a little fancy."

These are my memories.  This was a fun dinner.  I haven&#39;t been to one of these places since high school prom.  

We waited in the bar for our party to arrive where the bartender, selection and ambiance were on point.  When seated, we met our waiter - he was amazing and  kind, and on top of everything.  The managers are running around in checked dress shirts helping flip tables FAST.  I was in awe just watching them all.  Every employee earns their pay in this place.  Very passionate about what they do.

Now onto the meat!  You get a card next to your plate - you flip it to green when you want meat and red when you want peace.  When it&#39;s green these guys will swarm you like fucking vultures!  It&#39;s kind of hard to believe that they see your little card so quickly.  You have a little set of tongs to grab your meat as they cut your selection.  My faves were the chicken drumsticks and the garlic filet.  SOOOO yummy.  Sides are placed on the table and are included in the price.  You get three carbs - crispy polenta cakes, mashed potato and caramelized bananas.  They were all delicious, but you may not have room for them.  You are way better off sticking to salad and meat, or just meat if you really want to get your monies worth.  However, the little buns and the polenta were the stand outs for sure.   We had one vegetarian friend who just had the salad bar which is about 15 dollars less than the meat dinner, which includes both salad and meat.  Make sure you mention that is what you need.

Desserts were plentiful.  They even have a fancy after dinner drink cart they pull around for you to choose your poison.  We had Frangelico, along with several desserts -- think choc lava cake, cheesecakes with berries and ice cream.  I had the chocolate ice cream with whip.  O M G.  BEST CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM EVERRRRR.  The creamiest most decadent giant scoops of heaven.  So good.  

I would go back for sure.  Fun night out."

Nice open seating arrangement. Good for large family dinners.

Staff is friendly. I was asked for a refill more times than I cared to count. 

Not a place for a regular dine in because Im pretty sure the check for two will be enough for laundry for the year. 
(We didnt check how much it is person for dinner)

All in all Im glad I dont have to drive out to Scumburg, IL or rosemont for a nice brazillian steakhouse.

Happy eating!"

Gives them privacy to eat without making eye contact, and for us to get our salads in privacy back to our seats lol. Since this was a business party, we were put into a private dining area. I felt like it wasn&#39;t really a fair spot? We rarely had a person come in to let us get our shares of meat. Only 2 people came at a time every 30 minutes or so. We don&#39;t get many slices or pieces; yet we finish them so quickly! I feel as if they need to come in more so often due to us having a large number of guests. Service is a bit slow, foods great!

We hadn&#39;t told our server but we believe that one of the Gauchos or bussers must have overheard us wishing our friend a Happy Birthday and Jairo surprised her with a birthday dessert.  Once again, my husband and I were wowed with the exceptional service that Jairo provided to us, coincidentally, he was our server the first time.  Such an outstanding server, you can tell he enjoys his job and knows how to go above and beyond.  The Gauchos are quick on that flip of the card.  Love seeing management on the floor as well.

As far as the meats go, having been the daughter of a butcher, I do know the quality of the meat and Chama Gaucha does provide quality cuts and amazingly provides it on such a high level of quantity of customers.  Meaning, they don&#39;t skimp on the quality for the quantity of people they serve.

I do love the bourbon cart that is pushed around and the nice wine selections the restaurant offers.

We had reservations for 5:45pm and were promptly seated.  The servers came and took our drink order.  We finished the salad bar and everything was still good.  Around dinner service, one of the female servers was removing our plates from the table, but ended up dropping everything from her tray onto the floor.  The plates broke into many pieces right by my chair and feet, and the sauces went everywhere.  They asked if I was okay and I said yes.  My husband was sitting next to me, but no one asked how he was doing.  We later found out that when the plate fell the sauce actually splattered on his blazer.  No one said anything.  We did not notice it until we left the restaurant.  After the plate incident, the servers started to &#34;disappear,&#34; and we really did not have any service.  We ran out of bananas, mashed potatoes, and bread; no one refilled it for us until we finally flagged someone.  It happened to be my birthday that day, and my mother informed the server early on in the dinner service.  We finished our meal and waited over half an hour, but no one removed our dinner plates or brought out dessert for the birthday celebration.  We kept waiting and waiting, but the server was nowhere in sight.  All of a sudden, the hostess gave us the check, so we decided to just leave.  We were very unhappy with the service at this point that no one was in the mood to even ask about the birthday dessert.  Within half an hour of leaving, both my parents had food poisoning.  They both had diarrhea for over an hour.  We suspected it could have been the smoked salmon since my husband and I did not eat any of it, and we were fine.  After spending $250+ and having to endure the lousy service and food poisoning, we do not have any plans to come back.  We used to frequent here during every special occasion; however, we have no more plans of returning.

** Update: I agree. Management has been very responsive to my emails and communication has been good. Arica has been very courteous throughout our communication."

The waitress kept our table clean, our water glasses full, kept an eye on our cocktails, made sure they wete never empty, and suggested good drinks to try. 
When we arrived we were asked if we were celebrating anything special, I said a birthday and at the end of our meal the waiter brings my boyfriend a piece of flan with a candle and the words Happy Birthday written on the plate.

I eat a lot of chicken, but rarely go for any red meat (rarely anything besides chicken). But, the meat here is amazing! 

One of the most important things to know is the red chip/green chip system. Green chip next to your plate means more meat. Red chip means stop with the meat. I recognized this fact maybe after the meat stick men had gone around the table 2-3 times. My favorite choice was the lamb. It was very well seasoned and very tender. I could go back for that alone.

The salad bar is quite extensive. Even for vegetarians, there are tons of options at the salad bar. 

As for drinks, I ordered a capirinha. OMG. I want to drink this drink for the rest of my life. A mojito is usually my go-to drink, but I would gladly trade it in for a capirinha. I can&#39;t wait for it to become trendy, because I would like to be able to get it wherever. 

I didn&#39;t order any dessert, because I was stuffed, but I did opt for a cappucino, which I enjoyed. I&#39;m not sure how much it costs per person (especially for the full service), because I was taken there by a pharm rep. But, if my budget allowed, I might actually return!"

We had reservations and were seated within 5 minutes of reservation time. We were asked what we wanted to drink, to which we replied a wine and cocktail list. 10 minutes went by and no one took our drink order, so off to the salad bar we went. The salad bar was good. Some items that I was not expecting, like a chicken salad. The chicken salad was tasty btw. Food was replenished regularly at the salad bar.

So after salad we realized that no one was coming back for drinks, so we walked to the salad bar and got new plates for the meats. I&#39;m thinking a server should have been on that, but oh well. The meats were good and served in ample portion. When we wanted one that had not come around, we asked a server who went into the kitchen and got someone to bring that one out for us.

The check came before we could order dessert, so we skipped that. We were probably too engorged anyway.

They serve THE sausage I&#39;ve been craving since we got back from São Paulo! I asked and the waiter said they fly a lot of their meats, including the sausage, up from Brazil. You&#39;re not going to find sausage like this in WI or Chicago or wherever. It&#39;s the fat ratio (or maybe lack of) and herbs they use that makes it extremely unique! 
The filet, the chicken, the lamb, the top/bottom sirloin, and yes, the picanha!!! All so good!
They have a smoked salmon on the salad bar that&#39;s AWESOME, as well as a lot of the salad bar. But as my friends in Brazil say, the salad bar is a trap lol. 
It&#39;s a carnivores heaven!
I would say this is on par with Fogo de Chão if not better! And yes I have been to the original Fogo de Chão in São Paulo and the only thing different is the salad bar, which remember kids, is a trap.  

The staff is accommodating, just let them know what kind of meat/cut you&#39;re looking for and they&#39;ll bring it to you as soon as it&#39;s off the flame. Everyone was friendly and our bartender was a doll.
Chama Gaúcha  is a very popular Brazilian Steakhouse in Brazil and they really go out of their way here to provide us with the Brazil experience. I hope this place sticks around forever! 

And yes most of the staff is from Brazil, so it&#39;s an excellent place to have a caipirinha &amp; practice your Portuguese. 

Muito Bom!!! (Very Good)"

It was a bunch of dry macaroni pasta with a teeny bit of some sort of yellow goopy liquid and some sprinkled grated cheese. The Thai curry soup was bland, lukewarm with a few noodles with one slice of mushroom and two thin slivers of red onion. Horrible soup.

It is an &#39;order at the counter and they bring you your food on a tray&#39; type joint, which I have no issues with. Definitely not somewhere you bring to impress someone, more of like a quick lunch situation. 
I love their Bangkok curry with tofu. Tenders veggies on a bed of cabbage and a light serving of noodles in a light curry sauce. It fills you up, but doesn&#39;t weight you down! A good bang for your buck, it is worth a try if you enjoy cheap and cheerful noodle shops!"

However, I think this is by far the worst looking location I have seen! The location is so beautiful that I&#39;m surprised that the inside looks so messy. When we sat at the booth on the seat there was an old noodle, makes you wonder how clean this place is?! Then when the food was brought out to us, it didn&#39;t get any better. My mom and I ordered pulled pork sandwiches with soup. I had the chicken noodle and my mom, the tomato basil. My mom&#39;s soup was all over the outside of the plate, very unpresentable, mine was just bland. On a positive note, the pulled pork was good, the only complaint I had was the portion size. ( On the menu, it looks a lot bigger). Then my boyfriend ordered spaghetti and meat balls. Once again, it was poorly presented. His noodles were hanging off the plate and there was sauce on the outside of the plate. You would think it&#39;s hard to mess up noodles and meat balls but not in this case, it tasted really bland and needed salt! I was very disappointed in this place!

Otherwise, look to one of the myriad other restaurant options.

Noodles &amp; Company seems exclusively populated by teenagers, North Central students, and young families. To say it&#39;s loud and crowded is to say Lake Michigan is a damp puddle. At no hour of the day does it feel quiet except for blizzards or brief lapses between the overturn. 

Large groups should expect to wait outside for a while or find themselves vying with fourteen-year-olds for spots.

I don&#39;t find the idea of sitting with my elbows in another person&#39;s bowl, cramped among a sea of sticky tables and crowded confines to be a comfortable or desirable dining experience. Especially not for $11, which was basically an entree and a drink. If I had to, I&#39;d get N&amp;C products to go. 

They cater and my workplace very occasionally called them up for mac and cheese and spaghetti. I suppose comfort food does well, but their noodles have almost no flavour. Buttery, greasy, oily, or just plain cheesy, yes. But I long to run down to Penzeys Spices and dump a few tablespoons of Pasta Sprinkle, Northwoods Seasoning or Arizona Dreaming into the sauce vats to liven things up a bit. And for the price the restaurant charges, higher than typical fast food, shouldn&#39;t I be entitled to an actual taste? 

For the record, I&#39;m not a food snob. I love spaghetti and rotini to the ends of the earth. Nothing much beats mac and cheese or a tuna casserole on a bitter January morning when I can&#39;t be bothered to cook something fancy. The problem with Noodles and Company is the blandness of their food and the incredibly high sodium content, hellishly busy tablespace, and the pokey service at most crush hours (aka: pretty much 30 minutes after they open until close). 

Parking in downtown Naperville is already challenging enough, and I don&#39;t need a 20 minute wait for spaghetti that&#39;s going to be gluey goo swimming in a watery tomato sauce. 

Pass."

Every time I go, I either order the Steak Stroganoff or the Wisconsin Mac &amp; Cheese.  Both are very creamy and the noodles are cooked to perfection (most of the times).  Sometimes the steak can be a little burnt and the noodles a little undercooked but it doesn&#39;t happen often enough for me to complain.

Restaurant is nice; I appreciate the modern feel to it.  It is pretty crowded most of the times and eating there is a little pricy.

This location is also pretty clean. They are quick to come out and clean off tables as soon as someone leaves and the condiment area remains stocked and organized. My only complaint is that they need more people working here. The other day when we went in there, we watched our food sit for 8 minutes because the poor girl was taking orders at the cash register, helping to prep the food for the cooks, then running the food out to the tables....mind you it was lunch time on a Friday when naturally, it was pretty busy.

When I asked for extra spicy, the counter clerk tried to tell me it was already really spicy.  I had to explain that I hail from the South and my tastebuds have a higher tolerance to spicy foods.  Either she didn&#39;t believe me or the cook was worried about liability, because what I got wasn&#39;t even remotely spicy, but it had good flavor.

For me, it&#39;s &#34;got it all:&#34; great ambience, cool bar (great piano music), unique cocktails, good wine list, lively but cozy atmosphere, great service and wonderful food. I never get bored with this menu no matter what I&#39;m in the mood for. Appetizers for dinner? Entree salad? Something meaty? Salmon? An adorably sized (guilt free!) dessert? Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Those are the reasons that, in an area with myriad restaurant choices, this place stands out. 

The last time we were here I started off with a grapefruit negroni. Different! The base was a housemate grapefruit shrub - a tad overwhelming - plus Compari and gin. Then on to the Sesame Grilled Salmon salad. I love the way the salads (and some of the cocktails, notably the Old Fashioned) are presented at the table: a cylinder of dressed lettuce is swirled out onto the plate in a very entertaining fashion. The salmon, perfectly grilled, was off to the side, which I prefer, as were the other components of the salad. The desserts, though - I usually never order them out but these are mini-shooters of various imaginative concoctions, just the right ending to a satisfying meal. Great experience here, every time, without breaking the bank, either."

I made reservations through open table and made them aware of his birthday.  Every server that stopped at our table mentioned his birthday; no other restaurant has done this before.  And to sweeten our visit, they took a picture of us, gave it to us and paid for his desert(which was in a shot glass) delicious.  

The food was seasoned well and the presentation was spot on.  The ambiance was romantic, the kitchen area is visible to customers (Gordon Ramsay style)

Prepared perfectly with grilled carrots. The roasted potatoes were a little over cooked and dry, but the rest of the meal made up for them.  Someone ordered the salmon.

The portions are perfectly sized and you don&#39;t feel like you&#39;re cheating on your diet. Unless you&#39;re me and never diet. The decor in this place is pretty terrible though, feels very old although it&#39;s pretty new. They do have a piano player not sure when exactly they play but it&#39;s pretty nice while you&#39;re at the bar.

You can never go wrong w/ the appetizers here. I think I&#39;ve had every single one and loved them all. The servers are super informative so ask any question and I am almost sure they&#39;ll have an answer for you!

Flatbreads are another personal favorite. The have a lobster flatbread in season right now that is pretty amazing. Super dynamic taste and incredibly fresh. If seafood isn&#39;t your jam, then opt for the steak.. you won&#39;t regret!

Lastly, the DESSERTS are the best! Little portions that guarantee you will not leave any cake/cheesecake/chocolate behind. The smores is my favorite, the graham cracker dipped in chocolate is the perfect ending to my delicious meal."

Phenomenal menu.  So the cool thing is they change their menu every season.  They have their spring menu, summer, fall and winter menu in terms of their entrees.  They have a list of other delectable dishes that change weekly (52 weeks in a year).  Hence Seasons 52!! (Sweet concept).  The restaurant is beautiful! Super clean and beyond classy and absolutely gorgeous restaurant.  It&#39;s warm and inviting, it truly is an exceptional place to eat.

Ordered the Lobster flatbread as starter: chunks of lobster meat, cheese on a very thin almost cracker like crust.  Trust me when I say, it&#39;s the best flatbread I have ever tasted.  For entrees, ordered the Cedar Plank Salmon, the Atlantic Sockeyed Salmon, Asian glazed Chilean seabass, the Rainbow trout, and finally the Sea scallops.  All served with seasonal spring veggies and risotto or wild rice.  I cannot describe how FRESH AND CLEAN the fish dishes were.  All had no trace of stinky fish smell  whatsoever.  It is EXACTLY how fish should taste.  The portion is perfect. If you choose to have dessert (which you totally should), they do not have a dessert menu.  They have what they call mini desserts, so just perfectly portioned tastings of desserts in shot glasses.  Ahhhhhh the presentation is just beautiful! 

Our waitress was awesome.  Great service, super attentive and she gave us a picture souvenir of our family.  It was a great memory of our dining experience and birthday celebration.  Hospitality and service was exceptional.  This was the best dining experience I&#39;ve ever had, no joke.

Just a tidbit: make reservations especially on the weekend.  Even for 2 people because if you go here without RSVPing, your wait can be as long as 45 minutes to an hour.  Phone ahead!"

I would stay this time was much better than my first experience. We shared a lot of plates and had a lot of really great tasting food. We experienced the crab and shrimp stuffed mushrooms (best thing we ate), the shrimp scampi skillet (the worst thing we ate, it was like warm should have been hotter), the lobster flatbread (it was okay, but not mind blowing for the price), the crab wedge salad (recommend) and the key lime cup (highly recommend).

I had the potato leek soup and the amaretto shooter off their spring 2016 menu. I would highly recommend both.

Server John R was very attentive and caring. 

My only complaint about this location is I always get seated 15 minutes after my reservation time. Could be worse, could be better, but not a deal breaker. 

I recommend joining their email list if you want coupons every few months. They don&#39;t send a lot of emails which is nice."

So one week you may get asparagus, the next, beets. The food is delicious, and the portions are just right. I love the fact that they put the calorie counts on the menu so you know what you are getting!

When you first walk in the place is calm, dimly lit, very relaxing. Only once I had to wait for a table. There is a large bar area that you can sit, which I did once, and the service was so quick. Usually I sit in the dining area, which has large or small tables, and some comfy booths. The service is great, the staff that has waited on me has always had this excitement about the menu and what they are serving. I have tried their small plates menu and just about everything on their menu during different seasons. I have never been disappointed. One of my favorites is the seabass and black rice. Even though the dish is served with mushrooms (which I am allergic to), I have never had an issue with allergens. Their shrimp and grits is pretty delightful too. I could go on and on about the menu. The flatbreads are delicious and wonderful to share as an appetizer. 

The desserts come out in a shot glass and are the most fun part of the evening. The almond cake or the key lime pie are my top 2 go to desserts. I&#39;ve tried them all, and haven&#39;t been disappointed. Even their pecan pie tastes like home!  Definitely try this place out. Worth it! And sometimes there is even music in the bar area."

My son and I enjoyed lunch at Seasons 52 today.  We were greeted warmly by the two hostesses and our server, Heather.  Heather was fantastic from her upbeat attitude, attentive service and friendliness.  My son and I shared the deviled eggs and my go-to appetizer, the tuna tartare.  I always love the layers of flavor in the tuna tartar with the avocado, mango salsa and sushi grade tuna.  The deviled eggs were a first for me, creamy, flavorful and a touch of bacon.  Yum!  I had the lobster BLT lettuce wraps for lunch with a side of fuji apple slaw.  The slaw was way too tangy for me so I didn&#39;t eat it and the BLT was fresh and light.  My son enjoyed his wood grilled filet with red wine sauce and Heather substituted asparagus for the mushrooms with no problem upon request.  Unfortunately, something occurred today which did not bode well for my son or me when he relayed what happened.  A chef exited a stall in the men&#39;s bathroom and went right out the door without washing his hands!  That is a major problem when e.coli can be transmitted very easily if kitchen staff do not take caution in washing their hands after using the bathroom.  I hope the management will stress the importance of cleanliness when handling food in their restaurant.  Major turnoff!"

My fiancé and I came to Seasons 52 as part of Restaurant Week. I can safely say that they secured two return customers after our wonderful experience last night. 

We had a reservation for 8:00pm and we checked in with the hostess at 7:45pm. It was a lively and busy Friday night, and I overheard the hostess tell some folks without reservations the wait was approaching 2 hours. Yikes! We were understandably concerned after hearing that announcement.  Much to our delight, we were seated precisely at 8.  

The atmosphere was dark, warm, and romantic. It was quite compact inside the dining room, but the volume was lower than average.  After looking at the menu, it was nice to see all of the options are relatively healthy. The majority of options fell below 500 calories each.   

We started with the Garlic Pesto Chicken flatbread.  This flatbread is built on an ultra-thin crust covered in fresh mozzarella cheese, balsamic onions, arugula and roasted red peppers. The flatbread was fresh and delicious.  The fact that the crust was so thin made this an outstanding opening dish, while at the same time not filling us up to the point of not being able to enjoy the rest of the dinner. It was a perfect balance. 

Next, we both decided on the Spinach Salad for our next course. It consisted of spinach, pear, Gorgonzola cheese, sherry-walnut vinaigrette. I absolutely loved the taste of the toasted walnuts. 

For my entrée, I ordered the Filet Mignon medium rare.  I can say this was one of the best steaks I&#39;ve ever tasted! It was cooked and seasoned to perfection.  It was tender and soft.   If I didn&#39;t have teeth, I would still be able to eat it. As an added bonus, there were no fatty parts on this cut at all.  My sincerely compliments to the chef!

Dessert was quite unique! Our waiter brought out an assortment of &#34;Mini Indulgences.&#34; Essentially, they are double-shot glasses filled with different kinds of desserts that you eat like a mini-sundae. I am a sucker for chocolate, so I chose the Belgian Chocolate S&#39;more indulgence.  This included a mini chocolate cake, chocolate mousse, chocolate chips, toasted marshmallow, and a chocolate dipped graham cracker. All of these ingredients fit neatly into a dish the size of a double-shot glass. This dessert was unbelievable.  Quite honestly, I&#39;m happy this was a  &#34;mini&#34; dessert because if there was a king-sized version I wouldn&#39;t be able to help myself.  

I&#39;d like to make special note of our waiter. Our waiter, Sherard, was an absolute pleasure.  I could tell Sherard enjoys what he does, as his enthusiasm and kindness are genuine.  We never waited long for a refill on our drinks.  He was knowledgeable about the restaurant and the menu, and made solid recommendations that helped guide our choices. He was charismatic and we enjoyed talking to him. Quite simply, the service demonstrated by Sherard made this an all-around 5-star experience. 

To the management - if you&#39;re reading this, you should know that Sherard has locked in two return customers. Just know that with servers like him, you will always be successful. 

I will definitely come back.  They have a new iteration of their menu each week (hence the name Seasons 52), and I am looking forward to seeing more of what they have to offer."

60 minutes later we still were not seated. I asked the manager how many people were ahead of us and I also saw that some who just showed got seated. I was a bit confused by that. 

The answer was appalling. 10 people were ahead of us. 10. Not 3. Not 4. But 10. After 60 minutes of waiting for our reservation. I understand stuff happens. But be honest with your customers! There were many who walked out and left that night and many who waited over 75 minutes who also had reservations.  The managers were acting very snooty and had zero customer service skills.

The restaurant itself is 3 stars, but the pianist/singer they had was so good I&#39;m adding a star. Seriously, as a classical musician I can&#39;t tune out the bad ones and regularly have to leave places over crummy musicians.  
So, the food..... it was fresh - as anything in this price range should be. Beyond that...... nothing. The menu was safe and boring. The entrées and appetizers were uninspiring and predictable.  The portions were small..... but the food was done well.  There was nothing bad about the food, it just wasn&#39;t all that good. 

No one in my party got anything bad but no one was happy with anything but the live music.  The food doesn&#39;t give you any reason to come here."

This restaurant does not have any complementary bread &amp; I think that is something to take note of as I always look forward to eating bread anywhere I dine. Aside from that, the chef&#39;s suggested lobster flatbread was delicious with a hint of lemon that I could have done without. I ordered the half chicken, with your veggies I would suggest asking them not to put so much parsley (or whatever it was) on your food. Mashed potatoes were a winner. The lobster pappardelle was also a hit &amp; you get a good amount of lobster with it but way too many peas."

The food was great our server Michael was awesome. We waited for our first drink for over 5 minutes and it is quite pricey ...but it was excellent.  The prices as i said were high but they delivered and was worth the cost. We stayed for 4  hrs great atmosphere.  The Flatbread outstanding ....trout outstanding ..scallops the same. 

Loved it"

We walked in the door and were promptly seated and given menus. Ordered drinks with no issues  and looked over the menu. Wife ordered some type of lettuce wrap thing with a seafood sauce or some shit. I got the southern grits and shrimp. 

Food arrived quickly and was presented nice. She took a few bites of her wrap and said it tasted really bad. I took a bite and thought it tasted like nasty seafood with lettuce ( I hate seafood). We told our waiter that she didn&#39;t like it and we wanted to order a flatbread instead. I even offered to pay for the wrap b/c it&#39;s not the restaurants fault that the wife did not like it. They were cool about it and took it off the bill for us. Score. 

My shrimp and grits were really good. But then I found a long blond hair mixed in the grits. Deal breaker? Nah, I&#39;ve had worse in my mouth I&#39;m sure so I just pulled the hair out and kept eating. Luckily the hair was long so I hope it was a head hair and not a &#34;different&#34; kind of hair.  I didn&#39;t even complain about it. They brought my wife a flatbread to replace the wrap and she said it was really good. 

I did notice a lot of those little flies buzzing around. Like the kind you get when you don&#39;t clean well. Also, the furniture and wood work in the dinning room area was really banged up. Most everything was black and looks beat up from dents and dings. Some paint would go a long way. Would we go back? Yeah probably if in the area but we won&#39;t be driving out there for that. 

I will say the service was very good and all staff members were very nice."

Our previous 2 years were at the closed downtown location. I made our reservation (for 12) in late September. 
When we arrived at the restaurant last evening at 6:15 for our 6:30 reservation there were patrons stuffed into every square inch of the very minimal waiting space. When I checked in our reservation with the desk manager, I was told that reservations were running AT LEAST an hour or more late due to &#34;diners overstaying&#34; and everything getting backed up. We weren&#39;t the only livid people in that bedlam. I inquired why they didn&#39;t request that people leave when finished and was told that was not their policy.
Realistically, with the size of the crowd, we would have been lucky if we were seated by 8. There were so many people waiting (many for over an hour) ahead of us that the entire restaurant would have been filled again before we were ever seated. The desk manager clearly was overwhelmed but in all fairness, acted as if she could have cared less about everyone&#39;s dilemma.
This situation was not only 100% inappropriate, but it was a complete failure of management. It is obvious that they either overbooked and/or lost control of walk-ins filling tables and then overstaying.
As this is not the only restaurant in Oakbrook Center, we got on the phone and were able to secure an immediate reservation. I&#39;m sure the staff at Seasons were thrilled that we cancelled and walked out. As we dined at the other restaurant, we observed several other tables of people who walked out of their Seasons reservations.
This entire experience needs no more explanation than to say, &#34;Seasons; you really blew it.&#34; I will NEVER patronize your restaurant again."

We had reservations, but the kitchen was so backed up, everyone had to wait 30-45 minutes to be seated. I understand that things like this happen, especially on holidays, but I felt bad for all the elderly people waiting with no where to sit. Our waitress was very nice and gave us a free flatbread appetizer on the house. I had the chilean sea bass, which was very good. My mom had the grilled scallops, which she also enjoyed. The guys had new york strip steaks and they surprisingly finished all of it. We ordered 3 of their mini desserts. I thought the small dessert size was a good idea since you can try many different things, but it probably defeats the purpose of trying to eat healthier since you end up ordering a bunch anyway. 

Overall, the food was pretty good and the live pianist was entertaining. I was expecting this restaurant to be nicer, though. It definitely felt like a chain restaurant. The menus were worn-out and the tabletops were slippery and felt kinda grimy, like at Olive Garden."

We then ordered and finished the rest our meal (plank salmon and pork tenderloins are great), desserts included, and he surprised us by insisting the meal would be complimentary. It must have been a $70 meal, but to give it to us free because of a delayed wait? Priceless service."

Low light and live musician at the bar. Got to sit all the way in back of restaurant so a lot more quiet then it might be closer to the bar.
Menu changes per season and week which is pretty cool. So I can&#39;t recommend a dish since it might be available when you go. We got crab cake appetizer, wood grilled filet mignon that was really good and caramelized Grilled sea Scallops that were AMAZING.

 I will recommend to GET DESSERT! Options are in small glasses that comes in a cute tower and is the perfect serving. We got the Belgium chocolate s&#39;more and mocha macchiato. Which were both sooo good."

It&#39;s not the cheapest place nor the fanciest, but it a celebratory feel to it. I&#39;ve been to the one near LA which was equally as fun, and I love the seasonal theme. 

There is plenty of room unlike some of the nicer restaurants in downtown Chicago so you can spread out and really get comfortable. After a few overpriced glasses of wine, you&#39;ll be having a terrific time. 

The food is just okay. It&#39;s way way way better than the average restaurant, but nothing is terribly memorable, but at least you get a story behind what you are eating. The furniture is comfy and the ambiance is dark and romantic. The staff is also very courteous and efficient. It&#39;s definitely a restaurant that you don&#39;t have to worry about anything at.

On my most recent visit here, we were seated in Dierdre&#39;s section and can I just say, here is a server who makes it happen!

She was great with wine suggestions, even finding a bottle that a friend had asked specifically for that wasn&#39;t on the regular list.  And my food, with all of it&#39;s crazy requests, eliminations and additions, came to the table perfectly prepared and delicious!

Their social media person had reached out to me given my last review but I hadn&#39;t had time to get back to her yet before this visit.  But no worries as our server was on it, the manager, Julie, was exceptionally welcoming and nice and our evening went off flawlessly.

The dining room was nearly full so it was impossible to have a conversation across the table.  It was hard to hear our server.

Service was mostly good but the food was disappointing.  We started with two glasses of wine.  One of the wine glasses had a chipped base.  At this price point I don&#39;t expect chipped glassware. It&#39;s an indication that they don&#39;t really pay attention to detail.  Next we had the caprese salad.  It consisted of three large slices of an heirloom tomato topped with slices of breaded mozzarella.  The tomato slices were from the same tomato.  They had almost no flavor.  One slice from three different varities of tomatoes would have made a much better dish.  This is peak season for heirloom tomatoes.  I was expecting more.  The menu said &#34;herb encrusted&#34; mozzarella.  &#34;Herb encrusted&#34; turns out to mean breaded.  If I wanted breaded mozzarella I would have gone to Friday&#39;s.  

For entrees we had the beef short rib and the pork tenderloin.  The short ribs were served in a shallow crock like dish.  The dish hadn&#39;t been warmed so the meat was barely above room temperature.  We had to ask for a regular dinner plate so we could get the food out of the crock so we could cut it.  The pork tenderloin came in a very warm dish.  The pork was overcooked and dry.  It was a large chunk that was cut into three smaller chunks.  This might make for a better presentation but it also means the meat is going to dry out.  The teaspoon or so of sauce in the bottom of the plate was flavorful but insufficient to help the dry meat.

Our server came by after we got our entrees.  She didn&#39;t ask how the food was, she asked how we were doing.  The two mini-desserts were OK.

Bottom line: Seasons 52 doesn&#39;t deliver for their price point.  The service was just OK.  The food was disappointing.  They use the calorie thing as an excuse for giving you small portions."

I&#39;d recommend specific items but since the menu changes weekly....I don&#39;t want to disappoint you. Get flatbread anything and you will be happy, everyone I have tried has been delicious and there&#39;s always new interesting flavor combinations.

I believe they are keeping some of the soups the same for most of the season. Get the mushroom. You&#39;re welcome. Skip the butternut squash unless you like the taste of sweetened baby food. That&#39;s the only menu item that fell flat for our table.

Service was great though, they replaced the soup and the manager even came out to talk to us about why we didn&#39;t like the soup and ask for feedback on how to improve it. That was awesome. 

Our waitress was friendly, attentive and just simply rocked. It was my friend birthday and without asking she brought out an amazing desert tower with a candle on top! We each had a desert cup that we picked from the tower and omg was it delicious. Our waitress took a picture without us asking her to, went to the back and printed out a hard copy for each of us. That simple gesture was so nice and definitely made it a very memorable experience for us."

But our experience last night was average.  We had a large party and a reservation, but four folks were running late so we started the evening with a drink in the bar.  Both of our drinks were fantastic.  Mine was a Hawaiian Punch Martini and my husbands a Pear &amp; a Thyme cocktail.
From here, everything was fine, but for the price I was expecting much more.  The appetizers were tiny and the shrimp scampi was pretty much a bunch of saucy tomatoes and a few tiny shrimp.  The stuffed mushrooms were really sliced in half, and more shrimp than shroom.  
For our entrees we had a range of proteins.  The fish, lamb, steak, and lobster were all perfectly cooked and seasoned.  However, all of the vegetables were not good.  Nobody ate the burnt Brussel Sprouts or dehydrated carrots.  Even the lobster Mac and cheese was average at best.  
I also ordered a second martini that was citrus and great, but the timing was very poor.  My brother in law waited fifteen minutes for a Sprite refill.  
Overall, I think this restaurant is fine, but not worth the high prices.

I had the lump crab cake for an appetizer and a braised beef rib sandwich w/ quinoa salad for my entree. The crab cake was excellent! My sandwich was also really good but I wasn&#39;t a fan of the sauce it came with. The quinoa could&#39;ve been better.

I guess to keep the calories under 495 .....
* The Lobster Lettuce Wrap.. hardly any lobster and no flavor to it at all. Canned?  It should be called &#34;Lettuce Wrap with Lettuce and a hint  of Lobster&#34; .
* Mahi Mahi Tacos.  The mahi-mahi was decent but overwhelmed dressing on the lettuce bed in the taco shell.  It was more like a salad in a taco shell with a piece of mahi laid over it.  It was decent enough piece of mahi-mahi while maintaining their 495 calorie goal.

Great drinks. Every meal I have ordered has been fantastic and seasoned perfectly. My boyfriend also has enjoyed his meals. My lady friends and I enjoy a nice dinner out with great drinks, and as they visit town, this is one of the places I will be suggesting and/or taking friends and family as they visit the area from out of town. 

I prefer a more quiet atmosphere with nice acoustics, so as not to have any surprising or loud noises when spending a nice meal with a friend. 

I have been to some very nice steak houses, and this place fits the bill very well with me as a tasty restaurant with plenty of selections. The ambiance is tasteful, classy, intimate, and romantic.

For romantic / private dinners, try to reserve a booth. Those are more private and intimate than a table toward the front of the restaurant. But the tables are also nice if you must. I have sat toward the front of the restaurant, and while they are all nice seats, the tables toward the front would be more for a business lunch or dinner.

I&#39;ve gone in the afternoon and at night, and Seasons 52 was just perfect! The service was perfect 1. in the amount they approach. Not too much, not too little. 2. Happy to serve, not awkward at all. Staff is extremely approachable.

The menu rotates seasonally and all of the menu items are calorie conscious and reasonable portions. Their wine list is good and it&#39;s easy to have a nice night out here.

I was dining alone on a work trip, so I sat at the bar. The bar was very busy and there was only one (SOMETIMES two) people behind the bar. The bartender was making all of the drink orders for servers at tables and taking care of the people at he bar, so my service was pretty poor. I had to flag the waitress down to place an order or ask a question.

The food was good and the server who brought my food out was very helpful and attentive, which made up for the poor service at the bar. I enjoyed a kale Caesar salad and a chicken pesto flatbread.

No trip to Seasons 52 is complete without DESSERT. The dessert shots are the perfect portion and always so amazingly delicious. I love the variety they present. I had a Belgium chocolate s&#39;mores shot and I left very happy. 

Overall, Seasons food is good and service is typically good as well. The staff know the menu items and can knowledgeably answer questions and make recommendations. The service (particularly at the bar) of the Oakbrook establishment was not at the level I would expect out of Seasons, but I would give it a second try next time I&#39;m in the area."

You can make a reservation, but it means nothing when you get to the restaurant because they take walk-ins ahead of you and they allow people to sit at a table as long as they want. We walked in last night, Thanksgiving evening, at 6 PM for our 6:30 reservation. I was told that it would be at least an hour wait if not more even though we had a reservation. There were masses of people in the entryway giving the appearance of utter chaos and other frustrated diners like us. We left and went to a restaurant around the corner and had a wonderful experience. The same thing happened to us last year at Thanksgiving at the same restaurant and my family and I will never set foot in a seasons 52 restaurant again. They have lost our business. What is the point of making a reservation if you still have to wait an exorbitant amount of time to be seated?"

Well this exactly what happened with me.. On my birthday, we decided to have a fine dining at Season 52,which is quite famous and highly rated by most of the people. After going through the reviews, I was very much excited and made my reservations..
For appetizers Duck wing Lollipops were my first choice along with Garlic pesto chicken flatbread. Firstly,they took a lot of time to bring the appetizers and secondly the lollipops were too sweet,very tender but sweetness had overcome the rest of the flavors.. Flatbread was good in taste but it was too soggy. 
Coming to entrees, we had Maple glazed all natural Roasted half chicken and grilled swordfish. Maple glazed chicken was simply delicious,it was properly cooked.. The only word for grilled swordfish is Overcooked. 
As though this much wasn&#39;t enough..,,,,
I opted for a Mango Jalapeño Crush..and I was only able to taste the jalapeño.. It was too spicy,no flavors of mango,cilantro,cucumber or gin,Only jalapeños !!!! I couldn&#39;t had it more than a sip so I ordered another drink.. 
At last, it was dessert time.. I really loved the concept of serving desserts in shots..  We had tiramisu and key lime pie, both were appetizing. 
Overall, this wasn&#39;t what I have expected. The service was too slow and food was below average for me."

Here&#39;s why- the ambience is great. Another beautiful restaurant in oak brook with an abundance of dark Wood and nice tables. The servers are friendly enough and refilled my water promptly. I was untold of the special they had with the the 5$ small plates... 
So we ordered the scallopes small plate a shrimp small Plate and they were both very good. The shrimp was large enough for two. The scallops were small and only three. 
We also ordered the blue cheese n steak flatbread. The steak was ok. Some parts cold. The cheese was good.

For our entree we had ordered the mahi special and shrimp cavatappi. The pasta really left me indifferent.  It was simply ok. Nothing really flavorful. 

The pasta was weird with non traditional pasta noodles. The shrimp was plentiful but the flavor was lacking. My mahi was blackened good but def a bit too crispy. I thought everything was cooked a bit much. I mean how hard is it too cook a mahi filet haha altho the fish had a nice salsa on top. 

The vegetables though, ugh. The broccolini was also chewy My sweatpatatoes were luke warm beginning to cool off. I think everything could&#39;ve used a bit more spice. How could the Veggies he chewy n unseasoned at a &#39;health food&#39; place ha

The service was ok. Wasn&#39;t too shabby. Didn&#39;t have a empty water glass but I did not like how we had 2 servers. The one never introduced himself and the other one simply asked how we thought the food was immediately as we began to eat it... Took 20 mins for appetizer. 20 to place dinner order and 10 to cook 

The overall bill was $110 with a good tip!!! No booze, one lemonade. With this in mind I expect to be at Pappadeaux, wildfire, devon etc They give you so much more food. And the flavors explode!!!!!! Fr tat price. Also got 5$ overcharged..."

Everytime I have come I have left pleased. The menu changes per season for what is fresh and what is Local. The menu is always large enough where I have to find myself asking the servers for their suggestions because I cannot make up my mind! Which takes me to my next point the servers and staff are knowledgable on the menu and make great recommendations too! 

The Idea is fresh, local and new. Different foods for different seasons. Plus not to mention they have a lot of gluten free options as well as plates under 600 or something calories. Which is nice for those who tend to track or keep track of that. 

The drinks are also great and have low calorie options.

Never been disappointed here. Great little ambiance as it can be casual or a little upscale too! 
Love the little piano behind the bar!"

I have now been here twice and both times the food and the service were so great.  The concept of this restaurant is to use fresh ingredients in healthy delicious ways.
I have usually tried the seafood and it has all been amazing. The fish dishes especially are simply made and they have great flavor. I like the portion sizes, it&#39;s enough to eat in one sitting and feel full. It&#39;s not supersized by any means, but that adds to the charm of this place.  The appetizers are really great too, I have tried the flat breads which are really tasty, the artichoke which is simple but delicious, and the small salads are really great as well. Right now they have a watermelon tomato feta salad that was really amazing, sweet, tangy, crunchy creamy.. i wish i would have brought one home..  The menu is always changing depending on what is fresh and available.
The restaurant itself is beautiful. Dimly lit, deep rich woods on the walls but it is very comfortable and inviting. 
From a price stand point, it is not cheap for certain, you&#39;ll at least spend $20 on your entree and then sides and all are pricey as well. If you are looking for great food that is prepared to the best of its potential and something classy, visit seasons 52 you won&#39;t be disappointed."

We went to the Seasons 52 place and it was nice. A bit dark but nice, upscale and a light touch of class. We got a comfortable booth, close to the bar (The whole place was quite large sized and I noticed other large rooms, lots of mahogany styled wood). I liked that they have food choices for sensitive stomachs (gluten free/vegan/vegetarian etc.). Also the menu changes a bit each week. The main feature is clearly that many entrees/appetizers/cocktails  are each a little different in the sense the preparations were &#39;nouveau&#39; gastronomically. For example, one appetizer we tried was lobster razor thin flat-bread, topped with fresh mozzarella, chopped scallions &amp; roasted sweet red peppers. They did have a wide selection of wines, including my favorite red - Chianti from Tuscany, Italy - but we skipped all the booze and instead tried several varieyy of little things, to get the maximum experience.

I tried a cup of the summer corn soup which had bits of bacon in it, chopped chives, along with a tiny loaf of garlic bread (so tiny that they looked cute). To wash it down I stayed with a simple iced tea. Then we tried the main entree: Asian glazed Chilean sea bass, with black rice, shiitake mushroom, snap peas and topped with wasabi leaves. We ordered a number of little sides, so we could sample a wide spectrum such as:

    grilled chipotle-spiced chicken skewers, served on a bed of tomatillo salsa,
    goat cheese ravioli, lightly brushed with tomato and sweet basil
    Korean red chili glazed duck wing &#39;lollipops&#39; crusted with sesame seeds and finally
    skillet of roasted corn

Although the portions were small, we felt nice and comfortably full, so we had to skip dessert :-). I did ask to see the dessert menu and they brought out the actual dessert display (picture enclosed). These are actually small portions of standard dessert with only a subtle touch in their presentation (a few I can remember were: Creme Brulee, Blueberries with Lemon Curd, Raspberry Chocolate Chip Cannoli, etc). 

We had a real live piano player! The prices were actually quite normal, not at all outrageous (perhaps due to intense competition nearby).

Overall I thought it was very very decent. A place where I go again and take my SO as well."

We were given a buzzer and sat around to wait until 8 PM for our table.

Once seated, we had our server, Tony, assist us. He gave a quick run through with the menu since it was both of our first time at Seasons 52. This restaurant has a different menu every week, hence 52 weeks = 52 menus. They highlight food that are in season so when I went, they had specials of scallops and winter veggies, etc that are only available in the winter. Also, all their food are 475 calories or less! So this is definitely a good healthy option if you want to eat out at a nice fancy dinner.

For appetizers, we got the chicken flatbread and caramelized brussel sprouts. The food came out pretty quickly which was good since we were both starving.

The flatbread was really good, bell pepper, chicken, and arugula were a good blend and we enjoyed it thoroughly.

The brussel sprouts had a bit of bacon in it and it was a great filling healthy option for appetizers.

I had the rainbow trout and my friend had the pork tenderloin. He really liked the sauce of the pork tenderloin and my fish was healthy. Since the trout was grilled, you can taste a bit of burnt meat around the edge which threw off my taste buds but overall, it was yummy. 

For dessert, Tony brought out about 10 options of mini shot glass desserts for us to pick from. We were just going to share one but Tony encouraged us to get two. We reluctantly picked the carrot cake and the raspberry one. I thought the carrot cake was way too sweet but the raspberry w/ cinnamon cannoli was delish! I def recommend that one.

Overall, the ambience is dim light and very romantic and classy. All healthy options for dinner. Great service. Total bill came out to about $60 for 2!"

So lets just say the bar was set high. And no better day than Mother&#39;s Day to visit when you&#39;ve got dining companions you want to really treat out.  

It was just me, my son, my mom, my aunt and my MIL and we enjoyed our visit very much.  We all have have varied tastes and S52 had a lot to offer all of us.

We all loved that the menu is seasonal, using the best each season has to offer.  And although the menu items are less than 500 calories, the variety is excellent.  It&#39;s not just chicken and salad.  

They offer a nice array of house cocktails too.  My strawberry basil infusion cocktail was refreshing and tasty.  

Everyone&#39;s dish looked really good.  The presentation was pretty and everything was super fresh and well-made. 

I opted for the asparagus soup with lemon chantilly cream to start--it was so good. Super fresh, light and full of flavor.  My main dish was the lump crab wedge salad with a mustard dressing and yuzu vinaigrette. Another winner--very fresh and all the flavors worked well together.

We each got a different mini dessert to pass around and share and my favorite would have to be the cappuccino cream.   Worth mentioning was that we all received a complimentary amuse bouche prior to our meal and a decadent chocolate truffle at the end of our meal.  Such little touches were greatly appreciated. 

S52 is the only place where I&#39;ve received multiple emails and phone calls reminding me of my reservation. I get why, but it&#39;s kind of overkill.  Also the hostesses were not very friendly, more detached and haughty.  Thank goodness our server was super nice or else I&#39;d totally write off visiting again no matter how much I liked the food. 

Complimentary Valet. Gorgeous and comfy interior.  All the moms (including me) had a great visit."
seasons-52-oak-brook,A M.,AJdInyVLbfIx3DDfOaDU_g,"Elmwood Park, IL",0,1,0,0,81,vnddBIDyQxvjslwTXj9nQA,2.0,2015-12-19,"Scene: Packed at 7pm Friday night at Oak Brook Center the week before Christmas. 

Gal Pal and I head to the bar, find two empties on the back side of a very bustling scene. We see four bartenders working the crazy loopy J shaped bar working before we discover the reason why the seats were empty: Interior of the bar is a guy, seated and singing while playing an electric piano. We are right behind him. In fact, read Kavita B&#39;s post and in her photo of the bar you will see a guy to the right in the gray jacket. Look closely and you&#39;ll see the microphone! You won&#39;t see the enormous Brandy Snifter full of 5&#39;s which we wonder how they got in there.

We&#39;ve seen enough episodes of Bar Rescue to know that being able to make eye contact with your customers is key to a bartender&#39;s cash flow. Its pretty clear this crew has mentally erased these seats from their view. For those brave enough to attempt it (there are a few) its a trick to maneuver around this keyboard and guy who is literally in the center of the interior of the bar.  

Gal Pal and I comment about cleanliness, health inspection, and dangers of the electricity needed to power the piano among the liquids. Clearly, management sees nothing wrong with this setup. Behind us is an empty corner round table that, if removed, would certainly be a better place for entertainment.  Its not making money sitting empty, that&#39;s for sure.

Gal Pal and I consider leaving but she has 2 complimentary appetizer coupons received from the Schaumburg location given, she tells, because of the terrible service she received there and wants to chance it. So we wait...and wait... no one will look at us. Calling for someone is futile as &#39;The Entertainment&#39; has the audio on blast because the bar is busy, and after all, HE is the center of attention, don&#39;t you forget that.

Seated next to us is an elderly couple who, it seems, have been nursing the same glass of wine for a good long time as they are unable to get anyone&#39;s attention to get a bill.

Much to our surprise, a dishwater blonde bartender appears, leaning into the space in front of us to inquire what we want to drink. Gal Pal specifies her Cosmo request in a tall glass with extra juice. I go for an orange martini. She has the coupons on the bar top and before we could say &#39;menu please&#39; Blonde is out of sight. We agree conversation was going to be tough, but &#39;The Entertainment&#39; takes a break and the noise level is more tolerant. We watch the added floor show of &#39;The Entertainment&#39; stretching his giant frame and complaining how his back hurts.

Drinks arrive (they were not prepared in front of us), and begging to get the menu, we get them minutes later long arm handed to us across the bar. We give her a pass, maybe she was tired. But Gal Pal&#39;s drink is not made to her satisfaction, and my martini is absolutely unbalanced and undrinkable. A brief discussion is had and flatbread ordered. Gal Pal is handed a small glass of juice for a &#39;do it yourself&#39; adjustment, and I get a different drink plopped in front of me without even seeing it prepared. Blonde disappears. Menus stay with us because, well, its seems too hard for Blonde to attempt to try to collect them.

Gal Pal revokes the earlier &#39;tired&#39; pass as she slowly pours the juice and comments that we will never see Blonde again. Her prediction is correct.

&#39;The Entertainment&#39; has returned, now fully engaged with a roster of holiday classics mixed with Elton John and Billy Joel tunes, all sung with the same monotone inflection, at a level that wipes out any chance to engage with the bartenders or others at the bar. Server appears with flatbreads, burnt. No chance to tell anyone, as &#39;The Entertainment&#39; is in full swing and Blonde is now squatting on the floor taking inventory of the coolers at the far end of the bar. Clearly, serving guests is not her strong suit.  

We make the best of the &#39;complimentary&#39; food, remembering this coupon was for the prior bad service, and wondering if anyone will ever bring the bill to the elderly couple as they are still waiting for someone to acknowledge them.

We watch as the bartenders serve everyone else at the bar. Blonde never returns to ask if the food or drinks were now acceptable. In fact, it takes a new face whose attention we break from her intent on cleaning the portable fridge to ask for the bill.  

She with the cleaning towel, returns with a bill for us and the bill for the elderly couple. We find that Blonde did not redeem the complimentary appetizer coupons and was intent on charging us full boat. Gal Pal quickly explains the situation and asks for Blonde to return to make the correction. That&#39;s when we discover Blonde&#39;s shift was over 20 minutes ago and she&#39;s long gone. 

Gal Pal gets the bill adjusted and wonders aloud if Blonde was going to pass the coupons off as &#39;stocking stuffers&#39; for the holidays. Cash is paid closing the tab and these two local customers will not be returning."

Ambiance is perfect, you can hear the piano/singer from the restaurant but not the conversation at the table next to you.  
Everyone at our table raved about the food and the quality.

I know I don&#39;t need to say much more than that, but I like to hear myself talk so here goes!

After a pretty miserable walk around Orland Mall on the first truly cold and fall like rainy day we decided to pick a restaurant on campus.   At first we were looking at Perry&#39;s Steakhouse and granted you cant really go wrong there.  But I checked YELP and once again, almighty YELP steered my in the right direction.  I searched nearby restaurants and Season 52 was first on the list and reviews were killer.

For those that don&#39;t know, Season 52 is a fresh, organic, non-GMO restaurant with a really cool concept.  The main menu changes with the seasons, four times each year they adapt the menu to what is fresh and seasonal.  52 times a year, weekly, they change the chef&#39;s selections menu.   AWESOME!  So as far as keeping things fresh and interesting that&#39;s handled.

The ambiance is great, dark and Oaky with that high end, almost supper club feel.  I dig that type of ambiance!  

Our sever, Carol I believe, was amazing.  She was polite, knowledgeable and engaging.  She was around when you needed her and absent when you didn&#39;t, that is a skill that takes a long time to master, especially in a packed restaurant.

Also, the wine list is killer.  They have a Master sommelier (spelling?) need I say more?

So, we just happened to find Season 52 right after they implemented their fall menu.  So, the scene is set, the first cold/rainy day and a top of the line fall menu..... perfect!

We ordered the Edemame (my kid 18 mos old loves soy beans!) and we ordered soups.  I ordered the Butternut Squash Clove Soup with Shitake mushrooms.  B+  This was the only food that didn&#39;t get perfect marks from me FYI.  It was really good but needed to be thickened a bit and maybe a little brown sugar or something.  Oh and the shitake was a weird accompaniment flavor wise. 

For dinner I ordered from the Chef&#39;s weekly selections and went with the Roasted quail stuffed with mushroom risotto.  A++++++    Perfectly cooked (3) quail with a very savory sauce filled with mushroomy wonderfulness!!   Highly recommended!

My mother in law ordered the Rainbow Trout.  A+++++   De-boned and served skin down with a side of dill/lemon/mayo.   It was the table favorite.  Perfect in every way and I now have a challenge to recreate this entree at home!   

My wife ordered the rack of lamb.  A+  This was presented bones up and was really and attractive plating.  The meat was cooked to perfection and I was able to destroy the leftovers Saturday for lunch!  Yay me!

Desert is a really cool concept as well.  They bring a rack of 8 or so really large 2 - 3 Oz I think filled with different small desert portions.  You just take the ones you want.  We took the Key Lime Pie, Peanut Butter Nut something and the warm apple crisp (winner!!).   They were all good, and the whole desert concepts was great for sharing many different flavors!

If you&#39;re in Orland this is a top of the line option among many good options in the area.   If you haven&#39;t been here give it a try, you will enjoy!

Oh yeah, free Valet as well!"

Our server was Joey. He started by asking us if we have ever been there &amp; both me and my husband were seasons 52 virgins. He gave us great recommendations which suited our tastes and also was a great help with my wine selections. I&#39;m a steak lover and let me tell you this filet mignon was top 3. Oh my gosh and dont get me started on the desserts. He brought over desserts and because we were newbies he made them complimentary. We went Valentine&#39;s Day weekend and that was the only day that we were able to go out and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Thanks Joey for awesome experience. And thanks Seasons 52 for the wonderful food and wine.  BTW the Flatbreads are to die for!!!!

I&#39;ve been here two or three times now, and every trip has been positively delightful.  Most recently, I sat in one of the private rooms in the back which are reserved for large parties.  As part of our engineering secretary&#39;s going-away dinner, we (i.e. my boss) spared no expense.  Appetizers up the wazoo, drinks, entrees, dessert, the works.  My only regret is that I didn&#39;t take any photos (but I didn&#39;t want to be &#39;that guy&#39; Instagramming the entire meal).

The chef also kindly provided our group of 15 with a tuna tartare amuse-bouche.  I was fortunate enough to sample the following hors d&#39;oeuvres that were passed around:

+ goat cheese ravioli + lobster flatbread + tuna tartare + mushroom caps stuffed with shrimp and breadcrumbs

To start, I got the lumb crab wedge salad which had plenty of real crabmeat.  For my main course I ordered the honey &amp; herb chicken, which came with yukon gold mashed and roasted green beans.  Priced somewhere around $18, it was the least-expensive entree on the menu.  Coworkers ordered vension, lamb chops, sea scallops, and they all proclaimed them very good.

The desserts sealed the deal, no bones about it: s&#39;mores, amaretto, lemon-blueberry ricotta, tiramisu, triple chocolate fudge, and a heavenly key lime pie, just to name a few.  Perfectly adorable &#34;dolcinis&#34; came to us in three sets of ten--for those of you counting at home, this amounted to 30 mini desserts for 15 people, a more than adequate number.  Because I&#39;m a P-I-G, I ate 4.
........And took one home 0:-)  The sticky fingers bandit strikes again, mwahaha!

Our servers were average, deserving of the 18% automatic gratuity I suppose, but not as good as I would&#39;ve hoped for a restaurant of this caliber.  At the end of our meal, we wanted to take a group photo, and our server(s) were nowhere to be found!  Someone from our party had to track them down, which was troubling.  The ambiance was decidedly intimate, with low-level lighting throughout.  In fact, it was almost too dim to see clearly, as several in my party indicated (but it didn&#39;t bother me).  I also want to note that a few of the very heavy tables were slanted downwards, so much so that a wine glass would slide on it!  This should probably be addressed.

A splendid date night spot, if a tad pricey.  Would happily return!"

What I ordered: Duck Wing lollipops with a red chili glaze and sesame seeds. Kona crusted lollipop lamb chops.

Comments: 5/10 for the duck. 6/10 for the lamb. 
Presentation was cute but not practical. The chili sauce under the duck wings dried on the plate. The duck was cooked unevenly inside but had a good and crispy coating. The lamb chops were cooked evenly (unfortunately more medium well then medium) but the Kona crust was . Service was a bit long. Ambiance was dark and private, great for a girls night out :) also the carrot cake was to die for!!!!!! Service and dessert is why I gave 4/5 stars vs 3/5 for the food"

I&#39;ll start by prefacing my review and stating that the only reason I did not give 5 stars was because although we made a reservation, we still had to wait for 20 minutes.  Otherwise, I would definitely give 5 stars. However, a busy Saturday night is somewhat understandable.

Our server was Joey and he was wonderful, very knowledgeable and kind!  He was very accommodating with any needs we had, and knew about everything pertaining to the menu.

My husband ordered the flights and flatbread, all of which was excellent!  We shared his roasted Roma tomato flatbread and it was scrumptious! The mushroom bisque was not as flavorful as desired, but Joey was quick to take care of that issue.  I had my usual, the vegetarian tasting.  This meal never disappoints and was so tasty!  It contained roasted beets(yummy!), a stuffed mushroom(so good!), broccolini, a black bean and feta taco(tasty), cedar plank tofu(the best!), and quinoa salad.  My husband had the short ribs and he loved it!  There was no room for desert, but past experiences prove they are divine.  Highly recommend Seasons!"

Kristen is the absolute best bartender, we have her make our drinks. She&#39;s so great and we go there enough that she knows us by name and knows what drinks we order. The food is delicious, I&#39;ve never had a bad experience. They change their menu seasonally so they have new and fresh options all the time. 

The best part of my night is ending the meal with one or two of their phenomenal mini indulgence desserts. My only complaint is they got rid of my favorite, the amaretto mini. Hopefully, it will make an appearance in one of their future menus."

Needless to say, I was impressed. I LOVED that they would cater their menu to the season and that way you knew each item on the menu was fresh. This place has the quality of a farmers market mixed with the comfort of fine dining. However, because they only have items that are in menu, Winter time can present some limitations on what they serve (Fish, Mushrooms, Soups). They don&#39;t serve everything all the time i guess.

Recommend at the very least trying it out for a meal to see what it&#39;s about. First time I tried a place like this"

But then recently, I heard from two separate accounts about how great the food is. And then when I talked to other folks, they too raved about it.  

We came here on a weekend night, early. It was still busy. We ordered the lamb chops, a flat iron steak salad, a seared ahi tuna salad and something off the kids menu. The schtick is that everything is under 450 calories. The lamb was delicious and served on bed of mashed potatoes. The salads were delivered to the table in a cylinder that was then dramatically released onto a plate. The salads were good. Not heavy on the dressing. Enough. But there really was many blue cheese crumbles in my salad. I guess that&#39;s how they keep the calorie count down. My husband didn&#39;t seem satisfied but understood that this is how we should be eating. 

Next came the dish of desserts. I was under the impression that each shot glass was 80 calories. But it was actually 350.  I was upset as I was planning on getting a few! We ordered an assortment and shared 5 among the 4 of us. It was plenty. 

Overall, the place was good and the food was good too. I would like to come here more often. But it is kind of pricey."

I did not order any specialty pizzas because I wanted to taste their basic pies first. There was a BOGO offer! When they arrived it looked eerily similar to a papa johns pizza.

We have been disappointed again and again by incredibly over-priced, tiny little pies that belong at a gas station. This place was no different, and possibly one of the worst. The pictures online and the toppings sounded excellent, and the type of crust looked like what we were hoping for. We ordered the Greek Pizza and some BBQ Wings. The pizza was tiny, and it looked like a &#34;supreme&#34; style frozen pizza. The crust was the right style, but had a gummy under-cooked quality, and nothing about it tasted &#34;greek&#34;. It tasted exactly like the frozen &#34;rising crust&#34; pizzas my mom would leave us to make ourselves when she was at work during high school summer breaks. And the wings....they had basically no flavor at all, and no sauciness to them. And they were very small, with mostly just fat on them. I thought the nice addition of a little side of sauce, peppercinis and parmesan packets was cool, until I realized it did nothing at all to improve a pizza that was basically a thievery of $18. Definitely go elsewhere if you want your money&#39;s worth. If you want bland, quick pizza, go to 7-Eleven instead."

There is both indoor and outdoor seating and the employees are very pleasant. 
I got an iced Earl Grey Tea and it was freshly brewed (time consuming but 100% worth the wait- was amazing!) also I got a somoa donut. The donut was dense and tasted amazing. The coconut was a perfect pair with the chocolate and the cake donut. It is truly a struggle to stop my self from getting multiple donuts there while I study there."

It&#39;s small and has limited options as far as coffee goes. They also have hot chocolate, smoothies and some fresh food. If you are stuck inside the library and need refueling, this is a great option.

I visited around 4pm on a Tuesday. There were lots of Moms with their kids ordering hot chocolates and it took awhile to get my coffee. All of us were headed out somewhere else and were very impatient. There were 2 people working there, but only one was making drinks. I couldn&#39;t figure that out.

Everything was nice and clean and the employees were very friendly. I like supporting a local business, but I won&#39;t be back unless I have time to spare."

The order went through and I got an email a few seconds later confirming my order and saying the pizzas would be ready in 20 minutes. I live about 15-20 minutes away from this location, so I got in the car and drove over to make sure I showed up in time.

Upon arrival, I called into the restaurant as I was instructed to do from my confirmation email. I told the employee who answered the phone that I was waiting in one of the Curbside Pick-Up parking spots outside. She said someone would be out promptly.

Twenty minutes later, no food, so I call back in and the same employee answered the phone and said someone &#34;would be out promptly.&#34; Another employee came out a few seconds later and confirmed my order. I asked her what took so long and she said the employee who answered the phone &#34;got busy and forgot.&#34; Nice excuse. Pretty sure I can&#39;t use that at my job.

She went to get the pizzas, came back out to my car and her exact words were,&#34;Well......that doesn&#39;t look like how they USUALLY make it!&#34; and this was in reference to the spicy chipotle chicken pizza I had ordered. At this point, I&#39;m annoyed that I&#39;ve waited 20 minutes, and one of my pizzas isn&#39;t &#34;how they usually make it.&#34; So, I asked the employee if I can just have my money back. She avoided the question and said she was going to run inside and get the sauce for my pizza. Umm..excuse me? The pizza doesn&#39;t even have the right SAUCE on it? Okay... 

She comes back out with the sauce and I go home. With the chicken pizza, I specifically ordered it to come without poblano peppers. With the first bite, I noticed they were on there....

For $30+ for two pizzas, I could have definitely had a better meal somewhere else with far better service and less hassle. Never again."

Service was ok, food was ok, however we were first charged one amount on a credit card, then the server came back and charged another amount on the same credit card.  When we asked for a credit, we first talked to an assistant manager, who said he needed to talk to someone else.  After waiting about 20 minutes, the general manager came out and said they could not give us a credit for the incorrect amount charged, but did an adjustment.  This all appeared very fraudulent to me.  If you choose to eat at this establishment, make sure they are not running your credit card for multiple bills.  Very shady in my opinion and I will not be revisiting this location again. The manager&#39;s comment was &#34;well mistakes do happen.&#34;  I don&#39;t believe it was a mistake!"

My husband I were starving and he felt like CPK, a place I would frequent in junior high when cruising Oakbrook mall with my besties. The one out here on Diehl is well positioned across the street from the world&#39;s BEST Target, and in front of an enormous movie theater. The interior is bright and nice and the service is fine, but last night, we wanted takeout. CPK has online ordering (YES!) and curbside pickup (HELL YES!) and we scanned the menu with glee to pick out our choices. I noticed that a LOT of the menu items had truffle oil on them(I&#39;m severely allergic to truffles), but the pizza we chose did not, so I didn&#39;t think twice about it and moved on. 

We picked up our food and a delightful young lady brought it out to us promptly. Upon arriving home, we saw we were missing our appetizer. Annoying, but they credited our bill and still let my husband go pick it up, so forgivable. I had a slice of pizza and it was delicious. Then I went for a second slice and smelled... Truffle oil. Oh god, I thought. Is it on every slice? It&#39;s not supposed to be on this pizza at all! I put the slice back down and waited. Terrified. An hour later, fears confirmed: I was sicker than sick. I&#39;m fine now, but yikes. Don&#39;t sneak weird ingredients that can make people barf on to pizza, please.

In conclusion, I won&#39;t be going back to CPK, but you probably should. Unless you&#39;re allergic to items that shouldn&#39;t be on the pizza. Ugh."

Then we were seated immediately and ordered the soup. Soup was hot and tasted good. Both the wife and mum loved it. Since they are the veggie eaters at the table they got a thin crust veggie pizza and I ordered the fish taco. My wife liked the pizza, but mom was not so impressed. Fish taco was not the best but not the worst. They cud have atleast served 3 tacos instead of 2 tacos and ships adn salsa. On the whole it was an ok experience given so many issues before dinner."

I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s a super family friendly place, but we didn&#39;t feel out of place by any measure. I ordered the four cheese ravioli. My eldest daughter ordered Macaroni and Cheese from the child&#39;s menu. My other daughter decided she wasn&#39;t very hungry so we would share my adult portion of raviolis. My husband ordered the Jambalaya pasta. 

The server was very friendly, however he wasn&#39;t very comfortable with the kids. He asked them very awkward questions. No points taken off though because some people just don&#39;t have a way with kids. I get that. The food came fast. My husband and eldest daughter both enjoyed their meals. They said the taste and portion sizes were perfect! Mine however, was a tiny portion. There were maybe 8 raviolis total. More sauce than anything else. My daughter had a bigger portion of macaroni and cheese from the children&#39;s menu. I had her split it my younger daughter because there was no way I was going to be able to fill hers and my belly on my dish. It wasn&#39;t very tasty either.

The food: We had a white pizza and a California veggie on honey wheat crust. They were both scrumptious but I enjoyed the veggie a bit more since it had more ingredients (like mushrooms, roasted eggplant, baby asparagus, and red onions) and packed more flavor into each bite than the white.

The beverage: I tried something new to drink: mango iced tea. They take normal ice tea and add in sweetened flavored syrups.  They had several varieties (peach, raspberry, and another one too), but I am so happy I tried the mango.  
** Sidenote: It tastes a lot like CBTL&#39;s Mucho Mango (my favorite beverage on the planet), so you can imagine how happy I was since I normally have to travel 2,000 miles to get one of those. **

The service: Bonnie was wonderful - very helpful in making our pizza selection and attentive throughout the entire meal.  Perfect in every way!

Didn&#39;t miss them and never turned back. After today, though, I&#39;m happy to have tried them again. There were 5 of us, and we were splitting a whole slew of things. The dumpling appetizers were good, as were the egg rolls with lots of avocado and bacon, which were even better. The harvest salad was surprisingly ultra fresh and delish, with lots of candied pecans, fruit, field greens, cranberries gorgonzola cheese. The best pizza and the one I would order again is the extra thin artichoke, spinach and chicken pizza. With a generous helping of these 3 ingredients and both mozzarella cheese and parmesan cheese, that was an awesome pizza. While a pasta dish was good and the meat-lovers pizza was hearty and tasty, this was the best entrée/pizza. Service was fantastic, our waiter kept up with all the drink and water refills as much as the alcoholic drinks. Couldn&#39;t really ask for more!"

Who knew artichoke, mushroom and pineapple pizza was made all the better by scooping on guacamole?

My visit this afternoon was rather lovely, greeted by a fun, cute and super caring hostess who chatted with me and recommended some awesome seasonal specials. The waiter was a bit scattered, but it was during lunch rush, so that&#39;s to be expected. My cheese pizza was a bit too greasy for my tastes, even after dabbing it with a napkin, but the crust had a savory hint of butter and the flavors were balanced delicately. A thin-crust pizza has to work damn hard to earn a recommendation from a die-hard deep dish fan like me, but it won me over in the end.

One bit of advice? Don&#39;t you dare walk out that door without dessert. The super-sized portions are worth every penny (and calorie). I had my first taste of cheesecake ever, which tasted like it was made with real pumpkin, and my friend scooped up every last morsel of the red velvet cake. He said it was the best he&#39;d ever had. My envious eyes (and stomach) are eagerly waiting their turn on another trip.

Also of note: this is the perfect place to bring folks with food allergies. The menu notes gluten-free options, and the online menu is super helpful for vegetarians. I&#39;ve never before seen a restaurant specify by lacto-ovo, vegan, and every permutation in between!"

The bread slices have shrunk, they don&#39;t bring out any Parmesan cheese or butter to go with anymore (just a dish of olive oil), and the BBQ chicken salad appeared to be completely lacking any jicama. We tried the lettuce wraps but they weren&#39;t nearly as good as the ones at Pei Wei. Oh, and when two people are dining would it have killed them to provide four pieces of lettuce instead of only three? Overpriced and underwhelming is my new view of this restaurant.

The few times I&#39;ve been to this location the hostesses are friendly and efficient, the servers are fun and have never messed up an order.

Only real complaint is that refills often take longer than one would like. I understand when they are busy. I don&#39;t always want a refill right away and will turn it down, but it doesn&#39;t hurt to ask again later if we&#39;ve been sitting a while."

It&#39;s just that so rarely I find a good salad, made with fresh greens, veggies &amp; cheeses, chopped and tossed the right way. CPK does this right, and for that, I am willing to pay $10-13 for a good salad.

They have so many varieties. I love their Waldorf, Thai crunch, BBQ chopped &amp; regular chopped salads. They offer them in 1/2 or full portions, and the 1/2 is perfect as a regular meal or to split with a couple friends before your meal. 

Their pizza is also good, but I&#39;m a Chicago deep-dish or authentic Italian pizza fan, so I rarely get pizza here. Some of my friends and I have been coming here since high school, and they always get the same pizzas. There is a BLT pizza! 

One thing I must say, though, is that sometimes the service is a little cray cray. This one time, my girlfriend and I had this obnoxious waiter that made us very uncomfortable. He stayed too long, awkwardly chatting it up, rarely leaving us time to chat with one another. Then when we needed to pay our bill and get our food wrapped, he was nowhere to be found. The next time I visited CPK, I had a darling waitress who was delightful and very professional. I think it&#39;s just hit or miss!"

Pros:
- I called literally 5 minutes before bringing a huge group of 10 over. Girl on the phone was receptive and pleasant! We were greeted with a smile and had a table ready and waiting! And we&#39;re talking 7:30pm on a Saturday!
- Server was charismatic, knew his stuff, and had a great attitude. So mad I didn&#39;t take down his name -- he was a tall gentleman with blonde hair put in a ponytail. You, sir, are amazing.
- Service was attentive, food was super fast, and restaurant was clean with a great atmosphere/ambiance.
- The food was holy crap delicious. I had the peach salad with salmon, and a white wine margarita. Probably the best margarita of my life.

Cons:
- NONE
- LITERALLY, NONE

I&#39;d also like to mention this was not only my birthday celebration, but my FIRST visit to a California Pizza Kitchen and it was an outstanding one at that. Thanks for making my birthday extra amazing!"

Understanding that California does not have good pizza, CPK has better pizza than what you&#39;d get in the actual state. But they could still use more sauce. A lot more sauce. If you&#39;re eating BBQ Chicken Pizza, you should be able to at least taste the BBQ sauce.

All pizzas are 6-slice 10&#34; thick crust. You can have thin crust for an extra $1.50, which makes no sense that you pay more for less dough.

The low price appetizers do kinda make up for the ridiculous price increase for thin crust pizza. Got 4 fried mac and cheese bites for $3.75. They were overcooked, but I like that. Would just be better with a tastier cheese, but for $3.75, can&#39;t really complain. Better cheese would probably increase the price.

The location is gorgeous. I like that there&#39;s a regular door for handicapped patrons instead of the revolving door (would be too dangerous to use a revolving door whether on crutches or in a wheelchair). But the seperate door is very heavy. It would be great if they had buttons for automatic opening so a handicapped customer wouldn&#39;t have to depend on an able-bodied person to open the door for them.

If I liked the food better, I&#39;d use their Take Out frequently."

It took our waiter a long time to come over and greet us and take our drink order. When he brought our drinks he asked if we would like some bread and oil - Yes Please! It never came. Our pizzas were good, but very messy to eat. My husband and I were both looking forward to trying their special new dessert which was advertised on a stand on the table. When we ordered it our waiter said they were all out. Seriously? Did anyone consider taking the picture of it off the tables?

I&#39;ve been eating at CPK since it first opened at Oakbrook. Back then they still had roasted garlic shrimp pizza, which to my little kid taste buds was the best thing ever. 

Fast forward to my adult years and I still come here for the pizza but I also like their appetizers, salads and entrees. 

I always have to have the spinach artichoke dip. It&#39;s cheesy, creamy and savory. Probably frozen, heated up and chock full of bad things but you only live once, right? I also tried the fried mac and cheese bites. Pretty good. Can you tell I really like cheese? =)

If I&#39;m in a salad mood, I like to order the Waldorf salad with chicken or the Cobb. I love the abundance of ingredients in each salad and the option of ordering either a full or half.

For pizzas, I like to order the roasted garlic chicken, wild mushroom or bbq chicken. Yum.

When I want to carbo load, I&#39;ll order spaghetti bolognese, chicken piccata, or broccoli and sun-dried tomato fusilli. 

It&#39;s decent food at decent prices."

Their standard crusts are delicious, and with the right pizza the wheat crust is really tasty.

The value is very poor... my son ordered the pepperoni pizza... this pizza was no different than Little Caesars for over DOUBLE the price.  My  husband had the Sicilian Lovers, and both of these had hardly any cheese at all!!  Yet, both were priced between $13-$16!!

We enjoyed the fresh avocado, corn and bean salsa appetizer... yet when we asked for a few more tortilla chips to finish up the dip, they charged us more.

It would have been nice to have more description on the menu for the salad I ordered (BBQ chicken)... the menu just stated BBQ sauce, ranch and cilantro... there were several other things on the actual salad, including cheese, and tortilla strips, both of which I would have eliminated when ordering, to keep it healthier.

I especially like the avocado egg rolls, tequila-lime fettuccine, and the Santa Fe chicken pizza.  ...all good choices.

CPK used to have one of my favorite martinis...the California Cosmo.  It was a cosmo-style drink, but with grape flavors, instead of cranberry.  It was garnished with frozen grapes.  It was clean, crisp, strong, and I just loved it.  They took it off their menu.  *sad face*  I want that drink back!  They do make a good apple martini though...one of the better ones I&#39;ve ever had.

We started our meal with the LETTUCE WRAPS - what a great little appetizer. Four lettuce leaf/shell&#39;s, and a diced chicken filling.Perfect for the four person party we were dining with.

I always get pizza. BBQ chicken never fails. A great tasting non-traditional pizza. The crust and dough is really soft, which goes well with non-traditional pizza flavor.

My girlfriend got the Broccoli Rabe, Sun-dried Tomato fusilli. She loves this dish for the simplicity and taste.

Our friends go Jambalaya (blackened shrimp and grilled chicken tossed with noodles!), and the Thai Crunch Salad (it looks so tasty with all of the crispy wonton strips).

We didn&#39;t get dessert this time - but last time we got a slice of the Red-Velvet cake and it was really fabulous. Sounds crazy, that CPK would have such good red-velvet cake, but it was perfect.

The one drawback about this trip was the number of children eating at 9pm on a Saturday night. This speaks more about the clientele than the restaurant, but just to let yo know who you could be eating with.

Who goes to CPK?
Folks looking for a solid meal. There is almost something for everyone (the only things missing are like steaks and chops). Prices are reasonable and the waits usually aren&#39;t that bad.

Who doesn&#39;t go to CPK?
People who want a more intimate dining experience (i.e. no kids shouting at 9pm) People who want high-class dining. CPK is fancy pizza, not fancy food"

Tonight I had the penna with sausage, peppers and marinara sauce and I have to say the spices were pretty well done.  What I really enjoy about it is the kid-friendly atmosphere that includes better-prepared kid meals.  They do not have ketchup bottles on the table (or in the kitchen).  The chicken is grilled, not of the chicken finger variety.  I might get the kid&#39;s mac &amp; cheese for myself next time.

The food is always ok to good at CPK, so no big surprises need be expected. Servers seem automated androids sometimes, but that&#39;s just ranked up to job satisfaction and not your fault.

CPK recently added a couple of new items such as a mediterranean salad with hummus  and feta (protein) and a lovely variety of greens, served with a side of pita -- reminiscent of their cannellini hummus appetizer but in a salad form.

The wild mushroom pizza has a lovely garlic and wild mushroom taste that&#39;s hard to find elsewhere.

My husband had the garlic cream fettucine with shrimp and chicken and I ordered the kung pao spaghetti with shrimp. Both of us were very pleased with our choices. The pasta was cooked al dente as it should be and the sauces were flavorful. I asked for mine extra spicy and was given a dish of hot sauce to spice it up to the level I like.

I ordered the &#34;new&#34; Cajun Pizza which has blackened chicken, andouille sausage with a creole sauce, roasted peppers, mild onions with Mozzarella.  It wasn&#39;t bad at all.  The meats were tasty and it arrived quickly so for lunch this was a pretty good deal.

thank GOD though that I didn&#39;t have to pay for this.  The pizza&#39;s run about $10-11 here and that&#39;s more than I&#39;d spend on lunch for myself usually (once you add in a soda or extras).

The restaurant is pretty cool and they offer curbside service if you want to order take out.  We didn&#39;t have any appetizers or desserts, so the pizza was all I had.  I&#39;d probably come back here again, since it&#39;s close to the office.  Although I&#39;ve never met a pizza I don&#39;t like, the nice thing is that they have so many different kinds of them.

They were very accommodating for a vegetarian friend along with us as well as any &#34;special order&#34; where someone wanted a pizza but not a specific item that comes standard on it."

here&#39;s my advice, don&#39;t eat anywhere near the cantera movieplex, a captured audience does not breed good food.  i also got sicker than a dog last time i ate there, pretty sure it was the grilled chicken caesar salad.  uuggh, i still shudder when i think about that place."

And I could not cut the bread with the flimsy plastic knife and fork I was give.  

My wife had the Parma sandwich and said that it was yummy.  (Hence the three stars.)  We both got a bag of chips and a soda.  Bill was $22.

(Incidentally, I believe the owner of the previous place is starting a new gluten-theme restaurant...)

Made in Italy Express is the perfect addition to downtown Glen Ellyn&#39;s food scene. As authentic an Italian café as you&#39;ll find in these parts, the regular salad and sandwich menu is accompanied by soups made in-house and a variety of daily specials. I had the muffaletta sandwich off the specials board one day. Most muffaletta I&#39;ve had are scarce on the meat and heavy on the olive spread. Not at Made in Italy Express. It was solid, and I could taste the flavors of the different meats: mortadella, salami, ham...whatever else they threw in there.

And that&#39;s how they roll! The sandwiches are generous and balanced with the right fresh herbs, cheeses and oils. I have yet to be disappointed. When asked if you want the sandwich pressed, your response should be one of the following:
1. Yes please.
2. Absolutely. 
3. Does a bear crap in the woods?

Get it done.

Finally, the lady who has worked the counter every time I&#39;ve been there recognized me the other day and threw in a couple of treats for my girls...on the house. Nice touch! Go to Made in Italy Express...often!"

That never happens! I didn&#39;t think anybody ever won those cereal box giveaways, but I did! When we received it in the mail - I still didn&#39;t believe it until it was in my hand - I yelled that we were going out for steak! Morton&#39;s was on our list of places to try and it was my birthday! W00t!

Our server was on it! He was funny with sort of a dry, witty humor that had us all cracking up! He also had some great suggestions as we were asking him questions about the menu. We opted to get the Porterhouse Steak so we could share it. I got the filet and the boy got the strip. This is by far the best steak either of us has had to date! The sear and crust on the outside was mouth-watering! I&#39;m drooling just typing this! We each only ate half our steaks which was great for lunch the next day!

We ordered two sides... They brought back the Bacon &amp; Onion Macaroni &amp; Cheese and we&#39;re glad we got to try it! This is how you make REAL mac &#39;n cheese! They did a nice, smooth béchamel sauce and just the right amount of cheese. This makes it perfect for leftovers as we were only able to eat a quarter of the side each! 

We also ordered a side of the Lyonnaise Potatoes which are sliced with onions and bacon and fried in bacon... More bacon please... Yes! Again, they out did themselves. The potatoes were nice and crispy and there wasn&#39;t a pool of greasy like it might sound. The onions added a nice sweetness to the dish. We still each only ate a quarter of this one so we took it home for lunch the next day too!

Then there&#39;s dessert... Why didn&#39;t we eat everything on our plates?! Well, it was filling AND there is dessert! We ordered the Morton&#39;s Cheesecake and the Bread Pudding, why 2?! Why not?! The bread pudding was really good, don&#39;t get me wrong. It could use a real rum sauce though. The cheesecake though... OMG! I have never had one that was so creamy and amazing!"

I&#39;m a huge foodie but rarely pay $40-60 for an entree and was skeptical about whether this spot would be worth it. Boy oh boy though, Morton&#39;s was worth it! 

There was a group of seven of us at dinner and I can&#39;t speak to how everything tasted but I do know there were a LOT of satisfied customers. I personally tried the Cajun Ribeye, Chicago Style Horseradish Mashed Potatoes, Roasted Brussels Sprouts, Sour Cream Mashed Potatoes, Truffled Cauliflower Mash, and the Scallops Special (scallops in a foie gras sauce with truffled leeks) which was my main course. 

The highlights for me were the ccallops and cauliflower, I truly have never had such amazing scallops and the truffled leeks were the perfect complement. All the mashed potatoes were great but the mashed cauliflower was on another level for me. 

I honestly have to say, if you&#39;re looking for a splurge meal Morton&#39;s is a great place to do it. Even if you are not a huge steak fan they have outstanding seafood options and the sides are worth a trip on their own."

About the food, the steaks are good, but they made the vegetables way to salty even taste bitter.

The day arrives and upon being greeted, we had a quick 2 minute wait due to the place being so crowded. Despite having reservations, this didn&#39;t bother me, we were promptly seated and the waiter (I forgot his name, sadly), offered to take our jackets which we declined, and gave us a quick but informative rundown of the menu.

The whole meal, steaks, veggies, dessert (lava cake and key lime pie) were on point. Not to mention in my opinion the price was not bad ($200.00 or so). We got complimentary photos that were printed out for us by Roseanne before we left. I would have to say this experience was a very good one.

The only reason why it&#39;s 4 out of 5 stars was at times, it seems as if our waiter overlooked us when we were just sitting there for our next dish or mainly.. when we wanted our check. I would definitely dine again at this location without question."

We strike a combination of something fried and something green. The Sautéed Brussels Sprouts are my current favorite. Same with the Lyonnaise Potatoes. If I&#39;m throwing all caution to the wind or wanting to eat my stress away for one night, that&#39;s the winning combination. The Brussels Sprouts pack a lot of flavor and have some nice caramelized edges and you can seriously never go wrong with a crispy starch cooked with onions. --Lyonnaise Potatoes. Any of the following combinations are worthy of a little more treadmill time though:

Grilled Asparagus 
Sautéed Broccoli
Sautéed Brussels Sprouts
Lyonnaise Potatoes
Parmesan &amp; Truffle Fries
Onion Rings

I have never had to send a steak back here. Not once. It&#39;s always cooked exactly as I request. Medium. A little bit bloody with some charred edges. --The mark of a perfect steak.

A nice place to celebrate a birthday, an anniversary, or just the fact that it&#39;s Wednesday. Service is always impeccable. End of story."

Since that day I&#39;ve visited other comparable restaurants in the area and they just don&#39;t measure up.  I just got through writing a long subpar review for Catch 35, and really don&#39;t feel like writing much more, but I will say this:
Decor at Morton&#39;s is beautiful--my husband and I talked about it during dinner. The service was impressive--it was my birthday and they made me feel like a queen. The food was delicious--this is officially my favorite steak house. 
So after the horrible experience at Catch 35, my husband and I decided that we will only eat at Morton&#39;s for special occasions. We will leave the experimenting with new restaurants to days when satisfaction doesn&#39;t matter much."

The service was very good. Everyone was very friendly, which is what earned Morton&#39;s the 2 stars I gave them. The food here is very expensive and not very good. We ordered the mozzarella wrapped in prosciutto to start. It lacked flavor, was drowning in balsamic and it lacked the crispiness the prosciutto should have in that dish. I&#39;ve had it at other places where I could not stop eating it. I took one bite here and that was enough for me. My steak was super dry and chewy and completely lacked flavor. My husband said the scallops he had were okay but nothing amazing. None of the sides we had impressed us either. We tried the chocolate lava cake for dessert, which was probably my most favorite part, but still not worth the $200 bill that accompanied our evening. I was not impressed and will not be returning."

Honestly I was prepared for an &#34;outback&#34; kind of night. That being said, the service was astounding. We even brought our toddler and they accommodated us without a problem. Great atmosphere, and good wine list.

I ordered the house salad, baked potato, onion rings and the bone in ribeye. Wife had the filet. Their portions are very large for the sides so if it&#39;s date night you&#39;ll probably be good with one order. The rib eye was absolutely delicious. Ridiculous flavor! Filet was very good as well. I ordered mine medium and it came out perfect. And the NY Cheesecake was by far the best cheesecake I&#39;ve ever had. Better than the Cheesecake Factory. Although, it left a nice dent in the wallet, it was well worth the fine night out.

They also had the valet bring the car to the door when our bill was ready. Again, outstanding service."

I made a reservation but when I got there I choose to sit in the very noisy bar and eat with my friend due to the TVs and the Hawks game being on. First the bartender wasnt friendly at all. He acted like because I wasnt a regular I wasnt worthy. Then he charged me for a $16.00 glass of wine over the bar menu $7.50 choice. I didnt specifiy, so he took it upon himself. 
Ok, so we sit at a bar table and we ask to see the promo menu - it consisted of 4 entrees and a couple salads and 1 soup. I ordered the onion soup in the smallest cup Ive ever seen. Then I ordered the shrimp alexander with no description of what it was..it was 6 shrimp on a plate with mashed potato in a side dish. I then ordered cheesecake to go.  Big deal.

I was here for my company&#39;s holiday party. Various servers walked around with different tasty treats before dinner. 

The lamb was DIVINE. I was only offered one bite of this yummy goodness and I pretty much grabbed the tray out of the servers hands to eat the rest. I must come back and try the full course lamb. 

For dinner I ordered a butterflied steak. After our server stopped laughing when I ordered my steak medium well, I felt a little discouraged. But it was cooked to perfection and served with a garlic green beans and mashed potatoes. 

I was stuffed and happy until I received the berries for dessert. It was literally frozen mixed berries with a scoop of cool whip. Disappointing. 

I&#39;d give the steak and the lamb appetizer 10 stars if I could. Delish!"

I rarely comment on value in a negative way but I just don&#39;t feel like it&#39;s worth the higher price than other comparable steak-based establishments.   Service was solid, professional, and the atmosphere was that of a Las Vegas steakhouse.

I had the bone-in filet, which is a &#34;seasonal&#34; item for $59.  A 12 oz. cut with caramelized onions and bleu cheese butter, it was cooked exactly to my liking, but was mostly onions with some bleu cheese taste/flavor present.   The ahi tuna tower to start was solid as well with good sauces included on the plate.   My wife enjoyed the hot chocolate cake and the bacon wrapped scallops on her mixed grill were enormous.

So nothing really wrong from the experience, but Morton&#39;s just didn&#39;t meet my expectations and I&#39;ll head to other places before returning."

The wine cellar is prominent and features the selections you would expect and then some....

The appetizer salads were shared and the chopped salad was fresh and crisp, with the dressing accentuating the taste of fresh greens and other delicate ingredients. The steak as always was the NY Strip and was cooked to order perfectly. Sides were the always fresh and crisp broccoli, baked potato and the decadent (but healthy...) brussel sprouts.  Excellent.

Wine list was great, but like many Midwest restaurants was very young. We chose a nice Clos du val which was reasonably priced and accompanied the meal superbly."

Rated 3 only because of ambiance!! Food was delish. I went here back in March with my husband for a much needed date night and had a great time. 

Food- excellent!!! Everything we ate was delicious. I have to admit, but we practically had to be rolled out. The oysters were so tasty, but pricey. But, to be expected- it&#39;s Morton&#39;s. 

I know they had been acquired by Landry&#39;s and was pleased to see their menu expanded- with intent. Not just a bunch of junk, but carefully selected variety. I&#39;m not a meat eater and had plenty of options.  

Ambiance- ok we are early 30&#39;s, but came for good food and because we had a gift card. That&#39;s the ONLY reason why I rate it 3. It&#39;s white table clothes and formal. They are clearly targeting a specific group and I don&#39;t think it was us! But great food and attentive customer service was key here!"

Everything was presented beautifully. We tried the steak tacos as an appetizer. They were perfect. Had we not just ordered steaks I would have ordered two more tacos. The meat inside was so tender and seasoned perfectly. Only two tacos come with the order so if it is more than two people I would not advise it because you will not want to share.  

We also ordered a caesar salad.  We split it in two because it was huge. Nothing too special about the salad. But we didn&#39;t come here for the salad. 

Finally we got our steaks. He ordered the porterhouse which was a 60$ steak. But it was exactly what he wanted. I tired a small piece and it was so juicy and tender. I ordered the six ounce filet with the three shrimp. My steak was also tender and cooked just as I had asked. The shrimp was also so good.

We had a dessert as well because it was his birthday. It was a cake with three scoops of ice cream. It was heavenly. 

I would suggest coming here anytime you are celebrating something big. Our bill was big but it was totally worth it."

In addition, their attention to making special occasions (birthday, anniversaries, etc.) EXTRA special allows them to take a top spot among choices for such affairs.

My birthday dinner last night was superb, as they always are at this location.  The assortment of delectable items ordered allowed some extra taste-testing of selections we haven&#39;t had in the past: bone-in ribeye; macaroni &amp; cheese; bacon-wrapped scallops.  In addition, with it being on a weeknight (with crummy weather), the dining room was not too filled and offered greater intimacy.

The &#34;Chicago Style Prime Bone-In Ribeye&#34; was amazing, full of beefy flavor and very tender, all trademarks of the &#34;fatty&#34; ribeye and this special cut&#39;s existence on the bone.  Even my father&#39;s 6 oz. &#34;Center Cut Filet Mignon,&#34; as part of the #1 mixed grill (6 oz. filet, 3 grilled shrimp and 2 bacon-wrapped scallops) was described as one of the best filets ever had.  The shrimp were quite good but the scallops left something to be desired, the only sour point on the menu that night.  The &#34;Caesar Salad&#34; was quite good with a solid dressing - a bit spicy, nice anchovies notes and a good helping of garlic - along with fresh and crisp lettuce.

Among the highlights of the evening, however, was the amazing &#34;Bacon &amp; Onion Macaroni &amp; Cheese.&#34;  Wonderfully crisp and tasty bits of bacon were mixed into the Spiralen pasta, all coated with creamy cheese - not too gooey nor metallic, as can become the case - and baked with bread crumbs on top.  That might have easily been the star of the evening&#39;s eatings.

Morton&#39;s provided a complimentary desert for my birthday, and the table shared the upside-down apple pie with a scoop of Häagen-Dazs vanilla ice cream.  Tons of cinnamon almost overwhelmed the table as it was set on the table.  Unfortunately, the apples were left a little too crisp for a baked desert, even though the overall taste was pleasant.  The crust, however, was flaky and buttery, though there wasn&#39;t too much included.

As always, Morton&#39;s knows how to serve and serve well, and their main specialty - Steak! - continues to shine, most especially when accompanied by wonderful side dishes."

The &#34;chutney&#34; sweet sauce for the crab-cakes were a wonderful compliment to the crab-cakes. 
We moved onto the BIB lettuce salad with walnuts and blue cheese. Topped with a not too sweet vinaigrette.
For our main course, we had 22 oz. PRIME BONE IN RIB-EYES, cooked medium rare. Excellent. OMG. EACH bite of our steaks were savory AND explosively wonderful. Cooked perfectly through and through and EACH mouth watering bite was spectacular. For me, this is a true barometer on the flavor of what you&#39;re eating...even as we were finishing up our steak, the last bites were STILL delicious, as the first was. 
Lyonnaise potatoes and Brussels sprouts as our sides. There was an onion/bacony type of mix mixed into the side dishes.
We topped everything off with their signature after dinner coffee that had Bailey&#39;s and served in a wine goblet rimmed with cinnamon. Oh, we also had their Creme Brulee that was done perfectly. The texture was smooth and creamy. The sugary coating on top wasn&#39;t too thick either as I&#39;ve had at other places.
Steve, our waiter was second to none when it came to the service he provided. Never too intrusive, but always making sure everything was perfect. You can actually tell he enjoys serving people just as if we were guest at his home.
This is what dining out should be like.  A memorable dining experience. Anytime you&#39;re wanting meat or beef, save your money until you have enough to go out to Morton&#39;s. The PRIME steaks are perfect.

What happened to Motons??

Let me tell you.....they are now owned by a huge corporate chain and their price point makes them a high end steak house 

Wine per glass....$15-19 a glass....mind you we ate in a strip mall with fast food places

They called to ask if it was a special occasion and I hate all that hoopla I actually had to say twice...no it&#39;s just a date night...sheesh! 

Let&#39;s talk food....that&#39;s why your there 

Complimentary huge onion bread little butter....had to ask for more butter

Crab cake...fabulous but they put the sauce on a leaf and then to get the leaf off the sauce you have to use your hands

Bone in ribeye....great not fabulous not thick....

Filet-ordered medium well...came well done so well done it was burnt really?? Morton&#39;s puts out a burnt steak? Seriously? 

Onion rings...very good but not $12 worth 

Cheesecake very good

Cappuccino very good

We live in restaurant heaven between oakbrook, Naperville, Lombard so many fabulous restaurants to choose from....Morton&#39;s has the reputation to be the best....it was disappointing 

When we walked in I had a weird feeling and I was spot on....pretty place, service was good the food blew it....to bite into a steak that crunches because it is so charred is something you would experience from A chain not Morton&#39;s who I would think has a chef maybe they don&#39;t"

Bitter cold outside, very few patrons, and we were seated immediately. Haven&#39;t been to a Morton&#39;s in several years, and was really looking forward to an excellent dinner. 

Ordered the filet with bearnaise and a side of grilled asparagus. Our server took our order and unfortunately forgot to get it to the kitchen. After about 20 minutes he walked by and noticed we didn&#39;t have our food and immediatley realized he had forgotten our ticket. He came over to the table and profusley apologized for his error and offered us a complimentary dessert. Okay, not the end of the world, people make mistakes.

Our food came about 15 minutes later. The steak was cooked properly, but way too much more gristle than I would expect at any steak house much less Mortons. After I butchered the steak up to remove the gristle, I ended up with about 2/3 of what I started with that was edible. My asparagus was was also marginal...Not hot and the balsamic reduction was runny. 

Needless to say, I was really disappointed with my experience. Don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be heading back there anytime soon...I have better things to spend $60 on mediocre food."

The bar area- while not large- is attractive, although the seating is not &#34;senior friendly&#34;, and would probably be difficult for anyone physically challenged, as well.  

The dining room is also very nicely decorated, and there is ample spacing between the tables.  (The restroom was probably the most disappointing in regard to visual appeal; I expected something a bit more elaborate, but it was nothing special, and just one step above a bathroom in a bus station, in my opinion.  I have been in nicer, more attractive restrooms in retail department stores!).  

The staff on that evening was very attentive and pleasant, in general (although our waitress was a little dry and bland, and didn&#39;t smile much); the hostess even took our picture, and gave us two copies of the picture, which was also a nice take-home keepsake &#34;party favor&#34; (offered at no additional charge by the restaurant).  

The food portions were adequate, although pricey (most of the menu is a la carte), but my pork chop was definitely NOT melt-in-your-mouth tender, by any means.  Needless to say, I was very disappointed by that; I expected near-perfection after everything that I have ever heard about Morton&#39;s.  Suffice it to say, I have made much more tender, and moist, pork chops in my crock pot at home, and without the crusty black charring that overwhelmed any flavor that the Morton&#39;s chop should have offered!  

Overall we were mildly impressed, but I was still left with the feeling that this restaurant is trying &#39;too hard&#39; to be something that it is not, in order to &#34;justify&#34; the bloated menu prices.  Therefore, this is definitely a restaurant that we would reserve for special occasions only, since we do not have a budget that would allow this to be our &#34;go-to&#34; place every weekend."

I had the mixed plate scallops shrimp and filet comes on asparagus Large amount but the scallops were not great and anything wrapped in bacon should be! 
Hubby had bone in filet- he wasn&#39;t blown away it was good but not cravable or even memorable
We shared mashed potato and the corn. 
Sides were ok, not as good as Mastros but ok. 
Good service but nothing to be wowed and standout, we did not have a reservation and were able to be seated immediately on a Friday pm."

I&#39;m not usually one to eat at a restaurant where a single meal costs as much as two weeks worth of groceries....

But then, two of my friends (who happen to be husband and wife) received a VERY generous gift card to Morton&#39;s as an anniversary present, and invited me and another mutual friend to join them for dinner.  Joy!

Well, now that I&#39;ve actually eaten their food, I have to admit that the prices truly reflect the kind of food you get!  Amazing!!!  We all sampled each others&#39; foodstuffs gratuitously, and everything I tasted was absolutely top-notch!  Among the foods I consumed in varying amounts were: Filet Mignon, Center-Cut Ribeye, Chicken Christopher, Ahi Tuna Tower, Grilled Jumbo Asparagus, Parmesan &amp; Truffle Matchstick Fries (whoa!), and... I&#39;m probably forgetting something.... Oh yeah - the Creme Brulee! It was all so good....

Folks, if you&#39;re &#34;into&#34; this level of dining, I can&#39;t imagine that you&#39;d be disappointed here.  The staff was great, our hostess was super-friendly and very attentive, and the lighting and noise levels were good.  Try it - you&#39;ll like it!"

Excellent food. Valet parking as well! Parking gets busy in this plaza so that is a nice extra!

Atmosphere, well that is another thing. Seems as though they tried to cram too many tables/seats in and it does not create an intimate environment as you would think, with the dim lights and quiet music. We sat at an outside booth and I am sure glad we did, from observation I could see that servers were bumping into each other around the tables, asking guests to scoot in, so they could get by and they the awkward feeling of someone else being able to lean over and truly almost eat off your plate....yep they tables were close.

  First we had reservations at 7pm on New Years Eve.. We were not seated until 730.. I don&#39;t know what the point in even having the reservations was..

  We had a yelp deal that brought it to 54.50 a person for a salad, appetizer, 7 oz single cut fillet, side dish and dessert. Seems like a really good deal right? I think the salad was the only good part of my meal.

  The 7 oz fillet which is normally 44 dollars on the menu (which is ridiculously over priced for a petite) was way over cooked for everyone and charred too. The meat was tasteless, and came with a terrible sauce on the side.

  The side dishes lacked flavor, and I would love to know how their crab cake could possibly be considered as jumbo. I can guarantee you if I would had ordered that as an appetizer for the 11-14 dollars that it&#39;s listed as I would had stormed out of the restaurant without paying for a thing.

  We had the creme brulee for dessert and it was very average/sub par.

  My friends and I will never be returning to Morton&#39;s steak house, and we will be warning everyone not to waste their money at a place that wouldn&#39;t know flavor or  reasonable pricing if it hit them in the face"

I got the filet which was very juicy and delicious! I don&#39;t care what people say - I am a filet lady. We weren&#39;t feeling hungry enough to order any sides (everything was a la carte) and I sort of wish we had, in order to sample more of their menu. Maybe next time?

Because I would not want the check, but when it is on the corporate expense account &#34; I am saying bring on the Mortons&#34;. This is fine dining at its best, close to Washoe Steak house in Reno  for attention to detail. They have extra servers to assist you in seating, well versed to navigate through the menu, ready to help you with appetizers and pre-dinner selections. We started with jumbo shrimps, shredded crab cocktail and ahi tar tar tid bits - yummy! 
Next was the entrees a selection of fine steaks, from filets, rib eyes , new Yorks and porter houses all at a prime section of beef. I decided on the double cut lamb chops, with a cauliflower and truffle mushroom purée .
I enjoy a good cut of meat and this was not disappoint in the portion was huge and the protein cooked to medium rare perfection. The vegetable looked like a fine mashed potato , but was a finely puréed cauliflower with. Blend of black truffle to mushrooms silky to the taste.
The service continued to be spot on and not lacking , after the entrees the dessert menu was circulated and we had a chocolate torte cake, carrot cake, a mouse creme brûlée and of course coffees with a liqueur twist to top of the evening. The bar had the Giants on and most were cheering the Pirates, and I was the lonely San Fransico fan, I was not disappointed in the meal or the game. Mortons continues to be a destination location and one I would heartily recommend as long as you are not paying the check. I hope to return on an expense account soon. Go Giants!"

The steak was perfectly cooker and had the perfect balance of Cajun spice and natural marble fat.  Food was 5 stars.

Came here to celebrate a birthday and what a disappointment. One positive, is that it was nice when they took our picture and also when they gave us a free dessert. However, the rest of the meal was a letdown. The steaks were good, but not phenomenal. The horseradish mashed potatoes were way too strong and pretty much inedible. Our waiter was very slow, barely checked on us, and never cleared our table so we were swimming in dirty dishes as we tried to eat our meal. Also, the dining room was kind of out of control. One table had a group of teen/tween girls who were loud, yelling, creating havoc while another large group had a table of very loud and very overserved people who were verbally yelling at each other. Not sure where the management or staff were during all this commotion, but they seemed to disappear just as things got  louder. We couldn&#39;t get out of there fast enough. I honestly was afraid that a fist fight might break out and I didn&#39;t want to stick around to see the outcome. It was a really unpleasant experience. I get the feeling that Morton&#39;s is under new management because it was definitely a different experience since my last review. It definitely has slid in the quality of food, service, and atmosphere since our last visit. By the way, this meal was not cheap, we spent close to 300 dollars and I wish now that we had gone to Outback instead. Very disappointed with this dining experience. I hope Mortons can get their act together or we won&#39;t every come back."

Morton&#39;s quality of steaks is truly maddening.  I&#39;ve probably eaten in steakhouses of this quality 50ish to 75ish times.  In places of this price point, 2 of the top 5 steaks I&#39;ve ever had have come from Morton&#39;s .  However, all 5 of the worst I&#39;ve ever had have come from Morton&#39;s. 

I&#39;ve eaten at this Morton&#39;s 3 times.  My experiences at the Naperville location perfectly sum up the Morton&#39;s experience.  I&#39;ve had one truly superb steak, one decent, and one bad.  The problem is when you&#39;re spending $60 on a steak, bad shouldn&#39;t be an option.  Tonight it was.  The bone in ribeye had more gristle than meat.  That shouldn&#39;t be the case in a place with this price point
.  
The service is usually good.  I had a bartender that was somewhat on the surly side, though the second was totally what I expected in a place like this.  Cocktails are on the expensive side, but well made.  Generally though bartenders shouldn&#39;t make you feel like you&#39;re a hassle to deal with when you&#39;re ordering something simple like a Manhattan.  I got that vibe at this location.

The service is generally quite good.  In fact the Naperville location has had consistently excellent service.  Professional, personable and well trained.  They explained the menu VERY well. Additionally the manager reached out to us (multiple times) for a large private party and let us order off the menu and get a private room.  No complaints at all about the professionalism of the staff.  Morton&#39;s properties are usually good, and the Naperville location is not an exception.    Their waitstaff, maitre&#39;d and manager are first class all the way.  

The sides are VERY solidly done.  In fact the lobster bisque was very solidly done.  Perfectly seasoned and good.   It was a bit less creamy than I&#39;d hope for, but I would order it again.  The rest of sides were good.  

My complaint is with the quality of the steaks.  There are just too many steakhouses in the Chicago area that are good to make it this much of a crapshoot.  If you&#39;re spending $150 a person after tip, there shouldn&#39;t be any questions about the quality of the steak you&#39;re going to get.  

i have never eaten at a Morton&#39;s franchise where everyone has been happy with their steak.  That&#39;s a very real problem.  Sadly the Naperville location is not the lone culprit.  

If you&#39;re a gambler, and live in the suburbs, go to Morton&#39;s.  You might have one of the best steaks you&#39;ve ever had.  You can also have one of the worst though.  However if you want consistency then Capital Grille or Gibson&#39;s is a safer bet.  David Burke&#39;s, Keifer&#39;s, and multiple others in the city would never tolerate the consistency problems that Morton&#39;s has.  

Morton&#39;s though at its best, will run circles around the others in the suburbs.  The problem is that there are wild consitency problems.  That&#39;s a very real problem when you&#39;re dropping this much money per person.  

If Morton&#39;s is your only option, go ahead.  I&#39;ve had some remarkable meals there.  Unfortunately you have an equal chance of spending a lot of money on a steak that should be better.  Caveat Emptor."

What&#39;s with the cube for a lobby? There were 6 of us on a Friday afternoon in the bar. It really didn&#39;t matter much because the place was empty. Love the stuffed bar stools, very comfy. We were all over the place on drinks and appetizers. The smoked salmon pizza was pretty good, the mac and cheese was nothing to talk about, even with the bacon. Shrimp cocktail, how do you screw that up? The sauce was way too sweet. The mini crab cakes were mini and the filet sandwiches were shameful. I would not even think of comparing them to Gibson&#39;s. The blue cheese fries would have been awesome. If they didn&#39;t cost almost eleven dollars. And next time try melting the cheese first. The service was good until the end. Our waitress was MIA and we had to get our last couple of drinks from the bartender as well as the outrageous bill. $270 bucks and we didn&#39;t even have dinner. But what we did find out was they didn&#39;t charge us the happy hour prices for the drinks. We called and they told us we were nuts, until we pointed them to their website. Still waiting for the call back.

6/3/2012 Three calls into the manager and all that I get is, he is not in and we will have him call you. Really! From the tumble weeds going by I would assume that the manager had all the time in the world to pick-up or return our call to satisfy a customer. Not asking for anything for free.

This is what they do well. But if you want my opinion there are many other steakhouses in the Chicagoland area that deliver excellent steaks and a great experience at a much more affordable price. Come here all dressed up if you want to impress a date or a client, just keep in mind that the prices you are paying are not because the food is worth it, it&#39;s because they know the high prices and multitude of servers add to perceived value. Also, don&#39;t come here unless you are prepared to spend $80-$100. Appetizer and dessert prices are based on the assumption that you are going to share and side dishes are ala cart. Figure if you want the extras, $15 for an appetizer, $40 or $50 for an entrée, at least $5 dollars for a side, and another $12 for a dessert. You&#39;re already at $80 and that doesn&#39;t even include drinks. Of course the food is good at that price, but you can get good food for much less at any number of places in walking distance from Morton&#39;s."

Because I travel extensively, I&#39;ve happily been exposed to many impressive steak joints, and Mortons more than once. I was in Naperville on business, and decided to seek out a nice dinner; Mortons was instantly at the top of my list. 

As I often do, I sought out a place at the bar to enjoy a cocktail and proceeded to order my dinner &#39;to go.&#39; The &#39;To Go&#39; reaction is sometimes annoying to me (sorry if you don&#39;t like my choice, but if I want this fabulous fare to go, you better make it happen), but if it was negative here, it was quite subdued. I ordered the mixed grill with a 6 ounce filet, three grilled shrimp and two bacon-wrapped scallops, along with lobster bisque and some onion bread.

When I made it back to my hotel, I was delighted with the food - warm, perfectly seasoned and wonderfully accompanied by an orange sauce, what tasted like a hollandaise sauce, butter and a grilled lemon. The steak melted in my mouth, and the shrimp and scallops were very nice, too. The bread - warm and tasty - would&#39;ve been better in a garlic variety, but it was very nice.

So, here&#39;s the deal - the bar service was wonderful, and so was the food. I highly recommend you check out Morton&#39;s in Naperville!"
mortons-the-steakhouse-naperville-2,Meghan S.,q5sz3z7Hf0xWyLnJ8HEmqw,"Naperville, IL",0,1,0,0,37,QwDyLC3suimsiXuPTnKIGg,2.0,2013-09-02,"I took my boyfriend here for his birthday on Saturday night.  I mentioned it in my reservation, and they made sure to include a personalized note at the top of our menus wishing him a happy birthday.  It was a really nice touch, especially all the people who stopped by to wish him a happy birthday.

Other than that, the dinner was just okay.  I started with the blue cheese wedge salad, which was HUGE.  I could have made a meal of that alone.  I&#39;m a sucker for blue cheese wedges, and this one was only okay; I got tired of eating it less than halfway through.  Boyfriend&#39;s Caesar salad  was good, but really garlicky (and just as big).  I ordered the Alaskan halibut and he had the 12 oz filet.  The halibut was supposed to come in a lemon caper sauce, but there was none to be found on my fish, although there were a couple capers.  All in all, not bad, but not very flavorful; I felt like I could have made a better one at home myself.  Boyfriend&#39;s filet was good, but he admitted it wasn&#39;t as good as Sullivan&#39;s.  The food came out pretty quickly, which is normally a bonus, but at a nice restaurant where I&#39;m dropping $100 a person, I don&#39;t want to feel rushed...and I definitely felt rushed.

In total, I paid $200 for a sub-par dinner (no dessert).  The food wasn&#39;t horrible, but it wasn&#39;t great--it certainly didn&#39;t warrant the price, and we definitely won&#39;t be going back.

Bottom line: go to Sullivan&#39;s instead.  MUCH better food, a larger menu, better service and ambience, and a smaller price."

We came here to celebrate our 2nd wedding anniversary. We got there a little early, right after work. But the staff welcomed us in anyway and offered anything off the menu. We were greeted by the general manager and the service was very prompt. 

The food was excellent as well. We started off with broiled scallops wrapped in bacon (3) and onion soup for my wife. We then moved on to the Cajun rib-eye, the best steak I have ever tasted, and the Australian lobster tail, the largest I have ever seen. Everything is ala carte so we ordered a side of garlic roasted green beans and potato skins. They give you the option of butter, sour cream, and bacon with the skins. Just say no, or add it yourself because they just dumped the toppings on and ruined those. The lobster tail was OK, a little dry and the green beans were good. 

Now that said, everything plus 2 glasses of wine ($10/glass) came to $210. That is why I gave the 4 stars and not 5. The steak was the best I have ever had, but not worth the money. 

Will I go back? Maybe. But I would more likely spend the $200 on a mini weekend vacation rather than a night at a steak house."

For the price I was paying, I imagined the place to be comparable to a steakhouse around the same price range (Fogo de Chao, for example). I was extremely disappointed in all aspects.

You get a steak on a plate and that&#39;s it. You don&#39;t get any sides, you have to order them separately. The steak isn&#39;t even that good. I wouldn&#39;t put it over a $20 steak. My wife&#39;s was seared a little too much (on both sides too! did the guy not know how to cook a steak?) and mine came out well done (when I ordered medium). For $12, you get two helpings of mashed potatoes, which were just average, and nobody at the table could touch the balsamic vinegar _drenched_ asparagus (additional $12).

The service was atrocious and we didn&#39;t even go at peak hours. We only wanted three things. 1) More bread 2) Why they still hadn&#39;t given us our sides when we were done with the steaks 3) Dessert menu. Every time we wanted something, we had to look around like giraffes for 10-15 minutes. We gave up on the dessert since our sides came out after the meal as if they were desserts anyway.

I can&#39;t believe that this place is still in business. I would never go back willingly again. Why pay $80 per person for a $10 to $20 restaurant?"
mortons-the-steakhouse-naperville-2,A J.,I7aBLmhU3NdG8Va26W14aA,"Hinsdale, IL",0,1,0,0,7,doLb4GWf5N51-5wwhTKz0Q,5.0,2011-04-20,"I came here with some friends and had a blast.  Great service and fantastic food.  I am a fan and would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking to sink their teeth into some tender steak.

WALKING IN
-----------------

First thing, the entrance is kinda ghetto.  The door is facing west towards the parking lot area, but the valet booth is posted up right next to it.  It appears more like a service side entrance since it is undecorated.  The Cheesecake Factory, for example, has a main entrance with massive doors which leaves little confusion as to where you should enter the structure.

I noticed the restaurant is pretty small, some could call it cozy.  The bar area has about 6-7 seats at bar itself and 4-5 small tables that could seat 3-4 each.  The dining area has approx. 15 tables with wine bottles strewn about, almost looking like a warehouse or distribution center for alcohol hah.  Separating the bar/entrance and the dining area is a massive wine cellar, pretty cool.

I highly recommend making a reservation through OpenTable.  Walking in w/o a reservation could lead to disastrous wait times.  My reservation went without a hitch and we were served promptly.

SERVICE
-------------
Quick, friendly and quasi-entertaining.  Before giving us menus our server brought up a tray with all the meat/entree choices.  It was nice to have a look at what you could order instead of just relying on the menu.  Menus were clear and concise, it was easy to order.

Since i rarely eat at high end restaurants, i went all out with appetizer, entree and dessert:

FOOD
---------

starter = 5 onion soup.  
~~Opinion:  Tasty and just the right amount of food.  My friend had an iceberg salad and it seemed entirely all to much.

entree = Cajun Ribeye (medium)
~~Opinion:  FANTASTIC!!  A generous serving even though it came from the &#39;slightly smaller&#39; steak selection on the menu.  I don&#39;t know what else to say, it was expertly cooked and i enjoyed every ounce.

Sides = Jumbo Asparagus, Mashed potatoes &amp; sauteed spinach/mushrooms
~~Opinion: These were tasty but fairly unremarkable.  Nothing here stood out but they complimented the main entree nicely.  We ordered 3 sides for 5 people and it worked out just right.  The sides are on the small side but it works out okay since the steak is very filling.

dessert = Double Chocolate Mousse
~~Opinion: YUMMMMMMMMMM.  So rich and flavorful, texture was perfect.  I tried my friend&#39;s carrot cake, that was a great choice too.  The frosting wasn&#39;t overpowering and the cake itself was tasty.

OVERALL
--------------

I certainly spent a lot, my bill alone was just about $100 after tax and tip, and this was without any alcohol.  You could do a lot worse or better depending on how spendy you choose to be.

Another thing i wanted to point out was the dress code.  Yelp has it listed as dressy, but you can come here in casual wear.  I was wearing jeans and a sweater.  The website specifically indicates no shorts, t-shirts or sandals.... however i did see one teenager wearing a hoodie+athletic shorts ha!!  So as long as you are respectably clothed, you&#39;re good to go."

Our steaks were perfectly cooked medium. from what my boyfriend tells me the oysters rockefeller was yummy too. I will not eat them so i will have to trust him on this one.  
The reason I only gave this 3 stars was the tables are pretty much on top of each other . I felt like we were dining with the people next to us our tables were maybe 5 or 6 inches away from each other and the waitress never came by to ask if.we wanted dessert she asked the people next to us maybe she thought we were together. She was a very nice waitress and i understand if you didn&#39;t remember whom you asked and whom you didn&#39;t. We are human after all.

Surprisingly, there was zero wait!  Our main entrees were delicious, but the side dishes were average.  The restaurant has a formal, special occasion atmosphere, with friendly staff dressed in bow ties.  When stepping into a Morton&#39;s, you should already know the menu prices are high ($50/entrée). Overall, I can see how some people may really enjoy the place but it&#39;s too formal for me and I&#39;ve had better experiences elsewhere.

Main Entrees:  
Our main entrees (Cajun Ribeye and Large Lump Crabcakes) were really delicious.  The ribeye was juicy with noticeable flavor and the right amount of seasoning.  The three crabcakes were big chunks of crab, lightly fried, served with a tasty lemon hollandaise sauce on the side.   

Side Dishes: 
Our sides (Creamed Spinach and Baked Potato) were average with nothing special about them. A server came by to specifically dress our potato with toppings (sour cream, butter, bacon) in front of us.  That was a nice touch, but the potato dish itself looked and tasted completely regular.  

Staff and Service: 
Our server Ryan was friendly.  There was also a constant flow of staff around handling different types of jobs.  (Main server, appetizer servers, manager who drops by the table, water person, busboy guy, etc.)

Building:  
When entering the front door, it feels like a back or side entrance.  I actually checked around the building to see if we were entering through the correct doorway.  The building owner really needs to consider reconstructing this area.

Prices:  
Our two entrees and two side dishes totaled over $100+.  Definitely check out the menu and prices and ask about specials prior to sitting down.  (I didn&#39;t know we could ask for specials packages until I read others&#39; Yelp! Reviews!)  

Hours of Operation:
This location is open for dinner and select days for lunch.  If you are thinking about taking work guests there for lunch, it&#39;s best to call and check the available daytime dates first."

It has always been my go-to special occasion spot--a place I knew would deliver delicious food and a great atmosphere time and again.

I heard that the chain had been purchased by Houston-based restaurant operator Landry&#39;s Inc. (who also owns McCormick &amp; Schmick&#39;s, Rainforest Cafe and Bubba Gump Shrimp Co... oh boy). Obviously, I was not happy to hear the ownership had changed, but I was hoping the new owners would stay true to the original formula that worked so well for this Chicago classic.

I visited the Naperville location for a birthday dinner recently - it was my first time back since the acquisition. I have to say, it was an all-around terrible experience.

It was a Saturday night, so it was understandably busy. The tables were arranged on top of each other, and the wait staff was running around so quickly they nearly knocked into each other and us many times. But for as many waiters as we saw running around, we had awful service. We had more than one server introduce themself, then disappear, so we weren&#39;t even sure who our main server was. They repeatedly disappeared throughout the meal... it took 30+ minutes each time we needed them: to order, to receive our food, to get our bill. When my food came out and the steak was bleeding raw (I ordered it medium), it took me 20 minutes to find a server to send it back.

The food was sad. Morton&#39;s steaks used to be fresh, juicy, and cooked to perfection. These steaks were of average quality--not much better than something you&#39;d get at a run-of-the-mill Outback Steakhouse. As I mentioned, they were extremely undercooked. Between waiting to send it back and the time it took to cook it more, my sides went cold. The steak came back even sadder than before... not tender or prepared with any sort of care, just a bit darker.

The sides and salads were OK--nothing to write home about, but no complaints. The one thing that was great (and always has been great) was their chocolate lava cake. Thankfully, they did not mess with that one! Also, they did take my meal off the bill and apologized, which was appreciated but not enough to redeem the experience.

Overall, the sub-par food quality, bad service, and less-than-relaxing atmosphere proved to me that the Morton&#39;s I once knew and loved is gone.

I wonder if I can just carry out the lava cake and skip the rest of the mess?"

Ray our server was not disengaged, forgot about us a couple of times, left plates on our table as he walked by multiple times and the best part, when they brought my bowl of Luke warm lobster bisque, he spilled half on the table. He scooped it up with his crumb collector and walked off. No sorry, or let me get you another bowl. When I asked him about it, he literally looked at me dumbfounded. 

We went on 01/19/13 for my wife&#39;s birthday. My steak was burnt (suppressed to be medium rare) my wife&#39;s lobster was ok, but the waiter fibbed when she asked if they used butter or that fake oil crud to dip it in. He said they used butter but it was clearly not. 

So bad food, bad service. The new remodel was nice, I wish they would have kept the Westchester location open,  used to go their monthly and never had an issue. I even wrote a letter to Morton&#39;s with no response. Best of luck to them in the future. Annie Morton would be rolling over in his grave..."

They probably also tip 12% because the prices are so high.

This isn&#39;t an average steakhouse. If you want a $20 steak with a side salad with ranch, then go to outback. Expect to pay around $70-$100 a person and have a phenomial meal. The Porterhouse is world class and the filet has a great, unique flavor.  The sides can easily be split between 2 people, unless you&#39;re a magoo.

The cocktails are mixed very well and in a glass that Leo McGarry would appreciate. I absolutely loved their manhattan

We celebrated our 5 yr anniversary there and they gave us a customized menu that was a nice touch and a complementary dessert.

They have a solid bar special right now for $6 martini&#39;s and $7 cocktails and 1/2 apps that is very reasonable if you don&#39;t want a full meal or just need a quick drink."

Every person we encountered was like that, from the gracious welcome when we walked in to barely being able to take a few sips of our water without being topped off again.

The food was all incredibly delicious. We all had steaks, which are ala carte. The sides and desserts were amply sized, easy to share. The onion bread loaf in the beginning was a big hit with all of us. We did not try the wine, but our drinks from the bar were definitely mixed well.

It was time to celebrate 15 years of a life sentence (anniversary on 2/11) and we decided to stay out West instead of going into the city.....which we probably should have done.

The place has the strangest entrance I have been in....beautiful on the outside you open the door and go into a really small/ugly space, then you open another door and head into the bar/reception area. This was a Thursday night around 7:30 pm and I had not made a reservation, but the place was probably 60% full. Hostess was incredibly nice and seated us at a booth along the back (it was by the windows and pretty cold).

The place looks like a traditional Morton&#39;s, and would fit well in the city. I think its WAY over the top for Naperville, trying to be something that it is not in a suburban setting....... 

Our server, Kailey, was EXCELLENT, and the service throughout the night was perfect. We had heard they had a priced fixed menu, and although it was not initially offered to us, when we asked it was offered. It is a salad, app, dessert, and entree (reduced size) for $49.99.

Hot Mamma started with a campaign (16.95) and I had a Chimay - but had not idea it was $24, I did like the iced wine bucket they brought over to keep it cold!

I didn&#39;t want a salad or app, just a steak and the price of that by itself was 49.99. The steak is HUGE but not great, and I probably only ate 1/2 of it...but $49 for a steak???? Hot Mamma had the sea scallops (great) and the fillet (ok). They made a big deal that it was our anniversary, free desert and even came over and took a picture and put it in a (paper) frame for us at no additional charge.

The service was GREAT, the food was wonderful, but I still think its overpriced. Its more than I have paid for some unbelievable dinners in the city and through out the country......maybe priced right for a city center, but not Western suburbs.

My second visit was what cemented my love for this paradise. I ordered the Prime Rib and every bite was a piece of heaven. Steak, the way it was meant to be eaten!

I had the filet - perfect.  Hubby had the Cajun Ribeye, our guests had the Sea Bass and Veal Chops.  All perfectly prepared and delish!  Our shared sides included garlic mashed potatoes, grilled aparagas and truffle french fries.

We had ordered chocolate souffle for desert (order when putting in your dinner order).  Steven came out to tell us that our souffle had &#34;fallen&#34; when coming out of the oven - it would be an add&#39;l 25 mins... but... not only was the souffle &#34;on the house&#34;, we could order another dessert &#34;on the house&#34; to hold us over!

I like how convenient their location is and I like knowing I can pop in on any day of the week for a drink special and a cheap meal. I&#39;ve been here about 3 times now on a Monday, and a couple Fridays. Seems like a good local spot to watch a game as well, so maybe my husband and I will come in for the next Bears game.

Unfortunately, the first time we wanted to come in for dinner and drinks they had a private party utilizing all of their tables in the back room. This caused the front of the bar to be super packed and there wasn&#39;t anywhere to sit not even up at the bar. This was also probably because they had live music happening up front as well - wish we could have stayed to enjoy that! But sadly, we left and had to go somewhere else for a quick bite (not the best first impression, but it happens).

The other two times I came in I&#39;ve had great experiences with my friends! I&#39;ve sat out on their outdoor patio and also at a high top table inside the bar. Drink specials were great both times - I was all about their $3.50 Oktoberfest and $5 domestic pitchers. Not bad, not bad at all. 

The food is good! Nothing to get all hyped up about (again, nothing fancy), but it&#39;s worth ordering! I&#39;ve had their nachos, chopped salad, and Philly cheese chicken sandwich and fries and I thought it was all delicious! Great compliment to a cold beer - which they definitely have. I was actually pleasantly surprised to be given a frosted glass with super cold beer. Always a win in my book.

My experience with their service so far has been 50/50. I&#39;ve had one waitress who was pretty out there. It could have been a cultural thing (I think her accent was Russian), but she made my friends and I feel a tad strange with some of her judging remarks. She also would walk away when we were mid-sentence asking for something. At one point we asked for water and she literally said &#34;Really, just water? You&#39;re not going to have another beer?&#34;. Um...yeah. So there&#39;s that. I&#39;ll decide what I&#39;d like to drink thank you very much. On the other hand - I&#39;ve also had a wonderfully helpful servers! They were so sweet and checked in on us frequently.

Regardless, if you live in the area, definitely check out Paulie&#39;s for yourself and enjoy a casual dinner and a drink! I wouldn&#39;t drive too far for a visit, but I think it&#39;s a great local spot."

So, I suggested Paulie&#39;s, as it&#39;s close to home, has a full bar, and we were enticed by a few menu items.

We arrive to see a party of three on the patio but that was it. Inside was fairly quiet as well, except for a large, loud group of twenty-somethings gettin&#39; their &#34;drank on.&#34; The interior is pretty bare-bones; minimalistic, even. Not very impressive. We took a seat (&#34;seat yourselves&#34;) at a high top table and began to browse the menu. I expected our server to immediately pounce to our table and take our drink order.... but no. Five minutes later, we were finally approached by our waitress. We ordered Bloody Mary&#39;s and continued to decide on some grub.

When the girl returned with our drinks, we placed our order. I chose the Chicken Parmesan Sandwich: your choice of breaded or grilled chicken, covered in marinara and melted mozzarella on garlic toasted, thick cut sour dough bread. (I picked grilled, natch). M opted for the Turkey Bacon Pretzel Roll Melt (no tomato). As I went to take a sip of my drink, M looks at it and goes &#34;What IS that?&#34; I look to see the paper piece from inside a bottle top (probably the Worcestershire sauce)  floating in my drink. I laughed and picked it out. NBD, it&#39;s not like it was hair or a fly.

Our food arrived and we dug in. The french fries are amazing. The funny thing is, they tasted like calamari slightly... but they don&#39;t serve calamari. It was obvious that they do not fry in fresh oil, as you can taste other food flavors on the french fries. I guess that&#39;s why I enjoyed them so much.I loved their coleslaw, no complaints there.

As for my sandwich, it was extremely greasy and immediately I knew I&#39;d have a wrecked belly later on. I decided that maybe only eating half would keep the intestinal distress at bay. The chicken was okay, loved the marinara and mozzarella. The bread was delicious, but too greasy.  M enjoyed his food though; he didn&#39;t leave a crumb (god, I wish I had his metabolism). Their food is pretty pricey, IMO. We initially wanted some appetizers but when we saw that they cost nearly the same as the entrees, we scrapped that idea rather quickly.

It seems much of the waitstaff working that day (flirtacious, inexperienced girls all under 24) cared more about tending to their regulars than anything else. Those waiting on tables looked bored. We waited a bit too long for our server to return with a box for me, and then finally the check. Not entirely her fault, as she was the only server out on the floor, at least that I could tell. 

Be warned, their AC definitely works. I had a case of &#34;The Goose&#34; during my entire visit (goosebumps). That alone did not encourage a lengthy visit. Another contributing factor was that rowdy party of twenty-somethings a few tables away. One of &#39;em went to the Touch Tones music player, put on some hip hop or rap or something along those lines, and thug walked his way back to his table. We quickly paid our tab before drunken shenanigans could ensue and..... exit stage left. 

While I didn&#39;t love or hate Paulie&#39;s, I didn&#39;t fully enjoy my experience here. Mainly from the Antarctic AC, but the overall atmosphere is just as cold and sterile."

Mixed drinks can be ordered in short or tall sizes, which is a nice perk. 

I&#39;ve ordered burgers, wraps and pizza here. Their pizza was like &#39;holy cow&#39; good.

I putted 20 cash and I told her rest put on the car. She comes back with that amount and I asked her where&#39;s the cash. She tells me I&#39;ve never gave her cash. I was like really ???? Then she says I did give her cash but she gave it back to me. Real really? Girl are you dumb or what? I was so pissed off. Then she says I&#39;ll be right back.

I live and work down the street from this location. In fact, I often take my staff there for lunch a couple times a month. Today one of my employees turned 50, so six of us went to Paulie&#39;s for lunch. Wait times are normally somewhat longer than most restaurants, but the food is always good so we don&#39;t mind. Today was a different story.. The entire floor of the restaurant had 5 tables. Three 2-tops, one 3-top, and our group of six. There were 5 people sitting at the bar and a table sitting on the patio. It took 1 hour 10 minutes for our FOOD TO SHOW UP! By the time we ate, paid, and got back to work, we spent 2-hours on lunch. Given my payroll, I paid employees $534 for that extra hour of non-productivity. Now please tell me, why would I consider bringing my staff back for lunch? Instead of spending $100 on a meal, I now have to consider a $500 opportunity cost. I understand it&#39;s a Monday and probably not staffed all that well, but the place wasn&#39;t busy. 

The server thanked us for our patience 3 or 4 times as our food came out staggered. This means she realized we waited too long for food, but we were never greeted by a manager to help diffuse the irritation of waiting. 

I&#39;ve been a service consultant for bars/restaurants for many years. It&#39;s proven that a poor experience at a restaurant is a golden opportunity for an establishment to create repeat business. Food for thought... A customer is more likely to come back if they&#39;ve had a poor experience fixed more so than a customer that had a good experience from start to finish. 

My staff and I won&#39;t come back unless we are motivated by Paulie&#39;s. Your move."

As trivia first-timers, a group of friends and myself were looking for a fun local pub to join... And not one of those click-the-machines-at-the-table, sorta anti-social trivias. We wanted something genuine, fun, and where folks actually interact. We stumbled across Paulie&#39;s trivia online (held every other Thurs) and read some positive reviews, so this past Thursday (2/20/14) we gave it a whirl....

The male/female host duo (I forget their names) were super warm and welcoming. The game play and rules etc were pretty self explanatory and easy to follow. It was a very comforting crowd size: not overwhelming, yet not so few that it felt lame. And a very diverse age group. Most with a decent wealth of knowledge and a silly sense of humor (hence most of the &#34;unique&#34; team names, including our own).

Maybe it was beginners luck, but as &#34;newbies&#34; we went into it with no expectations and wound up killing it! Won 1st place, at that! Who knew?? Clueless that prizes were even involved, our team walked away with tickets to an amazing local playhouse in downtown Aurora, and a $50 gift card to Paulie&#39;s for next time! ......not $10....not $20....$50!

As far as the pub itself, I didn&#39;t order food, but the pals that did got their orders relatively quickly, and had nothing but good things to say (considering it&#39;s pub food). Amazing drink deals. There were $3.50 you-call-it&#39;s. There were $2.50 Labatt Blues with free refills from the (quite slowly rotating) &#34;Labatt Girl&#34;. And the coldest, most refreshingly crisp Fat Tire I&#39;ve had in a long while. Our waitress was a total sweetheart, but a tad slow (granted she had a trainee tag-a-long, been there done that and I know it sucks). But we were so engulfed in trivia, that 20-minute waits on pint refills didn&#39;t even feel that lengthy!

All-in-all it was a super fun (inexpensive) and entertaining night! Trivia was done by 945-10pm, which isn&#39;t all that bad for us folks who have to show up functionable on a Friday morning. When the final round was over, our table was surrounded not only by the hosts, but by quite a lot of the other competition, who wanted to say an official &#34;welcome&#34; and &#34;congratulations&#34; to us. They were all so great, and we didn&#39;t feel like outsiders anymore. Open arms for sure. Good times, and we&#39;ll definitely be back. I would suggest Paulie&#39;s to anybody. Especially those who are looking to try trivia out for the first time. 

Thanks, Paulie&#39;s trivia crew!"

Also, I was fairly disappointed with the Turkey Bacon Pretzel Roll Melt, as the Turkey appeared to be of the Carl Buddig variety, and the pretzel roll was mealy.  An excellent Arnold Palmer is available for us lunch time teetotalers, and the fries are pretty tasty.

Sure as a business grows there will be a few bad apples hired and let go in order to find the right team but as of right now, THEIR TEAM IS A ROCKIN! Great service Friday night. Never had to ask for a refill on my Oberon. There was some type of party or wedding reception with a DJ going on in the bar so lots of patrons were on the patio enjoying the night air because inside was a thumping. No biggie, I prefer the patio anyway. Great job getting your staff on point Paulie! Keep up the great work!"

Good gathering place with friends, nice outdoor patio and some big screens to watch the game. The food is better than other local bars like The Foundry and The Town. However, the service and management are subpar most days. There are 1 or 2 waitresses I really like but most often the service is slow or they mess up the orders. It has been a bit better in recent months, but the thing that annoys me most is when they run out of stuff - beer, limes, entrees. Ridiculous that they should run out of a particular beer on a Tuesday or a Friday. Or any day for that matter. If the bar is fairly empty you might want to think about going down the street to the Town. This place could be so much better. LOVE the potato burrito though."
paulies-pub-and-grille-aurora,Michael L.,0e7dzj0DfCJngssbymSMFg,"Chicago, IL",0,1,0,2,27,6y_GpCyWShGOKvdwdmv05Q,2.0,2013-12-17,"It started off with a lot of promise but has been consistently lousy the last several times we have tried going in.  With so many other options in the area, I doubt we will be back.  We&#39;ve been here about 8-9 times mainly because the first two times, we loved it and had a great time:  Good service, great food, friendly crowd, no issues, well priced.  We really liked the place initially and wanted to continue liking it so we kept coming back hoping that they would get it back on track and that we&#39;d have a hidden gem we could rely on.

Flashforward to last Friday when we wanted to stop in and do some drinks and appetizers (maybe even have dinner, we were on the fence) and just relax a bit after what had been a long week punctuated by a long day.  For starters, they were out of limes.  Not a huge issue, we could easily order drinks that didn&#39;t require a lime...

Now the cynic in me emerges: OR we could just go home and fix our own drinks and stay in the house-we actually have limes there...and no we aren&#39;t running a bar out of our place...

Now the pragmatist in me speaks: OR the management simply could have easily gone across the street to purchase a bag of limes from the Dominick&#39;s store that can&#39;t be more than 300 yards away.  Small issue but it started the experience off poorly.  Next, we ordered the cheese curds to pick at while we went over the menu and had a few drinks to get things started...it took over 15 minutes from ordering them to get the order and when they came out they were stone cold....which is an awesome way to enjoy an app that essentially amounts to fried cheese.  

Now this would generally be forgivable if the place was absolutely slammed or something, but it was 3:30/4:00 on Friday afternoon and sadly there was only one other table seated with two people and 3-4 people total seated at the bar.  This seemed to be the problem, as the staff was mostly engaged with the two patrons and the bartender at the very far end of the bar near the restrooms.  

No biggie, we full well understand taking care of and catering to your regulars and we weren&#39;t in a rush, but when we have to alter our drink order because you are out of a staple at any bar, THEN you serve us cold food, and THEN we need to chase you down to order more drinks in an empty bar because you&#39;re so absorbed in two patrons that you&#39;re ignoring everyone else in the building...thanks but I think we&#39;re good.  The total kicker was that they were miffed when we wanted to close out after two rounds and a stone cold app....which to add insult took an agonizingly long time (10-12 minutes from request for check to getting it) because our server got hung up in conversation with the VIPs on her way back with our check.  We didn&#39;t complain(after all what&#39;s the point really), we just settled up and left, I actually ended up way OVERtipping because I didn&#39;t want to wait for change, and only had 20&#39;s on me.  

We won&#39;t be back, which is sad because the place is well located and has a ton of potential.  One last thought, in the year or so we have been going in there, we have never had the same server or bartender twice.  Now neither one of us is Jon Taffer (actually we are pretty sure even Taffer couldn&#39;t save this place) but even we know that when an establishment has crazy high staff turnover that&#39;s never a good sign."

Had the buffalo burger (burger with wing sauce, blue cheese) and wife had the potato burrito.  Both were OK.  The fries were the best part.  Very good.  Probably would order something different if I went back.  Good beer choices, though.

Service good:
Had a woman with lots of tattoos and she was the nicest girl (cute, too) in the place and we tipped well because she kept bringing drinks without being asked.  I kept trying to look at all the tattoos, but was afraid of being a pervy lurker.  Well, if you have that many tattoos, you have to be used to people looking, right?      

Service bad:
All the waitstaff kept congregating at a table by the bar, hanging out, talking, eating.  I&#39;ve seen Bar Rescue enough to know that stuff like that shouldn&#39;t be tolerated.  Bad for business.  

Terrible Management (TAKE NOTE): 
At a table next to us was a group of older guys who were yelling and screaming and one guy in particular was threatening to beat the hell out of another couple of guys and NOBODY from the waitstaff or management stepped in.  It was loud, uncomfortable and obnoxious.  Good managers would have quieted it down if not asked them to leave.  I don&#39;t blame the waitstaff, which is all women.  It&#39;s intimidating dealing with a bunch of drunk jack@sses.  Yes, it&#39;s a bar.  Yes, bars are loud.  But when you have to sit and think about this rather than enjoy the atmosphere, it&#39;s a fail.   

There are too many good pubs and bars in the Western Suburbs (Two Brothers, Peggy Kinane&#39;s, Fox &amp; Hound to name three in the area) than to come back to a place where management is non-existent."

They also have a large area that can be partitioned off for private parties, so it might be a place to think about if you&#39;re planning an event.

I will definitely repeat."

I actually think this place has a ton of potential, but let me explain. lets start with I walk in with my wife at about 12 noon on a tuesday(peak lunch time), and I&#39;m surprised to see that the place is not packed.
the server tells us to sit anywhere and she will be right with us, O.k. great, but this place is not small and there are people spread around at various tables both inside and out. I then realize that there is only 1 server, like I said the place was not packed by any means but there was approx. 8-9 tables occupied. 
We got the water we ordered pretty quick, and that&#39;s where it all started to go down hill. We would have ordered an appetizer except it took about 10-15 minutes before the server returned, and neither of us wanted to get the appetizer and entree at the same time, so we just ordered the entree&#39;s. buffalo chicken sandwich for my wife and the potato burrito for me.
Approx. another 10-12 minutes for the food to come.
now I have to admit the burrito was REALLY GOOD, and the chicken sandwich was also really good, unfortunately our fresh cut french fries tasted like FISH. not exactly the end of the world, but I&#39;m a vegetarian and it was a little off putting, but I&#39;m not a fanatic so I ate my fries cause they were still pretty o.k.
I think I understand why this place was not packed, I can&#39;t blame the server, I mean hey, she was all alone.....SORTA. there was a guy running around kinda frantically trying to be sure that he at least say hi to everyone and ask if everything was o.k. my guess is that this guy was PAULIE. I assuming this since thats what the server called him :) 
Anyway, if this is Paulie the owner, then there is the problem. 
If Paulie is reading this I want him to know that he has a really nice establishment that has a ton of potential, and maybe I came on an off day, but if not, then here are my suggestions.
1. have more than 1 server available at peak lunch times
2. Fresh oil!! or at least separate fryers
The food is really good and the place is really nice, unfortunately because of 2, actually really 1 big problem with staffing what would have been a really great lunch, was just unfortunate. 
sorry if the review seemed long winded, it may seem like there was really no big deal, but had you been there it may have made more sense."

It&#39;s a great sports bar with better food than your average pub fare. The cheese curds are our favorite and the pizza is better than expected. But I&#39;ve had a major gripe with Paulie&#39;s over the last few months. I love draft craft beer but they seriously need to clean their draft lines. It&#39;s a major problem. I&#39;ve tried numerous craft beers each visit and they taste nothing like how the beer should. The Goose Island Green Line doesn&#39;t taste hoppy at all and the Bell&#39;s Oberon is close to tasteless. I&#39;m really disappointed and I don&#39;t want to find another bar but I will if this isn&#39;t addressed. I hope this is resolved soon. If it is I will happily update my rating.

I&#39;ve been there several times to celebrate a job going greatly well and have enjoyed myself eat and every time.  The first was a night of drinking to celebrate a promotion, which ended in a very reasonable tab and colorful conversations with the staff.  The atmosphere was very welcoming while at the same time maintaining an air of night life danger without the actual danger.  The music was varied and not intrusive, something that many bars over do.

When visiting to have dinner or lunch, it seems like an entirely different experience.  With a very accessible dining section that is slightly isolated from the bar area, it feature a pub style menu that takes me back to my days of college.

I highly suggest Paulie&#39;s to anyone in the western suburbs looking for a fun place to spend a little down time or celebrate.

PS: The cheese curds are delicious."

If there was ANY other bar within walking distance, I&#39;d go there.   I don&#39;t know what it is about this place, the decor is non-existent, the beer and food are overpriced and the food isn&#39;t that good.  The service is hit or miss, but more often miss.  
The beer selection is big, but they have the highest beer prices anywhere in the area and almost no beer specials ever.  
The food is very overpriced and is just average bar food, but in smaller then average portions.  They have a very good potato and steak burrito on the menu, but it&#39;s over $11 and isn&#39;t much bigger then a Taco Bell Burrito.
If you never check this place out, you aren&#39;t missing anything.  Just an average bar in a strip mall."

We love the cheddar pints as an appetizer - get them almost everytime! Our other menu favorites include the southwest chicken wrap, spinach chicken melt, and chicken parm sandwich. We recently also tried the beer crust pizza, which was also good. Paulie&#39;s has the coldest beer we&#39;ve ever had, and their Friday Goose Island specials are our favorite. They also have a room in the back that they rent out for parties. No charge to rent the room, and you can customize your menu and drink selections for whatever you want.

Great beer and liquor selection, super specials, and a fun atmosphere are a major plus. Pizza and beer pitcher special during NFL games is a real deal at $12. 

My only complaint is that management seems to frequently understaff this establishment, leaving the bartender or just one other server to take care of far too many customers when the crowds hit, and they do - even on occasional weekday afternoons. Service can be extremely slow due to this. I&#39;m hoping Paulie (he&#39;s there often making the rounds but has never introduced himself to me) adjusts for this soon.

It used to be my go to local bar that had great food and service, but I feel like it has started to fall apart over the last 2 years. Their food is slightly over priced for bar food, but they have excellent drink deals that more than make up for it. The burger is great when it is cooked right. Sometimes its cooked perfect, other times, its cooked way too long. Their spicy chicken sandwich is awesome. A lot of kick to it, but is very flavorful. Their fries are the best around. They used to be a great spot for watching UFC fights, and claimed to be the #1 spot for UFC, and used to claim NEVER A COVER for UFC. That quickly went away and they started charging cover, and now they no longer carry the fights.  I do not know if its bad luck, but I have gone there 2x over the last year, and they were closed due to a private party. Both were Saturday nights.

Good beer selections, good service/bartenders. Get the feeling that there are a lot of regulars, so not the best place to mingle. My only real complaint is the interior - it kind of feels cafeteria - ish. Tables are super close together, it&#39;s always way too bright in there, not set up to be really social and fun. More like sit at your table, watch the game, and drink your beer."

Recently, I went there with a friend for a few drinks, and we sat at the bar.  I ordered a Crown straight up.  I got a rocks glass that was over half full with Crown.  And their rocks glasses are oversized.  It was a gargantuan pour.  I was astonished.  While I was attempting to finish it, I noticed they had Johnnie Walker Blue.  For a neighborhood bar, Blue Label is a very unique find.  Given my dinosaur-sized pour of Crown, I was wondering if I could get the same amount of Blue for the price of a single drink.  First, I asked the price.  $35.  Very reasonable.  If you go anywhere in Naperville, you&#39;ll be lucky to get Blue Label for less than $45.  So even if they only gave me the standard 1oz pour, I was still ahead of the game.  What I got can only be described as a swimming pool of Blue Label.  I was flabbergasted.  Nay, I was gobsmacked.  Hell, I don&#39;t know what I was, but I was definitely feeling no pain.  A pour like that at any other bar *anywhere* would have been over $100 easy.  Probably north of $150.  Go for the burgers, go to enjoy a couple beers on the patio in the summer, but if you&#39;re a scotch lover, you need to get over there and order a Blue Label before they come to their senses."

A lot of potential, but not quite what it could be. A great location, a beautifully designed inside, and spacious parking lot is accompanied by average everything: staff, food, drinks, even patrons. Nothing special about their prices either, pretty typical. Usually if I&#39;m drawn to a sports bar, one of them has to stand out. In this case, you won&#39;t be blow away by any of the above, but you won&#39;t be terribly disappointed either. Hardly a ringing endorsement, which is exactly what I&#39;m giving them. There are better  places within minutes of this place, and while here I was always thinking I&#39;d be better off at one of them. Most places I like have a staff that at least appears to be strongly invested in their bar&#39;s reputation. I didn&#39;t see that anywhere here. When at other places the clientele looks like they feel at home, they&#39;re glad to be there, or seem part of the place. There&#39;s no such feel to this place, and in fact the patrons seem to be more compartmentalized, individual groups rather than one mass of people who regularly get along. In fact, the folks I encountered seemed very standoffish. There just seems no warmth to this place at all."

I happen to be driving along and noticed Kitaro. The place is very nice from the inside and seems quite upscale. They offer sushi and teppanyaki style food - there are no table grills that I noticed. From the moment I walked in, the place was bustling and quite full, which is always a good sign. It actually looks like a really cool place to bring a date too. 

I dined alone, so Victoria (restaurant manager) asked me about my taste in food and beer. She suggested I get this sweet potato beer, which was delicious and didn&#39;t taste sweet at all. It was so good that I ordered a second one! Victoria also suggested a couple of rolls of sushi to fit my taste. The food was delicious and beautifully presented. Overall I was very pleased with the restaurant and the warm service they provided. Remember, I moved from Chicago and have traveled to many cities across the globe, so this is definitely 5 stars in my experience. I&#39;ll definitely be back."

The three of us went out for dinner. Two of us eat sushi, and one doesn&#39;t. The sushi was fine, nothing incredibly special but still good. The third meal was terrible. Chicken and steak with clear soup as a starter was the order. The chicken was super dry, and the steak was just atrocious! When we mentioned it to the waitress, she said she would speak to the manager. The waitress came back and informed us we would see a 10% discount on the bill. Well, it was 10% off the meal. The bill was a bit north of $140, and stayed there. $2.50 off the bill. Laughable, really. 
As for the service, the server couldn&#39;t really get a handle on things. We waited for over a half hour for the chicken and steak to come out, and it took three  reminders to get water, among other issues.
Overall, I&#39;m not sure how Kitaro stays in business. If there was any other sushi place in ten miles, I&#39;m sure Kitaro wouldn&#39;t  be able to keep the lights on."

When you dine on Wednesdays, you get bogo half price house and specialty maki.....Now I will share the single downside I encountered. The bathroom.

Now let&#39;s talk about the &#34;spider&#34; roll I ordered..Should have been called a tempura roll instead. Absolutely no crab in it what so ever. It was half burnt, my dog wouldn&#39;t even eat it.  The eel was tough and did not taste fresh. If you are a sushi restaurant and your basic maki rolls are not even edible, there is definitely something wrong. I could have stopped at the Jewel next door for a tastier California roll. 

I have taken out here quite a few times, but today topped the cake.. I tried hard to enjoy this place. It is unfortunate that I will not be returning and I wasted $30 dollars, which I&#39;ll probably see in my toilet bowl shortly."

The food is over priced and talking with some previous employees i know its not worth what they give you. They will serve people based on if they know them. My friend talks to the owner so when she gets food to go they will always stuff her to go box. And when i get food they give me the bare minimum so i think thats unfair. The floors are sticky and dirty. My daughter picked up her napkins or chopsticks multiple times  having hair on it.

One of my pet restaurant peeves is when your entree is brought to you within 5 minutes of receiving your appetizer, and this place does this constantly.  When a restaurant does this, it automatically makes you rush with your food.  This evening for example, we deliberately placed our appetizer order first and waited to place our entree order, but this still happened.  I have even asked the waitress not to bring our entree until we were finished with the appetizer and I was actually told, &#34;sorry the kitchen is working fast today&#34;.  Really? Not my problem.  Frankly if it wasn&#39;t for the fact that my husband loves sushi we wouldn&#39;t come here.  That being said, our options in this area are limited for sushi and their food is excellent.

I&#39;m a big sushi fan and have had my fair share of good and bad sushi. I love that everything is very fresh and full of flavor and not drenched in sauce.... I recommend the Ocean Drive maki roll (spicy tuna, cilantro, soy wrap, jalapeño, lime) it was honestly the best flavor combination I&#39;ve tried in awhile. The fresh sliced apple really made the sushi pop and since I&#39;m not a fan of ginger, wasabi or soy sauce it was up lifting to see something different on the plate! I also recommend the magic tuna roll too ... The chocolate soufflé with salted carmel middle was also amazing!

Now the only down side to this is that portions are small and it is expensive but the service and quality of food make it! Happy hour is the best time to go - BOGO 1/2 which is not too shabby.

My husband and I have tried sushi at many different restaurants and the sushi here is amazing. It&#39;s very fresh and flavorful. Sushi in general can be a bit pricey so I recommend going during their happy hour (buy one roll, get one 1/2 off).

Their fried rice is also very delicious which includes grilled, fresh vegetables and it&#39;s not greasy. The staff is pleasant and the decor is not what you would expect in a suburban shopping mall. This place is a great place for a romantic dinner or for friends just getting together."

 Title: Never fails to underwhelm. 
Best: Zen-like atmosphere of decor
Worst: very un-Zen-like vibe of most of the staff. Hurried/harried. All niceties out the window. Wait times looonnng.
Best: consistently good sushi. Better than the Orland alternatives. 
Worst: they always seemed pricey, but not anymore. Hmmmm.

After 4 visits: great food but expect service issues."

The miso soup was awesome then came the rolls we ordered. The funny thing is the restaurant was completely empty and our order was messed up . Our waitress was gone and didnt come back to the table untill we were almost finished. I have never been so dissatisfied with the presentation and the sushi was lacking in flavor.

My first impression was from the hostess who seemed a bit miffed that we reserved a table for seven. (I accidentally made it for two people on open table because that was the default, but I corrected it to seven immediately) she kinda made a big deal about having to put tables together, and I was confused why considering 85% of the restaurant was empty on a Saturday night. 

I found the answer to their lack of customers... It was the nasty smell of sewer in the bathroom. (That was my second impression) I literally plugged my nose the whole time while trying to wash my hands... Not easy!

My third impression was the shrimp gyoza. These were some of the best gyoza I&#39;ve ever had. Deliciously crispy outside and the perfect amount of filling. 

My fourth impression was the lobster roll. It was so small in size I thought it was from a grocery chain fridge. It tasted like just tempura and nothing else. EXTREMELY disappointing since it was $18!!! The roll had 1.5 layers of rice and no other filling. Bland, bland, bland.  I would have no problem paying 18 for an exceptional roll, especially a unique one with lobster.

The next roll we ordered was sex in the city roll. It was bland and very mushy inside. Was not impressed at all. Another 14$ wasted. 

I had a hibiscus martini like drink. This was good and very strong, needed a smidge more sweetness. But overall pretty good.

The last impression made me the most upset. Me and my husband had put own check while his brother and his family had their own check. We did not order very much as a whole and was not there very long but for some reason both of our checks had an automatic gratuity of 20%. I was pissed! I was only pissed because the food sucked, the bathroom smelled and the service was sub par. I usually give at least 20% for great food and service but the fact that I was forced to give them 15$ that was not deserved earns me the right to say I will never go back here and will tell others the same. 
(I was a server for nearly 8 years and understand the importance of added gratuity for large parties or people taking way too long to leave in your section!!)

Only one star because the gyoza were amazing and the drinks got me a bit buzzed, but this place does not earn the right to charge downtown upscale prices with these MAJOR flaws and sub par food!!!!!!!!  Take your money to YUCCA in Orland Park!!!"

It was just before 1 pm and the place was empty which is  shame. 

The atmosphere is sophisticated and  romantic (dark and intimate)
The presentation is wonderful 
Quality and price really good. 

My sister had a lunch special that comes on white plates and includes soup or salad, tempura, rice, and her entree --- lovely and delicious

I had a 2 maki classic roll special with miso soup ($2 extra):  included  a Clafornia roll and a shrimp crunch tempura roll for $10. 

My only disappointment was a stingy amount of white ginger. 

The service was adequate but not overt. 

I am a fan and will return!"

I just expect a better service, a fair amount of food serving, a food served warm when its supposed to be warm and better presented deserts tantamount to how much I paid.

Anytime I&#39;ve passed by it has been dead, and today was no exception. Overall I enjoyed what I tried. I&#39;d stick with the pork gyoza instead of the shrimp, crab rangoon were decent, and my favorite roll is definitely the Lemontster. This place is quite pricey compared to most others I&#39;ve been to, and while the food is decent, I probably won&#39;t make it a regular stop since the value and quality aren&#39;t up to par with the price.

But real authentic Japanese food is crisp, clean and beautiful. I was there on a Saturday night, the place was empty. The sushi was fresh enough, though portions were small. I had the chef&#39;s special which consisted of chefs choice 5 pieces of sushi and a choice of one roll. Miso soup and a small salad.
ON PAPER the roll sounded excellent spicy tuna, avacado , and crab. In reality it was engulfed in some sort of thick gooey sweet , syrupy sauce, with thick ribbons of mayonaise and corn syrup covering any semblance of flavor of the actual ingrediants. 
The ambiance is geared to a young hip crowd but none were present. They are pumping house or dance music, which is extremely repetious and annoying. Also steel chop sticks along with a fork , authentic Japanese use wooden chopsticks , steel has no grip. The ingredients of real Japanese food is in there , unfortunately it is smothered in high fructose corn syrup and fat. I will drive the 10 miles to Yokohama in Westmont even though Kitaro is one mile from my house. 
Don&#39;t try to Americanize the Japanese food and experience, that&#39;s what I go to sushi bars to get away from !"

I discovered Kitaro after having to come down to Lockport to pick my husband up from work (motorcycle accident, long story, yadda yadda). We had intended to go to somewhere else, but after getting lost from bad GPS directions and with some serious food rage coming on, I pounced on Kitaro after seeing it while turning around in the strip mall&#39;s parking lot.

The interior was totally unexpected; very smooth, cool and calming. Nestled in a booth towards the back we indulged in some really nice sea urchin shooters. The octopus salad was tasty, and enough for two people. When it came to maki time, we were totally blown away.  The spicy tataki was really well balanced with just the right amount of heat. Loving me some tobiko, we had the scary spider. We cleaned up with a Mexican roll, again well balanced and not too spicy.

Overall, the roll size was nice and packed with fish. Really fresh and tasty fish. I was quite surprised, and if I ever haunt Lemont again I&#39;ll come back to Kitaro."

Atmosphere: I loved the decor here. Very elegant and very soothing. It made my eating experience very enjoyable. And the to top it off, I love John Legend, and hearing a collection of his songs was a huge +

Service: The GF and I had Erica (or was it Ericka?) as our server and she was beyond helpful! She recommended several dishes that blew our taste buds away, and what made her even better was her attentiveness. Always a good thing in my book!

Food: Our appetizers, the super white seared tuna was out of this world! My GF never had a thing for tuna, let alone almost raw tuna, but she absolutely loved it! The tuna had very subtle taste and it was packed with this vinaigrette and pepper sauce, topped with avacado. Delicious! The King Kong Roll and Salmon Obsession maki rolls were phenomenal and a great twist on classic sushi rolls.

Price &amp; Portion: Compared to all the other sushi joints I have eaten at, this place was very reasonable with the prices and the portions were nothing to complain about! We  had our fair share of food for about $70 and it was more than enough to put me in a near state of food coma. 

Overall: I would not hesitate to come back here if they were located closer to the city to where I work! I would definitely be a regular here for lunch and dinner take-out! 5 stars! boom"

Aesthetically, Kitaro delivers.  It&#39;s cool and lounge-y looking with a modern relaxing, zen-like vibe.

The food is quite tasty and the presentation is beautiful and inventive.  Portion sizes are a little on the smaller side than I have come to expect in other sushi bars in the area (i.e. Ichiro in Orland Park and Blu Coral in Woodridge).  

What shocked me about Kitaro was the price we paid for dinner.  A dinner for four (where only three people ordered sushi and the 4th only had a seaweed salad and miso soup) without any alcoholic drinks came to $180 plus tip.

Finally, service was sub-par.  While I think this might be because our waitress was young and seemed very inexperienced, I think part of it was also due to her disinterest in actually doing her job.  The restaurant was more than 3/4 empty, yet it took close to 10 minutes to get a cup of green tea while we waited 30-40 minutes for some of our rolls to be delivered even though the plates were standing ready for 15 or more minutes.

I hope the service improves as the restaurant continues to work out its opening-month kinks; however, if service remains as it was during my visit and prices remain this high I see little chance of this establishment lasting through to year-end."

My boyfriend/soon to be fiance, family and I arrived at noon for brunch and no one was there to greet us or seat us. I had to ask another patron about what we were supposed to do, and after five minutes had passed, the PATRON had to flag down a server to find us someone. 

Turns out the hostess was hiding out in the back office even though brunch hours are clearly until 12:30 pm.

The hostess did not apologize nor did she do anything to make us feel special. She took her time in setting the table for us so that we were finally seated around 12:15 pm. Again, brunch ended at 12:30 pm.

Later on as I was taking pictures of the venue, I caught the hostess sitting at the bar in the back and not doing anything.

I have to commend the server who flagged the hostess down who treated us respectfully. He promptly refilled our waters and my coffee.

The food was not bad but I was hoping for more in light of the price. My favorite was the biscuits and gravy. Other offerings were fruit, mini muffins, pancakes, belgian waffles, hand-carved ham, made to order omelettes, bread pudding, fritattas and eggs benedict.

Overall, I am pretty crushed as this was our first choice for a venue."

red-oak-room-at-cantigny-wheaton,Pudding P.,NoGL5Pc9eHk_1NGLIfGR_g,"Dallas, TX",0,1,0,2,716,Gvzh7PHDnL8fP3tvZVp7dA,3.0,2013-12-18,"I booked this place for my wedding reception because my wife and I wanted our ceremony at Cantigny gardens (which I would give 4 stars and definitely recommend despite the constantly awol planner), and this package allowed a solid backup site for our ceremony if the weather was bad (fortunately we had good weather).

General comments:

It was a good sized venue for 100 people. Hotels near I88 in Naperville/Warrenville are not far for out-of-town guests. None of my guests used the outdoor patio even though the weather was perfect. There is plenty of parking. There is no PA system, the DJ must provide it.

The good:

Price is competitive (def not &#34;cheap,&#34; we are talking about a wedding here). It was cheaper than Morton Arboretum, which is probably its main competitor for outdoor venues in this price range. They were transparent with how 7.25% would be added to our bill for tax and 20% for gratuity.

The drinks were surprisingly good. Surprisingly because I went with the cheapest drink package, plus $2/person more for an expanded beer menu. In addition to the beer, the cocktails were tasty and the bartender was efficient and professional. I probably would have given this place two stars if it weren&#39;t for the drinks and bartender.

The chicken carbonera was also better than I expected. But perhaps my expectations were just low (see below). I was a tad upset they took my food away while I left my table to greet some guests (I wanted to finish it, dammit!)

The bad:

I was expecting a little more decor work than was provided by the planner. They provided a choice of tablecloth color (white or ivory i believe) but that was about it. A family friend (not Red Oak Room or Cantigny) did 90% of our decorating. The planner should have been more transparent about what they would or would not provide from the beginning.

Communicating with the planner was challenging and is my biggest reason for not giving a higher rating. Emails and voicemails consistently went weeks without a reply, even after multiple attempts. For example, it took more than a month for me to get my rehearsal time planned because the staff was always unavailable and would never return my calls. If I asked three questions in an email, I would get an answer to two of them with the third completely ignored. This happened multiple times - almost to the point of becoming comical. Even paying for the damn thing was a struggle which required multiple emails and calls until I was finally able to get ahold of them.

Overall, the vibe I got from the planning staff was &#34;We do this every weekend and it&#39;s always oh so awesome and we get paid for it, therefore there is no need to go above and beyond and oh yea I&#39;ll just get back to my client whenever I feel like it- their questions don&#39;t really matter because I&#39;m going to do exactly what I do every week anyway.&#34;

I&#39;m aware that this is not the Four Seasons, but still... if I&#39;m paying someone $10k I expect a minimum degree of punctuality and professionalism. The reception got &#34;taken care of&#34; in the end but the planner definitely tested my patience over the months leading up to the the big day. The logistics of choosing a date, tasting appointment, menu, guest list and basic decorations should not have been as goddamn aggravating as it was.

Despite my worries, I had an awesome time. I don&#39;t have any regrets. I&#39;m willing to concede that a little stress is an inevitable part of wedding planning, but I believe the planning staff here exceeded a reasonable level. By no means am I shouting &#34;stay away from this place,&#34; but 5 months after my wedding I believe the only value in this place for a wedding reception is it provides an inclement weather backup for a ceremony at Cantigny Gardens. In other words, had I known the weather would be perfect and that the planning process would be as annoying as it was, I would not have chosen Red Oak Room for my reception. I definitely would choose a ceremony at Rose Garden again though.

TL;DR had a wedding reception here. was a grand &#39;ol time in the end but the planning staff was super aggravating. to me the only reason to have a wedding reception here is it also provides a backup in case the weather is bad for a garden ceremony"

I took full advantage of the omelet bar, loading it with bacon, sausage, and onion. This was again, in my obese days. I also loaded up on french toast and potatoes (naturally) because I am an American and it is SO hard to say no to these things! Change your habits, change your life, people! That is my inspiration for you today!

I didn&#39;t have to pay! Expensive as hell! I&#39;d rather try Warrenville Pancake House down the road OR Red Apple Pancake House in Carol Stream, The Verdict, or Egglectic farther North in Wheaton! More bang for your buck! The views at this place were awesome...I mean, it is a golf course

At this point of my life, I was not addicted to black coffee, but if I was I bet I would have gotten one refill. This is why i hate buffet style dining. Not only the drink service is usually terrible, but did little Jimmy decide to touch every donut on the tray before he picked which type he wanted? I bet mommy let Jimmy do that because Jimmy is a spoiled brat...hahah!

If you&#39;re in the area, want to splurge, and you&#39;re not paying (ha), I&#39;d stop here. Won&#39;t go out of my way to go again!"

The setting is beautiful, with a great view of the golf course, and for $13.95, the buffet selection cant be beat.  However, service is a bit flakey and some of the food is not so good because it doesnt get turned over enough.  

Good:
Sausage
Bacon
Carved Meat (listed as ham on the placard but actually was turkey)
fruit
potatoes

Bad:
Johnny Cakes (small and dry)
Grits (congealed and tasteless)
Southern eggs benedict (had potential with the fried green tomato on it, but overall it was too dry and needed quite a bit of salt to make it palatable)

DIdnt try:
omelets (but the ones that passed by looked well made and they had a lot of ingredient choices)
French toast
Biscuits and Gravy
cereal
yogurt
baked goods
waffles

All in all a pretty good brunch for the price.  All drinks, aside from coffee, are extra."

I met with Patti, a food and drink manager who, despite not being the main event manager, was extremely knowledgeable, and helpful. She took a lot of time breaking down options, pricing, and weighing the pros and cons of each package with my mom and I. She did not seem alarmed at all when we informed her that the wedding was happening in 7 weeks - which was a welcome non reaction. I have found Cantigny to be competitively priced, and in my opinion offers a beautiful space for a wedding reception that does not feel like a reception hall - which I can&#39;t stand. I&#39;ll update as i go along, but so far so good (please don&#39;t be the kiss of death)"

I was there for the breakfast buffet with a group.  The setting is lovely - there&#39;s a beautiful view of the lake at the golf course.  

The breakfast buffet is exactly as promised on their website.  It has a little more selection than you&#39;ll get at a nice hotel - there&#39;s bread pudding and carved ham in addition to the usual cereals, fruit, biscuits/gravy, muffins, etc.  and the hash browns, while pretty flavorless, included bits of onion and other vegetable.  There&#39;s an omelet station and waffles.   The omelet station offers more choices than one would usually get - notably, sun-dried tomatoes and fresh spinach are options.  Ask for your omelet well-done - mine was underdone, with liquid egg in the middle, and so was someone else&#39;s in the group.  The baked goods appeared to include some of the same pre-made options (powdered donuts, mini-muffins) you&#39;d get at a Holiday Inn, which I found disappointing.  Of course, you can&#39;t get a Bloody Mary or mimosas at a Holiday Inn.

Price for the buffet is $13.95 plus drinks.  I got an orange juice, which was nothing remarkable.  Service was OK - it&#39;s a buffet and we were there starting at noon for a buffet which stops seating at 12:30.

For a vegetarian, unless you&#39;re here with a group, don&#39;t bother.   If the omelet station had produced a properly cooked omelet, this would be a solid three stars.  As it is, I struggled and am giving the third star for the surroundings and the view, which was truly lovely.  Might be a solid three stars if you eat meat."

The setting is beautiful. The dining hall is made up of dark wood, and there was golf memorabilia donning the walls. The restaurant overlooks a couple of holes on the Golf course. All of this leads to a really nice atmosphere for a meal. 
 I hate to say it, but the Brunch was pretty mediocre. They offered your normal brunch staples like Bacon, Sausage, Potato&#39;s and fresh fruit. All of these were ok. The Biscuit&#39;s and gravy were really bland.  I guess I spent too much time in the south and have become a biscuits and gravy snob. 
 The service was good and the setting was elegant, but they food really need to be improved. If I&#39;m ever in the area or if I play the course, I would give it a shot again. I can&#39;t really complain, $14.00 is not a lot of money to pay to get your grub on, but considering the beautiful setting, the food was disappointing."

My husband has enjoyed golfing at Cantigny, so I thought he&#39;d enjoy dining there as well. The setting was nice, and we had a table at the window overlooking the water fountain (this was worth the 1 star given).  The experience went downhill fast from there.  Immediately after being seated, a server approached and asked what we would like to drink.  I asked for just a minute to look at our options, and she turned on her heel without a smile or saying a word.  A little ruder than normal, I thought at the time.  We each decided to just have lemonade which was refilled somewhat regularly but was consistently warm.  Our plates would be taken before we were finished, along with our silverware which was never replenished - fortunately our original setting came with both a salad and dinner fork.  Service was just not friendly, and they didn&#39;t have to do anything other than occasionally refill a glass or take a partially eaten plate away.  When we received the bill that automatically added 15% gratuity - for a party of 2 (my daughter is only 1 year old and wasn&#39;t served anything), and for a buffet which apparently required no real interaction between us and the servers - we could see why they didn&#39;t need to be friendly or helpful at all.  I don&#39;t see the need to add gratuity to the bill in that situation.  Perhaps better service would have improved our overall thought of the meal.

Now for the food.  They offered three seatings for the day, and we were at the 3rd and final seating.  We were there a couple minutes early, and I had expected that the food would be fresh for each seating.  There is no way that was the case.  Everything had a sort of film over it, like what you would expect late in the afternoon at a hospital cafeteria.  The shrimp cocktail was peel and eat - and not de-veined - which was not at all what I expected at the price charged per person.  The sushi was worse than what I&#39;d find at a discount chain grocery store - seriously.  The whole thing reminded us both of a low-end Las Vegas hotel buffet.  Items that should have been cold were room temperature.  Items that should have been hot were room temperature.  Plus, there were things listed on the menu online that they must have run out of by our sitting because they were nowhere to be found.  The entire experience was such a huge disappointment.  We&#39;ve thrown away $100 before, and unfortunately probably will again, but it certainly never feels good when it happens and that&#39;s the feeling we got today after this less than mediocre dining experience."

I was really bummed until we visited Cantigny. It was absolutely beautiful and reasonably priced. We chose to have the ceremony at the park in the rose garden and the reception at the Red Oak Room at the golf course. Unfortunately, mother nature had other plans. 

We had to decide hours before the ceremony whether to move it inside due to looming rain clouds. The coordinator, Karen, was really helpful and steered us toward the right decision. We didn&#39;t have time to get everything to the patio at the Red Oak Room, but we were able to move it inside in the visitors center at the park. I had never spent much time in the visitors center and was a little concerned about what it would look like. Fortunately, it was perfect. The room was decorated very nicely and the coordinator there (Megan, who I had never met) worked tirelessly to make everything happen. We were very happy with how everything turned out. Megan was also really helpful in taking care of a crying flower girl. 

The reception was equally great. Although it was raining, we had great views of the golf course, wonderful covered patio, and a beautiful room. I probably asked Karen a million questions over the many months of planning and she was very patient and responsive. Her answer to everything was &#34;we&#39;ll make it happen.&#34; It really took a lot of stress away. I attended the once a year food tasting and wasn&#39;t very impressed. It tasted like generic wedding food. Again, Cantigny came through. The food was fantastic. We got rave reviews from the guests - everything from the soup to the 10:30pm sundae bar was a hit. I would also like to thank the staff. They were courteous, helpful, professional, and a pleasure to work with. We would also like to thank Pete the bartender for making us some seriously great margaritas for the night. 

It was the perfect location for our event and I am still very happy with our choice. I wouldn&#39;t even think twice about having another event there."

Loved the trifecta of salsa served in the bottles, as apposed to dishs. The chips must be made in-house daily and were great. 

Guacamole was decent too but the Carna Asada a la Tampiquena was super tender and perfect. It was a large portion for $12, took half home. The chips, guacamole and salsa filled me up so.

The chips and  pico de gallo that they give you when you first sit down are really good too. I definitely recommend this place if you&#39;re looking to have some good Mexican food.

Maybe even the best Mexican restaurant I&#39;ve ever been to, and as someone who has spent considerable time in Southern California, that&#39;s a pretty lofty claim, I admit.

The crux of any Mexican joint is the quality of the chips and salsa, and, well, let&#39;s use a car analogy. You know how in any movie that features a drag race portion there&#39;s always a crucial point where both cars are neck and neck then one of the driver smugly smiles before punching the nitrous and leaving his opponent in the dust? Well, that&#39;s the culinary equivalent of what happens when your waiter (or waitress) drops Panchos&#39; chips and salsa off at your table.

The chips simply must be made in house, if they&#39;re not, they&#39;re the best pre-packaged chips I&#39;ve ever had. The same goes for the salsas, of which you get an assortment of three ranging in different heat levels from a fresh pico de gallo to what I can only assume is some sort of smoky chipotle concoction. If you feel like going all out, get the guacamole, you won&#39;t be disappointed. Paired with their already amazing chips, you&#39;re in for a treat.

The food is fantastic, and everything I&#39;ve tried from the menu has been to die for- Especially the gorditas. Throw everything you know about gorditas (likely taught by Taco Bell) out the window. These are like if you took an extra thick corn tortilla, split it open to make a pita-like pocket, then filled it with taco trimmings. I&#39;ve been competing in a personal competition called the &#34;three gordita challenge,&#34; and have never been able to finish three in a single sitting.

One tip though- If you can, you really should go during what amounts to &#34;prime&#34; dining hours. As close to noon as possible for lunch, and as close to around 5:00-ish for dinner. It seems clear they make their food fresh for the day, and have been there when they&#39;ve just been out of gordita shells. The food also seems better the busier the restaurant is.

Not that it&#39;s bad or anything later in the day, but there&#39;s a noticeable difference when you roll in at 8:30, minutes before the close, versus showing up at 1:00 PM on a Saturday for lunch."

Located at a nondescript strip mall Pancho&#39;s is bringing classic Mexican dishes at a fair price with attentive service. When you sit down, you get 3 different salsas and complimentary chips, along with some chunky pico. Take this time to familiarize yourself with the salsas, these are all home made, and the red had solid heat. Pico was fresh and tasty.

My 3 taco meal had delicious rice on the side. There is clearly some lard in there, but it was so light and fluffy I did&#39;t care. The corn tortillas were very authentic and the chicken was lean, and had been marinating for a long time. This was about 7$ and I was stuffed when I finished the meal.

Ask for jalapenos, the side of jalapenos was home-made and cut in to chunky slices. Seems they pickle there own jalapenos and cut them up just for you. This took my tacos to the next level. Service was spot on, I had my drink re-filled a few times without asking. Meals are served with limes, another plus.

The atmosphere was fun and we had some live music on a Sunday. Very impressed with this place, I&#39;ll be back!"

A few weeks ago I had a DirecTV guy out at my house to adjust my satellite dish. We had both lived in Southern California so we talked at length about the great Mexican food back there. He asked if I had ever been to Pancho&#39;s in Aurora, and said it was some of the best he&#39;d ever had (given that he was born in East LA, and not lives in Aurora, I figured I could trust his judgment on the subject). Last weekend (yes, on Cinco de Mayo) we drove out to Pancho&#39;s to see if it was as good as I was told.

Oh boy, we are definitely going back. To begin with, I love a place that brings multiple salsas (and not just spicy, spicier, and spiciest versions of the same basic salsa), and all three of the salsas that this place set on the table were very good. What sealed the deal were the spot-on Queso Fundido and the fresh and tasty Guacamole. 

I had the extremely flavorful Carne Asada, my mom had the steak fajita, and my wife had the enchiladas suizas. Everything was great, and the service was nice and friendly. My only complaint was that the menu wasn&#39;t very large. That&#39;s probably a good thing though, because it allows them to focus on a smaller number of things to do really well, rather than a large number of things to do mediocre.

We arrived at noon on a Saturday and had the place to ourselves for at least half an hour, until the place was probably about 75% full. Even when we were the only ones besides two other table though, the small parking lot that this place shares with the other businesses in the strip mall was packed. It was obviously much crazier when we left, with people sitting in their cars waiting for someone to pull out of a spot."

However, I did enjoy my steak burrito.  I did appreciate the guy informing me ahead of time that their burritos were smaller compared to other places and asked if I wanted to order another one.  Hell for $3, why not?

It&#39;s a nice atmosphere, has mariachi band on Friday and Saturday nights, great food and the drinks are awesome as well. Order a beer and you get an ice chilled glass salted with salt rim thats colors of the mexican flag. Not sure why but beer always tastes so mcuh better here than at home. I&#39;d recommend trying a Victoria a mexican beer not quite as well known as the coronas and modellos and doz xx etc.

Their carne asada ala tampiquena is probably the best ive ever had anywhere. Great chips with three salsas before you eat. Staff is friendly and helpful.

If you wanna eat cheap they have burritos and tacos dinners and thing like that for cheap, however even if you wanna have a streak and a few drinks for two people will still only run you about $30.

FYI- they are closed on Mondays so go elsewhere if you have a Mexican food craving that day. The Pros: prices are fantastic. You can get a steak taco dinner for a mere 5.95, and all the free chips &amp; salsa your heart desires. Speaking of, the chips &amp; salsa there are the best. They are large, fresh, warm chips which taste homemade, and they give you three different dipping items - two different salsas &amp; a pico de gallo. Also, the guacamole is creamy and tasty. Two reasons they don&#39;t get five stars: 1) Though the staff is friendly and polite, it takes the waitresses quite a while to give you a refill, and even longer to come by and give you the check. 2) Mariachi band on the weekend is far too loud. Felt like I had to shout to have a conversation with the person I was sitting right across from. If you are not a fan, I would recommend going M-Th.

A Mexican restaurant in a highly Mexican city would have to be good if the locals were the people filling the chairs. Not being Mexican, we were in the minority here but were made to feel welcome and received excellent advice on what to order. I am told this is authentic Mexican fare but only know that is was delicious from first hand knowledge. Some restaurants balk at requests to taste things or change the menu but we were treated to whatever we desired and at very reasonable prices. The portions were generous and flavors complex. Although we were fully sated, the house-made cheesecake tempted us and delivered the best flavor in a cheesecake I have ever had. This is the place to go for special events too. There were several birthdays celebrated and it looked like a fun experience and obviously family friendly but not obnoxiously loud. If Mexican food is not liked by one of your party, they also had some American fare on the menu but they can create the food to the taste of the diner, so why not just get the specialty of the house. We will be back."

The place was busy with a non-ethnic crowd.   That brought me immediate worry as I was in search of some authentic cooking.  I ordered the ceviche.  While it tasted like ceviche, it wasn&#39;t the fresh smelling ceviche that I was used too.  The michelada (beer) was ok.  It tasted as if they quickly put it together with a can of clamato and forgot the lime, salt, and other ingredients that go in.  The carne asada was good but the sides were a bit on the cold side.  They did have entertainment, which was a nice distraction from a long wait.  Pricing was average.  I&#39;ll probably come back on a slower night and try something different, but seems like competition has really left Pancho&#39;s behind.

I went here before it was remodeled with a friend for a drink and it was fine. Nothing great but alright. 

This last weekend I took my wife here to celebrate her birthday. It took some convincing but she wanted a steak for her birthday and I wanted to try this place since I have heard some decent reviews. 

Never again! 

My wife ordered her steak medium. The waitress brought the steak out and asked her to cut into it to be sure it was cooked well. It was very gray and overcooked. The waitress asked if we wanted to send it back and did. 

A couple of minutes later the waitress and the manager come back out with the steak. The manager, rudely, proceeds to tell my wife that it is a perfect medium. The manager takes out a FLASHLIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RESTAURANT AND SHINES IT ONTO THE STEAK. I can&#39;t make this stuff up. The manager continued to try and make her case until we finally said fine. My wife regrettably ate the steak since at this point it was pretty late for the worst birthday dinner she has ever had. I feel terrible and in hindsight we should&#39;ve walked out. Lupe or Liz was our server and the manager may have been named Lucifer. I&#39;m not certain. 

I&#39;m not going to go too much more into detail because Rayme&#39;s isn&#39;t worth the time but...

30 minutes to be greeted. Twice we were told &#34;we will be right with you.&#34; 

After 40 minutes my wife had her cocktail and I was still waiting to ask questions. No waters. 

At 49 minutes we had waters and I ordered my drink. 

Our bill was well over $100 for two people and it was an awful meal. Last one we will have there. We walked away so sad and disappointed.

Much to our surprise, the food was very poor, the service was worse, and the owner needs to retire. We ordered some appetizers and most was over cooked! We sat on the bar section to eat and relax, and when our Blackhawks scored, we all celebrated with cheers!!  Once this occurred, the &#34;Owner&#34; told us that cheering/celebrating our Chicago home team(s) was prohibited.  The time was approx.9:00p, and there was only 4-top in the dining area.  We questioned the reasoning for the &#34;RULE&#34; of no cheering.... it is because Rayme&#39;s is NOT a SPORTS BAR!

We were seated right away despite having a full parking lot.  I felt the staff was very quick and attentive.  The mixed drinks were very good.  Strong but not over powering. Well priced. 

The food, however, was disappointing.  We shared the crab stuffed mushrooms appetizer.  I didn&#39;t particularly enjoy this dish.  There was barely any crab flavor.  The breading was very heavy and didn&#39;t provide a textural counterpoint to the mushrooms or stuffing.

We both ordered entrees with came with soup or salad.  We both elected for the French onion soup which was quite tasty.  The broth had a deep flavor and the bread still had a bit of crisp.  Somewhat odd was the use of mozzarella cheese as the topping. A more traditional preparation would have been preferred. 

For dinner I ordered the special of the day which was a coconut shrimp dish with pineapple dipping sauce. There were 7 regular sized shrimp on the platter. The crust was mostly fried breading with a smattering of coconut flake.  The shrimp themselves were dry, a sign of being overcooked. I&#39;m glad I paid extra for the loaded baked potato sidedish because the potato itself was not seasoned at all. Its saving grace was the baked cheddar topping which added some much needed flavor. The potato was much more filling than the rest of the meal which ended up costing $26, way too much for the portions. 

My fiancé ordered the baked scallops with a parmesean crust and Alfredo pasta side dish. She described the scallops as very clean, no grittiness, and tender.  She didn&#39;t like the crust,  it lacked the salty parmesean flavor she was looking for and was mostly breadcrumbs.  I tried a bite and promptly told her they were undercooked.  She gleefully disagreed, stating she liked them that way. By the end of dinner she hadn&#39;t finished half her plate and decided not to take the leftovers home.  She&#39;s now dealing with a severely upset stomach while I lay in bed writing this review.

Overall,  we were both very disappointed by the food. We had hoped to find an alternative date night place from our usual suspects in the area. I enjoyed the drinks and would probably return here only in that capacity."

The food is good steak and seafood with a little comfort food.  They always have tasty specials and at  least one very delicious fish on the menu.   My wife and I have been here three times since we moved to Lisle in the summer.  It&#39;s equally great for dates and families with kids.

The food was nothing special. There are so many steakhouses around, why settle for just average? I had the scallops with parmesan crust, but all I tasted were breadcrumbs. Hubby&#39;s steak was dry in my opinion. I had the seasonal vegetables side, and they were tender, but boring. The décor was boring, not cozy or romantic or fun. Sorry, but not excited to return. I need some sizzle, not The Sizzler."

It is a staple in this town and now with grandma as the built in babysitter for New Years Eve, my husband and I thought we would try it. 
 
First off, the hostess is amazing and professional and speedy quick. We were seated at our reservation time, which on New Years is great.

The warm bread was the starter and was so yummy! We started off with French onion soup which was delicious although heavy on the garlic.

Next up, our mushroom appetizer that didn&#39;t show up but came as sautéed mushrooms as the side dish with the meal. Ok, miscommunication. 

My husband ordered crab cake entree which was undercooked and no crunchy crust.

I ordered the filet which is was cooked perfectly although the veggies were bland. 

The drinks were great!!

The service was good not great, again, New Years.

I&#39;m not sure if being New Years, if this was the normal crowd but it&#39;s mostly 50-70 year olds and super, ummm...how do I say....Lacking in diversity...which is fine, I think. 

Dining room is lively and beautiful. The bar seems super nice, although a bit too bright. 

All in all for the super reasonable price point ( $30 for the filet ) it was good.
And this review is really long because we have been waiting for the dessert for about fifteen minutes. Hoping the butterscotch bread pudding is worth it."

We were shocked to walk in at 6:30pm on a Sunday night, and have them pull a table for 9 together right away. And the lot looked pretty full, so it wasn&#39;t because the place was dead.

The server was friendly and helpful, although probably spread too thin. There were times we didn&#39;t see her for a while, and the meal did not move along quickly, but the food came out hot, and all 9 meals in quick succession. And the food was very good. I Had the Mango Tilapia special, and the waitress volunteered that substitutions of a different patio or different vegetable were okay. (This was a pleasant surprise, and they have a good variety of potatoes and vegetables.)

The fish was delicious, and the smashed potatoes were good. I substituted the brussel sprouts for mixed greens. The sprouts were very tender, but not flavorful. (Boiled or steamed, not grilled.) But overall the meal was very good. My son&#39;s chicken pot pie was huge, and nobody walked away hungry."

The food was great!! Loved the Cobb Salad, Red Snapper Veracruz, green beans side, and kids were very happy with their grilled cheese, steak fries, Cole slaw and apple sauce. One of my favorite things--the lava cake with ice cream. Fried chicken was ok, creamy garlic dressing was ok. The restaurant was decorated nicely for the holidays. Definitely would go back."

Soooooooooooooo, bar area to the left upon entry, dining room to the right.  Yes, it can now accommodate more diners and you can hear it the second you walk in.  And what&#39;s with the large counter area toward the rear of the dining room.  Is that a support beam trying to be camouflaged?  As best we could tell, it served no purpose except for people to move the candle, sugar holder, salt and pepper shakers, dirty napkins, and other stuff off the small tables to make room for food.

Even yelling made it difficult to hear each other at the table.  We asked to move over one table next to the one we were shown, but we were told that was not possible.  Huh???  Yet, another table of 4 moved to another table when they did not want to sit at the table they were shown.  How does that work????  A table set for 4 was short a bread dish.  Upon request, 2 were very unceremoniously dropped on the table, no comment like, &#34;sorry about that&#34; or&#34; here you go&#34;.  When you sit, you will find the bread dishes are stacked under the bowl of butter.

Yes, the ribs still fall off the bone, but the baked potato was not hot, my husband&#39;s potato was not fully cooked, the water had an awful taste to it, service was slooooooooooow.  Our simple dinner took just over 3 hours ~ no dessert.  Our server disappeared for looooooooooong periods of time and multiple requests for things were required:  i.e. a knife, a sprite, a glass of ice water without lemon ( which is how I found out I was not able to drink the water), a glass of wine.

Yes, it has a following and maybe they get treated better."

DISREGARD the negative reviews here. This place is a hot spot for a romantic date night. 

My girlfriend and I made reservations for 8pm. We arrived 15 minutes early, and we&#39;re promptly sat by the manager, Jerri. More on how wonderful she is in a moment..

Our server, Lupe, arrived in less than 30 seconds to deliver menus, and ask for our drinks. Shortly after, fresh bread and butter arrived. The restaurant was nearly full, with a comfortable noise level. 

We ordered the Crab Stuffed Mushrooms for an appetizer. It was phenomenal. I rarely enjoy mushrooms, and these were cooked perfectly, with a delicious spread of melted cheese on top.

The french onion soup arrived before our main dishes, and they were heavenly.

I had already drained a mai tai--which had a perfect mix of alcohol to juice--before ordering a second drink. 

I&#39;ve never had a New York Strip. But the one I tasted here instantly hooked me forever. I paid the extra $2 to have bleu cheese melted on top of it. It was cooked to a perfect medium.

Throughout our dining experience, Lupe was attentive enough to handle our needs, but gave us equal privacy to enjoy a romantic date night. 

Before we left, we chatted with the manager Jerri. She took our picture for us, and told us some of the history of Rayme&#39;s. She was a wonderful little lady, and I look forward to chatting with her again. 

To say the least, this date worked in my favor for more than just delicious food and drinks ;)."

The service is in need of a major overhaul and matches a fast food restaurant. Took a while to get our first drinks and the waitress was a bit short and not very friendly. Ordered our drinks and was told it would take a while to get as the bar was backed up. Looking at the bar, the bartender was talking to people so that might have been the wait. Our order is also delayed due to a backup, there are 10 empty tables. Wonder what the wait when they are full.  Asked for a manager and was told they do not have one. All of a sudden someone showed up that was a manager. This place is a joke , unorganized and not managed in any way.  First time her and last time. 

Good luck if you venture out to this establishment."

The reason for the review is to compliment their service and quality of food. We could not have been more pleased.

I decided my friend and I would head there to try a king sized cocktail and some dinner for my 29th birthday.

It has lovely charm and a soft atmosphere. It is perfect for an intimate meal with great conversation.

The wine list, honestly, could be better for being a fish and steak place. But I wasn&#39;t there for wine anyway, I wanted a cocktail. It was amazing!

I ended up getting the Filet Medallions, Medium Well. I ended up with three medallions, one was cooked Medium Rare, one was Medium, and on was Well Done. Since I was with a friend I just ate what was on my plate and called it a day. The food was my reason for only the 3 stars. It wasn&#39;t anything I would rave about, but with a hungry tummy, it was satisfying.

We also split the Creme Brulee cheesecake. You can tell that it was definitely frozen. It was still good, but the waitress told us it was Eli&#39;s. I wish for that price we got a dessert made in house.

Next time I think I will head there just for a drink."

We arrived at 5:00 PM on a Thursday evening and the bar was 3/4 full already.  Only 4 tables were occupied in the dining room but by the time we left at 6:15, 3/4 of the dining room was filled.  We were seated at the second table along the windows and in fairly close proximity to the bar.  Yes, the folks in the bar were having a good time but we were still able to have a comfortable conversation throughout our meal.  I only mention this because noise has been a frequent complaint in other reviews.

I ordered broiled grouper with a horseradish crust ($22) and it was prepared perfectly.  The seasonings were spot on and the &#34;heat&#34; of the horseradish was not overpowering.  I had a standard dinner salad with blue cheese which was OK.  My wife ordered Gary&#39;s Special Pasta which is a medley of clams, shrimp, artichoke hearts, sun-dried tomatoes in garlic oil over cavatappi pasta ($19).  This was very good.  I sampled a couple of forkfuls and this is a really nice pasta dish full of flavor.  This pasta dish would pair nicely with a good white wine.  Unfortunately, the wine list is not up to par with the food menu.  It&#39;s a small and average selection of wines.

Cocktails on the other hand are another matter entirely.  Yes, Rayme&#39;s is STILL the home of the king sized cocktail.  (I noticed one reviewer claim that the cocktails &#34;proved to be normal in size&#34;.  If these are &#34;normal&#34; Kelli, please let me know restaurants/ bars that serve bigger cocktails.  I&#39;m serious and not being a wise guy here. :))  Prices for cocktails are reasonable as well.  Vodka Martini = $8.  Vodka &amp; Tonic = $6.  Martini&#39;s just about everywhere are $9-$10 and not as large.

I notice that the new Rayme&#39;s has received mixed reviews.  All I can say is that our first experience at the new Rayme&#39;s was excellent and we will be back soon."

I was there with a group of about 25 for my Grandma&#39;s 86th birthday.  I only know this because my mother, who lives out of state and couldn&#39;t join in the fun apparently texted to one of her siblings to wish Grandma (her mother) &#34;Happy 85th Birthday.&#34;  A good laugh was had and she was then informed that Grandma&#39;s 85th birthday was last year.  I shouldn&#39;t laugh because that&#39;s the only reason how I figured out how old she was turning.

So as our party of 25ish people slowly began to arrive, many of them immediately from the Illumination thing at the Arboretum up the street, we convened in the bar area where many family members (not me) ordered adult beverages.  

After everyone was present and accounted for, we were led to our ridiculously long table.  To everyone else in my family, this is normal.  To me, it&#39;s terrifying.  My mother is the only sibling of 7 who chose to move out of state so I&#39;m still not used to having any more than five people (my immediate family unit) at any given gathering.  Crowds freak me out and I think I suffer from social anxiety disorder when I&#39;m around my family.

So I seated myself beside the one cousin I can actually kind of carry on a normal, pleasant conversation with (the older I get, the more strangely introverted I get) and I was actually kind of directly across from my Grandma, which was nice because I was able to talk to her a bit.  

I think our reservation was for 7:00.  It was on a Sunday and I had to work an 11 hour day the following day, Monday, which I was already dreading.  Mondays at my job are very often hell (as they are for most people I guess) and especially when it&#39;s such a loooooong day.  I was glad to be there, but feared it would be a late night, which it was.  It was a very leisurely and social meal, which I expected, but I was preoccupied with the work situation which prevented me from fully enjoying the meal, and instead kept staring at the time on my phone.  

On to the food...

I ordered eggplant parmesan with cavatappi and I&#39;m guessing a caesar salad, I don&#39;t really remember.  I thought it was pretty awesome that they offered the cavatappi option.  Spaghetti is such a pain for me to eat.  

Husband ordered the boneless rib eye, we think.  We can&#39;t remember.  

Seeing as we were a huge group, I obviously couldn&#39;t see and hear what was going on everywhere, but I heard several people ask for things that were forgotten.  Side items, soups and salads, for example.  And one cousin was apparently completely forgotten about altogether.  He was just getting his food as I, and others, were finishing and I guess there was something wrong with it because his mother picked up his plate and started to talk back to the kitchen herself before catching a waitperson en route.  So his had to be made over again, or whatever the issue was had to be fixed.  I think he got a steak so perhaps it wasn&#39;t cooked the way he asked?  I think it was 9:30 before he actually ate.  Drink refills were hard to get also, though I totally pity any waiter or waittress that has to serve a table of 25 people.  Everyone seemed to be having a lovely time and I didn&#39;t hear anyone complain about anything.  

So they brought out a turtle cheesecake or something and we sang Happy Birthday to Grandma.  Then other desserts were ordered.  Me, being the crazed timekeeper, was freaking out all the while because the time was past 10:00 by this point.  We pretty much split at 10:30 and were the first people to leave.  

So Raymes was alright, but not a place I would frequent on any kind of regular basis.  Grandma seemed to have a nice birthday dinner and enjoyed the company so I guess that&#39;s the most important thing."

After being out for - what, nearly a year? - rebuilding because of flood damage, I find that Raymes has lost its charm for me. The new building is beautifully done, the parking is accessible and mindfully designed, the new outdoor seating is really nice. The tables inside are ridiculous. I&#39;m a tall person and can&#39;t sit without having to jam my knee into a bar underneath, no matter what side I sit on. Someone overlooked this when selecting these. It also feels very crowded in the dining area, and there&#39;s no way to reduce the noise level when it gets loud.

The menu is essentially classic Americana. Basically the same from the original restaurant and, after a summer of figuring out their kitchen, things seem to have hit some consistency with how it&#39;s prepared and come out (I&#39;ve been here several times over the summer - it&#39;s a family favorite). That said, I find the time it takes for entrees to be served to be tediously long. I&#39;ve found that some dishes are fairly consistently dry or overcooked. The ribs are always good. They do a fair job with their pastas. But for the price, I really have always wanted better - and with the more upscale interior, I feel as if I can go to another restaurant with a similar ambiance and prices, and get better food. 

It&#39;s disappointing. I grew up coming here with my grandfather, and have such fond memories of Raymes, but I&#39;m just not a fan."

The atmosphere was decidedly semi-formal. White table clothes and a real votive candle on every table.  Larger, &#39;wedding style&#39; candles adorned the window sills.  There wasn&#39;t any music playing, but overall Raymes had a unique ambiance. 

Raymes had several well priced specials the night I dined.  Known for their &#34;giant cocktails&#34; the drink menu consisted of several wines and over-sized martinis.

Our waitress, Jordan, was polite and attentive.  There were also several other wait staff bustling around, making sure our bread basket and drinks were full, and that used plates and utensils were quickly removed from our table.

Raymes also offered a seated bar area, with Sporting events playing on televisions.   This area was separate from the dining room, and did not in any way interfere with our dining experience.  I would definitely recommend Raymes for a romantic date night, or drinks with friends."

They didn&#39;t charge for the prime rib because it was so bad, I couldn&#39;t eat it. I didn&#39;t order anything else because the aftertaste spoiled my appetite."

Rayme&#39;s before the flood was like a time capsule.  A restaurant that focused more on the quality of the food and drink than the art on the wall or a fancy wine list.

The French dip was my favorite anywhere (A+)
Oysters Rockefeller (A+++)
Pot roast (A++)
Cole slaw (A+++)
Drinks (KING SIZED!!!!)

I hope they reopen, not so much for me, because I have my memories, but for those that haven&#39;t experienced old school quality like Rayme&#39;s!!"

The only dish our table enjoyed was the open faced pot roast sandwich. That was pretty decent. Everything else was basically cafeteria food. The mashed potatoes, meatloaf, Brussels sprouts, corn was a flashback to junior high days. Even the steak was pretty lifeless. Would come here for drinks, but stay away from the food."

One of the best dinners I&#39;ve had anywhere in a long time.  From the time we walked in to the time we left there was not one thing that wasn&#39;t just right!  A warm, friendly greeting, a great seat by the window and a fantastic meal.  The Cherry Cake martini was great, I&#39;ve just discovered martinis this past year and I&#39;m enjoying working my way thru all the variations.  This one was great, I could feel the alcohol after a couple sips.  The onion soup was great, a very rich broth with the right amount of onions, crouton and cheese.  The parmesan crusted grouper was excellent....yes I said EXCELLENT.  Cooked perfectly, the parmesan crust gave it a buttery, nutty flavor.  Key lime pie for dessert to top it all off.  Brian took great care of us, he paced the meal perfectly, made sure everything was in order without hovering.  This is a place I&#39;m looking forward to returning to, soon!"

The french fries were lukewarm and the coleslaw lacked taste.

Service was good, I had the Rib Eye with the oven brown potatoes and black bean soup. My friend had the catfish, french onion soup, Brussels sprouts. 
Steak, ok, far from great, soup as good as ever, potatoes sad. My friend said the catfish was ok, soup good, sprouts fair.

Fast forward to the present day.  Rayme&#39;s has been completely rebuilt from the ground up!  The restaurant itself looks lovely now, compared to before.  Once inside, however, the food is very similar to how it was before...average.  This place is definitely not bad, but it&#39;s also not the best either.

However, we had not been to Rayme&#39;s for several years before the flood due to a bad experience.  However, we have been very excited to see the new building going up and have been very happy to see its parking lot full almost every evening and were very much looking forward to trying the new spot out.

Having read the reviews ahead of time, we went in there not expecting a lot.  It was noisy, but not as bad as some of the reviews made it out to be.  It was busy, and the lot was full and we had to park up the block.  But not a big deal.  We had a 6:30pm reservation, and we were not seated until 6:50.  But it did give us time to sit at the beautiful bar and have a cocktail, which was good (though I would not have said great)

The food was OK.  I was &#34;safe&#34; and took the ribs, something they are known for and I had loved them in the past.  They were good as usual; fall off the bone with a nicely sweet bbq sauce.  My husband had the prime rib, which made me nervous because that&#39;s what was a disaster the time we had a bad experience years ago, but it was OK.  It had been grilled to warm it up, there were grill marks on both sides, but it was done to medium rare as requested.

What was very BAD however, was the wine order.  We are red wine people and the list of wine options was very poor.  However we selected one that we thought we could get by with.  The server brought the bottle to the table already opened!  My husband was very upset with this.  So upset that he did not notice that she also brought the wrong wine as well.  We complained to the server about the bottle being opened before being brought to the table and she had the owner come over.  The owner apologized for the error but she used the word &#34;snooty&#34; saying that she didn&#39;t want the place to be so snooty as to require the bottles being opened at table side.  She used the word at least twice, leaving us feeling like she was calling us snooty for complaining about it.  She did promise to work on it, but it would take a while to teach all the servers to open the bottles (REALLY??) 

The place is beautiful, but we will not rush to go back
Just call us Snooty in Lisle"

It seems to me they created a nice looking restaurant without putting anything into what&#39;s the most important part of their business.

It was very loud but with the new opening I am sure that will ease some. The bar was full and the game was on but that didn&#39;t show in the formal dining area.

Both of the times I was there I sat at the bar with a few other people and ordered martinis. The pear berry martini is excellent; but the grey goose martini (extra dirty with bleu cheese stuffed olives) is quite possibly the absolute BEST martini I have ever had. Exceptionally smooth, made just perfect, and poured right up to the rim of my glass. Lynn, the bartender, is one of the nicest bartenders I&#39;ve ever come across in a restaurant. 
I ordered the catfish dinner (fried). It was out of this world. The catfish was cooked to perfection and melted in my mouth. The asparagus was delicious as well.
I was never a patron of this restaurant/bar before the flood. I live within walking distance and would always choose somewhere else as the atmosphere was old and stale. Now, with the redesign, I will spend a lot more time enjoying those wonderfully made martinis from Lynn. I love it here!"

I was at the restaurant tonight with some friends...just sat in the bar.  My feeling was that bar waitress was unfriendly and annoyed with our group. Appetizers-calamari and coconut shrimp, BAD.  At 9:15pm, a few people,in our group wanted  to  order a beer.  Nope, no can do.... Restaurant closes at. 9pm.  Really?  We went to Country House who welcomes customers.

Called and made a reservation, and went for dinner on Sunday....

Place looks great on the outside, looks great on the inside, layout is open., and then...  dinner was served....

Owner Jerri is also the hostess - so when she&#39;s away chatting - the podium is left empty.
We got seated - and our server finally came over.
Here are a couple of observations - Service, Food, Layout...

Service - took awhile for server to appear &amp; take our drink order - she was not busy. 15 mins later - after saying she had to &#34;re-order&#34; our drinks, they appear - 15 mins.   BTW - don&#39;t know the timing or initial food items - but we didn&#39;t get a bread basket until almost done with dinner.... as some other server, just walked by and placed on table.  We hardly saw our server, not in the dining room - so where was she ?

Food - I ordered Filet Medallions, salad, &amp; baked potato, wife had Pork slices, and same salad.  The salad was cutup iceburg lettuce, one grape tomato, croutons, and red onion.
If that&#39;s what you like for a salad - with nothing else, like carrot, cuc, etc - fine.
The medallions came out on a small metal plate inside a large plate.  They usually do this because the metal plate is usually sizzling - this one was lukewarm.
Therefore the medallions were lukewarm - in fact the entire meal was lukewarm.
The baked potato would not even melt the small packet of butter, that&#39;s how lukewarm it was.   The pork slices are of course &#34;white&#34;, serverd with/over slices of white bread, with white saurkraut and white gravy on a white plate.   
Suggestion - mix it up so the plate &#34;looks&#34; interesting and appealing - vs just big white blob of stuff.

SO - everything was lukewarm, server was MIA until check time - nothing really mentioned about dessert or .....   and it was very loud inside - all solid walls.
ok - it&#39;s 1st week - but not so good -"

Since we have always been happy here we decided it might be a good place to have my granddaughter&#39;s high school graduation party. Boy were we right!  We met with Geri one of the owners who could not have been more accommodating. She helped us lay out a menu with 3 entree&#39;s for our guests to choose from and even made our soup choice the soup of the day. On the day of the party the service was exceptional.

We did not leave the restaurant until after 8:30, it took over an hour for our food to come out of the kitchen and our drinks remained empty throughout most of our meal. Once we finally received our food we were again disappointed.  The asparagus and Brussels sprouts were boiled and had no seasoning, the walleye was overcooked and not properly cut with many bones, the filet was overcooked and also had no seasoning. The manager apologized for the fish that was overcooked but tried to explain that it was not their fault it had bones it was the fault of the fish. This is supposed to be a restaurant that specializes in steak and seafood...their chefs should know how to properly filet a fish.  We will not return to Raymes."

We were able to order half sandwiches with a cup of soup.  I got the reuben with cup of clam bisque.  The food was fresh and delicious.

The owner came by to help deliver our cocktails, and chatted with my coworker.  The service was pretty good, and we got back to the office pretty quickly.  All in all, we had a great time.

So, I really didn&#39;t know the old Rayme&#39;s was anything other than a bar.  Then there was a flood and at some point they rebuilt and I thought &#34;Boy, that looks like a restaurant where it didn&#39;t before,&#34; looked online and saw a promising looking menu.  So, last wednesday, I go by at like 4:30ish on the bus and think that we have nothing planned for dinner.  Get home at 5ish, suggest this place, We get there at like 5:15, the parking lot is packed, not a spot in the place.  I figure it&#39;s already too crowded to go there, and it&#39;s not worth trying at that point.  That crowded on a wednesday, it must be pretty good! So, flash forward to sunday, it&#39;s like 4pm, we&#39;re all talking about how we could go for an early dinner, we figure let&#39;s see how it is.  Respectably crowded, but I can park. I get inside and the restaurant is somewhat sparse and the bar is pretty packed.  My wife who is kind of an aspiring vegetarian (though she&#39;ll still have fish) sees &#34;STEAKS - SEAFOOD - RIBS&#34; and gets a bit skittish.  Looks at the menus some and we&#39;re both pleasantly surprised with a lot of tasty sounding things.  

&#34;I really like this place so far, I hope it doesn&#39;t turn out to be bad,&#34; my wife says.

So, I had steaks and ribs other times in the weekend, I was thinking seafood.  I went with scallops with sides of a french onion soup and a some green beans in a tomato sauce.  My wife got sauteed bluegill and the house salad and some spaghetti with marinara.  So, I love scallops, but it does tend to be a letdown in portion size many places.  This place beat my low expectations by serving me 4 scallops total.  And kind of boring, even though I chose scampi-style, which I&#39;ve thought of as kind of a flavorful style.  My wife&#39;s bluegill seemed more like fried instead of sauteed, but they insisted on it being sauteed.    It, too, was kind of bland.  My wife was really annoyed, because she was underwhelmed by her salad earlier.  They come by and ask how it is and we&#39;re like &#34;I think we got the fried fish instead,&#34; and they&#39;re like &#34;No, that&#39;s sauteed.&#34;  And they&#39;re like &#34;We could have it broiled for you if you like, I can find out how long it&#39;d take?&#34;  And my wife said no, because we have a toddler and he was already getting kind of antsy.  Later on, while I was waiting for the check , and the managerial-seeming lady asked me how things were, I noted that it really seemed like it was fried, and she said &#34;you have to put a little flour in there otherwise it turns out icky,&#34; and I was like &#34;Eh, okay.&#34;  Then I get home and I&#39;m looking, and a lot of sauteed fish recipes I&#39;m seeing don&#39;t do flour at all, but it&#39;s not unheard of.    I do wonder a bit what the fried fish ends up like though.  

So, back when I lived in Des Plaines there was a restaurant, Via Roma, that always seemed to have a pretty good crowd and I&#39;d eat there and be like &#34;This is really average at best, I don&#39;t see why people go there, the food isn&#39;t so good.&#34;  I&#39;m kind of getting a similar vibe from this. However, it must be said I didn&#39;t try an cocktails or a steak, kind of two of their big selling points, so I figure another trip at some point, but I figure if they&#39;re this crowded without the food being so great, it may not improve either."

Stopped in for lunch today and it was okay. We have been there about a dozen times in the last 6 years. The prices have gone up quite a bit since i was there last. $9 for a burger during lunch seems high to me. Especially since another place in Lisle has 1/2 price lunches.

The relish/salad bar is gone, but the rest remains much like I remembered. Dark paneling, carpeted floors and a bathroom with 100 coats of paint caked on the walls, doors and exposed pipes.

Looks aside, the food was real good. We had a seafood sampler for an appetizer. It was rather small but it was tasty.  The prime rib was out of this world. Perfectly seasoned and roasted to medium rare. Ill be going back just for that.

The only thing was that the service was rather on the slow side. It took about 2 hours to order and receive everything, without dessert. I only saw three waitresses in the place and every table was full. This was on a weeknight too.

The food was enough to bring me back again."

Within 5 minutes of us sitting at the bar for a cocktail to wait for the rest of our party, one of the owners was already talking to us, asking if we had questions, and making recommendations. The other owner stopped by our table a few times throughout our dinner to check in and make sure we are happy. Love it.

The bartender was sweet, and the drinks were good. The cherry cake martini may be my new favorite. At $8.50 it was super reasonably priced too. Our waitress was snarky but fun, a good match for our group. We felt taken care of.

The food itself was good - my steak was perfectly cooked, as was my potato. Mom totally enjoyed the oysters rockefeller. Though her prime rib cut was thinner than expected, the flavor was great. And the ribs are super duper good. I thought the prices were totally in line too. 

As for the decor.... it&#39;s exactly what I hoped it was going to be. I WANTED a place that looked like the supper clubs my folks used to drag me to when I was a kid. The wood paneling was comforting. It was clean, which is more important to me than being modern. My biggest critique is the bathroom was tiny, but it was clean as well. 

We were thanked by the owner when we left. This so rarely happens. It&#39;s good to know there are still honest to goodness family owned establishments out there. I would be thrilled to go back."

I took the plunge on a Saturday night in late October around Halloween.  Nice quaint place, friendly staff.  I did not have a drink since I am a craft beer snob and they did not offer anything remotely interesting, but I do understand it is a &#34;cocktail&#34; sort of place and not a beer haven.  I wasn&#39;t in the mood for an expensive steak or dinner so I opted for the butt steak burger.  It was tasty, I&#39;m just disappointed in the size of the meal for the price.  even still after paying $15.00 for a plate of food I was hoping to leave full but that was not the case.

I assumed they would have a few kinks to work out but it was really bad. Start to finish everything about it was bad. Cold soup, the medium well steak came and it was that deep uncooked purple color, had to go to the bar for ice to cool my drink, nobody to bring water, bad timing on appetizers, soup, salad, etc. Had a reservation for 7:00 and were promptly seated but the main course didn&#39;t arrive until 8:45. Every table around us had problems and that&#39;s all people were talking about. I&#39;ll be back as they have the best rib eye anywhere but honestly it was a terrible experience. They opened too early. I&#39;m sure it will get better but I would have thought the owners would have come around and said something. To top if off the waitress asked if I would like a dessert for free for the problems so I ordered a carrot cake to go. I got home and found out I was given chocolate cake instead. I&#39;m sure all this will get better but the only lasting problem I see is it&#39;s really loud in there.  it&#39;s one square room with four walls and the minute you open the door the sound hits you like a sports bar. Again....the best $25.00 rib eye you can find. ( if they cook it right )"

We were really looking forward to welcoming Rayme&#39;s back to the neighborhood, as we live within walking distance and were excited at the prospect of a great, neighborhood local place we could enjoy regularly.  We had a reservation for 5pm on a Sunday.  We were seated quickly and ordered drinks, which arrived promptly.  We put in an order for an appetizer and our meals, and then... waited.  We waited over 45 minutes for our appetizer of mozzarella sticks to arrive.  When they came, I grabbed a mozzarella stick that happened to have no cheese in it, and we agreed that they must have been frozen.  They were absolutely nothing special, considering they took 45 minutes to prepare.  Our entrées arrived perhaps 10 minutes later.  The 4 of us each ordered a different meal, and each of us was disappointed.  My husband ordered the open faced meatloaf sandwich, and was presented with the meatloaf.  His side of Brussels sprouts had not been seasoned.  My sister ordered a cavatappi pasta with meatballs, and felt her noodles were overcooked, sauce was bland and meatballs seemed frozen from a store.  Her boyfriend ordered the tilapia and felt it had &#34;no seasoning; I could have made this better at home.&#34;. First, he actually ordered the red snapper meal, but was told they were out of that (at 5pm on a Sunday?!).  We were not told of any dishes that were unavailable at the beginning of our service.  I ordered spaghetti and meatballs with marinara sauce--how hard could that be?  My noodles were overcooked, marinara had no seasoning or taste, I agreed with my sister that the meatballs were bland, but also had an unusual texture.  Worse, though, in addition to the mozzarella stick that wasn&#39;t, my spaghetti had a stray noodle and a random piece of potato that must have been at least an inch in diameter.  I don&#39;t know where the potato came from, but it really made me question how my dish was prepared and with what type of attention.  When we mentioned to our waitress that we weren&#39;t enjoying our dishes, she first thought we were joking, then gave a half hearted apology.  We were then approached by another woman (manager?  Hostess?  Not sure as she didn&#39;t introduce herself), and mentioned that we were not happy with our dishes.  She apologized, and said, &#34;We have an Italian girl in the kitchen, you didn&#39;t like your sauce?!&#34; Then we sat and waited for our check, because we were basically ignored after that.  When we did get our check, our waitress said, &#34;Please come back, we&#39;ll get better.&#34;. Walking out, the manager/hostess said, &#34;I&#39;m sorry you had a poor experience.&#34;. We were not offered to select another dish, we were not offered to have any portion of our meal comped, we were not offered anything but half hearted apologies and disbelief that we did not enjoy ourselves.  To be perfectly fair, I&#39;m sure that opening a restaurant after such a long hiatus must be difficult, and because my grandmother likes Rayme&#39;s, we may in fact try it again.  But we paid $125+ for our meals and left incredibly disappointed.  A poor meal, and a poor service.  It was most definitely not worth the money, and not worth the wait.  Had the food been good after our 45 minute wait, it would have not been a problem.  In truth, I was more insulted by the lack of concern for our experience than I was the quality of the food."

When we walked in, he took one look at the place and asked, &#34;Do you really want to eat here?&#34; I assured him that it would be okay and we thoroughly enjoyed our meal even though my husband considered the place a real &#34;dive&#34; We noticed that they had gone through some remodeling and decided to try the restaurant again.  It&#39;s been upgraded considerably as far as the building goes to include not only a bar but a full fledged restaurant. The quality of the food hasn&#39;t changed one bit--it&#39;s still pretty excellent. On your first visit I recommend the pot roast that is fall apart tender and filling! But they also have seafood, steaks etc., with a full menu that includes appetizers, salads, soups, main dishes and deserts. My only gripe is that now that it&#39;s so vastly improved in atmosphere, it&#39;s sooo busy that its hard to get a table and you have a wait for someone to take your order. Maybe the tide of patrons well slow down a little over time but my husband and I waited nearly ten minutes for someone to take our drink orders.  My next beef is the place has been taken over by the commuter crowd. You know who I&#39;m talking about--the yuppies who park at the Lisle train station and go downtown to uppity jobs in the city.  I hope Rayme&#39;s can maintain it&#39;s &#34;neighborhood joint&#34; rep by keeping the great menu and quality of the meals it serves. Even though the sign out front says this place was established in 1974, I remember it being there a lot longer than that--perhaps previous owners.  I also hope it remains because one of the reasons I love this place is that it is family owned and operated. That&#39;s why I gave it four stars!"

I am not too far, but not close enough that it is a regular thought.  I stopped in today.  It was the first time I had been there since the opening of the new building.  A lot of the quirky old school roadhouse supper club cocktail bar was missing, but it looks like a lot of the old (take that for what you want it to mean) staff were present.  It seems like the regulars at the bar are the same guys that were there when I was a kid!  I met my Father for lunch, and I will the the place was busy (lunch on a Wednesday) but if I had to guess the average age of the patrons, I would guess 68.7 years old.  Food was good, just as I remembered.  Lots of old school comfort food dishes like pot pie, chicken dishes and pot roast.  Luckily there will always be a place for that kind of food and for this kind of place.  I am glad they had the cajones to rebuild after the flood.  Welcome back, I missed you.  Every time I go there I always say i should put this place in &#34;regular rotation&#34; but never do.  Maybe this time!"

I was here for dinner wit my father and husband and we had heard that the ribs were good - but they weren&#39;t just good, they were GREAT!  The meat falls right off the bone it&#39;s so tender.  The owner Jerri said that they&#39;re cooked four times before they&#39;re served.  Awesome!  For a half slab it was $16 (I think) and a full slab was $20 and both you get a dinner side and either soup, salad or something else along those lines.  I had coleslaw as one of my sides and that was very tasty too - a little sweet and not super mayonnaise-y.  I give that two thumbs up as well.   

Overall the atmosphere is like your favorite bar if you lived in Wisconsin.  Everybody seems to know each other and the servers are nice and friendly.  It&#39;s a great laid back place to enjoy a couple big drinks and some tasty ribs.  Wish I could review more of the food, but I&#39;ll probably never try anything else since I&#39;ve had the ribs!"

It&#39;s local to where I live, and on a Friday night after work the drinks were perfect- strong, smooth, and great price.  I had a Dragontini, which tasted a lot like pop rocks, a Cherry Cake martini, and the majority of my husband&#39;s classic gin martini.  Perfect... took my mind off the stressful week I had.  

The calamari was a little different, not made of rings, but rather thick cubes made from calamari steak.  They were good- not fishy or chewy.  The sauce  accompanying it provided a good contrast. 

We ordered off of the American classic section on the menu for our main course and had meatloaf and chicken pot pie.  YUM! You could tell it was freshly made and both were comforting to have on a Friday night.  The salad before dinner was okay.  Soup was fresh (clam chowder).  And for dessert we had Turtle cheesecake and coffee to sober up for the drive home.  We even got complementary after dinner drinks from the owner for being there for our first time. 

Yes, it was a somewhat loud- lots of people, older crowd, definitely a lot of locals.  Also, the decor was very 1970&#39;s and &#34;Wisconsin&#34;-esque.  But who cares!   The service was excellent.

shrimp bisque - tiny cheap shrimps they sell in frozen department, 
side salad consisting of limp old lettuce and few slices of red onions
bread was warm but it tasted like cheap crackers
linguine with clams - so bland and greasy
ribs - what kind of bbq sauce is that?  gross.  it fell off the bone but somehow was still very dry.
Service...well, it was horrendously terrible but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s usually like that so I won&#39;t judge it by this one incident.

Little has changed in decades, so if you&#39;re looking for trendy, this ain&#39;t it.  The only trendy thing here is the standard &#34;-tini&#34; menu, but the choices are all good.  The Pear Berry martini is best in show-- it&#39;s actually like biting into a fresh, ripe pear.  Dinners run toward comfort food and retro choices, and most items are usually delicious.  The prime rib dinners are quite good, but the meatloaf, for my taste, tends to favor green peppers.  Sides run from traditional (they&#39;re famous for their cole slaw) to the unusual (Brussels sprouts).  I don&#39;t remember having dessert here because portions are always so filling.  The waitresses are prompt and chipper.  The place is friendly but can be a little crowded and noisy at times.

The decor, however, is retro in a not-so-appealing-but-not-unbearable way.  I&#39;m talking about low drop-ceilings and wood paneling on the walls.  Oddly, if you go to Rayme&#39;s for lunch on a week day, you will not find an open seat at the bar but the dining room will be empty.

Time of my visit: Lunch hours

This was my first visit here.  I decided to try it based on all the marvelous Yelp! reviews.

It is kind of tucked away off of Lake street, the street you suppose to turn on does not have a light.

It was smaller than I anticipated, three tables, counter and a cash register with nice blackboard type menus hanging on the wall.  Had a bit of a euro feel to it.

A nice lady came out and greeted me and asked me what I wanted.  I asked for a recommendation and she suggested I get Italian Sub.  My only concern was it had spicy capicollo, due to my ignorance I did not know if it was more of flavorful or hot, turned out to be flavorful.  I took a 10&#34; sub and placed my self at the table.

It did not take long for it to come out.  I was impressed by how quickly they made my sandwich.  It looked really thick!  They did not skim on the meat!  Plus - number one!  I took a first bit and was mesmerized by the bread, it was soft, but firm enough where it was not falling apart, plus - number two.  The meats and cheeses tasted fresh, juicy and high quality!

Even though I thought the price was a bit high, but it was definitely worth it!  A+!  I will come back again!"

The bread was nice and warm, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside! I could tell it was recently baked. The Pesto spread complemented the turkey like the sun complements the day! I also added giardinara peppers and that was the kicker! Will be back if I&#39;m around the area."

Awesome flavors. Perfect combination of condiments. Everything was nice and fresh. The large was big enough to comfortably split over 2 days. The only drawback is that the bread was a little to stiff for me, which in my opinion pushes out the contents when I bite into the sandwich. I like my bread soft but still a little firm.

However, I can definitely see myself returning here. Maybe next time, I&#39;ll request my bread a little softer."

It is probably one of the best Italian subs I have ever had. The bread they use alone is delicious. It has the perfectly baked crust on the outside, with hints of butter and salt. The balsamic drizzle on the soft yet slightly chewy interior is a great compliment. The meat and cheese tastes fresh. If I had an Italian grandmother make me a sandwich, I imagine this is what it would taste like. It comforts you and makes you forget all your troubles!"

It&#39;s pretty small inside, but luckily enough we were the only ones there at the time. A majority of the guys got the Italian sandwich, one got a meatball sandwich and I got the caprese. I can&#39;t fully speak for the other people, but I heard no complaints and it seemed like everyone thoroughly enjoyed their lunches!!! I got the 6&#34; caprese since I didn&#39;t want to be too full (everyone else got the bigger sandwich size and ended up bringing some home). My sandwich was great! Everything tasted so fresh and the bread had the perfect soft interior with a little crunch on the outside. The oil and basil mix added a crisp flavor that really kicked it up. After lunch, one of the guys had gotten some of the soft lemon cookies and shared them. They were so soft!! They didn&#39;t crumble in your hands, but right when they hit the inside of your mouth the whole cookie would just melt in your mouth. What a delightful end to lunch!"

Was in the mood for a good sub and as we all know it&#39;s the bead that makes for a good, tasty sandwich. This place didn&#39;t disappoint!! Even with them giving us Veggie Subs instead of the Fried Chicken we ordered it was still amazing!! Don&#39;t believe me... Well there&#39;s a reason I finished mine and didn&#39;t change it and when my nephew told them they corrected it in seconds and you can see the look on his face right before he tore into it!!

Great lil cafe with awesome FRESH FLAVORS!! Give&#39;em a try... I know we&#39;ll be back!!

UPDATE!! They wouldn&#39;t let me pay?!? We finished their delicious works of art but since it wasn&#39;t what we ordered they were adamant not to accept payment... WHO DOES THAT!?! A family owned restaurant who&#39;s been in business for over a decade!! Love these guys &amp; gals!! :)"

I legit drove passed this place three times and turned into two parking lots before I pulled into the right one. Whoops!! Anyhoo, we came here all the way from Elgin to grab some lunchy poo and although pasta and more pasta sounded like my kinda lunch I played it safe with a turkey sandwich and my friend tried their Italian beef because some other yelpers claimed it was better than Johnnie&#39;s Beef. 

When I say &#34;played it safe&#34; I really did not expect this glorious sandwich placed in front of me. It was huge and came on this great foccacia bread with olive oil, GOOD balsamic vinegar and a little mayo with shredded lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, and turkey. All the ingredients in between are important but let me tell you my fellow yelpers the foccacia bread they served this sandwich on is THE TRUTH. My friend said their beef was next level but he liked mine way better, which I agreed because previously stated that sandwich is THE TRUTH. I mean this sandwich was so good we drove an hour and thirty minutes the next day from the city to come back to roselle to get this unforgettable sandwich.

On our trip back we spoke to a gentleman who happened to be Mario (yes, the sandwich is named after him ) he told us they go to three different farmers markets every week to get fresh food. He took the time to make small talk and you know what I appreciate that. I enjoyed talking with him and of course I had to give him feedback on how awesome that sandwich is and how we drove back all that way for this sandwich. We ordered their pasta salad, pepperoni pizza, vegetable pizza, and lemon cookies and they were all phenomenal. Before we left, Mario threw in some free peanut butter brownies which probably went straight to the butt but hey real men should like that anyways right !? ;) 

Elena&#39;s is a hidden gem but I don&#39;t want it to be hidden. I want their business to do well, which telling by their postcards on their wall they looking like they are doing just fine. I hope people see this review and come to try out their food and enjoy it as much as I did."

I don&#39;t know what kind of voodoo magic Elena uses to make everything in that place so delicious, but the bread there is freshly made and is TO DIE FOR, the sandwich meats and veggies are so fresh and seasoned/cooked perfectly that I will actually eat them, and the sauces/oils/etc that end up on there make the whole sandwich just perfect.

It&#39;s primarily a catering operation, however if you knock on the door three times in the correct sequence, they just might let you in for lunch. That&#39;s what happened to me.

Elena&#39;s is a family operation and they have fun with it  No one is in a hurry here...so be patient and follow my lead.

My advise to you, whatever you order, get the biggest portion possible. I order for carryout only because seating is limited, but I&#39;m sure your sandwich will taste just as good standing up as opposed to sitting down.

This is a professional Deli that operates with confidence. No bullshit, they just make it happen.

Order extra because everything tastes better the second day!"

It&#39;s almost a unfair to review Elena&#39;s Deli as a lunch spot when 1.) it&#39;s clearly focused on being good at the catering side of the business, which means what you&#39;re served tends to come out of what they&#39;ve made to cater, and 2.) if you do stop by for lunch, you&#39;re probably going to have to take it up.

But we had a place to sit. And the food was awesome.

My wife had a prosciutto and bocconcini sandwich, which is topped with balsamic vinegar, some parmesan and fresh tomatoes. Bocconcini, it turns out, is not broccolini: it&#39;s actually a very soft, moist, tangy mozzarella cheese. On top of perfectly cured, savory prosciutto. With a deep, richly flavored balsamic permeating the sandwich bread. I liked this sandwich better, and it wasn&#39;t even my sandwich--which is a rare feat.

Not to say my meatball sub wasn&#39;t good. On the contrary; it&#39;s the best meatball sub I&#39;ve ever had. The meatballs were perfectly made; tender, with clearly identifiable parmesan notes. The tomato sauce was chunky, fresh and excellent, and there was a layer of parmesan underneath.

Both sandwiches were served with a bag of Jay&#39;s chips, which I appreciated.

Elena&#39;s Deli may very well be the best deli on Lake Street in the whole state."

HUGE portions, QUALITY sandwiches, and CHEAP. These sandwiches can last two meals and the ingredients are top notch. And they&#39;re only around 7 dollars with a bag of lays chips. More than anything anyone can ask for. So, I called in to place an order for take out and I recommend doing that since it takes them around 15-20 minutes to make sandwiches. Parking is a bit tricky, you need to turn in on the side street and go in to the parking lot but maneuver around the mall. However, well worth the sacrifices.

I ordered a large eggplant Parmesan sandwich and a large Mario sandwich and both were phenomenal. I had half of each and my taste buds are well treated. The various meats in the Mario sandwich were high quality and thinly sliced. There were some onions, tomato, and I really like the sauce they used although I can&#39;t tell what it is. The eggplant is perfectly cooked, silky and smooth, and it&#39;s paired with the best crust, sauce, and cheese. The bread they use is to die for. It&#39;s chewy and a bit tougher but all to the perfect amounts.

I&#39;m going to have to try their catering sometime. Definitely give this place a try!"

It is in sort of a strange complex that you have to drive around the back of it to get to it.
 Small place inside. I was the only one there at the time. I ordered an Italian Sub sandwich to go. Waited just a few minutes before it was ready.
Now this review is for the sandwich only, I did not try anything else. The sandwich did come on some excellent crusty bread. I really like excellent crusty bread so that is a plus. It had all of the standard Italian meats along with a bit of shredded lettuce and dressing. No tomato. I like tomatoes on my sub so thar was a little disappointing. Not sure if it was omitted or if that is the way they serve them. I thought the sub was pretty good. Was it the best I&#39;ve ever had? Nope, but it was a solid version that I would order again.
  I will return to try other items like the Italian Beef.

Cheers to All

PS: I need to point out that there was a tomato slice on my sandwich as pointed out by a sharp eyed yelper.
I did not notice it when I looked at one half. Oops on my part."

I don&#39;t care if you don&#39;t like lemon or have an aversion to citrus - her lemon cookies are beyond. Beyond delicious. Fragrant. Perfectly dressed with just the right amount of sweet frosted topping. Soft in the middle, but substantial elsewhere. If I haven&#39;t convinced you to score a lemon cookie, I might as well retired my Macbook right now. Get yourself a lemon cookie.

And yes, Elena&#39;s has all sorts of tasty morsels beyond the aforementioned glorious lemon cookies. She has foccacia, soups, salads, fried zucchini, stuffed peppers, soups, and plenty more. My fam and I stopped in to this teeny Italian deli to grab a few pre-made items for an easy Sunday dinner and here&#39;s how it went down...

Foccacia: 5/5: Flavorful hunk of delicious bread roasted and toasted with delightful toppings like hunks of cheese, roasted tomato, basil and more. 

Pasta fagioli: 4/5: A classic Italian soup made with tons of starch (lots of noodles, beans, bits of ham). Elena&#39;s is good but a little too starchy for me - we had to thin it out quite a bit and add plenty of red pepper to liven it up. 

Stuffed peppers: 4.5/5: Nicely put together and a bit spicy! 

Spaghetti squash: 5/5: These squash bakes were a huge hit with me and my 2 year old. Tons of flavor and the right amount of crisp! 

Cannolis: 4.5/5: Even at the end of the day you can still get a delicious cannoli, albeit frozen. Cannolis should be either freshly piped or frozen to ensure a fresh experience! No one wants a sad, soggy cannoli shell. And they&#39;re bookended with pistachios. The. Way. It. Should. Be. 

I&#39;m a big fan of Elena&#39;s and surely I&#39;ll be back soon...at least to procure a dozen lemon cookies."

There are a couple of glass cases inside with 2 small tables with 4 total chairs.  

But in the back is where the magic happens.  Fresh baked made in-house bread.  Balsamic vinegar on sandwiches to add more flavor.  Pesto to elevate the caprese sandwich.  I am not a vegetarian but decided to run through the gauntlet of sandwiches and tried the eggplant parmesan.  Their son Mario mentioned their top 3 selling sandwiches being the Mario&#39;s Italian, Salvatore&#39;s prosciutto and bocconcini, and Elena&#39;s caprese, but the eggplant parm is one very underrated star on their menu.  Thinly sliced and lightly breaded but full of flavor.  We also took home some arancini which are smaller than others so you get more crunch for the bite.  The large focaccia have a crispy bottom but soft interior that is so enjoyable on its own.  They gave us a sample of tomato and garlic knots which were also phenomenal.

That&#39;s the kind of relationship I&#39;m in. He&#39;s the Felix Unger and I&#39;m Oscar Madison all the way. 

He&#39;s neat, orderly, disciplined, reasonable, practical, genius-level smarts and for the most part, incredibly kind (though he doesn&#39;t seem to fancy cats much).

I&#39;m a mess. I leave crap everywhere. I rarely clean up after myself. I&#39;m terrible with money, even worse with math, and there&#39;s actually been times (multiple) where I&#39;ve been so lazy that I&#39;ve actually lied about brushing my teeth. I know, I know. But at least I admit it. Sure, I should probably be more ashamed and I&#39;m sure there&#39;s some deeper psychological stuff there, but for now we&#39;ll all just have to settle for my own admission of these facts and I&#39;ll just go on pretending that my level of sloppy is still cute and okay. 

How does this this bit of information take me to Elena&#39;s Cucina? Well, I&#39;ll tell you... just like I always do, whether you want to hear it or not.

People are always telling me how lucky I am to have my SO. No one EVER says the reverse to him. And I know they&#39;re right and that I should be thanking my lucky stars day in and day out, but sometimes... sometimes I think, &#39;This is it. This is the day I throw him from a moving vehicle if he doesn&#39;t pull that stick out of his ass right-quick.&#39;

Luckily, it only took one life-changing visit to a little storefront in a business park off Lake Street to find the perfect way to curb his (and my impending) crankiness: Order anything from Elena&#39;s Magical Cucina.

Priced for even a pauper like myself, you can get a heaping sandwich on fresh, homemade bread with the highest quality artisan ingredients. Fresh made pizza with homemade dough, fresh homemade focaccia bread, fresh and homemade pasta and more -- all fresh and all homemade right there on the spot! 

The shop is almost completely hidden from street view and while there are two tiny two-seater tables inside, it&#39;s main hub of business seems to be from catering/carry-out orders. It&#39;s counter service or call ahead, and while normally I&#39;m monstrously impatient and hate waiting, I actually had a really fun time just sitting and listening to my SO tell the play-by-play of our sandwiches being made in the back kitchen. 

Everything from pulling the fresh bread loaves, to slicing cheese straight from the block. This is as from-scratch as it gets, folks. You should expect your order, no matter if it&#39;s a salad or sandwich or pizza to take around 15-20 minutes, because like I said - EVERYTHING is done from scratch. They don&#39;t pre-make, slice, set anything so your food is fondled by as few people as possible before it hits your lips. 

On our virgin visit, Mario was manning the counter and put together both our veggie pesto sandwich and our Caprese sandwich. Mario, that dude... I owe my life as a free man to him for saving my boo and I from what could have been a very disastrous (possibly murderous) day of exploring the suburbs on an empty stomach together. 

Mario made us up these heaping sandwiches, though only 6-inches each according to the menu, we eye-balled them at closer to 7&#34; and spent the first minute and half of the sandwiches being placed in front of us in awe of how absolutely picturesque and perfect they were. Loaded with more-than-generous ingredient portions, this is the kind of food that&#39;ll make your Italian Nonna rethink her decades-old family recipes. 

Elena&#39;s... they do Italian deli right and unlike any other. I&#39;ve honestly never had anything quite like it and I&#39;ve never seen my SO&#39;s empty stomach+crabby patty mood dissipate so quickly. It was like we transitioned out of being The Odd Couple and moved into a more Darrin &amp; Samantha of Bewitched-type scenario where I just wiggled my nose (or in this case, ordered a sandwich) and all of a sudden Darrin&#39;s sourpuss turns to sparkles and smiles and we all have a happy ending.  

We ended up shaking Mario&#39;s hand before we left because we were so thankful to him for what he&#39;d done for us... made us the best damn sandwiches we&#39;ve ever had, and for $10 total for the both of us, no less. 

I know where I&#39;ll be getting all future parties catered from and I know where I&#39;ll be headed the next time I have a hankering for the best Italian sandwich on the planet... which as it turns out, is fairly often."

Just picked up a lunch order for my office.  I didn&#39;t cry while eating this sandwich, but that&#39;s because my co-workers would think I&#39;m even more of a loon.  But I digress...

My zucchini parm was on point.  Bread wasn&#39;t mushy, still warm a half hour later.  My mouth is watering and I just ate the thing. 

My friend that had the Mario looked at me wide eyed and said that the sandwich made it into his top three best sandwich&#39;s of all time.   Another co-worker explained that there was just something so special about the bread.  While another co-worker just made audible happy noises as he stuffed his face with the sausage focaccia.

In summary: yay."

They had a stuffed portobello mushroom that was phenomenal.   Ordered a 6&#34; roast beef (home made) that was fantastic.  --more like 8-9inches overstuffed. 

Now I know why people come back.   At the end of the meal Mario figured out who I was based on my review.   We talked for a bit, and his philosophy on food and eating is as refreshing add the flavors. 

A True Gem.   Anyone that goes to any deli or sandwich place within 15 minutes of here is wasting their gas. 

I would return here all the time if I lived locally.   They would be my choice for catering or special events where sandwiches, platters, salads, etc or desserts were called for.

I have been buying there delish foccacia from the farmers market for years.  I always knew they had a place but never made it out there as I was satisfied with my weekly fix from the market.  One day I had the brilliant idea to take the boyfriend and the teenager there for lunch...holy hell what was i missing????  He had the Italien sammich, I had the meatball sammich and the veggie teenager had the cesear salad.  All were phenominal.  We capped it off with the lemon cookies.   I think i just about died with happiness.  

Upon deciding on who would cater my daughters graduation, we pondered and then decided that Elenas should do the job.  Of course, we made this decision right about lunch time on a saturday...so off we went for lunch.  He got the italien again and I had one with prosciutto and burrata.  Im pretty sure I started crying at the table it was so good.  After inhaling lunch, we decided the catering and ordered 3 cheese lasagna, sausage and peppers, vesuvio potatoes and chicken tenders.  Everything was so good.  People are still talking about how good it was 2 days later.  I love this place.

This is a gem.  I will for sure be back for more food and im trying to think of another reason to cater another party.  Sammich, chicken tenders, sausage, potatoes, lemon cookies.  UGH! Now im hungry.  I love you Elena...like a fat kid loves cake.  Thank you!"

Went in not knowing what to expect because it&#39;s kind of tucked away in a little strip mall off Lake St and there is a pretty big hill in front of the building so it&#39;s hard to see.  I would say I have easily driven past this place hundreds of times and always wondered what it was.  Boy was I glad my husband asked me to go here!  First of all the gentleman behind the counter, Mario, was super friendly and professional from the minute I walked in the door.  There weren&#39;t any other customers there at the time I walked in and he greeted me within seconds.  I told him I had never been there before so I wasn&#39;t sure what to order.  He said they have daily specials and explained each one to me for that day.  I order what my husband wanted which was so fresh and honestly the best Italian sub I have ever tasted!  Crunchy bread, fresh lunch meat, tomato, lettuce, spices, and the dressing on the sandwich was so good.  I didn&#39;t taste the antipasto salad but it looked amazing.  I order eggplant parmesan with some meatballs and sauce.  Again, was very pleasantly surprised by the nice egg coating on the eggplant and the meatballs were soft and the sauce tasted homemade.  I also took a trip to their dessert case which had the best Italian lemon cookies I&#39;ve ever had!!!  So soft and moist with that delicious lemon glaze.  My mouth is watering just thinking about them again, a perfect cookie to have with your coffee.

I saw the meat and cheese being sliced on the spot for my sandwich and the ingredients were absolutely superb. Plus, kudos for thick cut cheese that I could taste in every delicious bite, made even more
perfect with the occasional infusion of sweet balsamic and oil. I topped off the meal with a lemon cookie which put every other lemon cookie I&#39;ve ever eaten to shame.

It is their product and their service that clearly keep people coming back.

I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to consider having them cater any event you need food for. No dish is a throwaway or an after thought. They want everything from the sides to the entrees to impress, and they do. 

The woman who took my order and made my sandwich was sweet and meticulous. She treated me like a family member she was creating a meal for, even though I was only there for a few minutes. What more could you want?

They have a fairly extensive assortment of foods not listed on the menu. These recline in the comfort of an immaculate display cooler. Zucchini patties? Check. Pickled Beets? Check. All their items are home made right there. 
Very tiny, only 2 small tables. Also, their location is somewhat odd; it&#39;s a light industrial building that houses several business that have nothing to do with consumers. You enter off the side street (Garden St.). Well worth the trip, large Mario only 7 clams, WITH a bag of chips!"

The sandwiches I ordered were great! And the lemon cookies, yea... They are as good as every one in the reviews says they are.

It is not the easiest place to access (or see) from lake street. But sometimes the best things are hidden. 

Also, if you are in a hurry, don&#39;t be! It&#39;s gonna take a few minutes to make your sandwich. Because they don&#39;t have a bunch of pre-sliced meats and cheeses laying around. They take the time to hand slice them up.

And if you order a large sandwich, you got enough for lunch the next day!  The small is more than enough even for a big eater.

I have been dreaming about Elena&#39;s sandwiches for weeks now, I just cant get them out of my head.  After just one bit I knew I was in for a wonderful experience and it just got better as the meal went on.  We split a veggie pesto sub and the Caprese sandwich, though I ended up eating more then my fair share since they were both so wonderful.  I just kept going back and forth each time forgetting how wonderful the other sub was until I took another bit.  All I remember saying is &#34;So good!  So good!  It is just so good!&#34;  So let me break it down.

Elena&#39;s subs are on fresh baked bread - this is good, chewy, Italian bread that makes you savor your sandwich.  The subs are packed full of goodness with extra thick cuts of cheese, I am talking 1/2 inch or better cuts of cheese.  That alone won me over but it gets better.  These sandwiches are made fresh with incredible detail and mindfulness that what comes out of the kitchen is a work of art.  O yeah, and the sandwiches were absolutely amazing, packed with so much flavor that I can say with out a doubt they are the best I have ever had.  All that for wonderfulness for Subway prices so it is definitely the best for the cost - no contest.  The bar and this cucina is set super high that I dont know if anyone else can compete, all future sandwiches I eat will have to compare to Elena&#39;s.  

Well anyway - the storefront itself is a nice, small, deli that feels a little bit like home.  There are a couple display cases of treats, some drinks in a cooler, two tables, a huge kitchen, and tons of photos and clippings on the walls.  It seemed like most of their business is catering or carryout but I enjoy dinning in, so we did and it ended up being a great choice.  It just feels like home and we were treated like family, making it a wonderful experience.  The only issue is that it is rather hard to find for first timers and for some reason GMaps could not get us there.  Lucky we found our way but if you are lost their website has a map of where they are located.  Overall I could not be more pleased with Elena&#39;s and I am just itching at the chance to come back!

P.S. The lemon cookies .... so good!"

Luckily, I stopped by for a sandwich and a salad the other day, since my SO had a day off and it seemed like a nice thing to share. 

When you go into Elena&#39;s, there&#39;s a nice little display case with some Italian cookies and freshly made food sitting in it. There are also a couple of little tables, and some cute homey decorations that make you instantly feel like this is a place that cares about what they do. Elena&#39;s does a lot of catering business, but they also have a little menu on a chalkboard behind the display cases. If you have trouble reading it, they also have paper menus available over by the register. 

They offer several sub, panini, and salad options -- and if you want to change what&#39;s on the menu? They&#39;re happy to accommodate you. At first, this might be a little intimidating. If you know what you want, however, you&#39;ll be fine.

For example, my SO really wanted a roast beef sandwich. He also loves grilled and roasted veggies (minus onion) and pesto. I saw the cold grilled veggie sandwich with pesto on the menu, and asked if they could add roast beef. 

The woman (Elena? Not sure. I should have asked -- she was so sweet!) smiled and said, &#34;Of course!&#34; 

Not only did she add roast beef -- she sliced it fresh right then and there. RIGHT THEN AND THERE, PEOPLE. She also let me add grilled eggplant to the sandwich. I ordered a large sub (subs come in 6&#34; or 10&#34; sizes) , which automatically comes with a bag of chips. My SO was so happy with his sandwich, he ate it very slowly -- something he never does. He also asked why we&#39;d never had Elena&#39;s food before. Another first: he couldn&#39;t finish the sandwich in one sitting. He ate it for lunch AND dinner. 

As for me, I ordered an antipasto salad for myself. I, too, didn&#39;t have room for dinner. That was a DELIGHTFUL salad. Homemade balsamic vinaigrette was perfect. Quality of the cured Italian meats in the sandwich couldn&#39;t be nicer -- and mmm, beautiful kalamata olives with perfect brininess! 

Of special note: in both the salad and the sandwich, the tomatoes were bursting with ripeness -- something which alone can win my heart over. I even said to the woman preparing my food, &#34;Thank you for using ripe tomatoes!&#34; She responded, &#34;I only like them when they&#39;re ripe, too.&#34; That? That&#39;s someone who cares. That&#39;s who you want preparing your food. 

The bottom line? Even something as seemingly simple as salads and sandwiches is greatly affected by the quality of the ingredients used. Elena&#39;s takes such pride in what they&#39;re doing that you can&#39;t ask for better. This will become a go-to place for us, I&#39;m sure. So they&#39;re not open for dinner? We&#39;ll just have to plan better so we can enjoy their deliciousness more often. :9"

I don&#39;t normally like lemon-flavored desserts, but both the flavor and texture of her cookies were outstanding. They&#39;re almost not really cookies--more like a mix between a scone and a cake, but shaped like a cookie, topped with ultra lemony icing. Box of 4 for $5. So worth it.

The focaccia, with an incredibly garlicky crust, was great. We weren&#39;t as much a fan of the zucchini parmesan. Both were on the salty side, but the spaghetti I cooked at home helped to tone it down.

Will be returning to try other dishes like the lasagne!"

I first discovered Elena&#39;s at the farmers market at Daley Plaza in Chicago.  They would often be sold out of the focaccia pizzas by Noon.  They also attend the Schaumburg Farmer&#39;s Market every Friday.  The Roselle restaurant isn&#39;t easy to locate, but one you find it I&#39;m sure you return over and over."

Was looking for some lunch today and decided to search yelp for lunch near my house.    Came across Elena&#39;s and couldn&#39;t tell off hand if it was a deli or just catering or both.   Gave them a quick call where Salvatore answered and said yes, they did serve lunch.   Dropped off my son at preschool and away we went.   

Walked into a small unassuming storefront and saw a nice glass case filled with lemon cookies and other pastries on one side and premade dishes on the other.   Decided on a few things for lunch including a meatball sandwich, proscuitto/fresh mozzarella sub, pasta salad and lemon cookies.   The owners were very nice, smiling and talking about their grand-daughter and giving suggestions.   Placed our order and waited.   

Prices were fine - about 20 bucks for all that food which was within reason.   

Got the food home and tore in.  Meatballs were excellent.   Not too dense, not too loose.  Sauce was good with them and the sandwich was stuffed.   Proscuitto/fresh mozzarella could have used a touch more meat, but they used an excellent balsamic vinegar on both sides of the sandwich that soaked into the bread and gave a great flavor.  The pasta salad was very good BUT the lemon cookies were to die for.   I&#39;m going back for more.  Seriously, like after I finish this review, I need more.

You can find their products at farmer&#39;s markets including Daley Plaza so if you see them, get them.  Will go back for the pizza and foccaccia."

I had the Italian roast beef sandwich.  It would have been good with just the roll it can on.  But the huge attack of roast beef put it way over the top.

The woman that made the sandwich was very nice as was the young man that was there. I mentioned that I was there due to their outstanding reviews.

Two small sandwiches and a box of lemon cookies came out to $18. I read the reviews on Elena&#39;s and everyone said to get the lemon cookies. I wasn&#39;t a big fan.

I was on going my lunch break and yelped a few places and found this deli. A sandwich sounded nice so I went searching for it. I could not have been more pleasantly surprised. This place is definitely a hidden gem!

As soon as I walked in I immediately felt welcome, they explained the menu and their case of freshly made pastas and meatballs. I ordered a 6 inch sub and a little bit of homemade pasta. I watched them make my sub and all the meet was freshly sliced. While I waited the owner brought out some baked eggplant on a plate for me to try. Once I got in the car, the pasta smelled so good that I actually had to stop and try it on the way back to the office. It was SO good I couldn&#39;t stop eating it.

Elena&#39;s Lemon Cookies: are like nothing I have ever tasted.  They are absolutely life-changing. I&#39;m not a big &#39;lemon&#39; flavored type girl...but with each bite of her lemon cookies...you feel hugs from the Italian grandmas you never had.  We fight over them at work and I take this cookie fight seriously.  

I have ordered a lot of sandwiches here both for lunch, and finger-style for seminars and events.  All of my clients love eating her food, its not just me that feels this way.

I can&#39;t think of a place in Naperville that is a better for post-party munchies.  The drive thru is open until 4 am on the weekends, and the dining room until 3 am.  If you can&#39;t decide what to try, I would recommend the chicken and enchiladas.  The mole sauce is homemade and to die for.  My husband orders six and brings three home for the next day&#39;s lunch.  
I am always torn between el pastors tacos or a chorizo breakfast burrito.  The pork in the tacos is flavored to perfection, and I am a huge fan of chorizo burritos from this joint.  The mini is usually big enough to fill up my belly.  
The dinners come with rice and refried beans.  I don&#39;t like beans so swap them out for double rice with no issues.
My two major complaints are about the dining room.  Sometimes it is hard to find a table that has been wiped down after a rush.  And the awesome sauce bar for dine in customers only can get empty at times.  But if you mention either of these issues, the nice owner or his staff are quick to fix them.
My one recommendation would be to hire another cook and clerk so you can serve breakfast.  One of your competitors on Ogden is always packed weekend mornings, and we think how cool it would be to have Sunday brunch at good ole El Hogar."

If you are getting tacos, choose al pastor. The steak was tough little nodules, cut in too small pieces. I liked that they put the refried beans in a little tortilla &#34;cup&#34; so they didn&#39;t ooze into everything else. Horchata was very cinnamony and very sweet.

Their horchata is probably the best around and I will come here to just get that sometimes!!!! Most of the time I get the mini burrito because it&#39;s perfect for me. I get that awesome burrito in a small package...just like me awesome but petite!! :)
They have late night hours so it&#39;s great for those weekend nights after the bars! Perfect bar pre-hangover food.
Only weird thing is though is that the drive thru is going to be on the passenger side of the car when you pull up.....don&#39;t worry though....they have a basket on a pole to get you your yummies!!!"

Had an Al Pastor taco which was good, and a steak mini burrito.  The mini burrito was average at best.  Way too much lettuce in the burrito, and lacking on the meat.  I know I only ordered a mini, but it seemed like I had more meat in my taco than my burrito!
The salsa mini bar was good, but the sauces, were, well.... original.  It was like a puree, one orange and one green.  Good flavor but definitely very strange to look at, and a weird syrup like texture.  
They claim the best Horchata around?  Me thinks not!  I ordered it and they filled my cup from a pitcher in the cooler... REALLY?
If you are driving by and want some Mexican food, go for it, but I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way."

After reviewing our options on Yelp, he chose El Hogar, which terrified me because I&#39;ve driven by and, c&#39;mon, the place looks like a shack run by Satan, weird fluorescent lights glowing from the windows all hours of the night and about 2 feet by 2 feet in total space. But alas, I love him (and tacos) so we tried it out.

It definitely wasn&#39;t bad, but I have to say the overall shack-like atmosphere did permeate into the interior - greasy, dumpy, unkempt kind of a place. The fiancé ordered the carne asada, and I got the chiles rellenos burrito. We sat down with our giant styrofoam cup drinks and waited for our food.

The food was fast and hot, and clearly freshly cooked. If I had ordered the carne asada, I&#39;d have been PISSED. It was tough and completely unseasoned. Dom didn&#39;t hate it, but left a lot of it uneaten in favor of the rice and beans. My burrito was REALLY flavorful but SO greasy that I felt kind of gross afterward. I ordered the &#34;giant&#34; size (don&#39;t judge!) and wasn&#39;t really overwhelmed by the Chipotle-esque size. We ordered two churros after we ate because hello, churros! and they, too, were a little bland, but tasty enough.

Overall, if you&#39;re looking for a fun restaurant with free chips and salsa and some semblance of atmosphere, skip this place. If you&#39;re hungover as hell and want to indulge in some grease-tastic mexi-debauchery, then this is your spot. As for me, I probably won&#39;t be back. Unless I take up a tequila problem, or decide I need saltless meat, STAT."

Perhaps I&#39;ve been spoiled by burrito sizes at other locations, but when they say &#34;giant burrito,&#34; I expected something huge. Thus, I opted for a mini burrito only to learn that I could easily have finished the regular size. Considering the price (which will most likely be more than what it says on the menu) and taste of the food though, you definitely have better options in the area.

I was turned onto the place by a friend. She had been studying in Latin America for about a year and a half, we wanted to celebrate her coming back and we both had a craving for Mexican so she told me about this place for lunch.

The food was seasoned well, staff was extremely friendly, the free cup of soup was nice (I always get the black bean, it is amazing). I have never had anything greasey or that did not taste good on the menu. Although I am not much of a chicken person nor flautas, but the tamales and the roasted poblano are quite good!

... I just wish it wasn&#39;t like playing russian roulette every time I ate here.

About half of the time I have eaten here, the food takes revenge and does terrible things to my body an hour later coughcough

-Chicken Enchiladas Suizo: cheesy, saucy Chicken goodness

-Chicken Quesidillas: I recommend getting the individual, appetizer &#39;dillas over the meal because they are huge, full of chicken and much cheaper! Two of these at under $4 is definitely a steal. 

-Nachos Supreme: late night chow! Or anytime chow, but the only way you can feel slightly okay with eating this is if you&#39;ve consumed copious amounts of booze. These nachos are the real deal and loaded with goodies on top including guac, cheese, beans, beef, sour cream, etc. 

-Chile Relleno: order this if you dine in, and you will not regret it. They make it perfectly. 

My boyfriend loves their mini burritos, which are a nice option if you can&#39;t decide on one of their burritos. They are about 1/2 the size of a regular burrito. He usually gets the shrimp, chicken or breakfast burrito. If you dine in, you get free chips and salsa!"

Then I look at their PDF of the menu and it&#39;s all &#39;Best &#34;Horchata&#34; in Chicago Area!!&#34;  Of course, both are unattributed, but I like a good horchata, so that settled it.

Yeah, it&#39;s not the best.

We got the guacamole, it was okay, but just not as good as other local area places (Los Dos has really good guacamole).  My wife got a vegetarian burrito and she was horrified at the amount of raw carrot in it, she had been worried that the menu said there&#39;d be celery and she&#39;s not crazy about it, but it turned out that the carrots really overshadowed it all.

I&#39;ve been a couple times, and both times it&#39;s just been OK. To be honest, Los Comales west in Aurora, is much better. And it might have to do with the size. I&#39;m a devotee of the al pastor and chorizo tacos, and both seem much fresher at Los Comales - specifically, the al pastor at El Hogar has been chewy both times I&#39;ve had it, and it&#39;s always amazing at Los Comales. But, It&#39;s close to a family member near by, so I suspect I will be back. But we all seemed to agree that Los Comales is a better (if not more distant) option.

The restaurant itself was clean, but very empty at a lunch hour.  The prices were reasonable, service was nice, but the food, while not terrible, was just bland and very lacking in flavor and texture.  For example, a chicken burrito consisted of: chicken, iceberg lettuce, and a wrapper.  The chicken itself was not bad on it own as it had obviously been marinated and/or slow cooked, but it lacked enough seasoning to hold it&#39;s own against lettuce.

The place was small and it operated like a fast food place.  There were no waiters and you had to clear your own spot, and everything was served on nice restaurant style plates, but we had to use plastic ware from a bin.  The tables had not been wiped down when we were there.

The food was not bad, but it was bland.  My boy liked his tacos, but the rest of us got burrito dinners.  The rice and beans portions were very plain, small and seemed to have been made using store bought mixes.  The burritos were of a decent size, but the meat was also bland.  I do not eat a lot of salt, so it did not bother me that much but my wife was very dissatisfied with it.  Also, the burritos had iceberg lettuce as a filler and not the usually beans and/or rice I see at other restaurants.  Also, everything was at about room temperature or lower.  None of the food was hot.

The chips and salsa were okay, but they were definitely prepackaged chips and I am not sure what was going on with the salsa.  It tasted okay, but it was a really odd orange color.  I enjoyed my horchata, and the churros were fresh, hot and tasty.

The worst part of it all, was that the burrito dinners were $8 each.  The food was way overpriced for what you were getting.

I&#39;ve always kept it simple when ordering from here - tacos, burritos and chips/salsa. The salsa and red sauces are still superb. Homemade family recipes from what I&#39;ve been told. But what I&#39;ve always enjoyed here were the steak and al pastor tacos and burritos. They used to be some of the best in suburbs.  People would line up for loaded burritos full of great steak and real chihuahua cheese.  Long lines at 6pm during the week were the norm. No need to wait in line to order anymore.  It seems that many customers like myself are looking for a new favorite burrito spot.  My past few visits here were so disappointing.  The burritos can now be classified as skimpy.  What cheese?  Would you like some meat with your lettuce?  The steak they use now is flavorless and rather tough.  The al pastor is bland and fatty.  The lack of quality ingredients shows.  I wish that they&#39;d charge an extra buck and up the quality.  I guess if it&#39;s 2am and you&#39;re hammered from too many Beam and Cokes from Bar Louie this place will do, but sadly I&#39;ve given them their last chance."

  The menu had so many choices but I settled on the Gyro dinner and a pizza puff, as was recommended by others.   The meat was tender and moist and the bread was fresh. The fries were a little larger than the shoestrings Ive had and thankfully not those honkin&#39; fat ones served by some places that have you wishing you had ordered a baked potato.

I&#39;m glad I finally decided to try this place out, it&#39;s much closer and convenient as opposed to driving to Woodridge. 

I got a gyro with fries and an RC cola - yes, they have RC and it&#39;s amazing. Gyro was fresh and the fries had just the right amount of salt, no ketchup needed. You get a good amount of food for the price you pay.

Also, they&#39;re one of the few greek places that uses the thinner-cut french fries, which are a bit like McDonald&#39;s but taste much, much better in my option.  My disappointment is their Italian sausage, which I&#39;ve ordered only once, came out too dry for my taste. 

I&#39;ve only done take-out, the place is pretty small and typical of your grease-spoon ambiance.  There&#39;s a TV and some basic tables.  I wouldn&#39;t recommend eating at Prenos but I would certainly recommend grabbing a gryo or two for take out."

Last night, I dreamed about a gyros so I was really in the mood. I woke up and checked yelp for a great gyros near me. In my search I found this place. I decided after running all of my errands that I would stop by and give this place a shot. I was so nervous because often times when you get your hopes up  too high, you don&#39;t quite get your needs met. Can I just say that I was not disappointed at all. The cashier was a young guy who was super friendly. I mentioned yelp to the cashier and he said yeah we get really good reviews for the gyros which is what we are really known for. They do sell other things. I looked into the kitchen which was just a little sketchy but it is that kind of place. It was clean which is all that mattered. I immediately look to make sure that I could see the gyros rotisserie cooker to make sure that it is cooked there fresh. After that, I ordered the gyros meal that was $7.19 which included fries and a 12 oz drink. I got a side of feta. I don&#39;t know if that was extra or not. Can you believe that they sell RC products from the fountain? Very rare to see. I filled my cup with Splice (A soda most under 20 may have never heard of) and waited for my food. Several people came in while I was waiting and everyone ordered gyros as well. I got my food rather quickly and got it to go. The bag was full and my fries were almost falling out of the bag so I stuck my finger to grab a fry or two on my drive home. They were shoestring fries with just enough salt on them. They were both hot and fresh. i kept grabbing a couple so by the time I got home the fries were just about gone (no ketchup needed) leaving me to deal with the gyros. I don&#39;t call myself a gyros connoisseur but I dare say that the gyros was delicious. It was more than enough meat which was full of flavor, nicely seasoned and good consistency, it had nice portion of onions and plentiful on the sauce which was also really good.  My whole experience was excellent. I have no complaints whatsoever. The menu states that they sell gyros and chicken gyros by the pound. I had never of heard of anyone selling it that way but it is good to know. Next time, I will try the chicken gyros  I never tried one before. I would also like to try the roasted chicken pita so you can see that I will definitely be back. Thanks again to all my fellow Yelpers that never seems to let me down."

Fancy doesn&#39;t exist here. I did recently revisit here and was still please with the service and food. I worked not far from here years back and over the years, they&#39;ve delivered very good fast food. The staff is very polite and though sometime they could be a wait, the wait isn&#39;t all that bad (when compared to its peers). Don&#39;t let the close quarters scare you off. 

So what&#39;s the story? Here it is:
1. The gyros are insane as it relates to portion. I would go as far to say this is a food challenge level of portions (e.g., eat all of this in 30 minutes and you get a free shirt). Sauce was very good along with fresh tomatoes and onions. One of the areas better gyros as a whole. 

2. The burgers were solid (somewhere between mortal and monster). Not too big but not small either. Always juicy though. Grilled chicken is also another solid choice. As for the hot dogs, I&#39;ll be honest. I never had one here but those who have say they&#39;re good. 

3. Prices are in line with other places but you might pay more elsewhere for the gyro. 

Pretty short and sweet. This is another place you&#39;ll get a good meal at a nice fast food price."

The complimentary chips and salsa came pretty quickly and were pretty good although I&#39;m not really a fan of hot(temperature) salsa. The food didn&#39;t take very long at all and our waitress was very nice and a little sassy(in a good way). I ordered the taco dinner Al Pastor and my broseph ordered chips &amp; guacamole with a side of grilled jalapenos/onions, he&#39;s one of them there vegetarians. All of the flavors were good and we both joined the clean plate club, haha. So...

Do I dig the place? Sure
Would I recommend them? Yes

Food came out lickety-split. We tried 3 different tacos (beef, pork, and the mushroom - which was a special of the day) and all were really good.  They are small tacos you can buy individually so it&#39;s nice to try a variety and also to accommodate both small &amp; large appetites. Their salsas were darn good, too. Oh, and the cucumber margarita was soooooo delicous!

The only down side was the tortilla chips must have been sitting out in the basket to put on the table a bit too long as they weren&#39;t quite as crispy as they should have been.  There was no offer to refill the basket once we emptied it, either (it wasn&#39;t a huge basket of chips like you get at some places so we finished it off easily).  If it hadn&#39;t been for the chips and if it wasn&#39;t just our first time there I was tempted to give them 5 stars.

But the nice staff, quality of the tacos, salsas and margarita will bring us back to try them again the next time we are wandering around Batavia and in need of good grub, for sure!"

First: The margaritas. They didn&#39;t have frozen or blended (normally I&#39;m a rocks girl, but I was feeling blended on my first visit) so I ended up with a peach margarita. Actually... I had two peach margs. And part of a lime marg. And they were FANTASTIC. Child had her first horchata ever here, and she loved it. I was impressed. She thought it tasted like a &#34;liquid churro&#34; and that pretty much nails it. 

Housemade chips and salsa are solid, as is the guac. Queso fundido was excellent, as were the pork tacos and cheese enchiladas. (No, not all mine. But I&#39;m a taster.) But what keeps me coming back is the Bistec ala Mexicana. I can&#39;t stop. I&#39;m becoming a tad bit obsessed in that I want this for dinner every single night. 

Agree with other reviewers that you&#39;re not coming for the ambiance, but actually, sitting outside and people watching is quite nice. They do have some outdoor seating. And everyone here is really friendly. It&#39;s in a busy shopping center next to Batavia Creamery, and there always seem to be people coming and going. 

Takeout business seems to be fairly robust. Portions are smaller than what you get during dine-in, but still satisfying. 

I&#39;m a very happy camper having this place nearby."

The Steak Tacos can be very good or very dry with the texture of ball bearings. The meat crumbles as it falls from the shell and rolls around on the table at will.

The Taco Dorados can be the best around as long as the cook removes them from the deep fryer before they transform into &#34;Hot Pockets&#34;. The accompanying warm salsa is delicious and can be a substitute for a cup of soup. An occasional slurp is not out of the question.

The margaritas are highly recommended. They actually make an effort with the homemade formulation. Smart move on their part!

 The ambiance is limited and bordering &#34;drab&#34; however the service makes up for it. The ladies actually crack a smile or two!

The location is a small strip mall and parking is a premium, so if you can, ride your bicycle or better yet...hitch-hike."

I called in before I got there for takeout and it was ready when I arrived 15 minutes later. Tasty fish lightly batter fried but not oily wrapped in mini flour tortillas. Fresh crunchy, cole slaw (not the creamy kind!) Cilantro, pico de gallo and avocado slices topped this tasty treat. Other reviews stating the fish tacos were good were not wrong! It wasn&#39;t a taco shell but I prefer tortillas anyway.  Flavorful rice and refried beans completed this satisfying meal.

For starters, I&#39;ve been spoiled be El Faro in Elgin, which in my book is exactly what a little cheap Mexican place should be.

Here are my complaints:  first and foremost, the food just doesn&#39;t taste that good- I&#39;d say mediocre at best.  In addition, they have tried to up-sell us almost every time we&#39;ve been in there, which I find insulting and uncomfortable.  If they are experiencing financial trouble, maybe they should try improving their food before putting pressure on people to buy more.  When I order their taco combo, the portion of beans and rice was comically small- don&#39;t they realize that they&#39;d be better off serving ample portions of cheap things like B&amp;R? ( Here is a tip:  order three single tacos and a side of beans &amp; rice and you&#39;ll get more food.  But then they will badger you to get the combo....)  It was like a table spoon of each.....Which in light of my next complaint, I should be grateful for:  I then got an awful stomach ache.  Not sure how clean that place is....   Nothing is really that good there, including the runny salsa they serve with the chips.  Skip it and make your own, better tacos at home."

I was saying to wifey i am feeling i want to go out for steak  ,, so i searched on yelp and i came to this business..  We arrived,, and let it be known this place is VERY loud,, good country music playing on a jukebox as you walk in apparently you can choose what youd like to hear...Waitress came was very freindly, we ordered a couple ice teas as it was very hot out... 

The appitizers:  we started with the cheese fries,, and the flowered onion  both  EXCELLENT and great portion

The meal  i ordered the porterhouse this thing was nice 26 oz,, fig about 5-6 oz for the bone..  but it was a good portion of meat.., wifey had the BBQ chicken...  sides of mash potaotes salad on my end,, and she had a salad and the rice,, all excellent...

I will give a warning we dont dont eat pork of any kind anymore  the green beans are cooked in  bacon  , and we had a issue with that also being the case in the mash potatoes  however excellent management apologized for the bad communication as we told them about  our preferences,, as the fries normally came with bacon as well...((that was fine))

we will definately come back...  the food was excellent...and the service prompt and couteous..

The Finall Bill..........58.63  however we were pleased to see after management discount,, 45.62....plus tip///////

greak steaks  and me and wifey really enjoyed ourselves at the texas roadhouse

Worth it. The service was great and so was the food. We had to wait about five minutes for a table and, bonus, there are peanuts in the waiting area. It&#39;s a fun thing to throw the shells on the floor! We were quickly brought to our table and immediately served fresh bread with a cinnamon butter. Our server was attentive to our needs without hovering. My husband declared that his steak was better than the ones he&#39;d had at expensive steakhouses. I was shocked (in a good way!) when the bill came - about $70 for an appetizer, two meals, a Coke and a beer! We&#39;ll definitely be back."

The food really was over the top, definitely coming back! Our waiter, Michael Christian, was also truly nothing short of amazing.

There was none other than Texas Roadhouse in which we were able to gorge platters of food without doing regrettable damage to our wallets. 

Our quad started off with the combination platter of appetizer that consisted of potato skin, jalapeno cheese balls, and buffalo wings. I am usually a fan of combination platters because I am greedy and want to try a variety. The items were standard bar food. Majority of them were fried but that isn&#39;t going to stop me from digging in. 

For entrees, my partner in crime and I had the combination dinner of rib-eye steak, barbecue ribs, steak fries, and buttered corn. This Texas-size feast was well within $30. If you&#39;re a red-meat lover, I would highly recommend this selection. You are welcomed to take the challenge and complete this feast on your own. We opted with the safer route and split. The rib-eye was grilled to our preference of medium rare. It was particularly tender and and juicy, especially considering the low price tag. The Texan barbecue ribs were flavorful but the meat was slightly tough. Hold in by the bone and tear the meat off. The sides were standard, vegetarian complements so we didn&#39;t have to feel that bad about consuming all that red meat. 

Our other pair of dinner companions had the barbecue roasted half chicken, barbecue ribs, house salad, and steak fries. The portion was just as Texan as ours but everything else fell short. I would safely say, this isn&#39;t quite the right place to order chicken although I understand they did so for health reasons. My motto is always to eat first and worry later. 

With all that said, the minimal collateral damage and large portion of meat served are enough to earn my revisit. I am doomed to return and indulge."
texas-roadhouse-naperville,Mike O.,vmz9lMieICyu1npcDTakaA,"Aurora, IL",1,1,1,10,65,9cZC5JiJfbIFue0QiZns7g,3.0,2015-12-09,"I want to say that I am a huge Texas Roadhouse fan.  I have been to TR restaurants in Kenosha, WI, Decatur, IL and this one here in Naperville, IL.  They have a four star product and service which borders on five star.  

Tonight the end product was four star, but the service was two stars or less.  It was not the effort or attentiveness, but lack of quality in communication, which leaves unanswered questions and a dissatisfied customer.  

When we arrived we were seated under an air conditioning vent.  It was blowing so hard you could see the wax paper (the same holding those delicious rolls) moving.  A/C? With the outside temp in the mid 40s?  Then they move us, but I&#39;m still cold.  

The steaks arrive and my medium rare is decidedly rare, so rare the red is gleaming at me.  Now, if you&#39;re the restaurant, what do you do?  TR obviously has a policy to address this situation, and they whisked away my steak and my loaded with sweetness potatoes with them leaving me nothing to eat.  I was eyeing the last roll which had moved to my better half&#39;s plate.  She wouldn&#39;t make eye contact with me as if to say, &#34;Don&#39;t even think about it.&#34;  

I didn&#39;t like the restaurant&#39;s response.  By the time my food arrived, Virginia was done.  Now she&#39;s staring at me while I&#39;m eating.  What could have been done better?  I would have liked to be included in the decision.  Ask me.  If they would have I would told them to leave the potato, take the same steak (12 oz ribeye) sear it on both sides a couple of times and bring it back to me.  Their policy is to replace the steak which took 20 minutes roundtrip, just enough time for Virginia to down a 6 ouncer and stare at me while she sipped her water.

There&#39;s a tip lesson in all this.  Our waiter who was perfect in all his ways gets 18%.  He would have got 20% plus if the rest of his team performed because even though the waiter was perfect he has to suffer a little, but HE/SHE still gets paid.  The wait staff should always be tipped regardless of the food quality or delivery time.  The wait staff relies on tips to earn a living.  

The air conditioning thing is troubling.  Maybe they just want people to eat more???  Virginia suggested we come back in the spring?  

Maybe...not even then."

We ordered their fried onion they call cactus something and it was so filling which resulted me getting my entrée packed.i ordered the pork chops it was seasoned right and cooked to perfection just one thing they should hold on to the salt a bit rest was great. Their chilly was great too with topping of onion and cheese made it more tasty I loved it and my second side was veggie steamed to perfection nice and tender. My husband ordered a bone in steak medium rare and they cooked that too perfection my husband got caesars salad and forgot to ask them for dressing on the side and Texas Roadhouse dresses the salad like no other the idea of having salad is kinda lost in so much dressing. But overall a good experience and oh they have very classic looking small metal bucket full of peanuts well roasted if you don&#39;t have peanut allergy go for it"

We used to eat here every New Years Day, but NYD 2014, they had issues opening their doors in a timely manner, so we went elsewhere. But our last visit, this past December, was the proverbial straw that broke the camel&#39;s back, and we swore to be done with this place.

I&#39;ve gotten the Dallas filet and the Filet Medallions, and both were alright. Nothing to write home about. The steak kabobs used to be my favorite, but the second time I had them, most of the meat was chewy and just plain disgusting.

For appetizers, the Blossom is alright and I love the Rattlesnake Bites. The Fried Pickles are just okay. Of course, those rolls with the cinnamon butter are good, but that&#39;s obvious and don&#39;t count as an appetizer, anyway.

On our last visit, I decided to try something new, so I chose the Smothered Chicken (no mushrooms, with the jack cheese topping). The dish was a joke. The cheese was terribly bland, the chicken tasted under-cooked, and the onions were so heavily covered in the tasteless cheese that their flavor was hardly detectable. For my sides, I chose double rice like usual,but this time it too was  bland, sticky, and pretty much rendered inedible. 
My husband went with his usual Dallas filet and side of chili. After placing our order, we noticed that there wasn&#39;t any silverware at our table.  Rather than wait for our waitress to return so we could request some, I just swiped a set from an empty booth a few seats away.

Our Rattlesnake Bites arrived in acceptable time but his chili took forever to be brought out, and when it did arrive, our entrees arrived two minutes after. Our waitress was very apologetic about the timing of the food being brought out, but an apology won&#39;t buy ten extra minutes to enjoy the appetizers and then wait for the main course.

Service has always been decent luckily, but that alone won&#39;t entice us to return. We boxed up our leftovers, which went into the trash the next morning for the dumpster squirrels to enjoy."

Food is always pretty consistent although I think their interpretation of medium rare is a little more medium than my liking. 

We come here and ask for Rhyan. He always takes really good care of us and we love his upbeat attitude. Very attentive and courteous from start to finish. I wish all the other people who worked here shared his enthusiasm. 

I give this place five starts for the consistency of the food and the excellent service from Rhyan. 

Unfortunately the other servers we have had there have not been all that great. We have had one of the older gentleman who was really rude and his apron and clothes were extremely dirty. Cannot remember his name for the life of me. We have also sat at the bar. The bartenders seem to have an attitude of indifference about them. 

The bottom line is if you find a server you like here; request them. Otherwise things can be a bit hit or miss. However, the food is quite good."

Except these rolls were a little better just because they serve it with cinnamon butter (which I was eating by the scoop lol) whereas Logan&#39;s only has regular butter.

The waiter immediately offered us an appetizer on the house so we ended up ordering the Bloomin Onion. For our entrees, my husband and I both ordered a sirloin. The steaks were flavorful and tender! The entrees come with 2 sides each and I ordered seasoned rice and sauteed mushrooms with mine. My husband ordered a loaded baked potato and steak fries with his. The sides were really good! I prefer the pilaf rice at Logan&#39;s over Texas Roadhouse&#39;s seasoned rice but it was still good. I ordered 3 kids meals for my children which were surprisingly big portions and also comes with sides. We ordered them the steak bites, rib basket, and macaroni and cheese (all kids meals). Everybody seemed happy about their meals and we were all super satisfied.

By the end of the meal, we got our check and noticed that they added the kids meals to our check but the price next to them were $0.00. I was surprised and mentioned it to the waiter and he said that kids actually eat free that day. I was a happy camper! 

Naperville is about a 25 mile drive from where we used to live in the Chicagoland area but the drive was definitely worth it for their delicious food and outstanding customer service!"

First off, they are a well oiled machine. We walked in and saw a huge crowd but I was happy to hear there was only a 5-15 minute wait even with a booth preference, nice. They have a crazy abundance of overly dramatic high school hostesses but they were all super friendly and on top of their game. Not to mention they were passing around samples of fried pickles while people were waiting. (They weren&#39;t the best)

We were taken to our table with the ever famous bread. This stuff is seriously crack. I could have just eaten that the whole time. It&#39;s hot and fresh, just amazing. 

Our waitress was awesome. I let her low that I signed up for their loyalty program a million times and haven&#39;t gotten my email coupon yet and she kindly checked with the manager. He declined the free appetizer, but it really isn&#39;t their fault. There should be a notice when you sign up that the coupon will take days to register. 

Anyhow, our waitress was full of honest opinions to help us decide what to order. We got the rattlesnake bites and I started with a Margarita Sangria. I probably wouldn&#39;t get either of those again. They were ok but a one time rodeo kinda deal.

I got the ribs which were awesome. The hype is right on those things. I got the loaded mashed potatoes, also fantastic and the ehh corn. 

The manager stopped by with a bag for peanuts to apologize about the delay for my free appetizer. He also included a coupon for the next visit. What great customer service!"

My husband&#39;s chicken fried steak must be great because he has ordered it every time we come here for many years!  The fresh rolls and cinnamon butter are a nice addition.

No drink order no refill on peanuts nothing? 2nd bartender takes drink order gets drinks walks away. 1st bartender comes back asks if we&#39;re eating takes appetizer and goes to next customer offers them rolls(not us) and we asked and he delivers. The whole night was very odd begging for refill on my beer, plates and silverware. Neither seemed to care more busy chatting with other managers and making drinks for tables. Don&#39;t serve dinner or food at the bar if you can&#39;t watch your rail and give good service.  This is the 3rd time of bad service with Jamie behind the bar.

I&#39;ve eaten here twice. Once by choice 10 yrs ago. Once by force just recently. 

First experience. I ordered a salad and got more than I bargained for. A HUGE dead fly in my salad. I complained to my server and asked for another. He told me the manager would come see me. Manager waltzed around the room, occasionally eyeing me. He was clearly sending me a message. 

He eventually made his way to me. His attitude still makes me laugh heartily to this day. He comped it, but with a very obvious belief that *I* put that fly in my salad to get it for free. No apology whatsoever for serving me food with a bug so big it looked like it could be put on a leash.  Is it hilarious or just completely insulting?!! Either way, he was an idiot. I swore I would NEVER step foot in this building again.

If only I could be that lucky..... Just recently I promised to take someone out to dinner for their bday. They chose Texas Roadhouse. Heaven. help. me. 

I cannot grasp why people love this place. The vegetables were soggy and swimming in oil. -It was &#34;Elementary school cafeteria  meets Junior High locker room&#34; . Sooooo nasty.

Why in heavens name did I order salmon from here? Because it looked like the healthiest thing on the menu. Plus, even 10 yrs later, I don&#39;t want a salad from here. Salmon: D R Y. Not. Good. People have admitted to me that they loathe salmon. I never understood how that could be possible. Suddenly, I understood. If *this* (or salmon comparable to it) was the only kind I&#39;d had... I would assuredly loathe it too. 

Rolls. It&#39;s only fair to admit that I am an excellent baker. I teach bread classes. I make it all. But specific to dinner rolls, I have been told many, many times that mine are the &#34;best rolls&#34; someone has ever eaten. Said by serious foodies and food snobs.  They really are the best. --it&#39;s not bragging if it&#39;s true, right? ;)

I took one bite of their rolls and didn&#39;t finish. If I&#39;m going to eat carbs like that, it sure as heck should be worth it. Anyone who raves about these... Come on over to my house. I&#39;ll school you. :)"

But a damned good one.
I hate all the silly Texas trappings, but I&#39;ve never ever had a duff meal, and I&#39;ve et at these places all over the US. Consistent, they are!
Point to anything on the Menu, and you can&#39;t go wrong. 
But here&#39;s my pick to click!: Look for the Kabobs on the Menu. They are mostly the trimmings from the Tenderloins they cut the Filets from. They&#39;re marinated in a tasty goo, and served with a nicely charred kabob of veggies. The Menu says it comes with Rice (which is fine) But I go with a Baker.  $10.99! 
As Eddie Murphy sez: &#34;What a bargain!&#34;
Now this ain&#39;t Gene and Georgetti&#39;s, folks, don&#39;t get me wrong.
But I&#39;m talking a tender and tasty Steak Dinner for not much more than a trip to Wendys. That&#39;s got to count for something.
And if you&#39;re hungry, you can add a second Steak Skewer for $6.99. Just under $18 for a Steak feed? Are you f&#39;ing kidding me?
The salads are good, although I wish they served a Wedge like Outback. All the rest of the sides are right there.
I should also menchen I am not a fan of Chicken Fingers. I call Chicken Fingers &#34;Food for people who don&#39;t like to eat&#34;
Well.
I&#39;ve actually ORDERED the Chicken Fingers at T.Roadhouse, they are that good.
There&#39;s an open kitchen where you can see the folks making the Biscuits and Grilling the steaks. What you don&#39;t see is the shpritz of seasoning that gets applied between the steak&#39;s time on the grill and your table. But don&#39;t worry-That&#39;s some tasty stuff they&#39;re adding.
If I had one complaint, it&#39;s the cinnamon butter they insist on sending out with the yeast rolls. The stuff would be great at breakfast, but I find it a little cloying. GARLIC butter, would be a much much much better option, which I&#39;d gladly duke up extra for if necessary. Otherwise, keep the spice and just send some plain butter out.
One more thing: the &#34;Throw&#34; (mix) of the fountain sodas here is great. Very quenching.
The service? Mostly a bevy of Collegiate Girls, and the kind of boys you&#39;d expect them to be hanging with. And they are snapping! Can&#39;t remember lousy service ever at one of their stores. (and the Naperville one,here is top of the walk!)
One more &#34;one more&#34; thing: If you&#39;re dining solo, the bar here (and all all the stores I&#39;ve visited) is a convivial place. Their cocktails are well-made, reasonably priced, and there&#39;s always a fine selection of Beers. It ain&#39;t a Wine mecca, but there&#39;s always a sturdy peasant Red to wash your Beef down with. 
A WAY better-than-average Place-To-Eat™...

It is so warm, soft, and sweet. I almost never eat bread but this one I always love! Also, I never eat onion rings but this place serves the best Bloomin Onion with a great (Thousand Island?) sauce. My dad always loves eating the peanuts too!

For the main dish, I usually get a 6 oz steak with steak fries and a baked potato. It&#39;s always a great dish! I always have leftovers after eating the bread and onion strings!

This place gets really crowded on Friday and Saturday nights so be prepared to stand in lines! I think you can call ahead though- not sure the exact process."

Very good service that included samples of three sides. I ordered the 20 ounce bone-in ribeye medium well done. The taste was out of this world but the steak was tough, which I didn&#39;t expect for the second  most expensive item on their menu. I let the server know when he came to ask how we liked our meal, but all he said was that it was because I ordered my steak medium well. There was no offer of any redress, but I soldiered on anyway. The mashed potatoes were absolutely out of this world! They were made the old-style way, lumpy and really tasty - very buttery, with cheese and bacon. I would definitely get that again. The corn was nothing special to write home about, but then I didn&#39;t expect it to be. Great rolls with cinnamon butter, and they were warm when they were served. Plentiful drinks, and they kept them coming. Despite the fact that my steak was tough, I would go back again."

We ordered a cowboy cut sirloin and a bone in ribeye. The sirloin was mild in taste but was juicy enough to enjoy. The ribeye was a disappointment. Obviously since the meat is a ribeye, it would be flavorful, but this particular cut has overly fatty and did not have enough seasoning. Could not taste any seasoning at all, not even salt. When I had cut out the fatty portions of the meat, I had about 1/4 of the steak cut out. That is a lot of fat for a ribeye from a quality steak.

The fresh baked bread was good and the price for beer ($5 a large mug) was great, but we came to eat good protein and the steak needed to be better. It did not help that the waitress made no real attempt to come by our table unless we called them over by stopping her as she walked by or when an opportunity to sell more beer was apparent."

The chili is a little on the salty side and presented with a bunch of raw shredded cheese on top along with a bunch of raw red onions.  It&#39;s a little much,  they can heat it up a little or something.  Wendy does basically the same thing but somehow most of the rawness is removed and some cheese is melted. 

They cooked the life right out of the beans and it was pretty salty.   The steak was a little bland so it was actually well matched.  The steak was actually cooked perfectly to order which I wasn&#39;t expecting.   

All in all its a solid place to go get a casual steak meal."

For starters, I was very nervous that we were in for an hour plus wait given that it was a holiday and we had no reservations.  No issues though, I did use the call ahead service and was quoted a time 30 minutes away which gave us just enough time to get there.  When we got there, there were people waiting but we gave our confirmation number and were seated immediately.  Whatever they are doing with that wait system works.

It took a little longer for our waitress Tekila to come take our order, but it was crazy busy so she gets a pass.  Plus she was super friendly and funny - we loved her.  We put in our orders and after I finished my first drink she informed me that something had happened with their water? and wasn&#39;t able to refill my sweet tea.  I told her that I&#39;d like a cherry limeade instead, but she didn&#39;t want to have to charge me for a non-refillable drink.  So instead she made me her own version of a cherry limeade: sprite, cherry grenadine and limes - AWESOME.  

As far as the food, great.  We got fresh, warm bread promptly.  We both got steaks cooked to perfection, sides that were awesome and left completely satisfied. For a holiday, this restaurant was on top of its game."

I want to give it a try and gather a birthday dinner with my friends.  I called yesterday and made reservation with a lady for today at 5:00pm for 11 people.  My experience today was absolutely awful. 

When I checked in at the front desk, the girl asked my confirmation number.  I told her i did not receive any confirmation number from the girl who spoke to me yesterday.  Then she asked my name and how many people.  She looked up her computer and she cannot find any information about my reservation.  Then i have been told that someone called them this morning for table of eleven but they told the guest they never take reservation.  I told the girl I did not call this morning but i called yesterday at 5:58pm. I checked my phone calling history and make sure i called the right place.  Then I told the girl I called yesterday evening and talked to the girl who told me all set after i made the reservation, after that I told her this is for birthday.  Then she told me to call back tomorrow (today) to remind them.  I told her I will remind the waiter/waitress and i will not call back tomorrow.  I will be there at 5. She said alright. Then the reception girl told me to wait and she needs to find her manager.  While I wait there, there are so many girls work at front and they looked at me like I&#39;m the one who made the mistake.  This was very poor service and no respect at all.  

The manager came after 5 minutes and she told me the girl who made reservation did told me they never make reservation and told me to call back today.  i told the manager my side story.  The manager told me we are on their list but they need to split our table cause their biggest table only fit 8 people.  I was very upset and disappointed.

The things that separate Texas Roadhouse from the other steakhouses, or at least the ones that I have been to, are the peanuts and the cinnamon butter and buns. You can nibble on peanuts as you are waiting to be seated and then once you are seated you can nibble on more peanuts. Now if you feel like you have eaten a jar of peanut butter from eating a lot of peanuts while waiting for your food then they also leave you a basket of buns and cinnamon butter. The cinnamon butter is just phenomenal and the buns are just.....well.....buns. The only thing that I am a little disappointed about is the lack of attention to details. With the last two times that my wife and I have been to this location they have cooked the right cuts of steak to our liking but they would put my steak with my wifes meal and my wifes steak with my meal. They should invest in doing some kind of color coding system to indicate how each cut of meat is cooked instead of trying to remember which plate gets what.

Our waitress was very nice, competent and checked on us several times, despite the fact that it was suepr busy. 

I would definitely come back to feed my meat craving, since I´m usually not a big steak person. I had a sirloin and it was very tasty but quite chewy. I tried my friends ribeye and it was very good, so I would take this the next time I come in.
I especially enjoyed the spiced rice I had as one of my sides. It gave the meat a nice additional flavor.

I also recommend their strawberry margarita, yumm,yumm,yumm"

Bre was our server this time. She did an excellent job! Not surprising though,  that&#39;s how it is every time we visit. I do like their happy hour menu.

When they first opened the management was very concerned about their food and service. This time, not so much. My wife&#39;s steak came out undercooked. We sent it back and the manager brought the re-cooked steak out to make sure it was fine. I mentioned to him that my chili came out three times at an unacceptable temperature. He offered to make it warm, but I don&#39;t want a microwaved bowl of chili, I want my chili to be hot because the pot of chili is kept at an acceptable temperature. He said he would check on the chili. Previous management would have either comp&#39;ed the meal, or at least offered a dessert. This time nothing. And my wife&#39;s steak turned out to be very dry, even though it was supposed to be med-well. The rolls are great, but that won&#39;t bring me back.

I realize that we&#39;re in Naperville a there is, in fact, a Texas Roadhouse somewhere in Naperville and I haven&#39;t been to one in about 5 years so I know this is where I want to go. 

As we&#39;re leaving the hospital, I call for call ahead seating, which I HIGHLY recommend. It got us on the list. Took about 10 minutes to get there after my phone call to them and we only had to wait about 10 minutes once we actually arrived, total SCORE! Nice waiting area, minus the floor covered in peanut shells, but that&#39;s part of the charm. There is a barrel, yes, a barrel of peanuts smack dab in the middle of the waiting area. You can snack while you wait. My husband of course, loved this! It was like being at a Cubs game: break the shell, take the nuts, release the shell. My one suggestion is give those hostesses a tray of waters to offer to people. There is a large group of hostesses standing around. Literally doing nothing but waiting for a table to seat. This may be a better use of their time and make the whole experience a little nicer for the guests. Just a thought. 

Our pager lights up and vibrates, our hostess grabs a basket of something from the kitchen on her way to seat us and off we go! 

This place is totally family and large group friendly. No question that people come here for the atmosphere and the food. It&#39;s fun and interactive and makes for a great spot to bring the kids. Their noise just blends in with the other 150 people in the whole place chatting away. A lot of birthdays...they bring around a saddle and make you straddle it while they announce to the whole place that it&#39;s so-and-so&#39;s birthday, and we all do a big &#34;YA---HOO&#34; for the birthday guy or gal.  It can be a little distracting but in all honesty, it&#39;s that kind of place: fun and loud and gets people in a good mood. Even the older couple at the table next to us, clapped for them and did a yahoo or two. See? Its that kind of place. 

Our server, Jena, loved her!! She&#39;s new to the area and worked at TR in another state previously. She knows the restaurant, knows the menu, and that girl was on top of refills like white on rice. Well done, Jena! We&#39;ll be requesting you on our next visit. Such a sweet gal. 

So, about that basket the hostess grabbed earlier...I had almost forgotten! They have these warm rolls they serve with...wait for it....this creamy cinnamon butter that just glides onto the bread as if it they were meant for each other. Not gonna lie, it&#39;s really hard to just have one. You really need to have at least 2. The best things in life come in pairs...so two of these rolls just makes sense. 

We skipped the apps because in all honesty, you get two sides with each entree and with the bread, that&#39;s simplytoo much food. For us, at least.

I really wanted a steak but the pulled pork and chicken combo grabbed my attention, so I opted for that and I ate a steak vicariously through by husband who ordered a bone-in ribeye per my suggestion. So I actually got to taste the steak I would have ordered if I hadn&#39;t got the combo so it worked out. I got the chili as one of my sides and it had a lot of meat. Surprisingly so. They also will give you onions and cheese if you&#39;d like. I just got the cheese. It was quite yummy! The chicken was a butterflied breast and the pulled pork was tender and had a nice flavor. The steak was excellent!! A nice thick cut steak and sooooo flavorful. I barely ate my dinner after the rolls and the chili so I have plenty of leftovers in the fridge and they WILL be eaten!

We will be back. I really enjoy all Naperville has to offer, so this will be a regular stop for us when we&#39;re in the area. Next time, I&#39;m going for the steak, and maybe I&#39;ll skip the chili so I can enjoy a little more of my entree."

I was far from impressed. We started with the fried pickles. They were so thin they were almost potato chips. The ribs and the steak were good. The country fried chicken was not good. The grilled mushrooms for the steak were super salty. Our waiter was nice but I had to keep reminding him of things he forgot ( my sons steak fries and his shrimp) and he dropped my sons plate so they had to remake everything for him. The Jamaican Cowboy margarita tasted like a fuzzy navel. After spending $120 I probably will not return.

My favorite is definitely the bread and sometimes I come here just for the bread...actually a lot of times :). The steak is good.  I usually get the 11 ounce sirloin. I&#39;ve also gotten their ribs and cheeseburgers and sliders and pulled pork sandwiches.  The sliders usually come out very well done almost burnt.  The ribs are ok but still not as good as Portillos. Their burgers are good but still not as good as other places.  The salads are usually fresh but nothing outstanding.  Their pulled pork is pretty good.  The service is usually very good and I never have to wait too long.  The place is clean but peanuts everywhere since they have them lying around on all the tables so don&#39;t come here if you have a peanut allergy.  Cost is reasonable.  I guess after reading my review I should have gone with 3 stars but I just love their bread so much I think it&#39;s worth 4 stars :)

Got there around 1:15 and the place was packed. We got to the restaurant about 10 minutes late and the kids had already gotten a table. They had been given rolls and butter but even with us being late there was still no silverware or plates for the rolls on the table. 

The waitress was really friendly and took our drink order and brought our tea and water quickly. When she finally brought the small plates they looked a little wet and grungy with water drops and what I&#39;m guessing is caked on old food residue. We wiped down the cleanest ones and my boyfriend didn&#39;t use one at all.

I had a coupon for a free appetizer from joining their email list, so we ordered a blossom. It came out to us in a pretty timely manner. The blossoms tasted a little underdone as the onions were still somewhat hard but everyone else thought they were fine. 

We ordered entrees next. My boyfriend had the beef tips with mashed potatoes and mushrooms and onion. His daughter had the grilled chicken salad and her husband had the half slab of ribs. I only had a baked potato with the works. 

The beef tips were so good. Awesome comfort food! The gravy was very savory and the steak perfectly cooked and tender. Only comment would be there was a boatload of mushrooms and not enough steak. Everyone always wants more steak!

The grilled chicken salad was excellent with a good ratio of lettuce to fixins, generous portion of chicken, and the honey mustard dressing was very tasty.

The ribs were falling off the bone, cooked to perfection. 

My baked potato was good too but the potato was huge and the amount of sour cream on it was not nearly enough. If you like sour cream ask for extra from the get go.

We&#39;ll be back! Hopefully they will have that little dishwashing quality issue taken care of!"

I&#39;m not a huge steak guy, but remembering their inability to disentangle the huge mystery of knowing the difference between medium-rare and medium-well still annoys me. And am I expecting too much for a steakhouse to serve at least a palatable burger? I&#39;d chose a Whopper over what they gave me any day of the week. Sorry, but this place is not my cup of tea.

This place is way too overpriced for what it is. During dinner hours, you always have to wait at least 10-15 minutes even when you call ahead of time. Retarded. The shades that cover the lighting are decorated with beer logos. Classy. It&#39;s really loud in the restaurant and whenever it&#39;s someone&#39;s birthday, the waiters and waitresses are required to scream YEEEEHAWWW. Annoying ! Also, there are ALWAYS peanut shells all over the f***ing floor too ! Filthy ! 

I mean I don&#39;t know what I expected out of a restaurant with a name like Texas Roadhouse, but it should be illegal for a place this tacky to charge more than $7 for an entree. Don&#39;t get me wrong though, the food and the service are both pretty good, but the prices just don&#39;t add up with the atmosphere. Did I mention that the employees all wear shirts that say &#34;I love my job&#34;. LMAO, I highly doubt that even 30% of them do.

In conclusion, this would be a great place to hold a Ku Klux Klan gathering, an NRA fundraiser, or maybe a republican national convention screening party !!

I worked at the East Peoria Texas Roadhouse for a few years in college. Since then, I&#39;ve gone to many Texas Roadhouse restaurants, and they all look EXACTLY the same on the inside. And, you get the exact same food, no matter what. So, to say I love the East Peoria one would mean that I love ALL of them.

One nice thing about this place is that they truly, TRULY do make all their food in house. If nothing has changed since 2007, then the only things they do not make there are the low fat ranch dressing and their apple pie. But literally, everything is from scratch, which is great. If you have ever worked for a chain restaurant before, you know that made-from-scratch items are harder to find in this realm.

Their chicken critters are off the chain. Seriously, how can a chicken strip dipped in ranch taste so heavenly? It&#39;s insane. If you get the Critter Salad, it&#39;s basically the same experience and you can feel better about yourself. 

They dip their steak in butter and season it, like any other place. But it&#39;s dang good, for the price. Their steaks range between $7.99 to somewhere around $20ish, and that includes sides. You will pay triple that price at Ruth&#39;s Chris, just for the steak. Is it just as good? No, but its still really, really good. This place always has a wait for a reason...affordable but delicious steak. I mean, Applebee&#39;s has a cheap steak, but are people waiting out the door for it? Nope. There&#39;s a reason people come here.

Pretty much everything here is good except for the low fat ranch dressing and the pork chops. Don&#39;t get the pork chops. Seriously, don&#39;t. They are dry and awful.

One con about this particular location is that their high school kids that are working the carry-out room are usually flirting or on their phones. I get it, guys. You are basically locked in the belltower of the restaurant, away from the action and from your other host friends. But for the 5-6 times an hour that someone comes in to get their carry-out, PLEASE pay attention and smile :)"

Not sure how they are giving you a degree for majoring in surfing the internet, but oh well, I am getting one for texting....kidding!

We showed up, and since our party was large, we were split into two booth, which I didn&#39;t mind, but I am sure the people who had to sit with my dad and grandma, who are both really quirky (IE weird), were irked, again, I kid.

The bread they give you looked really good, as well as the cinnamon butter. I wasn&#39;t an idiot and filled up on that, as long as peanuts, but I had to wait for my meal. I decided on sirloin steak with onions and mushrooms, plus a house salad and baked beans. Yes, two sides, in addition to an entree, plus the bread and peanuts. Texas Roadhouse? More like Texas Madhouse...so much food!

The variety of dishes ordered were shrimp, sirloin kabobs, burgers, and sandwiches. Also, sides were ordered, such as potatoes (sweet, mashed, baked, loaded). You would think we would shut the place down. There was so much food!

Yes, you can eat sensibly here, but it would be very difficult without that willpower, I will admit! I would go back! 

&#34;Oh no, it&#39;s a chain&#34;....So you&#39;re saying you can&#39;t get a decent steak at a &#34;chain&#34;? I disagree, and shame on you for thinking you&#39;re better than me because I like chain restaurants."

Cinnamon butter on dinner roll! You can&#39;t go wrong with eating at Texas Roadhouse. There is a reason why you have to wait 1 hour to be seated at this restaurant. While you are waiting, you get to eat unlimited peanuts which you can shell and throw on the floor. The meat they use for the steaks are excellent grade full of flavor and the season is just right. At least from my experience the steaks are cooked to perfection. They come with 2 sides (i prefer my chili and mashed potatos). If you don&#39;t want steak, they have one of the best salmon dishes that is cheaper than Red lobster. To complement the meal, you get unlimited warm fresh dinner rolls with a healthy slab of cinnamon butter. I downed a whole basket by myself during my last trip. 

Pro: cinnamon butter dinner rolls, unlimited peanuts, bargain price, flavorful steak

Cons: excessive long wait times

Hidden gem: 
- Make sure you do the call ahead seating which cuts down on your wait time
- Take a bag of peanuts for home
- Signup for the email club on the website for a free appetizer
- Unlimited dinner rolls with delicious cinnamon butter"

I frequent this restaurant with my mother all the time and we receive good if not spectacular service. Our waitress, Shelby, was not up to par. The first five minutes when we came in was one of the few times we saw her until my mom made her rush back and forth to make sure we received everything we needed. She never came back to ask us if we needed refills or more rolls or anything. I did notice she would frequent the larger table behind us and would constantly ask if they had everything and bend over backwards for them. By the time out food came we were quite confused because he hadn&#39;t even received our salads. When she came back her automatic excuse was they had lost the ticket. I highly doubt if we had gotten our food our ticket couldn&#39;t have been &#34;lost.&#34; At the end of the night I begged my mom not to leave anything because of how horrible I felt it was.

I showed up at 8pm and waited almost 30 minutes for a table. The atmosphere is very laid-back and relaxed. There are many TVs surrounding the bar playing sports games, adding to the laid-back persona of this place. The noise level is about average, despite the high number of birthday parties that were there when I hit up this place. 

This place is known for their steaks, but I opted for their country fried chicken since it was getting old and I was craving some hearty comfort food. From the beginning though, the warm bread and their cinnamon butter really hits the spot. I also recommend ordering the fried pickle appetizer. As for the main meal, the country friend chicken with the &#34;white sauce&#34; was what I was craving for the night. The serving sizes are a bit on the larger side, but what can you expect from a restaurant with &#34;Texas&#34; in its&#39; name? The prices are very reasonable so I have no reason to gripe about this place. 

They also provide unlimited peanuts. You will enjoy this place even more if you enjoy country music. Despite having a bar here, people do not get out of hand here.

Cheers."

She was the friendliest girl. Excellent. Checked how everything was and went over specials. My only negative, the food was served by a &#34;runner&#34;, as I call them, my grilled shrimp were &#34;cool&#34; ,so I&#39;m wondering if order was ready &amp; he wasn&#39;t. She did say she would delete off bill. So that was a plus on her part also. Previous posts, I was surprised by negatives. We called ahead &amp; were given number &amp; waited just 5-7 minutes before being seated. Steak was tasty &amp; fried pickle chips were great."

Placed our order, and our server brought us the wrong drinks - apologized saying she must have given our drinks to another table (so I guess someone else&#39;s service was poor today too).  We order our meals, 2 of which required a side of broccoli.  When our food finally arrived, it was missing and our server told us it would be up shortly.  We finished our meal, and no broccoli.  We asked the server when she finally returned, and she said she had been fighting with the kitchen all day to get what she needed for orders.  I called the manager, Joe,  over to the table to let him know that our service was rough today.  He shows up with the broccoli in hand, after we had paid the bill and were packing up to leave.  He says &#34;What&#39;s the problem?&#34;  We share our experience and mention that we are otherwise engaged customers who have had terrible service today.  He didn&#39;t seem to think an inaccurate or incomplete order was cause for alarm.  I shared with him that I was informing him that the wheels were coming off in the kitchen and with the wait staff today so that he might be in a position to do something about it.  His reaction was patronizing and rude.  Our business is in no way valued by this new restaurant manager.  Our past experiences at this location were not like this - this new manager needs to go back for basic training on customer service management."

I know it&#39;s a chain, and the worst kind of chain puts the name of a city or state in its name. It&#39;s like they are telling folks, &#34;Eat here, it&#39;s just like you&#39;re eating in a Texas Roadhouse&#34;. It&#39;s like they&#39;re just setting themselves up for failure because there will always be someone (like the snob in me) that will say, &#34;Well, I HAVE eaten in a real Texas Roadhouse and blah, blah, blah...&#34; you get the picture. 

It took a visiting friend of mine to see the error of my ways. She had just moved to Alaska and was telling me about all the things she misses from the &#34;lower 48&#34; and she sighed as we drove past Texas Roadhouse....well, she being one of my best friends, we HAD to stop there for lunch. 

We had a great lunch. There&#39;s a bucket of peanuts on the table to snack on while you decide what to order. I guess you can throw the shells on the floor, but they did have an extra bucket for shells if you didn&#39;t feel like littering. They also gave some warm bread rolls with cinnamon butter which was really, really good. Between the peanuts and bread rolls, we did not feel the need to order appetizers (but the list really looked good too) 

I ordered the 6oz filet, medium, and it was cooked perfectly. It was also seasoned well that there wasn&#39;t any need for steak sauce. There wasn&#39;t any steak sauce on the table anyway--pretty confident that folks wont need it, and to me, they are right on! There are a lot of sides you can choose between baked potato, baked sweet potato, fries, side salad, steamed veggies. The salad is pretty basic--iceberg lettuce, carrots, cucumbers. The baked potato was just basic as well.  

Service was really good. I think our server could tell that me and my friend had a lot to talk about so he really didn&#39;t interrupt us to ask how we were doing, he walked past many times and would glance and smile at us. You know, that unspoken dance between diner and server letting each other know that all is well. 

The decor is Texas kitschy, road signs, wood everywhere, nice big bar in the center. What I found was great spot that I&#39;d definitely visit again."

Tender, meaty, juicy, and so GOOD! You can choose your fillet and choose your size of fillet. Hubby got the 8 oz and I got the 6 oz petit filet mignon. Also, their bread here is DELICIOUS!!! it&#39;s a sweat roll and buttery bread that comes hot table side and honestly, it&#39;s the BEST bread i&#39;ve ever had probably. (beware, it&#39;s probably so bad for you. . . haha) 

The waiter&#39;s here are very nice and totally will help you out with the menu if you have any questions. 

The only reason I didn&#39;t give this restaurant a 5 is because although, I love the food here, if you come here, do NOT expect to eat a healthy meal. . . haha. . . you gotta be in the mood for it. =)

This place is about comfort and food over anything else. Are you looking for ridiculous amounts of potatoes and a huge slab of meat? You got it! You want to eat peanuts by the bucketful and throw the shells on the floor? Live it up!

My man&#39;s meat (giggle) was perfection. He asked for medium and it came out just as it should have. We shared the bread basket and their shrimp skewer appetizer. Both were delicious. Their sweet butter creeps me out a little. It&#39;s definitely an acquired taste. My prime rib was medium rare, but it wasn&#39;t the best cut or my favorite seasoning. I&#39;m not saying it was bad, but I think I&#39;ll take this one from the South and pass it back to the Italians."

The last time I went here was my worst experience and I haven&#39;t been back since. My waiter forgot about us and took almost 15 mins to order a drink and app. Then we order the combo plate with steak/ chicken. My steak I wanted medium,but got extra well done. Plus they forgot to bring our appetizer before our dinner and didn&#39;t offer to do anything for us! That&#39;s crap! Plus the lady next to us was going off about her food being wrong and over cooked. My one pet peeve is going to a steak house and they mess up the steak!!!

The take out is dreadful - multiple times they have missed orders or forgotten items or added toppings to a salad that were specifically not requested.

When you call to complain, you&#39;ll get a &#34;manager&#34; telling you they will send you something in the mail (nothing arrives), presumably a coupon or discount.  When I approached the &#34;manager&#34; about this recently during another take out order, he told me he was not the acting manager and would talk to the real manager and &#34;get back to me&#34;

The food was acceptable, but apparently the kitchen and wait staff have not been trained to pace a meal when appetizers are ordered first, and especially when salads also need to be served prior to the main course.  ALL courses ended up being crammed onto the table together, and my husband ended up eating his salad for dessert, since he did not want his steak to get cold. 

(Note: we also had a coupon for a free appetizer, and at first the server was going to challenge us as to whether or not the coupon would be honored, which I thought was very bad form.  Servers need to be trained better in customer service.  It should also be noted that this same server spilled gravy on me as he was clearing the table (accidents happen, and we all make mistakes, but no one at the restaurant even offered to pay for dry cleaning, which would have been the appropriate response.)      

The tables are much too close together (the wait staff can just barely squeeze between them to deliver food), the music is EXTREMELY loud, and the metal buckets sitting on the tables (presumably for peanuts?-- I don&#39;t know for sure, since our server just ignored them) looked as if people had been using them as little trash containers, which was gross.  

It was also disgusting to be handed a glass of wine with lipstick stains all around the rim; apparently neither the bartender nor the server noticed it, but I sure did-- I despise lipstick for exactly that reason: it sticks to everything.  But, it also showed that the proper amount of attention is not being given to ensuring that the bar glasses are washed well, and it seems that the bartenders have not been trained to inspect the glasses for lipstick, water spots, etc. PRIOR to pouring and serving drinks. 

(Note: I was credited for the first glass of wine, after ordering a second).  

There was also a talented young male going from table to table to perform card tricks and make balloon animals, which was entertaining, but seemed a bit awkward and out of place in a steakhouse; particularly when he was going up to tables full of ALL adults and NO children!  In my opinion, he would be more at home at Chuck E. Cheese, or some other venue geared toward young children.  He willingly accepted tips at each table that he visited, but I felt sorry for those who were not prepared to do so, because I am certain that they felt embarrassed.  Perhaps it would be a better idea to have the young man stationed in a given area, and then have any interested children approach him, rather than having the table-to-table visitation?  

In summary, the food was edible, but nothing to rave about, and the atmosphere left much to be desired in regard to comfort, cleanliness, and noise level.  Needless to say- with all of the restaurant choices out there- this one needs to step up its game in order to stay competitive!"

Though I am not a huge fan of the roadhouse concept, the number of patrons sporting Duck Dynasty knit caps (yes, while sat at a table) and camo suggested the concept could hold its own in this location. 
The two stars I am giving are for 1) the side salads all looked and tasted good, and 2) one star is earned by even the crappiest of restaurants. 
My imagination was this place was like what Lone Star was like. It was closer to Sizzler. 
We had a larger party, 10 people, so I saw a variety of entrees.  I ordered a bone in ribeye, very pedestrian. I could have been gnawing on this same quality piece of meat at the county fair.  The prime rib cuts that were ordered all looked good, but keep in mind this entree can be had at most Sunday buffets at the same quality level.  A couple of chicken dishes looked okay (a touch dry), but when I think Texas, I plan on ordering steak.  Baked potatoes were underdone and the other sides were cafeteria quality.   The main seasoning is salt and it is used with a heavy touch, most likely to cover up the less than restaurant cuts.  You can easily get better beef at you local Jewel and have a better meal at home.  However, you go out to eat so you don&#39;t have to cook a meal.  You go out for service, which this place also falls short on.  
As other reviewers mentioned, the servers all wear shirts that state &#34;I love my job,&#34; which means management knows otherwise. The two servers that serviced our party needed to read their shirts more.  Our bill was around $250, which would mean about a $50 dollar tip for excellent service. They just did not care enough to realize this.  Poor knowledge of the menu and lack of attentiveness.  Maybe my Duck Dynasty sweatshirt suggest they&#39;d only get 10 bucks regardless of how well they performed.  
I do not need to give this place a second try."

It is similar to a fast casual concept where you order at a counter and they bring the food to you.  You are basically deciding how you want your chicken - there are meals, sandwiches, salads and even some veggie options.  I went with a 1/4 dark chicken meal and the Nando fries on the side.  Both were fabulous and both were made more awesome by adding the Nando sauces that they provide.

The chicken as flavorful and not dry. I loved the different sauces. The fries and mayo were also tasty.

The chicken was good. Well cooked. Had a deep flavor of the lemon and herbs. It was a unique flavor. But it was nothing that blew me away. The fries came with a seasoned mustard sauce. Now THAT was something to try. I almost wanted a bottle of that stuff to take home. 
The macho peas were essentially seasoned peas. They were a bit spicy but nothing too intense. I then finished my meal with the tart. That was good too. I just wish they were bigger. 

The staff was nice and our order arrived fairly quickly. Though I don&#39;t feel they prepared us properly in how to navigate getting our food or utensils, napkins, etc. only cause it looks like a fancy restaurant, but you do most of that stuff (like get your own soda refills) yourself. 

Speaking of looks, the restaurant is fancy and has a very urban yet relaxed atmosphere. Kinda homey actually. 

Not sure if I&#39;ll ever go out of my way to go back here, but for what it was I enjoyed it. Might be a good place for a group outing or game night."
nandos-peri-peri-naperville-8,Shannon M.,H32QTRV87Q6CGTVUm1Z4QA,"Naperville, IL",1,1,0,119,20,MjC7oT1HfKKT3NNocQGzpA,3.0,2016-07-10,"So, I have eaten here three more times since my first review: once upstairs with a friend, once as take-out, and once on the patio with the gentleman from my first review. I have to say, Nando&#39;s has good food, but they fall short on portion size and just general confusion with their ordering setup.

The Upstairs Experience (visit #2): 

Gal pal and I opted to eat upstairs because I had the first time. Unfortunately we were second-class citizens when it came to being able to order certain things; she could only get iced tea downstairs? They only had cookies downstairs? And apparently this meant WE had to go downstairs to get them, because you order at the counter. How about having some brought up, if you have two places to order?? 

On the bright side this time, my wrap had a great amalgam of flavors with the chili jam and yogurt sauce, and didn&#39;t fall apart. Her chicken sandwich was flavorful and &#34;not super value but money&#39;s worth&#34; with a good bun.

Takin&#39; It To The Streets (to-go, visit #3): 

I opted for the Nutty Date Chicken Salad, (dates, almonds, pickled onions, goat cheese and honey dressing with chicken), but the pickled onions swamped this salad: the flavor was so strong that it really wiped out everything else. I would try the salad again but definitely eschew the onions next time. 

Back Porch (visit #4):

Yesterday was a warm sunny day, so the gentleman and I opted to dine on Nando&#39;s back patio. Some of the tables have umbrellas, and then there&#39;s a section with a trellis that could really benefit from having a fabric cover, because at midday you would be scorched sitting at those tables. Our table was perfectly screened from the sun by the angle of our umbrella, but some girls behind us swapped tables (to the confusion of the server, since your meal delivery is based on table #) to get out of the direct rays. 

I will say this was the time when I felt like I got the least bang for my buck. He got what was supposed to be two chicken thighs and they were pretty scrawny (see pics); likewise the spindly wing on my 1/4 chicken. We have both learned that the secret is to order &#34;plainish&#34; and then add the sauces yourself (I like the lemon herb).

The sides we got (grilled corn on the cob and garlic bread) were really good (especially the bread!), and the pineapple lemonade I ordered was divine (though the girl at the counter didn&#39;t fill up my glass, and for $3.25 you&#39;d better top that up, dammit). 

Ordering this time was also kind of a mess: we were on the lower level, and a whole bunch of people were just clustered by the counter, which has several registers. Some people were still looking at menus, but they all seemed to be queuing to one register. Meanwhile there was one girl who was open to the side. We went to her and asked if she was available. She said yes. Okay, then why wasn&#39;t she calling people over from the queue? We just cut the line. Whatever. 

I didn&#39;t care for the pushiness when a waiter/busboy was trying to clear our plates (when there were only two occupied tables on the patio) when I had only finished half my food! (My bf was done, but I am much slower.) &#34;Are you finished with your plates?&#34; NO!! Use your eyes! (I also really wanted to hurl at the kid wearing the corporate-approved &#34;I make the chicks hot&#34; shirt. Cheesy.) 

Overall, the food is the plus here, but service is kind of scatterbrained and it&#39;s a bit overpriced (but, it is Naperville). I do like the variety of menu options. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be back, but hopefully as time goes on they&#39;ll smooth out more and more."

And I never thought I would eat it again unless I make my travels back to the UK but luckily, they are opened all over Chicagoland!

I would always get a half a chicken ($13) or share a whole chicken ($27) with a buddy. Flavor wise, I would just stick with medium and dip it in the other sauces while I eat. I would recommend their garlic one or the mango-lime if you want a bit of a sweeter sauce to your chicken. 

The pricing is a bit high for chicken but the portion is really big and it&#39;s about 1.5-2 meals for me.

As for the sides, I enjoy their mashed potatoes, fries, or the rice, all are good and solid sides.

This place is two story and you get to pick where you want to sit and they&#39;ll bring the food out to ya. I love the decorations at all the Nando&#39;s restaurants, it&#39;s very artsy and colorful.

Free parking all around the block!"

From inaugural visits to this chain&#39;s WESS LOOP location I was hooked. Naperville offers more of the same: tasty grilled chicken with BOLD sauces and &#34;sabroso sides.&#34; It&#39;s all a little pricey; I&#39;d call it hyper-value-added-chicken. My smallish quarter breast with 2 sides ran $11. I could probably buy a bottle of NPP sauce and a whole chicken and make something approximating this at home. But we live in convenience society now, don&#39;t we?

The peas with mint and other ghoulash are excellent and the hyper green appeals to my eyebuds and fits with the colorful Afro-Caribe (not sure what nation NPP represents really) theme of the locations. Tried the mashed last night too and it was rich and caloric. Nom!

Get some!"

If you&#39;ve never had Nando&#39;s, where have you been? Well I think what makes them special is their 24 hour marinate to the bone secret sauce.  Then you have all kinds of ridiculous amount of sauce ranging from garlic to lemon to extra extra extra extra hot.  They&#39;re all made of the same base sauce they just add their different kick to it.  Obvi, have their chicken when you come here because chicken is life!  And then their fries... what can I say?  Don&#39;t forget the perinaise, yes, pay that extra fee to have it.  

So yes, 5 stars for this joint.  Why? The place is clean and it is located in the middle of Naperville downtown where a pig can be a pig.  Surrounded with other local and chain restaurants suited to please anyone.  The service was superb, as long as you have the humor to be berated (in a humorous way of course), but then again I enjoy a banter now and then.  The chicken and fries are to die, their dessert is heaven, and the sauce is like Jesus juice.  Around $10 for a meal so yeah, good value! 

Peri Peri get in my belly!!!"

Naperville desperately needs some super cute foodie places, and I was hoping this would fit the bill. The interior design at Nando&#39;s is absolutely darling and feels like the city. But MAN, there&#39;s some serious work needed on their service level... All the employees seemed distant and unfriendly, plus made me feel that I was using some sketchy coupon and trying to scam them, even though it was from corporate and sent to my email (BOGO on new menu items). They sent the manager out, who sort of helped me, but not in a cheery way. 

On to the food. We ordered the thigh skewers and the quinoa salad. Both definitely tasty, though not revolutionary. The chicken is obviously what to eat here, and the sauces are good. Prices seem a bit excessive, and it was kinda scary to watch the kitchen guy just scoop mashed potatoes and mashed peas out of a container near the floor and plop it on plates as they went past. Freshness might be an issue there. I tried not to think about it.

We will likely be back in hopes that this is just newness jitters and that they work out the kinks. But my expectations will be low going in..."

Great selection of sides. They have a nice outdoor deck, decent indoor seating on multiple levels. It does get packed at night for dinner on the weekends so plan accordingly.

The food quality is good.  The hot is hot.  It packs a bang.  From the appetizer olives (for $ of course) to the chicken dishes to the sides, the quality is good.  Salads are very good.  Be careful though.  Don&#39;t order the corn on the cob it it&#39;s not in season.  I had it two nights ago and it was like eating niblet corn.

The food portions are small particularly the chicken dishes.  My mother in law had the chicken leg.  It looked like it came from a hen.  Maybe a quail.  I had wings the first time I went there. Quality was good but sizes were small.

Service is puzzling.  Place your own order.  Get your own drinks.  When the meal is delivered, they ask if you want anything else.  Yes -- how about silverware, napkins, hot sauce?  The server will point out where you can get them.  Some will offer to get it for you.  But if you decide to get these items yourself, you&#39;ll likely pass the servers congregating in the hallway.

Value is less than average.  If you get a glass of wine or a beer, plan on $15 - $18 per person.  Three of us went there the other night.  Two had an alcoholic beverage.  The third had water.  One appetizer (olives) was ordered.  $55 in total.

Oh, one other point pertaining to the Naperville location.  If you need to go the restroom, you better give yourself a 10 minute head start.  There&#39;s only one toilet downstairs for men and one  for women."

And it worked, because I was insanely curious what it was all about. Portuguese? South African? Chicken? Interesting. When I saw it had finally opened, I bookmarked it here (though not easily, because Yelp says this location is in Chicago when it&#39;s definitely not. Anyway, one Sunday evening my husband and I wanted to go to Hugo&#39;s, but they&#39;d closed early, so instead we wandered over to Nando&#39;s to investigate.

The space is very cool and I can&#39;t remember what was there before, but I like what they&#39;ve done with it. Tall ceilings and colorful decor. When we walked in, the sign said to wait to be seated. So we watched the staff play on their phones and chit chat until someone noticed us and walked us to a table with menus. The ordering is weird here. You sit at a table and decide what you want, go up to the counter and order, then head back to the table to wait for your food. We both decided to try the chicken, I got fries with peri peri mayo, and my husband got peas. I ordered a frozen yogurt as well because I was worried it&#39;d be a super spicy meal. With two sodas, it was $38. Not expensive, but not exactly Panera prices, either.

We sat and waited for our chicken. We had arrived about an hour before closing, so I get that things were winding down, but man nobody was doing anything save for the cooks trying to grill up our food. The employees were all gathered around tables chatting and hanging out. Finally our food came and we dug in. I ordered mine plain because the menu emphasizes all the zestiness that the food has (and adds &#34;plain is as mild as we get!&#34;) and I&#39;m terrible at spicy food. This was a giant mistake because mine was super bland and boring. I got up to get some sauce from their condiment counter and tried the wild herb and lemon garlic. The wild herb was so incredibly spicy, it hurt my mouth. The lemon was DELICIOUS and I drowned my food in it. I&#39;ll know to get it ON my food for next time for sure. Husband got medium and thought it, too, was too spicy. We&#39;re like the freakin goldilocks of sauce here. The fries were delicious and the peri mayo was amaaaaazing! Husband loved his peas but I&#39;d rather die than eat peas, so I can&#39;t report on those.

By the time I got up to get my froyo, the machine was most def not working and though I was kinda bummed, I just returned the bowl to the counter and went to sit down. The gal who took our order noticed and offered to have the machine refilled but I didn&#39;t want them to go through the hassle of doing that. The manager overheard our convo and offered me a Naughty Nata in its place. It&#39;s a rich Portuguese custard tart that they heat up and bring to you and OOOH MAN are they good. The portion is incredibly small and that&#39;s tragic because I wanted like fifty more. I would come back just to have the Natas again. Plus, I really appreciated that the manager went out of her way to fix the situation of not getting what I&#39;d already paid for.

We left with our curiosity, if not our appetite, sated. I&#39;d probably come back to Nando&#39;s if I was with a crowd that really wanted to try it, but the chicken isn&#39;t so amazing that I need to return soon."

It&#39;s definitely different compared to other restaurants nearby. I&#39;ve heard good things about Nandos in general, so I figured I&#39;d give this place a try. Goodness, it is delicious! 

Upon arriving you are seated and given a menu. You order at the register and then they bring your food. They have the cutest- comfiest lounge chairs by the way! They have upstairs seating as well as downstairs. The upstairs portion has many more lounge- like chairs. Definitely different than what I&#39;ve seen before at restaurants. 

The menu has a variety of different things. Paninis, chicken, etc. I went with the chicken and two sides. The Portuguese rice and mashed potatoes are AMAZING sides to get with the chicken. The chicken itself has a kick. Beware- if you can&#39;t handle really spicy foods, do not get the chicken in hot! Great food, great environment. Check this place out."

Service was very friendly-but very inept. 
We went as a group of three. Two of us got our food in about 10-15 mins. The third, after half an hour of waiting, had to go up and ask about his order, waited a further 10, and finally got his plate. They said they would bring the fries in another plate, but that never came.
I got the flame grilled chicken breast and it was very tough (unlike the tender meat you get at the Chicago locations)...Peri chips were delicious, but the garlic bread was chewy, tough as old boots, and reeked of old butter.
For dessert I ordered a naughty nata and an espresso- which should take almost no time- but I only got the nata (unwarmed and unsugared) and the espresso never came after 15-20 mins so we were about to leave when it finally came to our table.

Will give this another chance though. It&#39;s still new."

First red flag is the sound (music) blasting so loud staff can&#39;t hear if I&#39;m ordering fries or rice. Then another red flag is the tables are numbered witch would confuse a straight line in to a curve. But nevermind that, the serve came to ask twice if we waiting for carryout, seriously twice on Sunday evening with half empty restaurant? Then our drinks arrive few minutes after we got our food not to mention that they were out of the beer that I ordered. Over all performance of the restaurant is one notch better then McDonalds.
Now as far as food goes, I ordered 1/2 chicken (extra spicy) with fries and my girlfriend ordered chicken wings (hot) with Portuguese rice and garlic bread. 
Ok let me remind you on the menu it says half of chicken not a leg and a half of chicken breast with a wing. And the wings looked like they were bought at Walmart. 
The whole flavor of it was mediocre at best and actually felt like I&#39;m eating overpriced Mexican food that was made by Russian prison chef.

The first time was during the first week of its operating, so I will give it some slack for the slow service and lack of knowledge displayed by the staff about the food.  However, I must say the food was great, so I brought my husband for the second visit a couple weeks later.  
My girlfriend and I tried a salad (hers with mango lime chicken, mine with medium spicy) a side of rice, a side of peas, and a side of fries.  If I was rating on the salads alone, the review would have to be five stars.  The unique mix of vegetables, cheese, and chicken introduced me to Portuguese/ South African favors I didn&#39;t know existed before. But the fries were cold and came without the dipping mayo, the peas were mushy but flavorful, and the rice was no better than Rice a Roni. 
The second time I brought my husband and we split a platter of wings, half mango lime, half spicy.  We were going to try some additional sauces from the jars by the soda, but they were so sticky and disgusting from previous use we decided against it.  We did love splitting a picture of mango Sangria, as well as the comfy, cushy chairs in the small booths downstairs.
I must say that even on my second visit the staff still seemed poorly trained.  It took forever for the manager to correct an error on the ticket in front of us (something funky with the credit card machine) and the girl who actually brought our food couldn&#39;t answer simple questions about the ingredients.  
Overall, three stars!"

The decor has a very cool but inviting vibe, so we gave it a try. The restaurant is very casual and the staff friendly. We got the half chicken and the chicken kabob. For anyone who doesn&#39;t like to work for their meal, go with the kabob. Both were tasty, it&#39;s just that you had to work to get all the meat off of the half chicken. They have a variety of sauces ranging from spicy to sweet. The patio out back is great for a nice summer day or night. Great addition to downtown Naperville!"

This is the second time we&#39;ve been and it was excellent! Today I learned they had outdoor seating, which thrilled me!!! That&#39;s my #1 factor when choosing a place to eat during the warmer months. However, I think it takes way too long to order...... 3 people ahead of us and we waited almost 15 minutes!! The staff was friendly and came by to check on us a couple times during our meal. Two great experiences so far.... will definitely be back :)"

I ordered a half chicken and I made it as spicy as I could. I really enjoyed the slow build up burn with extra added hot sauce. Yeah, it&#39;s expensive. I enjoyed it, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll make dining here a common occurrence. The gentleman who greeted me seemed pretty unhappy and the general service vibe, as others have said, is pretty unfriendly. The ordering process is a bit weird -- there was a place for &#34;tip&#34; on my receipt but honestly, if I&#39;m getting my own drinks and ordering at the counter, I&#39;m not tipping the service staff to bring the food to the table, never to see them again. This is probably why they all look pissed off. I think a few tweaks with pricing and the ordering process, and this place could really, really shine."

To my credit, the Naperville location, for which it was intended, did not come up when I did the search while sitting in the restaurant - the Oak Park soon to be opened location showed up. Even this one says its in Chicago, but has the same address and phone number as the Naperville location. 

If you have visible tattoos and like to be ignored, this is the restaurant for you! This was our first (and probably last) time here, so we didn&#39;t know how to navigate the place. A very nice girl named Anna told us how to order at the counter. We ordered, and I asked for a water with lemon, then sat down as my husband took care of the bill and drinks. When he brought our waters and glasses, I asked about a lemon, and he went back to the counter. This was a mere seconds, and he was asked if he was ready to order. He relayed that I had asked for a lemon, and the girl said, &#34;OK&#34; and went back to wrapping toothpicks with flags. So he asked the girl next to her, and was told it was self service. 

After that - we were lost. I asked a male server for napkins, and he brought them to us. When our food came, the server asked if there was anything else we needed, and we asked for silverware. She informed us by pointing that it was in the back hallway. She said she could get it for me, or I could get it myself. I opted to get my own. 

While we saw servers bustling about helping other customers, not one of them came to us to see how we were doing, or if we needed anything else. By contrast, the couple behind us was asked no fewer than five times by three different servers of everything was okay, or if they needed anything else. 

The place was not busy when we were eating. The only thing I could see that was different between us and the few other customer is that we have visible tattoos on our arms, me more than my husband. I had to remove my lightweight jacket because the veggie burger I had was quite messy, and I didn&#39;t want it all over my cuffs. I am a professional woman with a Master&#39;s Degree. I just happen to display my artwork and personality on a more visible way. 

My husband is annoyed he left a tip on the meal when he ordered - the service was pretty much non-existent until it was time to clear our table and move us along. 

We will not be back. There are plenty of other restaurant choice who employ staff who are more welcoming of all types of people."

I made the mistake of getting the 1/4 white meat dinner and it was rather dry. Next time, I&#39;ll go for the dark meat. The sides are great; I had the roasted vegetables and the butternut squash with roasted corn. In fact, I&#39;d go back for the sides alone (this would be a great option for a vegetarian).

Big portions, and I could have done just one side. Having lived in the northeast where there were a lot of Portuguese restaurants, this isn&#39;t really Portuguese food; it&#39;s Afro-Brazilian  colonial food. Not a bad thing at all, but I do wish there was an authentic Portuguese restaurant in the area. 

As others have said, if you don&#39;t like very spicy food, don&#39;t go above the medium. The interior is cute, in a funky sort of way. It would definitely be a fun place for a family meal. The front opens up in the nice weather making the downstairs dining area open to the street. The service is still a bit dodgy, but they&#39;re new so I think we should cut them some slack on that.

I&#39;ll be going back, but I think I&#39;ll get a side, a sandwich and a dessert next time."

Came on a Sunday evening for dinner and there were plenty of seats, although it was very busy.  The restaurant is very well decorated, filled with bright colors and fun decor.  We requested to sit outside, because the weather was absolutely gorgeous.  The patio area was enclosed, to obscure the view of dumpsters nearby and an unsightly parking lot.  The service was fine, although it took a while to get our food.

I ordered the half chicken meal, dressed with hot sauce, with a side of peas and garlic mashed potatoes.  The potatoes were very flavorful and soft, but rich.  You could really taste the garlic, and thats A-OK with me because I looooove garlic.  The peas were interesting, they had parsley and mint.  I don&#39;t love peas, but this was a decent, flavorful take on peas.  The chicken was just...ok.  It was moist, but really nothing better than rotisserie chicken that I could get from Jewel.  My husband ordered the steak sandwich, which was delicious.  The steak was tender and juicy, and cooked to medium rare, as my husband requested.  The food was on the pricier end, our meals came out to be around $30, and thats without drinks.  However, it&#39;s on par with what you&#39;d spend in downtown Naperville.

Overall, Id say its worth a try, but I was definitely not blown away by the food."

The rice side I was hoping to compare to Sangu Che, but this is nothing but essentially spiced up Goya yellow rice.  Meh.

The service here was awful and non existent.  From the moment I walked in with my family, I felt I was actually a hindrance.  No staff member smiled at us or said hello.  I wasn&#39;t even thanked after ordering. After delivering our food, no one came by to check in on us.  You have to get your own drinks which I get.  But everything from napkins, to our own dinner plates to the carry out bags, I had to get on my own.  Maybe I shouldn&#39;t have expected so much but the service alone really added a bad vibe to the meal.  I see no reason to ever come back and maybe they will take better care of you.

Went there first time with a group.  Ordered a whole bunch of items from veggie burgers to half chicken (recommended for first timers) to wing platters and skewers to the Natas and Choclate spoon cake.  Other than the wings, the chicken was cooked well.  The heat while cooking didn&#39;t translate that well to the meat though the collection of sauces that you can grab from helps.

Wings though - there was a lot of inconsistencies.  Some were burnt, others were dry and about half were perfectly cooked.  In addition, they do have red and white sangrias but like a typical &#39;fast-food&#39; place, no sampling. Natas were good but felt like they were microwaved before serving based on how inconsistently the custard was heated.  Spoon cake wasn&#39;t fresh at all but the frosting was good.  

Definitely a place to try out if you don&#39;t know what peri-peri is.  But going back for me may not happen."

When it opened I called to place an order....no answer. The next week I called to try again (I don&#39;t exactly get a lunch break so I have to eat my lunch in about 5 min most days)....no answer again. I finally went to the restaurant and inquired about their phone situation. The guy manning the register actually didn&#39;t even know they had a phone. I told him the website lists a phone number, to which he replied &#34;maybe the manager has it?&#34;  Umm ok. They finally find the phone-problem solved. So a couple days later I call in an order. Here is where it took all my strength to not flip out.

There&#39;s a to go bag on the counter-surely it&#39;s mine right? Wrong. Register girl checks the bag and it&#39;s not mine. It&#39;s for someone else.

2:10 a guy goes to put some fries in the bag and says &#34;this is for her, you guys have the wrong name on the bag&#34;

I was disappointed in the service though.  This is a new restaurant and I was confused on what I was supposed to do when I came in the door.  Typically, Nando&#39;s is an order at the counter and they bring you your food type place.  But I know they also sometimes wait the tables like a normal restaurant.  I was so confused on whether to sit down or order at the counter. Personally, I think some operating procedures need to change to make the restaurant more comfortable. Increasing ease of ordering, drink refills, paying, and a less complicated menu would improve this place like crazy! The flavor and cultural experience is there and exciting, the operating procedure is what is missing and it needs to be refined."

Although at one point the manager walked by to pick up plates and asked if everything was ok, I nodded and said yes thank u, because i had absolutely no idea where to begin. 
I sat down with my son, after the hostess sat us and never mentioned we needed to order at the front. 10 minutes later, we ordered and got our drinks and sat back down. Food came quickly, and the server placed our dinner and asked if we needed anything else. I said yes silver wear and extra napkins. She returned with a fork and knife for me, nothing for my toddler (which the fork was huge so it wouldn&#39;t of worked for him anyway!) and 2 napkins. I ordered apple slices for my son, which was a whole apple, un peeled, and he almost choked on the peel so I peeled them myself. At one point a waitress dropped something as she was walking past us. She put a stack full of plates down on our table, next to a baby, and grabbed what she dropped. Thankfully my son was occupied coloring with crayons I had to ask twice for. :) again, food was amazing! But the service was nothing I want to experience again. According to the menu I ordered my sons kids meal from, I think he was supposed to get frozen yogurt, bottomless it said. Nevertheless no one mentioned it, and I wasn&#39;t going to attempt to figure out how that worked. Next time I will order for pick up!!!!"

Several members of the staff were congregating towards the back of the restaurant . There was a sign that said wait to be seated so I did. Finally a host saw me and came over, he seemed pretty unfriendly as did the rest of the staff I encountered. I thought it was strange that you have to be seated first, then get up and order your food at the counter, and then sit back down and wait for them to bring it to you, the whole process is very counter intuitive. I ordered a wrap, it came with a side and I chose French fries. It was about $10 I was really disappointed with the lack of chicken in the wrap. For the price I was expecting something much larger and more filling. The taste was okay nothing to rave about. Overall, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll return.

Well, it turned out that waiting a half hour for sangria, and then learning they were out of the red variety, was the least of our problems. Unfortunately, we waited over an hour for a simple order of chicken and salad, before anyone realized anything was wrong.  It took my boyfriend going to speak with the manager to figure out that our order was lost.  Oddly, no one came to check in on us during that hour wait, despite the fact that the orders at the two tables on either side of us were messed up as well, or that groups who sat down long after us were given their food right away.  After we brought this to the manager&#39;s attention, he gave us a hard time because we hadn&#39;t asked for a copy of our receipt--like we were lying about having ordered food.  Believe me, I was not waiting there for an hour for my health.  If we didn&#39;t have to prepay, we would have left after waiting so long.  After addressing the situation, it still took another twenty minutes to get food. The manager gave us a free order of wings and extra chicken.  However, at that point, it was 10:00 at night.  It also didn&#39;t help that we could hear him offering the other tables free meals to come back and that was not done for us.  

This probably came down to a technical glitch.  Hopefully others have better luck.  However, this could have, and should have, been handled in a much better way."

For me, the diner atmosphere is the draw. Management is friendly, but &#34;You&#34; have to capture their attention to place an order!

THE LATE NIGHT CROWD is the money maker here. At that point, most people give a shit if a taco is greasy or dry as long as its sops up some alcohol.

QUICK service.

Even the language barrier is enjoyable- one time, we ordered a side of rice and got fries instead, haha- but they actually went well with the tacos.

It was cool that you got to see the guy cook your food in front of you if you get a counter seat.  They also had a spit broiler for the al pastor meat.  The sign outside read &#34;Best burritos in town,&#34; so I got an al pastor burrito $6.40, a steak, chicken, and pork taco $2.10 each, and a large Jamaica.  Service was good, despite the crowds.  

The tacos were pure grease bombs!  Good, but so-so greasy.  And the included hot sauce had a good amount of pepper seeds which will make you lock your lips on a faucet.  Burrito was better, was big and had lots of meaty pork pieces from the spit.

I&#39;m a big supporter of local business, especially if it&#39;s downtown, but this is a sad effort at being a restaurant. One night I was craving tacos so me and my brother went out for one, but instead of going to our usual spot I wanted to try this hole in the wall we seen a while back. I ordered a burrito de asada and a taco de tripas, but the cook said they were out of tripas, my brother ordered a torta de asada. It was a bit on the pricey side, but I thought it was gonna be worth it. So we get home, bag is feeling heavy and we&#39;re excited to dig in. We take our food out the bag and the bag has big grease spots and the food wrapper was full of grease, no biggie, doesn&#39;t kill our appetite too bad. We open the wrapper, I pick up my burrito and half the burrito tortilla is orange from all the grease and in the wrapper is a huge puddle of grease, at this point I&#39;m scared and hoping I don&#39;t get sick or get heart burn. I start eating, my brothers eating, I&#39;m not enjoying it but still trying to think what I think about it. I get about half way when I lose my appetite and think, this doesn&#39;t taste normal, something tastes over seasoned and I can&#39;t tell whether it&#39;s the beans or the meat. I pick up a piece of meat, and what do you know? It&#39;s that fake taco bell meat!! It crumbles in my fingers! My brother noticed it too and was just as disappointed. Look a little closer for the cheese because I didn&#39;t see it, instead of using traditional Mexican cheese they use yellow american cheese!!! I was disgusted!

I traveled down to Aurora to see what the Pastor was all about.  I ended up ordering a Pastor dinner plate. A BIG portion of Pastor, Rice, Beans, Lettuce, Tomatoes with corn tortillas.  I consider myself a big eater and I had a hard time finishing everything.  

I have to say it was the best Pastor I&#39;ve had to date.  It was my first time having pastor that was cooked on a spit like gyros are cooked.  Completely different favor and I like it. Another first was a thousand island type of sauce that was on the lettuce and tomatoes, wasn&#39;t sure at first but I ended up liking that as well. 

I&#39;m anxious to go back and order the Pastor nachos.  I&#39;ll go back. As others have mentioned, you might not want to be cruising around late at night, not that I encountered anyone unfavorable.  Just be aware of your surroundings and you&#39;ll be fine."

I had the carne asada taco and al pastor taco.  The asada was delicious but it paled in comparison to the al pastor.  The pork is sliced gyros style from a rotisserie onto a custom pan with a notch cut out just to conform to the grill.  He then dumps it on the flattop to crisp up while the tortilla heats up.

I hadn&#39;t gone in about 4 years until a recent visit with a small group of my friends recently.  The food was just as good as I remembered.

Our waiter had a great sense of humor, and helped make the meal very entertaining.  We were sitting near a photo of Clara&#39;s family (circa 1980&#39;s), and gave us some little tid bits about the restaurant and the history of the family.  

To drink, I had one of the chardonnay&#39;s from their wine menu and I was satisfied with my choice.  The prices for their glasses of wine are reasonable, and there are enough varieties to choose from.  

Over the years, I&#39;ve had various pasta dishes here, but during my most recent visit I had the Eggplant Lasagna Teramo.  This baked dish is made with spinach pasta, eggplant, cheese, and marinara sauce.   They make some of the best marinara sauce I&#39;ve ever had. They make it from scratch, and it very well made.  Ultimately, you probably can&#39;t go wrong with anything from their menu though.

We had 19 people in our group so we opted for a family style menu. My dad and uncle are the ones who set it up, but boy was it the way to go! Food was continuously flowing and I loved that we got to try so much. We were all so stuffed when all was said and done -- almost felt like grandma was cooking for us at home!

For starters, the restaurant itself is super nice. We sat at a large table in the front of the restaurant by a bunch of windows. The room behind us was beautifully lit with string lights hanging from the ceiling. I have been to Clara&#39;s once before, probably a decade ago, but they were located in a different building down the street. This new spot is much more impressive and welcoming then the small dark restaurant I remember from before. Thankfully, the food remains just as delicious!

Here&#39;s a run down of everything I ate (don&#39;t judge me): bread with oil (premixed with cheese, pepper, etc.), bruschetta, stuffed mushrooms, calamari, salad, chicken parmesan, tortellini in vodka sauce, lasagna with meat, Italian sausage, tiramisu, cannoli, cappuccino, and wine.

Phew! Feeling full is an understatement, but it was well worth the mild discomfort. Everything I ate was absolutely delicious! Our waitress and the other servers were awesome as well. When one course was finished, the other course was already automatically on its way. Waters stayed filled and wine was flowing. They even boxed up all the food that wasn&#39;t eaten so we could bring it home. And when I say boxed up, I literally mean we had a BOX full of to-go containers filled with leftover food. Portions were huge - even too much for my Italian family to handle! 

Family style was such a great option though. If you have a large group and don&#39;t want to  spend hours sitting down for dinner (and figuring out the bill), I would opt for this. Especially if you have a Cubs game to catch after ;)"

The waiter we had was great...very attentive, came by the table often to check on us and was very pleasant.

The food was amazing.  I had the chicken parm and my daughter had the chicken pesto.  The pasta tasted like it was freshly made (which I&#39;m sure it was) and the portions were HUGE.  The atmosphere was very nice although I wouldn&#39;t call it cozy.  It was pretty though with large windows overlooking a garden area.

We sat in a booth by a portrait of Clara and her family. The server explained how there are dishes on the menu named after family members.

I had the seafood marinara topped with calamari with pasta fagioli soup.  The soup was savory and had tender beans which made it enjoyable to have before pasta. I also had a glass of chianti which the server recommended. The wine was great with the marinara pasta. The entree size was very big and there was plenty for leftovers!

There are so many good menu options to choose from. I like that they offer spinach fettuccini and herb fettuccini. I don&#39;t see that at many restaurants.

If your meal is over $15 you get a salad or soup with it. I had the pasta fagioli soup and it was very flavorful.

For my meal I did the create your own with spinach fettuccini, alfredo, and grilled chicken. They make their sauce fresh to order which is apparent when you get your dish. The Alfredo is the only sauce without any garlic. I thought it was the perfect richness. The chicken was good quality and size. 

The server was very friendly And made good suggestions. 

The only thing I didn&#39;t like was 2 hours after my meal I had a stomach ache from all the oil in the food. I ate the leftovers the next day which was also followed by a stomach ache. I may just be overly sensitive to oil though."

I ordered spaghetti with meat sauce and an Italian sausage.  They gave me marinara and my sausage was dry and cold.  The noodles of my spaghetti were also starchy.  
I was debating whether to give this average meal two or three stars.  I decided on two because it was no better than a generic Italian place like Olive Garden, but cost more.  Sorry Clara&#39;s, but it was not good."

My wife has been talking about this restaurant for years. She was excited to try the new location but definitely nervous that all of her &#34;hyping&#34; would not match the new service. I have to say that I I was impressed from the moment I walked in. It&#39;s a beautiful restaurant. We were greeted and seated immediately in the sun room with open windows and brightly colored walls. We were immediately helped by a very friendly server, Craig I believe,  and then cared for by a team of people who made sure our glasses remained filled and that all needs were met. 

The food...wow...visually appealing, wonderfully flavored and the portions were very generous. The options for sauces and extras are exciting and insightful. 

I created a spaghetti bake which Ioved. I&#39;m typically not  a fan of tirmisu but Clara&#39;s had me reaching for more.

The food was good, solid Italian fare. I had the special crab-stuffed manicotti and the lobster bisque. Both quite good. They didn&#39;t knock my socks off, but they did not disappoint either. Not a huge plate of food, but not tiny. (Everyone at the table cleaned their plates easily, including the kids who ate off the regular menu.) My wife had the baked eggplant lasagna dish. That looked awesome, and she said it was very good.

The waitress was nice and around just enough. Overall, a good solid experience."

You can ask for Pat - our preferred - or any of the servers...they are all superb.

Our favorites are the Calamari for the appy (make sure you order that grilled), with the Steak Toto and Shrimp Ersilia for entrees. They are always accommodating, so make sure you ask for extra mushrooms with the steak (cooked rare, of course) and some spice added to the shrimp - you won&#39;t be disappointed.

Finish things off with the Lemon Delight if they have it!

They also have one of the best quality wine selections in the area with reasonable prices on everything.
 
All of the food is well above average. You&#39;ll get 5-star restaurant food and service, but at 3-star prices.

One of the very best in the Woodridge/Naperville area and well worth the drive even if you&#39;re not local.

One thing we used to love about Clara was the warm service that make you feel like family and great food.  NO MORE!  
We made reservation and were seated promptly at the front area by the bar and fireplace.  Our waitress wasn&#39;t friendly and didn&#39;t tell us the special and mostly ignored us the whole time.  She never came to check on us nor served our dishes (bus boys did).  The mussels were tiny and not fresh which we had to spit some out.  The sausage pizza were greasy and salty (worst than Dominos).  The salmon were tiny and not fresh.  Instead of one whole salmon filet, it came as 3 tiny pieces like we were served leftover.   We felt DISCRIMINATED as minority and rushed the whole time.  The waitress were attentive to the table of white folks on our both sides and told them today&#39;s special and checked on them frequently.  The hostess came by to clear our table as we were still eating, act to rush us out so they can turn the table as few people were waiting to be seated.

Bread basket had crusty white rolls and nice buttery focaccia style bred with an olive oil dip that had spices and parmesan in it. Nice welcoming touch!

Rudy Jr&#39;s Shrimp pasta dish was great, very light but also flavorful with a buttery sauce and perfectly cooked shrimp. Also tasting other dishes at our table,my next favorite was their lasagna which was a very solid traditional lasagna that I would order again. 

Desserts left something to be desired, cannoli and spumoni were underwhelming.

The venue I booked for my rehearsal dinner permanently closed and I needed to find a replacement quickly.

I called Clara&#39;s on a Saturday around 5. I was told the banquet person was on the floor and they could forward me to her voicemail. They said I&#39;d get a call back that night. I didn&#39;t pay much attention to the outgoing message about her availability because I was promised a return call on Saturday. I spent Saturday night watching my phone, expecting to have to duck out of my own birthday party to handle this.

I did remember that her outgoing voicemail said she had Sundays off, but it also said she checks email when she&#39;s not in. I didn&#39;t feel the need to send an email on Sunday because I assumed she had heard my message on Saturday and didn&#39;t call back because it was late.

Monday afternoon rolled around and I hadn&#39;t been contacted. I went to Clara&#39;s website to find the phone number to call again and realized that they are closed on Mondays. I sent an email around noon (remember her message says she checks email!).

I didn&#39;t hear back on Monday. Tuesday night, when I still hadn&#39;t heard back, I booked another potential venue (they responded the same day). Tuesday night, I posted an initial Yelp review about Clara&#39;s lack of contact.

I was finally called back late in the morning on Wednesday. I answered and said I had found other accommodations. I updated the Yelp review, mentioning that I was finally contacted on the fifth day.

Later Wednesday afternoon, I got a call from Clara&#39;s, followed immediately by another, unknown number. I was in a work meeting and couldn&#39;t answer. When I got out of the meeting, I called the unknown number back. It was the Clara&#39;s banquet manager who kind of apologized, but was also kind of passive aggressive. She was sorry they couldn&#39;t live up to MY expectations. Her message SAID she was out of the office (ignoring that I called on Saturday, when she wasn&#39;t). She HOPED there wouldn&#39;t be any more bad reviews from me on Yelp. 

She also tried to blame me saying that, when she tried to call back, my voicemail was full. This was parroted in Clara&#39;s response to my review. To their credit, Verizon had pushed an update to my voicemail and I didn&#39;t realize my mailbox was no longer set up. It wasn&#39;t FULL, like they insist. Also, they&#39;re acting like my voicemail stopped them from contacting me. I answered and spoke with them the first time they called me, on Wednesday morning. The only time I missed a call was later, when they called to complain about the Yelp review.

In conclusion, they didn&#39;t get back to me until 5 days after I called, when they promised a response on the same day. I received phone calls to complain about Yelp review. They posted a misleading response on Yelp to shift blame and make it seem like my fault."

We came here over the weekend for dinner and it was a good 45 minute wait for 2 people. However, we jumped on 2 seats at the end of the bar and had a great dinner.

The bartender, Morgan, was amazing! She was so busy but had time to make my boyfriend and I smile and was on top of her game. So the service was just great!

The food was fantastic! We ordered Bruschetta as an appetizer and it came out fast. It wasn&#39;t over-soggy and the bread was toasted but soft on the inside. We also ordered side salads, I got the ceaser and my boyfriend got the house and both were delicious! The ceaser was a $2.25 up-charge but there was definitely more to my salad than the house. Lastly, I got the fresh herb linguine with the vodka cream sauce with Italian sausage and my boyfriend got the rotini with primavera sauce and grilled chicken. Both dishes were amazing!! The pastas are homemade and you can tell! My sausage was thinly sliced and vodka cream sauce was perfect. The grilled chicken and veggies on the rotini were also so fresh.

I cannot wait to come back here to try more dishes! The prices were also much lower than I expected. A glass of wine, beer, appetizer, salads, entree pastas with a protein came to about $60. I definitely recommend coming here!"

It is a bit of a hike for me (maybe 30 minutes or so with traffic) but I was finally in the neighborhood and got a chance to check it out.

I definitely enjoyed the atmosphere and the friendly hostesses and wait staff. The restaurant is charming and cozy but with plenty of space to seat lots of guests. We were seated in a glassed in side area with the windows open which was very pleasant on such a nice day. Our orders were taken right away and the food was brought out promptly, warm and fresh. Nothing to complain about at all, and I enjoyed the experience there.

Italian restaurants are a tough market and it is hard to earn a 5 stars, especially in the western &#39;burbs. There are so many great ones out there. There were a few reasons why I ranked Clara&#39;s at a 3. I think my expectations were somewhat over-inflated by all of my friends&#39; ravings about the food, as I found it only so-so. My husband and I each ordered a different dish and then split them (the cheese ravioli, and the chicken parm) and we both weren&#39;t thrilled. They were ok, but nothing that I would order again. The side salads were actually quite good and I liked the house Italian dressing, so I may try a larger salad as my main course next time I go. The bread basket and oil wasn&#39;t all that great...I&#39;d skip it. We ordered the chocolate cake for dessert and it definitely wasn&#39;t worth it. Just a small bundt cake with a dish of vanilla ice cream, which I felt wasn&#39;t very tasty and didn&#39;t taste like a homemade dish. Ultimately, I think that for the price (quite pricey) the food isn&#39;t comparable to what you can get at other restaurants in the area. Even Maggiano&#39;s and Olive Garden are doing the buy one get one meal deal lately. So, getting just one meal that I wasn&#39;t too jazzed about for the same price as I&#39;d get two at the competition&#39;s restaurants just didn&#39;t feel like more than 3 stars to me. I&#39;ll probably give Clara&#39;s another shot in the future and see if I can find another meal that I like better there since I know so many folks love it, but the way I felt about my last meal I&#39;d be more likely to continue going to Maggiano&#39;s than to make the drive back to Clara&#39;s on a regular basis."

I was so excited to see how nice this new location looks comparing to their old place. This new Clara&#39;s seemed always packed with the customers when I drove by at dinner hours. 
The complimentary bread and dip were still awesome. The bruschetta was not what I expected. Mussel with marinara sauce was so so. 
The old Clara&#39;s has decent pasta dishes with excessive portion which is not the case anymore. The seafood pasta now came with 2/3 portion of before and less seafood which should not be an issue if they could flat the price a lit. The angel hair was a bit overcooked. The same thing happened with the Veal chop which was served medium well instead of medium as I asked. Kids loved the spaghetti with meat sauce and the pizza so I was happy there. 
Services were pretty good during a crowded dinner time. We made a reservation for party of 6 so no problems on waiting time. I wish I liked the dishes more as Clara&#39;s is so close to where I live."

Of course I usually order aglio olio or white wine sauce with fresh clams.  Those are good, but I need to be in the mood for those items.

Not sure how to reply to the comment made by Dawn and Rudy, so I&#39;ll try via an edit. To clarify my review, I find the red sauces a bit on the bland side, and we really don&#39;t do sauces laden with cream, so I can&#39;t honestly speak to those sauces.

This place is always packed and does not take reservations, which I find weird. At least they should put a certain amount of tables aside for guests who need reservations. Makes it inconvenient if you have more than 4 people. If you come during the dinner rush, you&#39;ll be waiting awhile. Yes, there&#39;s a bar, but I&#39;m hungry! lol

The service once you FINALLY get seat is fine. I&#39;ve never had any negative experiences with the servers. Again, this is a good choice for Italian, but not the best around town.

We have attempted to dine here before and were met with a 45 min wait for a table. Today we waited about 5 minutes for a table for 4 (2 adults and 2 kids)

The kids menu is nice. The kids get a choice of pasta with a choice of sauce or lasagna or I believe baked mostacoli. They also receive a scoop of ice cream at the end of the meal. One child chose spaghetti with marinara sauce and the other one choice spaghetti with butter and cheese. When brought to the table there was a definite difference in portion size. The Butter and cheese noodles was about 1/2 the amount of noodles as the marinara noodles. Big disappointment. 

We ordered calamari for an appetizer. I enjoyed it, my husband found it to be just ok.

My husband order Meat lasagna and I ordered chicken and portobello with pasta. Wow that was a lot of food. The lasagna was enough to feed 2 people and my dish was enough for a table of four to share!  It was all good and very filling. But that&#39;s it...just good. It wasn&#39;t the best Italian food ever. It was just ok.

Would I dine here again?  Yes.

The wife had the chicken parmagiana  and I the chicken portabella both over fettuccini with the cheesecake as a follow-up. There were somewhere around 12 different pastas that we could have substituted but the standard fettuccini was perfect as served.

We have made the decision to go as we have remembered it as a small but friendly and cozy Italian eatery with homemade cooking.  Perhaps the expansion of Clara&#39;s has taken away what was once valued and made them unique from other Italian eateries in the area.

First, it was a long wait for our table though we have made reservations days in advance.  Then, the the hostess failed to admit nor apologize after it was clear that they had prepared the wrong number of seats which delayed our table from being ready.  Though minor but the waiter also made multiple mistakes with our order. We all have our days and make mistakes but it is such a disappointment when the attitude from the waitstaff is ill-mannered.

There are plenty of Italian restaurants in the area.  I would imagine that it would be quite competitive for restaurant owners.  When house specialities are not spectacular and other entrees are mediocre; I would make more effort towards staff training to attract local customers."

I went last night with my friend because she lives right there and since it was Ash Wednesday, we were looking for meat-free options. 

Bread is ok, nothing special. The oil it comes with is good, but Carraba&#39;s is better. I started with a side garden salad and was very surprised when I got the bill and it was $4.50 for iceberg lettuce, 1 piece of tomato and some shredded carrots and zucchini. I have to remember not to order it again.

We also got the bruschetta roma and it was phenomenal. I loved it and took some home, too. I got the small 5 cheese pizza and it was decent, crust was a little TOO crispy for me but I know for next time. My friend got a pasta dish and she seemed to like it. 

Overall, I know I will be back. My bill for the salad, a pop and the pizza was $18 plus tip. My friend picked up the appetizer, which was nice."

I love their new location for the atmosphere and am so thrilled that the food has stayed of the same quality as their original. I really cannot say enough good things about the food here. When anybody says they don&#39;t love Italian food, I tell them its because they have yet to try Clara&#39;s - has never failed either. The food is just so fresh, all the sauces are amazing. My family and I prefer spicy food so whatever we choose to order we ask for the sauce to be the arrabbiata sauce. It&#39;s heavenly on their vegetable lasagna.   Its easily one of my top 5 restaurants I eat at. We come here for all big events and have so many memories at both locations. Service is always so friendly and accommodating. The wine list is amazing and the recommendations for pairing are always on point. The bread is fresh and tasty. I&#39;ve never had a bad meal at Clara&#39;s and will continue to frequent this gem in the suburbs. And on top of all this goodness, the prices are so reasonable for huge portions! My tips would be to replace any of the entrees with arrabbiata sauce for some spiciness and also to order the pasta e fagiole! Enjoy!"

Both were amazing. The waitress explained that they only have gnocchi on Wednesdays so it&#39;s as fresh as it get and boy, did it taste fresh. The dumplings were huge. There was plenty of cheese and sauce as well. I went in knowing I would love the gnocchi (because I&#39;ve had it before), but I was surprised that I almost liked the Rudy Jr Shrimp Special better. Wednesdays are also half price bottles of wine night, how awesome is that! We got a bottle of Moscato for $14, the exact same price as 2 glasses of the same wine would cost. Score. Thursdays are half price glasses so you can&#39;t go wrong there either. In my opinion, there&#39;s something for everyone at Clara&#39;s. Our waitress was great last night, too.

I road the school bus with one of the owner&#39;s kids. I loved that it was a true family business and a neighborhood staple. When I learned how to drive, I drove there. I have fond memories of that little strip mall location and through the years have brought friends and significant others there whenever they would say something horrific like &#34;Olive Garden&#34; is good Italian food. 

I moved out of state, got married and wasn&#39;t in the area as much. When I heard Clara&#39;s changed locations- I&#39;ll admit I felt protective of my little neighborhood Italian place and somewhat concerned. Would the quality suffer? Would the family welcome still exist? The warmth? 

I&#39;m happy to say the quality did not suffer, the building is bigger but still warm, and although the staff has branched out, everyone we encountered was friendly. 

Loved the red table wine. The grilled calamari was seasoned well/ big loops, and the vodka cream sauce was delicious. The pasta portions are huge, so we have leftovers."

I was so excited to see how beautiful the new location looked, the reviews looked great (for the most part), and it&#39;s always nice to see a local/family-owned business do well. But our visit was VERY disappointing. 

We were seated right away on a Sunday evening, we tried Friday night but that was a different story. 45 minutes plus. Our waitress was prompt and attentive throughout our meal. We decided to skip apps and enjoy the bread. It is delicious, but it is just bread. Nothing out of the ordinary. 

I decided to get the Cream of Chicken Pesto with the Red Pepper Gorgonzola salad, and my boyfriend got the Chicken Parm with a Caesar salad. I saw that my salad was $2.75 extra but it sounded so good that I splurged. Our salads came out right away and I spent a few minutes figuring out what I paid extra for. The garden salad that comes with your meal includes lettuce, carrots, zucchini, cucumbers and tomatoes. This salad was lettuce with a spoonful of tiny chopped red peppers and a few croutons. If you do the math, that&#39;s actually less ingredients........but you pay more. The dressing was good and the salad was well-dressed but the lettuce was 90% hearts that were terribly bitter. 

When my food came, I was happy with the amount of pasta and what seemed to be one full chicken breast. There wasn&#39;t anything special about the dish, I would probably rate it a 6 out of 10. My boyfriend was pretty disappointed in the Chicken Parm. I remember hearing that it wasn&#39;t breaded, but completely forgotten about that when he was ordering. Our meals seem to be made with the same piece of bland chicken, just dressed in a different sauce. The plate was slightly watery, and the sauce was pretty basic. 

We left our card on the table to pay, but when we got the slip he was not happy to see the extra charge for his Caesar salad. I knew mine was extra but the waitress flubbed and charged $6.50. We had to wait for the waitress to come back, explain the mistake and fix it. 

I&#39;m not so sure why they feel the need to charge extra for these basic salads, but it definitely isn&#39;t worth it. Our table was also incredibly wobbly and they sit on a pedestal so we weren&#39;t able to keep our foot on it to stabilize it. Just a minor problem that caused some irritation all night"

We had reservations for 5pm on Saturday and arrived about 15 minutes early.  We were seated right away and the focaccia and rolls with the olive oil dip was brought out right away. The focaccia with the olive oil dip is almost enough of an appetizer on its own, but there  After ordering our drinks, we ordered the appetizer of Buratta and Prosciutto.  The buratta was very fresh and tasty.  The only minor issue was they served it with a fork, but you really needed a knife to cut into the buratta; the fork just had it moving around.  

For the entree, I ordered my favorite dish, the Rudy Jr. Shrimp Special. There are just a few dishes I have enjoyed in life that I have actually dreamed about.  This is one of them.  It is a very simple spinach &amp; egg noodle dish but the garlic &amp; wine sauce is what makes it.  I was curious this time about just how many shrimp were in the dish and there were 14, about 1/3 of a pound.  Many more than I have gotten at other, higher priced places when ordering shrimp scampi or other similar dishes.  I always end up bringing at least half the dish home from Clara&#39;s because there is so much food.  

My boyfriend ordered the Cream of Chicken Pesto. We were both surprised at how much chicken was on the dish.  There was A LOT.  Again, there was so much on the plate that it makes for very nice leftovers.  

I&#39;m already anxiously waiting for my next opportunity to come back."

I really want to give this place a chance, but I really really hope the owners take my advice and look at their menu closer and taste their food.

  The restaurant is beautiful, new construction, the staff is awesome, everyone super helpful and friendly.  The ambience is great, hence the 2nd star.  The problem, the main problem is the food is not good at all.  Flavorless food.  Poor textures.  ridiculous large portions.  If you look at the photos of the food it&#39;s just not appetizing at all.  The bread was warm and good, that was pretty much it.

The food tastes old and lacking flavor.  Smaller more appetizing plate sizes would be better.  Please help make this restaurant better!

Look at your caprese, it&#39;s brown.  the tomato slices are too chunky, and it&#39;s cold.  should it be room temp?  a little olive oil on top.  good to go.  we like fresh Italian fare that&#39;s eye appealing.  not old tired food."

I&#39;m still can&#39;t believe this place used to be a Krispy Kreme! 

In terms of food, they are still serving delicious American-Italian food. I&#39;ve tried their chicken parmesan, lasagna, and now their stuffed noodles. All of them are dripping in cheese and soaked in a delicious pasta sauce. I&#39;d say their prices for their pasta dishes are about average. I would have loved to try their steak, but it was a little pricey for me. In addition to steak and pasta, they also have 10 inch pizzas at reasonable prices. My father and husband split a pizza and seemed to enjoy it. 

I found the service very attentive. We went on a busy Saturday evening and didn&#39;t have to wait long for our food, which was nice. In sum, great ambiance, good food, and reasonable prices.

I&#39;ve been going to Clara&#39;s as long as I can remember - both the old location and the new one. The new location features more seating, an updated (but classic) décor and ample parking. The one thing that has never changed is the quality of the food. The menu is expansive without being overwhelming, has options for everyone, and everything I&#39;ve ever had has simply been fantastic.

I was there this past Friday and a dinner for two (with a bottle of wine) rang up to $55. The wine was $30 of it. The food is beyond reasonably priced. Drinks run a little more expensive but comparable to the area, and they have a nice wine list that compliments their menu. Service is attentive and pleasant. I really have quite liked everyone that works here that I&#39;ve interacted with. It goes beyond the generic &#34;nice to have you&#34; - they&#39;ll make actual conversation with you. It&#39;s very nice and contributes to a very pleasant atmosphere.

Note: Clara&#39;s does not, as far as I know, take reservations. It can get very busy especially on Friday/Saturday prime time. I&#39;ve had to wait a time or two, but they&#39;re always honest in their estimates and then you have to decide if it&#39;s worth the wait."

We arrived around 6:45 on a Sunday evening. The place was decently crowded, but we were seated right away at a table near the window. Our server was Craig, he was friendly and attentive without being overbearing. 

We started off with the Prosciutto Burrata appetizer, which was absolutely fantastic and a good size serving (would have been plenty for a group of 4.) The crostini had a nice crunch to the crust but was still chewy on the inside. The prosciutto was very good and not too salty as it can often be.  My wife ordered the lasagna, and I got linguini with vodka sauce.  I added shrimp and gorgonzola cheese.  (They add the cheese on top and bake it for a few mins before serving - nice touch!)  My wife didn&#39;t realize they offered that option and wished she had gone with the baked mozzarella on her lasagna!

My wife really enjoyed the lasagna and it was a decent sized serving.  My pasta was cooked perfectly and the vodka sauce was delicious.  The shrimp was slightly overcooked but not too bad.  I regretted getting the gorgonzola, as the strong, sharp, salty flavor overpowered the flavor of the sauce and shrimp.  Should have probably gone with mozzarella or something else with a milder flavor that would have paired more nicely and let the vodka sauce shine.  But, that&#39;s my fault, not the restaurant&#39;s!  

I wasn&#39;t blown away by the portion size.  For all of the reviews talking about massive portions and taking home tons of leftovers, it was a bit of a letdown honestly.  Not that I walked away hungry by any stretch, but I was expecting a heaping plate of pasta that would be enough for 2 meals and it really wasn&#39;t.  

Overall, we really enjoyed Clara&#39;s and will absolutely be back!  Nice to have some high quality Italian food so close to home!"

Wish I could write a gushing review about the great food and fabulous service, but alas...that is not to be.   My husband, 22-year-old daughter and I went tonight (Tuesday) at 4:30 pm.  We were seated almost immediately and enjoyed the fresh bread and dipping oil.  Things started sliding in the wrong direction when our 22-year-old daughter realized she didn&#39;t bring her ID with her.  Since she was with us - and since I happened to have a wallet-size birth certificate of hers with me - we asked our server, Morgan, if that would suffice.  No dice.  Well, bummer...and really?  Would two older people come in with a young woman and offer up her birth certificate if it wasn&#39;t legit for the sake of one Moscow Mule?

Okay, moving on.  Husband ordered chicken parmesan, daughter ordered a pasta dish with aioli sauce, I ordered cream of chicken pesto.  Chicken in both dishes was over cooked (translate really dry).  They must cook all the chicken ahead of time, then cut and sauce it up when orders are placed.   Daughter&#39;s dish looked quite soggy and the sauce wasn&#39;t up to par either.  She barely touched it and this is a girl who loves her pasta.

Now it&#39;s time to settle the bill.  We had a $25 gift certificate which my husband received when he purchased $100 worth of gift cards for holiday gifts last week, but we failed to read the fine print.  It isn&#39;t valid until January 1.  Why the person who sold him the gift cards never mentioned this is anyone&#39;s guess.  Waitress must have been afraid to tell us this because she sent someone (the shift manager, presumably) to deliver the news.  My husband asked if they were going to stand on that date - it&#39;s 72 hours away, for Pete&#39;s sake - and this man said, &#34;Yes, I have to.  The owners are very strict about that.&#34;  Baloney.

So Clara&#39;s got two strikes tonight and I doubt we will ever be back as paying customers.  Our mail carrier is getting - you guessed it - a $25 gift certificate to Clara&#39;s to ring in the New Year.   I hope he/she has a better experience than we did.  BTW, if you read Rudy M.&#39;s response to every negative review you know they&#39;re all the same:  come back, spend more money, we promise we&#39;ll do better."

For some reason, they are closed on Monday and it does kinda stink considering I am normally not working on Mondays but whatever. 

We were able to finally pay a visit last week. The restaurant seems to be kinda big with a lot of elbow room. The front desk was very nice and there was no waiting at 6pm. We walked into a room and were seated. It was a little loud but that might have been due to the big party behind us and in front of us but whatever...no biggie. 

We ordered the Fried Calamari and it was good. I didn&#39;t like how they kept the sauce chunky since it was a little hard to dip. The bread was amazing with their flavored oil. 

I ordered a pasta dish with chicken and mushrooms with a lot of different types of cheeses. Normally, my biggest complaint was places never add enough cheese or I couldn&#39;t taste the mozzarella or blue cheese or whatever. However, I am glad to say this was not the cause here. They added a lot of cheese and as a cheese lover, I really enjoyed this dish.

The ambiance is very nice in their new location and the service was attentive, but the food is beyond mediocre. Our party of seven  each ordered different entrees and not one of us could honestly say anything was a wow. The lemon chicken was swimming in a clear &#34;sauce&#34; with no hint of lemon.  It was the worst my husband said he had ever eaten. Calamari was tasteless , pizzas were pretty good! Not in any big hurry to rush back!"

There are things that I really appreciate in a restaurant. When the customer service is genuine and friendly. I also appreciate when although there is high volume, the quality of the food is not overlooked! And lastly, I do try my best to support local businesses. Don&#39;t get me wrong I eat at chain restaurants, but something about building something from the ground up deserves acknowledgment. Anyways, the food was remarkable and the people were great. I usually get their limone chicken along with their delicious Caesar salad! Look out for their lobster bisque! It&#39;s amazing! :)"

Tonight, my wife and I decided to get take out for the first time, Chicken Parmigiana, Rigatoni with red sauce, and garlic bread.  All of the above were terrible.  Chicken was overcooked, Rigatoni lacked sauce, and the garlic bread was stale.   Maybe it was an off night or take-out is viewed differently by management than dine-in, but we were very disappointed with our experience."

I am glad that did not happen with Clara&#39;s.

Moving from their tiny, hard to get to strip mall location, to a brand new, reconstructed and enlarged old Krispy Kreme builiding a half block away, Clara&#39;s is clearly moving on up.  The new building consists of at least three seperate dining rooms along with a large bar and a more casual central seating area.  The whole place is beautiful, filled with dark wood and exposed stone accents, and low lighting, which puts it in an intamate setting without being impossibly dark.

Read my previous review to learn about the service and the food beyond compare, because that, in all its excellence, has not changed a bit!"

It was very busy considering it is valentines weekend but we still only waited about 15 mins without a reservation. The food was exceptionally cooked and exactly what was promised on the menu. I had the spicy Rudy&#39;s Shrimp Special and my husband had the 5 cheese pizza. Everything was fresh, and thoroughly cooked. I definitely look forward to trying more of the menu. The reason for the 4 stars was the service. Our waitress made a comment to another table about being a bartender, so maybe that is why her service was sub par. Our guess is that she isn&#39;t a regular waitress and was maybe asked for extra support during the busy holiday weekend. Either way, we were greeted, told the special and then she left. We waited for 20 mins before she returned to take our order and we hadn&#39;t even ordered drinks. Don&#39;t get me started on hoping for a refill. And then a middle age woman(owner maybe) walked around to multiple tables, all of which consisted of noticeably older couples, and asked them how their meal was. It irked me b/c our table was the first in the room and we were noticeably skipped over. My husband and I are 26 &amp; 27, so maybe we look too young to have an opinion that mattered. I&#39;m sure this service issue was the result of a busy weekend. I won&#39;t hold against them, and I look forward to my next experience dinning there."

They remind me of a Turano kaiser roll from the deli counter. Needs improvement. I got pasta fresca and it was great. My niece had Alfredo and it was one of the best I&#39;ve tasted.

I ordered a simple pasta dish with red sauce and meatballs. The pasta had not been properly drained and it sat in a pool of water, which made the entire plate watery. I didn&#39;t say anything because I didn&#39;t want to upset the other couple with us. Maybe I should have.

Service issues: The servers brought our entrees when we were smack dab in the middle of eating our salads and soup. Annoying. 
Then the servers started taking away plates when two of us were still eating. That is a service no-no. You should NEVER make your guests feel even a tiny bit rushed.

Was this on a busy Friday or Saturday night? No, it was a Tuesday night in late January and it wasn&#39;t crowded at all. 

Please educate your servers about how to make your guests feel at home and not rushed. And please drain the pasta!"

After years and years of driving past the old location, Clara&#39;s made a huge step up by renovating the old Krispy creme building. The new location looks awesome inside! Really snazzy.  
      When my boyfriend and I arrived the place was kinda empty (around 5pm) I&#39;m glad we got there when we did because Clara&#39;s filled up fast, and I hate being in an overcrowd restaurant. Weird huh? Considering all the concerts, live shows, and noise I&#39;m  constantly around. I just hate being elbow to elbow when I&#39;m trying to eat. 
         The hostess sat us at a table that my boyfriend and I hated. This table was in the middle of the floor. We  had people hustling and bustling past us, and I hated it which prompted me to request a move which the hostess accommodated. There were two ladies working the front, and the one I interacted  with was rather pleasant. A heavier set chick standing next to her made a face  like I had made an outrageous request.  Whatevs. They made the move for me and I was happy about it. The first waitress we had was kinda blah as well. 
               The hostess moved my boyfriend and I to a much quieter  spot in the back of the restaurant. I&#39;m glad the waitress moved us because the next waitress ( Christina) was pretty F*cking awesome. She was very friendly and I fed off of that. She stayed on top of things. Loved her!!  I just love people with a positive vibe. 
           My dinner companion and I decided to forego appetizers which was a very smart move on our part. We usually can&#39;t finish dinner because we fill up on drinks and appetizers. The bread was pretty good. I ate all of the square buttery  focaccia out of the basket while my boyfriend ate the  plain round rolls. He hates butter which was right up my alley! The focaccia squares were good!
        I ordered the seafood pasta. I typically order this at almost EVERY Italian restaurant that I go to just to see whose I like better. This dish is typically the most expensive on the menu everywhere. It&#39;s only $20 bucks at Clara&#39;s, but rosebuds it&#39;s $34, and I&#39;ve paid over $40 at other Italian joints. The dish usually consists of squid, calamari, shrimp, clams, mussels, and shrimp. Some places even put a whitefish in there. I didn&#39;t see any in my dish at Clara&#39;s. #SayWhat 
           Looking at my seafood pasta I kind of felt disappointed. My squid were the size of a Cheerios?! If I hadn&#39;t of went looking I probably wouldn&#39;t have noticed I had any in my dish. I&#39;ve really grown to like the taste of tentacles! My clams and mussels were also on the small side. There was hardly anything inside  those  shells. The meat that  was in the shells had quite a bit of sediment in it.  Can I get some mussels &amp; clams to go with my sand plz!? It did add texture to my clams just not the texture I was aiming for!  I did bite into one  mussel that tasted completely rancid. It tasted like I ate a fart cloud. Thank goodness it was just that one that tasted like that cuz I wouldn&#39;t have been happy.  There was plenty of calamari so I guess that made up for my squid.
          I did enjoy the firmness of the pasta. The sauce also had a nice flavor! I will return and try something else! I totally recommend getting there before around 5pm because the place fills fast! I was amazed at how packed it got quickly!

I received an invite to dinner from a friend that swears by this place. I trust her judgement with food so I was game and I also saw pretty good reviews here on Yelp. 

We grabbed a drink @ the bar while we waited for our seat as it was a bit of a wait due to it being a Saturday nite @ 7PM. Once seated we were greeted by our awesome server Craig and he made sure he got us our 2nd glass of chianti. We started out with the grilled calamari which was fantastic. Due to there being so many great items on the menu I struggled to decide on what I wanted. My friend gave me her recommendation of Rudy Jr&#39;s Shrimp Special. The dish included shrimp sautéed in fresh garlic, butter, olive oil and parmigiana served over Spinach and Egg Angel Hair and came along with a delicious caesar salad. The meal was phenomenal and I couldn&#39;t stop eating even though I was attempting to save room for dessert...I definitely recommend. 

Dessert was amazing as we went with one of my favorites, Tiramisu. It comes as a nice sized portion so you will definitely want to share. I could not believe we finished it as we were stuff from our entrees. Definitely a gem in the midst of chains over in Woodridge...do yourself a favor and get to Clara&#39;s for some really good Italian fine dining."

She recommended I make a reservation beforehand because they get pretty busy. So I called but they only take reservations for parties of 6 or more. Off to a bad start. 

We arrived and we were sat fairly quickly which was was a plus. They bring you lots of bread and oil before dinner so be careful not to fill up....the portion sizes are pretty large. I ordered the chicken parm and it was not good at all. I was extremely disappointed. The chicken was not breaded. Seriously? All chicken parm should be breaded. The pasta was homemade but it was extremely pasty. I hardly touched it. The sauce was not like marinara sauce. It seemed liked someone opened a can of whole chunk tomatos and poured it over my chicken and pasta WITHOUT DRAINING IT FIRST!! All of my food was floating in a pool of water. It was terrible. 

My husband ordered the linguine with meat sauce. His sauce looked better, but probably because the ground beef and linguine soaked up the water and his linguine noodles were also crap. My mother ordered the eggplant parm which was pretty much the same as my dish. Again, her eggplant wasnt breaded. Thats a mistake. 

Aside from the food, the atmosphere was great. It had excellent lighting, it was very clean and spacious and we sat in a huge booth that allowed us to have a personal conversation with one another without being heard or having to hear others. The waitress, April, was on top of her game. She was polite, professional, and did not mess around when it came to providing us refills. Her timing was always excellent. We didnt feel rushed to hurry up and order and she wasnt too slow. The prices were decent for the portion sizes. It was 80 bucks for the four of us and that was with drinks and dessert.

The managers really need to step up. There were kids running around everywhere and one of them almost knocked down a waiter carrying a whole tray of food. At this point, the managers really should have stepped in and handled the situation. I dont come to a restaurant and only pay for food. I pay for the atmosphere. So when I go to a nicer, expensive italian place, I shouldnt have to look at kids running up and down the aisles playing tag with one another.

If I ever return to this place, it will be for the dessert alone. Dinner sucked, but the Limoncello Marscapone Cake and Tiramisu was to die for."

Clara&#39;s gets 5 stars from me (in spite of the fact there&#39;s an hour wait each time I go).  Also, no reservations unless it&#39;s a party of 5 or more.

This place just moved from a strip mall on 53 to the building formerly known as Krispy Kreme doughnuts.  They pretty much gutted KK and rebuilt the place in their own way.  Since it opened last year, they&#39;ve added on like 3 new rooms to the place, and the wait is still an hour.  Fortunately there&#39;s a well-stocked bar to keep your mind lubricated while you wait :)

The hostesses, bartenders, and servers here are the best.  Everyone is so friendly and they really work to make you feel welcome.  Hospitality is a dying art, and these guys manage to do it every time I come in.

Food itself is sublime- think homemade type dishes.  The lasagna (both the eggplant and meat) are the best things to order here.  I&#39;ve also had the combination plates where you can mix your own pasta and sauce choices.  The pizza&#39;s are huge and delicious.  Salads are good- the mesclun is the best one, by far.  Desserts are good (but I don&#39;t usually partake)- my kids love everything on the menu.

Overall, just a real neighborhood gem.  I think they should re-open in the their original location (in addition to the new building)  just to handle the sheer volume of customers."

Clara&#39;s used to be housed in a strip mall with block text advertising the name of the restaurant; you wouldn&#39;t know it was Italian (or a restaurant!) unless you looked it up. The new location is fantastic. While I believe it may be a bit smaller, the ambiance is much better. How they turned an old Krispy Kreme location to a beautiful Italian restaurant.

If Clara&#39;s continues to thrive, they&#39;re going to need more tables in the bar. We had reservations for 7:30, and waited for nearly 40 minutes AFTER our reservation before we were seated. I can&#39;t knock a star down though for that - we were approached by both the manager and the owner and received two free appetizers for our wait. We weren&#39;t bothered, just ordered a few drinks at the bar as we waited. We were surprised when we were brought around the corner to our seats - we didn&#39;t realize the restaurant was as big as it was. It was cozy and comfortable.

Our server, Melissa, was fantastic. Upbeat, and very nice. We started with the Goat Cheese Pizza as an appetizer as well as half fried, half grilled calamari. The pizza was fantastic. Huge slices and crispy crust. I could eat just this! The calamari was surprisingly good too. I&#39;ve had lots of calamari, but this was a bit better than most. The grilled had a great flavor to it, and the fried was lightly breaded, so you could still taste the calamari. 

For dinner, I had the Shrimp Ersillia. I despise sun dried tomatoes, so I asked for regular. Melissa suggested I order either extra spinach or mushrooms instead, as fresh tomatoes may water down the sauce. The fact that she knew to recommend this and knew the dish/menu that well was super impressive. I so appreciated this! I ordered extra mushrooms and it was fantastic.

Allow me to reiterate. I was with great company, but I could have literally moved to a corner and just ate in silence. This was so good, I didn&#39;t need conversation or company. It was creamy, garlic-y, salty and cheesey...so good. Very fresh. And LARGE! I had enough for a big lunch the following day...though I could have eaten this for weeks on-end. 

For dessert we ordered the tirimisu and the a chocolate cake that tasted like a lava cake. Both were delicious - the tirimisu was a little less chocolatey or coffee-tasting than I had expected but both were great.

I can&#39;t wait to come back and support this small business. The new location is the icing on the cake!"

Granted, we only have a couple fine dining restaurants, but what I really liked was the incorporation of art in the restaurant.  Each area features a different local artist.  In terms of food, I had the Steak &amp; Shrimp Kabobs on a bed of mixed vegetables.  The shrimp was great, the beef a little tough, but that happens.  The flavor was great.  I would order it again.  My wife had the Parmesan Crusted Chicken &amp; Dates.  She really liked the sweet flavor of the dates and the very light breading on the chicken.  We both agreed that we&#39;d skip the desert next time.  I ordered the Bourbon Fudge &amp; Banana Ice Cream.  The fudge was decent, but I didn&#39;t care for the banana ice cream or the mousse.  My wife ordered the Flourless Chocolate Torte which she ate but wasn&#39;t sold on it.  It just doesn&#39;t hit the spot desert wise.  Next time we&#39;ll save on desert and get ice cream next door at Brain Freeze.  Oh, and one other thing, the prices are pretty reasonable.  If you haven&#39;t been, you should try it.

The time around order something new. Got the pork belly. It was different since it was just braised but not seared on the fatty side but it was still amazing. The meat was very flavorful and tender. You cannot go wrong with pork. It was like eating a pillow of porky goodness. 

The drink menu is also very good. They have everything from wine, beer, liquor and cocktails. The wait staff is very knowledgeable of the menu. They picked out the best wine for my meal. 

Will definitely be back need to try the sweet wine flight next time."

After we sat ourselves, we waited 15 min for a server and menu. She didn&#39;t tell us anything about the menu or specials. Which I heard her telling other patrons as we waited 30 minutes for our check. As we perused the menu for several minutes, because the waitress gave us plenty of time, we finally got to place our order. I made the mistake of agreeing for our appetizers to come first. Didn&#39;t know there would be a 30 min break between our appetizer and main course.  The 1.5 hour dining experience at this place was painful. At the end the waitress brought or check and didn&#39;t even offer us desert. Which again I heard her offer to other tables. Was i treated this way because I&#39;m younger than her other patrons? I don&#39;t know, but my waitress was rude. I also got the free wine with check in, when i asked which wines were included, the waitress got an attitude, told me wines less than $11, and only 1 per check. I&#39;m like ok. I mean I only asked for one, my boyfriend doesn&#39;t even drink... could she have asked what kind of wine I wanted a red or a white and suggested something from that category that paired well with my meal? Yes she could, but she did not, because she was a horrible waitress. 

The food was good.  The boar sausage was amazing. That sauce! I wish it came with bread so I could&#39;ve sopped it up, or even a spoon. I also had the lamb burger. So juicy, that mayo paired perfectly, and I don&#39;t even like mayo. The pita chips so crispy on the outside, and yet so soft and almost potato like on the inside. Delicious! My boyfriend had the venison,he ordered it medium RARE, it came DRY and medium well. Truth is I blame the waitress for that too.

The ambience is choose your own adventure. I like the lighting in the room we were in, but the chairs weren&#39;t as comfortable. The also have bar seating.  And some plush couch seating area. 

Will I be back, MAYBE... definitely would walk out if i got that awful waitress again."

Will(our server) was AWESOME! He was very attentive and ready with information about the food and wines.

Everything we had from the 1st course to the last was absolutely wonderful! The Citrus Salmon and  the Ahi Tuna were awesome.

We ordered the sausage with sweet sauce with apple slices (I think it&#39;s decent..3-4 stars), the flank steak (well cooked, solid 4 stars...the side salad was also great) and pork chop.

I LOVE wine but have been on a &#34;lifestyle change&#34; of sorts which has required me to cut way back on my fermented grape intake - except for special occasions - so when I do partake, it&#39;s all the more special.  

Imagine my delight when I discovered the Yelp check in offer of a free glass of wine with purchase of an entree.  I availed myself to this offer.  I had contemplated just ordering small plates, but the allure of a free glass of wine was all the convincing I needed and I went for the entree.

The first thing I ordered was a chardonnay flight.  Yes, a flight specifically devoted to chardonnay (aka, my favorite wine).  It was delicious.  One of them exceptionally so, which is the one I ordered for my free glass.  I want to say it was the Castillo Montjardin.  

The decor and ambiance of the place was nice.  We were sitting at a private table just back from the front door.  There was a room off to the side that sounded pretty noisy, so I&#39;m glad we weren&#39;t in there.  

Now, for the food...  This was actually probably pretty comical for my tablemates.  I had a pleasant little buzz going on from my chardonnay flight and as I was biting into my salmon, I noticed that it tasted REALLY SALTY.  Like, really.  I kept declaring, after each bite, &#34;You guys, this is reaallllllllly salty.&#34;  Two minutes later:  &#34;Oh my gosh you guys, this is reaaaaaaally salty!&#34;  

Fast forward a few hours (this is where it gets good)...

I woke up at like 1 in the morning with a TERRIBLE pain in my stomach.  I couldn&#39;t tell if it was going down or coming up.  I laid there for a few minutes hoping it would go away, but it did not.  I decided quickly that I needed to bolt to the bathroom.  Not to get into too many details, but it was not pretty and I was hugging the porcelain throne for a good hour.  

It was actually a huge bummer, because despite the saltiness, the food was actually really good.  I try to eat super healthy and don&#39;t go out to eat very much anymore, so maybe it was just too much for my digestive system to handle.  

Next morning though, I was completely fine.  Woke up, went to my workout class and was good as new.  

I&#39;d totally go back to this place, but I would order something different.  Maybe more wine."

The food was phenomenal. I got the Banana Foster French Toast and literally wished I could order a second plate! It was so delicious. Another in our group was raving about the quesadillas...seemed simple enough but they were tasty as well.

All in all, we will definitely be coming back for dinner to see how the night menu shakes out!! 

*****Update*****
So we came here for dinner and definitely had a wonderful time, although I&#39;m slightly weighing in on the value of the money spent vs what we got from the restaurant. 

I got a flight of wine and my boyfriend got a flight of scotch. Both were very good, but the cheese and meat plank was $25!!! There were 3 pieces of each of the 6 types of food on the plank. If you don&#39;t choose 6 for $25, you could be paying $6-8 for a few slices of each piece you choose. A little unrealistic. The plank was delicious, but way overpriced for what you get!!

I got the Kobe beef sliders for my entree and the two that came with it were great! The lemon aioli was to die for. The plate was small and was roughly $7, so good value. My boyfriend got the flank steak, which was overly chewy and tough and came on a very small plate. He was less impressed, so I gave him some aioli to sweeten the deal.

We got the chocolate tort for dessert and it was very good and rich!!

Also note, it seems that everyone eats in the bar, no one eats in the actual restaurant. We ate in the bar since that&#39;s where all the action was. Overall, we had a good time with good food, but $100 deep for 2 people only? Ouch..."

This place did not.

Positives: Plenty of wine and adult beverage choices. Parking isn&#39;t an issue. The ambiance is nice and cozy. And the wait staff was very friendly.

But common, that&#39;s not why you go out to eat?!  It&#39;s to eat tasty food (or at least that&#39;s what my angle is ;) A friend of mine and I decided to check this place out. We usually go to the Snuggery (which has awesome food) but we wanted to try something new. We felt like the &#39;small plates&#39; caught our eyes more that the main courses so we ordered 4 small plates. The waitress told us that&#39;s a great idea and lots of the customers do decided to share the little plates.

The problem is, each of these tapas cost $6-8 a piece. We ordered four. And honestly, we could have ordered two more. We got the citrus shrimp- it was very good but there were only 3 ?!?! Fingers were almost broken over that last 3rd shrimp. We got the lamb meatballs. They were pretty meh with the out-of-a-can tasting cream of mushroom that acted as the sauce. And again, there were only THREE! The stuffed mushroom was fine... there was only one. The wagyu sliders was the most diplomatic plate as it was fairly distributed (two!). Although, the wagyu was NOT the star of this dish- the start was definitely the fries.

There&#39;s nothing wrong with these portions specifically, but they were difficult to split and we may have chosen different items if we knew there was only going to be one or even just 3.

The non-flour chocolate torte for dessert was better than the entrees... but I would not go out of my way to every have it again.

All 4 small plates, one dessert, and 4 glasses of wine and the bill was around $80.

I&#39;d go again for a happy-hour type thing, but I&#39;ll pass for dinner."

Their wine list is extensive and their food is tasty.  We had a wine flight, a blueberry beer and both the beef and the pork sliders, both served with sweet potato fries. The sliders were amazing! No BBQ sauce on the pulled pork (huge plus for me) and it was seasoned so well. The Kobe beef sliders were juicy and delicious. Both sliders are served on a pretzel roll.

I&#39;ve dined at other (often more expensive) restaurants and they&#39;ve overcooked and dried out the fish (e.g. Devon&#39;s).

They also cooked the steak my partner ordered perfectly.
Certainly their cook really knows what he or she is doing!

On the negative side:
- they didn&#39;t serve dinner roles (perhaps they forgot)
- music was too loud and ruined the ambience (although it may have been due to a party they were hosting that night.  All they played were tunes from the 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s)."

The restaurant is quite large but it felt like they weren&#39;t making the best use of their space, the tables were spread out in such a way that it was a little confusing.

We decided to sit at the bar, it took the bartender several minutes to even make eye contact and say hi, when she did she said she would bring us some waters which never came.

I had wine and my husband had beer and we were both happy with the selection.  There was a lot to choose from and the options were all quality choices.

We love to eat so we ordered a lot of food.  We started with a meat and cheese board that was OK.  I really liked the cheeses but some of the meats were a little dry which was disappointing because charcuterie is one of our favorite things.  We also ordered the lamb meatballs, grilled cheese panini, and Thai style flank steak.  The sweet potato fries that came with the grilled cheese were awesome, we definitely fought over them a little bit.  The other items were also just OK, we ate them but they didn&#39;t knock our socks off.

At 7:30 two guys started playing acoustic music which was really nice.  However, until the live music started they were playing 90s and early 2000s pop punk music that just didn&#39;t really fit the vibe they seemed to be going for.

We didn&#39;t have a bad time at Flight 112 but since it isn&#39;t super close to where we live we probably won&#39;t go back.  Maybe give it a try if you live close by."

Lucky for us, there was room available inside and our waiter was very kind in accommodating us. 

The hummus flight was amazing! And we couldn&#39;t get enough of the citrus shrimp. 

For my entree I had the Grilled Flank Steak which was spot on in taste and seasoning.  

We all agreed to come back and try the rest of the menu."

We chose to eat in the back dining room and I&#39;m not sure if that caused the difference or if it was just an off night.  The food was still good; it&#39;s obvious they care about ingredients and presentation, but the service was sloooow.  We had to wait a long time for everything - drink menu, drink ordering, drink delivery, food ordering, etc.  Combined with a very under cooked pork chop that had to be sent back to the kitchen, we were finally eating our entrees 75 minutes after our reservation time.  Our server was pleasant, but he was covering six or seven tables by himself, as well as carrying multiple loads of dirty dishes through the dining room.

I am not a slaw fan but it was delish and of course the crab cakes, too. We had pork sliders, again delish. Had the 6 choice cheese and meat plate... was to die for. Goat cheese truffle was outstanding. They also give you warm bread.  

For our entrees we had the leek Flatbread and flank steak. Both were so tasty.  The flank was so juicy and flavorful. .. Definitely will come back again and next time I will save room for dessert.  The banana split is calling my name.

There was really no one at the front of the house, but once we got inside to the bar/seating area, all was well.  It seemed a bit loud at first (TVs), but either we adapted (talking louder/getting more liquored up), or perhaps they turned them down a bit?  They had some interesting artwork on the walls that are available for purchase. I enjoyed the piece we sat near, but I didn&#39;t exactly have $275 clams for it. :) 

I was stoked they had Delirium ($10), but dismayed that they didn&#39;t carry Stella Artois (what can I say? Creature of habit mostly...).  &#34;We have Miller Light,&#34; our server offered.  Errrr.. Nooo.  He asked if I wanted something similar to Stella and brought it out without even telling me what it was or anything.  Oookie dokie.  I&#39;m not a beer or wine connoisseur by any means, but isn&#39;t it kind of standard to at least explain or give a sample?  He brought me a Trumer Pils ($5), which I only knew because the glass had &#34;Trumer Pils&#34; on the side, lol.  We were given waters, too, which I always appreciate.

My +1 enjoyed a few Lil&#39; Sumpin Sumpins (cool name), which our server described as &#34;not very hoppy.&#34;  IMO, his tasted &#34;hoppier&#34; than my Trumer.

Service was not overbearing and appropriately attentive.  As the night progressed, I did stop and ask our server what time the bar closed.  He said, &#34;We don&#39;t really have a set closing time - just sort of whenever people are here until.&#34;  Err?? (Kind of the oddest thing I&#39;ve heard, but we kind of shrugged and went on with our conversation.)  Around 12:00 he mentioned that there would be a last call and asked if we&#39;d want anything else.  The lights all came on at 12:30a and pretty much blinded us and the other 4+ patrons in the bar.  Alrighty then; I guess it&#39;s time to go.

In all it was OK, but in the future I&#39;d want to find a cozier type of bar with staff who was a little more knowledgeable/forthcoming."

My boyfriend had the drunken chicken, I thought it was going to taste weird with grapes, but they paired so well with the sauce and the potatoes.

Last time we visited, they were out of a couple of beers I tried to order. The beer I did order (which I&#39;ve had many times) tasted a little skunky...as if it was old or wasn&#39;t stored properly. I hadn&#39;t had problems on previous visits however.  

Service was friendly but a bit slow. The kitchen was unfortunately closed but the waiter was nice enough to bring out a cheese plate for us. The cheese was ok.

Their website states that they offer packages starting at $12/person, but I was able to negotiate something for our small group doing a clothes swap.  Betsy, the events coordinator, allowed us to use the space free of charge provided we do a 2-item minimum per person.  Everyone had a glass of wine (or two...or three...?) and had a good time.  

We were allowed use of a side room which was undecorated.  It didn&#39;t need to be, we only needed tables and space.  White walls, black tables, checkerboard tile - all very blah compared to the chic bar around the wall from us.  It was ideal for what we needed, but I wouldn&#39;t want to use this space for a birthday or elegant event.  I&#39;m not sure if you can reserve their other space, but what we had looked like it was overflow space or somewhere a band or DJ might set up.

There were a few things about Flight 112 that frustrated the hell out of me.  Things happen, I know that.  But when you&#39;re out of Three Floyds Gumballhead AND Shine Reisling, it&#39;s annoying to have to look at the drink menu a third time.  There were only two reislings and the other one, Badger Mountain, was terrible.  Not to mention the bartender with the Ringling Brothers mustache didn&#39;t hide his annoyance when I didn&#39;t want either of the TWO options of beer on draft.  Sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to be so high maintenance, but you keep running out of things.

Our event started at 6:30 p.m., and several of us were looking forward to trying the food menu as well as the wine.  They had what they called a &#34;modified menu,&#34; which included a bison burger and something called &#34;mushroom and asparagus.&#34;  I don&#39;t know what constitutes having a modified menu on a Thursday night - the bar, the tables, and the back room were all quite busy.  None of us ate.  A small group of us went to a pancake house after the event instead.

During our semi-private event, two men sitting in the bar area snickered and pointed at what they called, &#34;all the moms.&#34;  Well, look here Mr. Greasy Slicked Back Hair and Your Awful Olive Green Button-Up (who I believe was an employee) - I am NOT a mom nor were several of my friends here.  My one friend, who IS a mom, really was irritated since she made the effort to dress nice for the evening.  From what I hear, moms don&#39;t get that option too often.  Flight 112 needs to tell their slimeball line cooks that if they want to enjoy a glass of vino after their shift to ZIP IT.

To summarize, the wine list is OK.  The beer list is OK.  If I were in the area, I&#39;d try somewhere else like Tannin&#39;s, and if I were going to organize another event I&#39;d try somewhere else.  Period.

Best for grabbing a quick glass of wine or a beer before/after your train, since it&#39;s just across the tracks.  Also worth noting is that we were able to use their space free of charge.  I would&#39;ve waited to write a review until I got a chance to go back, but I was really underwhelmed with this place."

We walked in &amp; waited &amp; waited so I finally walked to the bar.  Three, THREE bartender/servers were cleaning glasses, looked at us, &amp; continued cleaning.  Finally someone (who we weren&#39;t even sure was a server?  Maybe manager?) saw us and acknowledged us.  I told him we had reservations, which surprised him?  I asked are you still serving?  And he said &#34;we should be&#34;?  At this point I was ready to leave, but he said they were &amp; we thought we&#39;d give them a chance.  We should have left. 

We sat at the bar.  This mystery person dropped off our menus &amp; said a bartender would be with us.  There were three bartenders but it still took a good 15mins before anyone asked our for drinks.   We both ordered craft beers.  Mine was so foamy that I only got a 1/2 pour at most, and my husband maybe got 3/4.  

It was clear that we were not wanted.  One server windexed nearly to my husband&#39;s arm cleaning the bar.  No one ever asked how our food was, did we need anything, or BASIC customer service.  Instead we watched as they polished glasses...three people, all behind the tiny bar polishing glasses &amp; ignoring us.  We heard them complaining about customers, complaining about tips &amp; question each other about some $8.00 cheese that was left out all night, to which we heard, no joke, &#34;you know you can&#39;t put that back in the fridge, right?&#34;  Ugh.

I will compliment to kitchen/chef:  our food was excellent.  Please find an establishment worthy of your skill, because with the horrid customer service I don&#39;t see how they can keep business."

The first time I came with my husband it was on a Saturday night. It was so busy that we had to sit at the bar. This time I called ahead for a table, but we were there so early in the evening it didn&#39;t matter. 

We were greeted right away, mostly because we were the only ones there. I ordered the Pear Blossom cocktail, and my friend had a vodka &amp; club soda. Her drink was a no brainer, but since I hadn&#39;t ordered the Pear Blossom before I didn&#39;t know what to expect. It was OK, but missing something because it was as clear as the vodka/soda and in the description there should be a sour mix. I drank/nursed it for a while. By the time my friend ordered her 3rd I ordered another Pear Blossom. This time it came out totally different. I mentioned it to the server and he said that this one was the right drink and that the first drink was made by a new bartender. I told him I thought it didn&#39;t taste right. I did finish the first one but I think that I should have gotten a free drink or that first one taken off my bill. That&#39;s why I gave 3 stars. It was Lady&#39;s night that night but not really sure what that meant. Nice place but they really need to do the right thing for the customer when mistakes are made.

Our waiter was Will and even though he was extremely busy he did not miss a beat and was great.  Will took the time to explain the menu to us and didn&#39;t make us feel rushed.  We started with the small plate menu as they have a tapas type of feel to them.  We ordered the Tipsy Stuffed Tomato, Crab Cake, and Calamari.. The Tomatoes were good but have a ton of garlic in them. The over powering garlic taste got old after the first few bites but they were still very good.  The crab cake was very good and the calamari came with a soy glaze that gave them a nice sweet taste.  I would order the crab cake and calamari again but would substitute the tomato for something else. From there we split the pork sliders and cubano panini. Both of them were very good and even though I am not a huge fan of coleslaw it was still very good on the sliders. We both had a flight of wine each and enjoyed the selections.

The layout is interesting and fun, I like how there are nooks and larger rooms for different parties or experiences - you can sit in a bar, a dining room, a cozy area or a large space.  

The drinks are reasonably priced - slightly higher for burbs but less than city and you get more in terms of quality and atmosphere.  The food is quite pricey.  DELICIOUS, but pricey.  We ordered a flatbread, crabcakes, salad and a smores dessert.  Everything was very tasty and well presented, although the smores were a little on the sloppy side and not quite what I would expect for the price.  Still yummy.

The staff was knowledgeable if a little slow.  It wasn&#39;t busy when we arrived but picked up throughout the night, but the service didn&#39;t change.  They also had an outdated menu so some of the things we saw that we wanted were not available.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating, we just wished they were a bit more attentive (filling water, noticing empty wine glasses, etc).

There was a small live band playing and the noise in the bar was not excessive.  You should expect some noise a) in a bar and b) when there&#39;s entertainment.  

Overall we really liked Flight 112 and will definitely be back.  We hope management takes notice of the comments on the staff and menu availability - not just mine.  This is a good place but it really could be great!"

Came in recently with a friend because she had gotten a coupon in the mail.  I don&#39;t know if I ever would have made it in otherwise.

The space is quite lovely - the entrance seems to have been recently moved and it was a little confusing but I found my way.  It&#39;s split into a couple of different spaces, one of which is a bar, and then a couple of more private, curtained off dining areas and some other rooms that we did not go and investigate.  There is a lot of art from an amazing local artist on the walls and the remaining walls are really nicely painted.  

We were greeted very promptly by the hostess who also ended up being our server.  We think her name was Nicole and she was awesome (and if that was not your name - I apologize but thanks for being awesome either way).  I really appreciate enthusiasm and knowledge about the menu and she had both of those things.  Very friendly and welcoming on top of it.  She is a definite asset!

The menu is comprised of smaller plates of various things.  They have appetizers and salads and you can build a meat/ cheese board for your starter, if you want to.  We were not that hungry so we went straight to the mains - I had the salmon and it was a reasonable portion, cooked exactly as I like it.  It was a smidge of butter and it felt very decadent without being a huge amount of food, which is a good thing.  For dessert, I tried the apple pie with a scoop of cinnamon ice cream.  Again, not a huge portion, which I appreciated, but it was super delicious.

Oh - and, since the name is Flight112, yes they do have wine.  You can get flights or you can get single glasses.  The Fruity White flight had some pretty yummy stuff in it and the amount for the price is very reasonable.  They also have a pretty good craft beer list if you are not a wine person.

I&#39;m already making plans to go back - it is definitely worth visiting!"

The waiter (very young and nervous) asked if we wanted drinks.  We selected a wine flight which was delivered a few minutes later. Then it seems we were forgotten about.  And this place was dead for a Saturday night. The woman at the next table was complaining to the server about her cold coffee.   Finally we got to order our meals.  The waiter did not know what NGA meant after certain entrees.  So he asked the chef. The chef didn&#39;t know either!!  The chef took our menu up front to the manager to ask.  It means No gluten Availability.  The waiter AND the chef didn&#39;t know.  Yikes!  We ordered our meals. 

 After a short wait I noticed our entrees sitting on the counter waiting to be picked up and served to us. nearly 5 minutes passed while we stared at our entrees from across the room. The bus boy noticed my frustration and came over to check on  me and i asked him if I can have our food. 

The Mac n cheese fritters were average and the pulled pork sliders were tasty.   Waiter never came by to check until we were done. Next up was the grilled flank steak. It&#39;s served on a cutting board. The steak blood ran off of it onto the table. Didn&#39;t bother me but some people it would.  

There was confusion about how to ring up my groupon.  

I won&#39;t go back but thunk others should consider giving it a try. Don&#39;t go if you have a gluten allergy, the chef may kill you accidentally. Lol

They were playing 50s oldies music. Seriously."

We used to frequent before they expanded and a couple times after and it was pretty good service and food.  We went tonight after a movie and our waiter was non-existent most of the night (the other waitress and, what looked to be, the owner was bringing out our drinks and food).  Our waiter, not even 21 yet, didn&#39;t know what was on the draft list, check up on us with basic and i mean BASIC customer service, or even how to use a groupon.  That should&#39;ve been a red flag for me, that they now use groupons.

I can&#39;t speak to the menu as they had a prix fix french menu only available for that day so we had none of the regular menu items. Food was excellent. Service was good but a bit slow. I think the reason for that was due to the volume of people that were there for the event. I would like to go back and try the regular menu. It&#39;s a place you should go when you have the time. I just don&#39;t think it is a place to go and grab a quick bite. Although going for just drinks and appetizers is a real possibility as well.

Prices are reasonable, but maybe a touch on the high side. Nice atmosphere and friendly bartenders. Cute place to start a date night or hang out with girlfriends. 

Charcuterie options are OK but as with most places like this, a little unoriginal and over priced for what you get. A quick trip to Mariano&#39;s or Costco would be cheaper and better. With that said, the bartender accommodated our request to add nuts and honey to the plate, which were great. Definitely try the purple haze! (Which is available at Mariano&#39;s! Haha.)

Didn&#39;t try any other food. The sweet, sweeter, sweetest flight was pretty good. I&#39;d go back to try more flights for sure, but I don&#39;t live in the area."

I probably won&#39;t be going back.  When we walked in there was nowhere to sit except for in a drab looking back room.  We found an open table that was empty aside from the remnants from the previous patrons (clean your tables).  

It took us about 10 minutes to get our drinks, this was after naming off 4 beers on the menu that they were out of; the &#39;bartender&#39; (I use the term loosely) commented on how I must not know much about beer because I was jumping from type to type.  I informed him I was hoping to try something new and if he could just circle the beers they actually had that&#39;d be quite helpful (he didn&#39;t find this amusing).  I decided on Revolution&#39;s Oktoberfest (fifth time&#39;s a charm).

I also ordered the buffalo sliders, they were beyond bland and served with potato chips.  The chips looked like someone trampled them before serving them up.  The entire dish looked like something my 7 year old niece put together.

My beer was good though! 

All in all, dirty table, poor service, train-wreck of a menu, bland food, and a darn good beer."

In addition, a Groupon is cash. I know because I paid quite a bit for it. A coupon and a Groupon can be used together in every other establishment in the country.

I really need to visit Flight 112 more often, especially before these gorgeous evenings are gone.  Flight 112 has a Patio! The shrubs/potted trees and twinkle lights help make the patio a cool and sweet place to spend an evening.  Their small plate menu and wine/craft beer/liquor list still offer a nice array of choices and service was wonderful and helpful. 

I&#39;ve never had a bad glass or wine or a bad martini here. Most recently tried a Malbec on their list and once again very happy with the choice.  Their Chocolate Torte with candied pecans was rich and decadent--stellar.  Their lounge area was hopping with groups of folks sharing their cheese plates and wine.

It&#39;s a lot bigger than it seems from the outside, and it&#39;s decorated nicely. The wine was good although the staff doesn&#39;t seem too knowledgeable, and the food was decent, but nothing special. The problem I had with this place, is that they seem to be super shorthanded. We had a waiter who was very young and inexperienced and I think he was taking care of the entire restaurant that night. You would think that would be the reason we didn&#39;t get very good service, but he seem to be sitting by the computer the entire night. He forgot to put in our order so we waited an extremely long time to get even our appetizers, and even longer time for our dinner which the manager eventually ended up bringing to us. We weren&#39;t checked on by the waiter, and when my husband ordered another drink he didn&#39;t receive it until he was nearly done with his food. There was also a large group of women who came in and were seated next to us. They all sat down and nobody was offered a drink for at least a half hour. I felt really bad for them they came out to have a good time and they weren&#39;t even asked for a drink let alone any food. At one point someone finally came by and brought them waters. I really don&#39;t know what was happening that day. We might have  just tried this place for the first time on a very bad night, but we normally tip 30% average when we go out to dinner,  and I never complain about service.

Tried to ask a few simple questions, but got tired of yelling and being unable to understand the response.  There is a backroom, put Louie Armstrong in the back.  Not able to place an order, we left to return another day.

Return trip a few weeks later, pretty much more of the same.  The space is very tiny and having another full band up front takes up a lot of real estate.  Thankfully these musicians understood they were not playing to the people in the back and we were able to actually place an order.

Service was lackluster to say the least.  How can you run out of 2 of the 3 beers I wanted to order?  That is sad....  It&#39;s Friday, make sure your keg is set.  Come on....  Ordered a plate and was very disappointed with what we received.

The seating in the back room is awkward. The couches they have are soo uncomfortable. The service used to be good, but the last visit was really bad. The waiter gave everything we ordered to the table next to us and everything those people ordered to us. It was a hot mess. Everything had to be second guessed, had to ask for things a few times, and he never knew answers to our questions.  Towards the end we just had to laugh about how bad it was. Good news is he didnt even charge us for the bottle of wine we ordered. I guess having an inexperienced waiter paid off, literally."

What we bought and sampled was OK.I can&#39;t recall the names other than one item was a doughnut. It did not blow me away but I still liked it and would not hesitate to try out a few other items.

The donuts themselves are the awesome, thick cake donuts that have an irresistible sugar crunch when you bite into them. Not only that but they are freshly dipped in chocolate, vanilla, or powdered sugar when you order them. Most typical donut frostings are more like a glaze, which can be nice, but these have a tasty buttercream chocolate frosting like an actual cake - amazing! Oh and definitely ask for sprinkles, you won&#39;t be disappointed.

They offer a wide range of other amazing-looking pastries, breads, cakes, etc that we have yet to try.  I&#39;m not worried though as we will definitely be back to taste test more of their goodies while sitting on their adorable patio."

There&#39;s another bakery close by, and they&#39;re very nice, and their chocolate cake donut is very good and it makes me happy. But you... mercy. 

When I first saw you with the other plain donuts, sitting by the counter, so nondescript and frosting-free, I was unimpressed. Then I found out that you could be dipped in chocolate, and when I first tried you... well, you have likely spoiled me for all other donuts. Even without the wonderful smell, feel and taste of the chocolate frosting, the quality and mouthfeel (some crunch, some chew) of the cake donut itself was divine. Even without your best attribute, you&#39;re incredible.

You&#39;re $1.29 (or so) of ecstasy. Or is it rapture? Either way, I can&#39;t go on like this. If my body would let me, I&#39;d have a dozen of you. Now just one is too much.

Personally, I&#39;ve become giddy glad to have friends &amp; family in the Lilac Village who I need to see and love to see and can swing by places like Balkan Bakery and Cafe on a weekend late morning. The glass case of sinful wonders reminds me of a quaint, beautiful Western European Cafe, all without having to take out and carry my passport.  Had heard all the anticipation attached to opening of this locale and so I stopped in for a quick breakfast. The piping hot robust coffee and apple turnovers were to die for - simply delicious - not too syrupy, but perfectly sweet to be decadently memorable and the perfect morning treat. The coffee, fresh and full-bodied - similar to a cup of Starbucks and shall I say slightly better and that&#39;s just the way I like my coffee best.

The waitresses are very good, the food is okay, and the other employees you may encounter are friendly.  Seems like a nice place.  I like the two baked fish selections they always have: salmon in sauce and a white fish.  They have cartons of various ice cream flavors that makes for a satisfying dessert, too.  

The only concern is that if you enter mid-afternoon, the owner at the register will try to tempt you to pay the dinner price because he is awkwardly strict about not allowing people eating many foods that come out after 3:30.  As you pay for lunch, he points to a list of items he has next to the register and &#34;scolds&#34; that you cannot eat these items if you don&#39;t pay the dinner price! He also has signs put up at 3:30 that basically say, &#34;THIS IS FOR DINNER ONLY!!!&#34;  I&#39;ve never seen any other buffet do that - and I&#39;ve been to a lot of them.  Obviously, as I&#39;ve told the owner, the problem is that when the dinner items come out, many of the lunch items are taken away.  So, there isn&#39;t a whole lot of entree items left out after 3:30 that people have paid for in the lunch price.  (And, I prefer the lunch selections over the &#39;fancier&#39; dinner items anyway and would like to still be able to get them after 3:30.)  

Beyond that, he crams all the lunch patrons into one small section of the restaurant and then opens another section for the dinner patrons after 3:30, so it appears.  This is probably so he can keep track of who can and who can&#39;t eat the dinner items.  It&#39;s not comfortable the way he does it.  Last time I was there, I asked again if I could eat on &#34;the other side&#34; where it wasn&#39;t packed with patrons, and I was adamantly told &#34;NO.&#34;  

This owner needs to do like other buffet owners and just change over to dinner when he raises the price - knowing that some people who came in on the lunch price are going to get some of (what he thinks is) the &#34;better&#34; food.  Another option would be to issue a Dinner Pass to persons who pay more after 3:30 and have servers give the &#34;better&#34; food via the Dinner Pass - until all the lunch patrons have cleared out.  Bottom line: there&#39;s got to be a much, much better way for this &#34;very frugal&#34; owner to do this!  A much better way!"

If you go to a buffet of this sort you are not expecting the same type of atmosphere or service that you would at a fine dining establishment but keep in mind that you are talking about spending not much more than you would at a fast food place. I could see if you were comparing it to a restaurant where you would spend $50 a person but come on people it&#39;s a Chinese Buffet and they are throwing in a Hibachi Grill and Sushi too! 

Here is my detailed review: Yesterday my husband and I had the opportunity to try out the Osaka Grill &amp; Supreme Buffet in Bolingbrook IL. It is located right next to the Goodwill store at 121 S. Weber Rd.

We were expecting a typical Chinese buffet place but what we got was so much more. We went on a weekend so perhaps they have a bit more than on weekdays. I did not check the weekday prices but the weekend price was $11.99 per person (soft drinks are extra). It seemed a little steep for a Chinese buffet but when I got in I saw why. (you pay before you sit down)

Not only was this an extensive Chinese buffet including all that you would expect plus a fully stocked salad and fresh fruit bar. One thing I was not expecting was a grill area where you put raw ingredients on a plate and they cook it for you, sort of like Mongolian Barbecue. The other surprise was a section for Sushi. Lastly there was a dessert bar with ice cream and other cakes and pastries to choose from.

We do not eat sushi but we did use the grill and that was delicious. They had steak shrimp and chicken plus a variety of veggies, rice, and noodles.

In the main area of the buffet they even had a roast beef although it was self serve. It was a bit tough to carve but we did get a couple pieces and it was quite good.

They have a variety of seating options and the seating is separated from the buffet area in small sections. We chose a booth which was very comfortable.

We will definitely be going back to the Osaka Grill &amp; Supreme Buffet"

It&#39;s different. You have to give them a little slack because buffets are inherently gross. 

This place has a siiiiick selection. Easily 30+ dishes plus sushi and hibachi. Overall I feel like it&#39;s pretty good standard fare. Emphasis on standard. 

A few noteworthy points:
- you pay before you sit down. The line to get in was hella long at like 5:15 on a Saturday, so prepare yourself. 
- yes, I eat at 5:15 pm. Judge me silently!!!
- there were a lot of people dressed up there. It was weird. I was basically wearing sweats and hoarding crab rangoons next to a dapper fellow in a three piece suit. 
- this place is pretty cheap for a buffet. Like $12/person? Something like that
- you may get the worst server of all time who can not get your drink order right a single time in the evening. You can&#39;t be mad because it&#39;s a $12 buffet. And because he almost cried every time you have to correct him with the right drink which makes you laugh and feel sad at the same time."

First of all, finding the place. It&#39;s awkwardly placed right next to a Goodwill, with the two entrances side-by-side. Never saw a set-up like that, but I guess it works. I&#39;d also never seen a lotto machine right next to a kid&#39;s crane game, yet you also see that in Osaka.

Like I said, not too much exciting. Per usual, stay away from the &#34;American&#34; food and the not so fresh sushi. They awkwardly have a prime rib in one of their trays, which is rough to cut with your option of fork, spoon, or chopsticks (you need to ask for the knife).

The Chinese/Asian fare they have here is passable enough. Crab rangoon, black pepper chicken, sauteed mushrooms, chicken and broccoli. Nothing too surprising, but as a lover of crappy Chinese food I was satisfied.

Osaka isn&#39;t something I&#39;d make a trip for, but for the purpose it served this past weekend (that is, feeding a couple dozen friends and family) it did its job."

Almost like a blind date...shoot low but aim high. Aim high meaning do not get food poisioning!  

We came on a Saturday with a group of people for a birthday party and ate their lunch buffet.The service was meh...but so is every buffet. This buffet had a pretty decent salad bar, which is kind of odd for an Asian buffet. The hot food items were okay. Nothing spectacular. The odd thing about this place is that most of the food was meh okay....except their crab ragoon, yeast rolls, roast beef, and mashed potatoes.  Yes,  those 4 items tasted pretty damn delicious. Who knew you could find tasty mashed potatoes at an Asian buffet? 

So why the 2 stars then? Not the best food I ever had and pretty much your average Asian buffet. Would I ever take the effort to go there when in Boilingbrook....naahhh"

Unfortunately it didn&#39;t live up to the great smell. First off as far as the wait staff  and the cashier, everyone was pleasant , but the food on the other hand was terrible. I took two pieces of everything because it is a buffet and that is what your there for to try different things. Only things that were good was the egg rolls, orange slices,and the little square cake. The food looked old in its trays and gross. I don&#39;t mean to sound harsh but it was just terrible. The bread left a bad after taste in my mouth and the ice cream was awful.

Unlike most dime-a-dozen Chinese buffet type restaurants, Osaka was always more hits than misses.  Until this year; I&#39;m not sure what happened, but I don&#39;t like it.

First, cleanliness and upkeep have gone to the wayside.  Furniture, walls, tables, fixtures, and rugs are all showing signs of age and disrepair.  (Think deep gouges in the walls, and extremely wobbly chairs.)  While the area around the hot buffet is clean, the ice cream bar and desert bar can get particularly nasty.

Secondly, service has gotten spotty.  While the hostess who brings you to your table is always nice, would it hurt the cashiers to pretend they would rather interact with the customer instead of their iPhones?  Wait/bus persons are hot and cold.  One minute you are fawned over, the next, forgotten.  Plenty of times I&#39;ve seen people stack up used plates on adjacent unoccupied tables just to get them out of their way.

You are going to need your server on their beverage refill game, since the food has become much saltier than it was in the past, which was one of the reasons for its high marks to begin with.  The sushi preparation has changed too.  Now the rolls are mushy, and fall apart at the first contact of soy sauce.

I&#39;ve stayed away for a month or two now, after my last two visits confirmed the downhill slide.  Lo and behold, I received a Clipper Magazine in the mail the other day, with a full page ad including coupons, to the newly remodeled and under new management Osaka Buffet. Hopefully, a visit to the &#34;new&#34; place can restore my opinion to its former glory."

However, that is no longer the case. For my wife and I, and two young daughters (1 &amp; 3), our total came to $34 and some change. In hindsight, I would not have paid $10 for our entire meal. There is such a range of food there that I could just go on and on if I were to tell you everything that was wrong with each dish, so I will keep it simple. The quality of the food was terrible. And when I say terrible, I am comparing the food to other buffets...not nice restaurants.

I arrived at Osaka to find it practically hidden under a Goodwill sign, it actually looked like Osaka was part of the Goodwill with the way the sign and doors were places. When I stepped inside I noticed a large buffet and when walking to my table I quickly noticed the Oreo dirt cake, which I had to save room for.

As far as the food goes it was pretty average, nothing great. It served its purpose however what saved Osaka from a two star rating was the desert selection. I noticed a large variety however I skipped over everything and went right to the Oreo dirt cake, it was awesome. Not something I have seen before at a Chinese buffet but it hit the spot!

While the food was overall pretty good and the pricing about par, I thought they had a limited selection of actual Chinese food dishes versus other buffets.

They had plenty of sushi, hibachi and sweets options, but as it came to plates of varying Chinese dishes, it was lacking in my opinion.  Not that you couldn&#39;t get full on it, but you&#39;ll get full on the same foods.

The workers were nice and the restaurant in itself was clean and had a lot of seatings.  

There are other buffets in the area that have a wider selection, but if you want to go for price or know you want the regular Chinese fare, then this is a fine option for you."

The meat and vegetables were fresh and filled, the chef was quick and pleasant. 

I didn&#39;t try the sushi as I am paranoid enough when dining in a buffet. 

The buffet itself is rather large with a variety of food including seafood, salad, and deserts. Most of it looked old and dried out. 
My favorite item on the buffet was the octopus salad, just so I could gross out my kids. Actually it&#39;s fresh and really was a decent dish. They also had shrimp and crab when I was there. (Tip: always go for the seafood and meat and skip the salad while dining buffet style, for the best value). 

As others have posted, the service and cleanliness is hit or miss, they are really nice up front and at first, but then it seems to slide at the table. Or stick, as in &#34;what the heck is on this table and floor&#34;?

The selections were also average to lower than average quality, but hey, it was only $10.60 pp for dinner, so one really can&#39;t complain that much.  The seafood spaghetti and fried frog legs were particularly pretty bad tasting.  I did find most of the chicken items to be decent quality -  items like fried chicken, crispy chicken, orange chicken, etc and I would personally stick to those for a cheap meal outing here.

- Lesson Learned! 
Dinner Buffet $9.99 + $1.67 (drink) = Deceiving Deal

... So I made a trip back to the suburbs to visit family. One of my relatives mentioned seeing a flyer for a new buffet that opened up nearby. Naturally, our curiosity would lead us to try it out. Now I am kicking myself in the ass for biting my tongue and not suggesting an alternate dinner option. 

Let&#39;s talk about Osaka.

Driving up to the location, you see a sign but no door? That&#39;s because it sort of shares its entrance with the Goodwill next door that totally takes over everything. (maybe foreshadowing?) Once you finally find the door, you are greeted with a &#34;stone&#34; fountain and a peculiar smell (equivalent to &#34;new car&#34;). At Osaka you pay before you eat.. I don&#39;t see this often, but I also haven&#39;t frequented buffets in a while. So that&#39;s whatever. There&#39;s private seating sections towards the entrance and a lot of seating elsewhere so I guess that&#39;s nice. The decor is reminiscent of Vegas circa 1998. Blaring neon lights .. repeat of misspelled food labels (see photo).. etc. 

Well onto the food..
There&#39;s several stations set up with a lot of offerings which caters to people with many tastes. Cool, but that does me no benefit if the food is near unpalatable. A lot of things taste weird, or are just plain terrible. The sushi was offensive.. I got a big bite of rice and cream cheese...  and the fish, well. fishy.

Chinese dishes are probably their strongest suit (which is funny b/c the place is called Osaka which is a city in Japan..) but in this case I use &#34;strong&#34; loosely. Stir fries are mediocre, egg rolls rancid, etc. luckily I took bite sized portions of most things.. They also managed to botch &#34;Hot and Soure&#34; soup.. (their spelling, not mine). 

Salad bar is underwhelming and the American section offers some suspect &#34;Prime Rib&#34; (actually, just big chunks of beef slow cooked in broth) and a huge pork loin that&#39;s overcooked and monotone. 

The only thing I honestly enjoyed there were the spicy crayfish.. but they were salty as hell. I found myself full after downing 3 glasses of water (which I had to pay for).

Let&#39;s just say, I personally won&#39;t be returning. But if you&#39;re looking for something to fill you up quick, and cleanse your digestive tract even faster.. this place will do the trick. 

Best of luck!"

The decor comments all remain the same.  I still sort of imagine a stripper could potentially climb down from the ceiling.

The buffet food is somewhat better than it was a year or two ago.  The sushi has improved, too.  It tastes a bit fresher than before, which is always a good thing.  &#34;If it smells like bass, pass...&#34;  lol.

If you eat too much of the buttery, greasy, creamy food, you can still expect to spend some time near the Porcelain Princess (aka your toilet).  I don&#39;t know what it is with some of that food, everyone seems to get loose poopy-do&#39;s.  Is that just a Chinese food thing?  If so, I&#39;ll update the review again.  Otherwise, I&#39;m just going for the sushi and egg rolls.  So when ya&#39;ll see the check-ins, know it&#39;s for the sushi.

I didn&#39;t try their sushi or the hibachi grill.

It was pretty clean and very bright in there which is a good thing and the waiter was pretty good and quick. It&#39;s not a very expensive place. I paid $12 for lunch today including a drink and tax. My tummy isn&#39;t hurting thus far which is good and I pray it doesn&#39;t even attempt to start. 

If you&#39;ve been curious about this place, go ahead and try it. It&#39;s not a bad place at all but I will say their pictures on the webpage totally gives it a different flare than they really are. In other words, the web designer has quite the imagination. Lol. I don&#39;t blame them though."

We should step back and note the price before making huge culinary jumps here, the lunch buffet was $6.99 with the drink $9 bucks and some change, so, no - you aren&#39;t going to get a gourmet meal, but the price and value is good.

They had 4 tables of hot food, including all the Chinese food staples you would expect, some good seafood options, including a really good dish with shrimp, krab (you know that imitation crab food), calamari and scallops. 

They had a salad bar and a desert bar (didn&#39;t try anything there).  

The place was friendly, clean and, in my opinion worth a try!"

Here at Osaka I can NOT say that. I&#39;m not a super food snob but I don&#39;t eat bad food. One day I decided to pop in and eat here with a good friend of mine for dinner. People always talk about Osaka so I decided to give it a try despite me already having a great Chinese place already in Bolingbrook (Golden Chopsticks). My fountain drink was slightly watery. Food was mediocre and a lot of the dishes were empty and needed replacing. They have a person towards the back behind the buffet making &#34;sushi&#34;. I grabbed a couple pieces of different rolls and they were disgusting. Sushi is not supposed to be warm unless it&#39;s a cooked roll and room temperature sushi isn&#39;t good either for cooked or raw. I have seen a kid be rushed out of this restaurant by their parent so the kid could vomit. Parent said the kid was getting sick from the food. To be honest I was not surprised. Overall I haven&#39;t been back and don&#39;t plan on going back. I&#39;d go to the place near IL-53 and Lily Cache  for Chinese and for people who enjoy sushi I would recommend KO on Boughton across from Five Guys and Target. Hate to leave a bad review but I can&#39;t let people waste money on bad quality

I always get my moneys worth every time I go to one. I have a hearty appetite and I enjoy the variety. As far as far east buffets go, they are pretty much all standard, average fare and there is not much differences in quality. This place was a little different. 

All of the stuff I tried was either a home run or a strikeout. For example, the slightly dry cake and the seafood spaghetti was bad as in really bad. The baked fish and the orange chicken was outstanding! It was not what I expected from a buffet. It was much better. The home runs far outnumbered the strikeouts! 

Everything was was fresh and very nicely displayed. The buffet and the restaurant was kept very clean. Our server did a very good job of keeping our large party&#39;s drinks full and they were very attentive! I will gladly be back!"

You know what to expect, and Osaka is no different. The staff at the entrance were rude and hard to communicate with. The cheaper price point might seem like a good deal, but don&#39;t forget they charge you for drinks. 

The food variety was plentiful, but nearly all of it was bland or over-salted, and definitely not kept at the right temperature for safety. There are very many better choices nearby; you&#39;ll get a better meal for your money at the nearby Panda Express if your yen is for Chinese food."

I&#39;m never dissatisfied. The buffet selection is good but not great, but for the price you really can&#39;t go wrong when you consider the hibachi and sushi. Most of the food is kept well-stocked so you don&#39;t see a lot of empty trays there, with the exception of the cake.

Plenty of Hibachi items, a variety of sushi, and the regular items you&#39;d expect (orange chicken, lo mein, crab rangoon, squid, and so on), as well as the pizza, macaroni and cheese, etc. for picky eaters.

My main complaint is that I end up eating too much whenever I go here, but that&#39;s my own fault and not theirs. Another minor complaint I have is that when I was there once they were playing Taylor Swift&#39;s Christmas album in the dining room, and it was on repeat. In February.

But all in all, this is my preferred place to eat."

Wow! What a disgusting meal! I mean, I guess, I couldn&#39;t have expected much for $9.99 all you can eat. But I mean basically everything was inedible. I very rarely spit out food but just had to -- a few times.

The sushi--yuck, yuck, yuck.
The American stuff --how do you mess up food service prefrozen food? You don&#39;t, you buy the cheap ish.
Salad bar-- disgusting! They mix ice cubes in with their lettuce and greens. Here&#39;s an idea--get a refrigerated buffet.

There was really a lack of veggies. I felt disgusted. I also felt bad that I didn&#39;t eat the food on my plate. Luckily, I only took one piece of anything at a time.

The waitress was really nice though. She was extremely helpful and very friendly. Her name is Anna, I think."

The place looked impressive enough when we entered. Very large dining area with several rooms off to the side, lots of neon directing you to the Hibachi grill area and sushi bar. I found myself looking for the slot machines though.

There were 6 tables full of food. A huge selection of Chinese and American dishes. There was a lot of seafood done so many ways. I took a small sample of many dishes back to the table along with a nbowl of sweet and sour soup. Right off you could tell that items like the spring rolls, egg rolls and wontons were frozen and not of high quality. The sushi was suspect, all the fish had a fishy odor and taste. I couldn&#39;t even choke down one piece. Some of the stir fry tasted okay so I stuck with that. I went for some fresh fruit after my stir fry. The pineapple was okay but the strawberries I took were soft.

The worst part of the day was the reaction my wife and I both had to the amount of MSG we must have taken in while dining. We were both swollen and bloated the rest of the day and were unable to eat anything else until the next morning. We had our lunch there at 12:30 in the afternoon and it simply did us in. We have never had a reaction like that eating at any other Chinese Buffets. 

Obviously we won&#39;t be going back."

Every table was pretty much occupied at the resturant..... Finally took a stroll to the buffet line......salad, dessert, fried food, noodles, soup, sea food, and much more.....too much to choose from! I started off with my salad moved on to the hibachi rice, hibachi chicken and a slice of pizza....also did the sesame balls.....MMMMM GOOD! 

Everything that I had was pretty much good and hot(temp). Won ton soup was decent.

This place was not as &#34;ghetto&#34; as the many buffets in the city which I tend to avoid since quality has dropped. It was crowded, but not too many kids running around. Looking forward to going back as long as quality remains the same or better...

Bathrooms also clean....for now..."

The first time was on their opening weekend in June.  It was packed and the food wasn&#39;t flavorful, but it was well organized.  Wasn&#39;t bad considering they just opened the day before.

Since then, the food has improved in quality and taste.  It&#39;s $6.99 for mid-week lunch and drinks are extra.  

My favorites are the rice noodles, pepper chicken, fried sweet potatoes, baby bok choy, green beans, mushroom fried rice and pork chops.  My 14 year old daughter makes a heck of a veggie noodle dish at the hibachi.  ( I steal from her plate when she&#39;s not looking! )

The ice cream is delish and there is a nice peanuts in caramel crunch bar on the dessert table.  There is a brilliant salad and fruit bar that I need to try next time.  The Asian diners eat fruit instead of ice cream.  ( Yes, I&#39;m Asian, but I&#39;m an ice cream eating Asian. )

I&#39;m going to start this off by pointing out that I don&#39;t eat a lot when I go out to eat, so buffet style restaurants are almost always a rip off for me. Osaka has a lot of different options for food most of which look and taste like cafeteria food. The Asian dishes are better than the non-asian fair, but that&#39;s not saying a whole lot. The sushi, when it is fresh, is actually quite good, but when It&#39;s not so fresh it&#39;s not so good. I haven&#39;t yet tried the Hibachi bar, but I&#39;ve heard good things. On the issue of dessert they have a bunch of options, and because it is SO hard to mess up dessert the dessert at least always tastes good. However, again it is nothing to right home about. It tastes like it came out of a box which it most likely did. I wouldn&#39;t go out of your way to come to this place, but I wouldn&#39;t avoid it either.

I called in advance for two reasons: to see if they had American food (specifically fried chicken) for 2 of the people in our party. And, to see if they would let me pay for the weight of my food due to the fact I had weight loss surgery and can only eat 4 ounces of food.  BC Osaka in Joliet let me get a take out container and pay for the weight of my food while the rest of the party eats from the buffet the traditional way. Osaka would only agree to let me pay the $5.65 kids meal.  At BC Osaka my total was $1.88.
Next, we noticed that there was NO fried chicken and the crab legs that were pictured in their advertisement were nowhere to be found.  Only some tiny hollow, cold crab in pieces that were impossible to eat! My Mother in Law made a stink about the chicken so they agreed to make some...AN HOUR LATER, when we were ready to leave, they came with a plate of chicken!

 - not in the same league as Royal buffet or Nagoya buffet

 - $9.95 dinner price probably a newcomer strategy to entice low-income or blue-collar families.  Situated in Bolingbrook &amp; next door to Goodwill are give away hints.

 - aggressive marketing flyers, with $1.00 off lunch &amp; $1.50 off dinner coupons (we used a single coupon for a party of 25 people, but the cashier would not allow us to get food until everyone in the party has arrived)

 - entree and dessert selections were mediocre, not meant to attract any particular Asian ethnic groups. For example, no special ice cream flavors such as red bean, green tea, or taro.

Atmophere is okay, soft drink is extra charge.  

I believe most Asians would rather spend few more bucks and dine at Royal instead.  Nevertheless, Osaka is great place to pig-out for budget-conscious family dinner outing."

The decor is for sure something that you would expect to see in a casino, but that really wasn&#39;t what was important to me.  I quickly found my seat and dove right in.  There are tons of dishes here, but there are quite a few that I wouldn&#39;t touch to save my life.  All of the chicken dishes were good: sweet and sour chicken, general tso&#39;s chicken, etc.  The sushi looked mediocre at best and the couple of pieces that I did try made me worry about getting sick, so I quickly ditched that.  I also decided that I would try some grilled octopus, but that was completely inedible.   One thing that this place has that most of these kind of buffets don&#39;t have is a create-your-own hibachi station.  I figured that you can&#39;t really go wrong with grilled meat and veggies, so I got in line.  You take a plate and pile everything that you want onto it and then hand it to the person behind the grill and he whips it up for you.  He is also cooking several other people&#39;s orders at the same time, so there is a good chance that you will find a stray ingredient that you didn&#39;t put on your plate in your order.  Also it is important to note that they don&#39;t put any seasoning besides soy sauce on the food, so mine came out rather bland. They had a great salad bar, dessert bar (ice cream included) and a couple of decent dishes.  However they also had a lot of not so great dishes - so if you can go and feel like you got your moneys worth on a couple of dishes that you really like, I guess that is a good thing.  However, I will say that there are plenty of similar buffets that do this concept much better."

A change that would improve things - I wish there was a little more control over the children that come with their parents.  I&#39;m not sure what Osaka can do in this regard. Hey parents!  This is a restaurant, not a playground.  The signage on the offerings have improved significantly, but maybe could be a touch better.  And, lastly, once again I WAS NOT charged for water!

I work in nearby Westchester and there is really a limited selection when it comes to good lunch options. 

The store front is for them to sell most of their house made items which include soups and the vegan burgers. They try to locally source as much as possible and try to get as much organic as possible. It is more of a little store but they have some hot food items for lunch. 

I am not 100% if/when they have more options on their menu, but their cruciferous crunch vegan burger [done in a wrap] is absolutely delicious. I am not vegan but this burger does not leave you missing the meat at all. Mixed with tons of veggies [beans/sweet potatoes/peas/etc.] and great flavor. The wrap is made with the burger, spinach, roasted red peppers and giardiniera [if you would like]. Also really great portion size for the pricing. I believe the wrap is $6; however, I got it &#39;danimal style&#39; which is with a fried egg and cheese [definitely get it that way]. The total for the wrap was $8. 

I would pick this wrap over Protein Bar [or another &#39;health&#39; food place] every time. The pricing was cheaper, the wrap leaves you full much longer, and the food was better , fresher, and wayyyy tastier than anything at Protein Bar. The main owner/Chef - Dan - is also super friendly and nice.

Very excited to have the Eating Well nearby and I already crave it!"

vanilla bean cheese cake- melted in my mouth

Cauliflower soup and 3 mushroom soup- mixed them together with a little coriander, turmeric, and lemon slice.  - so fresh and yummy!

Two burgers (pre cooked and purchase frozen) the kale/rapini and the spicy burger. Both were really tasty, but the spicy one was  more flavorful and held together better more like a burger. 

I really wish the owner offered other items like sauces: fresh pesto sauce or ghee, or spices. I eat aryvedically so it is always a challenge getting items or if I do not feel like cooking. I will be a frequent customer. The owner is very nice and helpful!"

Had no idea that this was under new ownership and was surprised to see the natural wood paneling  painted over with red paint (?!). Very ugly, looks like an elementary schoolroom now. They removed the wall between the bar and the restaurant and I asked a waiter why and he was unclear as to the reason it was done. The place wasn&#39;t busy and it was a Sunday afternoon but I can imagine when the bar does get busy it&#39;s going to be quite loud for the rest of the diners. They weren&#39;t serving drinks at the time which is unusual and several diners left when they were told that upon entry. I&#39;m sure this is a temporary thing though. They still have the screened in porch and since it was a nice day there were several diners there.

I&#39;m still giving this place a 4 star review because the food hasn&#39;t changed. Our group got the loaded nachos as an appetizer  (includes queso as well as melted cheese!)  and then we all ordered the brisket because it&#39;s just that good! Wait staff was pleasant as usual.  I saw a recent review here that says that gray ceramic tile is being added to the dining area. I hope that means on the walls to cover up that red paint!

They should have waited to advertise till they were done with remodal &amp; menu changes. Though the remodeling has nothing to do with that, because the tables were clean. 

Walked in around 830pm. Says open till 10 or 11. Asked to make sure kitchen was open, &amp; hostess/bartender wasnt sure. Went to ask someone, who was not really happy that there was two people wanting to eat, but said they would serve us (Better to have convo quietly so guests cant hear). Sat down, waitress/bartender was nice. 

Ordered food, poppers for app, Chicken fajitas for him &amp; pulled pork for me (on recommendation from the waitress). I also got cup of soup (cheddar broccoli), which was burnt and curdled. The fajitas had no seasoning at all, minus some salt &amp; pepper sprinkled on them. Mostly it was green peppers and onions, only 5 strips of chicken (grilled). However, the lettuce &amp; tomato were fresh so that was good. The pulled pork was good, but not good enough for me to go back just for it. The poppers were great though.

I think this place has potential, &amp; hooe the new owners can turn it around. I will try this place again in the future, &amp; will update my review accordingly."

I got a chicken sandwich that was very well cooked.  It was supposed to be a bit spicy, and it wasn&#39;t, but it was still flavorful and the chicken wasn&#39;t dry,  which is the usual state of restaurant chicken sandwiches.  They had a great selection of side dishes to accompany your burger/sandwich of choice, including fried zucchini.  The beer list is decent, as other yelpers have mentioned.  The atmosphere is fun - a bit kitschy with a western theme.  We sat on the screened in porch and had a very pleasant experience.

( I&#39;m sorry, not a good name for this place, is it a Samurai Movie or dining? ) And they butchered &#34;The Range Western&#34; feel , by doing the worse thing you can do to a Restaurant, &#34;Not know what you want to be&#34;  Is it a Sports bar ? There are now TV&#39;s in Dining area, and the Bar is now part of the Dining area. Is it Fine Dining ? The tables have white paper covers. The bar use to be cozy and private from the Dining, now there are bright Neon beer signs and a view to the dining area patrons eating :( The Service was average, the Servers looked a bit unkept, and the floor was very dirty. The food was average but served luke warm at best. It&#39;s very loud/Noisy , since they have turned it into one big room with tables, which also makes it less private.

I&#39;m gonna miss the Western theme of &#34;the Range&#34; and the good Chili."

Secondly, the waitress brought out my other sons food and spilled the fries on the table.  She proceeded to pick up the fries with her hands and put them back on his plate.

Third, my wife ordered the fish tacos.  They were the most obnoxiously big tacos I have ever seen.  Basically, they fried up a giant piece of fish and put it on taco.  I&#39;ve never seen anything quite like it.  

Lastly, the food is way overpriced.  We were there to try the place once and this will be the last.  Awful!"

Server Sarah P was very professional, knowledgeable, helpful and cute.
Try the brisket poppers -were different and delicious!
Prime rib was perfect 
Brisket was amazingly 
My wife&#39;s salad was crisp fresh and the chicken was warm, a nice plus.
Chicken sandwich was yum.
The burger buns were amazing.
I was really impressed with the customer service skills of the young staff. Someone has taken a lot if time to refine. Plates were cleared fast and friendly.
Amazing staff.
Beer specials $2 even in a Saturday night.
Not a thing I can say that was negative.
What a joy!
Personable and genuine!

You&#39;re not going to find a ton of beer you haven&#39;t tried before (if you&#39;re a beer snob like me) but there are good choices and a couple you may not have seen nonetheless. 

We came here Sunday right before the (opening) Bears Packers game. Totally thought they&#39;d be packed and we&#39;d have to wait but no one was here! I mean, awesome for me, but not so much for management. It kind of scared me that I picked a dive with crappy food but apparently The Range is just slightly off the grid enough to be a secret because they have absolutely awesome food. Seriously...the burger here was one of the best I&#39;ve ever had. I got the Honky Tonk (add blue cheese!) and it was fantastic. A delicious seasoned patty, cooked medium (which you ask for but rarely get at most places), ooey gooey with sauce and cheese and runny egg, and topped with nice thick crispy bacon. Mmmmmm.  I&#39;m having a mouthgasm just thinking about it. My man got the brisket and thought it was great too. We even got a free kids meal with our adult meal purchase (maybe a Sunday deal?) and she mangia&#39;ed on those chicken nuggets like they were going out of style. Point is, we will be back for the food alone. 

For those who care about service and ambiance: Service from the waitress was alright. If it were busy it may have been a different story, but it was dead in there so it was good enough. The owner stopped by a couple times too to run food, ask about refills, and make sure everything was cool. He was genuinely really nice and cared that you were having a good time. Nice touch. The ambiance was very hunting cabin with a summery party twist. You know, wood, antlers, drinking signs, kitschy stuff. I don&#39;t care either way as long as the food is good but if you need something fancy, this place isn&#39;t for you. 

Overall, The Range is awesome.  Go here. But don&#39;t tell TOO many friends because I still don&#39;t want to wait for a table."

I had the strawberry beer to start- something I&#39;d never tried before- and I really enjoyed the drink.

We were there on the night of a Chicago Blackhawks playoff game- and the bar was very crowded while the rest of the restaurant was not. I feel like this would be a great place to sit on the porch outside, but we wanted to watch the end of the game so opted to sit inside. Our server was very pleasant, and our food was a-ok. I enjoyed my entree and tempura zucchini side but was less crazy about the corn based side- I probably wouldn&#39;t get that again. My husband had a burger which he couldn&#39;t finish- one of the specialties of the house- and he loved his dish. I probably would have given my dinner 3 stars- but with excellent service and a four start dish for my spouse- I&#39;m doing 4 overall. I&#39;d definitely like to come back and try some of the other menu items- and with the close proximity to the local movie theater, we just might!"

Nice ambiance and really good bar environment. The appetizers are great to pair with beer. I am not 21 however, so I just ordered some milk. They gave me half a glass, which I was disappointed about. Our waitress seemed a little ditsy, as she kept coming back and reminding us that she&#39;s waiting on our food. Obviously, otherwise our food would be in front of us... But when we did get our food, I couldnt wait to dig in. Their burgers are huge and cooked pretty accurately to my direction. They did however have a charred outer coating, which you could palpably taste and I would rather do without. Our check was prompt and our waitress was very nice despite the lack of experience she may have. I would go there again."

Service was good for the most part, but when 2 of us ran out of beer and ordered another, none was brought.  The owner came over and immediately brought us beers, can&#39;t ask for more than that, the rest of the service was good.  The beer menu is great with a lot of micro brews and harder to find beers.  The food is great, the burger comes in a cast iron skillet and was cooked to perfection, my friend got the beef brisket and the portion was absolutely huge and he said it was delicious.

On Sunday afternoon, we visited nearby St. Charles for the annual Scarecrow Festival. It was my birthday and so I got to be the decision maker. After the fest, we headed over to Batavia to try what sounded like some yummy food at the Open Range American Grill. 

The parking lot has an odd shape and minimal spots, but there were spots on the street and what appeared to be more parking across the way. We parked on the street and wandered in. There were no customers. Uh oh. Now what?  Do the five of us turn and leave?  The reviews were good so we stuck it out. 

I&#39;m glad we did.

We sat at a large table in the bar area. We had a perfect view of a large screen tv and plenty of elbow room. That was a plus. People slowly filled in the space. The Bears weren&#39;t playing and it was mid-afternoon on a Sunday so I think we may have just been there at an off time. 

The menu had a nice variety of items. I wanted the crab cakes. I know, what&#39;s wrong with me?  Ordering crab cakes at what appears to be a bar that serves food rather than a restaurant which serves drinks. I asked the server. Her menu knowledge was somewhat limited and she described the crab cakes as: um, mushy and not really what you&#39;d expect. Okay - no crab cakes for me. 

I ended up with a plain chicken sandwich and some onion strings. It was good. Nothing fancy or memorable, but it served its purpose. My son ordered a California club and roasted veggies. He was a fan of the whole dish. The hubby and my sister went with beef brisket. This dish came with the option of two sides. He chose chili and baked beans (said he&#39;d come back for the beans) and she chose chili and fries (the waffle cut fries did not impress but the chili was a hit).  My brother in law chose a steak sandwich with baked beans. It arrived with sweet potato fries in error. Getting the correct beans took some effort, but we worked it out eventually. 

The server encouraged the tempura zucchini. We tried it as an appetizer with a chipotle ranch dipping sauce. It was tasty but I&#39;m glad that no one chose that as their side. It was too greasy. 

Overall, the beer selection was wide, the menu options plentiful and the service was okay. I wouldn&#39;t necessarily make this a destination restaurant but I would probably visit again if I was in the area."

First, for an appetizer, we ordered the Brisket Poppers, and they did not have any brisket in them. They were pretty good otherwise, but we could not seem to find the meat!

We brought our 4 kids with us tonight, as kids were to eat free off the kids menu, but it is only one kids meal per one adult meal, which is ok, but not stated anywhere until the final bill came.  Also, the menu has a large burger selection, but there is no kids burger, so we had to pay 10.99 to get a cheeseburger for one of our kids, not the end of the world, but to note.

In regards to food, the brisket and pulled pork are marginal at best. My wife had the pork, and I had the brisket. The brisket was dry and flavorless, and pork was decent, with a smokey flavor. Those who know BBQ know that the sides can also make the meal. There were not any original sides to note, and when I asked about the &#34;Corn and Queso&#34;, the waitress said she has never tried it, but heard it was good. When it came, it was canned corn with a slice of american cheese melted on top via microwave. Not so good, couldn&#39;t even get through it.

I hear that the burgers are good, but my 8 year old said &#34;Portillos is better&#34;... Take that for what it is worth.

Overall, most of the food did not some homemade, and tasted the same.

Don&#39;t think we will be back."

The parking lot is just stupid. Do yourself a favor and park on the street and walk. 

As we neared the front of the restaurant we could smell the food and being that we were ALL starving, we made our way in quickly....to an empty restaurant. I thought maybe they were closed. Seriously...where are all the people? The scarecrow fest, maybe? Did we come at a weird time? Maybe. We can&#39;t just leave, so we took a seat but not before using the ladies room. Which I have to say is just weird...its like they took several rooms and put them together, the door frame isn&#39;t finished and there are openings near the floorboards, the soap dispenser is broken and the light is flickering like we were in a fun house...I was so weirded out for a minute! My sister and I just laughed it off and joined the boys at a large table in the bar area where they could see whatever game was on that day.

The server was honest in her opinions, which I normally appreciate but she wasn&#39;t really selling us on anything in the menu, so I was kinda turned off. My sister asked how the crab cakes were and she said &#39;kinda mushy&#39; and &#39;not what you would expect&#39;. Needless to say, she chose something else on the menu. The server did recommend the tempura zucchini which is technically a &#39;side&#39; option but she said it also worked as an appetizer if we wanted to try it, so we did. For $3, it was great! Only issue was that it was greasy..it needed more time to, I don&#39;t know, drain? 

My self and my brother-in-law copied each other and both ordered the beef brisket. It was VERY fatty, but it was VERY good. It basically fell apart so it was easy to get the meat and cut off the fat. I ordered the waffle fries and their chili. The chili was my favorite thing of the whole meal. I would go back for the chili alone. The waffle fries left something to be desired. My husband&#39;s meal came with the wrong side so after waiting a while and him getting further and further into in steak sandwich without being able to enjoy his side along with it, we had to get up to find the missing server to have her correct the issue. Everyone else left satisfied, but I got the impression from the birthday girl that she was not a big fan of her dish, so I felt really bad that we ventured out of our safe zone restaurants on her birthday. Next year, we&#39;re going somewhere we know and love!"

I&#39;ve lamented the demise of Geneva&#39;s Rib House several years ago. Meaty, juicy barbecued baby backs at a price an ordinary guy can afford have been all but impossible to find. But no longer!  Range Grill is a friendly place where the owner manager  seems always to be in the house produces some really good food at reasonable prices, delivered by people who make you feel that they are really glad you wandered in.  
I&#39;ve enjoyed the brisket and brisket sandwich, and the Friday fish fry, but the baby back ribs are my current favorite. (I&#39;ve yet to try the pizza). 
The ribs come in a one-pound portion, with the option for two pounds. I know baby backs are often served as half- or full-racks. My estimation is that the one pound is more than a half rack.  I think I counted 8 bones. Meaty, juicy and flavorful, I was able to clean the meat from the ribs with just my fork. The entree comes with the choice of two sides, and I chose a dinner salad, nicely done, and an ample serving of sweet potato fries. I&#39;m a big guy, and a big eater, but I walked away from the single pound dinner fully satisfied."

There is a plethora of delicious items and options on their menu. The wings and nachos are a great option and will fill you up. Whether you&#39;re looking for a classic take on the American burger, smoked brisket tacos you&#39;re in luck. Also, if you&#39;re in the mood for just a tasty beverage this is the place. If you&#39;re looking or are in the mood for an amazing/classic variety selection of craft beer on tap and in bottles this is the place. There is a whole list of IPA&#39;s which I really appreciate as a craft beer lover and is a great addition for this town. Finally, I&#39;ve gotten the chance to visit the Range twice in the last couple of months  recently and I am very impressed. The whole dinning room and patio has a new and different feel to it and this place is here to stay. The owner personally comes up and greets the customers to make sure everyone is happy, so it is clear that good customer service is practiced here and the staff genuinely appreciates every customer that walks in. It was cool on both occasions to see how passionate the staff was about the Range and had different suggestions on what beers and food to order. Everyone had their favorite item on the menu!!!  Also, the owner has worked very hard and dedicated a lot of time and hours to  make sure that everyone working here is doing their best job possible, including removing one of the weekday daytime servers/bartenders who just wasn&#39;t performing and needed to leave. So all in all, I had a great experience and got great service each time, so...whether you plan to seek the next frequent after work drink and dinner or you go out occasionally like myself, put the Range on your list, as iti is now on the map in the great city of Batavia, the City of Energy."

The owner was always running around making sure everyone was having an enjoyable experience. I met several friends here Friday night for drinks and appetizers and it was horrendous. Two of us arrived and sat down at the table with one of our friends already sitting and drinking a beer. We sat and talked waiting for a waitress for 10 minutes to no avail.  Being thirsty at 7:30 on a Friday night I went to the bar to grab us a couple beers.  The first two drafts I order in told thy are out of with no replacement tapped.  Kind of odd. I ask what they have in bottles and the bartender ( who was a very nice woman) had no idea and said she doesn&#39;t know anything about beer. I finally look in the cooler myself and grab a couple beers.  I go back to the table to find the waitress now a good 20 minutes into our arrival still hasn&#39;t stopped by!  Fast forward 4 more friends arrive and sit and yep you guessed it had to go to the bar to grab beers after waiting 10 minutes.  Finally waitress comes over and we place food and at this point second drink orders.  It took her 20 minutes to bring back beers and she&#39;s brought back some attitude as well.  I was wondering where the hands on owner was and found out from another disgruntled patron that he was basically fired and bought out. Shame whoever is running it now has absolutely no clue what they are doing. I have to say quite possibly the worst service I&#39;ve ever had ever!

So my grade is incomplete, and based only on the beer menu (with an alluring dining tip from my neighbor).

Getting on to the beer then ~
The beer menu is above average, mixing a nice variety of microbrews with your every day redneck delights (MGD, Coors, Bud products).  Open Range was smart to add  these duds to the menu though, so they could please every type of beer drinker that walked through the door (even those without tastebuds).  Our server was extremely knowledgeable about every craft on their list, whether or not they had it in stock, what each beer was composed of and an honest opinion about each.  Given that their menu is around 75 beers deep, that&#39;s impressive.  The menu also shows the Style, ABV and BAS score for each beer.  That&#39;s a classy touch.  And lastly, the best part..their prices are decent, especially compared to many local spots vending microbrews.  Head over to Geneva and you&#39;ll definitely pay $1.50-$4 more per bottle.

My neighbors tip on the food was to try the prime rub, which he said was a mere $15 and phenomenal.  I also took a gander at the food menu and look forward to making a second trip with the fam.

Nice job Open Range.  This is a ten fold improvement over the dive that used to hold up the same roof.

Cheers."

But they do want to come to dinner with us, and suggested Open Range as nearby and suitably tasty.

This place is not super-obvious in downtown Batavia; the sign is kinda small and the street not terribly well-lit, plus there&#39;s roadwork right now. They have a small lot but there&#39;s a bigger one across the street. 

I didn&#39;t get a great grasp of the restaurant layout, but there were at least two rooms, one more &#34;dining&#34; and one with a bar. We were seated in the dining area at a longish table. 

The menu is slightly classed-up bar food -- burgers, sandwiches, pizzas, salads. They also have a pretty good craft beer list. I would say though that the layout of both is slightly confusing. The menu has one sandwich section with some burgers, and then another page with only burgers, with longer descriptions and pictures. The beer menu has one column with style/ABV/price and a second, mis-matched from the first, with the Beer Advocate rating. Weird.

That said, overall, both menus looked good once you could figure out how to read them.

Our orders were taken pretty promptly. I went for a Tumbleweed burger (bacon, queso, fried onion straws and a fried egg plus some kinda sauce), tempura zucchini as a side and an Ace Honey Cider to drink. I like that you have a variety of sides to choose from, and they&#39;re all the same price -- onion rings, zucchini, fries, salad, mashed potatoes and a few others. 

My burger was very good, and pretty messy. I ordered it medium but I think it was more like medium well. The egg yolk dripped all over as did the queso but it was a delicious mess. 

A few notes that keep it from being five stars for me:

-- No glasses were offered for bottled beer. Every beer snob knows you need a glass to really experience the full flavor of your beverage.

-- Water refills were sporadic.

-- Waitress did a great job with separate checks, but then there was some sort of weird thing with mine, she claimed she had run the wrong bill on my card, but I immediately looked at my credit card app, and there was the original charge, a refund for it, and then the same exact charge (which was correct, based on my math) ... it was strange. 

The atmosphere was sort of odd, too, they clearly are going for a little bit nicer food menu but it reads like a bar through and through. 

Still, I would definitely come back for the creative food menu and good beer list."

Not much of a crowd on a snowy Sunday evening, but the bar is inviting and the staff are super attentive and friendly...

Will be back with a few mates next time - hopefully there will be a better atmosphere with a few more punters..."

Okay I&#39;ll extend that to the western suburbs, because there&#39;s no way I&#39;m going anywhere else with these so close. I usually go in wanting to try something new, but land on a burger because they&#39;re just that good. Honkey Tonk is delicious, but I had to break up with it when I met the Range Burger. Something about the chipotle mayo that goes on the top. Speaking of, the brisket poppers are the best! Always cooked well, crispy on the outside with a nice melty cheesy center with brisket inside, promptly dunked in chipotle sauce and shoveled into your mouth. Fiance and I can&#39;t go and not split an order. We&#39;ve tried. It doesn&#39;t work. Great beer selection, the owner Jeremy really knows his stuff in this area. Pizza is also a good option, though we tend to order it well done because they come out just a pinch under what we&#39;d prefer sometimes. Overall, we keep going back. Especially in the summer, the big screened in porch is absolute heaven with a beer in your hand."

Our table ordered 3 burgers, 1 pulled pork sandwich and a tenderloin sandwich.  My pulled pork was ok; it tasted good, but it was barely lukewarm, as were the sweet potato fries.  Others seemed to have similar complaints about the temperature of their burgers, as well as that their burgers were dry.  My husband&#39;s burger was missing the bacon advertised.  The tenderloin sandwich appeared to be made with skirt steak instead of the tenderloin as advertised.  

I will say, our waitress was friendly but not too attentive; I don&#39;t recall being asked how our meal was at all, and our drinks weren&#39;t refilled like they tend to be at other places.  I would like to give this place another try; I&#39;m really hoping they simply had an off night...."

We would recommend nachos without the cheese sauce (leaving just shredded cheese). 

My wife&#39;s fajitas were good but overlooked. My pulled pork sandwich was more like chopped pork (which was ok). Onion straws are really good. 

Not a place to crave but it does the trick. 

One note... This is somehow related to Open Range in Sugar Grove. The food is very close to the same, but we have been to Open Range many times and the food was always better than what we experienced here. We would drive a little further to go to Open Range in the future."

However, twice now I have tried the brisket and twice I have been disappointed. This time around I had the brisket tacos. Both the tortillas and brisket were dry and just not tasty. Even the sauce it comes with couldn&#39;t save it. 

We also tried the pretzel nuggets appetizer. The nuggets were pretty good, although a few were dry and doughy. The disappointment here was with the beer cheese sauce it came with, which was just nasty. It was almost rancid tasting. I&#39;m not sure who would enjoy such a sauce. I love beer, and I love cheese, but that combo was not good at all. Thankfully our server was able to bring us a queso cheese instead, which, although it was runny, was a vast improvement.

Others at the table had ribs, which I sampled and enjoyed. The sauce had a nice smokey sweetness. The pizza was also good, not great.

What might get me to come back is the huge beer menu, which is extensive and eclectic. Our server Tyler was attentive and friendly."

The food is great, the prices are good, the beer selection is good...great place to bring the family, watch a game, drink some beers, and mingle with the staff (because they are really nice!). It&#39;s located in downtown Batavia, so you can enjoy a nice stroll before or after your meal. You might need a stroll or two or ten after eating some of their delicious, hearty food.

I&#39;ll admit...the service when we went was a bit slow. But we were in a group of about 12, so its to be somewhat expected. There was a half-off pizza deal going on, but apparently they ran out of pizza dough, so we couldn&#39;t order that anymore. It happens, right? Well they felt bad for the people wanting to order pizza and still took part of the check off anyway. That was super of them! 

The brisket I ordered was fab. You got a good amount of it and it was charred just enough. I ordered it with grilled veggies and roasted corn/queso. The grilled veggies were a little cold, but seasoned well enough to make it forgivable. Corn and queso, DEFINITELY good.

Let&#39;s take a step back for a second and talk about this menu. If you go to their website, you can look up what you are ordering and see a REAL picture of what you want. It&#39;s all mouthwatering and doesn&#39;t look like fake staged fast food pictures. The nachos picture has those imperfections that nachos tend to have...cheese falling off the plate, olives not evenly distributed, an interesting shape of sour cream...this is real life nachos, and they look heavenly. But then continue to scroll down, and you can see the best-looking burgers and sandwiches this side of the Rio Grande. 
The Honky Tonk Burger, with an egg, queso, and onion straws. 
The Kansas City Burger, with pulled pork, onion straws, coleslaw, and cheese. 
The Beef Brisket and Famous Pulled Pork Sandwiches, all piled high with their slow-cooked meats.
COME.ON. HOW AM I NOT SUPPOSED TO WANT EVERYTHING?
It doesn&#39;t even end there. Take a look at their enormous, cheesy Range Burrito. It comes in a skillet because it can&#39;t contain all the flavors literally falling out of it. Or the Smoked Brisket Tacos...this has gotta be the best picture on the website. 
Top it all off? Bacon Maple Donut Holes. I&#39;m done. Peace out. I can&#39;t handle this menu anymore. I&#39;m fatter just by reading it. It all sounds delicious.

Do you want to go there yet? No? Are you dead? Is your heart even beating? Because this place looks and sounds delicious, all things considered...and you should consider your life choices if you aren&#39;t making immediate plans to go there and try something with queso sauce on it (because more than half the menu comes with queso)."

The residents of Batavia want so badly to support local buisiness. &#34;Give us good food at a fair price&#34;. This place is on targer to do just that!  

Sooo many local restaurants over the years have failed to figure this out, particularly in the building currently occupied by open range....hopefully the pattern is broken.

As I said, good food with an interesting menu offering &#34;just enough&#34; options to choose from. All said, just the opposite, as the beer menu offers extensive options to meet your needs....PBR&#39;s to Micro Brews. Well done!

I saved the best for last! The bar area also has several tables to dine as well. This area supports a glass partition between the bar and dining area. This is great. You have an open view of the entire restaurant and a sound barrier from youngster roguish rascals &#34;doin&#39; their thing&#34;.

You think you are getting a normal priced pizza because the fine print at the top of the page and not by the acc pizza I ordered had an up garage. They messed up the order for my pizza and the server said &#34;since Monday is normally buy one get one free pizza night you can give it to you today even tho it&#39;s Sunday&#34;. He tried to make me feel like that I was lucky to get the pizza I acc ordered. 

I ordered w beer on tap. I thought it looked flat no head or anything. I tasted it and it was flat. I told the bartender and he said ohh it must be empty then I had to ask for a diff beer. 

I found a misprint on the beer list/menu. I thought the beer I ordered was $4.50 that&#39;s what it said on the beer list then I saw on the menu it said $5.50. I asked the bartender what the price was. He said let me check went to the manager or owner then he came back and said its been debunked. And the beer list price is the old price when it was in cans and the menu price is now that it&#39;s on tap. They didn&#39;t give it to me for the price I thought I was paying somehow they charged me $5.15 a beer?! So confusing, I just paid it. 

All in all a good local bar but make sure you read the menu carefully and maybe even be prepared to pay more. 

Also why no deals on Sundays for football?"

Open Range is a place you should bring friends/family who are into drinking, eating, socializing.

#1  EIGHTY-SEVEN beers under $4.25

#2 Texas Beef Brisket

#3 Crab Cakes"

Is very convenient and I like to support our local businesses.   They&#39;d been posting photos on their website and the food looked amazing.  

I went with my husband and son on a Friday evening.  We were seated right away.  From there it took 10 minutes to get a server and another 20 for our beers.  I was worried but from that point on the service was excellent. In all fairness, there was a very large party that appeared to have been seated not long before us. 

We went in on a Friday specifically for the fish fry. My husband ordered the fried fish which came with waffle fries, green beans and his choice of soup or salad.  He had the chicken tortilla soup which I tried.  It was a creamy base and was quite good.  My son ordered the kids cheese pizza.  He ate nearly all of it and enjoyed it.  I ordered the crab cakes.  The three nice sized crab cakes came with really yummy garlic Parmesan mashed potatoes and incredible tempura zucchini.   The cab cakes were so big I ended up bringing home some of my dinner.  

The owner comped us dessert that visit. We had the beignets with vanilla ice cream and raspberry sauce.  I am not big on dessert unless its out of the ordinary.  This was amazing.  Get the beignets if you come here. 

The beer selection is crazy big.  They had a favorite IPA of mine that&#39;s not easy to find so I was happy.  

I cannot wait to visit again soon!"

If you can get past the outside looking like a shanty, the wood paneling on the walls, and the decade old carpet...this place is a great hidden gem. 
Last night I ventured there for a quick meal and a microbrew. I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised by how courteous the staff was, the waitress more attentive to our needs than many high scale restraints I frequent. 
The beer selection is astounding to say the least. There also is a wine selection,but I highly recommend a micro brew, even for the palate of the most sophisticated wine snob.
Pretzels and cheese was mediocre, I actually would not order again. The pretzels were hard and the cheese dip thin and over spicy.
I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and it was mouth watering. The right combination of pork and BBQ sauce on a crusty roll. I would have liked more slaw on the sandwich along with a few more crunchy onion straws, but this is definitely worth ordering again.
The burgers were very appealing and large! 
The bar is nicely sanctioned off and not overly loud, even on a Saturday night.
Good work Open Range. I will be back!"

Nothing fancy, just somewhere with good food where we could still enjoy the beautiful weather. This place is perfect for that! The food was great, the staff was very friendly and attentive and the atmosphere is laid back and welcoming. It was the perfect day to sit out on the covered patio. 
I loved the tempura battered zucchini. I also ordered a steak sandwich with garlic aioli on a ciabatta roll that was delicious. The chocolate filled binets for dessert were amazing! I think I may have found a new favorite restaurant in this area. We&#39;ll definitely be back!"

We rode our bikes to Open Range thinking that we would get a burger and a beer.  What I didn&#39;t expect was a huge microbrew selection (like the Ale House in Geneva) at incredibly reasonable prices.  I had a Dogfish Head 60 min IPA for $4.50.  My wife had a Matilda for $5.50.  If you&#39;re a beer drinker, you know that those prices are near some places&#39; bud light drafts.  It was awesome to have such an extensive beer selection at affordable prices!  

The food was very good.  I had a pulled pork.  Wife had the brisquet.  Very good.  And, the burger choices, which we do didn&#39;t try looked great.

Finally, the service was very good.  The waitress let my wife try a sampler of the Burbon Ale (which she found out wasn&#39;t for her).  I&#39;ll contrast this with an experience I had at the Ale House in Geneva where we paid for a three glass sampler, and my wife just hated one of the beers.  When we asked, the waitress said that she could not replace the sampler and we&#39;d have to pay 1/3 of the sampler price to get a new one. Since we were very loyal customers at the Ale House and have spent hundreds there, this was off-putting.  Whatever.  the Open Range server we had was friendly, prompt, and accommodating!"

I accidentally came on a trivia night, so the only place for me was at the bar. The servers were friendly and prompt. I ordered a  Southwest Salad, and was delightfully impressed at how the flavors worked together. The steak in the salad was nice, and tender.

We decided to give the place a shot after seeing some positive reviews.  My friend and co-conspirator also thought it would be a nice salad/pizza/wine/dessert night.  The server was attentive, and didn&#39;t mind when we retreated from the dining room to the more adult environment of a bar side hi top after a large group with many youngsters tumbled in.

Side salads were nice - fresh spring greens and generously portioned.  Wine list was adequate for the venue and reasonably priced.

But - the pizza.  

A nice layer of decent cheese, good Italian sausage, a slightly too-sweet-for-me sauce atop a burnt crust that I strongly suspect is a shipped-in item.  Not too burnt to be inedible...but right on the cusp.  (And we were, quite frankly - way too hungry to wait for a do-over.)  I mentioned the crust to the server, and the manager on duty stopped over at our table.  Really nice guy - and he comped our dessert for the pizza fail.

But - the dessert.

A lovely portion of beignets, big enough to share, drizzled with chocolate syrup, (per our request), with a nice scoop of vanilla ice cream in the center.  Pretty to look at, and - upon first taste - rich and delicious.  Only...they&#39;re supposed to be cooked all the way through.  The centers were raw dough.  Once again, we finished without requesting a redo.  A little bit of raw dough won&#39;t kill me, (so far). 

Maybe we&#39;ll try them again some other time.

And - then again - maybe not.

I&#39;m somewhere between overcooked and underdone with my decision."

Walking, especially in summer is just very nice. However, we made an exception last night and broadened our horizons all the way to Batavia for my birthday.
Once I went to the correct side of the river (for reference, it&#39;s the west side) we parked right in front.  I imagine if they are super busy, you would park across the street in the public lot as there were only 4-5 spaces right in front. 
Upon walking up, I was impressed with the outdoor seating area.  Finally someone with a place near the river has figured out to but up screening to keep the river monsters, I mean gnats, out of your food.  Score 1 for Open Range.  
We were seated by the host who also ended up being our server.  Nice guy, quick with suggestions and to bring an emergency plate of chips and guacamole to our &#34;starving&#34; 12 year old.  
Bonus for Wednesdays:  1/2 price apps, deserts and BOTTLES OF WINE.  Wines are mostly ones we&#39;ve heard of so we went with the Mark West Pinot.  
We ordered the filet sliders for the girls and crab cakes for us for apps.  Both were fantastic.  I was especially happy that one girl was sick and didn&#39;t want to eat so I got some slider too.  Very tender filet style sliders with onion strings.  Yum.
The crab cakes were good too, although I&#39;m spoiled having lived with Maryland crab cakes for years.
The one girl sick precipitated us getting our orders to go.  One kid did a cheese pizza, wifey did the mahi mahi fish tacos with grilled veggies and I went full carnivore on the brisket with the rize and queso side.  
All were very good. My brisket was melt in the mouth with a little bit of smokiness.  Fish tacos were firm but tender (I think that&#39;s possible) and the cheese pizza was flavorful (disclaimer: I ate it for breakfast this morning, but it was still good).
Let me get to the best part:  the beer list.  I can&#39;t remember the name, but I had a Kentucky Bourbon based draft and it was one of my favorite beers ever.  So good.  Bonus for being 8.1% ABV too.  They had a bunch of craft beers on the menu, I think the server said 70+.  Mama&#39;s Little Yellow Pils and Dale&#39;s Pale Ale being two of my go-tos were prominently featured.
Finally, we did desert as it was my birthday.  How about bacon filled donuts with powdered sugar and maple syrup for dipping?  2 please.  Decadent yes.
Overall we enjoyed it.  Decor was kind of northwoods lodge meets a bit more upscale bistro.  Pleasant enough.  
Thanks for a great birthday meal!"

I asked for lemonade and she says &#34;lemonade, sure?&#34; Yes, sure. OMG. She wasn&#39;t busy as she wandered slowly or peered around the kitchen wall at us. I was dumbfounded by our service. 

The food was just OK. Our sawmill gravy was cold and gloppy. The apple butter was so cold that it chilled any biscuit or muffin we put it on. And the cheesy hash browns were so dry that we didn&#39;t eat them.

The biscuits were just little pieces of heaven nice and buttery and soft.  

I did over indulge and had some of my friends pancakes and those were delicious as well.. Just writing this review has made me hungry and thinking of going soon!! 

The waiter wasn&#39;t bad but didn&#39;t go above and beyond he made sure our food was there and water was in our glass, would&#39;ve liked if he was more friednly but maybe he was having an off day nontheless we had everything we needed or asked for."

I have been going here (not to this location in particular) since I was a kid and I absolutely love the store and all the candy and fun little toys they have like the choo-choo train whistle and the lightening bug house! Cracker Barrel for me is just a really nostalgic place and I thoroughly enjoy eating and shopping here with family and friends. 

This specific location is decent. The food is sometimes a hit and sometimes a miss in that you may go at a time where everything was just made fresh, or may get a side of cheesy hashbrown casserole or mac and cheese that has been sitting out awhile and is completely dried out. That&#39;s happened to me a few times at this location.

The service is also pretty wishy washy. Sometimes I&#39;ve had really great servers that are the sweetest people I&#39;ve ever met and other times and I&#39;ve had servers with no personality or customer service skills whatsoever. 

But...the prices are great, the menu items are delicious, and the store is awesome. My favorite is the country vegetable plate! You can get four sides so I normally get the mashed potatoes and gravy, mac and cheese, cheesy hashbrown casserole, and cinnamon apples. Talk about a carb overload!"

It is OKAY at best, but no different in many ways than what you can get at Denny&#39;s, Red Apple, IHOP, or any other run of the mill Greek type family restaurant.  Picture any of those places with a little southern store and &#34;southern atmosphere&#34; - that&#39;s Cracker Barrel.

Nothing I would go out of my way for.  This restaurant probably does well because it is situated right next to a hotel (as many of them seem to be) - I&#39;m sure more than a few people from out of state (or out of the area) don&#39;t want to drive far looking for a meal during their stay, and there is a huge convenience factor here in that you only need to walk a few hundred feet w/ the kids to a restaurant.  Simple enough.

The few times I have been here the food has been &#39;okay&#39;, but as I said - this is nothing I would come out of my way for.  Kinda overrated if you ask me.

First off, I love how they have an old country store inside. The candy, clothes, and other crap (it&#39;s not crap per se, I should say things) make it so unique. I also like how the different areas have local items i.e. near the Ohio/Kentucky border, a CB i went to had plenty of UK items. I also love how you can take home some of the items from their kitchen.

Onto the service of this particular location, I thought it was great! We had a pretty large party, and we arrived around 9 am. We were seated promptly, and we ordered and were done eating by 930ish. The coffee and drinks were flowing, and the food was fresh and hot.

My complaint comes with the actual menu. I wanted to ordered the eggs and meat platter, but i wanted a porkchop instead of bacon or sausage. NO SUBSTITUTIONS. All restaurants usually do substituions, even with an upcharge, but not CB. Defintely a complaint of mine. Also, why does CB not do omelettes!!??!?! It drives me nuts (YAR)! I feel like getting 3 eggs is not enough, but if I got a three egg omelette, I would be much more satisfied. I ended up with three eggs, a porkchop, toast, and fruit. I also had 2 of my mom&#39;s scrambled eggs, but i wasn&#39;t overly stuffed. I have quite a hearty appetite, so no big deal.

That being said, I had, and have had a few experiences here, and none have been bad, Unfortunately, I&#39;m not a fan of the breakfast menu. I&#39;m a much bigger fan of their lunch and dinner menu!! I recommend CB over any other chain on the road (waffle house, Dennys etc.).

Make sure you get there before 10 on the weekends.... it was packed when we left!"

One grandson had biscuits and gravy but the gravy was so thick I had to scoop it out of the bowl with a spoon and there was no sausage in it? Probably the way they make it, but it was tasty.

Atmosphere:
I give props to this place for going all out on the Old Country theme. In the summer they have these awesome rocking chairs with Chess/Checkers outside the store front. The Store that you go through before you head to the dining area is full of many fun souvenirs and knick knack. I do have to dock points though for having dirty silverware. I gave up on asking for a 3rd set and just cleaned it myself with water.

Service:
A Ok. Food came out pretty fast. Our waiter must have had a long day as he seemed burnt out.

Food:
One thing about this place always does right is the Country portions. You will get stuffed if you order an Entree with sides. You get three sides and a corn bread/biscuit per entree! I absolutely love their creamy Mac N Cheese! The cheese tastes like it came from Wisconsin and my Baked Sweet Potato wasn&#39;t too shabby. A little soggy but still good. My main entree was Chicken and Dumplings. I was a tad disappointed with how bland it was, but that is the risk with new menu items. It felt like it was left in a pot all day. I have never really been disappointed with their burgers or steaks though. The consistency is there, but some entrees obviously outshine the rest.

I would go here again. The Old Country must have been the life with how much food they ate. The most &#34;authentic&#34; Country style place I have ever been to."

Maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;m from the South, I don&#39;t know.  When I lived in Los Angeles, I once seriously contemplated a trip to the nearest location hundreds and hundreds of miles away in Arizona so my then boyfriend now husband could experience the wonder.

Now that we live in Chicago and there&#39;s this one in Aurora, we can go whenever we want!

I can honestly say that their dumplings (I can&#39;t say &#34;dumplins&#34; I just can&#39;t) and gravy might be the ONLY food that makes me kind of miss eating products made with animal broth or fat or what have you.  I&#39;m vegetarian, not vegan, but I won&#39;t eat anything meat broth or meat fat etc.  

The two of us can absolutely pig out and stuff ourselves here for like $20!  We&#39;re always shocked at how cheap our check is considering all the food we eat.

Most of the time, I just order a salad with the egg sandwich on sourdough bread (hold the tomato and mayonnaise thankyouverymuch) and sometimes I&#39;ll get apple butter (mmmmm) and biscuits.  LOVE apple butter...  And usually some sides.  Love their fried apples.  

My husband can pretty much order whatever the hell he wants, something he takes full advantage of.  He&#39;s had just about everything on the menu, be it breakfast or lunch.  He typically orders two breakfast entrees.  For someone as emaciated as he is, you&#39;d never guess he eats enough for a famly of four, but he does.  

We love looking around the store.  I&#39;m a sucker for retro/vintage candy and I&#39;ve actually found a couple of cool shirts on their clothing clearance rack.  We&#39;re not into &#34;country&#34; or &#34;Jesus&#34; stuff but we&#39;ve found some pretty cool tchotchkes here, mostly Halloween decor.  I got an adorable little resin statue of a dog that looks like ours dressed as Frankenstein.  It was like 50% off.  Awesome.  

One thing I can&#39;t bring myself to do anymore is play the golf tee game.  All I can think of is how germy they are..."

They way you can shop before you eat is ingenious and almost all the time I am buying nostalgic candy just because it takes me to a time when things were done so inexpensively. Except the prices don&#39;t reflect what was back then. 

I had the Chicken which already had dumplings in it. . And as a side i also ordered dumplings, but I really do think that the waitress should of said &#34;Oh you already have dumplings&#34;, than I wouldn&#39;t have ordered another round. 

Their raspberry sweet iced tea was yuchhh. I really never send things back but this time I said, &#34;No, I wanted sweet and it isn&#39;t&#34;. So I sent it back and that was that. 

The raspberry iced lemonade was really nice though, and the waitress didn&#39;t charge me extra for it. 

I think that Cracker Barrel is an experience that most need to try once in a while. Its worth the trip for the Chicagoans but well worth it in the end, good conversation and great food, what more can you ask for."

CRISPY PANCAKES.

I went to a Cracker Barrel in another state and they gave me crispy pancakes and I thought, wow, that&#39;s awesome. So, I came to this particular place and asked for them to be crispy and they did it just as awesome. I never liked pancakes before because I wasn&#39;t fond of the fluffy cake-like sugary stuff in the morning. But after Cracker Barrel introduced me to crispy pancakes, I have fallen in love. They&#39;re crispy and chewy and makes a WHOLE lot of difference. 

Chicken and dumplin&#39;s? I love it. Their fried catfish? Love that too. I&#39;m so glad I live far from this place because I would be such a fatty if I ate here everyday. 

So, just remember, if you order pancakes, make sure to tell your server to make them crispy. I don&#39;t know if people normally order them crispy or not and I just sound like a crazy fool who just found out what a light bulb does, but order them crispy. That is all. I love you cracker barrel."

It&#39;s always swamped with people. The store (great as always) is always filled with people waiting to be seated to eat. If you are ok with being shoulder to shoulder with people for 15-20 minutes, then by all means, this place is for you.

Don&#39;t get me wrong though...my husband and I are obsessed with Cracker Barrel. Their fried catfish is pretty good for chain catfish. The cheesy hashbrown casserole is sinfully delicious. And oh my goodness, the CHICKEN &#39;N&#39; DUMPLINS are my jam.

You can get a hearty, stick to your ribs kinda meal for $10. You&#39;ll never regret it...unless you go for Sunday brunch. Then you&#39;ll ask yourself &#34;Why did I wait forever for this?&#34; But even then it&#39;s questionable."

Usually I have no problem eating at Cracker Barrel. The food is good and hearty. Their breakfast items can&#39;t be beat. So coming here on a Saturday night was a pretty good choice. Or so I thought.

We&#39;re seated and immediately the waitress takes our drink order. A few minutes later, she arrives with drinks and stands impatiently wanting to take our order even though it&#39;s clear we needed more time. Running out of time, I go with the old standby of meatloaf, mashed potatoes, green beans and carrots. 

Within five minutes, the meal arrives. Even for Cracker Barrel quality, it looked poor. I tried the meatloaf and it tasted as if it sat in a pan all night. The carrots were waterlogged and the beans were bland. Where was my delicious meatloaf dinner? This was no better than low end cafeteria slop. To make matters worse, the water off one of the veggies ran into the potatoes turning them into basically runny mush. It was so unappealing.

Even worse was the service. The one thing that annoys me more than anything else... dropping off the check before I even started to eat. I&#39;ve never felt so rushed in my life. The waitress hovered all night. As soon as the last bite of food was in your mouth, she was already clearing the table. I want to have a nice dinner and relax, not have someone pawing at your plates all night. From the time we ordered to the time we left was around 35 minutes on an uncrowded Saturday night.

This experience so soured me, I doubt I will ever go back even for breakfast. When I pay for dinner I want quality and service, not be rushed like I&#39;m in the chow line at the army with food that is just as bad."

Nothing is better than country gravy in my opinion.
well in moderation nothing is like it. it&#39;s really heavy/hearty food but really great and not expensive for the amount of food.

the wait wasn&#39;t too long for a sunday at 12:30 (about 15min), it was really crowded but we got a nice 4top table for two people so we had space. service was fast and our waitress was on top of refills without us having to ask for them."

My boyfriend and I arrived a little after six, were promptly seated, and our order was taken by our waitress who seemed competent enough.  And that&#39;s when things started going downhill.  We waited and waited for our food, watched several tables around us order their food, eat, and leave...and our food still wasn&#39;t coming.  Our waitress apparently disappeared.  After almost an hour, she reappeared and stated that our order was &#34;bumped&#34;, as she called it, which means they basically lost our order.  So we ordered again, and my boyfriend decided to change his choice from beef to ham, which we were told would not be an issue.  We waited about another twenty minutes, and the waitress quickly placed our food on the table and ran off.  My boyfriend then noticed that his food was completely cold.  Not even a little steam, a little warm ham juice, nothing...just a cold slab of ham.  So we waited some more to see if our waitress would come back to check if everything was ok, but she was nowhere in sight.  My boyfriend asked another waitress to please get the manager.  The manager came shortly thereafter, but didn&#39;t introduce himself (so I don&#39;t know his name) or look at all like he cared about anything other than his headset.  He seemed distracted and didn&#39;t even pretend to care about my boyfriend&#39;s explanation of our problem.  He didn&#39;t even apologize, but just said that he would give my boyfriend a warm piece of ham and added that the food was cold because my boyfriend had changed his order.  How does that even make sense?!?  He brought the ham once again without a hint of apology and left.  Then our waitress showed up and said that because of all the mix-ups, we could get a free dessert.  Well, we thought, that&#39;s not much, but at least it&#39;s a token acknowledgement that maybe an hour and a half is not standard waiting time for what is essentially a precooked meal that they just put on a plate.   We picked a berry cobbler as our dessert.  Now normally the cobbler comes in a sizable dish and is enough to feed about three or maybe even four people...what did we get? A tiny half filled solo cup with some berries on the bottom and a small piece of crust on top that looked like it had been scraped off from someone&#39;s unfinished plate.  At that point we just paid our bill and left.  The moral of this story?  Cracker Barrel is usually a good restaurant, but I would STRONGLY caution against coming to this location.  The service is horrible, the manager just completely doesn&#39;t care about the customers and even tried to blame us for what was the restaurant&#39;s fault.  The food is cheap, but it just isn&#39;t worth the hassle."

While I did enjoy the yorgert parfet here I couldn&#39;t believe how small it was. Portion size isn&#39;t a strong point here.  I also ordered the Sour Dough toast which was also good but geeze can they spare it. We are talking two small pieces here. The service at this location however was good. Our waitress was good with refills. The store sells mostly junk except a few old time candies that you can get cheaper elsewhere. All and all nothing to see here though.

They have breakfast all day long, and they&#39;ve got anything you could want.

Try one with the green beans, hashbrown casserole, fried apples, or mashed potatoes.  You can&#39;t go wrong!  And, of course, this is all served with biscuits or cornbread.

There&#39;s also the added bonus of coming on a colder day; you might just get to sit next to a cozy, yummy smelling fire.

Also the wait would be unbearable if you&#39;re actually hungry.

Better try weekdays or Saturdays. However, I&#39;ve almost felt the wait times slip on by when browsing the interesting store section which encompasses a variety of olde time sweets and snackables as well as items for the home and kitchen. The garden accessories arefun to browse through in the summer months, and they features sidewalk/white elephant sales periodically. The seasonal merchandise is a lot of fun in a corny/cutesy kind of way. They carry Coca-Cola and John Deere souvenirs, and they used to carry fiestaware products up until about two years ago (if you ask me they should definitely bring em back). Don&#39;t forget to peruse the books on CD that you can buy and return to any of their stores to swap at a discount for another book on CD... kind of useful for someone who&#39;s on the road a lot like some family summer vacationers and/or truckers. And they carry some unique CD series from the Opry as well as for some of today&#39;s and yesteryear&#39;s favorite country or folk crooners.

The menu is down country homey and delicious, the best part is that any store you visit the food is the same exact way, but never tastes prefabricated or off in any way. The Coca-Cola chocolate cake and the frozen mug sundaes (try caramel or hot fudge) are a must try, as well as any of their daily or seasonal menu specials. The pork and beef plates are fork tender and savory!

They&#39;re also famous for serving breakfast all day long, which includes their delectable, if a little salty, biscuits and sawmill gravy... mmm! Don&#39;t forget the humongous pancackes, but please don&#39;t be a slob and order them with sweet fruit topping AND whipped cream... just asking for a coronary.

They offer some sort of takeout as I&#39;ve seen off-season and during various holidays such as Xmas and Thanksgiving."

It&#39;s a dive that is more like a truck stop off of Route 30 than a proper restaurant.  But the tables were clean, and it&#39;ll do in the wasteland that is Plainfield and it&#39;s perilous lack of good Mexican restaurants.

The Horchata is the best.  Just perfect on the cinnamon and not too watery.

Chiles Rellenos were good, but slightly overcooked.  That&#39;s okay though, because I don&#39;t like eggy batter.  

Chips and salsa are OK.  Elotes are not good, as the dish we were served was very watery.  It was all corn and melted butter with very little mayo, cheese, and chili powder.

It was just us and another table occupying the place.  It could have been an off night, but I have never seen many cars in the parking lot.  

The service was fine.  The girl working here was neither rude nor overly friendly, but I think there was a slight language barrier anyway since our orders were slightly messed up.  I said &#34;no beans,&#34; but I got beans.  His meal was supposed to come with beans &amp; rice, but there were none.

Nothing really stood out to me.  My food was OK overall, but very good considering the area and other options available.  I think Taco Diner in Bolingbrook will continue to be our go-to spot for Mexican grub."

Fast service, decent prices, portions are big, food is delicious, friendly employees, yummy home made salsas and chips.  I&#39;ve found myself eating here a few times a month.

- A bit of a dive.  Not dirty, but definitely not fancy.
- WAY above average food for very reasonable prices
- I think its a little bit better than Taco Diner in Bolingbrook and considerably better than Burrito Parrilla in south Naperville.  Burrito is good, but really bland in comparison.
- Service is good, if not exceptionally friendly.  The counter girl / worker is more stoic than rude.
- This is my go-to Mexican food place.  If it was busier, I&#39;d keep it a secret because its small.  But I want it to succeed, so please check it out!"

Let&#39;s face it, Plainfield is not much for authentic Mexican food but this place was awful. 
I&#39;ll start from the beginning, placed my order over phone, went over the entire order twice. Order was almost $30 for a chicken burrito, 4 tacos, chips and salsa and small order of guacamole. Which to me is a bit high for a dive. 
Came back and order was wrong. No chips and salsa and entire order of Guac just useless. All the tacos were missing items. 
I called back because fortunately I am able to afford $30 for garbage food but to some people they work hard and it&#39;s unfortunate to be taken advantage who work hard for their money. 
Now the quality of food:
Guacamole- not that I would probably ate much of it because it was not fresh and mushy and seemed watered down. 
Burrito - was small and could have used more meat.
Tacos-were all wrong but we&#39;re talking quality food soo steak tacos were flavorless and probably lowest grade in steak.
The pork would have been good if it was the way I paid for it to be made. 
Sauces- only thing that made these tacos &#34;good&#34; 

If you would like some suggestions for tacos in this area I would be more than happy to share. Save your money"

I must say they were good, I wish the pastor could have been a little more &#34;burnt&#34; for my taste but the flavor was there, the steak was on par and both topped with cebolla and cilantro with regular size double tortillas.

Nosh is definitely no secret, but it is slightly hidden on James Street, set back slightly farther than other store fronts.

The food and drinks are good.  I had the Monte Cristo Benedict, with a grape hollandaise sauce.  There are some solid breakfast staples on the menu as well as some inventive dishes - they&#39;ve really got the hollandaise thing down.  The eggs on my benedict were cooked perfectly, which is crucial to a good benedict!  The benedict came with a side of my choice - the potatoes were okay, just potatoes really, next time I&#39;ll try the ginger pears.  The food prices and portions are perfect.  Most entrees are in the $10-12 range.

The drinks are made well and decently sized and priced.  For $8, I had a really good raspberry pear mimosa.

The interior is a little blah and lacks some comfort at the tables in the center of the restaurant.  The service was good, but I felt a little rushed at the end of our meal, but I could have stayed for another drink to catch up with a friend.

Nosh has good food and drinks and is worth a short drive, but it is not a spot to linger."

Smallish and gratefully off the overworn Geneva shopping path, a major step above your usual independent diner variety, quality ingredients, furnishings and help. 
One of us, not me, was disappointed to find that the biscuits and gravy are only available on the weekends. My older brother had one of the best blueberry pancake plates he said he had ever had, and he knows blueberry pancakes. I went with the Chilaquiles plate because Renee said it was spicy, and it was a little spicy.  I had avocado added, but what it really needed was something to make it really a mess like tomatoes and more cheese. Picture good house made nachos in a thicker sea of chicken broth with a couple eggs over easy on top and some grated cheese, mushy, kind of a deconstructed egg nacho frittata without the shrooms, tomatoes and spinach.  Needed some texture and color, but I still liked it and appreciated the recommendation because it was different. I&#39;ll order it again in about 40 years if I don&#39;t have my teeth. You can also add other meats. I should have added the chorizo, didn&#39;t spot it until later, not my best ordering. By the way, adding all that almost doubles the price. Fairly priced for the level of quality and service.

Better than average coffee in nice LARGE mugs thank you. Not much sound absorption in there so it&#39;s LOUDer than it needs to be. Anything on the polished concrete floors and largely bare ceilings/wall coverings would help. Maybe a little dark but I prefer that over the too bright too early breakfast look. Nice booth or window options, very comfortable.

Served very ably by Renee and helpers. We&#39;ll be back."

The patio is great for a beautiful summer morning. Our server was pleasant and got me a coffee to go. The coffe is solid!

The food was the downfall of the trip. I&#39;m not sure if we ordered the &#34;wrong&#34; food, but it was not very good. I ordered the Sedona omelette with pulled pork/cheese/ham. It arrived (almost too quickly) in one of those pre made egg shells. The pulled pork lacked flavor and the omelette was soggy. The potatoes were also not very crisp. The toast was good! (That&#39;s sad)

My husband ordered eggs, bacon, and steak. Steak came in those strips like you get out of the bag. And the bacon was I Hop quality. He said the eggs were good. Once again, kinda sad.

I assumed it would be for brunch, but when Olivia B and I planned to meet for lunch in the area I thought -- hey, nows a good a time as any!

The restaurant was busy at 12:30 pm on a Friday, but we were still able to get a table right away. Our waitress was nice, checked in on us often, and asked before clearing our plates. Per usual, I had a bit of a tug of war between all the breakfast and lunch options. I mean really, how do you choose? I decided since I actually ate a decent breakfast that day, I would opt for the lunch side of the menu.

I&#39;ve been on a salad kick lately, so I went with the grilled steak salad. This leafy lunch includes grilled flat iron steak, mixed greens, tomato, red onion, and crumbled blue cheese with sweet mustard vinaigrette. Once I heard Olivia was adding avocado to her meal, I couldn&#39;t help but agree that it would be a great addition to my salad. Highly suggest doing this! The salad was tasty regardless, but the avocado paired nicely (like it usually does with most everything).

Being a Friday, we decided to indulge in a mimosa at lunch. I love that they have a fun mimosa list of flavors and other cocktails. Always nice to have options! That being said, I was feeling OJ so I stuck with a classic mimosa. And let me tell you, these bubbly cocktails aren&#39;t messing around! Forget the dainty little flute you&#39;re used to, this pint-like glass is full to the brim and not shy with the champs either!

Great atmosphere, intriguing menu, and decent prices -- I&#39;ll definitely be back to sit on their patio and dive into brunch."

Being a Friday, I quickly made two excellent decisions 1 - I indulged in breakfast at 12:30 because why not? and 2 - we both chose to enjoy mimosas with our meals! 

They have a whole menu of mimosas and I believe I had something along the lines of mango pomegranate. It was SO tasty and believe me you it was quite a large glass not a dainty little thing. I loved my choice.

My food...was alright. I didn&#39;t particularly love the tri-colored benedict I ordered. Why, you may ask? Well, despite it&#39;s name, everything on my plate was so...beige. Really. Check out the pic attached. I&#39;m not even making up the name TRI-COLORED BENEDICT. Once I did a little digging I did find two teeny shriveled up (oven roasted) tomato pieces between the english muffin and poached eggs but the dish left a lot to be desired. 

That said, I&#39;ve been here a few times before and have ordered other breakfast menu items I&#39;ve loved, including the Wisconsin Farmhouse Omelet.

I do wish they had more side options, like fresh fruit instead of just their gingered pears and hash browns (why are hash browns so undeniably delicious compared to other potato options?) instead of just their roasted potatoes."

Glad I didn&#39;t chuck my Northface on Ebay when I moved to Orange County. My hood was up the entire time my sisters insisted we stroll downtown Geneva in the nasty, misty 38 degree weather. (I&#39;m never moving back. EVER.)

After losing a battle royale with my sister-in-law about where to take the girls to lunch (I pushed Bien Trucha HEAVILY) she won the fight and we ended up at Nosh. I was meh, but also hopeful because the Yelp reviews were favorable.

Nosh is a cute space, kind-of reminded me of Eat Chow in Costa Mesa. The service was efficient. Food was solid...I ordered the lobster bisque with a side of seasoned fries. I tried my sister-in-laws&#39;s migas de pan caliente and kicked my own *** for not listening to the local order. AMAZING. 

My neice&#39;s jalepeno cream soup was yummy as well as my mom&#39;s French toast. (I should make myself a shirt that says &#34;I&#39;m Yelp Elite, which translates to I&#39;m asking for a bite of your plate&#34;)

They offer quite a few tempting variations on eggs benedict, I just knew I was booked for an early dinner and didn&#39;t want to overindulge. 

All said, Nosh is a solid little brunch spot in Geneva. If you haven&#39;t been to Bien Trucha, and you&#39;re looking for lunch/dinner, you&#39;re missing out on something very special."

I ended up with the red eye benedict and it was fantastic.  I also had a bruleed grapefruit, which was DELICIOUS but difficult to eat in a restaurant.  I ended up with juice all over me :)

I think that the sides that come with breakfast were a little lacking.  The roasted potatoes were uninspired, as were the gingered pears.  My husband got french fries with his, which were delicious.  That would definitely be my recommendation, despite the issues I have with having french fries for breakfast.

I highly recommend the poinsettia mimosa (champagne, cranberry juice and a splash of Grand Mariner.) The Salmon Benedict was out of this world - perfect blend of flavors and just the right size.

Some restaurants get annoyed with people like me who don&#39;t want breakfast during &#34;breakfast time&#34; but not Nosh! I had the chicken salad sandwich, and it was the best chicken salad sandwich I have ever had. I loved that there were non-fried side dish items for no additional charge as well.

However, some things about this place (based on my two visits) have left me less-than-wowed. First and foremost, it&#39;s INCREDIBLY LOUD. To the point of being unpleasant. There is no music to break up the clatter either, so 30 different conversations are competing to be heard.

The second problem has been service. I will concentrate on our visit today, but things were pretty much the same on our previous visit as well, although that was a weekend breakfast and today is Monday lunch. 

There is a plethora of staff, but they all seem to be rushing around, despite the small size of the restaurant. We were seated but not given menus, given three glasses of water instead of five, all of which were less than completely filled because the guy filling them was in too much of a hurry to pour enough water. Our waitress was nice enough, but she was not the one to bring our food. The person who did bring our food just sat each plate down in any old place, despite our indication of where each belonged. They were also very slow to pick up our payment by the time we were ready to leave. None of these issues is a deal-breaker though, especially with some of their tasty food offerings...

I had small portions of the savory French toast and the Nosh French toast. Both were delicious! I have an abundant appetite, so I probably could have eaten full portions of each. Also, try the bacon. Mmm. For all of this yumminess, I will surely be back. But maybe I&#39;ll bring some ear plugs or try to sit outside, to make the experience more enjoyable for an introvert like myself."

Come here early, y&#39;all. My friend and I got here at 8:30am and had a choice of tables, but left at 10 and the parking lot was full of people standing and waiting. Yikes! But they have a HUGE parking lot and ample street parking, so that&#39;s a good thing.

Anyway, the menu is very tiny and casually printed on a tri-fold piece of paper, and the interior is teeny (but very bright and visually appealing). We both ordered coffee and I am so mad at myself for not finding out what brand they brew because it was DELICIOUS. Strong, dark, amaze. I had I think 44 cups. Approx.

The menu has so many unique and delicious sounding options, with an entire column devoted to mexican-inspired/flavors items (be still my heart). They also have lots of unique and wonderful sounding sweet items - banana foster pancakes and a french toast with a lemon creme anglaise caught my eye, but I finally settled on the crab cake benedict, and my friend got a Mexican Benedict with a jalapeño hollandaise - uhhhyum. Being completely unable to exercise self control, we also got a &#34;tasting&#34; of the chocolate french toast (for $5! So worth it! Taste the rainbow of delish pancake/french toasts for $5 each!).

I seriously LOVED the presentation of our meals. The English muffins, crab cakes, and poached eggs were so perfectly round, with the hollandaise neatly adorning them. It was a very clean looking plate. Their breakfast potatoes were simply roasted, and there were even purple potatoes in my mix. I ate every bite!

The chocolate french toast was delicious, but cloyingly heavy/sweet. A tasting would be the only way to go for me. 

Our server was bubbly, lovely, attentive, helpful, well-paced, and great. I can&#39;t wait to come back and try more dishes. SUCH a great find in quaint little Geneva!"

Fresh squeezed OJ was the bomb diggity. Multigrain toast was a nice treat.

Main dish was a Muchacho Omelette. EXCELLENT.

The food is awesome - 5 stars for sure! They have some really different menu items, specifically the different types of bennys and french toasts. I wanted to try them all! Fun fact, you can get a sampler size of different items on the menu. My friend couldn&#39;t decide between 2, so she got a half portion of each. I wish they had that on the menu! I ended up getting the benny that was like a caprese salad. Sounds weird, but it was good! Everyone I was with enjoyed what they ordered. Their coffee and cocktails are also very good.

The service was good - we always had drinks filled and plates cleared. My only issue was, since this is such a small place there is a wait (of course). That&#39;s fine. There aren&#39;t many places to sit inside and wait, so you have to wait outside. I understand that they want to get more business and get people in and out, but we felt like we were being watched and rushed the entire time. We were asked about 5 times if we wanted boxes for our leftovers. We aren&#39;t done yet!!! Simmer down. I don&#39;t want to feel like I&#39;m being rushed out of a place. I paid to be here too ya know.

If that had not been the case, this place would probably be 5 stars."

My boyfriend and i are vegetarian for the month of February and when we asked about the soup of the day she was visibly irritated at the fact we were asking about which soups had meat. One of the water glasses had a lip print on it and she seemed irritated at the fact that we brought it up. So we got the black bean soup which was delicious. We also shared the eyekeya pancakes which were amazing and you must try them! All and all the food was good but the service seemed very unprofessional especially when two women sat next to us and she was extreamly engaging to them. Oh and her reciept said her name was renee.

We were super excited to try it out, but made the mistake of going during Sunday brunch. When we were told the wait would be about an hour, we decided to go back during the week. It was much less busy and we were seated right away. 

The decor is eclectic, not my style, but very trendy. We both ordered mimosas, which were fine. It was just a little overpriced for the small size of the glass they are served it. I ordered an omelette, even though I was intrigued by another dish, but I was disappointed to find that certain menu options are only available on the weekends. I guess it makes sense as a business decision, but it&#39;s definitely off putting to customers, especially when the wait is 1+hour to even get a table on the weekends. My Wisconsin Farmhouse omelette was ok, it was on the colder side, which is always a let down, especially since we had to wait a bit for the food. 

Our server was fine, the food was fine, the environment was fine. It was not worth the price we paid. We were so excited to try, but now that we have, we probably won&#39;t be going back."

So I went with her, we were in the bathroom for maybe 3-4 minutes and when we got out our table was completely cleared with no waitress or anything in site. I was speechless. We weren&#39;t even half way through our meal. There were other open tables- they weren&#39;t that busy so I seriously didn&#39;t even know what to do. I stood at the counter where our waitress was standing and waited for her to turn around- still speechless at this point. Finally she did and I told her we weren&#39;t done eating and she just shrugged her shoulders and said oh do you want us to make you more. I walked right out of there- I&#39;ve never been treated so rudely in my life. My daughter was so disappointed and wanted to eat her pancake that was thrown away."

This place has tons of unique menu items, many of which sounded very appealing to me. I ended up going with the breakfast burrito. It was huge and so flavor-filed. It came with potatoes which were also cooked to perfection. My friends and I also split chocolate chip French toast. I am typically not a huge sweet breakfast fan...but I gotta say this was so delicious!

I would echo another review that I read on this place about feeling slightly rushed due to the space constraints.

We visit in summer more because we like their outdoor seating--which is weird because it looks out on their little parking lot. 

The only bad experience we&#39;ve ever had occurred yesterday at noon. There was a loud young couple there who swore. A lot. R rated swearing. They finally left, and a server seemed to know the patrons behind us was also very loud--but she didn&#39;t cuss!

My husband ordered the Shrimp Tacos. when the server put the plate down in front of him everyone at the table chuckled. The (3) Tacos were made with the four inch tiny tortillas which looked like something a five year old child would eat. He said the one and a half shrimp per taco was a Joke.

It&#39;s small and simple with a touch of family friendly hipster. 
It&#39;s a bit tucked away from the busy street of downtown Geneva 
but not so tucked away where you could miss it.

My boyfriend and I decided to grab a light lunch here.
It was a little too late to be considered brunch.
The place was packed with people laughing and enjoying themselves
 but we were still seated right away which was awesome! 

The waitress was a delight! 
She definitely knew the menu and had no problem giving us recommendations. 
I love service like that! Especially when it&#39;s my first time visiting. 

 My order was extremely simple. 
I like to go simple when trying a new restaurant most of the time. 
I find that if you can mess up something simple then there&#39;s little hope for the rest. 
Anyway, I went with the Basil Pesto Flatbread with a side salad and a mimosa.
The mimosa was okay, not great. I probably wouldn&#39;t order it again. 
That flatbread though...man...that was so good! 
It&#39;s not your traditional flatbread. I would say it&#39;s similar to a pizza crust. 
Not Pizza Hut pizza crust but fresh, legit made to order pizza crust.  

 My boyfriend had a crab cake trio kind of thing.
I&#39;m not sure what it&#39;s actually called on the menu but it seems to be off their menu now. 
He also had their pear side. 
He wasn&#39;t to found of the crab cake trio, he said they were a bit on the dry side.

In any case, our experience was very pleasant!

We came in on a Sunday morning (we called ahead 15 minutes to get our name on the list). Unfortunately after we checked in the two young hosts forgot about us (after telling us it would only be 5 minutes or so). We ended up going up there and they admitted that our name &#34;got lost on the list&#34; and that they would seat us next. It&#39;s not pleasant to wait here as everyone is hovering around the door and bumping in to one another on the way in. I was also hoping for some additional gluten free options. I ordered 2 eggs, the gluten free toast and bacon. Most of their prices seemed fair, but they charged me $2.50 for the toast and I was given only one slice! My sister only received one slice too so I don&#39;t think it was an oversight. I don&#39;t think I would return. Egg Harbor and Buttermilk are much better."

We first visited you about two years ago, and were quite pleased with the attentive service, the atmosphere, the quality and especially quantity of the food. This morning, however, aside from our friendly and attentive server, our trip to Nosh was a massive disappointment.

Kristina U&#39;s review is dead on: &#34;Pretentious patrons and over-priced drinks.&#34; And not just the boozy kind. And the crowd... Oh the crowd. We felt very rushed by the bus staff, plus the acoustics of the place simply made everything worse. If you don&#39;t deal well with crowds and noise - AVOID AT ALL COSTS.

Fedora wearing hipster?
Check!

Beautifully presented dishes on white plates with pretentiously drizzled condiments? Check!

Said dishes fall flat when it comes to both taste and (especially) value?

Massively over-priced drinks?

Nosh feels like it belongs in Wicker Park or Logan Square, not Geneva just West of the Fox River. All it needs is slightly more difficult parking, and they&#39;ll have nailed the whole thing perfectly.


Also, Celiacs and those with gluten issues beware. Your menu options are seriously restricted. I had the Costa Rican Breakfast - &#34;Two eggs with cheesy vegetarian pink beans served along side jicama slaw, chipotle vinaigrette and a house-made cheesy tortilla.&#34; Sounds delightful. But there simply wasn&#39;t enough of it. Not filling Not at all. And while the house-made tortillas looked beautiful, they were the most bland and tasteless thing I&#39;ve eaten in ages. The jicama slaw was the best thing I had today, but again - there simply wasn&#39;t enough of it. And the &#34;cheesy vegetarian pink beans&#34; looked, smelled, and tasted like basic re-fried beans. And again, there were barely any on my plate.

Open for only breakfast and lunch, Nosh has a menu that is full of unusual items. I&#39;m working through them menu and I&#39;ve loved everything I have tried.

The main culprit slowing down my progress is the mug as de puerco. If you like eggs there are three Spanish style eggs scrambles. The de puerco has multiple types if pork in in, chorizo, bacon, ham. It also contains croutons that are crunchy that also manage to melt in your mouth. 

Other items of not are the breakfast burrito, the nosh French toast, the Mars bars hotcakes, the lunch options (served from open to close) include a steak sandwich (they will actually cook it rare upon request), a Boursin melt (currently on special), the nosh tacos (fish or chicken). 

The fresh squeezed orange juice is a bit pricey but quite good. 


Their soups are also phenomenal. Try black bean soup!"

I&#39;m stunned that other Yelpers think this is overpriced; it&#39;s quality food and it&#39;s fairly priced in my opinion, especially compared to other independent places in the area. Fresh ingredients and well made dishes that aren&#39;t overly processed will, in fact, cost a little bit more.

The French market, btw, was not impressive.  The produce and other items are overpriced with hardly any French influence. They were selling polish sausage and tamales of all things.  Where were the crepes, foie gras and croissants?  Anyway....

After walking around town for a while we decided to dine at Nosh based on the rave reviews and the number of people dining at the establishment.  The restaurant itself is cute.  The outdoor patio faces a parking lot.  As for the food, it was just okay.   I had the French Country Baguette.  It was pretty good, but nothing to brag about.  The seasoned fries were tasty.  My mom had the chicken salad pita.  It was just so-so in flavor.  There was hardly any chicken salad in the pita.  She was also expecting for the pita to be warm, which it was not.  Her herbed potatoes were lacking in herbs and seasoning. Overall, the food is about average in taste while the service is friendly and courteous.  I&#39;m pretty sure I won&#39;t be returning."

A year later, I went back as a vegan, after another vegan recommended their menu as having a lot of options. They have some options that can be modified - the Greek wrap, the veggie panini, the NLT, etc. but the server we had yesterday was all, &#34;Vegan? What&#39;s that?&#34; And told us we must be their &#34;first vegans.&#34; I get it. She didn&#39;t know much about it. That&#39;s okay. But this is a foodie establishment - and I know they had options... So we figured it out. Ordered everything with no cheese, no cream sauces, no meat, dairy, etc. and yet there was dairy on almost everything we were delivered. We try not to be difficult about our elective diet - it&#39;s not a food allergy or anything, but seriously. At a place where breakfast entrees are $15 each, I kind of expect you to give a little bit of a damn. That being said, the food is still amazing and if you&#39;re not vegan, get the French toast or salmon Benedict. Both are epically delicious."

My husband ordered a Mexican egg dish that was a horrific pile of eggs shaped like it came out of a tuna can served in a bowl. The eggs were dry, bacon uncooked.

I had Violet&#39;s Pancakes and they were good.  About half way through it started to taste overly sweet.  I couldn&#39;t finish it.  I did like the option to half your order.  2 pancakes (the size of a dinner plate) are more than enough for me.  I also ordered a side of apple smoked bacon and it was DELICIOUS.  I&#39;d go back for the bacon alone.
My husband ordered the whole wheat french toast and he really liked it.  I would say that the food didn&#39;t blow our minds nor did we leave saying we LOVED it but overall it was good.

The only thing that was annoying was the water guy. We weren&#39;t even seated  yet, we were trying to get our 1 year old situated in her high chair while de-winterizing her (removing her bulky winter coat, hat, mittens, etc) and the water guy was reaching over us, through us, every which way he could, trying to fill our waters. Can&#39;t you just wait till we&#39;re situated and actually seated before filling our waters?  I don&#39;t understand why such a rush.  They weren&#39;t even busy.

As on past visits, when the room is full, it is very loud.  But you&#39;ll forget all about the noise when you taste the wonderful food.

Having already had the Egg&#39;r (yum), the Lorraine Omelet (Yum) and the Savory French Toast (YUM!), I decided to finally try the Jalapeno Benedict which has been calling to my taste buds since I first saw it on the menu.  I always avoided it on previous visits because I thought it would be too heavy, particularly on a work day, but was I ever wrong!  The skirt steak is done to perfection and the jalapeno hollandaise is light and fresh with just the perfect amount of heat at the back of your throat to make this a winner anyway you look at it.

My wife is not typically an eggs Benedict fan because of the richness, but she tried the salmon version and was pleased beyond compare.  Again, the hollandaise was light and fresh and the dill in the sauce was a great complement to the delicious cured  salmon. 

We both felt satisfied without being overly filled.  We love Nosh!"

I would not suggest getting the &#34;ginger honey pears&#34;. I was expecting something else, but really it just seemed like unripe slices of pears. Maybe they would be better in season, but I just did not enjoy them at all. I couldn&#39;t taste the ginger, nor the honey and I have very enhanced taste buds (or so I think).

This first visit was very disappointing to say the least. I ordered the crab cake benedict, and the crab cake was overseasoned and overfried, which overtook all the delicate flavors of the crab. Worse was the egg that came with the benedict, which was not poached but soft boiled (seriously? don&#39;t they teach you that in Cooking 101?). Mine wasn&#39;t the only problem poached egg either, 2 others received the same. I also tried out the french toast, and those were just standard albeit weirdly cut in strips like steak fries, but the taste nothing special. But then I started tasting the sauce that was on the french toast against the sauce on the crab benedict, and it ended up being the exact same bland sauce, some mystery yellow sauce that didn&#39;t seem to be hollandaise or creme anglais. I like mysteries, but what the?!?! Even the side of bacon was served cold, I could have eaten precooked microwave bacon that was crispier.
I did enjoy the fresh squeezed orange juice, the side of honey pears that came with the benedict, but come on now. When the people taking me out start saying stuff like, &#34;maybe the chef is having an off day...&#34; or, &#34;it really isn&#39;t like this usually...&#34;, that means many other people in the group are having the exact same thought, which was &#34;I wish we could rewind and go somewhere that&#39;s actually good.&#34;
Seriously, the only 2 great things about my meal was our fantastic waitress and the cool light fixture in the dining room (the great service was the only reason why I&#39;m giving this place 2 stars). Otherwise, if this meal is any indication of the average meal here, Nosh really needs to pull it together."

I figured I might as well treat my wife to somewhere new for my birthday since I still haven&#39;t found a restaurant that serves a consistently good french toast.

I expected a wait from the articles I have read but even though the restaurant was small we were quickly seated. It did seem to take a bit long for our server to acknowledge us and ask us for a beverage even though it did not seem particularly busy . My wife had trouble ordering but even though I had mentioned it was our first time here our server seemed patient but not helpful.

My wife and I both order the Nosh French Toast which is described as 
&#34;Our special recipe of challah bread soaked in vanilla-orange zest infused batter, served with lemon creme anglaise and powdered sugar&#34;

The french toast is said to be three pieces of bread but it was hard to tell since it is served slice into strips.  The french toast itself was a bit dry and although the batter and sauce seemed excellent the bread itself was thin and dry. Hardly &#34;soaked&#34;.  Looking at the toast as I worked my way down it seems that my wife and I were both served end pieces of the loaf so this may have accounted for the toughness of the meal.

The side of bacon was perfectly cooked and the herb potatoes my wife order were beautifully cooked but seasoning on the potatoes was barely noticeable. 

Overall average service, disinterested staff, unremarkable french toast adds up to our money being spent closer to home. Not worth the trip."

Noodles Pho U is fast and offers superior quality cuisine. This is my go-to place for Chinese food as well. I&#39;ve never eaten in-store, so I can&#39;t speak for them in that sense, but their take-out process is incredibly efficient and they never fail to provide the highest quality Asian cuisine. 

If you are a fan of Chinese or Vietnamese cuisine and want a no-bullshit, high quality answer, Noodles Pho U is the answer."

We came here because my husband loved noodles like I love chocolate. It was a bit spartan in decor but very clean with pleasant and efficient service.

I had the Pad Thai and iced tea. They were both very good but I was not blown away like my better half was. We shall have to return, maybe I will have that ideal meal like he did.

In the meantime keep saying noodle, it&#39;s entertaining."

We decided to come to this Noodles Pho U location because we all tried the other locations so we expect the same food and service.

The location is off a strip mall and there was plenty of parking. When we came in, it is a bigger dining area than the one in Lombard. The place is colorful and roomy, we were seated right away. 

We had a party of 12 adults and kids and ordered our drinks first. The staff was friendly and we were able to have four separate checks kewl. However, after we placed our order both our drinks and our food the service was very slow like molasses slow!

I felt like they only had two people taking care of the whole restaurant. There was even a family of four that came and sat down and was not even greeted after 10 minutes that they ended up leaving. 

I ordered the salt and pepper fried smelt fish dinner with brown rice which was extra on the side. And hubby ordered the beef Korean bipbimbop hot bowl dinner. For appetizer be ordered fresh spring rolls with shrimp and pork with peanut dipping sauce. I wish they would at least cut the spring rolls in half so we would have four pieces instead of two huge ones. The food was good as expected. However, we ordered Thai iced tea and Thai iced coffee. The Thai ice tea was not as sweet as expected. And they did not have a Thai iced coffee but Vietnamese coffee which tasted like watered down espresso coffee taste with condensed milk. It was very bitter with overly sweet flavor. All our dreams was served in a plastic to go cup instead of a glass cup. The rest of the folks who ordered their drinks ended up getting them at the middle to end of their meal, I know it takes time to make these specialty bubble tea drinks but really that&#39;s unacceptable.

The amount of food you receive is plenty that we were able to bag half of it home. 

The service again was very slow like molasses so if you are on a tight schedule or don&#39;t want to sit in a restaurant for more than two hours, then I would recommend to go someplace else.

We were not in a rush today, however I felt like the customer service was lacking a bit today. When you see a family with kids that comes into an establishment and doesn&#39;t even get menus and have their drinks ordered by 10 minutes, I would be mad and leave too. 

My recommendation is if you don&#39;t mind hanging out and catching up, then this is a place to go because the food is still good.

I would only come back here if I was in the area because of the food. But only if my friends and family were not in a rush to go somewhere afterwards and want to hang out for a while."

I&#39;ve been here a few times over the past few years, but this review is for my recent takeout order. 
   I&#39;ve been sick and dying for a hot bowl of broth to bring me back to life. After my horrible fiasco in the city (see my Belly Q review), I really needed to find a place to satisfy my craving. Luckily, Noodles Pho U popped in my head. We called and placed an order and it was ready within 15 minutes. 
   I ordered the Pho Ga (chicken pho), and hubby ordered the General chicken dinner special. We shared a jackfruit avocado tapioca smoothie. The smoothie was great and the tapioca balls were done perfectly, soft and slightly chewy. The pho ga was packaged nicely-the broth was separate from the noodles, which was separate from the toppings and sauce. I put it all together at home and it was amazing! Just what I needed for my sinuses. The general chicken was good, but a little soggy (probably because it was take out). The fried rice it came with tasted decent. The egg roll was just okay. 
   Of course there are a bagillion places in the city that I would choose to go to over Noodles Pho U, but when you are stuck in the suburbs and Joy Yees is too far and/or closed, you will not be disappointed if you order from here. I&#39;ll definitely be ordering again from here when I get that hot soup craving."

we were seated immediatley and waited long for the server to come to us. I orderded the regular beef pho and my fiancee ordered the bun thit noung. the pho is just average flavor and taste aren&#39;t just there. portion size is not big enough for the price that they were asking.more like half size than the ones I get in different vietnamese restaurant. but atleast it had good meat in it.. and for the bun thit noung. I was not a big fan at all. noodles is cold and it has a bitter after taste in it. maybe it was the old lettuce or the meat. but the sauce was good. but dissapointed because if you ask for extra sauce they charge you for it.

and after we finished eating. I think it took us 30mins to wait for our check to come.. I gave three stars because I love vietnamese cuisine as I love filipino food. so I hope they can fix the issue here. until I come back next time.."

The Korean stone bowl was sooooo good....
HOWEVER.
If you plan to order this, be known (and this comes from someone who cooks/cooked rice every freaking day- I&#39;m an African.) The bowl will burn that rice you so desperately want to eat. It stays so hot that by the time I got to actually eat the rice, it was crunching and stuck in my molars. It&#39;s SO good, but so hot! But was Deliiicious the next day when I heated it to normal my mouth can handle this temp. The Thai iced tea is delicious as well, used it to cool my mouth after a spoonful of heat. I got it veryyy sweet, which was perfect. So good! (Sauce called devil spit was not really spicy to me, personally, then again, I eat stew with 2-3 habenero peppers blended in, so, idk how reliable I am) my friend got the pho with jalapenos, extra noodles, but couldn&#39;t eat everything."

While it did took them a while to finish the name transition, eventually, they did put up an updated sign and this Chinese/Sushi restaurant is now a Vietnamese/Chinese/Thai/Korean pan asian place of cuisine. 

I&#39;ve been here twice up to date and originally, my first thought of it was a &#34;meh&#34;. Their Pho was A-OK but it just took a really long time for the order to come out.. like 20-30 min wait long. I&#39;m Vietnamese and I&#39;m my bar for Vietnamese food is a bit higher since I know what tastes good to me and what doesn&#39;t, and I also have a certain wait time expectation since most Pho and noodle dishes should have their broth prepared ahead of time, so I&#39;m not sure what could cause them to take that long. I went home that day thinking this place is 3 stars at best. 

Nevertheless, my family gave it another try today and my taste buds told me differently, 4 stars. The wait time for 4 people (3 dishes, 1 appetizer, 2 smoothies) were still the same however. I clocked them at about 30-35 min wait. However, everything came out tasting really good, savory, flavored just right (not too salty or bland) and that really made up for the wait time. The server, Truc, was very nice and polite and were friendly toward us and kept us updated with the wait (a small gesture that was appreciated when most restaurants lacked). 

Here&#39;s my report card of this place: 

#50 Banh Xeo- B+ (8 pieces in small ceramic plates, authentic to taste, flavorful, good, and should be eaten right away when hot for optimal taste, once it&#39;s cold, you wont get the full flavor) $8.95 is a little pricey but since this isn&#39;t a common dish at most restaurants, it&#39;s worth a try. Would be nice if they lowered the price on this a bit. It&#39;s costing as much as an entree for app.

#200 Bun Thit Nuong- A+. At first I thought this portion was small, but I ended up not finishing it (could be due to my smoothie drink I had been sipping). The pork was VERY flavorful and true to Vietnamese cuisine, the noodles were soft and not dry, pickled radishes and lettuce was fresh and compliments the dish. I would get this again! $8.95 is about right for this. 

Other dishes that I didn&#39;t ordered but my family did was #122 Pho Special and #300 Pork Chop Rice. You can request to have a sunny side egg with the latter dish (true to how Vietnamese people eat it). My family said both dish were decent and they finished it all. Rice is sometimes a miss or hit dish, since some restaurant can cook it well or undercook it or have it to dry, and that can really break or make a dish. If the rice is too dry, then you don&#39;t have that to compliment the flavor of the dish. In addition, nuoc mam, or fish sauce is also another break or make it ingredient. It is the final flavor of everything Vietnamese. This restaurant make the fish sauce well, and I heard the rice was okay, sounds good. 

Smoothies I recommend and have tried: Avocado and Papaya. My favorite being avocado. They used fresh fruits here and may put a bit more ice and sugar into it, so it can taste sweet but over all, their smoothies are decent at $3.50-$4.75/drink. 

There is Lunch/Dinner special here but nothing on that menu is Vietnamese, only basic Chinese dishes so I would personally take a pass. There is delivery here with a $10 purchase minimum. Ambience is very casual and in need of some redecoration, a about 8 tables of 4 can fit here, so it&#39;s not really a large place. 

My final verdict for this place, if you&#39;re nearby, give it a try. I certainly will come back. However, it&#39;s NOT a place to go when you&#39;re in a hurry. Give yourself at least 30 minutes for the food to come out. I think they are low in staff so service and food is a bit slow. Other than that, I&#39;m coming back here for my Vietnamese cravings. Check it out! :)"

The bf had the coconut chicken lunch special it was delicious I definitely should have went with that option however I thought I would go with a dish I was more so familiar with...bad decision. Before leaving i made it a point to inform an employee that I was dissatisfied with the food and asked what type of sauce was on it. He went to the cook to ask, came back and told me soy sauce, hoisin sauce, and fish sauce. Being knowledgeable of these sauces I don&#39;t understand the blandness. I am not a fan!

To say the least we had a great time! They have also finished updating their interior, which is a big improvement from the last few times when it was still under construction.

My 8 year old son and I had visited this establishment on Thursday 11/14/2013 at 7:20 PM. We were welcomed by a gentleman with glasses, who appears to be in his mid 40&#39;s and a younger gentleman who appears to be in his early twenties. Both had told us to go ahead and sit wherever we like. We walked ourselves to a table against the wall, next to the window, and sat down. Shortly after, a lady named Kem provided us with menus and walked away and did not come back until the moment I looked up, to asked if we were ready to order.  At this point, it was approximately 7:28 PM.She did not write down our order, but had asked for a repeat just so she heard us correctly. My son order a Ramune ( soda pop) for $2.00, #130 Pho Bo Vien( meat ball) for $7.95,  and I  ordered #120 Pho Xe Lua( eye of round slice, brisket, shank, tendon, beef ball, &amp; tripe) for $8.95 with  two glasses of  ice water. Yes. I had to ask for ice water. 

Keep in mind, it is 45 degrees outside. The restaurant as freezing. All the patrons inside kept their jackets on.  The walls are painted a light gray. Think of the color of the tool bar from windows 95. It&#39;s gray and dull. The floors are light wood and the seating appears to be purchased from IKEA.  

She brought out the waters, Ramune, and two plates to bean sprouts, sliced jalapenos, sliced limes, and basil sprigs. Please note that the ice water had a hint of lime, not of my own doing. Both plates of bean sprouts were fresh and firm. The sliced jalapenos looked dried and old. The lime was for sure dried and old because when we tried to squeeze it over our soups, it was rock hard and did not provide any juice. Lastly, the basil was wilted. 

My son&#39;s #130 Pho Bo Vien( meat ball) came out first. There was chopped green onions, cilantro, and sliced raw onions. The description of the dish includes &#34;meat ball&#34;. It literally means one meat ball, sliced into thin pieces. The bowl was relatively large filled with lots of noodles and to the brim with soup. The soup lacked flavor. 

The  #120 Pho Xe Lua that I ordered came out 5 minutes after my son&#39;s. It was in what I would call an extra large bowl, lots of noodles, filled to the brim with soup, garnished with chopped green onions, cilantro, and sliced raw onions. My pho had very small portions of meats as well. The soup lacked flavor.

In the middle of our meal, an inch long centipede was crawling on the wall of which  my son against. I walked to grab the older gentleman with the the glasses, pointed to the thing crawling up the wall,  and he killed the centipede with a napkin from our table.  He had no reaction to the fact that there was a centipede crawling up the wall. As if this sort of thing was a normal day occurrence at all restaurant dining rooms.There was no apology from the restaurant employees  that our dining experience was affected by a surprise guest. 

The bill with tax of $1.90 was a total of $20.80, which we had to ask the server for. I had originally put down $25, waiting for her to come pick it up so that I can get change. Waited, and nothing. So, I ended up taking the $5 back and putting 4 quarters and 2 singles.She came rushing over to grab the payment. Did not ask if I needed change. A curt &#34;thank you&#34; and walked off. 

As my son exited the restaurant, the younger gentleman who appears to be in his early twenties, did not even look up from his phone and said &#34;thank you&#34;.

I&#39;ve read so many positive reviews from Yelp Elites. I have to say I was very disappointed with my overall experience. As someone who lived by The Noodle in Chinatown for over 6 years and moving out to Bolingbrook, I was honestly looking for something that would become a &#34;like home&#34; restaurant."
noodles-pho-u-bolingbrook,Jasmine C.,jPA-mBSFwmCLMe1kwHSXWg,"Bolingbrook, IL",0,1,0,0,71,JhZdksejNbZZAwPbHlXhzA,1.0,2015-10-20,"It&#39;s a shame my first online review has to be a negative one.

Why was the restaurant closed before it was supposed to be? I&#39;ve worked in different facets of the restaurant and hospitality industry, and this is by far one of the worst things I&#39;ve come across service wise. As a business, this is unacceptable. There is nothing that excuses shutting down half an hour early (or perhaps sooner than this) when you still have orders that were already paid for and awaiting pick up. It&#39;s essentially stealing, pure laziness, and horrible staffing/management. 

I placed an order at the Bolingbrook location today around 8:30 pm. At 8:45 pm, I got a call from them saying they were out of ice cream and was offered a smoothie. Okay no big deal, that&#39;s nothing to fuss about, so I took it. There was no notification (e-mail or verbal) of any other problems with my order, nothing saying that my order was ready, or any implication that they would be shutting down early, so I left five minutes later expecting to be in and out of the restaurant with my food.

I got there shortly after 9:00 pm to find the lights off, the door locked, and another confused customer. After looking around to see if maybe someone was inside, I tried calling multiple times with no response. I even tried knocking on the door. Still no answer. The website says they close at 9:30 pm. The sign on the door says 9:30 pm. I even called the Lombard location to confirm that I had the right closing time, and sure enough I was right. In the ten minutes it took for the restaurant employee to call me, and for me to drive to the restaurant, everyone had left... Before closing. It doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s dead on a Tuesday night or a busy Friday dinner rush. You wait until the last order is filled and delivered/handed to the customer before packing up! It&#39;s part of the industry! What, were they waiting for me to pay for my food so that they could make it and take the order for themselves?

Where was the food that I spent roughly $40 on? Clearly not in my hands, nor did it magically appear in my stomach because I&#39;m still hungry and quite angry at this point. It was a waste of time trying to navigate the god awful system they have for online orders, a waste of gas and time going to their so called establishment only to be faced with this nonsense, and a waste of more time because now I will be calling my credit card company to dispute the charges. I got no food, so why would they get my money? I&#39;d rather order elsewhere in town or make the drive to H-Mart or Mitsuwa.

You are a restaurant. The basic definition of your job is to feed people and provide them with service in a hospitable manner. Clearly you&#39;ve failed at understanding this."

Came here with a couple people and was highly disappointed. We all ordered smoothies and I kid you not, it took almost 30 minutes. It took 20 something minutes to even be greeted or given water while we wait. I don&#39;t like to be a negative Nancy, but in the past have worked the service industry and I know how things should go; it&#39;s really not THAT hard. There were only 3 other tables with people besides us so being busy can&#39;t even be used as an excuse for the lack in service. The drinks came out separately while one of them sat on the counter until I went up and said something. Food eventually came out and it tasted good, but my overall experience was so terrible I couldn&#39;t really enjoy it. We finished our food and paid the tab and left. I am all for small business but I will never come back here."

 We ordered the shrimp summer roll which was 5 pieces of shrimp, rolled in rice paper, with romaine, and rice. I took 2 bites with the peanut dipping sauce and I wasn&#39;t impressed.  The Singapore rice noodles tasted like ramen noodles with 8 small shrimp a couple of dry pork slives and a couple onion and pepper spices. My boyfriend had the sweet and sour chicken which was ok nothing special.  We shared the beef egg foo young which was bland and had really no flavor.  The best part was the egg drop aoup."

It was unfortunate that the worker seemed to not really know how to properly make a simple milk tea drink. The one milk tea drink took a total of 15 minutes for him to make - even though we were the only ones in line. Originally the worker gave me a straw that was too small to even eat the bubba in my drink and he seemed very confused why I had asked for a larger straw. The drink itself was mediocre at best.

I would suggest having more professionally trained workers before entrusting them with the front end of your business."

Perhaps it is just not my thing, or I need to try different menu items.  I cannot say it was a horrible experience, just not all that special.

I ordered from their website, which offers brief but accurate descriptions of their food.  The ordering process was easy, and the food arrived fresh, hot, and on time.  No complaints from me in that department.

The food was hit or miss.  I had ordered both shrimp and chicken summer rolls.  Granted, I have never eaten them before, so I have nothing to really compare them with.  I really could not tell the difference between the two rolls.  They just had a very rubbery texture and little to no actual flavor.  I did really enjoy the peanut sauce for dipping; that sauce was absolutely fantastic!

I also had the Japanese dumplings, which 12 of them for $6.95 is a great deal.  I can only describe them as a cross between Gyoza and pot stickers; good, but nothing spectacular.

The most delightful part of my meal was the spicy beef noodle soup.  Everything was packaged separately, and you could assemble it to your liking.  The broth had the perfect amount of spice, and the beef tendon really made the dish!  This is definitely going to be my new kick-the-winter-blah go-to soup.  Although it was soup, it is really large enough to be a meal in itself. 

Since the menu here touts itself as Pan-Asian,  the menu is very extensive.  Since ordering is so simple, and there are plenty of things to try, I will definitely be a returning customer here."

I was sent emails and texts informing me that the food would arrive between 8:10-8:20.  I finally called them at 8:50 as an hour and a half passed and still no food.  The restaurant was completely unconcerned about my ridiculous wait and the guy just said hey had a lot of orders.  Umm....then inform me of that when I&#39;m ordering!!!   I would not have ordered had I know it would take such a long time. To make matters worse, I was told the food would arrive in 5 minutes from the time I called.  A half hour later, the restaurant called and told me it would be 20 minutes more!  Two and a half hours to wait for a meal?  Seriously??  Forget it.  They lost my business forever...and I will tell everyone and anyone about the rudeness and lack of concern this restaurant gave me.  Despicable"

I think that&#39;s what made the experience all the more pleasant.  The elder woman serving us was very friendly and made conversation with us frequently.  We ordered fried calamari as an appetizer.  It was crispy and a little spicy, which was great.  The dipping sauce was really good with it too.  We also ordered the Vietnamese Crispy Crepe (Bahn Xeo) which was delicious and flavorful probably my favorite of what we ordered.  Then I ordered Pho Tai Gan which has eye round steak and tendon.  I loved it.  The broth was pretty good and they didn&#39;t skimp out on the tendons which is awesome.  It was a good size, too.  I was able to finish it off without feeling too disgusting.

Prices are also really good for what it is.  Compare it to Joy Yee where it&#39;s probably $2 or $3 more for less than mediocre pho and bahn mi.  If you want authentic Vietnamese food this is the place to go.

After we finished, our waitress (and presumably the owner?) expressed her gratitude for dining with them and to spread the word because they were in need of more customers.
