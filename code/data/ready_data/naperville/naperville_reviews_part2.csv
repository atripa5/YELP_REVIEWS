   I always look to the off menu items...the specials.  Sometimes they&#39;ll last a week, a month...or a few days.  I recommend getting the special soup and the special entree/sandwich.  What you&#39;ll find is properly made, well balanced meals by a respected chef.  My recommendation is to come for a number of soups, and a number of specials in order to get a feel for his cooking, his execution of proper technique and his interpretations of flavors on food (ie: choice of homemade buns, flavor in homemade sausage/protein).  Really, where else in the area are you going to find a properly made demi-glace!  I mean, really!  Come in...and give it a good chance"

They&#39;re deceitful liars.


There was a special on a table tent for bourbon. $5-$10 on higher end bourbons. 

We ordered four $5 bourbon on the rocks, one draft beer and a N/A beer. The bill was $50. 

When questioned, the manager explains there&#39;s an extra charge for ice. And a significant one at that. 

I was mad, but embarrassed in front of my guests and just signed the bill. 

Don&#39;t go. They&#39;ll find a way to rip you off"

They open at 4 which is fine but Im often seeking a beer and a bite at lunch and wished they opened for lunch. Loved the place. Great beer selection! Uncommon choices! Food was good , service was better. I even managed to strike up a conversation w/ two total strangers while watching the Cubs WS game. That is not easy to do these days. 
Karen was the bartender, very friendly and helpful. Smiling often. Good lady! Place had a good vibe. It was clean, tables spread out giving a feeling of roominess and it did get crowded when the game started. Washrooms were clean. I only had time for an appetizer. Had the 3 sliders. Tasty, well prepared and left me wanting more. I will return another day &amp; you should too!"

After I got the drink I ordered the sever came back to our table about 5 minutes later indicating she had brought me the wrong drink and handed me a different one, which I took a sip of. I told her I believed I had the right one since I had ordered a cider and what she handed me was a dark beer. She apologized and went to another table and handed the same drink I took a sip of to another client. I had to walk over and remind the server that I had taken a sip out of it so she needed to get a new glass for the client. I ordered the chicken dinner that came with soup (which the sever never brought to our table). When my plate came the chicken was more like fried chicken not lightly battered like the menu indicated therefore I wasn&#39;t happy with it. My whole experience was just not a great one so I would not recommend this place to anyone. I&#39;m giving this review 2 stars only because the server was nice and because they do have a big beer selection but they can do a lot better."

There were both drafts and bottles available and well organized on their respective menus. 

Not being packed on a Friday night, I was glad to easily get a seat. The bar had a really great seat to table height ratio; short women rejoice. I asked the barmaid for her favorite food choices, as I usually do for new places. Some just give me what everyone else likes, some actually tell me their personal favorites. She listed too many and I just settled on pizza. They have a huge window for half priced pizzas on Fridays; 4-10 PM. Which I also found out its for dining in only, unless you order a beer. 

I got my 14&#34; pizza with mushrooms and bacon, as you have a choice from 12 or so toppings. Pay per topping. It was thin crust and pretty tasty. The only weird thing (to me) was they cut it in squares, which I&#39;m not exactly a huge fan of doing. 

I would definitely return to this joint."

Finally my neighbors who have always raved about the place talked us into going. We were there early evening on a Sunday. 4 families with kids ranging in ages from 4-10. Thank goodness for most of the night it was mostly just us because we are a loud bunch. Our server never batted an eye. She may have very well hated out guts (I&#39;ve served before and I probably would&#39;ve been annoyed with us!) but she was nothing but awesome. The food was pretty awesome too. I tried one of my neighbors jalape√±o poppers and will definitely be ordering those next trip. We ordered the combo platter and everything on it was good! The mozzarella sticks were some of the best I ever had and the potato skins were a meal in them self! For dinner I had the pot roast sandwich with mashed potatoes and my husband had one of the spicy burgers. We both loved our choices. The kids all shared some pizza which was also great.

I talked to the waitress about it, but it&#39;s possible she couldn&#39;t hear me either. The beer selection was good, the food was not bad. I liked the fact that a lot of it seemed homemade (hand breaded stuffed mushrooms, real mashed potatoes.) But overall, the flavor wasn&#39;t there.

The atmosphere is solid but it can be a little noisy at times. There are plenty of TV&#39;s to watch if you come during a sports event. Plenty of beers to choose from including both bottled and on draft. The only reason I&#39;m knocking a star off is because the quality of the pizza changed in the last few months. I used to be a regular when they would have their pizza specials because they were so delicious, but more recently they have become somewhat tasteless.

They had Californian Laguanitas, and 3 Sheep from Wisconsin. They also had beer from a nearby brewery in Lemont. Other than these, nothing else very interesting. They did have a nice Whiskey selection. We went on a Tuesday night and it was semi-noisy.

We&#39;ve been back maybe a dozen more times as we live about 5 minutes from here. The hours are a little odd because they don&#39;t open until 4PM. The same people own the Southern Belle breakfast place right next to it.

The food has always been consistent. The service has always been great with the exception of one server who gets confused pretty easily. The bartenders know what they&#39;re doing and are usually willing to give samples if there are any questions about certain taps. The beer selection started off really varied and interesting but has since devolved into a hop lovers paradise with not much in the way of lighter brews (pilsners, lagers, etc.). That&#39;s fine for me but my wife isn&#39;t a fan of bitter beer (her words) so she&#39;s hoping they come around.

There are about 15 seats at the bar, maybe 6 hi-tops that seat 4 each and 8 or 9 low tables that can be pushed together for groups. 22 large screen TVs mean everybody gets a view if they want to see whatever sports game is showing. Restrooms are clean and large. Like every other place in Joliet and Crest Hill there are 4 or 5 gaming machines along one wall.

The pizza here was a nice surprise as are the wings, stuffed jalepenos and mushrooms, and grinder sandwiches. all excellent. The burgers, wraps, salads,etc are all good. We haven&#39;t tried the pasta dishes.

We&#39;ll probably be somewhat regulars as long as they can make it with those limited hours..."

Drinks: come for the great beer and whiskey selection.  24 rotating mostly American microbrews and 100+ in bottles. Extensive collection of whiskey: at least 80 bottles of bourbon, rye, Scotch, Irish and the like. Tasty cocktails too if that&#39;s your thing. 

Food: the food is probably my favorite pub food in the area, but can lack consistency. The burgers are a generous 10oz with tons of choices for toppings. My favorites: Ring of Fire (spicy and delicious), Like a Rolling Stone (can&#39;t go wrong with bacon and a fried egg) and Revolution (cherry peppers, avocado and onion straws). Wings, apps and pizza are great too. 

People: staff is (mostly) great. Seen a few good and not so good ones come and go since the beginning, but overall I love these people. Especially the bartenders and manager/owner Nick. 

Overall: sit at the bar, ask for a sample or two and try a new craft brew, order some wings and a burger, and enjoy. 90% of the time, it works every time."

I ordered the spicy garlic wings which were way too spicy and no garlic at all and the horseradish peppercorn wings. Good sauce but just doesn&#39;t pair well with chicken. My boyfriend ordered the pot roast sandwich and it was very dry.

Now, when I went here in December of 2014 I was able to use the groupon on specials, then a couple weeks later into the new year, rules changed and I couldn&#39;t use the groupon on the friday special for half- priced pizza, which was very disappointing. If I don&#39;t have a groupon for this place I wouldn&#39;t go."

First off, it&#39;s located right next to Southern Belles in Crest Hill. Wish we would have known that as our GPS took a backwards way of getting there. Their beer selection was great. They could probably use a not more description for those of us that are not beer officiandos. The sample sizes were decent. The burgers were awesome. Good size, yummy bun and lots of options to deal with. The environment was straight up sports bar. There were probably 10 large screen tvs. Definitely would be an awesome place to watch Sunday afternoon football. To top it all off the service was great from start to finish."

What a great find! Many beers to choose from (the flight of beer was great) and the burgers were good. We didn&#39;t have the wings but they looked like a good size and we will be ordering those the next time we go. The pricing of their menu and craft brews was very reasonable and not over priced. They have alot of TV &#39;s and when we asked for a game on one of them they were quick to put it on for us. The owner was wonderful and took time to talk to us even though he was very busy helping out his staff due to a person calling off. We liked the fact he was right in there helping out, not afraid to work to try to make things easier for his staff. Can&#39;t wait to go back and bring some friends with us!"

We like going to try the different beers that they have for the season. Have gotten many different menu items and just cant pick a favorite they are all so yummy. You wont leave there hungry.

I got over it and ended up having a good time  The hawks were playing and they had it cranked up so loud you couldn&#39;t hear your friends sitting next to you but not a big deal for me cause I was watching the game but everybody else I was with hated it. I had a good time but it was a bit pricey I spent $50 on 4 craft drafts, 10 wings and a salad for my gf I will probably be back maybe alone at the bar for the beer but if your trying to save money and eat and drink I would go somewhere else, but I could see coming here alone after work to unwind, next time I will sit at the bar and see what&#39;s good hope this helps you make a decision I would say try it out if you&#39;re Into good craft draft."

It was my first time here and probably my last as it definitely is not worth the drive from Aurora. Cool interior but the food was just average. Thought the meals were overpriced for what you get. The grilled cheese for $10 was a total joke and maybe worth half that. Very small and something out of a cafeteria. The steak sandwich was tasty and better. The half price pizza is a good deal but they screwed up our order. The fries are mediocre. Drinks are fine. This place definitely needs some help in the kitchen as the meals are very inconsistent. Service was good at times but also not good at others. It too was inconsistent.

The water was served in what looked to be modeled after a milk bottle when milk was delivered every day.  I love the details, so this immediately made my first dining experience at this establishment a little cozier.

My guy and I ordered a bottle of their wine; he had the chicken parmigiana while I had the rigatoni bianco.  We had a bite of each others&#39; dinner, but were too selfish to share any more than that!

The food is delicious, the staff are friendly, and it wasn&#39;t a restaurant wherein you had to strain to hear your dining partner from across the table.  We have gone back since, ordered different items, and I suggest you order the pizza bread for your appetizer.  Delicious!"

Their service stinks, however. I placed an order on their website for several items, and requested to use a coupon for a free dessert on orders over $20 which was an offer on their printed menu. The coupon had no expiration or stipulations other than the $ minimum. However, after placing my order, I get a voicemail from a random company I wasn&#39;t expecting telling me that my order will be processed and my credit card charged but Pietanzas refused the coupon. I call Pietanzas to ask why, and am told they don&#39;t want to honor their coupon because they use this shell service to process online orders and the fees are too high. I say, not my fault. Nothing on their website or coupon says no coupons or I would have just called in. I ask to cancel my order, and am told that they&#39;ll cancel my food order but my cc will still be charged until I go through this other company. I don&#39;t want to go through hoops and ladders to get a refund from a shell service hiding in their mobile app that I didn&#39;t realize I was using. Of course, I do, and have to wait 24-48 hrs for a refund, and double check that it posts.  The whole reason I was happy to order online (prior to this experience) is because they have repeatedly (and I do mean repeatedly) forgotten or gotten elements of our orders wrong in the past. I never called to complain in the past, because it wasn&#39;t worth the hassle, but I finally had it today. Why offer a service you don&#39;t want your customers to use (because of fees) and penalize your customers. The easiest thing would have been for the guy to say sorry, I&#39;ll give you the free piece of cake, next time please call to use coupon.  How much does it cost to get a new repeat customer? Now, the manager can check our order history and ask himself if losing a customer was worth the $1-2 profit on that piece of cake.

****Edit**** added an image which clearly does not indicate when starting an order that you are using some other service. On additional pages, branding is subtle enough to be overlooked, which is what they intended. Telling me it&#39;s my fault for not realizing I was inadvertently signing up for a shell service IS NOT good management/service skills. Also, as I mentioned, your coupon had no expiration and was printed on your menu. Additionally, the other company said they called you to verify the coupon use, and that you specifically chose to not honor it. So don&#39;t try and say the other company was at fault. This is on you. You even told me on the phone that you would have honored had we called in our order, but not online because you don&#39;t like paying the third party fees!!  Guess what, if you don&#39;t like the fees, don&#39;t use the service.  Next, people order food when they are tired and not feeling up to cooking, so the idea of calling and fighting over some missing arrancinni or cake when all you want to do is sit down and eat is a big reason why MANY people don&#39;t bother calling in on a mistake. 

At the end of the day, the manager shouldn&#39;t be in management. There are many solutions to any given problem, and the goal is to choose the best solution that most achieves your aim. If his goal was to deescalate the situation and turn a negative situation into an opportunity to shine, he chose the worst (which was to do nothing, and continue doing nothing), and blame customer for the restaurants deceptive practice, no matter how unintentional.

In the end, he chose the best solution....to losing a customer."

Ribs are better than Hawthorne&#39;s backyard or Smokin BBQ  by far .The portion sizes are huge especially the lasagna definitely two dinners out of one order..
The owner and their sons have been there every time we came in for dinner and you don&#39;t see that too often anymore in the restaurant business it makes for a great experience.

I had spaghetti with meat sauce and LOVED IT.  I am very picky about meat sauce.  There was no water in the bottom of my bowl! Yay! Our wait staff was Tony, the chef&#39;s son.  He was quite friendly, supremely efficient, and accurate.  He did not mind making 7 separate checks.  My husband had meat ravioli with meat sauce and ate it all, almost licking the plate.  Others had absolutely succulent looking lasagna and chicken marsala, among other dishes I did not see.  My husband and I will make this our go-to Italian restaurant from now on.  Salad was romaine and other vegetables.  Fresh and crisp.  When we left, there was a softball team up front eating several delicious looking pizzas.

First, it&#39;s very close to my home which makes it more convenient. 

They always provide great customer service and they are friendly and they make sure that you get your food on time. 

They have a very extensive menu which is a good thing because you may want to change it up a bit and the options are very authentic which makes it even better. 

The prices are decent, not as expensive as other pizza parlors. 

Last but not least their pizza is phenomenal! I really enjoy their thin crust. The pizza is very cheesy and the sauce is sweet and delicious.

Let me start by saying that all their dishes are homemade. I had the Shrimp Diavolo, and my girlfriend got the lasagna. 

The pasta was cooked perfectly, and the sauce was very flavorful. You can see the fresh diced garlic, and small diced onions in the sauce. The shrimp was tail on, and you pick it up and eat it. It was good. The sauce could have been a little more spicy, but I can&#39;t foul them for that, because I love real spicy food. 

The lasagna was a nice large portion. It had plenty of cheese, and plenty of flavor! The sauce was delicious, and it was cooked perfect!

Also, both times we&#39;ve ordered from here, the food showed up piping hot! I love that.

Ordered a large half sausage half pepperoni, the Mediterranean bread (their version of garlic bread), and a chefs salad. Picked up my order and the staff is very friendly. I dig great customer service because it makes me want to keep patronizing the place. 
   
   Got home and the boys tore into the pizza. No complaints. The salad was fresh and homemade. Not like just lettuce and a few vegetables. But a seriously great put together salad. Huge slivers of carrots, fresh mushrooms, green pepper, red onions, olives, Italian meats and cheeses.  Nothing about this salad screamed premade. The dressing was great. Almost like a vinegar and oil with a sweetness to it. Fantastic. 

   Mediterranean bread had big chunks of garlic and seasoning. It was sprinkled with Parmesan cheese. This wasn&#39;t a hotdog bun with some garlic butter smeared on it. There was some thought put into this bread. 

   We ordered a standard regular crust pizza. Sausage and pepperoni were good. Crust was nice and crunchy. The sauce was great and again had a little sweetness to it. It&#39;s nothing like any pizzeria in the Chicagoland area. I grew up in Addison where we had hundreds of pizzerias and I never had this kind of sauce. Pizza was cooked perfectly. 

I talked with the gentleman at the counter (owner?) and told him this was my first order. He seemed genuinely nice and stated he hoped we enjoyed the order. He mentioned they moving and opening a pizzeria on Army Trail Rd and 59 for take out and sit down after the new year. The only bummer is we&#39;re going to have to drive a little farther for this food but it&#39;s going to be worth it. Thank you Pietanzas for not just being a normal run of the mill pizzeria but a restaurant that puts pride into their food."

Our recent order I instantly became volatilely sick on.
 I may have receive food where either the meat quality was expired or the burned dessert I received may have been left over too long before I got it. I was so hungry I tried to eat around the dessert, my food this time was not fresh as usual. I understand that this can occur with many restaurants and I am only commenting to this because I was greatly disappointed.
I have ordered there several times, I guess after so many times you are going to have a bad experience once in awhile, just the law of averages."

Plus, it&#39;s so much closer to my home than I realized that I can&#39;t believe it took us so long to get out and try their food. 

Their menu is a bit much for a carry out joint. At least that&#39;s what I thought when I originally checked it out online. We ordered a pasta combo with ravioli, manicotti and a meatball with the side soup, the salmon vesuvio with the side salad, arancini and the Mediterranean garlic bread. With our $20+ order, we received a small cheese pizza. I now feel pretty strongly that I am grateful for the options especially since the vast majority of our first order was delicious!

Lemme get the &#39;misses&#39; out of the way.  We did not love our free cheese pizza.  I know it&#39;s rediculous to complain about something that was free, but it wasn&#39;t very good. I am guessing that their free pizza might mislead people into thinking that their regularly ordered pizza isn&#39;t any good. Why?  The pizza had clearly been made sometime earlier, it was pulled from a hot box and it was rubbery when we ate it. Now, the crust had a nice taste and the sauce was flavorful, but because I think it had been sitting for a while, I didn&#39;t get that fresh pizza affect.  (It is highly likely that we will order a pizza next time to prove to ourselves that they make a great pizza...)  And the Mediterranean garlic bread was not something I would order again. It was very dry, so it soaked up the marinara sauce well, but it ended up being unnecessary. 

The perks?  Everything else!  The prices were right in line with what I would expect. The salmon vesuvio was cooked beautifully and still piping hot when I got it home. The pasta combo was devoured by my hubby. The meatball was clearly homemade and bursting with real Italian lovin&#39;!  There was complimentary focaccia included which made me swoon!  The salad was fresh, crisp and the perfect size. The arancini...ricey, cheesy, meaty goodness and complimented just right with a kicking marinara sauce.  The front counter guy was quirky and kind. The waiting area had a few chairs. They also had a full case of soda options. 

Side note.  I was waiting for my food when a gentleman walked in. We waited in silence until five minutes later when another gentleman walked in. They clearly knew each other and started speaking in Italian. The nice thing about the Italian language is that it is accompanied by hand gestures. Here&#39;s what I gathered:

1: Hey man!  How&#39;ve you been?  
2: Hey!  I&#39;m so good now that I&#39;ve bumped into you!
1: You&#39;re the greatest!  How&#39;s the family?
2: They&#39;re doing well. Well, at least they will be once I get home with dinner. They wanted Italian food and I went to Caputo&#39;s, but couldn&#39;t find anything that looked good, so here I am. 
1: Ha ha ha!  My son loves the sausage and bacon pizza here at Pietanza&#39;s, so I&#39;m here every other day!

They went on to talk about the old neighborhood and that kid Johnny and such, but the moral of this story is that I must go back and try their pizza."

By far the best Italian restaurant in area, no competition. Great price point. Enormous amount of food--entrees could be family style. Ordered Arancini, Patate con Basciamella, Fried Calamari, Vegetable Risotto, Mushroom &amp; Chicken Risotto and Chicken Parmigiana. Everything was fresh, cooked perfectly and tasted homemade. 

Arancini were bigger than golf balls. The Patete/Potatoes smelled like Christmas with rosemary. Calamari was not rubbery at all, had rings &amp; bodies. Each Risotto entree must have been 1lb/piece. Only surprise was Chicken Parmigiana not being breaded."

It was so huge we had to put it in the trunk. 

Pizza itself was very good. We also got mozz sticks. Also delicious. Love a good mozzarella stick. There were five of us, and we ate less than half the monster pizza. Whoops, definitely over-ordered. The total was around $30 for all this food! All in all, pretty good."

All I hear at work is Pizza this and pizza that. And being a 3rd shifter, it is very hard to get pizza at 2 in the morning. 

Well, finally, I had a day off and of course, what I want is pizza. So.... I did a review of pizza places around me and sorted them by highest review. And what would you know.... Pietanza is right at the top. In fact, is the top and only one in the top. &#34;Hey....&#34; i pondered for a minute. &#34;I think I will get pizza from here&#34;, as I replied by not so obvious question. 

I ordered the pizza with a friendly man on the phone. He asked if it was delivery or pickup and then what I wanted and he said my name. &#34;Whoa...&#34; I thought. Either he is psychic and knew I was calling OR he has caller ID. I just figured it was the first because fate wanted me to eat pizza and fate bought me here. 

After about 17 minutes, I left to pick up my pizza. He said arrive in 25 minutes and Google said the place was 7 minutes away. Give an extra minute for the busy red light and off I was to get my pizza. I arrived and picked up my deliciously smelling pizza. Drove home as fast as I could going the speed limit. Well, actually, I was driving under the speed limit. Today must be &#34;Drive 5-10 under the speed limit day&#34; or something. I will have to google this because that occured to me while driving there and while driving back. 

BUT...back to the review. The pizza was delicious and I will be back. End of story. Thank-you. Yummy!!!"

Pietanza&#39;s is AMAZING.  Their menu is really extensive--with some restaurants, it means that they do a lot of dishes in a mediocre fashion (::coughCHEESECAKEFACTORYcough::) but for Pietanza&#39;s, this means that they have a lot of amazing dishes to choose from!

My husband and I were &#34;hungry ordering&#34;, which can be pretty dangerous!  In this case, it meant order $41 worth of food for the two of us (whoops!!).  But at least we had delicious leftovers!!

OK, here&#39;s what we got:
**Mini Panzerotti
**Homemade Mini Arancini (4)
**Risotto Al Funghi &amp; Pollo (Italian rice w/sauteed w/portobello mushrooms and chicken)--Comes w/ soup or salad
**Cavatelli Alfredo (Homemade fresh pasta tossed in alfredo sauce with mushrooms, spinach &amp; broccoli)--Comes w/ Soup or salad
**Pepper and Egg Sandwich

Sooooo, now after I see all of that typed out, I can see why they gave us enough condiments/utensils for a family of five.  Meh, oh well!

OK, so everything was REALLY good (the first AND the second day) for everything except for the Pepper and Egg Sandwich--my husband thought that was a bit too greasy and didn&#39;t even finish it all :(

But the pasta tasted homemade for sure, right down to the sauce and especially the noodles.  The Mini Panzerottis were really good and well-seasoned!  the Arancini is in a class all by itself.  These were SO good inside and out.

Honestly, though, my favorite was the Risotto with the Arancini coming in close second.  My risotto was made of happy tears and unicorn glitter, FOR SHIZ.  I cannot believe how good this was.  They had some other different kinds for me to try, but the mushroom/chicken one that I ordered is what dreams are made of!

This chef really knows what they&#39;re doing, and they have the right customer service to match!!  I will definitely be back again, and SOON!


The only thing that keeps them from being a five-star review is that they forgot our free pizza for ordering over $20 worth of food.  But it was free, so I didn&#39;t call and say anything.  But my husband was disappointed because that was going to be part of his meal :("

We had delivery-the person who delivered the pizza firstly was the nicest delivery person...very friendly a lot of thanks and have a nice day....

We had a half and half pizza one side veggies for me and meat for my friend all the ingredients were fresh and delicious and the crust was very crispy without being burnt.  Then I tried the Panzerotti it is a wonderful pocket of deliciousness with tomato sauce and delicious cheese inside a little puff... (I would highly reccomend trying this its a great little apitizer to split)....there is something about the freshness of the ingredients that makes the food at this pizza place wonderful.

We ordered a large Pizza Margarita to go. Their thin crust pizza is good - something I&#39;d order again, and particularly because the vegetables used were bright and fresh. 

You can&#39;t really hide behind anything in a Margarita; it&#39;s basil, tomatoes, garlic and mozzarella, with some cheese. So I thought it wasn&#39;t the best thin crust pizza I&#39;ve ever had, but definitely worth going back for.

Ah, but the arancini. This was excellent. For whatever reason a description isn&#39;t provided on the website, so I&#39;ll describe it as: medium-sized balls of cheese, rice and peas, battered and then deep fried. It&#39;s served with a fresh tomato salsa.

The arancini was perfect. Crunchy on the outside, creamy on the inside, still hot when I got home. I think Chef Vincenzo knows what he&#39;s doing.

Can&#39;t wait to go back and try other appetizers! They seem to have a surprisingly strong seafood side of the menu, so perhaps the Insalade di Mare will be next?"

My mozzarella sticks were forgotten for my lunch delivery yesterday, and when I called back to inform them they offered either a credit or to bring them. I asked for them to be delivered,  they showed up before my break was even over and to top it off he gave me like 20 sticks and a apology written on the box! You dont get service like this anywhere else. While on the topic of service,  I asked for two pizza slices on a large delivery (about $70.00) at lunch and when the driver showed up he said they didnt know if they would sell out of slices so chef made me a whole pizza!!!  highly recommend this place.

When you walk in there&#39;s a rotating pizza pan heated with slices for sale along with paper copies of the menu&#39;s. In visiting Pietanza&#39;s Pizzeria I decided to try Lasagna, I also purchased several slices of pizza for myself and co-workers to try. 

The first item to go over is the Lasagna, the Lasagna is made with fresh noodles, flavorful cheese and lots of beef and sausage. The tomato sauce used is a little on the thin side but provides a nice flavor. For the price (around 11.00 + tax) this was definitely a lot of food and came with soup and bread. The lasagna tasted even better than it looked and overall I was very impressed by the texture, flavor and price of the meal. I&#39;d recommend it.

I also had the opportunity to try a little of their pizza. This was one of the individual slices and was a medium thickness crust. The crust was tasty, the sauce was sweet and but not too excessively applied and the quality of the cheese was excellent. This was bolstered  by the fact that there is a 1.00 pizza slice special on Mondays, which happens to be the day that I visited. While this wasn&#39;t the best pizza in the world, for the price I can&#39;t complain.

Overall I liked Pietanza&#39;s Pizzeria and will definitely return again. I thought my pasta dish (the Lasagna) was a bit better than their pizza and would recommend it to anyone with a craving for Garfield&#39;s favorite dish."

We each also added a side to our sandwiches for only $1.19 ea... (decent portions / great value) awesome deep fried mushrooms, very good fried zucchini and good roasted potatoes.

This place is really just not great. $33 later and regretting it. I ordered from grub hub and I noticed I forgot a side of a sauce I wanted to I immediately called as I put in my order to add it and the kid answered and told me sure we can add that s s he asked me to hang on and he put the phone down then I hear what I assume was his boss or manager in the background very meanly ask &#34;what&#39;s the problem!?&#34; And he said nothing she just wants a side of sour cream and then I hear this guy just yelling all furiously over it and the kid picks up the phone and is like &#34;yes we can add that in there for you&#34; I was just like okay..... And said thank you and he hung up. 

I&#39;m sorry but what the hell was his bosses issue? He sounded like a raging lunatic. 

So my food arrives, the delivery guy was very nice and soft spoken so I know it wasn&#39;t the asshole I heard over the phone. When I got my food my pizza was burnt, there wasn&#39;t much topping, and tasted pretty basic. The chicken wings were dry and not very appetizing and Luke warm. And the &#34;thick cut&#34; onion rings were more like thickly breaded normal cut onion rings. It tasted way too battered, and they were sweet which was gross I like my onion rings savory not sweet, I ended up throwing them away. Overall pretty disappointing dint waste your energy or money in this place. We&#39;re in one if the best states for good pizza, literally anywhere would be better than here."

If you desire a giant slice of pie with a robust flavor...keep looking.  If your looking for something generic to tame the growl in your belly, this is just enough to get you by.

A pizza slice from Adamo&#39;s is relatively small by comparison. however they make up for the volume with a &#34;Double Dough&#34; pizza crust. This is not a heavy pizza loaded with cheese, sausage, pepperoni, sauce or flavor, it&#39;s &#34;Double Dough&#34; and double trouble.

They offer two slices for a lunch special...&#34;careful&#34;. eating more than one slice may spoil your supper."

We decided last night would be a good mini celebration to get some pizza on a Friday night. So, of course, we Yelped up some potential opportunities for our pizza exploration. 

This place is super close to us so we decided we&#39;d give it a try. $32.00 later, we were left unimpressed. 

We did a pepperoni, banana pepper, and jalape√±o pizza, with loaded baked potatoes skins, and we got this intro to their &#34;club&#34; special of garlic bread and a free 2 liter of soda. We don&#39;t drink soda so eh to that, the garlic bread wasn&#39;t bad, and the loaded baked potatoes were decent (nothing really to brag about).

The pizza...gosh I don&#39;t know what people see in it. It was okay, not terrible, but definitely not what I was expecting from the reviews. Everything about it was just bland...there was no flavor. The only thing that had any taste was the jalapenos. Other than that, it tasty like crunchy blandness. 

The club deal is decent - you get 1 point per order and after 10 points/orders, you can get a free pizza. The delivery was okay - was expecting it to be a bit faster seeing as in we&#39;re only 3 blocks away (still took about an hour to get our food). 

Otherwise, I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be ordering again. It wasn&#39;t terrible, but the price was not ideal for the quality. If it was cheaper, we might suck it up and order from here again just for pure convenience."

Knowin&#39; the other half wouldn&#39;t be home until at least 10, I figured now was the time to try that Taco Fresco pizza.

So I hopped onto good ol&#39; Grubhub, and began my order. I went with a medium Taco Fresco pizza (thin crust) with a side of hot sauce. Since you need a $20 minimum for delivery, I threw in an order of Spicy fries (w/a side of hot sauce, too) and a 24 oz bottle of Sierra Mist (I don&#39;t drink pop anymore, but I needed something to tip the scales over $20).

Satisfied, I submitted my order. It was 5:13 p.m. They estimated my delivery time for about an hour (&#34;6:14-ish&#34;, said Grubhub). Low and behold, my doorbell rang at 5:45, and I was shocked. I honestly was expecting the hour they said (Route 59 construction + rush hour traffice= nightmare). The delivery guy even charged up the stairs like a bull to get me my food. Talk about enthusiasm! He was extremely friendly too; repeated my entire order back to make sure it was correct, which it was (right down to the extra hot sauces, and no silverware needed). Alas, it was time to eat.

The Spicy Fries looked and smelled good. After tasting one, I was totally surprised. I can handle spicy food like no one&#39;s business, but my god! These things were on FIRE! And I LIKED IT! Finally, someone calling their product &#34;spicy&#34; and truly living up to the name. Well done!

Pizza looked perfect, and smelled delicious! I was a bit hesitant after reading all the reviews about the bland sauce. However, I think if you&#39;re a Plain Jane pizza fan (cheese only, 1/2 cheese and 1/2 sausage, etc) then yeah, it might seem bland to you. My taco pizza was fabulous; obviously there were so many other flavors going on (dorito chips, black olives, hot peppers, onion, tomato chunks, and seasoned ground beef) that I didn&#39;t even notice the sauce. 

Overall, not bad."

I found out about them via their advertisements/coupon left at our door. I was extremely hesitant to trying their food because of the reviews; however, I did notice in the negative reviews that no one complained about the pizza- they either complained about their personal experience with the service or with the non-pizza food items. They all still admitted the pizza was good. So I decided to give it a go.

I ordered a large thin crust sausage and a large thin crust pizza. Both were surprisingly really good! The pizza had a lot of flavor and yummy cheese. The person I spoke to on the phone was also super friendly and patient and when I went to pick up the pizza, he remembered who I was from the phone call and nicely smiled at me and was very friendly.

I will definitely order from here again next time I&#39;m craving pizza! I want to try pan or whatever other styles they offer."

This is some of the best pizza I have found. You can tell that Adamo&#39;s uses high quality ingredients, especially the cheese. My absolute favorite pizza is the Florentine. The calzones are delicious too. I work close by and will oftentimes order lunch from Adamo&#39;s as well. The Godmother sandwich and the chicken Caesar salad are both solid choices.

Having been to Adamo&#39;s as many times as I have, I can say that I have always received top-notch service. Eddie, the owner, genuinely cares about his customers. He made it a point early on to remember my name, which is such a rare gesture these days.

I ordered the thin crust sausage pizza and LOVED it! Don&#39;t understand why people might have called the sauce tasteless. Just a hint of sweetness to balance the delicious saltiness of the cheese! Real mozzarella cheese, too, more reminiscent of giordano&#39;s than the lesser quality stuff used at say domino&#39;s or papa john&#39;s. Tried the cheese bread, and it was just ok (maybe would be better piping hot at the restaurant?) same with mozz sticks. The cannoli was delicious!!!
Most importantly, the price was great, and it got to our house in about 30 minutes!
I think this will be my new go-to pizza place from now on! (At least until Jan 1st when I swear off all carbs, cheese, sugar and anything yummy in general :)

This is the worse pizza I&#39;ve ever had anywhere in the country. Worse than cities that don&#39;t even claim to have a good pizza! Worse than all of the commercialized pizza chains! Surely the kind of stuff you&#39;d find at a 4 year old kid&#39;s pizza party.

I&#39;m only writing this as constructive criticism and in hopes that Adamo&#39;s considers stepping up their game. After moving just a few blocks away from Adamo&#39;s 7 months ago, I finally broke down and tried it. From being in the restaurant industry as a chef, exec manager, corp manager and consultant for 27 years, I have the talent of gauging most restaurants accurately, and this is why I stayed away from this place. 

I ordered a large pizza and 6 wings. The only thing that I finished and kept was the free Pepsi. That Pepsi was GREAT! I can tell that they are using the lowest quality of ingredients probably purchased from Restaurant Depot (the Aldi for the restaurant industry.) 

The dough was over proofed and gummy, the sauce was like a glorified ketchup and seemed to be straight from the can; the cheese seemed to be a part skim blend and wasn&#39;t fully melted. The wings were breaded and anorexic, and the ranch dressing was surely a very low grade. The marinara that came with the free garlic bread was right out of the can and tasted like tomato paste with water added to it and maybe...a few spices. 

I&#39;m usually right about places like this, but I  still ordered and was in a great mood and had no expectations and realized afterwards that I should&#39;ve gone with my first impression. I do have to say that the delivery guy was very nice and thankful; the website was very easy to use and convenient for ordering. But the product is by far VERY poor. 

As a consultant, I see why they have been in business since 1988, it&#39;s not because they have an outstanding product. It&#39;s because they are located on a very busy street, near more than a dozen apartment complexes populated with individuals that range mostly in their 20&#39;s. There&#39;s no competition for them for quite a few miles. So, they really don&#39;t have to change anything, right? The 20 year old crowd will continue to support Adamo&#39;s inferior products because it&#39;s convenient and they probably just don&#39;t care!  

You heard it here first! As soon as another Pizza restaurant hits this area, Adamo&#39;s will be done if they don&#39;t change! I&#39;ve seen it happen over and over and over in the restaurant industry. Take this review as a free consultation Adamo&#39;s and please don&#39;t be angered by it. You won&#39;t be able to keep operating the way that you have been. You&#39;re running on borrowed time. (Hint: take note of the complex next door to you.)"

My impression: pizza is better than Pizza Hut or Domino&#39;s, but not as good as places like Lou Malnati&#39;s.  

Pricing is right where it should be. 

This is a small place which seems like it is mainly used by people who order for carry out or delivery, but there is a small area inside where you could eat if you wanted.  The decor of the indoor area is decent.  

The service was about what you would expect this kind of in and out place.  Staff was nice, but the interaction with them is short and simple.

Overall a good place to get a decent pizza with out spending top dollar."

The side salad had bits of slimy rotten lettuce and the meat sauce was filled with undercooked onions.   I had to pick them out one by one.   I don&#39;t know if I can get past that.

This pizza tastes so much like a Pizza Hut pizza; I think they probably get pre-made dough from their supplier since it lacks that yeast dough flavor great pizzas have. The price is ok I guess for the area but the pizza is mediocre and I&#39;m sure there are better places out there. I chose this place based on the Yelp reviews and so that is why I am writing a review to try and warn others.

The prices are great, and the owner and staff go out of their way to be friendly, helpful, and polite.

The bad thing is that the pizza is less than good...I really wish they&#39;d season the dough or sauce...or something. Anything, really. It just kind of tastes bland. But, hey, what do you expect. At Adamos, you def. get what you pay for so if you want a quick and cheap slice for lunch, go here."

Momma and I came through here to grab a quick bite/glass of wine before my train. We let the hostess know that we were on a time crunch and she was sweet to hurry us to a table and alert our server that we were in a bit of a hurry. (Unfortunately, I think our server forgot that we were in a time crunch, as he didn&#39;t come back to take our food order for awhile after he brought us our drinks.). 

We split the ravioli and the caprese salad. You really can&#39;t mess up a caprese salad...standard deliciousness. The ravioli was nothing to write home about. Pretty normal, sauce was fine but not great, ravioli tasted like ravioli I&#39;m used to eating from the store. I requested for it to come with extra sauce (because I like a little bit of pasta with my red sauce) and I&#39;m glad I did, otherwise I don&#39;t think we&#39;d have enough to cover the noodles. 

I wouldn&#39;t rank this much of a place to sit down and have a nice dinner, but I&#39;d say that it was great for a casual, quick dinnersnack before I headed back to the city. Unfortunately, when we were wanting the check, our server was nowhere to be found. Momma ended up going to the bathroom and asking him for the check on her way. 

We&#39;d likely come here again because the hostess was so sweet, and we know they&#39;re capable of a quick Italian meal if you&#39;re in a crunch...just make sure to keep your server on top of his game."

We ordered:
 tortellini Alfredo - flavorful and good, chicken parmigiana - average with a little more garlic than we are used to but good. linguini broccoli and shrimp with garlic oil sauce - 6 jumbo shrimp and plenty of pasta really good.

The space is large with wooden tables and a long bar.  The front opens to the street with large doors.  The menu is written on a chalkboard and they offer a few specials of the day.  Their wine list by the glass is so-so and their food is typical Italian fare.  Nothing bad, but just okay.  This 100% Italian used to love their fish salad...the best around outshining Caputo&#39;s.  My husband would even stop to carry out for me because I loved it.  Unfortunately, this time it was lacking.  The calamari was plentiful and it still had the one shrimp plopped on top, but they added avocado.  Really?  And the sauce wasn&#39;t as good of a thickened lemon olive oil sauce as in the two previous visits where I used to dip my bread in at the end of the bowl.  That was part of the experience I enjoyed about eating this dish.  The caprese salad is very good, as is the Italian bread served with either butter or olive oil and parmesan cheese.  Our service, Sabrina, was very friendly and attentive.  She provided good service.  All in all, if I want a fantastic Italian meal, I would go to Capri in Burr Ridge or La Bella Pasteria in Oak Park.  This is just okay and didn&#39;t wow me."

Inside the restaurant is very open, with a large bar and tasteful, rustic decor. For a party such as a surprise bday or shower, they allowed the people running it to do whatever they wanted with extra decorations, seating arrangements, etc. 
Food was great! I really liked the salad (one with the meats, cheeses, olives, etc) and the cavatappi with the vodka sauce.

Gatto&#39;s is a comfortable old school Italian restaurant.. it&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve been to the one in Downers Grove, we really enjoyed the one in Tinley Park when we were there several years ago. Once again, Lisa and I were were dining with our besties; Adam and Janet (discerning foodies and dining experience buffs)

I like that they aren&#39;t trying to be just another white table cloth Italian place (see the two down the street). It&#39;s a warm, inviting atmosphere... we were there on probably the first great night of weather this year and they opened up the whole front of the place (we were in the opened window area)  for a perfect al fresco experience.

4 appetizers, 4 entrees, sides, 1 garbage salad to share, multiple beers, sodas, bottle of Rutherford Hill Merlot and after dinner drinks (including Sambuca) A total bill under $200 Oh, and coffee.

The Gatto&#39;s were in the house and Frank stopped by to visit with us for a while.. It was nice (smart) of him to do.. he was there having dinner with his family.. it was almost like we were having dinner at his house.

For appetizers we shared: fried zucchini (Frank style.. extra thin), sausage and peppers (they cut it up for us to make it easier to share) perch limon (yummy) and stuffed mushrooms which were disgusting to nobody but me. (I hate mushrooms to my very core so I didn&#39;t try them)

Adam and Janet both got the Cowboy Steaks (16 oz bone in rib eyes) and they both made substitutions on the sides (no problem). Their steaks were done perfectly and a great deal for a full meal at $24.95 each.

Lisa and I were jonesing for some pasta.. Lisa had the Eggplant Parmigiana (delicious, and had plenty of leftovers) I displayed my usual lack of self control, and ordered Spaghetti Bolognese with a meatball on the side AND a sausage on the side.. took one look at all the food that I ordered and said out loud &#34;uh oh&#34;. Then proceeded to eat every bite..... 

Our waiter was on top of things and we really enjoyed ourselves.  We tipped him well because we hogged that table for a good 3 hours on a Saturday night and never once felt rushed.

Street parking was a breeze and we enjoyed a nice walk around DG afterwards.. the little popcorn shop across the street was an added bonus."

We walk in, the place reeks of fish but was willing to overlook that. We sit in the dining room and the windows were open which was nice and we had a great table. Our silverware was disgusting (can&#39;t imagine what the back of the house looks like). The wine deals they advertise are for the bar only, great. We order, prices are average to maybe slightly high for the type of food and &#34;low rent&#34; restaurant. Our food could hardly be considered average, expect olive garden quality. I had the worst chicken parm I&#39;ve ever ordered, I&#39;m not sure how this dish can be messed up. My girlfriends pasta dish was average at best.
Then the owner had a guy working on the building/windows during business hours which ruined the only nice thing about this place which is the street level atmosphere/view. I will not be returning, if this place didn&#39;t have the convenient in town location they would have been out of business a long time ago."

We were seated quickly on this Friday afternoon (around 5:30).  The &#34;menu&#34; is up on a chalkboard - one-liners displaying the selections.  A plastic menu card with one-liners was put onto the table as well.  Great?  Not really.  To see what accompanies each selection you need to look at the outstanding Gatto&#39;s Web site or ask the server.  I think the server would get very, very tired of describing each, and I mean each, selection on the menu.  A full menu with descriptions is more suitable.

I ordered the spaghetti and some meatballs,  My wife ordered lasagna.  Bread and butter  is put on the table as soon as you sit down.  We got a second serving of the &#34;standard&#34; bread when the food got to the table without any bread accompanying it.  I guess I should have asked for some garlic bread.  I settled for the default bread, which was good ... not warm, but good.

The default  spaghetti sauce was just okay, maybe a bit on the bland side.  The meatballs, on the other hand, were very good.  I should have skipped the spaghetti and just ordered a few meatballs ... but I did have a taste for spaghetti.  My wife&#39;s spaghetti is far superior to Gatto&#39;s.  I should know better than to order spaghetti when we go out to dinner.

My wife&#39;s lasagna was just so-so with I think the same sauce.  She compared the lasagna to those she orders from the relatively nearby Home Run Inn and Carraba&#39;s.  She says that those are much better than the lasagna at Gatto;s.

So ... will we come back?  Because of the good prices, friendly service and comfortable seating, yes, but not for any pasta dishes.  I guess &#34;Italian&#34; is subjective term. The restaurant didn&#39;t seem that &#34;Italian.&#34;  We will also look at the Web site in advance to decide on a food selection."

The choices/selection were outstanding for both adults and kids.  Kids meals for $5, yes please!  My salmon was cooked to absolute perfection where it truly melted in my mouth.  My husband&#39;s shrimp linguine was delish and the kids were actually quiet b/c they were loving their pasta..with a giant meatball.

The prices were very reasonable, service excellent, great ambiance and delicious food.  What more could a family of 5 ask for? :)"

Highly recommend the garbage salad as well as linguine with broccoli and shrimp. Oh...and the Tiramisu....TO DIE FOR!!! My guests were blown away at how amazing the food was. The service was top notch as well. This is a perfect place for a celebration!!! Brittany the manager makes this place especially inviting and warm.

Portions are generous enough to share with a companion. By far, our favorite time to go is a weeknight when we can sit at the bar; same great food, even better service.

We then found out he was the owner, and when was stayed for a round as a thank you to him and his staff, they pulled out ALL the stops.  He gave us appetizers, a couple more shots, and friendly, accommodating service!

The owner here is not only a VERY smart businessman (20 girls will surely keep this place in mind next time they&#39;re in Downers) but a very friendly and welcoming person.

This place seems to be a town favorite, especially on the weekends and it&#39;s not that large so be sure to either get there a little early or arrange for reservations. It&#39;s decorated charmingly but doesn&#39;t require you to dress fancy. It has a very relaxed atmosphere and is pretty much right in the heart of downtown Downers Grove. 
We orded an appetizer and some pasta. I have had a lot of calamari but nothing compares to the calamari here. We asked for it grilled instead of fried and they drizzled some sort of sauce on it. We got plenty of it and it was those little pieces with the rings and the tentacles. It was the best tasting calamari--probably the best tasting appetizer--I have ever had. I would go back just for that. 
I ordered the Porcini Ravioli. It was rich, creamy, and just perfect. It was amazing and even the leftovers were great. 
Overall, the food is simply perfect and fantastic. Even the parm on the table for the bread was better than your average italian restaurant. Seriously, try the calamari. Enjoy the food."

It was the first stop on our map for our Pub Crawl for Misericordia. They offered $3 glasses of wine and half price apps and salads for the specials. We opted for the fried zucchini and bruchetta. Probably the BEST and sadly, the worse options on their menu. Their Bruchetta was pretty good. A lot of tomatoes and onions and minimal cheese, but perfectly seasoned and served on very nicely toasted bread. The fried zucchini left much to be desired. It was just frozen patties of zucchini breaded and fried. They were mushy and kinda gross. Probably would do them some good to take them off their menu or think about improving how they are prepared. Maybe think about making it fresh in house?? Just a thought.

The service was impeccable. Brian served our table and he was on top of it!! A shout out to Brian!! The bus-ers swept their way through the restaurant, clearing dirty dishes, glasses and tables. They obviously work hard.

My fiance and I plan to return soon to eat dinner or lunch on a weekend.  I really want to try them out for a full meal because from what I saw our family eating, the food looked great.

I hope to write an update soon with my dinner experience.

Enjoy!"

Do yourself a favor and give it a try. Absolutely delicious. Also, be sure to make a reservation on the weekend.

Seated quickly, and yes there is a chalk board menu, it is the same as the printed menu left at our table. We ordered something not on the menu and not a special, no problem. 

The bread was served hot and was not too crusty. Our salads were fine and our entrees were good. 

However, why is there an up charge for Vodka sauce? That was new to me and it had an unusual taste to it.

It is very family friendly and our service was fine.  Kind of cold next to the large glass doors that I am assuming they open during specific times of the year.

Summary:  okay food, fine service, family friendly, but beware of hidden charges."

Average calamari.  Nothing special other than a nice-size portion.

Braciole - meh.  Tasted good, but portion was miniscule and over-priced.  Basically a giant plate of undersauced pasta with a couple small slices of braciole. 

Shells and broccoli were good, but way too expensive given what goes into it.  

Wine had a MASSIVE mark-up...close to 6x on the cheapest bottle.  

For wine, go across the street to the Cellar Door.  For italian, there are 100s of other places to choose from."

I thought this place was pretty good. The restaurant wasn&#39;t very busy at all, and aside from one other table, we were the only people in there. Not sure if it&#39;s more of a dinner place, but that could have been why. 

The food was really good - and the service was prompt. The only difficult thing was the menu. It was written on a chalkboard up on the wall (I had been waiting for a menu before I realized it was right on the wall above me.) I have some food allergies and diet limitations, so without seeing a description of each menu item, it was a little difficult deciding what to get. Other than that, the house salad was really good, minestrone soup was great, and the linguine with oil and garlic was delicious. They seemed to have a great appetizer menu, so I would recommend this place for lunch, dinner, or happy hour with a glass of wine and some appetizers!"

But the best part: during the National Anthem when they dim the lights at the stadium, they dimmed all of the lights in the restaurant!  Food was very good.  The bruschetta was some of the best I have ever had.  Calamari cooked perfectly.  Gigantic shrimp in a pasta dish with clearly fresh broccoli..  Chicken Vesuvio was great.  It was chicken parts, not typically dry breasts.  Meatballs were good and pasta well cooked, but the tomato sauce average.  Cannoli were fresh and crispy. One issue : the olives in a very good garbage salad had pits. Not good unless you are a dentist."

Ray is an awesome bartender, and is a fun person to chat with.  He makes great drinks, and is just a nice guy.

15 minutes for a server to stop by and say hello - placed full order at this point, 
15 minutes to come back with the drinks (1 water, 1 beer and 1 milk for son)
47 minutes from order placement time until food arrived stone cold, not warm - cold
10 minutes to find manager to discuss food quality and temperature - his response after he stopped chatting to the bartender: &#34;that&#39;s just the way it is.  If you don&#39;t like it, don&#39;t eat here.&#34;

I found the marinara to be rather bland with a slight ketchup flavor.  The vodka sauce had a pool of what appeared to be grease sitting on top of it and had a flavor to match.  The meals were left mainly unfinished except for the two or three bites taken so perhaps my sample size was too small but I couldn&#39;t take another bite.

I&#39;ve been to their other location in Tinley and remembered it being good, so after we were told it would be a 45 min wait at another restaurant across the tracks we trekked over to Gatto&#39;s to see if they could accommodate our party of 5. We were seated immediately. The manager even gave us a table that had been marked as reserved, which the other restaurant was not willing to do. I get having to accommodate your reservations, but a good restaurant mgr also knows how to juggle tables to accommodate both reservations and walk ins, just sayin. Anyhoo, I thought the menus were very vague at first, not having any descriptions of dishes, but our waitress was very knowledgable and friendly, so that was not an issue. I didn&#39;t think the prices were out of the ordinary, pretty standard for a family friendly Italian place. My sister in law and I both got wine. The glasses ranged from $7-$9 a glass. I had a taste for a spicy red sauce and the waitress recommended the arabiatta sauce. My husband, bro-in-law and myself all ordered it, and we all loved it. My husband and I also got their homemade cavatappi pasta and it was delicious. Bro in law got regular mostaccoli and was happy with it. My husband got sausage in his dish and was somewhat underwhelmed, but said it was because he just ate my moms homemade sausage earlier. Lol! So, unfair comparison. I had shrimp and it was very fresh. We were all very happy with our  dishes. The desert was the best part though, they have a cinnamon gelato that is fantastic! My husband got a homemade cannoli and it was awesome too.

Getting parking near Gatto&#39;s wasn&#39;t particularly easy, and I ended up parking in a commuter lot near Tivoli, not the greatest location when I already was late and in a rush.  I really enjoyed the atmosphere, with very high ceilings, unfinished brick wall and just a great feel for the summer, with the doors open to Main St.  The place is big, and based on the half full room when I dined, I could definitely see this getting pretty darn loud at capacity.

My table split an order of bruschetta, which was tasty but way too much material piled onto the bread.  I had bowties and sausage, which seemed to get a bit boring after about a third of the way in, with the only flavors really being garlic and butter.

The prices here are pretty good, and I would be fine coming back again if I was in downtown DG, but I seriously doubt this will be memorable enough for me to suggest coming back myself."

Fried zucchini was quite good and I&#39;m not big on fried vegetables, and the bread was crusty and warm.  angel hair with broccoli and stuffed shells were both just what I was hoping for, flavorful!  I heard to bartender telling a local foodie that they make all their own sauces and dressings, a big plus in my book.  Decent beer and wine selection.  The bartender could have been more attentive.

The portions are decent and although the service is kind of slow, I like the ambiance of the place.  The owners are always there too which is nice to know they care."

The chicken Milano is to die for! When I order it I always add a bed of angel hair pasta as I think it finishes off the plate nicely. 

For the amount of food you get, you cannot beat the prices. The only thing I don&#39;t like, it gets pretty noisy

This is my favorite local restaurant if I&#39;m in the mood for Italian food."

It was crowded but we were seated fast. Looking good.

Where&#39;s the menu? Oh, it&#39;s written in chalk on the chalkboard on the wall, about 30 feet away. What is this, a deli? 

Then the food arrives. I played it safe and got spaghetti and meatballs. Not awful, but not anything special. Maybe in between Olive Garden and Buca di Beppo. So actually sort of bad. 

I did have a taste of my friend&#39;s veal, which was served with peas and looked like airplane food. The meat was terrible. I wish Michael Douglas was there to describe it like he did the burger in the movie &#34;Falling Down:&#34;     &#34;Look at this sorry, miserable, squashed thing. Can anybody tell me what&#39;s wrong with this picture?&#34;

We had a party of 8-10 people, and no one liked the food. 

I won&#39;t be going back, unless it&#39;s to possibly drink at the bar. The food was sub Olive Garden on the dishes that counted."

The service was terrible. During the course of the meal, I may have seen the waitress for 1 minute. She never introduced herself and just did what I call &#34;drive-by&#34; orders. McDonald&#39;s has better customer service.

Then the food. I ordered the &#34;bow-tie and sausage&#34; and it tasted like they forgot something. It was simply dry undercooked pasta with ground sausage sprinkled on top. I would have rather stayed home and made Hamburger Helper with my girlfriend....it would have saved me money.

At the end the waitress explained the poor service as a result of &#34;it being crazy busy.&#34; This can be explained by one of two things:
- You have too many tables at your location. or 
- You have too few staff.

Neither of which are my problems.

Avoid this joint. Downers Grove has so many better options."

It wasn&#39;t offensively horrible and I didn&#39;t spit out my food or anything, but for the expectations I came in with based on the price of the food and the amount of people waiting for tables, I was decidedly underwhelmed. 

When I went, the restaurant had no print menus, but rather expected everyone to read its offerings off dusty blackboards. That concept works OK sometimes when the boards are in clear view, but that was not the case here and several patrons had to stand under the boards to read what was available (awkwardly forcing people to stand beside a table of diners, intruding upon their meals, mind you).

Nothing on said blackboards sounded particularly appealing to me (maybe because I couldn&#39;t read them well), so based on the waitress&#39; recommendation, I ordered some sort of linguine with oil and garlic. It came out as just a pile of pasta drowning in a high pool of oil mixed with gigantic, almost-whole cloves of garlic. Not good.

The service wasn&#39;t superb either. In fact, the waitress seemed genuinely put out whenever we asked her for more bread or to refill our water glasses -- which, side note, were the smallest glasses I&#39;ve ever seen, and thus perpetually empty and in need of refills, which rarely came. When we asked her if it was possible to split the check, I genuinely thought her head might explode. Having been a waitress, I know that&#39;s not ideal, but c&#39;mon, it&#39;s not THAT hard.

I went last winter, on what I believe was one of the restaurant&#39;s first weekends up and running, so maybe they&#39;ve worked out some of their kinks and improved since then. I&#39;m always rooting for new restaurants to succeed, but still ... for the amount I paid and mediocrity I experienced, I won&#39;t be going back."

Its within walking distance of my house, yet I didn&#39;t even notice that it had opened.  While we waited we had a drink at the bar, the bartender was very friendly, and we asked if we could have a table in the open windows if one became available. She and the GM swung by and said no problem.  They must have held the table for a good 1/2 hour, which is amazing to me for a warm spring night when other patrons must have been asking for that specific table, so kudos for the customer service on that!  

When we finally got seated it did take a while to get our waiter to come over and get our friends their drinks.  When those were dropped off we did ask for suggestions on the menu, and he gave a few.  I must say mine was the most flavorful-the chicken carmine was outstanding!  Everything else was good (the veal marsala was a little bland though)  and the portions were huge!  For the 4 of us including alcohol (bottle of wine, plus beers for the guys)  came to $120.  Not inexpensive by anymeans, but still a good meal and fun experience."

I saw children(the owners?) running around, behind the bar, getting their own ice &amp; drinks(filling up her soda using the gun, letting the gun be completely submerged in her drink), touching 15 straws before picking &#34;the right one.&#34; I saw servers making themselves vodka cranberries &amp; drinking them. I saw servers picking up a used napkin/kleenex off the floor &amp; then using the same hand to get a straw for a drink. It was all in all a little disturbing. I admit, I am a germaphobe, so maybe my senses are heightened, but still. It was gross. Yes the staff seemed friendly &amp; fun, maybe a little intoxicated?

While parking can be a little tough during the week, it is nothing compared to the city. Once you are inside, you will find a clean Restaurant that has done an EXCELLENT job restoring the space to its exposed brisk walls, and hardwood beans and ceiling. 

They have an expansive menu, but of the different dishes that we&#39;ve ordered all have been good. Chicken Vesuvio, Chicken Parm, and my favorite is their Minestrone Soup. The warm bread that they bring you while waiting is worth noting as well.

We walked in and saw a packed dining room and things were looking good. We had to have a drink at the bar before a table opened up.  2 beers and 2 mixed drinks for $18.  Not bad at all. We got seated by a host who seemed to be very confused.  Each time he went to seat a party, he had no idea who was who and went around and asked everyone who they were. 

At the table, we excitedly picked what we were having.  The waitress arrives in very casual dress.  My wife&#39;s dish is not available.  My friend&#39;s dish is also not available. We were 50% on even being able to order what we wanted- items they had written on the specials board.  How about erasing it if you have no more to sell?

When the food came, I felt like I was at Fazoli&#39;s.  It was terrible. The sauces were weak, bland and lacking in all aspects.  I envision the kitchen as a giant hot table, with the 6 sauces that come out of bags heating, and the 8 pastas boiling.  Order comes in and scoop, scoop- its out the window.   My tortellini dish was $12, not too bad, but for what I got, not worth it.  My bowl had a portion of cheese tortellini with way too much bland alfredo sauce.  No veggies, no meats, just a sprinkle of something green for color.  I used to make this dish at the party house in college. 

I don&#39;t recommend the food here. The atmosphere was vibrant. The bar was priced reasonably. They managed to fazoli a great location."

We had a drink at the bar before being seated and enjoyed a &#34;family-style&#34; meal where we ordered several appetizers, entrees and desserts and then shared.  The service at the bar was quick and friendly despite it being a very busy night at the restaurant.  The mixed drinks were potent and perfect and the beer was cold.  The service at the table was also very attentive and friendly.  The server was very helpful in guiding us to the right dishes to order to make it easy to share and correctly suggested the number of dishes to order for the group.  The food arrived quickly, was hot, tasted very good, and was of a high quality.  Serving sizes were about average, perfect for sharing. If individual entrees had been ordered I suspect several of us would have been carrying food home.  The desserts were excellent and a good way to cap an enjoyable experience.  The menu at Gatto&#39;s is on chalkboards on several walls of the restaurant. We observed later that there are printed menus but you have to ask for them I guess.  We like printed menus and would have asked had we known. The only hassle we had was finding parking. Downers Grove hosts a car show every Friday night in summer that eats up all of the best downtown parking. We managed to snag one of the last spots in the free public parking deck two blocks away.

You dollars are better spent at Clara&#39;s, Carabas or even the Olive Garden.  In downtown Downers Grove take the time to walk 200 ft. down the street to get great Italain food at Capri.

I was in awe--a large 14-inch pizza with one topping is only $7.99 plus tax. The guy told me it would be ready in 8 minutes, and he wasn&#39;t kidding--I timed it, and it was exactly 8 minutes. Took my pizza home and dived right in. The thin crust, tomato sauce and cheesy-ness satisfied my hunger. I agree with the other Yelpers that say--it may not be the best pizza in the world, but it sure isn&#39;t the worst either. 

So, you ask, &#34;If it isn&#39;t the best pizza, why should I try it?&#34; Here&#39;s why... 
A large 14&#34; pizza with one topping is $7.99 plus tax !!!
... and it only takes 8 minutes to bake in the oven !!! 

Good Pizza + Good Price = Great Value.

The TASTE is BETTER than Pizza Hut, Papa John&#39;s, Little Ceasar, etc. 
The PRICE is LESS than Giordanos, Nancys, etc.

If you are stricken with hunger and a craving for pizza, and want instant gratification, Papa Fresco&#39;s will do :)

Papa Fresco&#39;s is also good if you work nearby and have a one-hour lunch break. The pizza is baked quickly, and they have a half-dozen or more tables so you can eat lunch there.

Per their sign (see photos) they offer Par-Baked Pizzas and Gluten-Free Crusts. I also uploaded a photo with current menu prices (the existing photo from another user has outdated prices)."

They had a coupon where you got a large one topping pizza,  10 chicken wings, and a 2 liter for $17.99.  The crust was extremely flavorful, the sauce and the cheese was perfectly cooked on the pizza. The chicken wings were really good for a pizza place. My only suggestion would to make sure you order more than you normally order from other pizza places because their pizzas are so thin and you are going to want more as you eat the pizza. When you walk into this place, don&#39;t expect much environment because it&#39;s a very basic store and they have a couple chairs for people to sit and eat. If you are looking for a quick pizza place, that&#39;s isn&#39;t expensive, and really tasty, I would recommend this restaurant."

If you answered yes to any of these questions than Papa Fresco&#39;s is the place for you. I&#39;ve driven past here a million times and have had it bookmarked. It&#39;s a hard place to ignore because the front store window reads &#34;Large Cheese Pizza $7.99!&#34; I don&#39;t know about you, but that caused some curiosity for me.

I&#39;m not sure why, but pizza has been my food craving lately. And on the way home from a 12 hour work day (knowing I have at least 3 more hours of work to do), plus the fact that my husband is out of town...Yeah. A quick and cheap pizza it is.

I walked into the store and there were a few folks waiting for their food. I placed my order for a large cheese pizza in anticipation of having leftovers to take care of another thoughtless meal for my busy week. The guy behind the counter was friendly and efficient. He informed me my pizza would be ready in 8 minutes and it was!

Once I was home and dove into my cheesy carb dinner (extra workouts for me tomorrow) I knew I had made the right decision. For only $8 the size and flavor of this pizza was beyond what I expected! Totally hit the spot. Now, with that being said, is this the best pizza I&#39;ve ever had? Well, no. But it sure is good, cheap, and prepared quickly. Exactly what I was looking for."

In a small strip mall it&#39;s nondescript with a YUGE sign hawking $7.99 14&#34; pizza with one topping.  This place is rough around the edges, dirty tables and cases of soda stacked up in one corner and a messy cooler with more soda.  Notwithstanding the appearance, I plunged forward into pizzaland.  They were out of fresh basil so I ordered cheese, tomato, spinach and sausage.  I noticed garlic was an option so I added that.  They also carry wings, so I got BBQ and cheese and garlic.  What I loved seeing is pizza by the slice, and they have it in a few varieties.  After about 15 minutes my order to go was ready and off I went to share my late night feast with my daughter.  The wings were so so, not crisp enough for my taste and rather bland.  Perhaps I should have gotten Buffalo... maybe next time.  Now don&#39;t get me wrong, the pizza was very good but my idea to add garlic ruined it.  I &#34;assumed&#34; it would be roasted but I didn&#39;t ask nor request it so that&#39;s on me.  However I have to question the wisdom behind putting big honking pieces of raw garlic all over and in the topping and it sort of ruined it.  I&#39;ll go back but HOLD THE GARLIC!  I&#39;d recommend them and will give it a second try."

This was a great time to adventure out of the normal delivery place and try something new. I came across this place on Yelp, of course, and it seemed like people enjoyed it so I had to give it a try. It was super convenient I was able to order right from the Yelp app using Eat24 (yay for avoiding any human interaction!) 

Looking over the menu and reviews, we decided on two pizzas, the veggie and the super (everything the veggie plus pepperoni and sausage). They only have one size, 14&#34; large. We also got an order of cheesy breadsticks. This place is cheap. Cost only around $30 bucks for everything including the delivery fees and all that. The order took a little longer than I would like, only being 3 miles from the house, but this is a first world problem as I could easily have gotten my ass into the car and picked it up. 

The pizza is fresh. All of the toppings were fresh, the sauce is slightly sweet and overall the pizza has a very &#34;made at home&#34; taste to it. It&#39;s not bad. Plenty of cheese, good crust. My only thing is I like caramelized pieces of cheese (read burnt, browned) and would have liked to see the pizza&#39;s cooked a tad bit longer. The breadsticks have mounds of cheese melted on them. I think the sauce is the true star. It&#39;s chunky, sweet, and fresh. 

Everyone in the fam enjoyed the pizza. We would get it again. It&#39;s fresh, and easy on the wallet. Support local, give it a try!"

I had been going to the Rosati&#39;s on Ogden for $4.50 big slice &amp; pop.   After doing a Yelp search, seeing the reviews on here, having $5 in my pocket ,  needing a quick lunch &amp; knowing it&#39;s 2 minutes from work, I thought I&#39;d give it a try.  

I walked in &amp; the place was clean with 4-5 tables &amp; a few patrons.  I was having a greeted very quickly &amp; nicely by the man at the counter.  I had had a bad morning and had the hankering for a big ole fountain pop but no fountain pop machines here.  Beverages are all served in bottles in the cooler on the wall.  Having been denied my chance for a fountain pop, I ordered a slice of sausage &amp; a water.  Total cost for my lunch $3.30!!  Slices for lunch here are $2!

When ordering pizza by the slice for lunch, I&#39;ve come to expect a big, thick, double dough-ish slice of pizza teeming with grease.  This was not that AT ALL.  It was a thin, nice, crisp crust and the slice was about 1/4 of a whole, store bought frozen pizza.  The pizza was very tasty! The sausage was outstanding but I wish there were more of it on the slice. The cheese was a good blend of cheeses and not just your standard issue mozzarella.  They also offer large, one topping pizzas for $7.   You&#39;re probably thinking that&#39;s Little Caesars but it&#39;s so much thinner &amp; tastier.  Let&#39;s also face it:  a large 1 topping pizza and pop here would be $9 or so.  Bargain, given all the pricier lunch options in the area.

If I am to find fault at all with this place, there wasn&#39;t quite enough meat on my pizza and there were no fountain pop machines.   I will definitely be back though!"

I was going to just grab a slice but decided on the whole pie, which they didn&#39;t have ready but knocked it out in record time. I will certainly try their other options when in the area. 

Always good to see an independent family start up business and experience what their passion might be. It appears these are service minded owners and Daniel is very personable.

I find their pie very tasty as their dough is made fresh everyday, as is the sauce. They have several combo meal deals but just offers up cans or bottles of pop."

It is a small pizza place in a strip mall, mainly carryout, however they do have some tables.  It is thin crust pizza and they cut it in triangles instead of Chicago style squares, so they get bonus points for that.  The prices are very reasonable and the portion sizes are quite large.  Staff was very friendly and for opening day they seemed pretty organized.  I got a pepperoni pizza with some breadsticks and everything was great.

So either I&#39;m a bit obsessed, the food is great, or perhaps a little of both.

Their pizza is excellent.  It&#39;s thin, New York style and has a great flavor and consistency.  What&#39;s nice is that you can grab a slice in one hand and eat it without the topping falling off, and the cheese has an excellent flavor.  My pet peeve, which does not apply to Papa Fresco&#39;s, is when the cheese slides off after you take a bite, especially when hot.

The cheesy bread is also very good, and my wife likes ther salads.

It&#39;s nice having this place nearby.  The owner is super friendly and I really hope it does well.  There have been other customers in line, dining in, and entering in afterward which is very promising.

Do yourself a favor and try a slice.  How can you go wrong for $2?  They also have combo deals.

I went in there just two get two slices of pizza which were $2.00 a slice.  The crust itself is very thin, but the slices are pretty decent, pretty much a 1/4th of the whole pizza.  

I got a pepperoni slice and a cheese slice, and both were very fresh and flavorful.  Even though the crust is thin, they are not stingy on the cheese and meat.  It tasted great!  Because I am a healthy eater, the thin crust was perfect because I do not like it when there is too much bread."

A clean visible kitchen. I&#39;ll get right to it. An online coupon brought us making it a good deal. By itself, the large cheese pizza for 7 bucks and 1.50 a topping is not a great deal. Why? the crust is a nice thin sturdy holder for otherwise bland toppings. the sauce is mediocre and seems like it comes from a can. The spinach they used was frozen chopped spinach and there was no seasoning on the pie. What was good was the cheesy garlic breadsticks. soft and chewy with plenty of fresh mozzarella. There are many other pizza places that can give you a better pizza for the money, even the new pizza hut line seems to be more appetizing. My suggestion to Papa is make a olive oil, garlic, parmesean spread with oregano and basil.. brush that around the crust then bake it.. watch how something cheap and simple can elevate a basic pizza."

It is really inexpensive and the quality is definitely there.  Plenty of cheese and toppings and did I mention the dough is HOMEMADE!  You cannot beat the price!

I&#39;ve ordered from here numerous times when the kids have their friends over.  It&#39;s nice to be able to feed a bunch of tweens without having to dip into their college fund to pay for it.  

Papa Fresco offers a few specialty pizza options for a few bucks more.  While the kids enjoy their one topping $6.99 pizza, my favorite is the spicy Italian pizza (beef and hot peppers)."

I was taken care of promptly and even asked if I wanted some wine while I waited for my food. The waitress forgot to give me my drinks when I left and called me right away to deliver them to me in the car. I saw a couple sampling wine from the dozens on the wall too which was cool.

I love all Coopers but this location was pretty great. If you&#39;re a wine lover the wine club is a must. It&#39;s about 20.00 a month and you get a free bottle of wine per month. We started off at the bar getting samples of wine per the wine club membership. You can imagine how wasted/tipsy you get towards the end when you&#39;re about to sit at your table. The bartenders were hilarious and super friendly. Maybe that was just the wine talking but it did the trick. 

Staff was friendly when we sat down. We were tend to throughout the entire dinner which is a must in my book if you&#39;ve seen my previous reviews. I got the salmon which was about 21.00 or so. Super delicious. We also got the medallions medium rare. I am no where near a blood lover and I really prefer my steak not to moo. Howeverrrrrr Coopers got me like whoa and I&#39;m slowly going from well done, medium well, medium, to now medium rare all because of their steak. It&#39;s like hell has frozen over but I am a believer. It was perfectly juicy and not super under cooked. Very succulent and practically like butter. 

We had the cheesecake and some type of chocolate balls(ha) for dessert. Holy f! So flame so fire aka really frickin delicious. Cheesecake was like you could just taste the fresh milk, butter, cream, everythinnggggg sex in my mouth j swear. The chocolate balls were amazeballs literally and figuratively.

Fairly pricey but you&#39;re getting what you pay for in quality."

It was all so underwhelming and to top it off there was a guy creeping around the dining room with a tablet updating all the tables on the reservation system.

The food is so bland!  The Trio of Medallions was an ok dish.  The steak itself was great, however, the mash potatoes were nasty.  I&#39;m thinking they were from a box because they were stiff, not creamy and taste absolutely horrible.  Okay, the other two I had two week prior was the Gnocchi Chicken Pasta (see pic).  It is a nice picture, but the WORST tasting pasta ever.  I actually took a couple bites and did not eat the rest. UGH!  The lettuce wraps were okay, nothing special, however, it was the only thing I really liked here other than the steak.

Now on to the drinks... The only reason I am giving this place 3 stars, is the service and the drink menu.  I did not like the Coopers Hawk Bellini, but the Peach Sangria knocked it out of the park.  That was happiness in a big glass.  Also, the plum wine and the passion fruit wine was great!  I know.. Plum right? I promise you, it - does - not taste like Plum.  I do not like Plums, but this wine was delicious.  If you drink enough, maybe you&#39;ll enjoy the food haha!  

Wait... I almost forgot!! The Cr√®me Brulee, how dare I forget this.  As you know, this is my favorite dessert and they did a great job at it.  However, honestly, how could you mess up Cr√®me Brulee? Enjoy :)"

We just had one slight hiccup when we first were checking in, but besides that everything was great.

Came with a group on a Friday night and it was packed (be sure to make a reservation!!).  They helped the waiting process by passing out samples of one of their wines by the door.  It was definitely a warm welcome.

So our little hiccup happened just at the beginning, we had a 6pm reservation and were waiting on some of our party still (20 minutes later), we were going to be a pretty big group they wouldn&#39;t let us sit until half of our party was there, and then when we were waiting, even though we had half of the party, they were a little antsy to seat us as they had an 8pm reservation for the big table.  It worked out because the 8pm ended up canceling, but it&#39;s not cool to refuse to seat us when we could have at least gotten started with some appetizers, and then turn around and complain about us not being seated because our whole party wasn&#39;t there.  OK RANT OVER.

So the servers definitely made up for it, one was training, which may have accounted for the slightly slower service (again, why so slow if you were trying to get us out?  OK RANT REALLY OVER THIS TIME).  They have a pretty varied menu, and a quite a few different types of wines to choose from.  They do wine flights and sangria flights (although it&#39;s not on the menu).  Their wines are really good, and this is coming from someone who doesn&#39;t really like wine.

The food is also exceptional, Crab Cake bites appetizer, Burrata Prosciutto &amp; Arugula bruschetta, Cooper&#39;s Hawk Calamari, get them all.  They are all delicious.  For the main dish I had Dana&#39;s Parmesan-crusted Chicken.  Although the portion was pretty generous it was so delicious I ate the whole thing.

We rolled out of there pretty satisfied.  It&#39;s a great place with good wine and good food.  If you&#39;re a wine-drinker, enjoy their food, and go there often enough, their wine club is also a great deal."

It&#39;s always the first suggestion for after work drinks and snacks and it&#39;s very apparent why that is.  

I have never had food here that I did not like.  Granted, I&#39;m vegetarian, so I&#39;m very limited in what I can eat here because this is a restaurant (like so many) that like to put meat into everything.  My favorite appetizer that I have eaten here is the Thai Lettuce Wraps.  I will admit- I enjoy building my own food.  So, I liked that they serve everything deconstructed and you can build your own wraps.  But I thought that the sauce on those wraps was delicious.  I could drink it, it was so good.  I&#39;ve also enjoyed the Mediterranean Plate which is good.  I also like some of their flat bread options- the roasted vegetable &amp; goat cheese is very good, as is the caprese. 

I really like the flatbread &amp; salad/ soup &amp; salad combinations.  Last time that I came to Cooper&#39;s Hawk, I ordered the ceasar pesto &amp; lobster bisque and that combination was divine.  The salad had so much flavor and the bisque was so creamy with just the right amount of lobster (aka not a whole lot).  I think this will be my go-to dish from here on out.  

I also have many coworkers who do the wine club.  I have a few of their wines.  I like the sparkling almond wine, but I can only drink it on certain occasions because I do not like sweet wine all that much.  I have had their Sauvignon Blanc which I very much enjoyed.  I also really liked their cabernet.  So, I feel like their wines hit all the bases (red, white, sweet).  

The staff have always been friendly.  But if you can, make a reservation because this is a hot spot and it&#39;s hard to get in at certain times.  But definitely worth a try!"

The wait staff is always friendly, and the interior is the nicest of all their locations. They have a lovely private room you can rent for events that is decorated with wine barrels, and floor to ceiling glass windows. You can&#39;t go wrong if you order one of the following:

- roasted vegetable goat cheese flatbread
-chicken madeira
-cilantro ranch chicken sandwich
-bbq ranch chicken salad
-blackened bleu steak salad (my personal fav! tangy vinaigrette balanced out with feta cheese and bleu cheese dressing)

You really can&#39;t go wrong with any of their wines either. For a small price you can sample some wines as you wait for your table, or afterwards to pick out a bottle to bring home with you. As a wine club member, the one bottle a month membership is really worth the price (especially if you plan on sharing the membership with someone). I split it with my fiance and for $9 a month per person, you usually get a bottle that costs around $30 regularly. They also have food promotions and other specials available to members monthly."

I came here with my family to celebrate a birthday for lunch.  I was happy that they seemed to know how to accommodate a group because they had options ready to present for wines for the table and appetizers that are easy to share.  We ordered all of the above and then ordered off-menu for our individual entrees.

The menu is large and has meat entrees, burgers, sandwiches, seafood - something for every eater.  I enjoyed my veggie burger since you can get ANY of their burgers subbed with a house-made veggie patty.  I enjoyed my spicy burger with an egg on top of my veggie patty.  Yum.  The fried jalapeno pieces were delish and the burger really was spicy, which was excellent.  Others in my group seemed to really enjoy the food that they got so everyone was happy.  All in all, a satisfying dining experience.

The servers are happy to make recommendations for wines to try, wines that pair well with certain menu items, etc.  There&#39;s also cheese and charcuterie boards for those who are just interested in a light meal with their wine flight.  Parking can be a bit tricky to find since this Cooper&#39;s Hawk is in the downtown Burr Ridge shopping center area.

The event space was adequate, however, there was no way to show a electronic presentation in the room we were in, so we were forced to use large poster boards.  

The service was not the best. We were a medium sized group (about 20 people) and we were deserted for most of the meal. Everyone had to order all their drinks quickly all at once, for fear of never being asked again. 

There were two food options for our group, a meat or a chicken. I ordered the Dana&#39;s Parmesan-Crusted Chicken. The chicken was good, but it&#39;s definitely nothing I would order again. It was served with green beans and a rich potato dish. 

The wine was tasty, but much of it was too sweet for me to be tempted to buy a bottle on my way out. 

All in all, there was really nothing special to bring me back and there were some disappointing parts (likely due to being part of a larger group)."

Here you can find a pretty good selection of wine, wine gifts and delicious food to cater to all palates. 

If you are inclined to have a bottle of wine at dinner and enjoy having a selection of reasonably priced wine at your home, the wine club is worth looking into. For a set price each month, you receive 1-2
bottles of wine and depending on the package, free monthly wine tastings. You can take your accrued wine home with you or you can enjoy it while eating at the restaurant or bar without a corkage fee. If you are unlikely to visit monthly, it is still great. The bottles accumulate and you can pick them up anytime. That said, I have gone on a hiatus and picked up 8 bottles. I have a friend who used a year&#39;s worth of wine for her rehearsal dinner. You also incur points which equate to dollars you can spend when dining. 

Now that I am through raving about their wine club membership, I can tell you about the amazing menu options. I love their drunken shrimp, southern grilled shrimp and polenta and the bannoche pie. I can also say I have not tried a menu item that I did not enjoy. 

I have had the pleasure of dining at this location twice within the last month and it is my preferred location and one I plan to visit regularly going forward."

We decided to try the tasting while we were there. I really enjoyed the wine tasting our host was this really nice girl by the name of Shelby. She already knew one of girlfriends because she signed her up to be a wine club member. However I was really impressed that she actually remembers her and you would have thought that they were really close friends. While we were tasting Shelby was telling me about the wine member benefits and I must say it really is worth it to be a member. 

When we used my friends member card she was able to get two free tastings and also get a deal on the chocolate covered strawberries we also order. We also were able to use her member card towards our bill which allowed us to have the price cut dramatically.  At this location they had a pretty good selection of wine, wine gifts and delicious food to cater to all palates. We were seated as soon as our tasting was finished, Shelby had told them to add us to their list so we wouldn&#39;t have to wait which was perfect. 

For dinner I ordered the sweet red/ romance red bottle of wine at dinner. I ordered the SPINACH &amp; CHEESE CANNELLONI WITH SHRIMP which was a pasta. The pasta was really good. The portions are a really great size, my friend and I shared our pasta so that we both could if we liked it. I am not sure what pasta she had but that was also very good. We all were pleased with our food.

I ordered the Jalape√±o Burger medium but received it somewhere between rare and medium rare... and the server explained to me that the temperature of the burger is indeed medium and I am wrong for complaining the this cow was still moving.

Fun for a date night before or after dinner or while you&#39;re waiting for your carry out order. We really liked the fruity cranberry wine and prosecco. We have tried at least half of the items on the menu and my favorite is the BBQ ranch chicken salad and the gnocchi carbonara. It&#39;s convenient that they now offer online restaurant reservations and online ordering for carry-out. My only gripe is they often update the menu and some of my favorite dishes disappear.

Wow tonight was the most horrible experience at Cooper&#39;s.  My first visit. We started with wine tasting. After we were seated at our table. The waitress (Barbara)  took our order.  She only asked once how we were doing. She would pass by our table (didn&#39;t ask if we need anything). We had to flag her down each time we needed service. Poor customer service tonight. Mixed up my friend&#39;s reward card. She had to wait 1/2 hour to clear up the confusion to get her bottle of wine. Salad was delivered 15 minutes after meal. Manager (Ken) accommodated us with wine tasting and free appetizers. Not worth a return visit for us. So sad that this restaurant did not give genuine costumer service. Little effort means a lot. By the way I hear other location offers better service.

In addition, I&#39;m considering not renewing my monthly wine membership. Is this an organization we really want to be a part of? Not so sure. What I am sure of is, the hostess desk needs to be staffed with the most friendly and positive people in the building. If they change anything expeditiously, it should be never let a staff member tell a customer &#34;I don&#39;t know what to tell you, we&#39;re running behind, you&#39;ll be seated&#34;.

We tried this one out since it&#39;s the closest location to my office. We came on really snowy/crappy day so it wasn&#39;t overly busy until we were leaving around 6:30-7pm. First we did the wine tasting and the guy doing our tasting (forgot his name) was so knowledgeable about each wine we were trying. We&#39;ve done several tastings at the Orland location, and they just fill up the glasses and move on to the next guest. This was a nice a touch! I also opted in for the Wine Club since we go to Cooper&#39;s Hawk so often.

Our dinner was good, as expected. I got the Parmesan chicken, which is a spin on the more traditional style (no noodles, no heavy sauce), which I liked. My friend got the ahi tuna which is her go-to. We also ALWAYS get the cheese platter. Always, always. We love it, and we love the little sign that comes with it telling you about the cheeses you&#39;re eating. They ran out of the pepper jelly though and we weren&#39;t that big of a fan of the one they replaced it with. 

Our server was great! She knew we weren&#39;t in a rush to go back out and drive in the snowy / rain/ slush that had fallen upon us so she didn&#39;t pressure us to leave quickly at all. 

Of course the wine is awesome as always. I&#39;m a sweet wine drinker because I&#39;m not a big fan of traditional wine, and their cranberry, plum, raspberry, passion fruit, and cranberry mixed with sparkling almond wine are my absolute favorites. 

If you are a fan of wine, definitely try out Cooper&#39;s Hawk. They have something for everyone!"

I&#39;m a big wine drinker, my husband doesn&#39;t drink at all, boo.  

We had a reservation for 7 and got there a little early.  The tasting area was packed, maybe it felt more that way because it was a cramped space.  We were seated at like 6:45.  They send you a text message when your table is ready.  I like that way better than those stupid vibrating light up buzzer things.

I had been eyeballing the menu for three or four days prior to our arrival so I already knew what I was going to order: the gnocchi with roasted butternut squash.  Oh and a white wine flight of course.  No appetizers because I think only one was vegetarian and I&#39;m not a fan of lettuce wraps of any variety.  Ew.  

There was a note on the little piece of paper they left on our table that it was our anniversary but we didn&#39;t get anything special like some others mentioned that they did.  I didn&#39;t expect anything, but it&#39;s always fun when it happens.

Husband ordered the churrasco grilled steak which he loved.  He also raved about his parmesan fries.  He didn&#39;t even ask for steak sauce or ketchup.  

As for the wine... the chardonnay was the best.  It was all good but the one I cared for the least was the Cooper&#39;s Hawk White.  It was almost too sweet for me.  I had to put a couple ice cubes in it to kind of water it down.  I drank it all though, of course.  The glasses definitely held a generous amount.  I&#39;ve had some flights before that had half of what I was given.

We got dessert which was the banoffee pie or something like that.  As the menu describes, it&#39;s graham cracker crust (they had me at that), bananas, toffee filling topped with whipped cream.  That was goooooooood.  We split it.  I&#39;m not a huge dessert person in my aging ways, but an exception was made for this evening.

And of course, I ended up signing up for the wine club.  One bottle a month variety of white and red.  I was a little tipsy from my wine flight so I sat there and stared at the brochure for like 20 minutes trying to read it, but not really comprehending what it said so I&#39;m not exactly sure how it works, but hopefully I figure it out soon.  I assume I&#39;ll get an email or something to tell me to go pick up my bottle.  

I&#39;d like it even more if my husband would have a damn glass of wine with me but that isn&#39;t going to ever happen so I guess it&#39;ll be just me indulging in the fruits of their winemaking labor."

My boyfriend got the jambalaya, which he was very pleased with because jambalaya is his favorite dish to eat. And I ordered the trio of medallions than were also very delicious. 

I would have given them 5 stars, but I asked for a medium cook on the medallions and it was medium well more than anything. One of the medallions didn&#39;t even have any pink left at all in it. I&#39;ll definitely be returning though."

This was my first tasting ever (I&#39;m far from a wine connoisseur), so I wasn&#39;t exactly sure what to expect. Before going, I asked a friend, who previously lived in Napa, what to expect at a tasting. He told me that I would be able to just taste a few sips of wines or spit. However, this tasting had a lot more wine than I anticipated. You get eight &#34;tastings&#34; which are really glasses filled almost a third with wine. Wow! I selected the variety tasting, though all sweet wine was also an option. For someone who hasn&#39;t tried a lot of wine I like, I was impressed by how tasty some of the selections were. Due to the volume of wine, I recommend doing a tasting first, then settling into a long dinner if you&#39;re driving home. My only complaints were that the bar was pretty small, so I kept bumping into the guy next to me (there also weren&#39;t chairs). There were people waiting behind us to taste also. Although service was generally really friendly and competent (there were several people taking care of us), I wasn&#39;t a fan that one bartender tried to convince me to join the Wine Club multiple times throughout the tasting. Overall it was a fantastic experience, totally a steal for $7, and I will return! 

Next up was dinner. We are both vegetarians and there were plenty of options from which to choose. We both decided on the black bean burger to ensure we ate something substantial enough to soak up the wine. Service was cordial and efficient. We enjoyed a delicious pretzel bread and butter while waiting for our food. Luckily, the wait wasn&#39;t long at all. My black bean burger was very thick and big. The fries were great, too! Even though the entree was good, the pretzel bread was so delicious that I&#39;m still salivating over it now. 

I had a really positive experience here and I&#39;m definitely a fan. I will for sure be back to try another tasting and more menu items!"

We scored free street parking and arrived about 15 minutes early for our reservation. While we were waiting, we were given samples of spiced winter wine, which was very nice. We did not have to wait the full 15 minutes for our table, maybe we waited 7 or 8 minutes. Our table was in a nice dining room, way less congested than the Orland Park location. Server was attentive and friendly. She let us try our wine before we committed. She also brought us yummy pretzel bread to snack on.

Our drunken shrimp appetizer was fun. The menu had a lot of options, including gluten free and lighter portions. I opted for gluttony and red meat with parmesan fries, which turned out to be a good choice. 

The desserts were good. Ample portions, which is great for sharing."

Everything about it is AMAZING! We started a wine tasting and when we were only three tastings in, we were notified that our table was ready. Our bartender, who was absolutely wonderful and very informative on the different wines available, told us that since we only had three tastings that there would be no charge. We also signed up for the wine club with her before we went to our table. We each ordered a wine flight and enjoyed every single glass. Our waiter gave us recommendations and he matched wines perfectly for our tastes. He even brought us an extra tasting each because my husband couldn&#39;t decide between two of the wines for his flight. We ordered the Caprese Flatbread as an appetizer which was truly the best flatbread I&#39;ve ever eaten. For dinner I ordered the Parmesean Crusted Chicken and my husband had the Parmesean Crusted Filet Medallions and Pistachio Crusted Flounder. My meal was seriously the best meal I&#39;ve ever had ands my husband enjoyed his thoroughly as well.  He was raving about the Filet Medallions throughout our meal.

The ambiance and concept of Cooper&#39;s Hawk is great...casual but nice at the same time, with good hearty food and numbered to easily pair with wines on the menu.  I was traveling and staying nearby for 2 days and came both nights for dinner...and both nights were busy with waits for tables, but there was seats at the bar.  So I sat down, and asked for a couple tastes...you would have thought I was asking the bartender to do something horribly awful, as he reluctantly poured me some offerings, without any suggestions at all.  It was a bit unexpected, as most wine centric places tend to talk a lot about their wine offerings...I would think a winery that makes their own has even more to offer.

The menu is lengthy and a bit overwhelming, with so many choices...bartender was no help at all with any suggestions...in fact, i had to flag him down to come take my order.  I ordered a great pasta dish that had mushrooms, tomatoes and cream sauce.  The second night, I had an appetizer order of seared tuna tacos that hit the spot.  I tried the banana bread ice cream sandwich for dessert, which was so decadent, sweet and delicious.  I would have stayed longer to try out more wines and watch 2 Boston (Red Sox &amp; Patriots) sports games that played on consecutive nights on the bar area TVs, but I seriously felt like the bartender was giving me the evil eye despite the bar area not being busy, so I paid and left.

On my way out during the second visit, I stopped in the retail portion of the winery/restaurant and wanted to buy a couple of truffles.  I bought 2 and then asked a question from the girl behind the counter regarding one of the truffles&#39; ingredients, and she said, &#34;yeah, I&#39;m not sure&#34; and walked away to help another customer.  Fine then, Cooper Hawk staff, you don&#39;t want me to buy anymore and be a patron in the bar area, I get the message."

My lady friend decided that we should try their wine tastings first before dinner...Im always up for a few sips before a meal. There wasn&#39;t much space for some new faces at the bar the tastings were being held so we had to wait. We found ourselves waiting for 20 mins, so the lady behind the bar allowed us to have some wine from afar. Soon enough a space opened up so we were able to enjoy our tastings comfortably. Most of the wines were delicious!

We drank ourselves into quite an appetite, so we headed for the dining area. Our server able was a very nice guy and was quite helpful in picking out the dishes and pairing them up with the proper wine. We started with the crab cakes which may be the best crab cakes I&#39;ve ever had.My entree was the crusted salmon which was just ok, but that may be because it followed those delicious crab cakes. My friend got the Gnocchi which was even better. We got a sweet red to go with our meal and it wasn&#39;t too sweet and was very goodAbel was able to convince us to try dessert so he brought out an apple pie topped with vanilla ice cream...simply delicious!

This is a pretty good place and you can join their wine club which has different tiers. I am now a fan of Cooper&#39;s Hawk! Yep I bought a few bottles to go"

I love me some Coopers Hawk!   I usually frequent the Orland location, but I found myself in this outdoor mall area of Burr Ridge, and decided to stop in and pick up the 4-bottles I had waiting for me.

The lobby area/tasting area is small and cramped.   I thought Orland&#39;s was bad, but this one is really tight.   I figured I had a few free tastings on my file, so I bellied up to the tasting bar and partook.   The server conducting my tasting was great!   It can be hit or miss with the people that work the tasting bar - in terms of their friendliness and knowledge.  She was on point for both!   Made the tasting much more enjoyable.

I didn&#39;t eat here this time, since I just gorged myself on sushi at Wok &#39;n Roll (review to come) next door.   However, I&#39;ve eaten at CH about 100 times in the past and the food is always consistent and on-point.

Our reservation for seven allowed us to get a private room, which was decorated with rustic oak barrels. Nice atmosphere.

The Cooper&#39;s Hawk Sampler on the appetizer menu provided a nice variety of small bites for this size of a group. Standouts included the Chicken Potstickers and the Over the Border Egg Rolls. The Calamari was fine, though unexceptional, and the Crab Cakes lacked a little structure, though they tasted fine.

Their Fish &amp; Chips received positive comments from my fellow diners (no skimping on portion sizes here), as did the Soy Ginger Salmon. My Cilantro Ranch Chicken sandwich was a solid entry, and the fries on the side left no room for dessert.

The waitstaff were friendly, and the overall vibe was nice, though not overly formal. I&#39;d definitely come back."

On this day for lunch, I had the blackened tilapia salad and for an appetizer we tried the calamari. 
 Both dishes I had were very good, the calamari was done to perfection. Calamari sometimes is a hit or miss, if cooked to much it&#39;s rubbery, they know how to cook it here. You do receive 3 sauces with the calamari, I would call them gourmet sauces, they were ok but I&#39;m a plain old guy and would much prefer cocktail sauce. The tilapia salad was tasty and plentiful, after eating to much awesome bread and the appetizer, I didn&#39;t leave much room for salad.
 We did not wait for a table today, my one concern about visiting Cooper&#39;s Hawk is the wait time for dinner, make a reservation! It gets VERY busy at dinner time and you could wait 45-90 minutes on a busy night."

We&#39;d never been there before but the reviews along with family and friends said it&#39;d be a perfect place for dinner.  We couldn&#39;t get a reservation until 915, but that&#39;s how it goes on Saturday nights. The night started off weird when we showed up 3 minutes before our reservation and the woman at the host stand (who seemed bothered we were interrupting her while another server scratched her head) told me to sit down and she&#39;d text me when it was closer to our reservation time. We were seated 10 minutes later, no bigs. 

Our waiter asked if either of us had been there before, we replied no. Now, from all the reviews I was ready for a go through of the menu,  amazing pretzel bread and a couple wine tastings but that&#39;s not what we got at all. 

Food was ok.  We had the caprese flat bread ( which has to have some sort of nut in it as the bf started to have a mild reaction) it wasn&#39;t anything special. He had the French onion soup and enjoyed that. I ordered surf n turf of the crab cakes and parm crusted medallions.  The crab cakes were on point but the medallions were over cooked and salty. The bf had the short ribs which he said he loved because it was really good comfort food. Dessert was meh typical cake and easy creme brulee.

The place is always crowded. There is a bar area, wine tasting area, restaurant and shop. Early this week I went there with friends. They offer a life balance menu (lighter fare) and gluten free items so there is something for all.  Upon sitting down, 3 out of 5 of us had plates that had old food stuck to them at our place settings.  Not a good start.  The warm small pretzel loaf of bread they bring to the table is very good. We went through that quickly. Everyone enjoyed their food that they ordered. A big hit with my friends was the blue cheese burger with crispy onions.  I enjoyed the tuna taco appetizer for my entree. These were small bites that had big flavor of rare blackened tuna with cilantro, sriracha and avocado in a crispy shell. It was so good.  I ordered a side of the Asian slaw as well and was very disappointed.  It usually is creamy and flavorful. Unfortunately, the creamy dressing was nowhere to be found. The slaw was extremely dry and not enjoyable.  Thankfully, I had wasabi cream served with my tacos and used that to give some moisture to the slaw. Lastly, my cappuccino that I ordered at the end of my meal was served lukewarm at best. Another disappointment. There is no reason it shouldn&#39;t be piping hot with steamed foam and hot espresso. It must have sat for awhile before being served to me. Even with the mishaps, I do recommend this place for the food and wine. They have a wonderful menu. I gave a rating of two stars deducting a star for each of the three mishaps...unclean dish in front of me, no dressing on my slaw and a lukewarm cappuccino. Hopefully, they will pay more attention to the little details."

The main concept of pairing food and wine, exclusively made by Cooper&#39;s Hawk, is made simple and undaunting. They will provide you a sample of you&#39;re on the fence. I highly suggest accepting the sample of the Wine of the Month each time.

Even if they didn&#39;t serve wine, I would go for their food. A list of favorites: BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad, MMM Pork Medallions, Steak and Bleu Cheese Salad or Burger, Bacon-Wrapped Shrimp. Oh yea, the complimentary pretzel bread is absolutely delish!

Lunch specials are very fairly priced and portioned. Dinner is a little more but you receive a more exquisite meal for far less than you would expect.

Admittedly, I dined in sweats, jeans and pants depending on the time and occasion. Never have I felt out of place.

Join the Wine Club if you will come back - and you will go back. Only Wine Club Members can take home bottles of the Wine of the Month. You may stock pile bottles to take home a variety or multiples of the same wine."

To make it worse, while I waited all that time I was never even offered a 2nd glass of wine. At one point they lied and said our food was &#34;at the window, about to come out&#34;... Then they brought us more bread, &#34;to eat  while we waited&#34;, which was for another 10 minutes. Half of the entr√©es were lukewarm. Mine was super greasy. One person didn&#39;t even get their food. It was laughable... Food was totally mediocre. Atrocious service. Hardly an apology or explanation from the servers.

We were seated in the bar which was quite a surprise to us. It was very loud so trying to carry a conversation was difficult. We ordered the shrimp appetizer and it was excellent.

We will definitely return but possibly on a less busy night."

I have had the ribs just once before and remember them being very enjoyable. These were the same: sweet sauce, tender meat, served nice and hot with a side potato and garlic bread. I&#39;d like the BBQ sauce to be a bit thicker (and spicier) but they were SO TENDER! Seriously, fall-off-the-bone tender. A feel rack is a bit of a commitment for a regular eater but if you&#39;re a Portillo&#39;s fan who&#39;s never had them you must try them.

I&#39;d definitely get the ribs again. They are totally worth it.

Oh, and I&#39;ll ALWAYS come to Portillo&#39;s (no matter the location) because it is SO GOOD!"

I was encouraged to visit Portillo&#39;s by the Marriott Hotel staff since I had not been to Portillo&#39;s before.  It was in close proximity to the hotel.  I arrived to a walk-up line with overhead menus.  I&#39;m glad that I had a few minutes to check out the menu because there were so many offerings.  I decided that I would order the Jumbo Chili Dog, Crinkle Cut Fries, a half rack of ribs and a Diet Coke.  The ordering process was easy, the wait to order wasn&#39;t too bad and then I had to wait a bit at the pick-up window to get my food.

The food came out pretty quick so I then found a table in the dining area to eat.  I ate my food and thought it was good and was impressed with the quality of the food compared to the price I paid; there was some value there, believe it or not.  I had decided that I was going to order dessert to go so I approached the order line again.

I ordered the vanilla malt and the chocolate cake to-go.  The ordering process was easy, the wait to order wasn&#39;t too bad and then I had to wait a bit at the pick-up window to get my food.

This time, the wait time was excessively long.  Fortunately, the have expediters up front so she called out that she needed my vanilla malt three times.  I took my dessert order to-go and ate it later at the hotel. For those of you who are brave, they do sell a cake shake.  

Overall, I was very pleased with my visit and was in awe of how busy this place is. There are so many employees in the back that make things happen here.  Four stars!"

My boyfriends family tends to order food together, and we get a pretty large bundle of food. Yes, the more you order, the more likely something will be messed up. But that doesn&#39;t excuse it happening, and happening EVERY TIME we pick up food from here.

It seems as if there are so many people doing so many different jobs that orders get lost in translation. Something will be missing, something will be wrong, something will have mayo, and the list goes on and on.

I will say, besides that, this location is on point. The service is good. One time we waited so long and they gave us a slice of chocolate cake. That was nice, but something we ordered was STILL wrong. I would rather wait a long time and have the order right than have them hurry to get the order done and mess it up.

That being said. I will never stop eating here because the food is so good. I just advise customers ordering a lot of food for pickup to check it all before you leave!"

Last time I had it drowned and it was not that great, I am a texture gal and it was just too mushy. Dry bread is BETTER! 

From the time I walk into this place I get hyped, the music they have going on as they greet you into the door is awesome! It just takes me back to an old era and fun atmosphere. This place is always bustling and the lines are long but the do move quickly. 

I did a survey and was able to claim my FREE LARGE FRIES which are normally $2.25. I also tried their hot dogs, since Vince Vaughn raved so much about them, and they are just Okay, not a big deal. I have honestly like them better grilled and at home."

I had a business lunch at this location recently and yes, I chowed down on an Italian meat sandwich, and fries, in a full suit and tie.  I got out of there clean, too, I&#39;m proud to say!  

This place was jam packed at a little after 1 PM (thought we were gonna wait out the lunch rush - wrong!).  We had a divide-and-conquer strategy for securing a booth and obtaining our food, which all worked out.  I did some people watching while I was waiting to order and then waiting for the food.  Portillo&#39;s attracts them all - old/young, black/white, business people and families with little kids, you name it.  Everyone likes to eat at Portillo&#39;s.

I think I&#39;ll get a hot dog of some kind next time I&#39;m in there.  As you may have inferred at the beginning, the Italian meat took its toll on my for the remainder of that afternoon/evening, making it somewhat difficult to concentrate/stay awake and be productive in subsequent meetings.  Nonetheless, it was delicious and worth it.

This location has a two-lane drive thru, too.

Instead, Portillo&#39;s, at least this location, was a well-oiled lunch machine, with welcoming staff and hot food served fast. This is a chain I&#39;d love to see make it to Colorado.

I had a fully loaded hot dog, and a polish with grilled onions. I always knew that I liked Chicago dogs, I just don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to be able to eat them anywhere outside of the city now. The sausage itself was amazing, and the toppings turn it into a meal. The polish had its own great flavor, and who doesn&#39;t like grilled onions and mustard?"

However, their Italian beef was too soggy for my taste. It was difficult for me to eat the sandwich since it kept falling apart.  I would highly recommend the Maxwell hot dog (the grilled onions are the best part.) If you are planning to get the fries, pay an extra 60 cents for the hot cheese. You will not regret it. Also, if you are planning to get a drink, get a regular size one instead of a large because a regular size drink at Portillo is basically a large compared to other fast food joints. 

My friends kept telling me how Portillo has the best chopped salad ever and I always wanted to try it. On my last visit to Portillo, I ordered a Caesar salad and one of my friends was like &#34; why did you get a Caesar salad&#34; and I was like because they are famous for it.

The restaurant was of good sized and decorated with pictures and all types of ornaments on the wall and ceiling. You could literally walk into this establishment everyday and discover something new. 

Service was quick when I decided to go with a Chicago dog with everything of course and an Italian beef fully dipped. What other way should one get it. For those of you watching your figures there is a salad option where they make your salad in front of you at a separate side counter. The dog was great as I devoured the whole Chicago dog. I want to scold some people as I saw someone picking the tomatoes and sports peppers off their dog. What is this world coming to? The Italian beef was good but wished it was dipped in gravy a few more times to get a little extra juice.

The atmosphere is great and if it your first time the staff is more than happy to help you out with suggestions of their favorites."

I don&#39;t even care where I get it either, the zoo, airport, ball game, shoot, I&#39;ll even get it at the gas station if it&#39;s available! 

But this has to be the best tasting Chicago dog I have ever had! There really is something about Portillo&#39;s that makes them great, it just has a snap to them that makes you wish you ordered two.

As for the drive thru, I think other chains should take note. Not only is it a FAST drive thru, there are 2 lanes .... TWO lanes.

My friend got the garden salad, which was extremely fresh and tasted amazing.

Maxwell Street polish is also a good choice if you&#39;re not feelin&#39; all the toppings. Their Italian Beef is also tops.

What a world of difference. The bread was nice and crusty and the actual beef had the tiniest hint of spice to it that was just delectable. Get it with both sweet and hot peppers (I don&#39;t know if this is some kind of affront to the honor of the Italian beef sandwich but that&#39;s how I had it) and you&#39;ll get this slightly vinegary slightly tangy and ever so faintly spicy experience that really elevates the sandwich. I&#39;m sorry for blasting the Italian beef in my previous review, I was lost but now I am found.

I don&#39;t think this makes sense to you so let me explain this. You know how every home is different right? Some homes are just totally messed up. Some homes pretend to be perfect. The rest? Well, they admit that they aren&#39;t perfect, but they make it work. This home makes you feel like removing your bra or pants or both (not literally though) at the door step because you want to be comfortable. This place makes you comfortable gorging down huge bites of food and nobody will judge you (ok maybe your conservative grandma who tells you that you need to be modest or you will never find a husband). This is what this Portillo&#39;s feels like. It feels like home.

I have to drive a good 10-15 minutes to get here because I don&#39;t think I should pay tolls when I&#39;m already starving. Ambiance is great especially when we come in a few hours before closing time. It&#39;s quiet and we always get a coveted booth without fighting like The Game of Thrones. 

My favorite is obviously the FAMOUS ITALIAN BEEF. However, I do not like drowning it in all it&#39;s juicy goodness. I prefer my sandwich dry with hot peppers a side of gravy. Dipped sandwich just makes the bread soggy and lose it&#39;s crunch. I also order their freshly fried fries (say this 10 time faster) with a side of their hot cheddar which makes everything taste better. They also have this chocolate cake shake with, you guessed it, chocolate shake and ground up chocolate cake. I think this is too thick to suck through a tiny straw so your other option would be to scoop it out with a spoon (or fork since they seem to have gotten rid of their spoons). I always want to order this with my meal but my conscience tells me no so I end up getting a lemonade instead.

Overall, I always leave happy and stuffed after a night out in Portillo&#39;s. It&#39;s pretty cheap and satisfying. What more could you ask for?

PS. Portillo&#39;s staff who manage their Yelp reviews: Could you please change the battery of the paper towel dispenser in the women&#39;s bathroom? I always end up waiting for a minute or two before I get another paper towel which is frustrating due to the fact that I really just want to eat my food before it turns cold. Thanks!"

I gave recommendations for the Italian beef (dipped) and the Chicago style hot dog. Both received rave reviews. For myself, I got my favorite, the chopped salad. It is chopped romaine and iceberg lettuce mixed with Ditalini pasta, chicken breast, bacon, tomato, red cabbage, Gorgonzola cheese, green onion and house dressing. I add a little balsamic vinegar to kick it up a notch. The hot dog is served on a poppy seed bun (not my favorite). I always end up rubbing the bun to take off as many of the seeds as I can. It comes with a pickle but I take it off and it is still good with the remaining ingredients ( mustard, relish, chopped onions, tomato slices and sport peppers). The portions here are plentiful and even enough to share.
All areas are clean, multiple cashiers to minimize long lines and a drive thru too.  Take some time to review and plan out what your next meal will be. Although many pick a favorite and hardly stray; you have to expand your palate to the other tremendously good options."

They have several people outside.  One to take your order, one to process the payment &amp; then one to hand you your food.  The line at this restaurant could be a mile long &amp; it seems that they would have you out of here in five minutes.  

The hot dogs here are always great &amp; the poppy seed bun always makes it better than a lot of other restaurants.  The Italian Beef here never disappoints &amp; ordering it dipped makes it even tastier.  

Overall this place has good service &amp; the drive thru is always fast.  The food is consistently good &amp; I would definitely eat here again."

One thing I did notice when I was unwrapping my sandwich was how greasy and oily it was. But it was so yummy! I got the spicy pepper and it wasn&#39;t spicy at all!

It&#39;s normal, and it&#39;s ok. Take a deep breath and take it all in. 

Luckily, the menu items are so ridiculously reasonably priced that you can afford to be a bit indecisive and order, say, a massive salad, a chicken sandwich, a hotdog, and a milkshake (although I certainly don&#39;t recommend eating all that at once). 

Truth be told, I feel like the food quality is really on par with a 3-star rating, but the kitschy, retro Chicago decor, super friendly staff, and fast food service bump up the overall rating. 

The salads are awesome and HUGE. Word to the wise, though: get the dressing on the side. They kind of drench it with the dressing. The BBQ chicken and chopped salads are both amazing options.

Sandwiches are just OK. The buns are a little wimpy, and there really isn&#39;t anything special about the sandwich itself. I&#39;m not a hot dog lover, per se, but that is what I&#39;d recommend over the chicken sandwich. My brother is quite partial to the combo beef and char-grilled sausage sandwich (it is MASSIVE).

Fries and onion rings are solid side choices (fries are super salty, though). And of course, no trip would be complete without a SHAKE. Portions are huge (my sister and I split a large and could barely get through half of it) and if you are feeling truly decadent (or if you need a gain a few pounds in a hurry and/or up your blood sugar level pronto), order the chocolate cake shake. I haven&#39;t tried it, but my brother loves it. It is what it sounds like: chocolate cake + a milkshake. Who comes up with these ideas?!

Portillo&#39;s, stay classy."

Portillos fries aren&#39;t stellar but they are good. And mine were consistent with past experiences. My Italian beef didn&#39;t have a lot of beef and only two sweet peppers. It seemed skimpy. I gave the chocolate cake shake a 3rd go, and I am realizing that I just don&#39;t get the hype on it. Portillos chocolate cake? Yep, the hype is warranted (by the way- if you are in Rockford area you may want to give Macianos chocolate cake a try. A close second to Portillos).

- I specifically ordered water, and was charged with buying a soda. I received a soda, which I didn&#39;t realize until I sat down. I promptly returned to the counter with my receipt, and requested a refund. Refund was given, and I was given the water I ordered originally. 

- Water cup I received exploded. The lid was not on tight, and when when I took a drink it spilled all over me. So, I pushed the lid down with minimal effort, and the cup burst open all over my food and the table. I returned ot the counter, again, and requested a replacement. Replacement was given at no cost to me.

- A slice of cheesecake that I ordered was $3-ish, and was of very low quality. Would not recommend.

Raking leaves in the fall, harsh winters, awesome summers by Lake Michigan, calling soda &#34;pop,&#34; rooting for the Cubs even though they never win.... there is nothing more quintessential and awesomely &#34;Chicago&#34; to me than Portillo&#39;s.

Everything on the menu is awesome! Some of their most favorite staples are in no particular order: Chopped salad, hot dogs, italian beef, hamburgers, cheese fries, milkshakes, chocolate cake, and chococlate cake shakes (yes thats right- Chocolate shake + cake! they take 2 awesomely chocolate things and make them one!)

Each location is a little bit different, this one seems to be a &#34;roaring 20&#39;s&#34; theme. 
The service is quick, reliable, and friendly at all of the locations. The prices are reasonable for the quality of food- Portillo&#39;s is &#34;fast food&#34; so don&#39;t think you are going to have a server. You walk in, order &amp; pay, then pick up and grab a table. 
It gets really crowded, especially around lunchtime. Luckily they seem to have the drive thru routine down to a science.

Overall first awful experience ever!

Out of the 4+ locations I&#39;ve been to I the quality of the food is always spot on, whether its an oily Italian Beef sandwich dripping to the point of falling apart with juicy goodness, or a classic Chicago styled hot dog with a fantastically soft poppy seed bun that has the perfect tug. This one is no different.

The one thing I think Portillo&#39;s has that isn&#39;t affirmed enough is the ambiance: every Portillo&#39;s I&#39;ve been to is decorated cleverly so you&#39;re transported out of the 21st century into the rustic American midwest, where the greasy Italian beef sandwich was (and still is) eaten alongside ragtime and big band music and checkered table cloths. Combined with the fact that all the ordering is done at the cash register, Portillo&#39;s is perfect for large or small groups who want a casual lunch/dinner, don&#39;t want to deal with waiters, and want to leave with their soul satisfied even though their arteries may not be (unless you get their salads, which are all tasty by the way.)  

In sum, Portillo&#39;s is always one of the first fast food places I turn to when I&#39;m in the mood for Chicago styled food, and this location was no different. 

***Also, dear tourists, the ketchup station is not for your hotdog. It is proper etiquette to the cooks to NOT slather your hot dog with sugar saturated, preservative infused tomato paste. That&#39;s for the fries."

We had an order brought in for lunch during an all-day meeting with one of our vendors whose offices are in Downers Grove. I had an Italian Beef with Extra Gravy and sweet peppers ($4.75. not sure on extra charge for peppers) and Onion Rings ($1.99).

I&#39;d asked for the Extra Gravy on the side, but the sandwiches weren&#39;t marked and the one I was handed was already doused (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3hdkwAIjaZGhP3SJ0Y4yVw?select=rtmy08bszYS-5o5DI_LkKA). I thought it was a good amount of thinly sliced, tender beef for the price (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3hdkwAIjaZGhP3SJ0Y4yVw?select=NuANhsryKVo3r4yx0lOqYw). The gravy definitely added to the overall flavor, but makes this a pretty messy thing to eat. Get extra napkins!

The onion rings were under seasoned and seemed like average food service grade. Same with the crinkle cut fries I tried.

Pretty good prices compared to what I see back in California. The Hot Dog, with all the standard Chicago style fixings, is $2.39 and a Maxwell St Polish is $3.59."

WHen my co-worker finds I am going, he says &#34;You gotta go to Portillo&#39;s!&#34; Order the Chicago Beef Sandwich with extra sweet peppers and dipped on both ends. Okay, I&#39;ll do just that. As luck would have it, there was a Portillo&#39;s less than two miles from my hotel.
The place was still busy at 8pm. There were FOUR live people manning the drive-through window. Actually going from car to car to speed up service. I walked in. I ordered the beef and a chicago dog to go. Had to have the dog. I love those things. I have had them all over the country, but they never seem to taste the same. They look the same, have the same ingredients, and have even been made by Chicago ex-pats; they just never seem to taste exactly right. 
I received my order in under three minutes. Got back to my hotel and the food was still hot. The dog was awesome! Just what I needed and only $2.75. The beef? Meh. I expected a little more unique flavor than basically what I have experienced with almost every French Dip sandwich I&#39;ve ever eaten. The beef was finely shaved roast beef with a mild au jus. I expected some Italian seasoning of some kind. Also, I may have had the wrong idea about what sweet peppers meant. I was expecting the sweet cherry peppers common in Italian sandwich shops. What I got were three big wedges of green bell pepper that were steamed or slow sauteed. That sandwich I could take or leave. If I go back, I will have to see if they have Gardinera to put on the sammie.
Obviously though, they are doing well. I loved the dog and they had me there."

I opted for the traditional Chicago dog with minor tweaks (no onion, no pickle) and a small Italian Beef. Also split a side of cheese fries with the GF.
Hot dog was full of flavor, with fresh toppings, and the steamed poppy seed bun set it off.
The Italian Beef was a solid offering that I would feel comfortable recommending, but it was far from the best I&#39;ve ever had.
The fries were hot, crispy, and perfectly seasoned. The ooey, gooey, cheese was a nice touch.

I would have to say I have never been let down here.  They always make sure they have your order correct, especially through the drive-thru.  I can honestly say that in 20 something years they have only forgotten something once, maybe twice...

It depends on your mood, but my usual is a hot dog with cheese fries and a chocolate malt.  YUM!   My husband really likes their burgers, and my parents&#39; love the Italian beef.  I am getting hungry just thinking about it!

There is normally always a line, inside or through the drive-thru, but it is so worth the wait.

Before I go into the specifics of the incident that has led me to write this immediately after I should probably go into some detail about what I&#39;ve noticed with Portillo&#39;s in general, not just this specific location. I&#39;ve observed that quality control has severely dropped off in the past seven or eight years. The way hot dogs, burgers, polishes and other items are made seem haphazard, you can get a dry patty burger or a juicy one. You can get a hot dog with waaay too much mustard and relish to a point that it&#39;s mushy or one made properly. Their consistency has been all over the place in the past few years. Back in the day Portilo&#39;s was the consistent four or five star fast food eatery that earned it the reputation it seems to still have among most Chicagoans, but the days of that consistency are long gone.

Now, on to the incident at hand. It&#39;s a Saturday evening and a decision was made to pick up two drive thru items at Portillo&#39;s being nearby, a Maxwell street Polish, and a grilled chicken croissant. The maxwell street polish appeared to be fine. However, the grilled chicken croissant (which is what I was having) was a different story. I pulled the Styrofoam container out and noticed something was below it in the bag, figuring it was probably just napkins or something I didn&#39;t investigate further. The lid on the container was tucked shut and I opened it up, took a bite and noticed that I had a croissant with only mayo and lettuce on the inside, no chicken. Upon further investigation into the bag I discovered the grilled chicken patty was just placed at the bottom of the bag, outside of not just the sandwich, but the container of the sandwich. 

Seriously Portillos&#39;? This is really the cherry on the sundae of crappy food I&#39;ve seen from Portillo&#39;s in the past few years. This puts the poor in Portillo&#39;s (that phrase works better if you say it aloud). While I may update this at a later point, I&#39;m giving the Downers Grove Portillo&#39;s only one star. All attention to quality has been forgotten here."

And I don&#39;t eat hot dogs at home. They just never taste the same. Maybe it&#39;s the steamed bun thing? I don&#39;t know. 

Anyway, as we all know, Portillos is everywhere. I&#39;ve got one around the corner from my house. I had one five minutes from my old office. New office? Yeah, within 5 minutes. 

I&#39;d never been to this location, and was immediately impressed with the double drive-thru lane. Unfortunately, my joy didn&#39;t last long, the double drive-thru is a wreck. People don&#39;t read, and end up in the wrong lines. I got my food and spent another 5 minutes waiting to get around the people who hadn&#39;t gotten their food yet. 

Fortunately, my disappointment turned right back around when I opened my bag-o-deliciousness. The fries were piping hot and crispy. My jumbo dog (really, I don&#39;t know why then even keep the regular on the menu, the jumbo is soooo much better!) was drug through the garden, just like I like it. This portillos does not skimp on the condiments like some other locations **cough cough Arlington heights**

You walk up to order at the counter and take a number to your seat. What was different at this place though was a server continues checking in after bringing your food. They were friendly and attentive. 

I can be nervous eating out since I&#39;m sensitive to several different foods,  follow the Paleo AIP diet, and am also gluten free. I didn&#39;t call ahead or ask very specific questions, they didn&#39;t bat an eye when I ordered a gluten free and dairy free salad with no pepper or seasonings. I didn&#39;t ask specifically about oils or seasonings on the meat, but felt I was pretty safe ordering the kale salad with salmon. Just asked them to leave off the nuts, cheese, and seeds. Then did oil and vinegar dressing at the table. The salmon didn&#39;t seem seasoned with pepper or any other obvious pre-marinade.

With a huge menu filled with many healthy and fresh options, Standard Market Grill always sounds like an appealing choice. 

I&#39;ve had burgers, sandwiches, salads, and my easy go-to Buddha Bowl with the addition of salmon. Everything has been worthy of a repeat order. Their sweet potato fries are simply the best. While most restaurants who serve sweet potato fries seem to only serve limp ones, theirs are addiction worthy. I never order my own since willpower is not my forte. --It&#39;s best to snag a few from a friend&#39;s plate since manners will keep my sweet potato fry eating in check. 

While the environment looks a little sterile with its stark modern lines, the sunlight that pours through the massive windows softens everything it touches.

It&#39;s has an upscale modern grill connected to a grocery store (similar to Trader Joe&#39;s only pricier).  I leave from there disappointed today from my choice to go there for breakfast, a choice I will likely not make in the future.  I ordered the biscuits and gravy with the sunny side up eggs, my husband- the omelet with fruit (substituted for the hashbrowns).  Aside from the waiter - service was a major issue.  Starting out the cashier seemed confused and couldn&#39;t answer a single question without consulting someone else - our questions were simple no brainer&#39;s (gravy on the side, replace hashbrowns for fruit, etc.) which clearly she wasn&#39;t trained to know the answer for in advance.  There was just a handful of people, yet it took several minutes for it to arrive at the table.  When it was delivered our food was cold &amp; my sunny side eggs were broken and running all over the plate. (my husband didn&#39;t send his back) I told the runner (that delivered the food) that the food was cold &amp; requested that it be remade as I&#39;m not one to accept this.  He took the plate and returned within a few minutes with the same plate (leaving the gravy), which as still cold and appeared to be slightly microwaved. He had to take the gravy back to be microwave it at a separate trip.  When the waiter came back we told him that this isn&#39;t acceptable - at that point I was so frustrated I simply wanted to leave.  After that the manager came to the table (after telling the waiter we didn&#39;t want to talk to her) and tried to pick up our check as compensation.  I quickly told her that wasn&#39;t the point and declined the offer.  I reminded her that in Naperville&#39;s competitive restaurant market service issues of this litany has brought many restaurants before it out of business - service is paramount and expected.  She proceed to make excuses that they have no plate warmers in their kitchen, that they just started service breakfast 6 or so weeks ago.  Again, not a valid excuse when I&#39;ve been in Standard Market multiple times with every table filled and not had those issues.  I&#39;ve given it three stars because the food is high quality and for the most part good.  However, the service issues for me will be a deal-breaker with future visits.  I&#39;m disappointed, because the food is for the most part on point, but service for me will trump that every time.  My suggestion is to hire a manager with experience - it seems that the staff&#39;s training is lacking.  Service is king in Naperville - especially when you can go a different restaurant every day for an entire year &amp; never hit the same one twice!  The restaurants that make it long-term in Naperville have mastered service first and foremost - coupled with good food and portion size.  I give it three stars because it&#39;s not been this way every time."

My wife and I visited last night, and this place is a circus. Upon ordering we noticed a customer actually in the kitchen! The guy was complaining about his food, and the staff let him back there, where he had his hands and arms on the serving station. It was crazy, and the staff were completely absorbed by the event, and paying no attention to the customers. 

The food- Uggh! the worst. I ordered a chimmichuri steak with potatoes. What I got was an overcooked piece of meat (worst cut possible), and a pound of green potatoes. Flavorless and terrible. My wife had a fairly uninspiring turkey burger.

We have noticed over the past several months that service level and quality is declining steadily there. At the end of the day, this place is a grocery store, and they need a lot of improvement in basic food preparation and restaurant operations."

So I&#39;ve gotten food from standard market grill on three different occasions now. Food has always been great. I have ordered the kids sliders and fries because it is a big enough portion for an adult, and I love them. I order them with sweet potato fries that come with delicious honey mustard sauce. On point with those. I&#39;ve also tried their Buddha bowl with steak and it is also absolutely delicious. 

My beef here is the drinks and how much they charge for how LITTLE you get also with the service* I&#39;ve had the past two times. 

My second visit I ordered a milkshake for $5 and it came in a smaller glass, which wasn&#39;t that big of a deal because I added a bunch of stuff to it and honestly smaller portions are better for you (contradicting their meal portions). Today I ordered a LARGE size of their strawberry banana juice and I got my cup, same size as the milkshake but it was HALF full. The girl bringing me the drink asked the one who poured it if it was correct, the girl who poured it rudely said &#34;that&#39;s how much they get&#34;. I would have stayed and asked to speak with a manager but I was already running late for work.

My advice: Skip the drinks and just order water with your food. Maybe get it to go as well, I&#39;ve had rude and snooty service two out of the three times I&#39;ve been there. But alas, I will be back to try more things on the menu."

I had the Salmon Burger with fries, and ordered the  OJ smoothy and it was the greatest smoothie to ever touch the surface of my taste buds.  The salmon burger gave me a feeling of optimum nourishment I&#39;ve never encountered in any dining experience in memory.  Hence, my body loved it!!!!!!!

The problem with The Standard Market Grill is their service. My family and I have been coming here for lunch since they opened, and each time we have come the service is always extremely slow. You wouldn&#39;t think that based on the amount of staff they have working all day, but it&#39;s true. When meals should take approximately 10 or so minutes to arrive at your table, they take closer to 20 or minutes. For a casual dining place, that is way too long. And if you&#39;re expecting refills on your drink, forget about it. You&#39;ll get your drink 10 min after you sit down and a server won&#39;t be back well after you&#39;re done eating. With how much they charge for a meal, it&#39;s unacceptable. I hope they fix that problem."

Standard Market Grill had the best ratings and all the positive reviews and pictures looked promising. Located next to the Standard Market, the grill is its restaurant offering fresh fare. I was expecting a full service restaurant and was surprised to see an ordering counter as soon as you walk in. There&#39;s a digital menu beyond the counter and to be honest, I was looking for more variety in brunch options. If I didn&#39;t want a sandwich or salad, it seemed my options were limited to one of two omelets, a breakfast burrito, or a Belgian waffle. I quickly decided on a hanger steak and mushroom omelet, which is exactly what it sounds like and is served with standard breakfast potatoes (diced potatoes mixed with onions and peppers) or fresh fruit. Choice of white bread, whole grain bread, or English muffin. Strawberry jam and butter on the side. We were given a buzzer, told to grab our waters from their water station, and find our seats. 

Now is time to note that I like the layout of the restaurant. There&#39;s an indoor dining area; a semi-outdoor dining area with views of the pond, high windows and a cozy fireplace, and an outdoor dining area with wooden chairs and large umbrellas. There&#39;s a sign in the center table directing you to place your buzzer there and we did as instructed. Shortly thereafter, a server appeared, grabbed our buzzer from us, and assured us our food would be out soon. We waited only a short time and our food arrived. 

My omelet was fluffy and well-seasoned, with bits of hanger steak and mushroom through the egg instead of inside the omelet itself. I&#39;m not a huge meat person, but I think they could have definitely been more generous with the steak, especially at $9 for the omelet. Perhaps there was even an adequate amount of meat in my omelet and I just couldn&#39;t tell because it was chopped up and mixed with the egg and mushroom. The potatoes were heavily seasoned, and the onions and peppers gave it more flavor. The English muffin was also delicious, and I appreciated the fresh butter and strawberry jam.

After delivering our food, our server did not come back to check on us and didn&#39;t seem to be anywhere near the patio area, which makes me very confused on what level of service Standard Market Grill is trying to achieve. I do not mind ordering at the counter or picking up my own drink, but then I would expect a classy place like this would offer more service than a greeting and food delivery. Overall the food is good; I&#39;m not impressed with the brunch selections but I look forward to coming back and giving lunch or dinner a shot."

This particular restuarant takes advatange of the fast casual trend and provides a great place to get a meal on the side of a Trader Joe&#39;sish type of a grocery store.  The place is beatiful and open with tons of places to sit.  The one thing I will have to comment on is that they are a little slow to clear down tables, as one was left dirty for quite sometime into the meal.  While I&#39;m on the downsides, their draft beer list is on a rotating screen and the person at the counter taking the order had no clue what beers were being offered.


Outside of that the food and beer selection was pretty fantastic. I ended up getting the BLAT.  It had tons of crisp bacon, nice toasted brioche bread and creamy avocado.  All things considered it is a nice location and one I would likely return to."

The atmosphere matches the feel of the grocery store and is clean and updated.

The service is very nice.  Although you order up front and sit down to wait for your food, the rest of the experience is like a full service dining establishment.  The staff is friendly and very helpful.

Got the Buddha bowl and no ginger peanut sauce...instead they gave me a yellow mustard- mayo sauce X 2. Hangar steak salad for $14 was literally like an appetizer and sadly not great.

Sure, the grocery store is nice as well, but the restaurant really takes the cake. The grocery store prices have niche items, so if I needed a specific ingredient and couldn&#39;t find it at a specialty store closer to me, I could probably look here. But, kind of out of my budget right now. The restaurant fits nicely within our budget, though. They have cucumber water and watermelon water, so that&#39;s free also. 

My husband ordered a chicken sandwich with chicken, cheese, and bacon. He orders a sandwich no other way. He liked it. He also had a bowl of chicken tortilla soup. He said it was good, but it was literally just chicken and tortilla chips. Usually there is some corn, tomatoes, beans, etc. in the soup, but not in this one. It was more of a chicken chili. Also, it came with tortilla chips on top..and a dinner roll...and packaged oyster crackers..so carb heaven.

I ordered the veggie burger and I can confirm that it is not just a Morningstar or Boca burger patty. I asked and they do make them daily. Granted, I&#39;m sure that&#39;s a given, but it seems like most restaurants just use frozen patties. Anyway, it was delicious and I would order it again. Maybe without the BBQ sauce (I&#39;m just not a super BBQ fan). I did like the buttermilk garlic, though. 

And the fries...oh. the fries. Delicious. Freshly made and really, really good. If you&#39;re trying to be healthy and order a salad, good for you. The fries are worth it.

Only downside is the seating. There needs to be a wall separating the ordering line from the booths. Otherwise, we had people watching us the entire time we ate. And maybe a better system for seating people. There were people walking in and saving tables so that by the time we ordered, there was only one table open. 

This is definitely a place to which we will return."

The grocery store alone is tremendous, but my lunch at the Grill took me over the top. We had the grass fed burger with white cheddar cheese, tomato bacon jam, kale slaw, and red onion on a pretzel roll. I ordered it medium and it came out light pink in the middle and juicy. The jam was quite strong, but I liked how the raw onion cut the flavor. And you can&#39;t go wrong with a pretzel roll. 

I also had the mustard honey chicken sandwich. Pretzel batard, grilled chicken, Monterey Jack cheese, roasted red pepper, bacon, avocado, Bibb lettuce, red onion, mustard-honey. Everything just came together perfectly. I&#39;d order it again for sure.

And the sides are great. The market side salad as these soft cornbread croutons. There is no crouton anywhere near as good as these. And it&#39;s true, get the sweet potato fries. Incredibly thick, nicely seasoned, and a good honey-mustard dipping sauce. I want some chicken fingers for that mustard!!!

The Arnold Pomer was a really good drink; it&#39;s basically an Arnold Palmer with pomegranate juice. Very refreshing and refills are free. And there are no salt and pepper shakers. They give you a grinder that has coarse salt on one end and peppercorns on the other. You grind either side, so both the salt and pepper are as fresh as can be. Awesome. And the service was really good, everybody was very friendly. 

For a casual place, the ingredients are top notch and the menu is unique and creative while being approachable. Definitely will return."

The Super 7 with grilled salmon was excellent, and I was impressed with the craft beer selection on tap.  I&#39;ll definitely be back to walk through the market area, which definitely looks to give Whole Foods or Mariano&#39;s some stiff competition.

It is a really casual, chill, and warm atmosphere that serves GREAT food. The service is good. No memorable, but good. Especially since the menu options are on display on the wall and over the cash register. That&#39;s what makes it more casual than it could be, but if it is attached to a grocery store in the &#39;burbs, what would you expect? No Maitre D&#39; in this place, and that&#39;s OK.

Starting with the appetizers, I always order the chicken tortilla soup. It is VERY heart, full of generous pulled chicken pieces. It has a &#39;bite&#39; to it, like they added a spice that doesn&#39;t make it burn on the way down, but defintely reminds you of it&#39;s heat potential with a spicy aftertaste.MMMMM....Each time I indent to oder a cup, I default to the bowl size and end of waxing it off. Minus the tortilla strips added to the meal, it&#39;s one of the healthier meal choices you can make in this place, especially if you are among for a gluten-free meal. Here is the bonus: If you don&#39;t finish your soup and take some home in a doggy bag, Day old soup is the BEST!

Order the sweet potato fries over the regular fries...You can&#39;t get good fried at many restaurants in the area, but a generous portion of well seasoned sweet potato fries are far and few between. One side of this is too much for one person - definitely sharing size.

The kale slaw is an interesting version of their original cole slaw. I enjoyed both. When I am nutrient-conscious, I&#39;ll order the kale. It&#39;s a bit tangier. When I don&#39;t give to farts on what goes into my body, and I want a calorie rich meal, enter the coleslaw...it is very tasty.

Believe it or not, you can make a complete meal with the appetizers alone. That&#39;s how a control my portion size and $ when dining.

The grass-fed burger is really good. It&#39;s well cooked and worth paying the premium for a burger in this establishment. I&#39;ll put it on the same level as Ted&#39;s Montana restaurant. Thats says a lot about the quality of the food. Trust me...I am a man who &#39;knows his meat&#39;.....wait, that didn&#39;t sound right....

The asian chicken salad is HUGE and tasty. Huge and crappy is never good. Huge and memorable - always better. They don&#39;t drench the salad in dressing, which is what i personally prefer. The portion size is a full entree itself, and maybe shareable (depends who you are with, I guess). 

Being on/off on a paleo diet, this restaurant is paleo friendly. For those gluten-free crossfit gym rats out there,"

The market has a variety of culinary pleasures including HOOK&#39;S aged cheddar.  Lots of items you wont even find at WF though I found the prices to be comparable.  

It lost one star due to how small it is, imagine how much more stuff you could fill in here if the place was bigger.  Moving along, you can find helpful staff and pre-bagged dinners, with fresh ingredients to make dinner/lunch yourself OR you can pick up pre-made.  I believe there are different meals depending on the day of the week.  The day we went they had a pre-bagged steak dinner and pre-packaged knuckle rolls (lobster salad sammies) YUM. 

As we moseyed around we saw people drinking wine next to the cheese counter area, will have to come back to check that out.

Last, the GRILL.  We opted to sit outside because the weather was perfect and started with the chicken tortilla soup which was excellent.  We shared, the Pulled Pork Pizza, the Molten Grilled Cheese, a side of hand cut fries and Kale Slaw.  All were fantastic.  

Everything from start to finish was tasty, we will definitely be back again, and again, and again.  :)"

The staff is the best of the best. Extremely professional and courteous and so good at what they do. And they do it well. I have been to the Westmont Standard Market Grill.

Or Whole Foods, if you have no soul.

The grill is OK, again due to the pricing.  My wife and I paid $60 for two entrees, a few sides, and a few drinks.  Not great.  Food quality was good, but due to the pricing alone, it makes it seem less than great."

I try not to go too often, because it is on the expensive side, but it is a great if you are shopping for a special occasion or something out of the ordinary.

They have a great selection of meats, including lots of preseasoned/marinated options.

They also have a really impressive coffee selection.

The wine bar is a nice place to relax for a bit after an afternoon of running errands. You can even buy a bottle in the store and drink it there with no cork fee."

I ordered the pesto chicken sandwich, it was really good. My fianc√© ordered the Cuban chicken sandwich, which he enjoyed as well. My moscow mule was off though, very lemony. It just didn&#39;t seem right. 

Our service was a little less then average. We sat at the bar so we were up close to all of the action. It was very busy, but just sitting next to two working the bar we didn&#39;t get asked about drinks for about 10 minutes. Being at the bar, and I n front of all of the workers in the 45 minutes we were there we witnessed 3 meals being refunded.

My over all impression was that yes it was busy, however I feel like I saw lots of confusion with workers. I think if it was more like an average restaurant where you sit down and order (which I was very surprised when I realized you ordered at the counter) then the workers would be less confused and wouldn&#39;t wander around the entire place with found searching for the right table."

Its actually kind of a small store considering the way the building looks but it also has a restaurant/grill attached. Anyway you can kind of expect whole food prices when you walk through the door, but in my opinion better products. This place doesn&#39;t try to shove everything in your face like other places nor do they overstuff there sleeves. Also the cafe place is really nice. Kind of small but they make an amazing matcha latte and chai tea... I didn&#39;t get the chance to try the coffee yet but I&#39;m sure I will be back to do so....

We also had the four farmers salad which was full of fresh and tasty ingredients, but that didn&#39;t get finished because we were distracted by their amazing french fries. Hand cut, with some skin left on, and the right amount of salt. Not greasy either. Just perfect. I had a $5 margarita because it was on special. Drink prices were a little high given how casual the restaurant is and the location, IMO.  My husband said he really enjoyed his sandwich and that he would totally come back here.

If you like the sweeter tasting salads that have goat cheese, avocado, fruit and nuts, this is your salad.  They mix the dressing into the salad perfectly!  I was thinking about it all day today and wondering when I will get my next Four Farmers salad. Good portion size, too!  Well worth the $12.  I felt it was more of a value than the sandwich I got there the first time.

I enjoy this restaurant.  It&#39;s clean, contemporary.  I like the bar area that overlooks the open kitchen area.  

I like the flavored water stations that you can help yourself to.  

They will bring you little samples of their chocolate cookie bars.  Mine were hot out of the oven and really good.

It&#39;s basically the perfect meal, for me.

The price is right, too, since it&#39;s about $12 (with tax) for the chicken Buddha bowl, and you get a large portion that&#39;s presumably made with higher quality ingredients than most places use.

I *really* don&#39;t like that they don&#39;t provide nutritional information. I looked everywhere I could think to look, and still have no idea how many calories, how much sodium, etc. is in their food.

I went there Sunday bc I enjoy this chia teas. My husband brought me my drink. It tastes like dirty dish water and was disgusting. I brought it back and complained about how wrong it tasted. The girl behind the counter said she could make me a new one but it would take a few minutes to make the chia. We were in a hurry so I had to get the receipt to make the return.

Deli 

This is a Chef driven business so everything seems to be pretty top choice^_^ almost everything is top quality with almost no artificial preservatives/additives. Prices are similar to a Whole Foods, so it may seem a bit pricey but this day and age we end up having to pay a little more for REAL food as opposed to over processed, mass consumer items. I&#39;m the kind of person who tries to save money where I can, but when it comes to what I put into my body I will pay a little more to put good stuff into it. 
Not to mention it tastes better ;))
*gluten free options available in grocery store &amp; at restaurant
 
Ps the sweet potato fries are amazing &amp; my BF worships the bacon hahaha :)~ 

Sandwhiches we tried we delicious! We had the *24 steak &amp; BLAT (with Swiss cheese &amp; egg added). The steak was perfectly done so you didn&#39;t have to rip at it through your sandwich. The Swiss cheese on my BLAT went perfectly with the fried egg (I added both of those).

I ordered the Mediterranean Salad and it was one of the top three salads I have ever had - absolutely delicious!  It comes with grilled salmon, balsamic dressing, field greens, Campari tomatoes, focaccia croutons, cucumber, feta, and Kalamata olives.  The salmon was perfectly seasoned and cooked - tender and not overdone.  The dressing was sweet and had the right amount of bite from the balsamic vinegar.  Everything tasted fresh and was cut in small pieces for dainty eating.  I could not put my fork down, lol.

I also enjoyed the flavored waters - not sure what was in mine, haha.  Maybe labels might be helpful?...  ;)

Now when I walked into this fine establishment on this fine day and observed the fine menu board rich with options, I was blinded by my previous experience. I ordered the Brunch Burger, a delicacy by my standards, and my amigo ordered the Brisket Grilled Cheese. I had been resting in the booth with my good friend when after an extended period of time my friend had his meal and I was still waiting for my glorious sandwich. I had to go say something to the server and finally I had the beloved burger in front me. Considering the quality of food served here, I had high hopes that have never been disappointed before. You would think frying an egg is a simple task, but it seems the chefs that day had it out for my immune system (as in salmonella, which is rampant uncooked eggs). As for my friends brisket grilled cheese, it was less than satisfactory. He considers himself a connoisseur of brisket having eaten and enjoyed it for many years (he&#39;s pretty old but that&#39;s just between you and me). As I enjoyed my bacon and burger (minus the egg) I periodically looked over at him taking large slices of fat off of his grilled cheese. While I am no professor of brisket according to him this is one of the worst sins possible in meats. Over half of the brisket were large pieces of fat. With the combination of the poor service, and the lackluster elements of the food, Standard Market Grill was not up to standard"

It is a market with a grill/restaurant attached.   A very very high priced market, actually overpriced in many areas.  But it has some interesting options.  The &#34;dinner for two&#34; appears to be a good deal coming in at around $18.00, including a salad, entree, vegetable/starch and dessert.  everything I put my hands on was expensive to me... unnecessarily so in many instances.  I think the market caters to a different kind of ego that could care less about how much something costs.  That&#39;s okay, just turns me off. Obviously the meat counter is phenomenal, but I can do better at Caputo&#39;s. The cheese and wine selection is large and varied, top of the line.  The Grill is a nice option for lunch.  It has an attractive bar, replete with a lot of craft beers.  They make a good steak sandwich, and the fries are great.  That&#39;s all I had so far along with an excellent craft beer.  They try to take very very good care of you but customer service is sketchy, which is surprising.  It&#39;s a nice experience, and I will go back just out of curiosity, or to pick up dinner for two.  I would definitely do lunch at the Grill again.  Not much more to say, but I will probably do another review at a later date...maybe my opinion will change.  Do they have a Red Box?"

I&#39;ve been to the Grill several times for a lunch and I absolutely love when I dine in. The food is amazing. I&#39;ve always had a burger and haven&#39;t gone wrong yet. The music is great - like they are playing my favorite Pandora station. They also have an amazing water bar. And to top things off the server brings over a warm cookie bar. I love this place. The only downside is, every time I order my food to go it is never quite as good as when I dine in. 
One major thing - please bring back the original kale topping on the burgers. It was fantastic. The most recent burger I had, had a different topping (not as great)."

Service is pretty good too. My only complaint would be that the lighting at night is pretty dim.

It certainly had a &#34;mystery meat&#34; quality to it, because I had to spit out 2 bones during the course of my meal.  Plus, the meat was pretty oily.  It also didn&#39;t help that there was a handwritten sign on the window with the word &#34;Birria&#34; on it, which is a stew traditionally made from goat or mutton (sheep).  So I know there are weird meats in the kitchen.

On top of that, while the cashier was friendly, the cooks glared at me when I walked in and when I was paying.  I prefer to have my food made by someone who doesn&#39;t have an imaginary grudge against me or the world.

Needless to say, I was thinking about heading to the toilet to puke it all back up when I was done with my meal.  I will not be returning.

That said, I&#39;ve always liked the location on Ogden near Naper Blvd in Lisle.  I know the older manager guy with the bad eye takes his work very seriously and makes a good burrito.  I even called to complain once because I thought it was not meaty enough and he told me to come back for one on the house."

In warmer weather their porch is perfect.  It overlooks the Fox River and the bike path.   They have great Spanish/Mexican influenced breakfast staples.  My absolute favorite are the Enchilada Breakfast Crepes.  Their Mexican omelets and eggs benedict are delicious too.  Portion sizes are hefty for the small price tag.  Their hash-browns are a must as well.  They always come out super crispy which is how I like them.

We got to try their famous French toast and omelette. Not only was the food amazing but the prices are very reasonable. Our total tab was only $20 for two people and we got two entr√©es coffee &amp; soda. Our server was very friendly and very patient with us while we asked her questions about the establishment and food. It is a hard place to find and you could miss it if you drive by it so try this place out and you won&#39;t regret it and try to get a seat outside and enjoy the view of the river!

Had lunch here today and I was not impressed. I had the chicken sandwich which was just okay. It wasn&#39;t awful but it wasn&#39;t anything spectacular. My fries tasted like frozen fries that were popped in the oven. They were cold in the center.

The place itself was pretty dirty. Lots of cobwebs...maybe it was decor for Halloween. The waitress was nice but not very attentive. I asked for extra napkins for the table and she only brought me one. There were four of us at the table. Should I have just split the napkin? 

I would not come back to this place. The lack of cleanliness was a turnoff."

They have a lot in the way of vegetables and fruits in the menu items, which is greatly appreciated.  One of us almost always orders something with avocado, and another fav is choosing one of their home-made breads made as french toast - most recently it was their banana bread french toast, with fresh sliced bananas and pecans over the top, with sausage links, and eggs for eight bucks...tough to beat that quality or price around here.

My husband and I went there this past Friday, other than the two of us there was one other table.  My husband and I always pass this place on our bike ride along the fox river and have been wanting to try it so we finally had the chance.  I don&#39;t know what the inside looks like since we walked straight onto the deck and were seated.  The deck was nice and I thought we were going to have an enjoyable breakfast... I was wrong!  

It all started when I asked for a tomato juice with a lemon and was served a glass of tomato juice that tasted like a tin can and a lemon that looked like it was sitting on the counter for two days (dry and old).  It was 10am so it was an old, old lemon slice not sliced that morning for certain.   I told the waitress the juice did not taste right and instead of asking if I wanted something else I was told she just opened the can and it was fresh, and that it is fine.   Needless to say I said I would be fine with water.

When I went to order I asked if the bacon was made fresh and was told &#34;that all the people love their bacon&#34;  I asked again if it was made fresh or if it was bought premade and just heated and was told &#34;yes&#34;.  I skipped the bacon and just asked for two eggs, hash browns, and toast.  

As my breakfast was served I took one bite of my hash browns and when I went for a second bite a short black hair was in the hash browns.  I put it to the side and planned to skip the hash browns and just eat the eggs and toast.  I wasn&#39;t going to say anything given I had just complained about the juice and lemon and didn&#39;t want to be difficult. BUT As I cut into the eggs and placed it on my fork the egg turned upside down and on the backside of the egg was two more short black hairs.  At this time I had enough and brought it to the wait staffs attention.  I was met with an argumentative response with her telling me they were not hair that they were potato&#39;s.  I told her I know what hair looks like andI also cook and know what a potato looks like.  She insisted that they were not hairs and that the cook wears a hair net!  It was crazy!   She then backed off her explanation that they were potato&#39;s but still insisted they weren&#39;t hairs.  I told her since she can&#39;t tell me what they are, and they are not food, I don&#39;t want the entree.  After many times of her telling me they weren&#39;t hairs she asked if I wanted another order.  I told her I would not.  

My husband was afraid to eat his dish but didn&#39;t want to cause more issues so ate.  He said his dish was not a good dish to judge the place on because it was a healthy egg beaters breakfast sandwich was very tasteless and dry but he attributes that to it being healthy.  

I would never go back!"

Ordered the bacon bbq cheeseburger meal with tater tots.

I was was disappointed. The burger was tasty and somewhat juicy regardless. Good bun too. They also forgot to drop my tater tots that arrived at my table perfectly cooked a few minutes later.

Excellent customer service and my food was delicious. I stopped in after collecting coupon after coupon from the Cougars games. This location just recently opened up and it&#39;s the nearest to me. I got gas at the gas station, checked out the liquor store and then bought my lunch. 

The menu has apps, sides, wings,burgers, sandwiches and salads. My coupon was buy a main and make it a meal for free. After much thought taking in the menu, I settled on the BLT. It has avocado on it, which caught my eye. I got it on wheat bread, which they toasted just right and plenty of fresh lettuce and tomato plus a gentle amount of mayo, the avocado and the main star of the sandwich, the bacon! It was perfectly done, just thick enough and in between crispy and chewy. The sandwich was top notch. I chose tater tots as my side, who doesn&#39;t love tater tots!?!?!? These were crunchy and potatoey. Yum! Finally, I got a diet coke. It rivals McDonald&#39;s quality. It came from a small version of those computerized soda machines, and it had the exact amount of carbonation needed for a quality pop. 

I loved my experience. I will go back, I just hope I can try something new, but the BLT is calling my name."

The reviews of the Aurora location impressed me and once I saw a positive review posted for this location, I decided to give Urban Counter a try.

It is located right next to the BP gas station at Bricher &amp; IL Route 38. I&#39;m sure at some point I will combine feeding me and feeding my car into one trip.

I&#39;m a simple basic kind of guy and I like the style of this place. Not fancy or pretentious. Functional sort of industrial-looking furniture. Could see the grill from the counter. I made a take-out order, and it took maybe 5-6 minutes from placing my order to it being ready. I didn&#39;t time it. Yes, it took longer than McDonald&#39;s/BK/Wendy&#39;s, but I got a better product that was made-to-order and wasn&#39;t thrown together. Worth the wait.

For my first visit, I went with the Bacon Burger and a regular-sized order of fries. The burger was very good. The thick half-pound patty comes with bacon, barbecue sauce, onion rings, cheddar, and roasted jalapenos. As I was eating it, I had forgotten about the jalapenos and was wondering where the spicy kick came from. They were a nice touch. Better than the raw pickled jalapenos you might get on a burger elsewhere. Sauce was good, onion rings were good. The bacon didn&#39;t overwhelm the burger. The flavors were balanced. The burger was well-constructed. I was worried such a big burger might fall apart and be a mess to eat, but it all stayed together right down to the last bite.

There were two things I liked about the hand-cut fries. They were lightly salted with a larger-grained salt. So many places oversalt their fries so badly that my tongue feels assaulted. Not with these fries. They were a nice change. I also liked that the fries weren&#39;t limp and greasy. One Italian beef place I used to go to sells hand-cut fries that are so greasy and go totally limp if you don&#39;t eat them in 5 minutes. Urban Counter&#39;s fries were still nice and crispy after a 10-minute car ride.

I&#39;ve been wanting a place where I can grab a good burger for lunch that&#39;s a step up from the usual fast food places, offers good value, and has the kind of ambiance/convenience I like. I think Urban Counter is it, and I look forward to trying the rest of the menu."

The behind the counter could use some help. The sweet potato fries are mushy ( like the Fryer fat wasn&#39;t hot enough) and some were so dried out that they seemed burned. The Choc shake was like wipped milk with chocolate, not creamy thick. 
Not sure why the cup for the milkshake said &#34; Pride&#34; on it. Are they owned by the Pride wine store next door or did they just run out of plastic cups? The people at the register seem tired and the people at the grill frustrated. The burgers are good. 
The biggest problem is that they close at 7pm on Friday and Saturday nights! When we were there Saturday 3 people walked in a couple minutes after 7 because no one locked the door, and they told them sorry they were closed! This place won&#39;t last unless they get a clue!

The waiter, despite the noise level which was very loud and his accent which sometimes was hard to understand was still awesome.  I ordered the meat skillet, it was really good, the wife ordered the waffles, which I tasted and it was pretty good.  My skillet came with a muffin which was toasted but limp and soggy.

We easily found street parking but there is a parking garage down the street if you don&#39;t mind walking a little bit. We got seated right away and were told of the specials.

I ordered a grapefruit juice with the San Antonio skillet, sunny side up. My friend got the orange juice with the special skillet (it had red bell pepper and yams?). We also shared a pancake that was free with check in on yelp!

I thoroughly enjoyed my skillet. Everything was yummy about it. I really liked the English muffin that came with the skillet. It was perfectly toasted and the blueberry sauce that came with it was fresh and delicious. My grapefruit juice had pulp and tasted very fresh. The pancake was fluffy and I put the remaining blueberry sauce on the pancake. It was a huge portion and I still had about half leftover, which makes a delicious lunch!

Overall, service was excellent and for the value, it is totally worth it. A little over $30 for brunch for two! I will definitely come back since I only live 5 minutes away."

My turkey bacon was cold and soggy.  The French toast was luke warm and we could barely cut.  Needless to say we were very disappointed.  We have gone to various egg harbors including this one over the years.  However, after this experience we will not be going back with so many breakfast options out there.

Egg Harbor feeds this addiction more than I like to admit, especially with a toddler and infant now in tow. A family friendly atmosphere with quick service and an expansive menu makes everyone happy! It does get busy on the weekends but the waits goes quickly and certainly isn&#39;t bad when you can wait in beautiful weather outside.

The usual breakfast items are available as well as amped up versions depending on your mood. Plain whole wheat pancakes, blueberry, pumpkin, Boston cream?!? Each season brings new delights!

My personal favorites include the Sir Dugan Frittata, you can&#39;t go wrong with bacon and eggs, or Cassie&#39;s Crepes, an enticing crepe bursting with fresh avocado, mushrooms, egg, and cheese served with creamy poppyseed dressing- amazing!

The kids menu is also expansive. Our little guy loves the pancakes, waffles, and sausage. It also come with a drink. The coloring sheets and children&#39;s books make the short wait for food even more manageable.

Be sure to check the specials board when you walk in or ask your server. From Mom&#39;s leftover Thanksgiving skillet to cornbread french toast, a hidden delight might be coming your way!"

This place totally fit the bill and satisfied my craving for a good brunch. 
First off, they have an option for turkey sausage and turkey bacon which is HUGE because I don&#39;t eat pork. The turkey options were actually well seasoned and delicious as well. 
I started with the flavored coffee - cinnamon hazelnut. Wow. Yum. 
I had the cheese grits with eggs. Eggs were cooked perfectly. Grits cooked well - LOTS of cheese on top and the other toppings, jalape√±os, turkey bacon, onions - so flavorful. 
My husband had the oatmeal with berries - again, great texture. 

This place is really great for brunch. If I lived near Downers, I would totally go back. I wold love to try some of the pancake or french toast dishes - which sounded like dessert but looked great."

Our server was extremely pleasant and welcoming, and very attentive throughout our breakfast.

We sat outside in the patio seating early on a Sunday morning. The sunny morning helped, but it&#39;s a beautiful place to sit and enjoy breakfast. I also really like how they leave a sizable pitcher of water (with a lid, of course!) out on the table. This gave us more than enough water to drink throughout the meal and lessened the need for staff to come out and refill anything. 

The reason it would be 4.5 and not 5 for me is because the least exciting part of my visit was the food. I ordered a meaty skillet, but the taste of the skillet was rather dry and overwhelmed by the onions cooked with the meat. I think the onions are a necessary part of the dish, but I was hoping for the egg and meat to dominate the flavor. I will try different items on return visits, hoping to find a go-to dish. The English muffin served with the skillet was very good.

My girlfriend was pleased with her order of the special French toast, and said her coffee was also delicious.

Overall, the service is absolutely top notch, and the ambience is great. Go sit outside on a sunny day and enjoy the weather and good food!"

The service was awful. We were there on a busy day, Veteran&#39;s Day, but it wasn&#39;t packed. There was a very short wait. Main thing is that not all items I ordered made it to the table and what I ordered as an appetizer was not brought out until my entire meal was ready and served. We had two different waitresses. It was annoying. If ever at this mall again I will eat here because they offer gluten free options, but that is about the only reason I will continue to go. Salad was wilted.

She was so dedicated to bring us quality service, along with her colleagues. The fact that she resembles Julia Roberts only enhances her excellent personality. 

We were seated immediately upon entering the restaurant. Literally, within seconds, Caroline was at our table taking orders for beverages. There were so many items available, I almost changed my usual iced tea selection, but reneged on alternatives. Then, she returned a few moments later, taking our orders for food.

We had spent a very stressful morning waiting for my son to get out of surgery, so once he was in his room resting somewhat comfortably, we left his bedside and chose to dine at Egg Harbor Cafe. 

Four of us in our party were very pleased with what was served. The drinks were refilled continuously, and cold beverages got little carafes left on our table. 

All of us enjoyed what we ordered to eat, but the customer service really blew us away with how they were involved with our dining experience. Not only did the manager make several appearances, but Caroline, our server, was top-notch! I liked the fact that she gave us take-out cups for our beverages, so that we could enjoy refreshments long after leaving the facility.

I received a gift card to this resturant through my employer who gave them out to myself and the 30 other staff members.  The manager was unable to run my card due to THEM switching companies they use for their gift cards.  She told me she would check it out later and call me with the amount and mail a new card out. I had to call a few times to get in touch with someone then received a very unprofessional voice-mail saying &#34; there&#39;s no money on your card you tried to use sorry bye.&#34; This to me says they don&#39;t want to take the time to get in touch with the old card issuer and issue a new one and mail it out. I know for a fact there is money on the card because my other Co workers have used theirs. This was not my fault and an ussue on their end because of their new system. I drove all the way out to downers grove from mokena to try this place out and I sadly won&#39;t return or recommend to friends who live in the DG area.

We are professional people and didn&#39;t want to create a scene, and we thought for sure they&#39;d lop a small percentage off the bill or give us a complimentary dessert or something. Yet, alas, no. The phoney waitress quickly gave us our bill and ran off, and guess what, she got stiffed by us. Zero tip. We paid the bill and left with no fanfare and have vowed never to dine here again. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I lived in the city of Chicago for 22 years and cock roaches are a common thing, but it&#39;s the principle of the matter. Obviously, they don&#39;t value their customers very much here and that&#39;s probably true for their employees, too. The people operating this location are real losers."

I am mad at myself for taking such a long time to finally dine in. Immediately upon entering the door I was greeted, no waiting, no lines the host was friendly.  I love the fact the server leaves the water craft and coffee on the table, I am in total control of my refills. Oh and great up sell on your caramel coffee of the day mister server, your energy sold me on it.

I ordered the ulitmate skillet with ham, mushrooms, onions, green peppers, tomato.
Topped with just the appropiate amount of jack and cheddar cheese. This all rested on a bed of seasoned harbor potatoes....superb!!!

Most breakfast places ask you if you would like Toast or Pancakes with your skillet. I was impressed that my server read my mind and suggested the English Muffin. Oh yeah bring it! The english muffin came buttered and with a side of jelly for dipping. That&#39;s right I said dipping, none of that on the table and peal back condiment jelly. It was fresh.

Quick service with a dynamite vibe is why I will be back more often. Oh and if you don&#39;t like eggs with your skillet, fresh fruit may be substituted."

Eggs Benedict was lukewarm and accompanying hash browns were lukewarm and soggy.  Our extra order of pancakes was forgotten, then brought to the table but not the correct pancakes.  It seems like Egg Harbor has gone the easy route and no longer prepares fresh food--they must just be heating up food made elsewhere.

Parking for this location is a bit tricky since it is in the heart of downtown Downers Grove, but the village parking garage is nearby if you can&#39;t find a parking space on the street. The train station is across the street, so if you arrived by train. Voila!

An Egg Harbor Cafe is not the place to relax and have a quiet chat when it&#39;s busy. (Aren&#39;t they always busy?) The tables are close together, there are large groups, families with small children, and staff with carpet sweepers right at your feet. The tables are small for the number of people and amount of food crammed onto them. I wouldn&#39;t call the seating comfortable.

So why go here? Well sometimes you want a breakfast that really should be classified as dessert. Or sometimes you want a breakfast made up of the five major food groups: meat, meat, meat, eggs, and cheese. Or sometimes you&#39;re like me and you want Cassie&#39;s Crepes; a strange but delicious combo of crepes filled with scrambled eggs, avocado, mushrooms, cheese &amp; topped with poppyseed dressing. Most people seem to find something here they like. Most of my friends and family can agree on Egg Harbor when they can&#39;t agree on other places to eat. And, this is big, the coffee is decent ... and it keeps coming.

If it were dinnertime I&#39;d hate a place like this, but despite the clatter, chatter, and crowding this place works for me for breakfast out. It&#39;s a solid choice. We especially like to meet friends here after visiting the Farmers Market on summer Saturday mornings."

When we arrived (Wednesday, around 11:00am), the place was packed. We decided to sit outside because it was just so loud and noisy inside. The hostess kindly and nicely seated us outside. What threw me off is when our server was a no show for 20 min. I had to go back inside the restaurant and ask for our server. He came shortly right after that and everything went smooth right after that. I also felt that the servers just looked sweaty and very in a hurry. They were all speed walking from table to table. I feel that that this place probably needs to increase the amount off staff &amp; come up with a better communication system so that customers don&#39;t get forgotten outside ever again.

All the food is really good too.  The decor of the restaurant is really quaint and cute.

The only drawback is they can sometimes get really croweded for brunch time on the weekends, but you just have to plan ahead for that.  I usually call before I leave home to see how long the wait will be."

This Egg Harbor Cafe is off of Mochel (a brand new street east of new Arcadia on the Green building, which in turn is just south of the Metra station downtown downers grove).  

Head east on Curtis (one way) and you will see Mochel on the left.  The Egg Harbor cafe is at the corner of Burlington and Mochel.


My wife and I tried this place out on a Friday Morning.  I appreciated the decent selection of Mexican inspired breakfast dishes (like Chiliquilies, Huevos Rancheros, and a Mexican skillet).  I ended up ordering a Mexican my wife went with a combo plate (pancake, egg, sausage).

The food was pretty good, though not amazing - basically another chain breakfast restaurant.  The service, food, and restaurant reminded me of a LePeep&#39;s variation.  I like LePeeps (and as such Egg Harbor) but not enough to drive out of my wife.  I will take a nice long drive to Bongo Room - but not Egg Harbor.

The only &#34;really&#34; bad part of our experience was our waitress.  With almost no one in the restaurant (Friday AM not a busy day) she just wasn&#39;t there for us.


I give it a 3/5 - nothing special, but nothing bad!"

I had to laugh - to myself of course. I would never laugh at the waitress. They must be on a mission to provide excellent customer service. Well it worked. The food came out fast and the service was friendly.

I had chilaquilles. The portion was huge..for me anyway. I only ate half because tortilla chips cooked in salsa gets super soggy really fast. I got it with chicken (never found it with chicken in a Mexican restaurant). The chicken looked and tasted like the precooked strips you buy in the grocery store that are supposed to save you time.

It reminded me of one of my friends houses that was decorated with bunnies because she was obsessed with them - except for this time it was eggs and chickens. That along with the mason jar glasses got me off on the wrong foot almost immediately.

The saving grace was once again the food. Somehow the places with the worst decor or annoying music or bad service always has good food. This place was no different albeit the staff was super friendly and the music wasn&#39;t noticeable.

I had the handler which had bacon ham eggs cheese on a pretzel rolls. It was just about as perfect as could be. We also tried the veggie skillet and the Mexican omelette. The over easy eggs were overdone but it wasn&#39;t for me so why am i complaining. The only other things that I could see that were keeping it from getting another star is that the portions weren&#39;t the usual huge - i need to take half of this home - portions im used to. 

Apart from being only a tad more expensive than the usual diner price for me and the portions - especially the potatoes - it was a good solid breakfast place with a huge menu that could accommodate anyone&#39;s cravings and breakfast/brunch/lunch needs."

That&#39;s why I love this place.  They don&#39;t serve watery bland cheap coffee.  They give you the good stuff.  The crack of coffee.

When I was there, they had caramel flavored coffeecrackliciousness  and even offered to add whipped cream to it.  Now, that&#39;s pretty sweet.  And they give you a carafe of it for more refills.  Now that&#39;s awesome and a half.  Oh, and some real cream to boot.

And when you leave, they have coffee to go on the way out, for that extra insane caffeine boost.  Just in case you didn&#39;t get enough.  That&#39;s what I&#39;m talking about.

Food is pretty consistent and has a nice variety.  I had the lemon bread french toast with two eggs and bacon for $8.00.  And man, it was GOOD.  Now the lemon bread was kind of sweet, but it was still damn good.  I left full and happy.

They give you enough food, but not too much.  And it has a hint of health to it (if you want it to).

And how cool that they give you a mint before you leave.  I mean-- no big deal, but still nice."

The food and service quality is not what you expect from this restaurant.  With a business in downtown Downers Grove, we have been a regular  lunch customer.  We normally order take out.  We have not been happy with the food we order, and will no longer waste our money.  Our most recent order was today, and it was terrible!!!   The salad was soggy with water in the bottom of the container.  We ordered a hot pasta chicken salad.  This salad did not even have the pasta.    When we called to advise them, they could care less. My husband and I frequent the Yorktown location, every Sunday morning, and I have recently reviewed that location.  What A difference!!  We will continue to go to the Yorktown location, and enjoy the wonderful food and service.  This location has just lost our business."

But I LOVE Egg Harbor Cafe. The food is delicious. It just seems fresher and more wholesome than standards breakfast places. Not so heavy and greasy. I loooove the Farmers Market Benedict. The staff is also very friendly and I personally like the decor (for a breakfast place) - very down home country kitchen. We usually go on weekend mornings between 10am - 12pm and the place is always packed so there is usually a little bit of a wait. But once you sit down the service is fast.

My husband had his usual, pancakes, with sausage links and eggs over easy and it looks like the portions have been restored back to their original sizes. I went out on a limb and had a Firecracker Omlette (with a few adjustments) and I thought it was very good. My favorite part was that they had Pumpkin Spice coffee as their flavored coffee of the day, and it was SO good. I kind of have a problem with indulging in Pumpking before September, but I couldn&#39;t pass it up when I heard that&#39;s what they were brewing. Overall, we had a really nice experience.

At first I said where? They had to build a new street just to frame this great restaurant.  Service is great the cater to families with small children to make them so welcome.  Which then makes is easy to service adults as we are children at heart!

But their food and I usually have pancakes and hard to change to lunch food although their soups and sandwiches are also excellent and very delicious.  But try the Pumpkin- or blueberries- or blackberries and banana pancakes you will have a taste of heaven!  And you won&#39;t ever order them at any other restaurant you will be totally spoiled. 

This franchise makes sure that which ever one you go to....will not disappoint you.  The only difference is the difference of size of seating and distance from home."

The occasion was general &amp; casual, for a small gathering of friends, for eats &amp; drinks. None of us 5 have ever been here or knew someone that has.  PT&#39;S was a convenient meeting place for all of us (it was centralized, with easy access from 355).  Our gathering was at 4:30 Monday.

I was the first to arrive, with the others shortly there after.  The place wasn&#39;t that busy (mostly people sitting at the bar &amp; about 5 tables occupied).  The atmosphere was what I expected, or a sports bar type of place....plenty of TV&#39;s for ones pick of games.  Our waitresses were Amelia &amp; Crystal.  Due to a shift change half way through, was the reason for two servers.  Both ladies were helpful and pleasant.  But then, less than 5% of their tables had seating.  Bar &amp; food service was average.  I explained they we were in no rush for food, due to our socializing. 

We ordered a variety of their wing specials, curds, &amp; chili.  All the dishes were average tasting, with nothing to rave about in comparison to other sports bars.  We later ordered our main dish which was a variety of different sandwiches for each.  I was the only one who requested their homemade chips.  I was disappointed with them.  Whatever their reason for serving was wrong.  They were homemade, potato slices, that were thick, cold, and way overcooked.  Our sandwiches were hot and what the menu described.  Were they exceptional, NO.  The food was what you&#39;d expect from a bar.  At least what we ordered.

I gave JT&#39;s 3 stars, due to their being an average eatery.  First impressions go far today, in the food business, (as with everything else today).  All of us found nothing exceptional about their food.  And believe me, there are the sport bar/restaurants we return to, over &amp; over, due to how great the food is.

I would suggest to the owners at JT&#39;s to replace some of the bar tables with regular tables &amp; chairs.  My logic is if I wanted to sit eating in a bar stool, I would seat at the bar.  I recommend the tables too, for ladies.  The closing question, would I return or recommend for eating??  Only if you want average bar food."

There was plenty of indoor &amp; outdoor seating when we arrived, of course we chose to sit outside to enjoy the weather (and beer!)
They had drink &amp; food specials on a Saturday, which is always nice!

The guy tells me that he is the owner and that I can leave. I told him that I was spending a significant amount of money in his place despite only drinking water, but I was glad to leave, if he was the owner. He was really kind of aggressive and I assume it was either beer or his affliction shirt making him act that way. Honestly, I would never go back to this place.

The service is good, our service Sarah was really friendly and helped me choose between 3 items on the menu I was stuck between.

Decent bourbon and scotch selection to top it off. 
There&#39;s nothing pretentious about JT&#39;s. They don&#39;t claim to be Glen Prairie so it&#39;d be unfair to hold them to the same standards. For what they are trying to achieve, a nice neighborhood sports bar, they achieve it and well. 
Bartenders and staff are friendly as well. I can&#39;t remember names well but the 2 girls are sweethearts! Also our first time there some locals let us try some delicious brownies his mom made for one of the girls birthdays. Like I said friendly staff and people.

You wanted to love someplace, but you walked out disappointed.  Well, now it&#39;s my turn.

I wanted to love JT&#39;s Porch, because a friend of mine raved about their wings.  Five of us met up here on a Monday night, for their 50 cent wings, and while it was busy it wasn&#39;t overcrowded or too loud.  I don&#39;t like traditional wings, so I ordered the boneless (not included in the 50 cent special).  They are definitely big, but I didn&#39;t particularly like either sauce I tried.  I tried the Buffalo and Spicy Garlic, and there wasn&#39;t much differentiation between the two.  Neither sauce was anything greater than ordinary.  The cheese curds were just okay.

The beer list is decent, there is a variety of draft beer and bottles to make everyone happy.  There&#39;s also a full bar for cocktails, and on Monday night there was some kind of $4 cocktail special.

We sat down immediately, but it took our waitress awhile to acknowledge us and take drink orders.  The service that night, overall, was bad.  She forgot our drinks, and our food took forever to arrive at the table.  When we got our food, everything (appetizers and all) came at once, and one of the orders was wrong.  At the end of the night, she gave us our checks and said, &#34;you might want to check those.  They could be wrong.  But they should be right.&#34;  Ugh.  Not my job, chick!  So I can&#39;t say I was surprised that our check was wrong, and we were billed twice for our wings.  

This might be one of those places that you just love if you&#39;re from the neighborhood.  It&#39;s probably not a place I&#39;d visit again though."

The place was packed! We got to the bar about 15-20 minutes before the trivia was supposed to start and every table was claimed. The bar is a little smaller and probably only had 10-15 high tops. Luckily my sister spotted a group that were finishing up their meal and wasn&#39;t going to stick around for the trivia. We swooped in and got a seat! 
The menu is simple and your standard offerings of bar food. Our waitress was really nice but obviously slammed, so taking our order took a long time, but again, it wasn&#39;t her fault, and we weren&#39;t in any rush. 
We decided to just share a feast of appetizers. We got boneless BBQ and hot jalapeno wings, cajun and chipotle ranch fries, mozz sticks, and pretzels with cheese. We were so healthy...
Wings - big meaty pieces with a good crunch. The BBQ wings were a little on the sweet side, but delicious. The hot jalapeno were not hot at all, which was disappointing, but had great flavor.  
Fries - The cajun fries were hotter than the wings. Great seasoning, not overly salty and you get a boat load of them. The chipotle ranch fries were milder and was full of flavor. They have about 6 different fry options all coated in a dry rub. Not sure if they are hand cut fries or frozen to fryer but they were pretty good. 
Mozz Sticks - Delicious. You get 10! Usually places will only give you 4-6 but there was an abudence of this gooey cheesy god like food. Cooked well and the marinara dipping sauce was full of flavor. 
Pretzels - meh. Tasted like they were the frozen to microwave. Very stale and in comparison to the portions of the other food, not that much. Cheese sauce was too thick and lacked any flavor. 
This place had $10 domestic buckets and we went through 4. 
All in all it was surprisingly cheap. 5 people, all that food, and 4 buckets... only $80 bucks. 
We really want to come back and check it out on a non-trivia night!"

I got the BBQ, hot and spicy garlic. They came out at a fairly reasonable time. Good size wings with a good amount if meat. Sauce was ok, nothing special. 

They had the sound on for the first game but not the second which is when the jukebox went on. Pretty much all metal and or heavy rock. I don&#39;t mind either but it got to me after a while.

Short description: Standard bar with some food choices.
Pluses:  Burger was okay.  It was quick at least.
Negatives: Limited beer selection. Service was a bit off for me, even though I was sitting at the bar.  Granted, I was just one person and the bartender was more interested in talking to the 4 drunk people.
Recommendations: Skip it.  Though I didn&#39;t try the wings, which is apparently a strong suit.

Edit: I&#39;ve been advised to give it 2, but i&#39;ll stick with 3 for hope that their wings make up the difference for someone out there."

Me and my boyfriend are wing enthusiast and are on a hunt for the best. We have probably been to 30 restaurants that claim to have great wings, and JT&#39;s is hands down the winner. 

Spicy garlic sauce is delicious. A little spicy, a hint of sweet, and a good amount of garlic. Wings are huge and meaty with just the right amount of breading. I can&#39;t speak for any of the other food (because I&#39;m always too full from eating only 5 wings)

My friend and I ended up getting the Not Your Father&#39;s Root Beer Brew (10% alc.) which is made in Wauconda at Small Town Brewery.  DEEEEE-lish!  Love the beer list...did I say that already?! =]

On to the food...we ordered cheese curds, fried mushrooms, wings (spicy garlic and buffalo) and burgers (saloon and one with guacamole).  Those burgers...wow!  So impressive!  You could tell that everything was fresh and it was cooked perfectly...and not to mention...JUICY!!  So so so good!  The curds and mushrooms were up there with some of the best I&#39;ve had, too.  The only thing that we felt needed a little work was the wings.  They were nice size and cooked properly, but the sauce was just too thick and sauce-y and there was way too much of it on the plate.  If it were thinned out a bit and they had a lighter hand in serving it, it would have been much better.  Next time I will just opt for the dry rubbed wings instead, problem solved! =]

For instance, their parmesan tilapia and fish tacos are delicious, and the tilapia comes with Roasted Potatoes &amp; Asparagus... what other sports bar has a menu like that?  Don&#39;t expect a quiet dining experience, all the tables are high tops... no booths..but who really wants that in a sports bar?

USED TO BE.  The new owners have changed the recipe for the burgers and they are garbage now.   My whole meal was borderline horrible.  The burger had no flavor, was smaller than they used to be, and was overcooked.  Same with my girlfriends burger.  Dry and overcooked.  The &#34;fresh cut fries&#34; were a nightmare of a different kind.  How they managed to make them stale is beyond me, but both of our fries were unsalted and tasted like they were cooked, then sat out for a while then put back in the fryer.  GARBAGE!  We also got the nacho&#39;s.  We added steak to those, the nachos were very underwhelming, but the steak was tasty and excellent.  I had a horrendous experience with the calamari the other day too, severely overcooked and unbelievably salty, like insanely salty.  I didn&#39;t write a review that day because a kitchen can have a bad  day.  I realize that.  But after today, and the change in the burgers.  THE PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW.

Typically more of a last-call bar for me, JT&#39;s is close to home (walking distance), and an over all friendly place....Sunday night through Thursday. Fridays and Saturdays, on the contrary are loaded up with D-bags and tools. 

It&#39;s like a complete 180 from the weeknight bliss with the chill tunes, the space to walk, and the quality service. Step foot in this place Friday or Saturday night and be prepared not to move, and to hopefully find a place out of the way enough to avoid the Jersey Shore wannabes. 

Other than that, here are the things I like about JT&#39;s. The wings-holy deliciousness, the wings. We&#39;ve been ordering these since I was a kid, because mom loved them too. The red wing sauce is soooo good. (I&#39;m pretty sure I figured out the secret recipe, so if you&#39;re interested...let me know, I&#39;ll hook you up). The food in general is pretty decent.

The building has housed numerous bars/restaurants over the past 30 years. The owner of  JT&#39;s re-opened one of the locations in the Halftime Sports Bars franchise.

So much for the history. Let&#39;s talk about the two favorite items that I go there for. The wings and the burgers. The wings are the best I have ever had. They are a different type of wings than your usual wing drenched in buffalo wing sauce. These wings are dry rubbed and they are the biggest wings around. 10 wings are more than enough for a meal.

The heat comes from the amount of cayenne pepper they put in the dry rub. The hottest wings are red in color there is so much cayenne.

The burgers are very large, juicy and flavorful. They are the same burgers they had at Halftime except for where they are cooked. Halftime would cook them on a grill right behind the bar. JT&#39;s cooks them in the kitchen. You can get either fries or home made chips. Both are very good.

The large u-shaped bar is in the middle of the place with tables on two sides. The clientele range from the young 20&#39;s to the 50&#39;s depending on the time of day. This place is definitely not a place for families to go to. There is a nice patio also. If you want to try any of their food but do not want to eat in, they do have carry out service.

They have a band each Saturday night.

We ordered the cheese curds - amazing!

I had a burger, and it&#39;s now my new favorite burger in the area!!! I&#39;ve a huge fan of burgers to begin with, but this is now my local fav. The meat is hand packed and portioned well at 8 oz, cooked perfectly, and came out perfect with awesome melted cheese on top, the bun itself was perfectly soft and delicious too!

My wife ordered the blackened chicken panini, and while it was OK, she said she probably wouldn&#39;t order it again. I tried it, and I thought it was ok, but was really expecting to taste a little bit more of the &#39;blackened&#39; part, as it didn&#39;t seem to have as much flavor as I expected.

I&#39;m not a big drinker, so I usually shy away from the bar/grill scene for several reasons. Drunk people get loud. Sports on multiple big TV&#39;s annoy me. Too much grease. Burgers that taste like cardboard. None of these things make for a pleasant dining experience for me. So I was kind of expecting bad food and a bad time. 

Was very pleasantly surprised to be disappointed here, if that makes sense.

Started with the cheese fries. I have not had cheese fries this good in ages. Green onions, bacon bits, ohhhh nom nom nom. I had a bacon cheeseburger that was too big for me to finish. Did you read that? TOO BIG FOR ME (ME!!) TO FINISH! My dining companion had the steak quesadilla and said that it was excellent. 

Server told us that even though the gift certificate stipulated that alcohol could not be included in the $35 minimum purchase, they allowed it to be. It was a rare moment that I WISHED I was more of a drinker.

A friend and I first went there the summer of 2008. We had a get together with about 20 people and the manager was very agreeable to accommodating the group. There was a Blue&#39;s Band that night and we had a great time -- with no cover. Since then she and I go back to JT&#39;s at least once a month. I&#39;ve taken a lot of family and friends there for lunch and dinner. The staff is friendly. The place is clean and everyone is really friendly. The food is very reasonably priced, nice portions, and very good. In the summer there is an outdoor patio area and although &#39;smokers&#39; sit outside it&#39;s still nice to hang and sip a beer out there. The name says it all - it&#39;s a porch, a saloon, and an eatery. Some weekend&#39;s it&#39;s a great place to see bands. Call to find out who is playing. NEGATIVES - only 2: first their website is not always updated with current band information, and the other is that there are a lot of TV&#39;s that are always on - even when bands play. I for one don&#39;t want to watch rodeo animals at all - let alone while I&#39;m eating food. (Eric, please --- no more rodeo rough riding crap.... please not that!)"

Sounded good enough so my girlfriend and I went there to grab a table. The front of the place is kinda scary, you can&#39;t see whats inside and the couple of people outside smoking just kinda stared at us as we walked in but once inside we got a table, the waitress was awesome (Amy) and she took care of us like we were the only people there, even though the house was full. I expected a rowdy crowd but it wasn&#39;t like that at all. Some guys and girls in work attire out for a burger, some softball teams that must of just got done playing, a handful of 20 somethings and some 30 somethings etc. The drinks are priced right, the place is casual, the bouncer wasn&#39;t full of himself, the owner was cool and actually came and talked to us here and there etc. We even decided on getting food, staying well past the fights, called some more friends to come join us and had a great night there. In the end (with ribs i might add!) we spent something like 45 bucks. Not bad at all. I&#39;d go back without worry about whats beyond the doors this time lol."

We love seeking out great pizza places.  As an East coast, 1st generation Italian, I get slightly picky even though it was a last minute decision to order a pizza for the kids.  Anyhow, my kids were ok with food.  However, if I&#39;m gonna suffer through the gluten pains later in the evening, I want the pie to be worth it.  Unfortunately not the case here.  My biggest peeves?
1. Seemingly unseasoned dough (read:no salt)
2. Chewy thin crust.  That&#39;s not crusty to me.
3. Bland toppings.  Again, unseasoned tomato sauce.

The only time I&#39;ve ever received a mediocre pizza from Rocco&#39;s was a couple times on a Friday or Saturday night when they&#39;re super-busy and cranking them out as fast as possible.  Even their mediocre pizzas are better than some other places normal pizzas.

We hit this place up for lunch on occasion and we were never disappointed with our food! Recently, I took the boy here for breakfast since it had been a while.

My default breakfast item is the Veggie Hash with two poached eggs, sweet potatoes, carrots, peppers, white potatoes, brussel sprouts, onion, peas, and corn. I really love this take on hash! It&#39;s just the right size to get you going to the day! It&#39;s not a big greasy mess, it&#39;s got a nice variation of healthy elements, and it&#39;s well done overall!

For lunch I love to get the BLT Club with a cup of their soup of the day as my side instead of chips. I have yet to try one of their soups that I didn&#39;t like! Especially on a cold, rainy day! This may seem like a pretty basic dish, but it&#39;s a great go-to!

I had eggs, bacon, hashbrows. Good all around except bacon was flimsy (i asked for &#34;extra crispy&#34; almost like the bacon is made earlier in the day and sits in a bin ..meh could have done without that hence the 4 not 5 star.. if im gonna do pork it better be spot on... just sayin.

My buddy took myself and four others to Butterfield&#39;s Pancake House to help us start our recovery.  When we got there a little after 10:00 we were told it would be a 25 minute wait which was highly disappointing.  We begrudgingly sat down and literally less than 2 minutes later they were calling my name.  Apparently they had a table that they totally forgot about and were able to seat us immediately.  This may have been the best thing that happened to us all day.

The breakfast menu was one of the biggest I&#39;ve ever seen.  It had literally every breakfast item I could imagine and it was all reasonably priced.  I ordered the South of the Border Frittata which seemed to pack the most bang for my buck with 4 eggs and a side of pancakes or cornbread at $9.99.  The frittata was good, and fed me all day; but the cornbread was awesome.  I honestly don&#39;t even know if it was homemade or not, and maybe it was a result of the activities from the night before, but for some reason that cornbread just tasted amazing.

The second time I&#39;m here, I got the corn beef hash skillet. Corn beef without onion and green pepper. No Monterey cheer and light on jack cheese with 2 eggs over easy.  Omg, break the egg yolk and let it soak all over the hash brown.... Hummmm I&#39;m craving for another one as I type. So fatty so delicious.

On the side, it comes with 2 pancakes, the cakes were a little over cooked, but it&#39;s extremely buttery. Pour maple syrup all over and slab some strawberry + grape jams for a perfect taste and bite!

Oddly enough, I ordered the same thing both times - the California Chicken Wrap. The first time I got chips as a side and I guess this last visit in I was feeling a little crazy because I switched things up with a little chicken noodle soup action as my side.

Both the wrap and soup were good. Nothing spectacular, but okay. The wrap is listed as a &#34;local favorite&#34; and is made up of a soft whole-wheat tortilla filled with grilled chicken breast, chopped romaine lettuce, tomato, avocado, and Monterey Jack cheese. Ranch dressing was served on the side. The ingredients were fresh and the wrap was satisfying, just nothing special. It was super messy to eat and it kept falling a part. Maybe it wasn&#39;t wrapped properly? Or maybe overstuffed? Who knows. I also wish that the ranch was just included in the wrap mixture, because dipping it on the side was quite difficult.

The chicken noodle soup follows suit in that it was good, but nothing special. Could have been your regular old canned soup for all I know. We were set up with a pitcher of lemon water at the table, which is always ideal. I asked if they had iced green tea, but that was a no-go. 

Our waitress was very nice and efficient. The menu is pretty big and includes breakfast and lunch items. I think next time I&#39;m there I&#39;ll have to give breakfast a go!"

Needless to say, a friend insisted on treating us to lunch and so we obliged. We had four kids and two adults.

I really, really wanted an omelet for lunch, and I was happy to see that it wasn&#39;t too busy so I knew I&#39;d be able to go back to work in a reasonable amount of time.  Some of my co-workers have thought about going here, but they surely won&#39;t get a recommendation from me.

I was seated quickly, and the waitress came to take my order.  I only wanted water to drink, but needed a minute to check out the menu.

I quickly decided that I wanted the Bacon, Date, &amp; Goat Cheese omelet.  How phenomenal does that sound?  I looked up, looked around, and I didn&#39;t see her anywhere.

I saw her walk past my table twice.  She stopped to deliver the check to the table behind me, set up a high chair at another table, walked into the kitchen area and stared into space.  We even made eye contact, and even though it seemed like she was avoiding me, I thought she was going to come to my table.

15 minutes later, I got up and walked out.  I was hungry and had limited time.

I don&#39;t know why. Convenience?  I would have left off reviewing and leaving negative feedback but I just can&#39;t let it go. There&#39;s always something subpar with my order. I&#39;ve completely given up getting the hashbrowns as they are always way undercooked and raw. With a smattering of browning...on the outside. Inside potatoes...raw and uncooked. The one time I asked for them to be cooked more thoroughly, they just came almost burnt to a crisp outside but still raw and uncooked in the middle. That&#39;s it. No more hashbrowns even though I love them. Not from here. Anyhow, pancakes have usually been pretty dry. Today those were the saving grace. Fluffy and warm and yummy. But the eggs. Shudder. Gross and watery or greasy. Maybe from the cheese added but it didn&#39;t seem like cheese residue. And scrambled eggs shouldn&#39;t have slimy residue all around the edges. Just yucky.   The final straw for me that will have me not coming back anymore to give further chances for disappointment was the fruit. How can you mess up fruit, you ask?  Well, have all the strawberries and grapes be so soft that they are almost mushy. **hands clapping and brushing off crumbs** I&#39;m done. Oh, and all this at ridiculously high prices. No."

They got me hooked on eggs benedict and I have yet to have a decent benedict anywhere else in the area.

I&#39;m only giving it 2 stars because my husband enjoyed his dish and the pancakes were ok. I had the bacon and onion skillet. The hash brown and onion were very undercooked. Also there were a bunch of miscellaneous ingredients in my dish. I kept finding pieces of mushroom, tomato, and peppers. My son ordered an apple juice which I assumed would come in a kids cup. Instead the waitress brought a $4 large glass. Seriously. $4 for apple juice! Blah. I really hope we don&#39;t make our way back here again."

Ok, friends were great, but the restaurant itself was average.

We showed up and waited for our friends for about half an hour. The waitress seemed displeased with this. Sure, we weren&#39;t delighted either, but it wasn&#39;t our fault. I politely ordered coffee and she kept the refills coming. 

The food came out pretty quickly after we ordered. I ordered the hazelnut, nutella and banana french toast. The french toast by itself was nearly $9.25. For 2 full slices of bread with half a banana and a sprinkling of nutella, that is crazy. I could see it being close to $10 if it included hash browns or sausage or eggs or something. But for the french toast alone, ridiculous. Frankly, the cheapest thing on the menu was eggs. 2 eggs by itself was $5.25. Um..wtf. The markup is crazy. Everyone else at the table ordered something similar to mine (aka some variation of french toast) and it was all the same price. My coffee was $2.95 which I still think was a little high seeing as each cup was about enough for 3 gulps. 

It was nearing 3 pm when we left (and incidentally, when they close). Our waitress brought us the bill and told us &#34;we&#39;re closed. If you want to keep talking, you&#39;ll have to leave&#34;. Um. Ok. There&#39;s nicer ways to boot people out. There were several other families still sitting in the restaurant, but we were asked to leave. 

It&#39;s not like we were causing a ruckus, just 2 polite quiet couples out for a brunch, albeit a late brunch. With so many other great restaurants in the area, I don&#39;t think we will be back."

Crepes are fantastic and so is the strawberry mascarpone French toast. But I can never just order one entr√©e. I order crepes or the French toast plus either eggs Benedict or a skillet of some type. 

I love Dunkin&#39; Donuts coffee, but the coffee here is a competitor to Dunkin. 

Service has always been very good. Even when the place gets super busy. But the best thing I like about Butterfields is that my food is out and on the table no more than 10 minutes after I order. Regardless of the restaurant is packed with a 30-40 minute wait, or you walk in and sit down.

So we finally got lucky got the menu than there wS this young server number 7 she came took our order with not too much of a delay we were served the food I couldnot imagine how bland everything was Mexican burrito was made for toddlers. And panini had more artichoke than chicken so it was way to sour for my taste. Bill was almost served few mins after they put food on our table We end up consuming some food nobody came around and i was in need of some box so I could pack the leftovers l I.

It&#39;s honestly nothing special. At least nothing beyond nostalgia. It certainly has that going for it. The pancakes are not from scratch. Nothing I&#39;ve had has really stood out. Well, nothing besides the fresh orange juice.  --that stuff I could drink all day!

Stay far away from the New Mexico Skillet. --it is one greasy mess of a skillet. The cornbread they feel they are famous for is over mixed, causing it to be too dense. --Mix only until incorporated! The other skillets are okay. Nothing has been bad (um, except for the New Mexico); it&#39;s just nothing I get excited about either. 

I go because my kids beg for it on Saturday mornings and I don&#39;t have the heart to say &#34;no&#34;.  Sleeping in on Saturdays during the winter and then schlepping out to breakfast is a family tradition. With the proximity and the fact that I can avoid downtown parking, I&#39;ll still continue to go. They win by default.

I think the price is a little on the high side, but I think the food is off decent to high quality for being a standard pancake house. We&#39;ve been to other places in the area with cheaper prices where you can notice a drop off.

Biggest negatives I have are that the service can sometimes be hit or miss (attentiveness - in my opinion I shouldn&#39;t have to wait long at all for refills on a coffee...like, my coffee cup should almost never be empty), and my biggest pet peeve is they have a back area that is secluded from the rest of the restaurant - this is where they&#39;ll seat you (9 times out of 10) if you have small children.  It&#39;s when you&#39;re back here that I&#39;ve noticed the service can be neglectful.  Also, the ambiance/lighting of that area is terrible when compared with the rest of the restaurant.

Pros:
Food Quality
Speed of Service

Cons:
Price
Sometimes Service (can be hit/miss)
Seating when you&#39;re with children"

Plus one thing is for certain I have always liked the coffee refill service at Butterfield&#39;s. They are always on top of their game never an empty cup. 

I noticed on their chalkboard their homemade cream of spinach soup was one of the options. When I dine alone I am usually placed in their 2 seater booth, which I don&#39;t mind its cozy and all the condiments are right in front of you. I went forward and ordered a cup of soup and their Ham &amp; Swiss Panini. The fries were crispy and of course I loaded them up with Cholula sauce. Sliced pickles on the side was different and enjoyable compared to most places that give you a spear. The coleslaw is why I removed 1-star. I am more of a creamy coleslaw fan myself however there was no flavor and a thick texture to it. No worries, this did not spoil my mood. Their cream of spinach soup was FANTASTIC!!! I would say the top 5 best I&#39;ve had in my life.

A two star is &#34;Meh, I&#39;ve experienced better&#34; If you screw up a skillet you&#39;re through. I had asked for a bacon and mushroom skillet instead of their bacon/onion option. When she served it up in record time, it looked full of onions, those are taters? I&#39;ve never seen half inch wide noodle shaped hash browns before. Some of them were 3 or 4&#34; long. I picked a couple out to test and they had the consistency of an uncooked potato, also not very warm. I did something I haven&#39;t done in a long time and sent it back. I should of tried a different item but asked to be sure to try and crisp up the taters. I brought half home as usual and will have to reheat upside down to crisp up the potatoes. (see pics) The second skillet was a little better but not too enjoyable.

It had been some time since I was here for breakfast, as I used to frequent often when I lived in the area. I still use the same mechanic for 14 years so I may stop in here or Schmaltz when I drop off my vehicle for service. I was in the mood for a skillet today and Schmaltz Jewish Deli is very limited on breakfast items. They probably would of served my needs better and it may be a while before I return here. The super nice waitress did inform me they&#39;ve been getting a lot of complaints, so they are switching back to old style hash browns.

The service was spot on, although I never really got a greeting from a host, (a waiter finally approached me) as I stood there a few minutes before someone asked if I wanted to be seated. A customer actually walked up and asked if I was meeting him here? Apparently people just walk in and stand there waiting for others to join them, so if you come in by yourself you best say something. You would think at 8:30 am there would be a host greeting guests. 

If memory serves I think that was what turned me off this place. Cashier didn&#39;t even ask how my meal was and other than the kind waitress, the owner/manager present didn&#39;t even make eye contact and certainly no apology."

Suffice to say that their portions are on the larger side. I got their farmers skillet which included a plethora of meats and vegetables. Although Ive ordered a lot of farmers skillets from other places, my skillet at Butterfields probably had the best proportion of meat to vegetable to cheese to hashbrown proportion Ive ever had, which meant that they did not skimp out on the protein. 

The friendly service and general atmosphere really give it an inviting feel that allows me to overlook its louder noise level. 

A tip: if you wanna sample the biscuits and gravy, i suggest ordering the biscuit as your side carb to your main dish (instead of rye bread, cornbread, or what not) and ordering just a side of gravy (its cheaper that way)!"

They&#39;ve got damn good coffee service- that&#39;s for sure. My mug was full the entire meal. They must have been refilling it somewhere in between my sipping and blinking because I KNOW I drank a sh*t ton of coffee today, but I only remember seeing our server top it off like twice. They be nimble and they be quick here... and now I&#39;m prepared to not sleep till March. 

B-field&#39;s is a super spacious breakfast, brunch, and lunch spot located about 7 minutes from downtown Naperville. I can appreciate this because downtown Naperville is gat damn cluster cuss during the morning (and afternoon and evening) hours so it&#39;s nice to get away from the parking and pedestrian madness of Washington Avenue and its tributaries. Also going for Butterfield&#39;s is it&#39;s adorbies factor. Cute animal statues and fun ceiling art made to look like giant waffles with butter melting. Very inviting, very clean and spacious yet cozy. They do fill up on the weekends, though. And there will be a wait, so just be prepared for that but they move the line quickly so it isn&#39;t a huge deal. 

The menu is pretty expansive- to the point where I think it&#39;s always taken me longer to decide what I want than it does for me to eat it. I like that they offer a variety of health conscious b-fast as well as the standard (and super tasty) artery cloggers. I&#39;ve been here when I was dying for some fatty food but went with their berry-granola-yogurt thinking I&#39;d be sacrificing flavor in order to be more fit but that wasn&#39;t the case at all. Turns out their berry-granola-yogurt combo is made of angel&#39;s wings with just a pinch of kitten dreams and not a sacrifice in the least. I&#39;ve also gotten their artichoke frittata and avocado bacon wrap (sans bacon) which sounded like pure heaven, but in actuality not nearly as good as I remembered the granola dish to be. Also, their guacamole (comes with the avocado bacon wrap) was surprisingly good.

For my next visit I&#39;m going to get the spinach and Gruyere crepes. 
For my next visit after that I&#39;m going to get the portobello benedict.
And for my visit after that one I&#39;m going to get the taffy apple french toast. 

I could probably go on and write out what I plan on getting for my next 7 meals here but I don&#39;t want to sway your opinion too much. Head over to Butterfield&#39;s and decide for yourself."

She&#39;s definitely a regular here since it&#39;s been her brunch spot literally every Sunday for the last few years.  Now I know why she keeps coming back.

As soon as I walked in, I saw their industrial sized juicer pouring out freshly squeezed OJ.  Good sign.  I was just sitting at the front waiting for Maryum when the host handed me a menu to look.  No words needed.  He read my mind.

We were seated in large comfy booth and attended to very quickly-no muss no fuss service.  Love that they had Louisiana hot sauce.  Sad they didn&#39;t carry Coke (RC only) nor alcohol...no blood mary=(  

I ordered the Corned Beef Hash Skillet ($9.29).  Amazeballs.  Buttery crispy hashbrowns topped with corned beef hash then eggs.  I could only finish half my skillet.  Portions here are overly generous.  I chose the cornbread for my side and it&#39;s definitely not to be missed. Actual flecks of corn and mild peppers in it for that added kick.

You know, like that favorite pair of shoes you keep until the sole is gone and the heel breaks off: it&#39;s not exciting, it&#39;s not unexpected, but it is comforting, and always there.

The menu doesn&#39;t have anything off the beaten path or unusual sounding, but it does offer a huge selection of delicious breakfast standards. I&#39;m partial to the cheese grits bowl - warm, delectable southern goodness topped with bits of bacon and two perfectly poached eggs. It&#39;s heavenly. I&#39;ve never ordered anything I&#39;ve hated, though, and Ive tried a lot. The coffee is always hot, the service is quick, the wait times are reasonable, and it&#39;s a great old standby to have in the neighborhood.

I also really appreciate that they do carryout, for those mornings where I can&#39;t bear to look presentable. And they do carryout well - all your breakfast accoutrements (jelly, butter, syrup, etc) come neatly packaged alongside your fresh, hot meal. 

If you&#39;re looking for wild decor and fancy menu options, this will not be your breakfast spot. But if reliable, delicious breakfast is what you&#39;re craving, pull up a chair and get to eating. Just save some of those cheese grits for the rest of us."

The server came over pretty promptly and asked for our drink order. Before we finished even telling her she was running off and I had to shout the rest to her as she walked away. She returned with the drinks and we were still looking over the menu. We are visiting and have never been to a butterfields so it took us a few minutes to decide. So we told her to give us two minutes. Well we finished our coffee and still hadn&#39;t order the two minutes was more like ten. We ordered and got our food in a decent amount of time but we once again were out of coffee, cream and sugar as well. We then waited a few minutes for her to come back with our toast that was missing and we didn&#39;t have any forks. We decided we couldn&#39;t wait any longer so I got up and took some from another table near by. I also went to the side stand to ask for cream and sugar. She eventually came and gave more coffee but never asked how our food was. My sister in law totally got the wrong order. We waited about 5 minutes to get our check and we went to the front and asked to have her meal removed and they did. To sum it up the food was not to bad but terrible service. I&#39;m a server myself so I usually give them some leeway but in this case we were just looked over and neglected. Table 61 server one=F"

Dining for breakfast seemed like a good idea.  It was a Saturday morning, around 10am and the parking lot was packed, but we were quickly shown to our seats by a pleasant a courteous staff.  The first great impression was the coffee, it&#39;s not Starbucks but it was hot, strong and well brewed.  We got real cream and a pitcher of water with lemon appeared on the table.  So far so good. The menu is very large and has all the usual breakfast items, boasting that they crack eggs to order.  My daughter had pecan pancakes (minus the bananas), I ordered eggs over easy, sausage links, rye toast and  the orange juice.   I had heard raves about the fresh squeezed orange juice, and it is on display when you come in the front door....an automatic contraption that holds the oranges, splits them, juices them and delivers the juice into a vessel at the bottom.  You gotta have it, right?  At $3.79 for a large glass, which I estimate to be 10 ounces, that&#39;s a tad pricey.  But I wanted it!  Service was prompt.  The &#34;pecan&#34; pancakes were standard pancakes with pecans strewn over them, no real effort there.  My eggs were a little runny on the whites, the hash browns were meh, and the sausage links (large country style) were too salty.  My rye toast was barely toasted, just warm and too soft to qualify as toast.  But the biggest surprise to my uber critical palate was the orange juice.  It&#39;s delicious, but largely because it is sweetened with sugar.  No fresh orange juice is that sweet.  Bet my paycheck they hit it with sugar or simple syrup.... you can taste it.  I didn&#39;t send anything back, I didn&#39;t complain because nothing was that bad, just not that great.  If I ordered eggs again I&#39;d probably try an omellette if they are not brown, skip the over salty sausage in lieu of either bacon or ham, ask for extra dark toast and pass on the potatoes and perhaps try one of the two types of grits (cheese/no cheese) that are on the menu.  There are  lots of other options on the menu that could be a lot better than what we chose. 

I am giving it three stars because nothing was obnoxious, and I might even go back again because the coffee is decent, service was attentive, and pleasant without being cloying and I now know what not to get and how to tailor my order., and there is a lot more on the menu. But there are families giving that oj to their children... might want to skip that and stick to milk, unless that is also sweetened.  I wish I could sweeten this review, but this is the best I can do.  I am coming down a bit hard because with tax and tip breakfast was about $33.00, and remember my daughter had pecan pancakes only...no other sides, no meat...so one expects the bar to be set high!"

The food was mediocre, at best.  My skillet was nothing special and my dining companion&#39;s meal had the wrong cheese which was really disappointing.  Also hollandaise sauce was disgusting.

Finally, the prices stink.  $3.29 for a tiny tomato juice?  Really?  Our whole bill was much more than other breakfast places and the quality was not good...at all.

I was so impressed with her efficiency and friendliness that I had to ask her name so I could give her a shout-out here. &#34;Jackie&#34; you were awesome! I loved just watching you do your job. We were so lucky that day to get you because you made what could have been an okay experience into an outstanding one. Your attentiveness to our needs was just perfect - not too much without ever forgetting about us. Watching you interact with other customers and staff did my heart good. Thanks for being you!

And, a shou-out to the cooks. Our breakfasts were made to perfection. I had the banana bread French toast and it was delicious. My husband&#39;s eggs and bacon were perfect. For someone who makes perfect eggs himself, he was quite impressed. Everything came out so quickly, was hot, and was fresh.

The only thing that would keep me from coming back here besides the distance to my home, would be the noise level. For some, maybe that is what makes this place fun, but for me, the noise of the kitchen combined with the noise of the chatter in the dining room, was not pleasant.

Now that we live in St Charles, this was the first time back in the area and decided to stop in for breakfast. There was the typical crowd out front, but it was only a 10min wait.

We both ordered a couple of poached eggs to share and side of biscuit and gray. The eggs were done to perfection (and are not $5.35 as noted by another poster- that&#39;s if you want toast and hash browns... these were $1.35 each egg. The gravy was OK- tasteful- but one of the biscuits was hard. 

In reminiscing on our favorites- I ordered my personal fav was the Strawberry cheese stuffed french toast. Hers was the Mexican Burrito. My wife was pleased with hers... Me, not so much. It used to be the strawberry &#34;sauce&#34; was homemade from strawberries. And... there were lots of strawberries stuffed in them. 

The order I received had about 3 strawberries sliced on top of the french toast... and about a total of two slices of strawberries stuffed. It was sad, I actually opened up the french toast just to see where I could get french toast, cheese and strawberry! For almost $10- Butterfields can do better. I get great Berries from the store during the winter months. The last piece I hated was the use of strawberry &#34;gel&#34; - an artificially flavored gel for overlaying on cheap pies. 

Can&#39;t say how much I was disappointed that my old favorite had changed so much. Needless to say, we won&#39;t be back unless I&#39;m just looking for a really good poached egg."

My boyfriend and I were the first of our group to arrive, so we put our name in for a table. Our table was ready as the others in our group were pulling into the parking lot, but since they weren&#39;t in the restaurant (they were getting the kids ready to come in) the manager almost threw us out. He was completely rude and gave us a hard time about the others not being at the table (&#34;We&#39;ve heard &#39;In the parking lot&#39; a thousand times!&#34;). I have never received service like that before. 

The food was ok. I had the Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict, and asked for a side of fruit, and they gave me a pretty small amount of food, especially for what I was paying. The taste was ok - nothing special. I tried a bite of my boyfriend&#39;s pancakes and those tasted nice. Our waitress was nice and attentive, and the food came quickly.

As we were getting ready to leave - putting the kids&#39; coats on, etc. - the manager pounced on our table and made us pretty uncomfortable by bringing a big group to our table and rushing us away. 

I understand that a breakfast restaurant is busy on a Sunday, but that isn&#39;t an excuse for making your patrons angry and uncomfortable."

Thanks be to the good Lord for Yelp &amp; my dad&#39;s love of technology for finding Butterfield&#39;s! We pulled into a parking lot that was filled with cars, and I was a little worried that this was going to be a 3-hour breakfast excursion... however, we walked in, put our name on the list, and 5 minutes later we were seated in a cozy booth. 

Fresh-squeezed OJ &amp; a Diet Coke (well, the Diet Coke here is actually Diet RC, if that kinda thing bugs you... but I personally enjoy the RC, so whatevs) was ordered to start my morning right. I had the strawberry crepes with a side of cheese grits, and all was delicious. Were the cheese grits made with that fake neon orange cheese? You bet they were, and they were delicious. The parents also enjoyed their meals &amp; all was well with the world. Hangover eradicated, happy &amp; full, I could now go on about my day.

I leave off one star because the service is a little spotty... they are just so busy it seems that the waitresses are spread a little thin. When I went to pay I felt like I stood there for an eternity due to people placing to-go orders at the cashier (it would be nice if that was a separate register). Other than that though, I&#39;d happily return to score some more breakfast goodness. 

The up-side of waiting in line to pay for a while was that I got to watch the OJ machine do it&#39;s work, and it was so cute how they let the little kids go up and put the oranges in... I would have rocked that out if I was a 5 year old! (Who am I kidding... I&#39;d rock that out now, too!)"

My issue has always been the service at this place, it is just so slow. I don&#39;t live far from this Jimmy John&#39;s, probably about half a mile. On ultimate lazy days when the weather is cruddy and getting out of bed seems like the worst possible life decision, I used to order delivery from here.

Typically my roommate and I would each order one sub. It would seem simple enough. However, they always take FOREVER! For two subs and only being a half mile from the establishment, they always take at least an hour for delivery.

Gosh, I feel so special, like I won something.... but i didn&#39;t.

Anywho.... Since I&#39;ve decided to cut back - I&#39;m eating a lot of veggies, and I decided to get the Vegitarian sandwitch this time.  Man was it ever good! For some reason I fell in amore with the bread this time!  It&#39;s like they went to heaven and stole the all mighty&#39;s loaf of bread, and gave it to me!

Who serves tacos without sauce?  

My friend ordered a beer and they brought the wrong one twice. 

Please note:  if you order the 6 taco plate, there&#39;s a charge of $5.00 for sharing your dish. So If you&#39;re full and want to give some to your friends or family, they will charge you $5.00.

He is very friendly and gives good recommendations.  The food is average, although I wish I could report better.  The margaritas were actually solid and not watered down.  They also have a decent wine list.  

The salsa they bring is okay.  The green was bland to me but the red was good.  The habenero that is available upon request is the standout.  I&#39;ve gotten the sampler, which allows you to try a bunch of different things.  The sopas were my least favorite, despite the fact that I usually love them.  These were just very bland.  The taquitos, which I usually find boring, were actually better than average.  Flautas were okay and the empanades were actually solid.  We also tried the tacos, which were again good but nothing special.  I will say I really enjoyed their tamales.  That was probably the best thing I&#39;ve had.  The seafood enchilades were good but again, not a standout.  For me, I really need a very good salsa for a Mexican restaurant so I hope that this can be improved upon and I can upgrade!

We were a bit disappointed. We arrived on a Thursday night to find the place mostly empty. We sat outside. We ordered some drinks, they were ok not anything special. The chips and salsa were decent. We had queso fundido for an appetizer. It was pretty good, but the cheese was thicker than I&#39;m used to. We split the taco platter - six different types of tacos. A few of the tacos were covered in onions, more onions than meat. The fish taco was probably the best one. 

The outside area is nice but it&#39;s missing something. Some music would give a more festive feel. Clarendon Hills &#34;downtown&#34; doesn&#39;t really have much life to it.

So it&#39;s Mother&#39;s Day and we had reservations for when they opened. It was our first time here and there was only five or six other tables sat. Drinks took a long time to get, ordering food took a long time, and getting extra anything (napkins, condiments, tortillas, etc) took a long time. Nobody made us aware of the day&#39;s specials either. I found out they existed after we ate. The food came quickly and tasted awesome! I would say today&#39;s crew was made up of inefficient servers/bar staff and/or they were short staffed
Again, the food was fantastic. 
So it came time to pay. I was short changed on purpose. My &#34;change&#34; was rounded down. Well my receipt said I was still owed a measly 46 cents. It&#39;s about the principal. The server acknowledged doing it and said she didn&#39;t have 46 cents. so it was rounded down. (So are they just taking everyone&#39;s change each shift? That&#39;s called stealing.) Two additional staff members scoffed at me and fetched 45 cents from the bar resister and made a snide remark while giving me the change. I tipped well at the table before speaking with them at the front desk on the way out and now I wish I hadn&#39;t after this treatment over the stupid 46 cents that was suppose to be mine after paying in the first place. Geez...
I&#39;ve been a bus boy, a host/cashier, a server, and a bartender and never did this to anyone. I was so taken aback that I created a Yelp account to add my 2 cents... the food was really great though."

Even after reading all the Yelp reviews about the horrible service, I really wanted to have an amazing experience with the staff and yet, it fell short - hence the 3 star review. We were 1 of only 3 parties of people in the entire place on a Thursday night and yet they screwed up our drink order, screwed up our food order, couldn&#39;t recommend a tequila (it&#39;s a Mexican restaurant, train your servers!!) and never once filled up our water glasses. 

As for the food it was beyond delicious. The homemade guacamole and salsas were to die for and we could have made a meal out of just those two things alone. My pork shoulder was seasoned so well it didn&#39;t even need the delicious sauce that came with it and while I&#39;m not a fan of beans, I couldn&#39;t stop eating the ones that accompanied my dish.

Our tequila cocktails were unique and tasty and the service was solid, especially being NYE when you may run into some angry servers. A few negative aspects included: Some high prices on menu items, not all, but the guacamole and carne asada entree seemed very overpriced, the desserts were just ok, and the service wasn&#39;t as good as it could have been. Overall, I strongly feel that many of the negative reviews stemmed from diners looking for a TexMex flavor and running into truly authentic favors and being disappointed.

We were taken aback by that because we looked around the restaurant and there were a ton of empty tables.  We told her we did not, and then she walked away to talk to what I think was the manager.  She came back a few seconds later and we were seated.

The food and drink menu were both a good size with a lot of different selections.  Free chips and salsa were placed at our table, and I was extremely disappointed with the salsa.  No one in my group ended up touching it.  I don&#39;t know how to describe the taste except it was just, off.  However, the fresh guacamole was delicious!  We wanted to order another one!  For my meal I ended up with the steak tacos and Mexican rice.  They were fine, nothing that special.  For my drink I had the white sangria and it went down super quick so I of course had to order another one.

Our waitress was pretty slow and we had to ask her a couple times for refills and more chips.  When our food came, 3 out of the 5 of us didn&#39;t have the correct order and she seemed kind of annoyed when we told her this, but did accommodate us, just not with a great attitude.

This is the first time I&#39;ve been in &#34;downtown&#34; Clarendon Hills and the area was pretty cute and the restaurant did have a nice decor (super cute glasses).  I probably wouldn&#39;t come back just because I believe I can find a better Mexican restaurant in the area."

It was busy  and you could barley hear the music.  Started with the chips and guacamole which was good.  We then shared the chicken enchiladas and the garlic shrimp.  Both were ok. Next time I would probably keep it simple and get the tacos.

The drink special was not special accept for the 11.50 price. If you have taste buds you wont end up here again. I was told if I want authentic to go downtown; this place is purposely not spicy for the area. I believe any 5 star rating are fake or people that are family or friends of the staff or owner."

The restaurant was decently busy but the place was not packed. The service was so slow. Our sodas took way too long to arrive. We asked for a refill of water and the waiter never brought it. It took almost an hour for our food to arrive and by that point, all of the tables around us had left. 

I had the tacos, which everyone else seems to like so much. The meat was fatty and they were very bland. 

The owner or manager asked us about our visit and when we commented that it was fine just really slow, he got really defensive. Maybe it was a rough night because I heard him apologizing to other tables about various things. Whether or not that is the case, I don&#39;t see myself wanting to go back."

Downtown Clarendon Hills sure is catching on! Aguamiel is a super cute place and I&#39;ve had a great experience both times I&#39;ve dined here. 
Pros- 
The 1800 Margarita pitcher is delicious and huge! Definitely enough for four to share! 
The hostesses are very friendly and helpful
Chips are fresh and salsa is interesting and delicious, just wish they gave you more!
The plantains they serve with some of the dishes are fantastic

Cons-
Our waiter seemed to be rushing us along during our last meal here. Never a good feeling. 
Don&#39;t order the specialty coffee, disappointing. Basically just coffee with a clove in it.
The Mole Chicken Enchiladas were a bit dry
No free dessert for a birthday, even though the waiter pushed a dessert choice on us"

One time when we were there the waiter cleared a pitcher of margaritas that was 1/3 full. On another occasion I called for a reservation and was told over the phone I was all set for the evening. Well, we got there and the reservation was lost. No apology from anyone. They said at least an hour to an hour and a half. We drove to Frontera and had amazing food and service. We have never been back to this restaurant and it is a shame because we enjoyed the food. An apology or at least acting like you give a care about customers goes a long way."

We were a party of 4.  We ordered a bottle of $35 wine.  The server came back and said that they were out of our chosen bottle, recommended another wine and said he would &#39;make a deal&#39; with us.  When the check came, the $35 wine turned into a $75 wine.  We politely protested and he brought out the owner, which is where the problem escalated.

The owner was condescending and rude. She agreed to reduce the cost from $75 to $52, stating that $52 was her cost. (I do not know of a restaurant that only marks wine up by 50%...)  When we explained that $52 was still unreasonable, and that we expected to be charged $35 for whatever the server recommended, she threw the server under the bus and tried to guilt us into paying more by saying &#34;do you think it&#39;s fair for the server to have to pay the difference&#34;.  We suggested that that was between her and her server and had nothing to do with the fact that we were dissatisfied.

This episode occurred in the middle of the restaurant at about 8pm on a Friday night. It was very uncomfortable.  We have never been in a situation where a restaurant owner did not make things right.  Our total check was about $140, so there was ample room for the owner to make an adjustment.

In the end, we had no choice but to pay the additional $17.  Unfortunately, the server ended up on the short end of the stick because his tip was reduced to account for the overcharged wine.  I routinely treat servers well (having one in the family) and tip a minimum of 20%.

The owner was very short sighted.  She just lost 4 first time customers for life.  This is unfortunate because we were very happy with the restaurant until this incident occurred."

Apps:
jalapeno rellenos - spicy, tangy and delicious
Tamales - decent but forgettable.
Guacamole - standard

Entree:
Taco, pick 3 - I chose baja fish taco (which was excellent), carne asada (which on the menu was listed as just having grilled onion but ended up with some sort of sweet sauce - meh) and braised pork belly (which tasted nothing like pork belly)

Margarita - the Cadillac is much more on par with a standard margarita. The House margarita tastes like fruit punch that should be served at a 12 year old&#39;s first pool party.

Bottom line, there is some room for improvement BUT I still give it 4 stars because it is a solid option when out in the western suburbs."

The first time I was here with a friend, I thought the food was fantastic, but that the service could be better. A lot better. I thought that since they had just opened, I would wait a while and see if there was improvement.

The second time I visited, I was meeting a friend at the bar. The bar crowd was much older and I suppose I forgot the unspoken rule of &#34;if you&#39;re female and order yourself a drink at the bar you are allowing men to hit on you even if they&#39;re older than your father&#34;. So, that was a life lesson, I guess.

I only ordered a margarita, and it was great. However, after I ordered that first drink, I was largely ignored. Even when I flagged down the bartender for another drink and then a glass of water, I got neither. 

When my friend arrived, we finally were able to order a couple more, but were largely ignored and couldn&#39;t receive service for all of our trying.

The last time I came here was with my dad and everything was again, delicious. However it was, again, difficult to receive service.

I think the food here is too good to have a place with such poor service. I would say go for the food and give it three stars, but honestly, good luck convincing anyone in there to actually serve you any."

High expectations were exceeded by the top notch restaurant Aguamiel, named after the honeywater of the agave plant (that becomes tequila and mezcal) which can be fermented into pulque.  The place is situated in the center of town among gift shops and an ice cream parlor and abundant parking.  Inside the restaurant was toasty in winter and cozy with a fireplace, hand blown glasses on the tables matched by hanging lampshades at the bar, and intriguing art including humanscale sculpture, paintings and the restaurant&#39;s insignia in metal above the fireplace.  Chef Kike&#39;s signature sauces shine at Aguamiel.  From the table salsas served with tortilla chips to the spicy brightly acidic tomato guajillo sauce cutting the rich slow cooked shortribs, the flavors were big and bold.  

The best may have been the smoky serrano chile sauce accompanying the grilled shrimp entree- deeply flavorful, complex, a hot herbacious campfire.  Ceviche was a mouthwateringly acidic starter with albacore tuna cooked in the acid of lime, the heat of chiles accented by the salt of diced olives.  Sopes featured rich shredded beef in buttery corn masa complimented by roasted tomatoes and onions.  The food was so delicious.  To drink we split a half pitcher of 1800 margarita- blanco tequila, fresh squeezed lime, limey and bright with a touch of sweetness from agave nectar, and a half pitcher of the cadillac margarita- smoother and rounder from tequila aged in oak, orange liquor lingering on the palette.  Both were excellent, as was the prompt service.  Chef Kike who worked for so many years at Frontera Grill has a place whose standards of Mexican cuisine and service deserve to be around for many years to come.  Well done and thank you, Chef."

To begin with, the warm, flaky, thin tortilla chips and dual salsas they bring are delicious. For starters, I&#39;ve had the taquitos, the guacamole, and the tortilla soup which is wonderful. 

The tacos are phenomenal. You can get three of each kind or do a &#34;you pick 3&#34; with any of them. I&#39;ve had the steak, carnitas (pork), chicken, and battered shrimp, all of which are delicious. The steak and pork both have a lot of onions on them though, so if you are not a fan of onions make sure you ask for them without. 

I always leave Aguamiel feeling overly stuffed but happy because I loved everything i ate. I highly recommend this restaurant."

This being said, Aguamiel has become a regular stop, not only for us but several of our friends as well. The food is always fantastic, service is always good so I would still give it a 4-5 stars BUT, my issue is with the bar, particularly the margaritas. Come on guys, give the customer what they order and what they pay for. Substitute the crappy bar mix instead of the &#34;fresh lemon and lime mix&#34;?  Completely fill the glass or worse yet, the pitcher with ice and skimp on the drink itself?  Now, I may not be a professional bartender but for sure, I can hold my own when it comes to margaritas and the one key ingredient in a margarita is tequila. What happened to the tequila? Especially the premium ones you are supposed to get when you order them.  On a recent visit, we had a group of 6 and ordered 3 pitchers of cadillac margaritas (yea, I know) and not one person had even the slightest buzz by the end of the night. (we could sink the Titanic with all the ice though)!  $100 in drinks?   C&#39;mon Aguamiel, you have too good a thing going to skimp on the drinks like this.  
I will return for the food and order a couple of margaritas in the near future, and will gladly revise my review if corrected."

The two salsas (served with tortilla chips) were a little less spicy than I usually like, but the flavors were interesting enough to make them delicious.  The guacamole of the day had habanero in it, and at first I thought there was a mistake as it was undetectable.  As we ate, I began to notice a subtle burn, and by the end of the little bowl, my lips were lightly burning and tingling from the heat, so I think it was perfectly seasoned for a serving for two people.

I had the vegetarian chile, and the flavor was superb.  Nicely spicy and smoky, with plenty of good vegetables and cheese in the ample-sized &#34;open face&#34; chile.  My husband loved his quesadilla special that included shrimp. 

The drink specials looked good as well; we settled on the gold margaritas that were amply-sized.

We will definitely be back!"

Our first few visits were outstanding! As for the last 10 or so it&#39;s been on the steep incline. 

My past visits we always enjoyed the margaritas, now I am pregnant and can only drink iced tea or some sort of boring beverage. I am very thirsty being pregnant so I had 4 of them, mind you they fill the small glasses ALL the way to the top with ice so it&#39;s literally like 5 sips, I was charged $3.00 EACH! I was baffeled, how can you charge for iced tea? it&#39;s water and tea bags?  $12! UGH! Seriously Aguamiel? I would have much rather had a margarita at that price (if I could), Also the waiter brought me a lemonade instead of a iced tea and still had the nerve to charge me for it. 

The waiter was also annoyed that I had him ask if their cheese was pasteurized. He was annoyed by this, this isn&#39;t the first time I had this waiter and he is very rude and was caring more about the large party that was also his table so we had to wait, I literally had to wait to get another iced tea for 20 minutes, then another 15 minutes for the sour cream I asked for 3 times.

Also I asked to wrap my leftovers and give me more flour tortillas as he gave my husband corn on accident, then on the bill we were also charged for those tortillas we didn&#39;t even want, not to mention sour cream 

It&#39;s not like you give us credit for the items we don&#39;t want on our bill so don&#39;t nickel and dime us for everything dinner shouldn&#39;t cost $85 without alcohol for 2 people. 

Disappointed, I don&#39;t know if we will be back. The customer service needs to be stepped up if you want repeating customers, you&#39;d actually have more customers if you properly take care of them.

Also take it easy on the mole sauce there&#39;s no reason to smother the food with it."

The menu is very original....but the food was just good....not great.

After we had been out on the patio for about 20 minutes by ourselves, other parties were seated out with us as well, but the service did not improve.

The staff was very attentive, but not in-your-face. 
The chips and salsa are always my favorite part of eating at a Mexican restaurany- but the salsa here was AMAZING!  I was enjoying the red salsa so much, but when I tried the green salsa I fell in love.
The sangrias were pretty darn good, too.  That was the ONLY thing I was looking for that night, and Aguamiel delivered.
Hubby ordered the pork belly with a mole sauce and mashed sweet potatoes.  on the waiter&#39;s recommendation.  He&#39;d never had pork belly before, but is adventurous so he gave it a try...and liked them alot.
I had the wood- grilled salmon in a peanut mole sauce with garlic spinach and mashed potatoes.
The potatoes didn&#39;t have a ton of taste, but the salmon was very good and the sauce was unique.  They blend alot of different  flavors to create unique dishes...which I find so fun!

This place is LOUD!!  Between the poor acoustics, and the numerous people who had one too many, you had to yell for the person next to you to hear, it was also difficult for the waiter to hear our order.

The food is much more authentic than most of the other Mexican restaurants around here, with unique items.  They have a number of different moles that are very good.

The staff could use some work, the front of the house was weak, and the waiter didn&#39;t get our order exactly right, perhaps he didn&#39;t hear us right with all the noise.  Also they were not quick to correct the wrong order, by the time they did we were already on our way out.

Service was minimal, waiter didn&#39;t come around much.

He suggested the rib special which my husband had and loved! Just the right amount of kick without lighting your mouth on fire! 
I loved the carne asada. It had a few spots that were a bit fattier than I like but most steaks do.  The highlight of my dish was the plantains! They were sauteed in maybe honey? Brown sugar? They had a perfect crisp glaze and then a drizzle of their fresh crema and a sprinkling of queso fresco? Goat cheese? Whatever it was, they were divine!
The music is a bit too loud, and I am not THAT old... the ladies bathroom music was actually loud enough you could not have dished with your friend about her date!
We will be back! And bringing out friends!"

Very fresh and flavorful. Certainly a welcome addition to the area. The prices are really good considering the neighborhood. Then there are the margaritas! By far one of the best I&#39;ve had outside of Mexico. Splurge and get the Cadillac, you won&#39;t be disappointed, great fresh flavor and no sickeningly sweet triple sec. Also take the server recommendations, they were spot on. The fish tacos are amazing for so few ingredients and the carnitas are melt in your mouth. My friend had the stuffed peppers and loved the combination of fillings. The tortillas are handmade, soft and delicious. 

The service is working out the kinks of being new, but no issues that can&#39;t be overcome with time. The servers I have had have all been very informative on the menu. My biggest pet peeve in restaurants is patrons asking the busboy for things out of his scope of work. FYI a busboy can&#39;t order food for you or get you another drink, other than water. There are certainly places that have ultra experienced busboys that will go tell the server what is needed but this guy can just do the basics which is fine, he is still doing his job and doing it well. I had people next to us complaining that he was &#34;incompetent and didn&#39;t even speak English.&#34; Get a clue folks and stop being so ignorant. 

They are very kid friendly which I would normally not be thrilled about, but since having a two year old nephew that has been dining out since 3 months, I appreciate a place we can all go. Btw, he loved the guacamole. I guess he&#39;s not really your typical 2 year old. The management knows how to seat a dining room because everyone cringes when they see the kid in the high chair. They put us up front by the windows and sat other patrons in another section. Granted this was very early on a Sunday night so they had the luxury of an empty restaurant to begin with. They also have plastic cups with straws for water that are given to all kids. 

Try Aguamiel, I&#39;ll be shocked if you are disappointed."
aguamiel-clarendon-hills,Kate W.,gqimocAPnvr9V-YjYhfElg,"Philadelphia, PA",0,1,1,211,9,8bXsziMpXP4WZeNwXgkrYA,4.0,2013-04-07,"Truly about 3.5 stars, but I&#39;m giving rounding up for the star rating since halves are overly fussy.  Food was delicious, service could use a little improvement. 

We arrived at 8pm on a Friday and were told it would be a 30 minute wait for 3, but we waited only half of that before being seated.  The bar was packed so we had to awkwardly plaster ourselves against the half-wall that separates the bar from the busy pathway to the kitchen.  Be smarter than we were and make a reservation!

I liked the look of the dining area, but it&#39;s so LOUD.  Not a good place for a first date or catching up with an old friend. 

The service - our waiter was perfectly nice and got our orders right, so yay for that.  However, food runners tried to deliver other tables&#39; food and drinks to us three times throughout the night, and our own waiter couldn&#39;t remember who ordered what when our entrees came.  Little details, but that&#39;s the stuff that would set this place apart from the competition, if they could get the details right.

I had a regular margarita - fine, not awesome, I&#39;m sure if I had upgraded my tequila it would have been better.  

The food is where this place shines.  I started with the ensalada fresca - jicama, cucumbers, and pineapple, with a little kick of chile powder.  Not only does it look amazing (and had diners at other tables asking me what I ordered) but it tastes fantastic - refreshing and fun.  My mom started with a special appetizer - tamales - which were very good (though were a little heavy on the masa/light on the meat for us), and my dad had the sopa classica, which was outstanding. 

For entrees, I had the camarones ala diabla (shrimp in some spicy sauce, with rice and zucchini).  They weren&#39;t kidding around with the spice here - very good, but not for the faint of heart - or rather, stomach.  If you typically order things medium or mild, this would probably not be a good choice for you, but if you&#39;re like me and love some heat, have at it.

My mom had the quesadilla with chicken and said it was wonderful (and she knows her quesadillas - that&#39;s her standard order when we go Mexican), and my dad went with a taco trio - al pastor (too sweet for him, I tried it &amp; thought it was good), carne asada (great), and pollo (his favorite).

I&#39;m surprised at how affordable everything was - parents&#39; entrees were under $10, mine was almost $20 (darn shrimp), apps were all under $10.  Here&#39;s to hoping they keep their prices reasonable, get their waitstaff and food runners a little more focused, and continue to create excellent meals."

They had pineapple and pork empanadas as appetizers. They were wonderful. My wife loves enchiladas. Hers were great. I always order Carne Asada. It was the best I ever had. The food and service could not be better. 

A very tiny downside is the noise level, it&#39;s a little louder than ideal. Overall Aguamiel is amazing. We will definitely be back."

I ordered the chicken enchiladas and the chicken was over cooked and the beans and rice were the worst just terrible. The enchilada itself had a sauce that was very different and did not suit my taste. They brought out the chips and salsa and the red salsa was empty when he brought it to the table and lead me to think of different scenarios as to where it came from. I told the waiter and he did not understand my comment as to why the container was mostly empty when he put it on the table.

Fortunately, we made a reservation. Since we just ate at CiNe, we were looking forward to dining at the neighborhood&#39;s other new Mexican restaurant. Like CiNe, this is is not the normal suburban burrito and fajita experience. The menu looked appetizing as there were numerous selections that looked muy bueno. Most dishes were less than $15. Started off with chips and salsas, green and red.  Chips were overly salty and they masked the taste of the salsas. The red salsa could have been a bit spicier. For dinner, I had the chicken enchiladas with a dark mole sauce.  They were good, but were not hot enough. And the rice and refried sides were luke warm as well. My wife ordered the chicken tostada which she also enjoyed.  Children&#39;s menu available for $6. Service could have been better.  Maybe they just need more help. Besides one dish not being prepared as we requested, a second basket of chips never arrived and the waiter never asked whether we wanted dessert, just dropped off the check.  Plus, one dish was also never cleared from the table. Management was very friendly and checked on us a few times.  Beware, the dining room is inordinately loud. Or maybe I just need a hearing aid, which my wife would agree with!

Compared to CiNe, the portions at Aguamiel are more authentic, larger and at a lower cost.  Quality is similar.  The atmosphere at CiNe is more to my liking and is not as loud. Plus, CiNe&#39;s chips and salsa were superior--I love my chips!

My disclaimer:  I&#39;m a California native so I take my Mexican seriously. We are deprived here in the Western burbs so I have high hopes for Aquamiel. Will be back in a few months to see if the kinks have been worked out."

We tried making a reservation for 7pm but we&#39;re told they only had an 8. Ok fine. 8 it is. We arrived early to get a drink and wait until we were seated yet when we arrived the place was half empty and we were seated immediately. Ok weird. Our server was good. Very polite and attentive without being obnoxious. I ordered 3 tacos and ended up not caring for one of them. Everyone else at the table seemed to really enjoy their food and the guac/salsa we had as well. Overall I thought this place was pretty good and would give it 3.5 stars.

Very inventive food, there is nothing ordinary going on here. 
This place brings me back to the days when I found Fronterra Grill on Clark Street. 
Regional Mexican cuisine is embraced here just as regional Italian cuisine is in a good Italian restaurant. 
One feels they are taking a tour of Mexico according to what they order off the menu, again nothing seems ordinary."

My dad had a really great margarita that was like a combination of a pina colada and a marg. If i didn&#39;t consume a 47 ounce margarita somewhere else the night before, I would have drank 5 of these :) One of the most delicious flavored margaritas I&#39;ve ever had!

We started with guacamole which was outstanding. Good texture, nice flavor without being too spicy. You can tell it was super fresh. I loved how the chips were thick enough to hold up the guacamole! My dad ordered the tortilla soup and really enjoyed it.

We each had the 3 taco platter. I chose 1 al pastor, and 2 carne asada. The Al Pastor sounded really interesting, with adobo flavoring and topped with bacon and pineapple. The smokiness of the adobo was almost a little too much for me, but the bright pineapple flavor cut through and the bacon was a nice addition. I was super excited for my steak tacos, which were supposed to be marinated skirt steak with grilled onions. Imagine my disappointment when they arrived with chopped, raw onion, and loaded with some cilantro type of sauce. They were good, but I really don&#39;t like raw onions and a lot of cilantro, so they weren&#39;t as enjoyable as I was expecting. My sister had the same as me and was disappointed by the same aspects. I only ate one taco and two bites of another.

My dad decided to get dessert - a mexican bread pudding and some mexican coffee. You&#39;d think the coffee would come pretty quickly, yes? No. almost 10 minutes pass, and someone drops off our check - without the coffee or dessert on there. Why? I don&#39;t know. It took a few minutes to flag someone down to tell them what was going on, then he took the check away and said he&#39;d be back - we weren&#39;t really quite sure if we were still going to get the items my dad had ordered or not, but then the coffee arrived. I tried a sip and it was outstanding! So many bold, delicious flavors, I would honestly come back here just to have a cup of coffee. About 10 minutes later, the bread pudding shows up. Our server explains that he dropped the first one and the chef had to make another, which is why it took so long. Well, the bread pudding was delicious too, and was served with what I think might have been pistachio ice cream. Creamy, crispy, and warm, this was a lovely dessert.

It took a while to get an updated check, then to have someone come get the credit card, then to have them come back with it. I don&#39;t think that guacamole, tacos, and bread pudding warranted an hour and 45 minute long dining experience, but maybe I&#39;m just antsy. 

I would probably try this place out again, but make sure that my tacos come with what they&#39;re supposed to. And hopefully there is a better waitstaff around too, the  service was pretty spotty."

The staff is very poorly motivated to help and the food was extremely just okay. To the people who don&#39;t know what real fine Mexican cuisine should taste like it may be pleasing but really the only thing worth remembering was the decor and the chips and salsa.

Loved the place.  Delicious echoes of Frontera Grill from the Rick Bayless acolyte, Chef Kike.  Terrific salsas, moles, guacamole, tacos, margaritas, and several terrific platos fuertes (entrees).  Loved, loved, loved the place.  We made sure we were there at least a couple times a month.

Unfortunately, our last couple of visits have been somewhat disappointing.  Portions have shrunk considerably, and several of the dishes seem to have lost their kick.  Has Chef Kike turned the kitchen over to a much less capable sous chef?  I&#39;m not sure what, exactly, is going on, but if this trend continues, I&#39;m afraid we will be writing this place off -- which would be really sad given how much I loved this place."

The tacos are so good that I haven&#39;t ventured too much farther on the menu during my four visits.  The bar has an excellent selection of tequila and an adequate selection of most other beverages.  The gold margarita is excellent.  I have been waiting to write this review until after trying Cine.  Last night was my first experience there, and now I must wonder what kind of herbs those who prefer Cine to this place are smoking.  Cine is more trendy and highly designed inside, but both spaces are attractive.  Cine has a slightly better bar selection.  Service seems about equal at both places, though both are relatively new and I&#39;ve seen staff missteps at both places.  At the end of everything, the determining factor for a restaurant must be the food, and in my opinion Aguamiel has *much* better food at a slightly cheaper price compared to Cine.  Aquamiel boasts a wide selection of amazing tacos, all of which can be mixed and matched.  The carnitas and pork belly are to die for, and the fried fish taco is the best of that genre I have ever tried.  I will be back.  Drive on in to downtown Clarendon Hills for the tacos here.  You will not be disappointed."

The menu looked interesting and a step beyond the normal suburban Mexican restaurant.  Six of us arrived early but were seated within five minutes of our reservation time.  The interior is trendy -  I thought I could be in a  small restaurant in River North. The place was packed. 

To start off, the obligatory chips seemed to be the same ones we get at Costco. First batch was served cold, the second batch was warm. The two salsas were good.  

I ordered the Al Pastor Tacos. I really enjoyed them. The taste of pineapple contrasted well with the meat, but the tacos were supposed to have &#34;crisp bacon&#34; but I could not taste nor see any bacon. This was one of the reasons I ordered these tacos.  The beans and rice were barely lukewarm. My wife had a mix of tacos. Two were good, the fish taco was rather poor - think &#34;fish sticks&#34;. Other meals were actually pretty good.

The service was inexcusable. We go out for fine dining at least once a month and this the worse service we have had in many years. The waiter was was pleasant enough and seemed knowledgeable about the menu , but was very absent minded and non-attentive. We ordered guacamole. It never came. I ordered  a drink, that did not come until I was well in to my meal, and the was after prompting the waiter. Many of the drinks were filled to the rim - which on one hand is nice. But my wife&#39;s drink spilled some and she cleaned up with the napkin - the waiter did not offer any assistance. We asked for a napkin. It never came - we grabbed one from another table. We went through the water and asked for another carafe. It never arrived.  Also, at a place like this I do not expect the meals to be auctioned when they are brought to the tables. So the last one is a bit petty but this there seemed to be  a trend.

Prices were very reasonable. The main dishes ran from $12 to upper 20&#39;s as I recall.
.
This place is also really loud - think Pappadeux and multiple times 2.  How about some fabrics to deafen the sound? 

I really wanted to like this restaurant. I suspect if I came back and had an experienced server this would be a 4-5 star review. Please train your staff or replace them and work out the kinks to insure the menu items arrive as advertized."

We had 5:30 reservations, and were seated right away which was good, but things went downhill from there. 

Service was terrible. My friend had to ask for a straw 4 times and even then she didn&#39;t get it. It took forever for our order to get to us, we watched many other tables who came in after us finish their meals before we got ours.Our server never came back to check on us after our food was delivered. 

The food was ok. We all agreed we&#39;ve had much better. I split the taco platter of six tacos with my husband, and our friends got three tacos and the enchiladas Mexicanos. The pork tacos were the best, everything else was pretty bland. The rice and beans had no flavor. It wasn&#39;t bad, it was just bland and nothing special. The pitcher of margaritas was very good. The guacamole was again bland.

It was good, but no more than that.  Wife liked the chicken in mole sauce a lot; I had the chiles rellenos, and they were were all right. The queso molida app was likewise, as far as I was concerned, just all right, too.  Didn&#39;t have dessert.  The margaritas were kind of watery, but then I&#34;m a straight-up vodka martini guy. The prices seem quite reasonable for the serving size and ambience.

My go-to Mexican in the CH area is still Taco Grill on Ogden a couple blocks west of Cass. Just a small lunch joint (though open for early dinner, too.)  A lot less fancy than Aguamiel, which is a very attractive  dining room with a very well-stocked and ornate bar, but I think TG food is much more flavorful. They have a good selection of routine Mex food, and the Tacos are especially good. Prices are a bit less than  Aguamiel.

I like TG&#39;s self-serve salsa bar, a selection of sixteen or so different, always-fresh salsas plus chiles, lime slices, and the like. They offer a pretty good bottled-beer selection along with soft drinks."

By the way I had to ask for more of the green sauce for the nachos because both my wife and I could not stop eating them. I plan to go back and take friends with me. The prices were reasonable and the service was great.

Opening weekend was crazy so I will reserve judgment on service as the first two times we went it was a little spotty.   The Baja and Carnitas tacos were amazing. The guacamole was top-notch.  I didn&#39;t notice it, but a friend said they were charged for a second basket of chips.  On the whole it&#39;s a pretty promising place but we&#39;ll have to see how it plays out.  Soda is out of bottles by the way, so no free refills."

But they were a bit inconsistent.  But I&#39;m going back.

Have a ceviche starter - definite low point of meal.  But good ambiance, guacamole was solid and three out of the four meals very well liked,  Taco plate is great though mix of 6 tacos is ALOT of food.  Pork loin dish I had had a great sauce though wish it was a fattier cut of meat.  Skirt steak was enjoyed and fourth had a seafood dish.  Desserts pretty blah - bread pudding almost always a win for me - blah.

Good prices, family friendly and not snotty atmosphere and enough outstanding dishes to make me think it might get to 4 ... but right now too much variance."

After moving from chicago to downers grove, I was still searching for a really good, authentic mexican restaurant.  I found it in Aguamiel.  
The fresh ingredients to the fun cocktails all make for a delicious meal.  I keep going back for the tacos but need to branch out and try some other dishes - everything sounds so good.  
The restaurant can get crowded and now that word is out I feel reservations are a must.  But it&#39;s got a good atmosphere and love that it&#39;s not a cookie cutter chain restaurant.  Prices seem like a great value especially considering the nicer neighborhood.  I hope this place is here to stay as it&#39;s my new favorite!"

Three of us plus a toddler dined (early) and enjoyed all of our food choices. The guacamole was fresh and delicious and I enjoy the green salsa though just not a fan of chipotle salsas myself. We shared a 1/2 pitcher of house margarita which was fantastic. I didn&#39;t think it was too sweet or sour. We also had one of the top shelf margaritas last time which was the best, but knocked us on our a$$! :) 

I had the chicken mole based on the reviews-  it was delicious. It wasn&#39;t what I was expecting at all, but so good I nearly licked the plate clean. The other two in the party shared the 6 taco platter. This was a good deal b/c it came with rice and a side of guac, which I think the plate of 3 does not. Much more authentic food than many other places around, but refreshing if your husband wants to drag you to the Taco Grill and Salsa Bar again.

We had great service, very attentive and nice. So why not 5 stars? I love my chips and salsa and while good, it is not great.  I like a place that I can hang at the bar  for a margarita and abundant salsa. I can barely fit my chip in the little bowl. I will be back to try some of the other items and other margaritas. Looks like they have a good space for larger groups too."

The first visit was just after they opened so service was spotty and the place was packed.  We&#39;ve been back 2-3 times since and have tried many items from the menu.
Guacamole is very fresh tasting and good.   Portion is on the small side. They bring chips and two very small dishes of salsa, one red, one green.  Chips are good if on the salty side.
My favorite dishes would be the chicken tinga and the chicken enchiladas in a mole sauce.
My husband had the carne asada, and it was very good as well.
The margaritas were a little too sweet for my taste, I like them more tart.  Sangria is pretty good.  Service has been much improved on subsequent visits."

The service was good and the food arrived in a timely manner. I&#39;m a vegetarian so I was pleased to have a lot of options. They were accommodating with my restrictions. I order the tacos with mushrooms, onions, cheese, and peppers. Tasty but not greasy.

My husband, on the other hand, will eat anything. I think he got a pork or chicken mole which he liked.

My only negatives were:

The guacamole was bland. It needed more kick but that&#39;s a personal preference which is a simple fix.

Also, we weren&#39;t happy with our desserts. We ordered the churros which were served in a cold chocolate sauce and a bread pudding that was served cold.

I also agree with other posts about the chips and salsa. That was an unexpected surprise.

All in all we were happy with the experience!"

It was very crowded and the layout of the bar made it difficult to find a place to wait where we weren&#39;t in the way of the waitstaff in the back or standing in the open doorway.  The bar staff (of 1) seemed completely overwhelmed.  Luckily another set of hands hopped in to help out, but while that helped the speed of service, we didn&#39;t get the margarit&#39;s we actually ordered, but instead got the standard house version. They were ok, but we are not fans of the sour-mix margarita, so we did not get off to a good start.

We did get seated in the time estimated, which was a pleasant surprise. And the chips and salsa arrived promptly.  The chips were clearly homemade and very fresh and the salsa was good as well.

They clearly were open a little too soon, as the menus were paper copies and we informed that the bar could not actually make our 1st 2 drink choices.  We then went back to ordering a fairly standard margarita, though with premium tequila and lime juice v sourmix and these were very good.

The highlight of the night was however, the food.  We were excited that the exec chef had experience at Frontera/Topolobampo and that was evident from the food.  I had the pork tenderloin which was tender and flavorful.  My husband went with the chicken mole and was more than pleased.  It was nice to be in a Mexican restaurant that didn&#39;t have a standard Pepe&#39;s/Uncle Julio&#39;s-style menu.

We did order another round of margaritas, which never arrived (luckily we didn&#39;t get charged for them either, though we did see the drinks they couldn&#39;t make appear on the bill).  We noticed and experienced a rather long wait time to take our order, come back to ask about dessert, deliver our bill, and refill our water glasses (which never happened).

So, there are obviously some servie issues which need to be worked out, but the quality of the food and reasonableness of the prices should definitely make you want to give it a try.  We will be returning in a few weeks to see if they&#39;ve gotten the kinks worked out.  The food is well worth it.  This is a great addition to the dining choices in the Western Suburbs."

We were looking for somewhere different to stop and have a margarita. We decide to drive to Clarendon Hills. We new we went to a place there before, but couldn&#39;t remember the name. We saw Aguamiel and stopped in for some beverages. We always sit at the bar when we go out on saturdays for a little social time. The two bartenders were good and made us some good ole drinks.

The bartender was friendly and took our drink order.  After that he ignored us and finally someone else came through for us to ask if we could have a menu.  Finally we ordered.  Then had to flag someone down for another glass of wine.  A very nice waitress came behind the bar to help this bartender who seems to be too busy to watch anyone at the bar.  I ordered the steak tacos, and they were pretty good, although the meat didn&#39;t taste fresh, the sauce the steak marinated in was good.  It took 2 separate people to finally get our bill, and we were charged for something that wasn&#39;t even ours.  The food is decent, but the service is horrible.

On our first visit my only negative comment was that they lacked a desert heavy in chocolate as I&#39;m a chocolate nut.

Chips and salsa arrived quickly (salsa portions are tiny), and we split the half order of margaritas which was fine for 3 adults as we each had a glass, and I had a second.  My wife ordered guacamole and chips which is NOT worth the price, as the portion size is small even by kids standards.  Apparently a LOT of people have complained about this to the manager, but nothing has changed.  They should listen to their customers or we can easily find other options, especially in this area.  I ordered 3 tacos, all different and all very good, though the shrimp was a bit spicy.  My wife did the same.  Kids ordered the tortilla classica soup and loved it, then had tacos and chicken strips as entrees.  Chicken strips are not what you think, but actually much better than the breaded chicken pieces you normally see on a kids menu....this is a pounded thin chicken breast that is very lightly breaded and cooked.  My son ate all of it.  We did not get dessert, and bill was very reasonable.  The place was very crowded but Tara at the hostess station was very friendly and sat us right away.  They handled the crowd well and the noise level was fine, even though it was full.  Nothing to complain about at all...in fact, we will be there again tonight."

The first time we came, there was an incident with our food. The waitress immediately solved the problem and comped our entire bill after remaking all of our meal. I thought that was an excellent show of service! I had ordered the Naper skillet and my husband had a corned beef skillet. Both were okay, but neither tasted as exciting as the menu made it sound. 

We returned another time and had a veggie omelet. The waitress we had this time (different) was also amazing and super friendly. The kitchen forgot the cheese on my omelet, so she brought me out a little dish of it on request. The omelet this time was very tasty and better than others I&#39;ve had.

I think this place has a few kitchen kinks to work out, but the service has been excellent both times, and the menu has potential. Prices are good given the quality of the food, but portions are responsible and on the smaller side.

I had the chicken waffles.  Really well made.  The other dishes looked terrific.  

Also had the homemade pumpkin coffee cake.  It was so good but also too rich. (I wish I saved it for dessert)

Throw in some fried chicken and fresh made biscuits and we have a winner! I had leftovers for the next day and I was very happy about that!

The boy ordered the Meat Eaters Omelet and Toast with Homemade Strawberry Jam. I&#39;ve never seen him order an omelet! He really liked it and the jam was great! He also had leftovers and was happy he did since he had to work on Sunday!

Our server was kind and helpful, explaining the specials and highlighting favorite items. I tried a cup of the cream of chicken &amp; rice soup and it was very tasty. For my meal, I had the biscuits and gravy with fried chicken and it was awesome. Fluffy homemade biscuits, rich sausage gravy and a perfectly cooked, crispy fried boneless chicken breast with two eggs over easy. Decadent, huge portion, not too salty/greasy, just perfect. My mom got an omelette with a morning glory square on the side which was an interesting menu item, kind of carrot-cake-y but with a banana bread texture. Really good! My husband got the chicken and waffles which was actually amazing, the malted waffle batter might have been my favorite thing at the whole table and I got swatted away more than once sneaking extra bites of that awesome waffle. Our server was kind, prompt, knowledgeable of the menu and seemed to really take pride in the items on the menu, pointing out to us that the coffee cakes are baked in house and even gesturing over to the cook who makes them. I thought this was a nice touch.

Today I ventured in around lunch time so opted for a burger. Went with the California Burger complete with avocado, mixed greens and provolone cheese, to which I added garlic aioli and crispy bacon. The burger was cooked a perfect medium rare and came with some house made fries that were crunchy and tasty. Throw in an iced tea and that&#39;s a pretty damn good lunch.

But the best part was Penny and her hospitality. She knew my name and came and sat down again to visit. And then she let me taste test a new item she&#39;s working on that includes waffles, house made chorizo, an egg and chipotle creme and salsa verde. It was pretty tasty and definitely unique. Can&#39;t wait to see it on the menu. 

Also nice to see a little crowd on hand at lunch time. Penny visited with each customer and the other folks who taste tested also gave it thumbs up.

We enjoyed the establishment before this one and its recent change of owners so decided to come back and give this new restaurant a shot. 

Upon walking in, we immediately notice this restaurant is busy. There were only a handful of open tables, but we were quickly greeted and seated. The restaurant is very clean and the staff is extremely friendly. The specials are listed on a large board at the back of the restaurant and I quickly noticed many of their dishes have a Southwestern flair, containing ingredients such as chorizo or accompanied by salsa. They have traditional American breakfast dishes as well, but I chose to go outside of the box and order the Carintas Waffles:Topped with slow cooked, perfectly seasoned pulled pork, chipotle crema, salsa verde, cojita cheese, and fresh cilantro. There is no need for syrup. At first glance, this sounds pretty weird, but I really, really enjoyed this dish! It comes with a heaping ton of carnitas and the chipotle crema and salsa verde is the perfect accompaniment to the fresh, warm waffle. I would recommend trying this creative dish if you&#39;re looking for something different!

I&#39;d also like to add kudos to this place for trying oh-so-hard for business: we noticed the staff was highly attentive, including whom I assume to be the owner, refilling coffee and working tables. They&#39;ve also done a great job with their website for being a smaller restaurant, with appetizing pictures of their menu selections and detailed descriptions so my boyfriend and I knew exactly what we had to look forward to before even arriving! 

Great job, keep up the good work and delicious food, and we can&#39;t wait to come back!"

During the busy workweek, I don&#39;t always have the option (read never have the option) to sit down and enjoy breakfast.  On the weekends, I strive to have one sit-down breakfast on the weekend.

This is the place Naperville has been missing.  It&#39;s a small hidden treasure of food nirvana.  Everything else in the area feels the same, but this is a locally owned and operated breakfast destination.  

I&#39;ve been here a handful of times.  The first few were scouting expeditions, prior to introducing my wife to the goodness that awaits behind the hidden, yet blatantly obvious entrance.  Once you walk in the door, you&#39;re greeted by a member of the friendly staff.  It might be the host.  If the host is busy seating someone else, it might be a server.  Seemingly there&#39;s no &#34;this is your job, this is my job&#34;.  No waiting for &#34;your server&#34; to refill your coffee.  Every person I&#39;ve dealt with has been very friendly and helpful.  

Let&#39;s talk food...

It&#39;s all good.  I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve eaten everything - I&#39;ve only been there 5-6 times.  Most everything is homemade (it might all be homemade).  The corned beef hash...if you remotely like corned beef hash - get it.  Biscuits 

The portions are decently sized.  Not crazy-assed Texas sized portions that seem to be the trend.  The eggs are actually cooked to your preference.  I&#39;ve been a few places where &#34;over-medium&#34; = &#34;way less than over-easy&#34;.  

Can we talk homemade jams?  Or is it jelly?  What&#39;s the difference again?  What ever the smashed-fruit goodness that you put on toast for breakfast dessert is called...that in itself if almost worth the trip.  

At the end of your meal and the check comes. If you want to bring it to the cashier - go for it.  If you want the server to do it - also an option.  Love. It."

My boyfriend and I were looking for a good breakfast place by my house at Ogden and Washington. We saw the reviews on yelp and decided to try Lucky Penny, great decision! It&#39;s a cute place directly in the corner of the strip mall. You might not notice it driving by and that would be a shame. 

The walls have art by local artists and more than a few caught our eye. Our server was named Anjie and she was very nice and attentive. 

We both got a make-your-own-skillet and were very impressed. The ingredients were all very fresh and both of our scrambled eggs were cooked perfectly. We both opted to pay the extra dollar for coffee cakes instead of the toast and they blew us away! Do NOT miss out on the coffee cake, it&#39;s homemade. I got the Bavarian cream and he got the blueberry, both were phenomenal. My mom makes good coffee cake and this beat it hands down. I also got a mimosa which was very good. You gotta love a nice mimosa on your day off!

All in all we loved it! We&#39;ll definitely be coming back, (Now just to make up an excuse to eat out as soon as possible). I hear they also make their own jam. I can&#39;t wait to try it!"

From the outside, it doesn&#39;t look like much, but once you open those doors, what a gem! The food is outstanding and so fresh. The vibe is great, the staff is friendly and courteous, and now they offer mimosas and bloody marys! 

We had Tracey as our waitress and she was very sweet and attentive. I ordered the biscuit and gravy breakfast that included hash browns and got cheese/onion added + a side of egg whites. The hash browns were perfectly cooked just the way I liked them (without me even asking), the eggs whites were beautifully scrambled with a light butter taste and were sooo fluffy, and the biscuits and gravy were out of this world. I could eat this breakfast 3 more times this week! The portions are perfect and the price is spot on. 

This place offers a vast array of different items on their menu. For those pumpkin lovers, they have everything pumpkin for you. Their flavors seem to change daily (or maybe weekly, not sure) for things like coffee cake, which is great. My friend had coffee cake and it looks great and was a HUGE piece! I was amazed at the items on the menu in such a small place such as wilted spinach with all kinds of fancy toppings. Seriously, this place is such a treasure in Naperville. I will be back again and again!!"

It is a small but comfortable restaurant.  The food here is your typical breakfast fare.  I was expecting something a bit more unique for some reason. I ordered their pancakes which I normally do at a new breakfast restaurant. Also a 1/2 order of biscuits and gravy just to do a little taste test and a side of sausage patties.

When it came time to serve our meal the staff seemed a bit unorganized as they handed out my order to three different people and forgot parts of others.  As I gathered my meal with a chuckle I tended to my pancakes which were large and fluffy looking but unfortunately they were rather dry and crumbly once I dug into them.  The breakfast sausage patties were thin and unremarkable. The biscuits and gravy was fairly weak on flavor and thin on sausage. 

My wife&#39;s waffle came with a huge glob of butter in the middle. Most restaurants usually only serve their waffles with powdered sugar.  My wife hates the taste of butter so this put a damper on her meal immediately.

Other guest in our party were also &#34;meh&#34; about the restaurant so I guess it is unlikely that we will be coming back in the near future.  Too bad because it seems like a nice cozy local place."

Sourdough with ham, blueberry jam (what?!), and a fried egg. Very unique, very flavorful. My husband had a scramble and I had a bite -- onions were actually completely cooked and nicely diced (it&#39;s a pet peeve of mine in diners when they onions are still hard and unevenly chopped). Portions were just right, and we left feeling happy. We were there on a quiet weekday morning, and the service was great -- not a typical breakfast rush experience, but we&#39;d definitely go back."

I miss Ken and Wilma. They ran a great business, where they served a good plate of food at a frugal price, and always served it with a smile.

That said, the food was still good, and the prices were not outrageous, but they weren&#39;t a super bargain anymore. They expanded the menu to allow for more unique meals, but they hipstered-up the prices for a plate of eggs to match the new menu.

Not bad at all, but not going to be my go-to for a quick simple breakfast."

The menu has a lot to offer, with multiple daily specials. We ordered the Greek omelette and gave it two thumbs up. My son ordered day chicken waffles, which was unique and tasty. My daughter got the standard silver dollar pancakes off the kids menu and loved it. 

Overall, everyone felt that the portion sizes were large and satisfying.

The pros are the friendly service, large selection on the menu, Taste of the food, and cleanliness.

The only con I see is that the coffee is watered down and the taste is decent but not great."

Management is super friendly and dedicated.  I can honestly say I&#39;ve never felt more at home in a restaurant than at Penny&#39;s.  I get more personal attention from the wait staff here than at many fine dining restaurants.

I ate a skillet hash browns with veggies. I loved that the potatoes were not greasy. The homemade peach-mango jam on sourdough was scrumptious, as was the homemade salsa verde.

We were not pleased with our meal and won&#39;t be back.  We went about 9:30ish in the morning, it was not busy, a few open tables and more open booths.

There seemed to be confusion when we walked in the door, another couple was behind us and they were trying seat us together. We got seated with just our party and a waitress asked about drinks.  We only had one coffee cup on the table so my husband got his cup of coffee right away, I asked for decaf and a milk for my LO. Another waitress came up and again asked us what we wanted to drink, had to ask for drinks again.  I was looking at the menu to see if there was a kids menu, the guy who seated us didn&#39;t give us one, one of the waitresses brought us the kids menu with crayons.  

Food - considering the place was not super busy, it took longer than expected to get our food.  I had ordered the two eggs (scrambled) with meat (bacon).  My meal was supposed to come with either hash browns or fruit, the waitress didn&#39;t ask which one I wanted when I ordered, the default is usually hash browns, but neither were on my plate when it was served, we had to ask for it, I got a nice side of fresh fruit.  I asked for pancakes, instead of toast.  I thought it was weird there was a $1 up charge for basic pancakes.  We go out to breakfast and have tried multiple breakfast joints in Naperville and never seen an up charge for basic pancakes.  Overall, my meal was just ok.  My scrambled eggs were a little over done and the bacon was just ok.

I ordered the one egg kids meal for my LO, it came with an egg, meat and starch (toast or pancake).  The meal was sufficient for my LO but when we got the bill, it showed an up charge of $2 for bacon.  The bill was corrected but I am glad I checked everything.

Hubby ordered a make your own skillet and upgraded his toast with the blueberry coffee cake.  He liked the coffee cake but didn&#39;t care for the skillet, and it wasn&#39;t the ingredients he added.

Overall, food was just mediocre.  Before I was done with my food, I stated I didn&#39;t want to come back and my husband said he had already decided we wouldn&#39;t be back and he is the man who eats anything and almost never complains."

I&#39;ve lived near this location for years and have seen a few restaurants come and go. If my first experience is any indication, I think Lucky Penny is going to be my favorite cafe that&#39;s been in this spot.

The owner, Penny, served my breakfast, kept my coffee fresh, and chatted with me. Her passion for her work was apparent from the start; I felt very welcome, and I could tell she was excited and proud of her food. It&#39;s always so cool to see someone passionate about what they do. I still miss my dearly departed Wicked Good Caf√©, and this was the first time since then that I&#39;ve found a place that&#39;s as warm and friendly as they were.

I had eggs benedict, hash browns, and coffee. The serving size is generous - I need to keep that in mind and order light when I go in so early in the morning. When I get restaurant hash browns, I honestly don&#39;t expect much, but these were carefully seasoned; the salt-and-pepper blend made them special. The eggs benedict had strips of ham instead those fried discs that many restaurants use, so they were cooked evenly and were tastier. I think there was some paprika in the sauce; it was yummy.

The coffee was a standout. I take two creams and half a sugar in my coffee, so when Penny refilled it partway through my first cup, I thought I would need to add more of both. Instead, it was so smooth and mild that I put away 2 or 2 1/2 cups without having to add any more flavoring. Very impressed with the coffee.

It always feels so satisfying to support a local business, and I&#39;m so pleased to have a high-quality one right near my house. Highly recommended."

The chocolate chip pancakes were over portioned (3 full plate-sized). My daughter thought the music was ahead of it&#39;s time with the geriatric crowd. All in all a very mixed experience. I will probably try it again, lunch next time."

We sat in the back room here.  The dear little waitress confused my drink order twice.  Their older and wiser bartender came out to see me for clarification.  Who does that?  Who cares enough to check?  I kept saying &#34;martini&#34; and the young server kept hearing &#34;Margarita,&#34; but that&#39;s okay.  She was adorable and tried her best.  The owner seemed an interesting chap.  Older guy.  Between 65 and 75, I&#39;d guess.  Looked like Alan Hale, Sr. playing an old Navy cook in a Van Heflin movie.  He took a seat at &#34;his&#34; table toward the rear.  Most restaurants have an owner&#39;s table tucked somewhere.  One of the kitchen boys brought him his lunch and asked if everything looked okay.  A gruff nod was offered in response.  He sipped a small glass of beer as he munched and read the paper by himself.  An older couple approached as they left.  The woman asked if he was the owner.  He admitted as much.  She told him how much she enjoyed the food.  I thought that was nice of her.  I need to give a good word in person more often.  Alan Hale, Sr. smiled and mumbled his thanks.  Give this place a try."

I won&#39;t mention her name but we were outside on the patio and she hardly ever came out. Young, cute blonde girl but a terrible waitress. My friend finally went inside at one point and he said there was hardly anyone in there but she was talking to someone. I think her boyfriend was there. I will certainly keep coming back but not if she is waiting on me. Too bad that the bar is so small.

We got seated right away on a Friday evening in their outdoor dining space, which was a big plus, but there were a bunch of kids running around and yelling, which sours my opinion of the experience (I know that&#39;s not the restaurant&#39;s fault).  

I would say it was an average dining experience... I wouldn&#39;t recommend it as a featured dining destination and probably wouldn&#39;t go back myself as it&#39;s a bit of a drive, but if I lived in Batavia or close by I might."

I try to fit in with the cool cats and often wear my beret, dark shades and a black turtle neck  and get my &#34;kicks&#34; as I sip the Craft Brew of the day.

I&#39;m a local and frequent this Shack just enough to make the scene. I admit that the Craft Beer Choice here is unlimited and ever changing, however how many can actually be tasty? I&#39;ve tasted everything from effervescent to shades of old bland motor oil and all points in between. Never get attached to a flavor of choice, because it&#39;s probably not available on your next visit.

Service can be a bit slow when they&#39;re busy, but everyone has been super friendly. And very sweet to a generally hungry and wanting-food-right-now 7YO, which is a huge bonus. We never feel rushed here. 

The pizza is cracker thin and crispy. I don&#39;t usually like it that way - but it&#39;s good here (I tried the Margarita) and I&#39;d order it again. BBQ is on point. Burgers are tasty - and served with a cold beer, all is right with the world. 

Outdoor and indoor seating - and the outdoor seating is covered. Bonus, because random Chicagoland weather.

My only dream wish would be for them to carry reaslieng white wine that is sweet such as St Michele type. ( would make my wife happy). You know what they say happy wife you will have a happy life and a fun time.

Last time we went, we sat at the bar until our table was ready. The bartender is very knowledgeable and didn&#39;t hesitate to let us try several kinds of beers before deciding on what we wanted. He seems like a good hometown bartender. 

The chili is fantastic, and is definitely something I would order again. We never leave hungry and the prices are great. Gammon Coach House is occasionally on restaurant.com, which is how we found it in the first place."

Their Bloody Mary&#39;s are fantastic though, and their food is excellent. I&#39;ve experienced their Grilled Cheese, which has cheese on the outside of the sandwich, too. M built his own pizza on our first visit with bacon, pepperoni, and jalapenos. 

On our most recent visit, we again got our Bloody Mary&#39;s. He decided to build his own omelette with pepper jack and bleu cheese, bacon, and jalapenos. I wasn&#39;t in the mood for breakfast, so I ordered the hot dog with everything with tator tots. Our waitress asked me &#34;Everything?&#34; I answered affirmatively, but then she asked about mushrooms and I said &#34;hell no&#34; but in different words and more politely. After she left, I wondered who the hell would put mushrooms on a hot dog? Ewww. I&#39;m pretty sure she was joking around but still....

When our food was brought out, I shit you not, all I saw was a mound of toppings. It was awesome! A beautiful quarter pound hot dog with lettuce, pico de gallo, huge pickles sliced round, a beautiful slice of pepper jack cheese, and god knows what else, but it was delicious. It was quite filling paired with the tator tots. M successfully ate every scrap of his breakfast. As I watched his eyes roll into the back of his head, I knew a nap was in his immediate future. 

I can&#39;t comment on the inside, as we&#39;ve always sat out on the patio, but that&#39;s where I prefer to be. As others have said, it&#39;s a bit hard to find if you&#39;re not familiar with the area, and your first attempt to park can be confusing as well. But once you make your way inside (or sit down on the patio), expect nothing but great food, great drinks, prompt friendly service, and overall a wonderful experience."

Just $5 on Monday, it&#39;s a deal you simply cannot beat.  Pulled chicken sandwich with buffalo sauce?  Forget dessert just give me two of these.  Tater tots are pretty standard fare for a restaurant, but they recently had a BBQ Apple Cider sauce mixture on the table that made these absolutely incredible.

Awesome beer selection with a lot of local favorites.  They switch up the selection to make it seasonal, meaning a once-a-month visitor will always have something new to try.

Avoid the Batavia Bulldog unless you can pull down a few hundred dollars in bets to finish the thing.  Hot dog wrapped in bacon deep fried and covered in chili.  Don&#39;t expect to get out of bed the next day, and move your bed to the bathroom.  A fun dare for your enemies."

We&#39;re headed back to Bartlett from the Aurora Premium Outlets. Hunger strikes!  Gammon Coach House is basically on our way home and so our lunch problem appears to be solved. 

We entered the somewhat cramped establishment with pretty low expectations. What we experienced was the exact opposite. Success!

It was a cold October afternoon, so no one was eating out on the patio. It is a nice additional space for seating though. We had the option of bar seating, a table on the bar side or any one of the six or so tables on the other side. We went to the least crowded area on the other side and made ourselves comfortable.

Our server was very sweet. Unnecessary side note: She was a hired server at Jenny McCarthy&#39;s Halloween Party in Geneva the night before and couldn&#39;t get all of the professional vampire makeup off of herself. She was kind enough to let us know that she wasn&#39;t in a car accident or anything like that earlier and that it was just makeup. It made for great conversation with her!  And we&#39;re back to your regularly scheduled review...

We started with chips &amp; salsa and onion rings. The salsa was homemade and quite good. The onion rings stole the show!  Crisp beer batter that wasn&#39;t too heavy. Those were delicious!!

We tried the chili and the chicken tortilla soup. Both were obviously made fresh and really tasty. My beef?  The chicken tortilla soup was loaded with cheese...and it didn&#39;t say that on the menu. I scooped out what I could and proceeded to eat. No crunchy tortilla strips here. Fresh corn tortilla pieces throughout with chicken breast chunks. Woo hoo!!

Around the table were patty melts, a grilled cheese and a burger with fries, tater tots and sweet potato tater tots as the side dishes.  The burgers were hand packed and served on bakery type buns. Actually all of the bread was bakery quality. The sweet potato tater tots seem to be their own creation while the fries and regular tater tots were your standard frozen variety that weren&#39;t exciting.  I think I read that someone said that you don&#39;t come here for the food. I totally disagree. I&#39;d make the effort to come back for the food. I might even order the same meal sans cheese of course!  

Everyone around the table was pleased with the food. And the beer menu was extensive. We weren&#39;t drinking, but there was a nice variety available. The only other complaint was that although we had good attention during the meal, we think we may have been forgotten about in the side room once we were done eating. We had to eventually go ask our server for a box and the check. Not a huge problem, but the layout is not conducive to being able to see everything from one room to the next. 

I&#39;m sorry that we didn&#39;t try a homemade dessert. I should have saved room. Next time?  Aw yeah!"

The person I was meeting got lost and I followed as my GPS told me to turn and it was THERE, well it wasn&#39;t but then I figured I&#39;d pull in where the little stores were and I found it.

As for seating, there is a patio, a bar area, and back room.  The place has great atmosphere!  The menu is limited which is a good thing because too much to choose from just makes for a complicated meal sometimes ya know?!  What you get here is craft beer and comfort food - makes for a great lunch!

There is a craft beer menu, and the beers come in three sizes.  If you&#39;re unsure of what to order, they will give you a tasting of the beer which was super nice because I have very little knowledge of beer outside my comfort zone.  

I ordered a patty melt with tater tots - it was a good size, very tasty and not at all greasy as patty melts can be.  My friend ordered the spaghetti dinner special - it was a good size portion for around $8.

Visually, the place isn&#39;t much to look at.  A small bar with a few tables on the inside with outdoor patio.  Since it was in the upper 60&#39;s for March, we dined on the patio.  Service was excellent but it wasn&#39;t overly busy for Monday night at 6.  

They have 2 menus, one for food &amp; one for beer.  That&#39;a a good sign in my opinion.  Let&#39;s talk brew frist.    They had probably 30-40 craft/micro beers to choose from with others on tap.  Kelly &amp; I ordered a couple beers.  I tried a new one that sounded good but didn&#39;t like it at all.  I ordered a more familiar beer that I enjoy.  They were out of it but the waitress brought a sample of a beer on tap that was similar that I enjoyed so I ordered that.  Nice.  She  also removed the bad beer from the bill!  Kelly enjoyed her beer but we didn&#39;t order another since she wanted to get home to prepare for the trip. 

As for the grub, it&#39;s a smaller food menu with your usual bar/American fare.  Since burger was on special (&amp; the lone guy outside had one that looked great), I ordered that &amp; the sweet tater tots.  Kelly ordered a corned beef reuben.  Food came out quickly &amp; was very good.  My burder was very tasty with a great brioche bun.  The sweet tater tots were spot on but needed a little salt for my liking.  Kelly said her reuben was the best one she&#39;d ever had.   The check came quickly after we were done &amp; was taken care of in under 5 minutes.  

All in all, it was a very enjoyable, affordable, unpretentious,  comfortable dining experience with great service!  We&#39;ll be happy to go back &amp; try some of the other, simpler tastier items the other customers had."

Cutesy old house with teas and sandwiches? Nay. Hidden dive-gem of the western suburbs. How can a beer and bar-food enthusiast not totally dig this place?

Beer menu = really good. Lots of stuff you can find in most decent beer bars, but a good selection of the finer craft brews. They had Scurry by Off Color Brewing on nitro, which tasted excellent. They also had some brews from Solemn Oath, Deschutes, Lagunitas, Left Hand, Stone, and Three Floyds on draft. There were other good selections available in bottles/cans, like Founders, Oskar Blues, Revolution, Great Lakes, Church Street, and Two Bros. Good to see they support local brews! They had a tap for Penrose hanging on the ceiling, and that place isn&#39;t even open yet (soon to be in Geneva, I believe). 

Anyway, beer was good, right? No Miller Lites or lawnmower beers. Lots of whiskey and bourbon to choose from, and a couple ciders available (not Woodchuck). I think that any craft beer lover would be happy. ALSO, you can get a 6oz beer, if you want to try a few beers instead of drinking one or two large pints. It&#39;s a nice option, if you aren&#39;t sure what you want a lot of, or if you just are in the variety sort of mood.

Food, woah. They have a grilled cheese with CHEESE on the OUTSIDE. It&#39;s crisped on the outside of the bread, so don&#39;t expect something oozy-gooey on the outside, but don&#39;t be dismayed. It&#39;s really good and flavorful. We added grilled mushrooms, grilled onions, tomato, and bacon. This thing was overflowing but not gross or messy. Lots of flavor without an obscene amount of cheese. We split that, and then also split the Patty Melt. It was fairly standard...homemade burger patty on toasted, marbled rye, swiss, and grilled onions. The burger was a bit more than medium, but it was juicy, so no complaints. If I had to pick a winner, I&#39;d vote for the grilled cheese, but I&#39;m not sorry I ordered the patty melt.

THOSE FRIES THOUGH. They look like boring-@ss fries, but don&#39;t be fooled. My husband ordered sweet potato tots and was a sorry sucka. He didn&#39;t finish his tots and was picking from my pile of carby, salty french fries. Not too thick, not too thin, with a crunchy outside and fluffy inside. Fried to perfection, and you get a lot. Yummmmm.

Cory behind the bar was friendly and knowledgable. Everything was prompt and he checked back on us frequently. He even asked &#34;Does everything taste great?&#34; assuming that the found was excellent (which it was). Glad to see this place and its quality inspires confidence in its employees. 

I&#39;ll be back here. There are other items on the menu that I NEED to try, plus they have rotating specials, like spaghetti, ribs, tacos, etc. Their beer menu is rotating, and its nice to see that they have it posted on their website. Drop in for a plentiful basket of bar food and some local brews."

Why you ask? 3 reasons: 1) hard to leave for less than $25 even if you&#39;re just having beers, 2) the food is ordinary, and not many options for vegetarians, and 3) the most important, they have one of the all time rudest servers, yet she is there ALL the time. Can&#39;t stand her. So much I don&#39;t go just in case I have her. One of the only people I don&#39;t tip 20%. Otherwise the staff is great."

(Who wouldn&#39;t??!!)  Luckily, when we showed up, GCH had a few tables available on the decent sized patio at a first come basis.  

Their menu isn&#39;t huge, but they are great at what is on the menu. For an app, we split the Mini Calzones.  We both LOVED them.  Little fried cheesy sausage pockets with a red sauce that stands on it&#39;s own.  It reminded my wife of the &#34;PIzza Fritte&#34; back home in CT.  (Or at least the closest thing to it).  Regardless, it was great.

As for our mains;

She had Grilled Chicken with a side salad.  GC was good, side salad dressing was awesome.

I had the Patty Melt with everything.  OMG!  Their caramelized onions are superb!  

Service was solid too!

I highly recommend Gammon Coach House whenever in the Bat-a-via area."

It is small and dark but they have one of the best beer list in the area. They even let you try a sample of the beer if you&#39;re not sure that you&#39;d like it before you buy. the food is very good although I had the ribs the other day and they were just so-so. They were kind of fatty and they are not cooked in a barbecue sauce. We&#39;ve had other dishes there and had no problems also it is one of the few places that still serves tater tots or sweet potato tots. but definitely a great place to stop by for a beer and a bite. The staff has always been friendly and the food is moderately priced. they even have a patio although looking over the parking lot, available when the weather is nice. Definitely worth a try and a good place to try a different kind of you especially if you are not the Miller Lite or Budweiser type."

We sat inside and looking out of the window it felt like we were sitting inside a nice lodge enjoying great drinks and friends.  No cell phones not a lot of TVs for distractions.  Just great beer and a cozy atmosphere.  Many craft beers to choose from and great owners.  

On this night we were here a customer was stumbling on his way out. The bartender went outside to check if this patron was driving. He was planning on driving and the owner instead had an employee get in his car and follow the owner who drove the customers car home In a blizzard. That is beyond going the extra mile.  Happy to have this place close to home.  Cheers!"

(Look it up) Anyway, everything about this place was good! We didn&#39;t know what to expect, as from the outside of the building, it doesn&#39;t look like much; Really, it&#39;s not. It&#39;s kinda cramped, but the atmosphere and decor make up for a lot of it. 

They have a good selection of beverages, and even though the food menu was limited, everything that we received on it was great. 

The service was top-notch, but with a place that small, you really can&#39;t screw it up!

My one suggestion to the owners would be to fix the light in the bathroom. It&#39;s on a motion sensor, and while doing my business and while washing my hands it turned off. The first time it happened I almost shat myself...but thankfully I was in the right place to do it."

The food selection is amazing, especially rib nights on Saturdays and the sweet potato tater tots. The menu covers everything from fish and chips to pulled chicken to monster salads.

But what really got me hooked was the beer selection. I signed up for their text notification club, and get a text whenever a new beer is tapped. Most of my visits were because of those texts. Their beer selection is mix of local mainstay (3 Floyds, Revolution, Two Brothers) and some from the outer reaches of the galaxy (Portland, generally). There is a variety of sizes, so you don&#39;t have to break the bank to try something new.

There are a few downsides. The inside is kind of cramped and dark. There is a good amount of seating, but if you&#39;re waiting for a table on a busy night, there&#39;s nowhere to stand that&#39;s out of the way. I always had to do the shuffle dance with incoming guests. This also means the wait can get kind of long, but a good beer is an easy remedy. Downsides, yes. Deal-breakers, not on  your life.

I&#39;ll put it this way- when my down-the-street lease was up, I almost didn&#39;t move purely because of the Gammon Coach House."
gammon-coach-house-batavia,Jessica G.,M4FeQH6Ykr9FJb0PfmwNkw,"Villa Park, IL",0,1,0,70,14,SfWWNDLiQ9b9KGjADLd97Q,4.0,2013-07-13,"This is a solid 4 for the beverage menu.  

** I haven&#39;t tried the food and from what I understand, it&#39;s pretty standard bar fare.  I don&#39;t think you should go there to eat, though - I think you should go there to enjoy fantastic beverages.  Because nobody should drink bad beer, IMO.  

Belly up to the bar or, if it&#39;s nice outside, go and sit at one of the tables on the little patio.  This is not a large place - it might be kind of crowded.  Either way, you will find a fairly random, and yet fantastic, assortment of beers.  It&#39;s not exactly what one would expect for the looks of the place or the location.  Keep in mind, at least from yesterday to today, the beer menu on the website is only a portion of what they had in last night.  It seems like a place to go to see what is new and interesting, which is a good thing in my book.  I mean who else has bottles of the Game of Thrones beer?

I also like that you can get a sample size, a slightly larger size or a regular-sized pour of beer.  I like to try all the things so it&#39;s nice to be able to try a lot of different tastes without being stuck with something I don&#39;t like.  

Decent service and the bartender was both funny and had really good recommendations.  A definite bonus, though the service outside on the patio might have been a little odd, though not terrible.

If this place wasn&#39;t so far away, I could see it being a pretty regular hangout."
gammon-coach-house-batavia,Tom K.,UGplAYsYC65eE83ADoZ2Jw,"Batavia, IL",0,1,1,17,17,pfiicvkRJJq1SYT5900_yQ,4.0,2011-09-08,"UPDATE: the cook now uses a subtle bell when orders are up. They added hat/coat/purse hooks at your bar seats that are very convenient. Also, beers are now served in 8, 11.5 and 14 oz glasses of your choice, unless it is a strong ale.

I was in the Gammon Coach House the first day it opened.  They offer craft beer &amp; comfort food.  I go to a bar for craft beer on tap.  I have plenty of bottles at home (many I have brewed myself). 

This place is a circa 1886 building behind a large Victorian mansion at the corner of Wilson and Batavia Ave.  Walking in, there is a vestibule to keep the winter cold out that pushes into the room.  The small 6-seat bar is 2 steps from the door. To the right is a nook of 2 bar height tables; to the left there are 3 bar height tables. The bar only seats 6.  There are 24 seats in this room and a back room that seats about 24.  GCH also has seating for 30 on a patio.  There is 1 TV for all to see  in the front room, and 1 in the back room.  There is sports on TV, no sound, with music playing (they put the Sox on at my request).  My favorite seat at any pub is at the corner or short side of the bar.  This place only has a straight bar, the short side has a garbage can and a stack of glasses and servers work from that end.  They could use a bigger bar, but space is limited.
 
The room has a lot of wood. The floor has a wood look, the north wall looks to be the original wood plank wall with single pane grid windows, The ceiling is wood plank.  It feels warm and cozy. The only problem is there is an opening to the kitchen with bright lights from the kitchen shining into this warm room, the cooks radio can be heard, and the cooks repeated yelling &#34;burger up&#34;.  They need a better method to notify food is ready, and doors to block off the kitchen&#39;s intrusion into the bar atmosphere. 

OK, Brad is the beer tender. He is very knowledgeable regarding craft beer and seems to be able to discuss any brewery in the country. I later learned he is a brew master.  They have 12 taps, but 2-4 are wasted on tasteless beers. They do have a very nice selection of brews in the remaining 8 taps.  Beers are sold in the standard 11.5 oz glass for around $4.80.  Now, the usual 14 oz glasses limit me to 2 beers to be legal to drive.  You could enjoy a variety 3 of these ales at a relaxed pace, and drive under the limit. They have a minimalist, but satisfying menu of build your own burger, build your own thin crust pizza, chill, wings and things.  I tried a burger and it was satisfying,  I ordered medium and it was medium, not bloody. Fries are good too. not too skinny, not to fat; slightly crispy on the outside with patatoey flavor inside. 

Over all, the place is great!  Great beer, good food ,knowledgeable beer tender, friendly crowd and it is only 4 blocks from my house."

They were delicious! And as always, the service was wonderful.

It&#39;s kind of hard to find... tucked behind an old Victorian home in downtown Batavia.  You&#39;ll definitely want to keep your favorite map app open if you haven&#39;t been here.  The place itself is small.  There&#39;s a small bar area with seating for about 20 people, then another room in back with room for another 30.  The place is super quaint and has really good, positive energy.  

The main attraction here is the beer.  They have 12 highly unusual taps running, stuff I have not seen since the Wheaton Ale Fest.  All super wonderful brews, and they serve small, medium, and large (a full pint) sizes of beer.  This is a cool option if you want to taste everything they are featuring.  They also had a really impressive list of bottled beer, stuff you don&#39;t see every day. The bartenders and waitstaff are super cool and love to talk about the choices.

Foodwise, the menu is pretty limited but what they have looked great.  I ended up having a hankering for grilled cheese.  I did mine with cheddar, tomato, and bacon.  Sure, it&#39;s a cholesterol bomb, but every once in a while it&#39;s fun to splurge.  After we ordered my GF was shocked I hadn&#39;t checked Yelp reviews yet.  Of course, when she dares me I&#39;m going to have to check.  Sure enough, some other Yelpers tipped that we should have gotten the sweet potato tots instead of the regular ones.  Next time, although for what it&#39;s worth the regular ones were awesome.

Overall, a super cool place.  I will definitely be coming back here for beer in the future."

Tap beers excellent &amp; accurately described.  Sandwiches meh.  No smoke to the brisket, cut too thick, and not as tender as it should have been.  Vegiburger less impressive than Burger King.

A short bike ride up a somewhat daunting hill later, we hit the Coach House, grabbed a seat in the outdoor patio, and ordered a Trim job, Wild Man, MoM, and a Mexican (guess you had to be there, the server had us laughing). Ordered a few appetizers - I&#39;d recommend the calzones, they were like pizza donuts. I love pizza donuts. Even after a hot day of bike riding.

My husband stumbled onto this place (thanks, Yelp), in an attempt to find a decent Friday fish fry (thank you, Lent).  He decided that we should give it a try solely based on 1.) finding it decently reviewed on Yelp and 2.) the photos of the food on their website.  I can&#39;t stress how small this place is, but then again, when you&#39;re called &#34;coach house,&#34; I guess you can&#39;t expect much bigger than a shoebox.  The atmosphere is quite charming, very pub-like.  There are a few tables in the front &amp; a small separate dining area in the back as well as a bar with a handful of barstools.  The beer menu is extensive, filled with interesting sounding craft beers, and the food menu is simple and straightforward.  I appreciate that.  The fish fry was excellent, and what&#39;s more, I was able to order tater tots instead of fries (oooooh yes).  For $11, I got 3 fat pieces of battered cod, and mound of tater tots, and a heap of pretty tasty cole slaw.  I&#39;m not a huge fan of slaw, especially when it&#39;s mayo-based, but this stuff was fresh and pretty tasty.  The service was a bit slow, but it was a Friday night, and there were only 2 servers.  I had to ask twice for a glass of water, but only once for a refill on the hot water for my Numi organic tea (yum).  Overall, my dining companion and I were quite satisfied with our experience at Gammon Coach House, so much so that we are already deciding when we&#39;ll come here again.

This is most certainly a great little gem, tucked away in downtown Batavia."

Parking -- there&#39;s plenty of room to park on either side of Wilson St. that runs alongside Gammon Coach House.

Lay-Out -- it&#39;s a little smaller inside, but not wall-to-wall people.  When it&#39;s warmer outside, you can also enjoy a pint on their patio.  There&#39;s a backroom with additional seating as well.  Some people are turned off by it not having a huge open floor plan, but that&#39;s how the building was made.  Back in the 90s, it used to be a sports card shop, so they&#39;ve done a pretty job opening it up as much as the building would allow them to.

Food -- I can only speak to the pizzas and once I had their fish.  The pizzas are good, with a crispy crust and the right amount of cheese.  The fish was good as well.

Beer -- the main reason I go is their selection of craft beers.  I&#39;m a huge fan of Three Floyds, Two Brothers, as well as some southern California IPAs such as Stone that they have.  Great stuff.

Service -- Service has been attentive and friendly in my visits there.  One server seemed a little frazzled on a busy night (perhaps they were shorthanded or something), but otherwise, I&#39;ve never had a problem.  They could do a better job wearing some sort of T-shirt or something to identify themselves.  Sometimes you can&#39;t tell if they&#39;re an employee or not.

Prices -- Are a little steep for Batavia, at least for the craft beers.  I can&#39;t recall prices on the food though.

Bathrooms -- were clean and functioning.  No graffiti, cracked mirrors or King Size Snickers bars in the toilets that management hadn&#39;t taken care of yet. Woo hoo!

TVs -- they have some by the bar, but this really isn&#39;t a sports bar.  If you&#39;re looking for something like Buffalo Wild Wings, you got the wrong place."

I am a huge craft beer fan and this place constantly surprises me with the amount of off-the-beaten-path selections that they have available.

Service is pretty good, typical enough for this type of venue. The servers are friendly and seem to know many of the regular patrons. It is a casual environment and a great place to bring a group. The pulled pork sandwich, the wings and the burgers are all very good. Pizzas are good too. 

Again, the highlight for the Coach House is definitely its consistently good craft beer list. So if you&#39;re looking for a great brew in the western suburbs, give this place a try."

Stopped in to see if the coach would turn into a pumpkin but midnight never came my friends.  Enjoyed a Ska Nut Brown Ale with a bowl of chicken tortilla soup so hearty you&#39;d a thought it was a stew.  Great flavor and a ton of crunchy strips made this my favorite tortilla......wait.for.it..........ever!

Oh my and the grilled cheese sammy on Texas toast with parmesan crust is a thing to behold.  It makes me wonder why anyone would make them any other way?"

-Quaint, comforting, relaxed atmosphere. 
-Great bartender (white collarded shirt, black vest, tiny glasses. I trust anyone dressed this way).
-Fantastic beer selection. Anyone who likes to branch out and try new brews will love GCH. They pride theirselves on their beer rotation, so you won&#39;t find the same beers very often. And you can order a sample size (probably about 8oz) for like $2. Can&#39;t beat that!
-Out of about 9 beers on tap, they only have one spout for Bud Lite.
-Tuesdays they have a hotdog wrapped in bacon and then deep fried.
-Tom (classy bartender) makes his Bloody Mary&#39;s with buffalo sauce and horseradish.

I&#39;ve been here a number of times since they first opened but always fairly late to meet up with friends for a beer or 2.  The draft list has been 90% different on each visit.  While I have had 80% of the beers previously that they had offered (I am a beer nerd), most I have never seen on tap.  While most would not be considered trending ultra-hot beer nerd brews, it is always a fantastic, well though out lineup of difficult to find beers.  Their bottle list I think could step up a notch in their offerings.  They could also benefit by offering a couple high-end large format beers on the menu (last visit they did have Goose Island Kind Edward and Bourbon County Coffee Stout which is a good step in the right direction).

My last visit I was there for dinner which was an interesting change of pace for seeing how they operate as a restaurant.  The place is pretty small and littered with vintage farmhouse tables and chairs which can be a tight fit but definitely cozy to sit at.  When the evening gets later and the drinking crowd comes out, these tables are quite a hindrance.  The scene during dinner was definitely all families dining with their adult &#34;children&#34;.

The food is comfort food and quite good.  The chips and salsa are homemade and were devoured instantly.  The grill cheese was more than your average offering with cheese that was also slapped to the outside and charred = delicious.  The patty melt was advertised to include grilled onions which werent delivered, it was non-the-less great.  I paired it with Greenbush&#39;s Retribution which is an offering you won&#39;t find elsewhere and a perfect match.

The odd: all beers are offered in 2 or 3 different sizes (with large being a pint glass) with prices like 4.35 and 5.15 which its nice to see them conscientious on their offering price, its a bit of a head scratcher in the bar world.

This is a place I will continue to frequent often."

Add to that, that it took us 2 spins around the block to find it and you have all the conditions of a hidden gem.

My wife and I headed here on a date night without our son so we could enjoy some adult time.  Really glad we did.  The extensive beer selection also rotates micro/custom brews and if you sign up for their text message service you&#39;ll get notification when new ones are coming in or when special brews are going to make their appearance.

We started with the mini-calzones appetizer and they were pretty good.  Only complaint was that the red sauce that comes with it was cold and could have been warmed a little.

I had a burger with pepper jack, bacon and a fried egg.  It was made to order (medium rare).  You get your choice of fries, tots or sweet potato tots.  Had never seen sweet tater tots before and they were fantastic!!

My wife had the longhorn grilled cheese which they use a Parmesan cheese coating on the outside.  She really liked it a lot and also had the sweet tater tots.

We left with full tummies and ready for the rest of the evening.  Yes, the knock on the Gammon Coach House might be their limited menu, difficult location and small size but as I&#39;ve said before in other reviews, if you can do a few things and do them excellently, that&#39;s a win versus doing a million things half-baked.

Our service was excellent by the way."

The biggest fault of the Gammon Coach House is the service. Its hit or miss, and has been mostly miss for me. Many times the server will dissapear for quite awhile while our beer glasses sit empty, or at one point after ordering our beer from our waitress, we saw it sitting on the end of the bar for at least 10 min. before it finally found its way to us. I don&#39;t think I can take any friends here since the service is embarrassing.

The food isn&#39;t bad - but I wish they would expand their menu. The grilled cheese has been quite good the number of times I&#39;ve tried it (and the order was correct). The pulled pork is nothing to write home about - but again I&#39;d like to see a bit more variety on the menu.

UPDATE 1-3-14: I&#39;ve visited Gammon a number of times since my initial review and things have gotten much better there. The beer selection has been wonderful each time, and I think the service has improved quite a bit as well. The food menu is fairly stagnant still - its mostly basic bar food, I&#39;d like some more non-greasy/fried items to go with such good beer. I&#39;ve given them 4 stars up from my initial 2."

This place was great the first time I went there.  Since then, it&#39;s going downhill.  First and foremost, I can&#39;t agree with their prices at all.  I understand craft beers are specialty for them, but that doesn&#39;t make it okay to gouge every single person on every single drink in the bar.  Furthermore, the service is getting worse.  When I first went this place was fairly new, but now it seems like they&#39;re getting comfortable and lax in their efforts.  But worst of all, I was there one night when a mentally challenged individual came in.  One of the tables started harassing and belittling the individual.  When another table attempted to defend the mentally challenged man, the staff asked that table to leave.  They asked the table defending the mentally challenged man to leave.  Why?  Because in the words of the staff member &#34;The other table tips better.&#34;

Unbelievable."

It is hard to distingush the staff because they wear street clothes. We recieved our salads with our entrees vs. before which I thought was odd, the waitress thought it was normal.  I had the meatloaf, it was really tender but covered in a really thick glob of brown gravy.  My husband has food allergies and had a hard time finding wheat free options on the menu.  Nobody asked us how our meal was, even when I asked for a doggie bag for 3/4 of my meal.  They really need to fix service issues and improve their menu."

That said, this was a fun, small local place that was worth the adventure of trying to find the place. Good beer and good food. Our server, Matt, was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.

I&#39;ve lived in the Pacific NW for quite some time and was exposed to some of the best craft beer in the country.  Now I&#39;m lucky enough to live in the Great Lakes region where we have equally as good craft brews just not quite as many options.  BUT thanks to The Gammon Coach House I can experience all my favorites and try some new ones without having to leave my hometown of Batavia.  It&#39;s true good to be true but yes...Batavia finally has a pub worth raving about.  GCH is a nice spot to enjoy high quality craft brew with a solid pub menu.  They just opened so I think they are still working out some kinks but overall they&#39;re on the right track.  I&#39;ve visited GCH about 5 times now and continue to enjoy the experience.  The food menu is a bit limited but the if you&#39;re in the mood for a quality burger or flat bread pizza then you&#39;ll be fine.  The burgers are better here than at the rival Geneva Ale House!  They also have sweet potato tater tots which are way better than their cousin the sweet potato fries.  They serve 10 beers on tap (sometimes they may be out of one or two of the hot sellers) and a host of bottles.  They could probably expand the bottle selection a bit but I prefer draft beer so I don&#39;t really mind.  They have two LCD TV&#39;s where you&#39;ll find a prime time football or baseball game on but watching sports isn&#39;t the main attraction here.  Save that for Buffalo Wild Wings.  Their patio is pretty big but with only a handful of nice days left in the year you better enjoy it while it lasts.  The service is pretty good but it&#39;s getting better.  The two girls behind the bar, Melmo and Nora, are great.  

The one think I&#39;d like to see is some drink options for kids.  Maybe some apple juice, lemonade, milk and a plastic cup option.  I&#39;m not suggesting they go over board with a full kids menu option or anything but it would be nice to have an alternative to glassware and the orange juice and water they serve to kids today.  I&#39;ll be watching to see if they change this up.  If they don&#39;t then I&#39;ll have to assume they&#39;re intentionally not catering to kids which would be sad because Batavia is a family oriented town.  I&#39;d hate to have to limit my business because I couldn&#39;t have my 6 year old join me for a burger and some tater tots!  

I really hope they continue with the quality beer and food selection I&#39;ve seen so far.  If they do then there&#39;s no doubt GCH will be a big success for Batavia and the surrounding Fox Valley area!"

We visited on a Friday night to try the fish. We sat outside on the cute little patio out front. So far so good. The menu is not extensive, but we were just there to try the fish, so it didn&#39;t really matter. I decided to try the baked cod instead of the traditional fried variety, as I was trying to be good. The waitress came by to take our drink orders and explained that did not have baked cod that night - instead there was a tilapia dish with mushroom polenta. Ok, no big deal. I decide to go with the fried fish. One of my companions tried to order a non-alcoholic beer, which they do not have. Oops. I asked for a kids menu for my four year old, and the waitress explained that they don&#39;t have one. She said most kids just order the pizza or hot dog from the regular menu. We decided on the macaroni and cheese for him (side order - $4). I hate paying for macaroni and cheese since it&#39;s so cheap to make at home, especially when doesn&#39;t come with anything else, but I digress...

The food came out fairly quickly, and everything was nice and hot. The fish itself was good, but the batter was super thick, and reminded us of a corn dog. The fries were good, but the coleslaw looked like it was made quite a while ago. It was starting to brown, and the carrots on top looked dry. I asked the waitress (very nicely) if there was any fresh coleslaw, and she told me it&#39;s a vinegar coleslaw and not a creamy one, and that it had been refrigerated (basically telling me I was wrong to think there was anything wrong with it). Um, ok. She said she could bring me another one, but at that point I just decided to skip it altogether. At the end of our meal, we all had piles of breading on our plates and no one had touched the coleslaw. 

One final experience that sort of capped off the evening. I believe there are apartments or offices of some sort above the restaurant. While we were sitting on the patio, someone came out of a door that opens right onto the patio with a bag of garbage. I&#39;m pretty sure they worked/lived there, and weren&#39;t a restaurant employee, but it&#39;s still kind of gross to have someone carry garbage through a restaurant. Even if it is outside. 

Perhaps it will do well as a bar, what with the beer selection, but we probably won&#39;t go back for a meal."

Pizza is legit and the truth. Any other pizza is weak and a joke. If you don&#39;t eat or don&#39;t like jets, you must suck at life all together.

Jets, FTW bitches."

I used them to cater a birthday party at DuPage Children&#39;s Museum.  They knocked it out of the park.

The driver showed up a couple minutes early.  Our party was downstairs by the cafeteria, which was quite a walk.  He was super friendly even though he had to make 3 trips(sorry!).  

The pizza was great as expected, everybody enjoyed it.  The item I was concerned about was the party sized chef salad.  But it was fresh and crunchy all the way through.  No nasty wilted lettuce or questionable toppings.  They also included a full bottle of Italian dressing, a full bottle of ranch dressing, plus a huge bag full of all sorts of crazy dressings(1000 island, Catalina and some fat free varieties).  On top of stocking us with dressing for the foreseeable future, they also gave us 4 free 2 liters &#34;for doing business with us.&#34;

They really gave me great service, freebie or not, I&#39;ll always go back."

The pan pizza is not typical Chicago but really good. I ordered a small and it is six pieces, plenty for dinner and a leftover meal (for one). I especially like that it&#39;s a rectangle because the corners are awesome! Also ordered the Jet&#39;s Bread which was great and could be a meal itself. Best of all was the price - absolutely got my money&#39;s worth. I will be ordering again!"

We ordered a large deep dish pizza with Jet&#39;s Turbo Crust and it was amazing!! The veggies were fresh and not soggy. I really have nothing bad to say about Jets. The delivery guys are nice too, and the one time I had to call the store, the staff was very friendly! Even their bread sticks are great! We have definitely found our new pizza place!"

The Eight Corner Deep Dish is the pizza you MUST get. Be sure to add the Turbo crust (free -- garlic + butter + parmesan; they also have other options like Cajun and Poppyseed). 

This Deep Dish is two little square pizzas, and if you are a crust monster this is the one for you! I want to write love sonnets to it. I don&#39;t understand how in the 10-12 minutes it takes from me placing my order to the pizza being ready that the crust gets so beautifully brown, almost caramelized around the bottom edges.
 
Unlike the Hand Tossed [which we ordered by mistake once, and was okay], the Deep Dish doesn&#39;t really have a top edge; it&#39;s all about that glorious crunchy bottom crust. 

Also, this is different from Chicago style Deep Dish (which makes me very happy, as I don&#39;t like the concept of having sloppy sauce on the top of my pizza with nothing securing it to everything else). The closest analogs are Buddy&#39;s and Shield&#39;s from Detroit.

Regarding this particular location, we were served by a very polite young lady, and the pizza was made quickly, though we dropped in and ordered at the counter. 

In case you couldn&#39;t tell, I heartily approve of this place. I will have to resist the temptation to order every night. When you need your pizza fix, zoom up Ogden and try Jet&#39;s, because it&#39;s hip to be square."

Total was $16.80, and it was disappointing compared to the Route 59 location.  Pizza was salty, and on dried out side, particularly the mushrooms.

I really miss Detroit style pizza. Seeing locations in the Chicago area was like &#34;yeeessss&#34;, until I tried to order some. The online ordering system is an awful joke and beyond frustrating cause it doesn&#39;t work for our condo location. And calling was very much the same experience. I tried to order a year ago and had the same problems. They couldn&#39;t complete an order with ingredients on only half.  Who ever is in charge of this company should take their head out of the sand to see what&#39;s happening on a local level, maybe even set standards for staff hiring/training/ordering software/and website improvements before expanding any further. I literally ordered a pizza on an app, from a competitor in less time than it took to wright this. I still like the Jets from back home, sadly this is not the same."

So to say the least, I was excited when I found out you could order flavored crusts. Super awesome.  How I would describe this pizza? Well, it would have tasted a lot better if I had a killer hangover because this baby was ultra greasy. We&#39;re talking &#39;need multiple napkins while eating&#39; greasy. Since I was not nursing a bad hangover, and thus didn&#39;t need that amount of grease, the pizza was a little over-the-top for me. Flavor wise, it was a decent pizza, no complaints there. I can certainly see why people would love the Eight Corner Deep Dish; the crust, aside from the grease, is crispy and golden brown. 

That being said, this is now my go-to pizza option for those lazy, got wayyyy too drunk last night, need grease NOW food! Besides, when you&#39;re totally hung from overdoing the hooch, who even cares how you look when you&#39;re eating?"

I only order the 8 corner pizza with the Turbo Crust. It is INCREDIBLE.  

One time, I ordered and they forgot my diet coke, I said &#34;no worries&#34; and asked them to just deduct it from my bill (I paid via credit card) and the guy was apologizing profusely and went back to the store and brought me my diet coke!!!!!  Talk about service!!! :) 

It&#39;s amazing. Order it! 

I only gave it 4 stars because I wish they had other things to order from there- but that has NOTHING to do with their quality. :)"

I&#39;m not sure why other places can&#39;t make pan pizza taste like this, but if they did I&#39;d be a fan for sure.  Something about this pie- it&#39;s still crispy on the bottom and the crust has a nice consistency that the sauce and cheese work great with.  I also really appreciate how much these guys do for our school.  Definitely worth a try if you get burned out on the thin crust and deep dish that is prevalent everywhere in the Naperville area."

It was ABSOLUTELY amazing, and they didn&#39;t like when they said everything was organic and freshly made (they even said they don&#39;t have a microwave in the back!) 
This place used the be a food truck before it became a restaurant, and frankly I am glad it wasn&#39;t a truck that I had to find and I know exactly where it will be the next time that I want to eat here. 

The inside of the restaurant is cute! Nice and trendy. I came here for a quick lunch and the service was great, and quick. I really want to come back with a group of friends to eat and have some beer. I noticed there was a selection of craft beer there that I want to try! 

The gringo was a fried taco and it was super flavorful, and the aioli sauce on the shrimp taco and the veggie taco was fresh and flavorful. One thing that I liked about this place was the menu, each taco is sold individually (like a food truck) so you have the option of eating just one, or FIVE depending on how hungry you are, and you have the ability to mix and match."

I know this isn&#39;t really Mexican, but tacos! And it&#39;s something that we haven&#39;t really done, so we were off on an adventure!

We asked our server which tacos were the least spicy. We have issues and prefer to go mild to no spice. We opted for the Rail which gives you 3 each of 4 types of tacos. Here&#39;s what we got...

- BBQ Pork Tacos with a flour tortilla, pulled pork, bbq, onion, cabbage, and lemon aioli. This one was spicier than we were told. It was difficult to eat, that&#39;s for sure! Since I can&#39;t medically have spicy stuff, I left them for the boy.

- Classic Cheeseburger Tacos  with a flour tortilla, ground sirloin, colby cheese, lettuce, tomato, and mayo. I was pretty disappointed with this one. It really didn&#39;t have any seasoning. I would think that the meat would have been seasoned or something, but it was pretty bland. Maybe we got what we asked for?

- Chicken Tacos with a flour tortilla, chicken, onion, mixed greens, tomato salsa, and sour cream. This was a pretty good taco. I got it without salsa and the chicken was nicely seasoned for the whole taco to handle! This was a fav all around.

- ChopHouse Tacos with a flour tortilla, sirloin steak, portabellas, onion, cabbage, baby swiss, and house steak sauce. My dad and I loved this one since we&#39;re the mushroom lovers! The meat and schrooms were nicely cooked and it had a great beefy flavor.

We were also given Rice and Beans. Not your typical rice and beans. They were pretty good.

We ordered Quinoa Salad and Parmesan Herb Chips &amp; Salsa as our starters. The salad was really good! The homemade chips were great!"

Others at my table ordered tacos with shrimp as well as the remoulade. I tried another taco which was okay for me.  My hunny had the truck ir in other words burrito. It was very huge and tasty. 

I loved the indoor and outdoor set up here. Our server was cool. Their lemonade is also home made and it made everything just right.

I mentioned this to the dude (one of the cooks, I think?) who brought us our tacos and he was in complete agreement and said he needed to give that a try. I hope that someday that makes it onto the menu because DAMN that would be good. Those are totally my two favorite tacos here and you know what they say about two great tastes that taste great together...no, wait, that was peanut butter and chocolate or something muddled in my 80s-brain. 

Here&#39;s what&#39;s great about the new Wheaton Fire It Up location. I mean, in addition to the already awesome food. There&#39;s more space than the Naperville location so you don&#39;t have as long of a wait. 

Last night, my wife and I stopped by for some pre-Thanksgiving Taco Tuesday grubbin&#39; and left full and happy after indulging in a couple of cocktails, the parmesan chips and guac, and a round of tacos. 

Our waiter was super friendly, and tho I don&#39;t often use the phrase &#34;chill&#34; he was super chill. We had a slight speed bump in the fact that our chips were stale when they arrived. We were so hungry that we ate almost all of them anyway before I had a chance to mention they were stale, but when I did he brought us an entire fresh order complete with more guac. After that, you know we were feelin&#39; guacy. (I need you guys to embrace that as a phrase. K thnx). 

The tacos were just as awesome as Naperthrill, and we stuffed ourselves on shrimp, pork, cheeseburger and gringo. All delicious. All prepared fresh and done extremely well. 

I&#39;m not sure if we&#39;ll return to this location based on distance from our house, but the size of the place definitely has something going for it and it&#39;s absolutely just as great as their other location. I hope FIU continues expanding and perhaps will open a location in my backyard someday.

No wait...that might be bad."

I had been to the Naperville location a few years back and didn&#39;t really find it that great, so I was hoping a different location might be a better experience. 

Had a seat at the bar and the server was great. I couldn&#39;t decide on what to order so I went with my servers suggestion and enjoyed my order.  

The Chophouse taco (steak, Portobello, onion, cabbage and the house spicy sauce) and the Shrimp taco (shrimp, cabbage, lemon aioli).  Both were very flavorful, using fresh ingredients and cooked well.  I loved the bit of spice in the Chophouse and added a bit more with the sauces provided. 

I wish there was more of a craft beer/cocktail menu, but I liked that the craft beer they did have were from local breweries."

A fresh Margarita sure hit the spot today on the patio. You&#39;ll be pleased they have a full bar here anx the patio is the perfect setting to enjoy tacos. During the week the lunch special is a great value, but don&#39;t forget Sangria Saturday&#39;s.

The hostess greeted us and took us to our table, and on the approach a very rude server runs up and yells at the host &#34;You&#39;re not putting them there! Put them somewhere else!&#34; And the poor stunned hostess didn&#39;t know what to do. She asked the server &#34;Well where should I put them?&#34; To which the unpleasant server replied &#34;I don&#39;t care but not here&#34;

So I get it. There&#39;s an eleven top waiting for space, but don&#39;t scream at the hostess in front of the guest. Later when that eleven top got sat they didn&#39;t even end up at that table. So clearly the hostess had things in hand. The server was more concerned with getting the eleven top. 

So we get sat outside. Not my preference, but the flustered host was trying to recover. 

Then we sit. And sit. And sit some more. Finally the server comes over. Asks if this is our first time at FIU. WE SAY NO. He proceeds to explain the concept. Okay. Whatever. 

Next he asks if we want to put in a drink order. I ask what beers are on tap. He says to me &#34;We only have local beers and you probably don&#39;t know what they are...&#34;

Excuse me? I can tell you all the local brewers, their regular beers and seasonal beers. Now the server doesn&#39;t know this, but I&#39;m pissed. 

So I ask well what do you have. He begins rattling off styles of beer &#34;I&#39;ve got two IPAs, a double bock, an American IPA, and a Farmhouse Pale Ale&#34;

Well first off it&#39;s a doppelbock. And not all IPAs are the same. So I ask what breweries, and his response ... &#34;I don&#39;t know&#34;

So you believe I&#39;m too stupid to know the local beers, and then can&#39;t be bothered to tell me the breweries? Fine. I&#39;ll have the Farmhouse because right now Solemn Oath has Hexafoos, and my guess is that&#39;s what you meant when you said Farmhouse Pale Ale. I hope I&#39;m not too stupid to figure that out. 

Food comes and it tastes bland. Like I said I&#39;m used to Aurora. I know what the food tastes like. This isn&#39;t it. 

We eat, and wait forever for the server to come back to get the check. The check shows an IPA. 

Okay. I give up. I&#39;m too stupid to know the local beers, but you&#39;re too stupid to enter the right beer? Without a doubt I had a Hexafoos.

I won&#39;t be going back because of the insulting, arrogant, incompetent staff and the underwhelming food. 

I also will not be going to Naperville anymore. See my other review as to why I won&#39;t be going there. This place should change their name to FuckItUp Tacos. They had a good thing going, but now it&#39;s apparently time to watch success burn for the sheer fun of it. Hope the fire keeps you warm!"

The quality of the food has been consistently great, and the service always feels personal - not creepy personal, quite the opposite - it feels friendly and organic rather than sterile or cheesy.

I haven&#39;t had anything there that I haven&#39;t liked, and I&#39;ve eaten three-quarters of the items on the menu - not all at one time of course.

I&#39;ll keep coming back! Careful with the hot sauce.

The margaritas were very good and fresh. The chips and guacamole were delicious as well. The guacamole was extremely fresh. 

We ordered the Rail, it comes with 4 different types of tacos with three of each. We ordered the chophouse, shrimp, bbq pork, and the steak. Each taco was served on a flour tortilla and came with coleslaw on it. 

The chophouse was actually our least favorite. It had a spicy sauce on it and mushrooms. But compared to the others it was just not as good. 

The shrimp was our favorite. The shrimp were extremely fresh and had a great flavor.

The bbq pork was also amazing. The pork was juicy and full of flavor and the combination with the coleslaw and flour tortilla worked well.

The steak taco was good as well. More along the lines of a classic steak taco. Good flavor and the steak was juicy.

Overall the food was alright. I would definitely go back to enjoy a margarita on the outside patio."

When I first saw the menu, I was excited about having pablano  gauc -I&#39;m a vegetarian, so avocados and pablanos are two of my absolutely favorite things. I then read some reviews, and I saw a few people say how the menu was too simple, or rather, every taco tasted the same, with a big dependency on the alioi. I&#39;ve make alioi myself and have always enjoyed it, so I thought it might be a fun adventure. I also read about the Parmesan chips, and how they tasted stale. Again, I was up for trying something new.

When we arrived, at 5:30 on a Friday, the place was filled. The host was very nice and asked if we wanted to wait for a table or eat at the bar. We said we&#39;d wait at the bar for a table. The place had a nice vibe, the  bartender was very friendly. In all, it seemed nice.

We were told we&#39;d have to wait 45 minutes, and we only  had to wait 10. Again, nice.

Then we got our gauc and chips. I make guac at least once a week. Fresh gauc isn&#39;t watery, it has chunks in it. It isn&#39;t  a paste. This was...like store bought gauc. Making matters worse, it had a level of spice and heat to it, but it didn&#39;t taste anything like a pablano.  Hubby immediately said, your guac is a million times better. It needed pablano flavor and salt..and actual avocado.  The chips?  What are they thinking. They are soggy and stale tasting. Seriously. Not our thing at all.

We then got our tacos. They looked good. I had a pablano and a veggie. Hubby had a poor boy and a gringo. We also split a beans and rice. The beans and rice were the only truly interesting part of dinner and they were oily. It was basmati rice with a lot of cumin and beans. It  reminded hubby of a curry of sorts.  The tacos? Both of mine tasted the same. They were the same, save for the one having cabbage and the other having mushrooms.  Hubby kind of enjoyed his gringo, but he couldn&#39;t eat his poor boy.  he said we make better tacos at home (lamb carnitas  being a favorite of his).

We finally decided that it was nice to try something new, but we wished we went to  Bien Truche or its sister restaurant.  Way better, and way more innovative and delicious. 

We will not be going back. When we want to just pick up tacos, we will go to Los Burritos.

This place might be a good taco truck, but a restaurant charging a reasonable amount of money? Skip it and head to Geneva or Glen Ellyn."

One of the partners waited on his and he was so enthusiastic to tell us about how the place came to be.  

They have a lunch special of two tacos and one side for $8 which is a screaming deal for organic, local, fresh and clean food.  They don&#39;t have a soda fountain.  They make their own lemonade, iced tea and their margarita mix is made by hand.  Can&#39;t wait to bring my husband here for their huge selection of beers.  Remember they started out as a food truck outside a brewery.

Food is delicious!  Start with the parm chips and guac.  You can&#39;t go wrong with any of the tacos.  Shrimp poorboy and BBQ pork were delicious!  

When you re done with lunch, check-out the resale shop on the corner.  Fun place to browse and they had some unique offerings.

Both the Naperville and Wheaton locations are virtually identical, except that the Wheaton locale is a bit snazzier inside, is located steps away from Wheaton College, and has a bar at which you can sit while you eat your delicious tacos.

Highly recommended to those who are in love with tacos, hot sauce, and/or local beer. I mean seriously, how can you go wrong with that combination?"

We&#39;ve been a few times now and our favorite is the chophouse taco followed by the pork and shrimp. Really, though, we&#39;ve tried all tacos so far except the fried one and we love them all. Guac and chips are also good. Just wish you could get a few chips and some salsa for free or a half size of these starters, which are really too big for two people.

Service is good, but it would be nice if they automatically brought waters to the table. We&#39;ve had to ask each time. 

Go on Saturday for their special sangrias. Really good and nice in this hot weather."

We went to Fire It Up on Mothers Day and sat outside on the patio. Started with drinks and the margarita was so fresh! Pretty sweet, definitely hard to have more than one, but definitely worth a try. The chips and guac were amazing, there is something about those perfectly fried chips with parmesan that is so addicting! Tacos were speciality and very street taco style (which is my favorite).

The Naperville location is 5-star amazing and I was pumped to find a location closer to home. I ordered my usual order from the Naperville location: chips and guac, a gringo taco, a cheeseburger taco, and a BLT taco. The chips, the amazing incredible delicious Parmesan dusted chips I am OBSESSED with at the Naperville location, were... Off. They were so greasy that they weren&#39;t crunchy, but almost chewy. They were bendable. They were still parm dusted, but there was a ton of parm at the bottom of the dish, too. The guac was brownish at the edges of the container. The gringo taco was just so greasy it was almost inedible. Even the BLT taco was greasy from the single strip of bacon on it. 

Typically I would say this is my own fault for getting takeout, but I get takeout at the other location, further from my house, and it arrives perfect, consistently. I guess this is what i get for  choosing convenience over reliability. I may check this place out again if I&#39;m right in Wheaton, but otherwise, the schlep out to the edges of Naperville for perfect chips and fresh guac is well worth it."

They started as a food truck &amp; are now tucked in to Wheaton just off the main downtown area so they would be easy to miss if you are just wandering around downtown.  They have a sleek modern decor and the restaurant was spotless when we visited in the middle of a Saturday.  What else I loved:
-they locally source their ingredients and beers/spirits as much as possible (they have a listing of the farms/breweries on a chalkboard right when you walk in)
-nice variety of &#34;fusion&#34; tacos to choose from
-they make all their own sauces
-the tacos are sold individually so you can order as many or as few as you like and try a variety
-decent price point (tacos were generally $3.50 - $4.25 each &amp; margaritas were $8 each)
-they do not skimp on the amount of ingredients in your taco; served on a 6&#34; tortilla &amp; they fill it up without overfilling
-excellent friendly &amp; attentive service
-nice outdoor patio area if you want to dine or enjoy some cocktails in the fresh air
-bonus points awarded for at the bar seating they have some double hooks spaced out just under the countertop so ladies can hang their purses or you can hang your jacket when the weather is cooler. Thank you for this!!

The Hubs &amp; I shared 4 different tacos and they were all so delicious we couldn&#39;t pick a fave.  We had the Chophouse (think steakhouse dinner in a taco with perfectly seasoned steak, sauteed shrooms &amp; onions &amp; a special steak sauce), the BBQ Pork (so tender &amp; in addition to the BBQ sauce on the pork it has a lemon aioli which really complemented it nicely), the Shrimp (Yum w/a bunch of shrimp in that taco!), and the Gringo (more of your typical &#34;American&#34; style taco, ground beef, beans, cheese, lettuce, tomato in a fried taco shell which wasn&#39;t greasy and fried just the right amount to be crispy but still hold together when you eat it).  This will definitely be one of our go-to places to have a nosh as we frequently find ourselves in/near Wheaton."

As an appetizer started off with the Cuban rolls. These are spicy...So if you don&#39;t like spicy these aren&#39;t for you.  If you like spice..you won&#39;t regret it! 

For tacos.. Gringo taco is the best! It truly melts in your mouth!

Lastly.. Parmesan chips r amazing!

I&#39;ve been to this new location twice and it&#39;s completely consistent in quality and FLAVORS. Flavors are in all caps because they are that good. My go-to favorites are the Big Truck and the BBQ pork tacos, but guess what? Everything is ridiculously good. The hot sauce is incredible. The staff is friendly and the place looks real nice.

What&#39;s great about this specific location is the new space - it has a really cute enclosed outdoor patio. It&#39;s practically snowing now, but I can easily see myself drinking margaritas in the sunshine before taking a train home (College Ave train station is steps away).

I ordered the shrimp quinoa salad and that rocked! It had a blend of flavors i would not have known to put together and it was amazing. So good i actually thought about going back today (the day after eating there). 
We also ordered the brownie chimichanga bites which were the perfect size for each person to end the evening with a last bite of yumminess. Just so good.

Quick and friendly service, tasty food - sounds good to me. 

I&#39;m sure some could think it&#39;s a tad pricey for individual tacos ($3.50-$4.25) that aren&#39;t huge, but I do like that it&#39;s locally sourced and organic, so I get it. Taco Tuesday helps with the price a bit though. 

Between our group we tried just about every taco. BBQ pork was definitely a hit. Shrimp Po&#39; Boy had a nice kick.

Now for the food, it&#39;s our go-to taco spot. We really like the guac and chips, appreciate the local beer selection and use of organic ingredients, and LOVE the tacos (get them with corn tortillas). My personal favorite is the Cheeseburger Taco. Sweet jeebus, it tastes so crisp and the mayo compliments the meat and cheese so well! Also, their special salsa will always be part of my meal as I cant help but squeeze that ish&#39; all over my tacos and chips.

Fire It Up in Wheaton does not disappoint! The decor and ambiance is the same if not improved - it&#39;s a beautiful location, and Julie and Rick did a fantastic job of decorating the new spot to match it&#39;s Naperville locale.

The tacos are WAY overdressed with with greens.  There is literally a mini-salad on each one.  This isn&#39;t necessarily a terrible thing, and I get it - it&#39;s a cheap and healthy way to add bulk and make it look like you&#39;re getting a lot of bang for your buck.  But there&#39;s really no variation from taco to taco.  The same mixed greens - everywhere, in abundant qualities.  This makes it difficult to savor the really high quality, locally sourced meats that they&#39;re using.  The steak they used was tender and well-seasoned, but it was hard to realize that with a mouth full of lettuce.

We tried six different tacos, and overall they were pretty decent.  The least successful were the shrimp (overcooked and rubbery), the veggie (mostly just rice with a hearty helping of the aforementioned greens; not very exciting) and the BBQ pork (sauce was a little too sweet and there was a little too much of it).  The steak was great, though - and the sauce on the southwest chicken was amazing.  

Chips were good, salsa was good.... sangria was delicious and the margaritas are strong.

As far as service goes - our waitress was attentive but not obnoxiously so.  The stool seating is not very comfortable, but since this isn&#39;t really a place that you&#39;re going to linger for a long time, I guess that&#39;s okay.  It would be nice if there were hooks for coats or purses, though.

Patio looks fun, so I&#39;ll probably be back when it warms up!"

I&#39;m a regular of their Naperville location and I&#39;ve never been disappointed, I was in the area and thought I&#39;d stop in this one to see what it was like. It&#39;s obviously bigger than the Naperville location, but not overwhelming. With ample outdoor seating which will be nice when that season comes! I ordered the gringo, cheeseburger and BLT tacos the gringo and cheeseburger I get every time because they are amazing but my third I like to switch up. Everything tasted freaking great! My boyfriend always gets the truck with the hot sauce and just raves about that too. My one and only complaint here is they make super weak margaritas and taste like I&#39;m just drinking the syrup. Not good, and at 8 bucks a pop I expect more, think about it, if you make them decent, meaning I can actually taste the tequila then I will most definitely order another one. But I left drink only about half. Don&#39;t come here for those unless they decided to be better at it. I decided to not let that effect my 5 star rating because it&#39;s not like I went there for the booze. So just a heads up on that, hit up a bar after for booze.

I came here last week with a few people &amp; we were very, very disappointed in this place.
I live nearby so I&#39;ve been wanting to check it out for awhile. We came around 7pm on a Wednesday &amp; weren&#39;t greeted promptly. When we were greeted, about 5 minutes later..we were told it would be a half hour wait even though there were open tables &amp; no one else waiting. After about 15 minutes I asked if we could at least sit down &amp; order drinks. The hostess then informs us the reason she didn&#39;t seat us is because &#34;the kitchen is backed up&#34;. OK...but can we sit down?! (we won&#39;t order food for awhile if the chefs need a little more time)...... She then seats us.

We order a few drinks, some sangria &amp; a couple on-tap beers. (nothing wrong here, the drinks were good).
Then, about 15 mins later we each order about 3 tacos each. Which, as I&#39;d like to mention..none of them really appealed to us. It seems all of the tacos on the menu have mayo..or aioli or some other sauce they are drenched in. I understand this is a &#39;fusion&#39; restaurant but the menu lacks restraint. That&#39;s already a red flag.

Fast forward 50 minutes...YES 50... We finally get our tacos.

I can handle a long wait on food if it&#39;s worth it but these tacos...were AWFUL. The flour tortilla&#39;s they serve are not homemade &amp; pretty bad quality to start. They really skimp on the actual meats- and add a lot of fillers like lettuce &amp; sauces. I could make better tacos at home. 

If you go to this place...walk right back out and head down the street to &#39;a toda madre&#39; where your money will be well spent.  Won&#39;t be returning here unless it&#39;s solely for drinks."

I have a hard time figuring out if the chips were stale or if the oil wasn&#39;t hot enough and made the chips an oily, soft mess. You shouldn&#39;t be able to bend chips without breaking them. Thank goodness I had a margarita to wash the taste away. Wait a second......where&#39;s the salt on my glass? There it is! It&#39;s on a slice of lime floating in the glass. How unusual! How unique! How dumb! There&#39;s a reason why restaurants don&#39;t put the salt on a lime floating in the glass. It&#39;s because the salt is meant to be tasted with each sip without having to shove your fingers into the glass to pick up the lime and lick it.  

The tacos are actually decent, but not outstanding. The Cheeseburger taco is an actual cheeseburger in a flour tortilla. The Gringo has a (very) deep fried flour tortilla and it&#39;s pretty good. 

Summary: If you&#39;re a foodie expecting something like Big Star, stay away. If you&#39;re a person with more simple tastes, give it a try. If the chips weren&#39;t so awful I&#39;d rate this place a 3.5."

The Parmesan chips were really good and I ordered the chicken taco and the bbq port taco. The chicken taco is very mild but flavorful, while the bbq pork has a lot of flavor, not the hot kind, just the good kind. Very impressed with the food integrity and local sourcing.

The service was great and tacos were good. 

This is a quaint little place that locally sources, including their beer. I ordered the following:

Half Acre Pony Pilsner - this was a nice local beer, lighter, yummy.

Chips and Guac - the Guac was fresh and tasty. The chips were Parmesan dusted. They were ok, kind of bland. 

2 tacos- Taco Tuesday! I order one with Bbq pork. Good flavor, sweet &amp; crispy from the cabbage. The second, steak &amp; mushroom with a little bite. Both had a nice mix of taste and texture, filling.

Lastly, the music was spot on with my taste. Started with 311 (love them!), Incubus, Weezer, the Gorillaz, Beck, RHCP, etc. good music is always a win for me. 

Try them out! Worth it!"

We had an appetizer of parmesan chips and guacamole - very average and chips were not warm and had very little flavor. 
It took nearly 45 min to get our burrito and 2 tacos... the tortillas were cool to touch. Hard to believe they have/had food trucks with turn-around times like that.

I came in with my wife and two small children and it is very frustrating to see the same size group sit down at the same time as us and they get drinks and appetizers before we even got our drinks. 

That being said, these are quite possibly the best tacos I&#39;ve ever had. Not traditional, that&#39;s for sure but everything is pumped so full of flavor. They marinate everything and every taco has their own special sauce. I realized halfway through my three tacos that I haven&#39;t even been putting the awesome homemade hot sauce on them!

They also have a great beer selection ND the chimichanga desert is to die for.

Definitely recommend checking this place out."

Chips and fresh chunky guac almost had me filled up before dinner came.  I actually had the &#39;truck&#39; burrito which had a little bit of everything in it and was a different bite every time.

Chips &amp; guacamole grew on me.  Would have liked the chips to not be chewy...wish they were fresh and hot.
Had a Gringo taco which I really enjoyed, and a shrimp taco, which was pretty good.  Rice &amp; beans was interesting....just ok.  Margarita was average.  
 I will likely go back to try other things on the menu.

The ambiance is wonderful, especially the surprising outdoor seating area which is not expected when viewd from the entrance; in fact the venue appeared &#39;closed&#39; when our family pulled up. 
It was a warm late August Saturday evening and we had our choice of &#39;in or out&#39;. The inside appears clean and inviting and with a nice atmosphere but we chose &#39;out&#39; and it reminded us of some of our old Lincoln Park haunts; A very inviting patio. The kids liked it too. (Be warned to bring mosquito spray though). 
The service was prompt and friendly, they explained the &#39;origin story&#39; and their food quality. Waitperson recommended items and alerted us to the portion size.
We did the chips and guacamole; I also asked for salsa as well. The chips were OK...1/2 were crispy and  1/2 were chewy...not sure which it was supposed to be! I like em crispy. 
The guac was great.
The salsa was so so though my wife liked it. To me it tasted sort of relishy and was a paste like consistency.
My son got the pulled pork taco and enjoyed it. My wife got the steak and Portobello mushroom tacos and like them. I ordered &#39;The Truck&#39;; their burrito w/ steak, chicken and shrimp. The waitperson recommended I get the shrimp on the side after I mentioned that did not sound like a good combo.
I did. The burrito was a solid &#39;good&#39;.  My wife had the lemonade (really good) and I had the margarita...so so again because the taste was a little sweet and the salt was &#39;on the lime&#39;. I had not realized what &#39;salt on the lime&#39; meant, it meant they placed the salt on the lime in your drink...duh)
It may be picky but I think salt &#39;on the rim&#39; is a standard that makes it easier for those of us who like salt margaritas to actually make it easier to taste a little salt w/ each sip instead of pulling out a lime to lick it!  At $8 it as just OK. 
All in all it was a pleasant experience but it lacked something important: It did not seem to me to taste like the expected Mexican fair; more new age Wheaton Mexican. I appreciate organic/locally sourced/etc. but want some Mexican tastiness too.
Another gripe: Paying 5-7 bucks for chips and salsa/guac is a deal breaker for me. 99.999% of Mexican restaurants provide immediate gratis chips and salsa to their customers. A table of 4 goes through them like crazy and at that price there should have at least been a refill or two of the chips to make it worthwhile.
Sooo; while I can see that they run a good establishment I would not return due to my reservations stated above though I encourage anyone to give it a try...my wife and kids like their fair...I thought it was OK. Obviously others seem to like that taste of this version of &#39;Mexican&#39; cooking."

Sweet! The tacos are ordered individually, so you can get a nice array of whatever your heart desires. I love getting the portabella and the veggie tacos.

We went on a pretty cold winter&#39;s evening and it was almost as cold inside as it was outside. Most of the diners were wearing their coats. They have a big old fireplace that was not working. I asked our server about this and he said they tried to light it a week before and it was blowing smoke into the room. Don&#39;t you think they might try and get it working in a week?
I&#39;m not used to not getting complimentary chips and salsa in a Mexican restaurant, but that was okay. The chips and guac we ordered were interesting. The tacos were tasty and the waiter was very nice. The biggest problem, it is hard to enjoy a dinner when you are freezing!

I ordered the shrimp taco and the gringo. The gringo was literally dripping from being so soggy.  For two lunch specials, a margarita, a soft drink and a guacamole appetizer, we paid $50.

We moved to another table further away from the music. When our waiter, William, came with our drinks, he mentioned that we had moved so we told him why. He replied &#34; We&#39;re a rockin place. My mother likes it.&#34; He then walks away without taking our orders. Two noisy freight trains had passed (the restaurant backs up to the train station) before he ambled over to take our order. The food was just ok. My husband had asked for corn tortillas but got flour. I wanted to ask for lemons for my fresh lemonade because it had little flavor, but William was nowhere in sight. When we were finished and ready to leave he came and offered more lemonade and we asked for the check instead. When we had the check and looked at the total we handed him our charge card. He went off printed customer and restaurant tabs, gave them to us and left. My daughter noticed that the top receipt didn&#39;t match the total on the other receipts. William didn&#39;t appear again (there were only 3 tables outside and 1 inside that were occupied). We went in to the bar and asked who was in charge and the gentleman there said that he was. He assured us that it wasn&#39;t a scam and recharged us the correct amount for our meal, while supposedly deleting the incorrect charge. 3 days later I have been charged the correct bill total but still have the incorrect charge as a hold on my credit card. I told the friend who had recommended Fire it Up to us and was told that a very similar problem had occurred there with his son and date. I resent that I have a hold on my account and that I have to spend time monitoring the situation until it is taken care of properly. I would recommend that everyone checks their receipts carefully especially if you are charging your meals!"

One thing that really stood out for me was the amazing calamari appetizer. Best I have had in many years; large portion, fresh, fried to perfection and a tasty red sauce. 
Overall, the mains were above average with the exception of the pizza. The pizza was on special for $5, and that is what we got,, an uninspired flop of dough, undercooked... Reminded me of Little Ceasar&#39;s. Stay away from the pizza!
The Linguine al Fagottaro was very good. My daughter is a vegetarian. Excellent veg choice. I had the left overs the next day.. yummy!
My son had the  Rigatoni alla Paesana.. very good as well. The sausage was really good. 
I was going lite and had the Ceasar Salad which was very fresh and tasty. I also had the Cream of Crab soup.. which was okay, but had very little crab meat if any... 
Overall, the service was above average. Our wait person was very busy with some large tables, but the bus staff picked up the slack. When we sat down, they brought hot bread. I could have made a meal of that, olive oil and shredded parmesan cheese provided.  Super yummy! Drinks were refilled and plates picked up in a timely manner as the courses progressed. 
We all had dessert. The termisso was very good. Me and my son shared the Sloppy Sundae.. which was large and very good. 

Overall... with the exception of the below average pizza, could have given 5 stars. Recommend."

This time we both ordered a filet at MW and was overcooked. At one point I questioned if it was a filet or a skirt steak they served us because of how tough and stringy it was. I gave them one star because I was hungry, 2nd for the good waitress (not her fault), the sauce and potaotes served with it were pretty good. It probably would have been really good had they used quality meat and cooked it right. Too bad. :(

However, I was a bit unhappy that we didn&#39;t get to stay in the party room which I didn&#39;t really understand the reason. I made a reservation for the party room for 10 of us a week ago. A lady took my reservation and happily told me I was all set and there is no minimal expense required.

4 hours before my reservation time, I got a call from the restaurant and asked me to call back to confirm my reservation which I did right away. I called back and was told Party room is not available and we are moved to a separate area which I thought it is a separate room. I told him we have 10 ladies who could be very loud when we are excited to see each other. He said no worries. 

A couple of my girlfriends got there before me.  We were moved to a big table next to a few small tables. After we sat down, they told me they heard from the host that we were booted from the party room because we didn&#39;t pay the minimal deposit for the party room. I would be happy to pay the fee if there was someone told me when I called. I felt like someone lied to me. It is OK to ask us to move to a table if there is someone really needed the party room. I&#39;d understand. But if you told me there is NO minimum expense needed when I make the reservation, you&#39;d better to stick to your word. Not give the party room out to someone who made the reservation after me. This is not right.

I didn&#39;t want to ruin the night for the girls who have not seen each other for a few months. We still chatted and enjoyed dinner. Both Tilapia and Halibut fish were delicious. Pastas were a little bit off. Our server was awesome. For desert, we tried Tiramisu, Creme Brulee,  German Chocolate cake for dessert. Tiramisu was right on the spot. Other two are just OK.  

I&#39;m not sure if I will come back here. Decided to write to the restaurant to see how they respond."

PROS:
The atmosphere was warm and inviting. The pinot noir (me) and old fashioned (the hubbs) were delicious. Our waitress was spot-on. The sausage risotto was addicting - I wanted more! She said we could add a protein to it and have as an entree. I will definitely do that next time instead. The hubbs said the gnocchi was heavy but very delicious. The sauce was tasty like Alfredo. I wish restaurants paired heavy meals with small salads to change the palate in between bites. 

CONS: 
My chicken with zucchini was annoyingly salty. Four stars for this reason. I could not eat the veggies, and I&#39;m a veggie fanatic. The goat cheese is the only thing that helped me finish the chicken. I think the price did not reflect the quality and presentation of the food. My chicken with zucchini cost $19, but it looked and tasted like a $15 dinner. 

Also, the bathrooms were dirty. As a general former manager myself, I analyze all bathrooms, as I feel they are a direct relationship as to how much detail the management focuses on the establishment. After an hour, the tiny garbage cans were still overflowing with paper on the floor. It is not a patron&#39;s job to remind staff to do theirs. Just sayin&#39;."

First it&#39;s a pretty large place so getting a table is not so difficult.  Also they have seating at the upper level bar area that&#39;s first come first serve so firebricks four or smaller that&#39;s a good spot....p&amp;l s you can watch TV while eating. 

While menu is not the largest they do have offerings in all the categories which is nice as well as daily specials. 

Some of my favorite dishes:

Mussels in spicy red sauce 
Cucumber and pea pod salad

Chicken dishes are very good as are the typical pasta dishes.

This night I enjoyed homemade fettuccine noodles with lobster and tomatoes and olive oil.  The dish was one of my favorite with real lobster claw meat and not the processed stuff!!!

Service is always very good and the price is reasonable. 

Great place for a very good meal.

We had a very nice waitress here who helped my mom and I navigate the menu on our first visit. I have to take away points for the lack of items on the menu. For such a large restaurant with a good reputation, there wasn&#39;t much to choose from to eat! My mom special ordered a custom penne and I got a burger. (At an Italian place? Yes, I&#39;m that person.) The food was great! Hot, tasty, definitely homemade. 

I would recommend this place for a nice dinner out. The prices are not lunch friendly. Their lunch deals are $16 per person, and while they include a sizeable amount of food, it&#39;s too costly for lunch. I won&#39;t be back (Italian is not my thing) but my mom sure will!"

The restaurant gets big bonus stars for having a very large and nicely presented gluten-free menu. And they had that holy grail of items: the gluten-free pizza!  
BUT...
I ordered one with sausage, artichoke, eggplant, and black olives.  As shown in the pictures below, upon arrival there was very little in the way of sausage toppings. As a matter of fact, there were only seven pieces of sausage for the eight slices of pizza!  One slice would have to be naked.

Also, it really wasn&#39;t very warm.  I described it as the temperature of a cracker that had sat in a beam of sunshine.

However, as any good user of yelp knows, let the  restaurant try to fix any problems!  

In this instance, the waitress gladly retrieved the pizza to warm it up. And she had the kitchen put a substantial quantity of sausage on the pizza.  Please refer to the before and after pictures with this review. The before picture is the way this restaurant served the pizza, which is with very little topping.  And the after picture is in my view the correct way the pizza should&#39;ve been served from the start-- with lots of topping.  so, while your mileage may vary, my experience was the originally served version of the pizza was laughably free of the toppings, but the corrected version was, well, corrected in terms of sausage.  The temperature at the pizza was better, but still far from steaming.

I might give it a second chance, and try something else off their gluten-free menu, and while I&#39;m there see if other pizzas look topped."

The food here is OK; fairly standard fare for any mall italian place.  Nothing to write home about, but in general they won&#39;t screw it up.  Had fruiti-di-mare, and to my surprise the seafood wasn&#39;t overcooked and rubbery!  (I didn&#39;t have high hopes going in.)  The sauce was pleasant if a bit uninspired.  Ordered the carrot cake for desert and was pretty sure it was just unboxed Sysco; completely tasteless except for the frosting.

Where this place falls flat on its face is in the service department.  It takes a heck of a lot to break my 15% tipping floor, but this place tunneled through that floor like there was a gold nugget underneath it.  We saw our waiter exactly THREE TIMES during the entire meal -- once to give us menus, once to take our order, and once to drop off the check.  That was it!  We had to flag down a busboy to get drinks, had to flag down a different busboy to get bread, flag down another busboy to get water, you get the idea.  Eventually tipped 1% on a $100 check and wrote YOU SUCK in large letters next to the tip line.

Even worse, management doesn&#39;t care.  Typically if you&#39;re in a restaurant the GM will at least swing by and check if everything is going OK, not at Francesca&#39;s!  Oh he was at the restaurant -- large fellow wearing a denim shirt making laps between the kitchen and the bathroom and more or less continuously keeping an eye on the house from the kitchen entrance -- but never did he deign to interact with the customers.  Fittingly, once our meal was over he apparently fell in a hole; we asked for the GM to complain about the atrocious service and nobody could find him!  After a few minutes we just left; if the restaurant doesn&#39;t care to hear about their atrocious service then I won&#39;t bother sticking around twenty minutes to complain.

He also made sure to address the issue at this particular location. I do understand that restaurants have bad days and sometimes patrons are overlooked. Being that my family was grossly overlooked the day we visited, it is much appreciated that someone would take the time to reach out.

Service is alway a excellent.  Menu changes daily but they stay with what they do best.  Appetizers to pizzas , salads to pastas I&#39;ve yet to have a truly bad experience at any of their locations.   The attention to detail shows in every aspect of the experience.

Cheese filled tortellini in a vodka cream sauce - A.  (Simple but well executed)

We had a party of 10 And no one left happy with either the service or food.  The servers were clueless as to who ordered what ... Everyone had to study their dish to make sure it was the right one.  

I had the seafood pasta and it was OK except for the shrimp had a fishy taste.  The other person who had the same dish said theirs was not spicy.  The chicken dish promised pine nuts but none could be found ..

The bus boy was clumsy and unapologetic as he dropped his knife on the lap of one of the diners.

She was good on letting us sample the wines and then  we ordered, finally. THE FOOD WAS SENSATIONAL.I had the Tuna in lemon sauce and it was in credible. Our hats off to the Chef.

But as this is the first time going here, the issues we ran into may have been a one time thing. I most likely will give it one more shot in the future. 

First off, the restaurant is extremely clean and well maintained. Staff was extremely friendly. However, our waiter did forget about our appetizer (the Bruschetta con Prosciutto, which was ok. Big pieces of bread with a few tomatoes and a small piece of prosciutto). And they ended up bringing it out with our dinner, which was a tad odd, but they did take it off the bill so I can&#39;t complain too much there. 

And I ordered the $24 (forgot the name) jumbo shrimp with spicy tomato sauce (not spicy) on linguini. It also had black olives and capers (a few to many in my opinion but it did add a nice flavor). It was an alright meal. I wasn&#39;t impressed with it and won&#39;t order it again for $24. Maybe for 18-20 dollars I would. 

The only other thing that was a little odd was that 90s Rock was playing on the radio. I would think something a tad more Italian themed would be better. 

But it was an average restaurant. Very clean, well maintained, very nice staff, food was ok but a very good drink selection! 

I will try it again at some point in the future hopefully with better results!"

The calamari tasted like it had been cooked, left sitting out and set under a heat lamp. My pasta dish was beyond al dente and the sausage tasted pre-cooked, kind of dried out. My husbands grouper was decent, but nothing to rave about. 

The bus boys were lapping the table and kept grabbing stuff off the table that was bring used or eaten. Who takes your knife off the table mid-way through the meal? And what&#39;s the deal with being asked if you want your food boxed while you&#39;re eating it!! People are out to a nice dinner to relax--and enjoy their meal, stop rushing your patrons. 

Underwhelmed and won&#39;t be dining here again. Doesn&#39;t compare at all to Capri in DG."

The waiter we had seemed like he was promoted from being a bus boy to waiter because he was rude and lacked any customer service skills. 
The food in general was not that great and my bf&#39;s dish which had Ragu sauce was way too salty to consume so we asked to be sent back and be remade. When he got his food back, it seemed like they just added a lot of water into the sauce. 
While we were all still eating with my fork still in my mouth, the bus boy came and tried to take our plates away. I had to tell him that we are still eating. He rolls his eyes at us and walks away. They tried to rush us out the whole time we were still eating and wouldn&#39;t refill our water for 30mins. I finally had to get out of my seat to find someone to bring us out water. 

And my friends are Muslim and can&#39;t have pork, on one of their dishes that they ordered they asked for no pork. But of course while they were half way through the dish they found pieces of pork in their dish....

I will never come back to this location ever again. Service tells a lot about a place.....not a good look.

Ps. Oh and the persons in charge reached out to me and said they they will send us a gift card for our horrible experience......it&#39;s been months and still have not received it."

Also, we were really hungry so the complimentary fresh bread, olive oil, and parmesan cheese held us off until the meal arrived.   

I tasted all 6 of our meals and the quality was outstanding.  I would equate it with something like Claras in Woodridge or Maggianos.  Definitely a cut above Olive Garden.  I thought an upscale place like this would have small portions, but they were a full adult meal."

Truly none of us were satisfied with our meals. I can&#39;t remember exactly the names of the meals we ordered, but all arrived within four minutes of ordering! The complaints were not near enough seafood toppings on her mixed seafood pasta, spinach was supposed to be in another pasta dish but used something else , rendering it very bitter! My friend and I ordered the shrimp pasta etc. Which was absolutely as bland and dry as can be, had only 4 medium shrimp and the pasta was much more, &#34;el dente&#34; than it should have been. None of us took our leftovers home as it wasn&#39;t worth the calories to eat something so mediocre. 
It was half price martini night, but when the bill arrived the martinis were billed as full price. 
Talked to the manager and truly hated complaining about everything, but he was very gracious and kept on saying the chef had to know to get better. He gave each of us a free entree on our next visit, though none of us has any interest in returning. 
Just a little angry having spent so much money for such lousy food, though the company was great as always."

We&#39;ve eaten in the dining room several times with parties as large as 8 people.  The service has always been good.
I read the bad reviews and honestly some of the things mentioned have happened to us: small portions on seafood dishes, pizzas not the best, bread hard as a rock.  The servers are attentive so problems get rectified quickly (I still would not order a pizza there though).

There was less than 10 tables full at the time we were there, for lunch on a Sunday, probably took 1.5-2 hours.  Our waiter took our order, we asked for more bread, and he vanished for the rest of the meal.  We had another gentleman bring our drinks, we asked him for more bread, again it never came.  Finally when he brought our meal we asked about the bread and he got it for us.  They forgot to bring our dessert until we put our coats on and went to the hostess desk.

He recommended the fish of the day, which was a great choice. The food was tasty, but it just came by itself on the plate. This seemed a bit  skimpy, it would have been nice to have a small scoop of rice, or couscous to make it look more complete. We didn&#39;t think we wanted dessert, but Wesley&#39;s subtle suggestions convinced us to have a bite. We loved the profiteroles with the pistachio gelato!

Right off the bat I noticed it was perfectly lit for a romantic dinner.  Food was wonderful--we split the Pollo Arrosto alla Romano after starting out with the calamari fritti.  Calamari sauce was unique--had a sweetness to it that really brought out the flavor nicely, balanced well with fresh squeezed lemon and a few dashes of salt.  Very nice.  The chicken was fabulous--garlic, shallots, rosemary, lemon and olive oil served with roasted potatoes--chicken was moist and tender and the sauce was so good I was tempted to lick the plate clean.  I&#39;m seriously serious.  Our only gripe was that our waiter disappeared for about 15 minutes at one point--right when we could have used refills and our check.

Our waitress would take one person&#39;s drink order and leave- getting the drinks one-by-one instead of taking everyone&#39;s order at once. Food came out at different times- delivered by food runners who basically threw the food in front of people even if it wasn&#39;t what they ordered

Half the table got their desserts at one point and the other half sat there staring at everyone&#39;s melted gelato as if the gelato had already been sitting under hot lamps in the kitchen for a good 10 minutes. Not appetizing. 

Maybe I would have been a little more forgiving if I hadn&#39;t spotted the waitress sitting in the party room (there&#39;s glass walls to the room and you have to walk by it to get to the bathrooms) playing on her phone while our table sat serviceless. 

Maybe I would have been a little more forgiving if the food was better, but I had better pesto the night before from a pre-made mix from Marianos. Oh, and my linguine that the menu boasted was sauteed with shrimp and scallops? Yeah, there were three shrimp and three scallops. The rest of the dish consisted of bland pesto and potatoes, which were way too heavy and should have been left out of a summer pasta dish. Just saying. 

I&#39;ve had decent experiences at other Francesca&#39;s around the area, but no, I won&#39;t be returning to Francesca&#39;s at The Promenade. Next!"

From the start, I was really disappointed with the menu and the selection.  It was super duper tiny and nothing seemed appealing.  However, I ended up finding a salad and pasta dish that would do the job.  The salad was really good.. and the past was just ok.  There was barely any meat in it and was just kinda blah.

The Bolingbrook  location is comfortable, with stone walls and a waterfall in the entry.  The server  (5 stars) was extremely attentive and knowledgeable about the mixed drinks,  brands of alcohol and the dinner menu.  He provided us w/ multiple drink and food suggestions.  Tried the quarto stagione pizze which sounds like a mixed up mess, but is an absolutely delicious Italian style pizza (not Chicago style)
The presentation  of the pizza was artful, w/egg a coddled in the center adding an extra layer of flavor.  The drinks were well mixed w/ generous pour.

The only negative was that they do not stock Stolichnaya Vodka.  Settled for Chopin, also upon speaking w/our server he provided a tasting of Tito&#39;s

The location and ambiance are great. The entry is upscale. The t- shirted waitstaff and flimsy menu is not. There is a warm fire in the center of the room making for a cozy winter  experience.

The service is quick and friendly, although they seem to forget you when the meal is over and you&#39;d like a second cup of coffee.
All things considered it&#39;s a B to B+ experience. There is certainly better Italian food in the region but it works as a good meet up spot or date spot."

I&#39;d recommend just sticking to Chicago pizza, or Italian pizza.  I ordered the quattro staggione... the crust was thick and doughy, laden laden with cheeze, no formaggio to be found.  prosciutto quality was not so ah great... gristle stuck in teeth not big on my list of prosciutto hallmarks.  kalamata olives? opah?  the artichoke pieces were fine.  the egg on top was a nice touch but not enough to save this heavy leviathan.   I purposely made a mistake ordering caprese salad (early March in Chicago) yet they did a good job with what&#39;s available. Moretti beer, plus 0.2.  not enough to make the experience a 3.  One trip = troppo.
 
I think they probably know their base clientele, and probably take pretty good care of them. But If you are not among them, you may wish to mangiare elsewhere."

So when the servers gathered to yak about how terrible their jobs were. I would hear everything as they were right behind me. Another awkward thing was when they served me or filled my water glass, it was from behind my head? Not to be rude, but WTH! The capriccio was a delight. I love that raw sirloin! Again with the bread. I think I went thru a loaf and a half with the olive oil, grated cheese and pepper. I also ordered the broiled chops plopped on top of a bed of garlic mashed. They were as big as the plate and just as tasty. Yes, I was doing the happy dance in my seat. I cleaned my plate and that of everyone around me.

Are you freakin kidding me?   Nope, I didn&#39;t get paid to give them 5 stars... But this restaurant rocks...

Two or three years ago... This place used to be called Woodlands... 
We know the chef, sous chef and the chef&#39;s wife... So, we were there often... Then, they closed... And re-opened a year after, I think... As Francesca&#39;s... Me  and my bf were sad that woodlands closed... So, we didn&#39;t bother with the &#34; New place&#34;

But God is good... new years eve... Our prior plan didn&#39;t go thru... So, we had to have a last minute... Where to go for dinner, before going to a friends party kinda thing.....

Went to francesca&#39;s because our friend lives in bollingbrook.....


OmG...we were totally blown away... First off, we didn&#39;t have reservation... And this place was B-U-S-Y..... However... The very nice staff, found a corner table upstairs were the bar was... Yes.... Yes.. Yes....

We were greeted by this sincere cheerful waitress, her name is Olivia.... 
She was taking  her time, explaining their menu, drinks, knowing its our first time... 

Cool thing about this restaurant is they change their menu every 2 weeks..

I definitely dig that...

For appetizer...we got their mussels... Let me tell u... It&#39;s to die for.... The sauce was just soooo refreshing, sweet and spicy at the same time.... Yummy... We know the mussel is fresh coz it so soft and juicy...

My bf ordered  a fish dish (29.99)... Which was really flavorful and melt in your mouth kinda dish... 

I ordered half a seafood pasta dish... And when they brought it out... I was like... God damn... That&#39;s half?????? It&#39;s humongous......

Really good pasta, with huge shrimps and scallops...

As I was eating... I was updating my facebook.... Checked in at Francesca&#39;s in bollingbrook.... And francesca&#39;s was giving away desserts for cutomers checked in....
I was like... Heck yeah, thats what I&#39;m talking about....

So I ordered this chocolate dessert... Sorry, I didn&#39;t get the name... But it was truly delectable.....

Price was definitely reasonable for a nice sit down restaurant.....

Now mind u, my bf is half Italian and half African American... Yes... He is gorgeous and hott, ANYWAYS, aside from being italian... He went to cooking school.... So he is a good cook.... Yes, he has it all... 

My point is, he enjoyed the food and ambiance at Francesca&#39;s as well...
We will definitely check out their next menu in a week or so...."

Went for a business dinner so wasn&#39;t picking up the tab but still....quality definitely didn&#39;t meet price. 
Lobster bisque is pretty decent, although it could have been  served hotter (a pet peeve of mine). I ordered pasta with spicy marinara with roasted eggplant. They definitely left out the spice, it was very bland. No hint of either spice or herbsneigh colleagues pasta with cream sauce, ham and peas was pretty bland also. 
service was pretty slow I thought, but we were a group of 10. 
Desserts seem to be a strong point here.  I had a hard time deciding but went with the apple tart with a delicious cinnamon gelato. The creme br√ªl√©e and the cheesecake loked equally appetizing. 
If you find yourself at the Promenade I would recommend some other dining spot such as Gordon Biersch for the price."

The menu is EXTREMELY limited with not a meatball or piece of sausage in sight. The sauce left a funny taste in my mouth. I was shocked to see some of the sister restaurants because they are more Italian than this place.

My cousin and I stopped in for lunch yesterday and waited five minutes to be seated because no one was at the hostess station. That sort of set the tone for crappy, slow service which is unacceptable in a nearly empty restaurant. 

The menu is very confusing with both handwritten items with descriptions and printed items without. I had a question about an item that had no description and the waiter acted like he had no idea what I was talking about....

The bread with EVOO and parm is really tasty. We also had bruschetta which was good and a chopped salad that supposedly had artichokes in it but I only saw one leaf. The salad was okay but nothing to rave about.

I would consider going back for dinner and trying something more substantial but probably not going back for lunch."

I had the veal polenta dish and it was amazing.  $29 was a bit steep but veal is expensive and it was soooo good!  My mom had the white fish with capers, shrimp, spinach....delish ($21)!  We shared cinnamon gelato for dessert ($5.50) - it was more like ice cream instead of gelato but it was creamy and rich and went right to my thighs!

I made reservations weeks ahead of time, so we were seated promptly (good things I did, too, because there was a line out the door!).

My only gripe is that we were seated near the doors.  Normally not a terrible thing, but for some reason everyone who was waiting for a table found it necessary to not only form a single-file line, but hold all of the doors open in doing so--straight outside!  Needless to say...it was chilly!

The service was terrific.  I&#39;m sure they were in a rush to turn tables as quickly as possible, but we didn&#39;t feel rushed (very important difference to note).  We received our food promptly.  As a Valentine&#39;s Day special, they had heart-shaped ravioli.

All in all, can&#39;t complain really.  The food was delicious, the service was quick, the atmosphere was relaxing, the decor was tasteful, and the wait staff was attentive.  I don&#39;t know why people complain about a &#34;limited&#34; menu.  I thought the menu was prefect.  I don&#39;t like to be overwhelmed with choices.

I think it was a nice looking place but the food was mediocre.

Also, we were seated by the bathroom area and it smelled like sewage or gas.... Not very appetizing. We are the types of people that don&#39;t complain but we skipped out on dessert just to get out of there.

I went here for dinner and was surprised with the temperature of my meal.  I ordered the special salad to start with (this was actually delicious and made perfectly).  I&#39;ve had their Ravioli (at their other locations) and it is always fantastic!  Unfortunately, this ravioli was not as good as I hoped.  For starters, the menu stated that it would come with Mozzarella cheese, instead it was served with chunks of ricotta cheese &#34;dumped&#34; on top of the ravioli.  I scraped it all off.  Secondly, it was luke-warm.  How long was it sitting there before it was served?  The house red tasted like it was sitting for 3days behind the bar. 

I&#39;ve always enjoyed Francesca&#39;s gelato, so I ordered the Apple Crisp with Cinnamon geltao.  The gelato was fantastic!  The apple crisp, however, was not even warm in the slightest degree.  It was tough to cut and the apples were hard.  I felt like they ran over to Mejier across the street and bought a dessert out of the frozen section, defrosted it and plopped some gelato on it."

We had a tomato, goat cheese, balsamic appetizer which was great. Then we had a salad of some sort which was fine. Last we shared a 25 dollar fish dish that had very little flavor. We were quite surprised. We both added salt and pepper. The server asked us how it was and we told her honestly. She offered to give us another dish but we had eaten so much we felt bad and told her it was fine. When we got the bill she took it off without us asking which was really nice of her.

We stopped by there for lunch today and I really had a appetite for a mushroom risotto.  

Although we were going during the normal slower time for lunch, we found the restaurant crowded due to the x-mas shopping at the Promenade. I had reservations but we decided to get seated qucikly in the bar area where the high-back seats were excellent.

We were quickly served bread and butter which I found about average for an Italian restaurant, nothing to write home about.  We both ordered clam chowder soup which was also OK.

The problem came when I deviated from the menu and asked the waiter if I could have a wild mushroom risotto. The risotto was well under- cooked and although the risotto had some cut-up mushrooms in it, there was little mushroom taste to it. I should not have probably deviated from the menu since the on-duty chef was unprepared to make this dish.

I&#39;ve eaten a few times at the Francesca&#39;s on 59 in Naperville and have always been impressed so this was a disappointment. I&#39;ll probably go back again to make sure it wasn&#39;t just a bad day for the chef."

I&#39;m not going into appetizer/dinner detail... it&#39;s Francesca&#39;s, pretty much just like in Chicago or Naperville or whatever. It&#39;s AMAZING! C&#39;mon. The Bolingbrook location has a very nice decor (what restaurant used to be here, I can&#39;t even remember), and I&#39;d say it&#39;s a little more relaxed than Naperville (surprise).

Most restaurants think chicken nuggets, cheeseburgers and mac &#39;n cheese is good &#39;quality&#39; kid food...it&#39;s not.  

I cannot speak highly enough about Francesca&#39;s and here&#39;s why:

After yet another night of little sleep we ventured out for dinner.  We ended up at Francesca&#39;s on accident.  We arrived, didn&#39;t have to wait and the hostess was smart enough to put us near the kitchen...where it&#39;s moderately noisy and away from all the &#39;romantic couples&#39;.  

Our service was prompt and accurate.  I&#39;ve never had my son&#39;s dinner arrive before he was bored with the crayons...and it did here.  Grilled chicken breast and steamed (not overcooked) broccoli.  Fantastic.

Our adult entrees came out not long after.  Fresh, hot and exactly what we ordered.  (I ordered off the menu, which they were more than willing to accommodate.) 

Overall, this place is wonderful.  We&#39;ve been back several times now.  They offer some great specials too: Monday&#39;s kids eat free.  Friday appetizers are half price from 3-6 p.m., if you&#39;re out shopping.  Sunday A HUGE bowl of spaghetti and meatballs for $10. (I&#39;m sure there is more specials too.)

This place is definitely worth checking out."

That said, this site is interesting in that the decor is a little different - more modern ... and generic - than the other sites.   Don&#39;t get me wrong, its not unpleasant.   The main room is broken up into different sections by a raised bar area that sits in the middle.   As far as the food goes, the pasta dish I had was reliably good.   Our calamari appetizer was not great, but I think that was an abberation.   Overall I would come back, and its nice to have another option out here in the suburban wastelands."

Waiter did not seem to know the menu, which was jumbled and limited. Waiter got the appetizer wrong - and then we had to flag him down to get the correct one. Food was not great- salad was swimming in dressing to the point that I gave up trying to eat it. Waiter brought a 2nd beer without being asked for one. It was questioned and he walked away. Bill came and was left waiting to be picked up for about 20 minutes. The bus boy was the most helpful person of the night."

The Francesca chain has always been one of my favorites - from Mia Francesca&#39;s in Lakeview to La Sorella Di Francesa&#39;s in Naperville, I have never been disappointed in the food or ambience.

This new Francesca&#39;s meets all of my expectations - great food, great location, great service, and all of the delicious menu choices that change daily.  I am SO happy to have Francesca&#39;s at the Promenade, and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys great Italian food and lots of creative, delicious menu choices...

Plus, they have drink specials on certain week nights, and their prices are reasonable given the large portions and variety of dishes.  This place is definitely worth an evening out, even in the current economy.

HIGHLY recommended!"

Both times I visited I made reservations ahead of time and was seated right away, which is always a plus.  Both times, however, I felt VERY rushed to get out of there.  When I go out to eat, I like to take my time, have cocktails, talk a lot, and enjoy what is happening at my table and around me.  I felt like I was not able to do this at Francesca&#39;s.  The check was dropped, card swiped, and picked up, before I was even a quarter of the way threw the glass of wine I was drinking.  I feel like they just wanted to get us out of there so that they could get the next table.

I probably will be back for a quick dinner because the food was good, but if I am looking to spend a good amount of money on drinks and food, there are much better places that will not rush you out the door."

On my new mexican restaurant places fieldtrip, I found this great establishment.  It&#39;s a small place but has amazing flavors! Like I said, their TINGA chicken tacos are da best.  The shredded chicken and the seasoning it had been marinated in is delicious.  Moist chicken, with cilantro and red onion, nestled in homemade corn tortillas....Oh my dang, the corn tortillas...you had me at homemade tortillas.

4 great salsa/sauces.  The avocado lime has to be my favorite.  The hot red creamy looking one burned...to some it may not, to me, it was too hot.  Wash it down with their yummy yummy horchata.  My only gripe: the drink container should be bigger for the price yiu have to pay.  But those tacos....OOOOOO WEEEEE!

Check it out if you&#39;re around Elmhurst. Great spot and good experience. I&#39;ll be back to try other tacos. MMmmm."

In fact I&#39;ve given it 3 tries just hoping that I hit them on an off day. Unfortunately the tacos were always extremely bland. The steak in the steak tacos had absolutely no flavor and was very dry, the shrimp tacos and fish tacos were also bland.  If your going to charge top dollar prices for tacos, almost $5 for (1) shrimp taco, then they had better be off the hook good. I&#39;ve literally had less bland better tasting tacos at hospital cafeterias.

Also this is a fast food joint not a full service restaurant so why is there almost a near mandatory tip when you place your order and pay PRIOR TO GETTING YOUR FOOD???  Tips should be based on service and not charged upfront.  Considering that I order and then go get my food at the counter why does the cashier deserve 10%, 15% or 20% tip???  And a tip upfront?  So they know when they are making your food that you didn&#39;t tip or how much your tip was?  Ridiculous. I am sorry but you do not deserve a $6 tip on a $30 order that took you 60 seconds to complete.  And with the prices they charge the owners should be able to pay their 2 staff that work their EXTREMELY well. 

I hate to be blunt but, this place will not last in Elmhurst unless they change things up pretty quickly. They may have the Elmhurst &#34;New Restaurant&#34; bump going right on now but as every long time Elmhurst resident knows that only lasts so long."

We tried: Al pastor, chicken tinga, Steak, &amp; shrimp.
Only iffy one was shrimp, &amp; only because eel sauce on a shrimp taco was a lil odd tasting in our opinion.
Salsas on offer were all delicious. (warning -the hot is VERY hot) guacamole was delish &amp; a decent amount for price.
Prices were actually great all around for the quailty.
Our only complaints/cons were the setup of the restaurant -
the way the counter is set up, U are basically right on top of other customers when trying to get condiments/grab your food, etc.
Why not setup payment counter in back...&amp;pickup in front?! Led to very awkward dancing around with others to get everything.

Other than that...this is a great addition to the fairly boring downtown food scene here in Elmhurst. will def return."

This was the second time I had been there and they are still just as good. This time I tried the hibiscus flower water, it was really good. Not to sweet just right. I also ordered three tacos, one al pastor, one mole, and one chili poblano. They were all good but I think my new favorite one is the mole one. What great flavor , and the chicken was nice a moist as well.  I have yet to try the deserts there though so will have to go back. Just be aware, the place is small so you may have to wait for a table. It is not the greatest for large groups since the place is small. Largest table they have is for four people.

I need to be.  I go out to eat every day.  Yes, 7 days a week.  So, a couple of bucks here and there adds up.  I wouldn&#39;t even mention it here, but I only noticed when I paid $8.50 for two tacos and a small horchata.  I guess that&#39;s not excessive, but at that price I really expected something special.  Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t get that.  The steak tacos were dry and, for some reason, I think I ended up with flour tortillas, or white corn (not sure), but not what I expected.  I guess I just assumed they would be corn, or that they would ask.  And, if they make their own, then that should be noted.
 
Anyway, in terms of the positive, I really liked the hot salsa.  The staff was very friendly.  The horchata was good.  Also, the restaurant, though not to my comfort, is fairly kid friendly.  At least there were quite a few kids there when I went on Saturday.  There&#39;s seating inside and out.   Would I go back, maybe, but at this point it&#39;s really hard to recommend it.  

Research:  I just wanted to make sure I was being reasonable so I checked out some other taco prices in town.  Here are the comparable prices for a steak taco:  Guac N Taco = $2.75, Cilatro Taco Grill = $1.95, Los Fernandez = $1.89, El Famous $1.47"

I was able to get 2 tacos to go. Typical taco ordering the 2 tacos, one was steak and other chicken was typical topping of cilantro and onions. Gotta give it to this place for such a small establishment the tacos are very savory. Most places i had chicken from usually make em dry and i would have to overlay it with tons of sauce, but there wasn&#39;t dry like i expected it to be and there steak was great as well.

Unfortunately, we have a lot of experience with great tacos from Mexican restaurants in Chicago and this did not live up to any of its competitors. 

I asked the cashier what his favorite thing to order is and was referred to the &#34;chicken tinga.&#34; Upon opening the taco to eat it I was faced with something that looked underwhelming and even less appetizing. I assumed it would taste great but it had no flavor, the ingredients were skimpy and the actual tortilla didn&#39;t taste authentically Mexican. Please see the picture I have added labeled &#34;chicken tinga.&#34; I can&#39;t believe it was 2.75$!

My wife ordered the steak taco and chicken taco which were both $2.75 -- you would assume at a place called &#34;guac and taco&#34; that a sprinkle of guac or cheese wouldn&#39;t be an extra .50$ each, but that&#39;s fair a lot of Mexican restaurants up charge as well. These tacos were so skimpy though...

Two stars because the guacamole was decent. Nothing to write home about, nothing new, but okay guacamole."

I ordered the Flautas (chicken and peppers in a fried rolled tortilla, similar to a taquito).These were pretty amazing, probably some of the best I&#39;ve ever had. However, the menu board said the order came with two, so I felt I had to supplement it with a side of rice and beans. However, the order actually came with 3 so the food was unnecessary. Additionally they don&#39;t have any rice (an oddity for a typical taco place) and the beans were more like a watery soup.

Boyfriend and I ordered the following: 

Tinga Taco (Shredded chicken): 5/5 my personal favorite of the day; chicken was perfectly flavored and juicy (yet not too juicy where it broke through the homemade shells). 

Steak Taco: 4/5 they grill the steak whole and then slice it to order, which I prefer because it seems to be more juicy this way. Also Had a great grill flavor.

Fish Taco: 4/5 fish was flakey and the cabbage was pickled perfectly.  Also topped with a chipotle mayo that complimented the fish and cabbage. 

Chips and Quac: 5/5, chips were fresh and perfectly salted. Quac was probably one of the best either of us have had. Creamy yet had nice texture from the avacados, a little bit of heat and a little bit of sweet!"

I tried the tinga, steak, shrimp and fish tacos since I&#39;ve been there. My favorite two are the shrimp and tinga but the main reason I&#39;ve been back is for the guacamole, it is sooo good.

I was here with a small group so we shared a variety of tacos. The steak tacos surprised me a bunch because the steak was tender and flavorable. I had a bite of the veggie taco that was the bomb. It&#39;s about time that a taco faster food restaurant has a healthier alternative for the health conscious.  I will definately visit again. Btw try the hibiscus chilled tea is a real treat

We visited Guac N Tacos for lunch for the first time during their soft opening. Staff was friendly and professional. My husband ordered the steak burrito and he was very pleased. My daughter and I shared the tinga and steak tacos and the quesadilla which were all fresh and flavorful. I also had a shrimp taco that was amazing! We split the homemade guacamole and it was so creamy and good! We are looking forward to our next visit. They are conveniently located near the Elmhurst Metra stop on downtown Elmhurst.

Guac n Taco just opened this week so I&#39;m going to chalk everything up to opening week jitters. The two girls at the front counter weren&#39;t very knowledgeable about certain products. I wanted to try the veggie taco and asked what was in it. They weren&#39;t sure if the veggies were grilled or not (they ended up being grilled but not very well). The tinga was very good and not spicy at all. The steak was okay. My friend had the fish taco and said it was so good! I&#39;ll have to try that next time. 

The place is small inside with only 6 or 7 tables to sit at. They didn&#39;t have their menu posted on the wall (they have rolls of paper on the wall that I assume will be the future menu). The prices are a bit high and kind of remind me of Big Star Taco prices ($4 for 1 small fish or shrimp taco). I&#39;ll be back to try the other items in the future. :)"

The guacamole was so creamy and full of flavor. We felt the size of the order was fair for the price. Each taco was served on handmade tortillas. They were so light and delicious. The fillings were equally favorable with fresh ingredients. The flavor of the tinga was so layered and full. Veggies were grilled to perfection. Fish was lightly breaded and topped with a tangy slaw. A variety of hot sauces positively complemented the food. The owner came over and told us all about the menu which will rotate including fresh ceviche and other classics.

I got the Shrimp Tacos which were not great; only 3 medium sized (if lucky) shrimp on each and 2/3 of the taco was filled with the cabbage.  If I&#39;m eating a taco, I want to be able to taste everything, not just marinated cabbage.  This place has potential but for $4.50/Shrimp Taco, for what I got, we&#39;ll go elsewhere - that particular taco is not worth the price at all."

Monday - $5 burger
Tuesday - Half price drafts and appetizers after 7pm
Thursday - $0.40 wings
Sunday - $3.50 Bloody Marys

The place is huge with tons of seating.  It&#39;s a fun place to hang out with friends and not too loud so you can have a conversation without yelling.  Service can be spotty sometimes.  The food is decent.  Their burger price ranges from $10-$14. Sandwiches $12-$14. Appetizers $8-$13. Irish Entrees and Boxtys are $14-$16. Desserts are $5 or $8.

Yelp check-in will get you a free serving of Irish Chips, which are homemade potato chips topped with salt and sugar.  It&#39;s addictive.  Their fries are good, if you enjoy the Burger King style fries.

There are a lot of tables near the stage, and the sound system is good too.  I came here to see Hot Sauce Committee, a 90s/00s boy band cover band, and we really enjoyed ourselves.  The cover was more than fair ($5!), and if you get there early enough, they won&#39;t charge cover.  But if you&#39;re doing that, be prepared to order a few drinks at least.

The Guinness mixed drafts are good, and they don&#39;t stop at a Black &amp; Tan.  I had a Guinness mixed draft with a black currant beer, and my friend tried one with blackberry.  The sweetness took the edge off of what I usually don&#39;t like about Guinness.  There was also a server giving out samples of Guinness Blonde and Nitro.

I later had an Oatmeal Cookie cocktail which was surprisingly good - I wasn&#39;t expecting much from an Irish beer pub&#39;s cocktail list.  The cocktail list offers a lot of options too, and prices are reasonable.

There&#39;s a Yelp check-in deal right now for free Irish chips, one of my favorite appetizers here, but with the check-in deal we didn&#39;t get the tangy blue cheese sauce.  Darn.  Still hungry?  The mac &amp; cheese bites are good too!

Despite the big crowd for the show, service was excellent!  Our server even remembered our names and kept our checks straight - I don&#39;t know how they do that.  One of my friends got overcharged for 2 beers instead of 1, but he fixed it immediately.

Big crowds mean hot.  Ballydoyle is infamously hot.  Wear lighter clothing, no joke!  The crowd here is mixed, but there were a lot of younger folks all feeling up on each other (barf.) and later I saw a guy getting kicked out - must be why it smelled like barf near the bathroom.  There was a questionably drunk/high/homeless man trying to grind on the women here too.  I&#39;m sure the crowd depends on what band is present - if you can hold your own, you&#39;ll be fine.  During the day this is actually a pretty family-friendly spot.  It&#39;s a cozy Irish pub that is a welcome addition to downtown Aurora."

They have live music here a lot , great place for live music! There is a parking garage right behind the place so parking is never a problem.
The food is great! The fish n chips is the only thing that I have had that wasn&#39;t great. My favorite is the spinach dip it comes with warm pita slices . I usually get that as my meal and fills me up. They also have a good selection of beer too, tried pineapple beer and have been hooked ever since but they dont have it at many bars. 
It&#39;s a pretty small place. The tables tend to be smashed together. Feels like you&#39;re eating with the people next to you."

guessing there&#39;s live entertainment here because there&#39;s a stage occupying about 14% of the front room. no one was playing during lunch monday which was nice because we met for snacks and conversation.
had the corny-beefy boxty which was kinda fun: meat and cabbage and different cabbage and cheese in a crisped potatoey pancake thing -- sorta like a gaelic panzerotti.
chics were repeat customers and stuck with their faves: fish + chips and corned beef + cabbage which passed muster most favorably.
eric was an agreeable host attending the beverages and the food stuffs as well. he is a charming young fellow and should do well whatever his chosen profession."

Situated right on the Fox River in Auroa, Ballydoyle is a gem. My wife and I tried a few different things off the lunch menu, and honestly could not decide what taste the best. We ate off the lunch menu, which quite frankly I was in shock was as reasonably priced as it was for the serving size and quality. Our waitress was super friendly, the atmosphere was fantastic, and I cannot recommend this place highly enough! Enjoy."

I usually go with the rueben sandwich which is one of the best ruebens in the area. The other food I&#39;ve tried has never really dissapointed, except the reuben bites. It may have been a bad batch but the corned beef in the reuben bites were extremely mushy.
   They usually have a band on the weekends where there is usually a cover charge. The bands range 70&#39;s cover bands to new independent bands. Usually we go here for drinks and the band. Drinks can be a bit on the pricier side, but it&#39;s nothing ridiculous.
   During the summer they open the back patio where it&#39;s nice and relaxing to have a few beers. The bar and back patio are along the fox river which I personally really enjoy."

The prices are a bit high, and sometimes when you just want to have some food there, you have to pay a cover charge because a band is playing, whether you came for the band or not.

If you don&#39;t want to have a conversation, and don&#39;t mind paying extra just to walk in the restaurant, then this is an ok place."

Ordered an appetizer that came with our wings after a ridiculous amount of time. Then we found out why. They were cooking the wings for the entire time we were waiting. Worst wings I&#39;ve ever had. Imagine Christmas story when they carve the turkey thats how dry they were. Server came to set the wings down and he literally guessed on the sauces &#34;this is BBQ or spicy BBQ&#34; um big difference there champ. My drink was supposed to be served in a highball and instead was served in a regular glass that was filled to the brim with ice. Will not go back.

The sign out front said &#34;seat yourself&#34; and we didn&#39;t have to wait too long for one of the waitresses to bring us a couple of menus and get us drinks.

We started with some &#34;award winning&#34; potato soup and it was okay, if nothing to write home about. With some added salt and pepper it was a bit better seasoned. The grilled leeks were a nice addition though some of them were a bit woody.

The fish and chips I had were pretty okay. Nothing wrong with them but nothing particularly special. I&#39;m thinking the fish comes in frozen, which is fine. The tartar sauce was a bit overly sweet but again it was okay.

The biggest disappointment, really, was the &#34;sauerkraut&#34; on the corned beef boxy. Sauerkraut has a very specific flavor, a salty brine to it and the acidic tang of being fermented. This was steamed cabbage. Maybe baked. Whatever it was, it wasn&#39;t sauerkraut and if they were sold it as sauerkraut they should get it from a new supplier.

I&#39;d be willing to give them another try some night. The atmosphere of the place is beautiful and the staff was friendly enough. Maybe they make fantastic burgers? I hope their other food is better than what we had because this is close enough to home and so beautiful a place that I would really like to become a regular."

We made reservations because a lot of theater goers frequent the area restaurants.  I recommend doing that especially on the weekend. Reading the negative reviews about service at this restaurant, I wasn&#39;t expecting the best experience. Happily, those reviewers were wrong. Our server, Santos, provided attentive and friendly service. The food was fabulous. The special seafood bisque served on Fridays was fantastic and rivaled those I&#39;ve had at Nick&#39;s Fish Market or The Clubhouse. They also make a great traditional Moscow Mule. The owner, Phil, stopped by our table to see how we enjoyed our meal, which was a nice touch. I saw him do that to other customers, which meant he cares about his clientele and establishment. So looking forward to Ballydoyle opening a place in my town in January. Check in on Yelp and get a free basket of yummy Irish chips."

That&#39;s about where my praise ends except for the bartenders, whom I really like but won&#39;t be seeing much from now on.
For one thing, it&#39;s a great place to go if you don&#39;t want to have a conversation because the music is so loud you can&#39;t hear the guy next to you.
The bands they get to play there are fine but not worth the $8 cover charge per person to listen to them. 
And the last time we were there, the huge/bloated j/o at the door promised to refund our $16 cover charge if our friends didn&#39;t show after we had one beer, (after a black tie formal at the Paramount Arts Center), but when we left after each buying one beer &amp; staying 20 minutes he said, &#34;I never said that.&#34;

I have come here for lunch, dinner, and even their Halloween party.  I like the views of the river from the back of the restaurant and the fact that they can open up the back windows on a nice day.  There is nothing on the menu that is memorable to me and we had a really horrible experience a while ago that just sealed the deal on me never going here again.  

My husband and I went in for dinner with the intent on using a $25 Ballydoyle gift card we had.  We ordered, of course it took them forever to get our food out when no one was there, and then gave them our gift card to pay.  The server came back and said that their machine was broken and couldn&#39;t read gift cards. It could do anything else but process gift cards? Um ok.  

I get that sometimes things break and that&#39;s just how it is and it&#39;s not the servers fault, but she didn&#39;t do anything to accommodate us when we were clearly angry. She was just staring at us waiting for a credit card.  There was no solution like they will have them fixed in a couple of hours or tomorrow or even let me go get the manager so they can explain it to you.  She just stared at us.  So we payed with our credit card and left.

My husband then came home and emailed the manager saying how rude the server was.  The manager apologized and promised to mail us another $25 gift card.  We gave them our address but never received it.  My husband emailed the manager back to say we never received it and never got a response.  Whatever, I shredded the gift card because I don&#39;t want to come back anyway."

For lunch and dinner not before a show at The Paramount, the service is usually fantastic. Despite how much I like this place I&#39;m giving them 3 stars.

Whenever I&#39;ve tried to visit them with a large group before a show, we almost always end up being late to the performance. We show up at 5:30 to give ourselves plenty of time, we think, to make an 8 o&#39;clock show. But that&#39;s never been the case.

Our waiter was great and my review is not a reflection on him, as my complaints were beyond his control and he tried to mitigate things as best he could. 
Ordered the fried pickles. Very good but there are only four in a basket which seems stingy considering the price ($8). I wanted to try something from the cider menu. Waiter had to come back twice to tell me they were out of the drinks I ordered. Settled for the only one on tap which wasn&#39;t really what I wanted. Kids and husband ordered root beers. Out of root beer. I ordered corned beef and cabbage. Twenty minutes after ordering, we find out they&#39;re out of corned beef. Something about a &#34;new guy&#34; handling the orders....
Our tab came to $75 for two adults and two kids (w/ tip) and half of what we intended to order wasn&#39;t available. I genuinely felt bad for our waiter who had to keep coming back to our table to inform us they were out of &#34;insert standard menu item&#34;.

Tonight we found ourselves in downtown Aurora seeking out a meal. After considering our options, we decided to give Ballydoyle&#39;s a go. And...this is where it begins to go downhill.
Our dining experience began with me seeking out a beer list at another table . Once found, we selected our beers and was informed by the server my husband&#39;s selection might not be available. Luckily, this was not true and he was able to get his requested drink.
We ordered the artichoke and spinach dip which is not so much a dip as it is a thick spread. A thick spread with, oddly, bread crumbs on top. It was not horrible but was &#34;unique&#34;.
We moved on to our selected entrees. I ordered the salad with tuna but asked for the wontons on the side, as I had remembered a previous experience with too many wontons. I requested the tuna raw. When it came out, my wonton strips were on the side but the tuna was fully cooked. I did end up flagging down the server who did offer to replace the salad. I ended up canceling the replacement because my husband ate his meal, had time to chat, and my food still had not come.
My husband ordered the steak boxty. The side of mashed potatoes was cold. I told our waiter who did bring replacement potatoes that were lukewarm.
The boxty itself was over cooked - the potatoes forming the boxty were hard / crispy. The filling for the boxty was good although sparse. Overall- not a good meal.
We gave our server the feedback on my husband&#39;s meal and he said he would tell the manager. We hung around to see if anyone would come by to speak with us but no one did. Which is sad because a lot can be saved just by talking to someone - whatever the manager was doing in the back must have been really important . 
Our beers were good but I think that was because they were brewed by someone else and all that needed to be done was to pour them in a glass.
I remember going to Ballydoyle&#39;s when they first opened- it was so good. Now it seems like there&#39;s a lack of quality control or perhaps excitement. Whatever it is, I hope they figure it out but I won&#39;t be back to discover if they did."

There are a couple tvs inside in case you wanted to keep an eye on your team. However,  the tvs are not obnoxiously big and there are not so many of them that one would be distracted by them.  In fact I hardly noticed them.  

There is tons of space and it&#39;s good for groups.  

I will certainly be coming back here very soon!"

We had reservations for 630 pm prior to an 8pm show. We were seated to a lovely room in a spacious booth for our party of 7. And that&#39;s where the good times rolled off a cliff. Took 20 minutes to get our drinks, another 20 for the appetizer, and after 1 hour and 15 minutes the main meals had still not been served. Our waitress barely acknowledged the delay, and never offered an ETA. She said, it will be out in 5 minutes....tick tock. Five minutes up- no food, no visit from the waitstaff or management. So, we left cash for the drinks and appetizer and saw ourselves out the door. Sadly, we were one of several tables in our section that did the same. Poor management is to blame...you cannot be oblivious to several tables walking out!! He knew something was wrong in the kitchen but chose not to do anything. So long Ballydoyle. .pog mo thoin!!!"

When it finally came out, all the waiter said to us was, &#34;Better late than never,&#34; with no apology or explanation for the wait. Our dinners still hadn&#39;t come out at 6:40 (over an hour and a half after we ordered), and still no updates from our waiter, who knew we had to make it to the play. I overheard a waitress telling another table that the kitchen was shorthanded, which would have been nice for our waiter to tell us, but he hadn&#39;t even been by the table to check on drinks. We went to the front to ask for a manager, but after waiting 20 mins, he never came out so we just gave up and left. A few other tables in our section left with us.

If you go their when it&#39;s not crowded it&#39;s very nice dinning experience.  But, don&#39;t try to go out for a nice meal in the middle of live event.  The service sucks then, and the food quality seems to take a huge step down.

GET THE POTATO SOUP!!!! It&#39;s really good.

Also a great desert is their bread pudding (which I usually don&#39;t like in general, but there&#39;s is very good.)

This place is very casual and laid back.  They have a Trivia night that is really cool too.

They also have a huge list of beers and other adult beverages.  Good place to watch a game too."

We were here on a Monday night. There was maybe 25 people. (that&#39;s counting the 7 of us) There was a very long wait for the waiter to take our orders. Then it took even longer for the food. The longest of all waits was for the check and for him to come back and take out form of payment. So if you&#39;re not a patient person you might want to rethink going. 

The place is very quaint and adorable. Loved the decor. I would recommend going but don&#39;t be to upset with the wait. Just go enjoy the food and talk with friends."

All in all, still a good experience despite the idiots they seem to like to hire.  Candlelit dinner on a Whiskey barrel in an old irish pub-style restaurant.  Great beers, listed by country or state.  Looks like there&#39;s a cool outdoor patio, haven&#39;t checked that out yet.  Rushing water below the bridge outside is cool as well.

The food has always been mediocre at best over the last year or so. Their fish and chips is bland and the last time was almost soggy.  Two people on our party had to return their dishes because they were pretty much inedible this last time. After years our family will not be returning and until they stop treating their young waitresses like sex objects I recommend you don&#39;t either.

They took our order and then returned with a glass of wine with lip stick on it and no beer. Shortly, thereafter, they returned with donuts with only one sauce (I guess they were out of the other two), gave us a new glass of wine and took away the one with lipstick. Still no beer. Finally when I saw a server, I asked for the beer I wanted. Thankfully he was quick at returning stating they were all out. He was the only ray of sunshine by being efficient and competent.

I&#39;ve never been too impressed by the food (especially the boxty...ew). Got the incinerator burger one time and the incinerator sauce was so hot you couldn&#39;t even eat it. I love spicy foods, but it was not flavorful at all...just hot as hell. Irish chips are okay, but they put some kind of sugar on them to make them sweet and I&#39;d much rather them salty when I&#39;m drinking.

I had my most recent birthday here with friends and family, and the staff were very accomodating. They worked with me through email and over the phone to help me set up a date and reserve a room....for free. They also offer specialized menus that you can design and open bars, but of course that costs extra.

The customer service you receive when dining-in is wishy-washy. I&#39;ve had great servers and I&#39;ve had very poor servers. It gets packed on the weekends and I think that has a lot to do with it because they get assigned too many tables to wait on and become overwhelmed. Like I said, it&#39;s best to just go here to drink and listen to the bands.

They are opening one in Downtown Naperville and I&#39;m pretty excited about that. They always have great events going on, which you can find on their website. Decent place overall. Nice atmosphere, with great music and an awesome selection of beer. Just need to improve their food."

Don&#39;t take her here though). The servers seem confused and like to stand around and talk a lot. I&#39;ve had a different bartender every time. They all were very polite, friendly, quick and knowledgable about their beer selection. 

I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d go here again for any purpose other than drinking, however. I&#39;ve gotten a few appetizers and an entree and felt I&#39;d have been better off just eating beforehand and not spending the money. It&#39;s not terrible but it&#39;s certainly nothing special."

The food is very good but yesterday my burger was rare when I asked for it to be done medium.  Also I really hate how their fries have that fake crispy coating on them.  Fries are much better as they are without putting some kind of gimmicky chemical coating on them.  

For the guys, the waitresses are pretty and wear short catholic school girl skirts.

Location is great.  You can walk the Riverwalk before and/or after you eat.

One time i left her a $15 tip on a beer bill that was only $15 for drink special night and didn&#39;t even say thank you or nothing) so she just gives me a rude look and says whatever and comes back with my beer.

It&#39;s nothing more than a Hooters masquerading as a Bennigans - if you&#39;ve read my review of Bennigans you know where I&#39;m going with this.

I have no interest in their food - bland and atypical of a wannabe Irish restaurant. This type of place wouldn&#39;t even survive a day in Orland Park - home to the largest population of Irish in Chicago. 

The bar service is sad - almost all domestic piss beer with a few atypical Irish beers and whiskey&#39;s. I&#39;m not a fan of wannabes and this place is the king of poserville. Lose the domestic bland junk and at least upgrade to craft awesomeness as well as offer a much larger selection of Irish imports and perhaps, just perhaps, I&#39;ll consider returning.

Tack on the cheapness that is downtown Aurora and that God awful senior citizen mouse trap across the street and you have the recipe to open the gates of hell. This coming from an Auroran - I&#39;m willing to bash that pit like area without a second thought. This place caters to the ultra meathead douche bag very well.

The Aurora location is no exception.  My problem is usually with the tab and the food.  The food is just ok.  It has gone downhill significantly over the years.  The prices went up and the quality went way down!  I&#39;d really rather spend my money somewhere else for better quality food.  You&#39;re entire party can just order sandwiches and you&#39;ll be amazed at how much you&#39;ll be paying!  The food tends to be on the greasy / bland side as well.  There are definitely other places to go if you&#39;re looking for quality Irish food at a reasonable price!

There is always a mass of people there in the evenings... A rush coming in from the Casino more than likely.  If you want a seat on St. Patrick&#39;s Day, you best get there early... I mean EARLY!  And plan to stalk people for a seat.  They have a cover charge starting early in the day (as they do for some bands in the evenings throughout the year).  Though this may be the only time of the year that you&#39;ll get to see some really good Celtic bands!"

The beer list is predictable though there are some interesting choices.  The whisky selection is very nice and they have flights which is great.  I like some of the Irish grub too, especially the bangers and mashed.  Sausages and mashed potatoes are a couple of my favorite comfort foods.  The staff is inconsistent though the Irish waitress we had the last time we visited was really charming.  My only serious knock on the place is the parking situation.  There&#39;s very limited street parking and it&#39;s not in the best place for night walking.  No offense Aurora."

Food: 4 stars... they actually have really good food here. I have tried their salads, burgers, wings, appetizers, etc! I&#39;ve never really had a bad experience with  their food. To be honest, I&#39;ve noticed the portions decreasing a little and the price point remaining the same. This is fine if the quality of the food increases, but, I have seen that flip-flop more recently.

Beer: 5 stars... the beer selection here is pretty amazing. They always seem to have something new to try and the cost for beer is pretty standard across the board. If you haven&#39;t tried it yet, get the Milk Stout Nitro from Left Handed Brewing Co. WOW! It&#39;s like the chocolate milk of beers:) Hats off to Bally for always incorporating new and exciting beer selections.

Bar Staff: 5 Stars... AMAZING bar staff... even when things are crazy, they find a way to interact and make the expereince fun. They never short pour the drinks or trade out shelf liqour i.e. you pay for one type of gin, they pour another. They take the time to make sure things are correct and that you are happy with the food and drink you order.
It really comes across like they are happy you are there. I haven&#39;t received the same treatment at other nearby bars. There is only one exception to this rule... if someone from the waitstaff jumps behind the bar! Which brings me to my next area of rating:

Service Staff: 3 Stars... This is what dissapoints me most about Ballydoyle. Service unfortunately is either hit or miss. Whether or night is busy or slow... it doesn&#39;t matter. Most recently, yesterday to be exact, we had a server that came off prickly and it felt like she really didn&#39;t want to be there... but had to be. That sucks when you are on the receiving end of it. ATTENTION BALLY: Servers are the face of your company... when they are passionate about the experience, when they can pair beer wih food, and when they show gratitude that you are there... you will bring in more money. Please, fix this.

General Atmosphere: 4 stars... You can escape in this place. It&#39;s fun and warm, and it&#39;s neat to look at all the design and decorations... most of which is from Ireland. Its great to bring friends and family too. If you haev younger ones I would bring them in the day time for lunch or early dinner. It has done a graet deal to enhance downtown aurora and I am glad it&#39;s here.

Overall Rating: 4 stars... I So want to give this place 5 stars but there is always something that is holding me back from doing it. Hopefully, they can make improvements with Service Staff and food quality. I would love to give an updated review reflecting that."

Not a big issue with service, was greeted with attitude when we politely asked about the trivia. I really wouldn&#39;t recommend this place to probably anybody I know.

Each time, I have found the staff rude, the food under or over cooked and often greasy, and the clientele stuffy.  

My least favorite experience had to be the night that a group of friends went in after parent teacher conferences (about 18 people, more or less), and when we asked if there was room elsewhere (all tables were full) the waitress was rude and told us there was no room for us.  

Yes, I know your first comment would be &#34;call ahead,&#34; however we did not know so many people would show, and the night we chose was a typically slow night.  Otherwise, we would have.  On the other hand, do you want the business of a dozen and a half teachers who need respite from the job, or no?  

Either way, we were treated poorly, and it will never again be a meeting place for any group I go out with.  

The bartender that evening was good, he actually treated us like customers instead of a nuisance like the initial waitress."

We came in on Friday when the Christmas tree lighting was over. I was worried about the wait but luckily we got in just before the crowd. 
So service overall from door to checkout was great. No complaints whatsoever. Excellent customer service. 
The atmosphere was pretty cool. Neat vibe. Music is a tad loud. Tables are small so you are close enough to one another you don&#39;t have to yell. Decor is nice. Clean lines. 
The food is really good. Small tapas portions for sharing. Chips are really crispy and thick. Bean dip has a small hint of spice. Guacamole a little more spice. Good though. 
Pica pica- Shrimp brochettes got some kick. Excellent flavor.  Small but good. 
The a toda Madres tacos are really good. Again has some heat, chipotle flavor. 
The chilango tacos were good. There was not a ton of flavor. Just decent. 
The corn!!!!  Excellent!  Get it!
We also had the mangoneada. Fresh mango pur√©e. Excellent!
The pepino is small, light and refreshing. Not much &#39;cucumber&#39; flavor. More of a margarita flavor but good.
Overall the price is quite high for the amount of food served but definitely worth a try."

D√©cor: The first thing I noticed was the curtain covering the entryway... was I entering a night club or a restaurant. Then, just after stepping through, I realized that it is probably because you enter into the bar area and it is meant to make it feel larger and/or more private? Not sure. Anyway, the bar area is pretty sizeable with a bunch of stools and a lively vibe. As you progress further in you are greeted by the hostess who is the gatekeeper to the dining room. Well, one of the two dining rooms. There is one up front (pretty small as it is dominated by a big center island table) and one in back (that, from the looks of it, seemed much larger and a bit more subdued - probably because it was secluded from the bar).

Staff: The hostess was friendly and our waiter was great. He was very knowledgeable about the menu and very friendly as well. As far as the cooks, everything came out hot and tasted fresh but we did hit a snag near the end of our meal... something was going on in the kitchen and it caused a SIGNIFICANT delay. But, it was a small occurrence.

Food/Drinks: We started off with a house cocktail (I forget which one, but it was tasty) and a Limonada (very tasty and sizable) before jumping into some apps: Guacamole (pretty meh, seemed as if it was JUST avocado...) and we added the Salsa Trio (all were tasty and the Habanero one was GREAT!). For our meal we all ordered assorted tacos and shared. We had: Pastor (one of our favorites), Diabla (meh, pretty passable and lacking... not that great), Bien Trucha (pretty enjoyable and tasty), and Pulpito (WOW! Amazing!). Each order came with four tacos and they are about what you&#39;d expect size-wise from &#34;street tacos.&#34; As I mentioned before, it took FOREVER for them to bring out the Pulpito so they gave us some little app for free - it was four chips with some kind of crap or something on top... it was VERY tasty as well. So, ultimately, the food here is enjoyable you just have to find your favorites.

Value: The prices are really not terrible and, if you order well, you will leave full (both your stomach and your wallet).

We had an enjoyable first meal at A Toda Madre and are already looking forward to returning again - we want to try all of the tacos at least once!"

Answer: when its served at A Toda Madre. At least they didn&#39;t try to sell it off as a T-bone Steak. Saying: This is the way we serve T-bone Steak with a flair you wouldn&#39;t dare challenge.

I had lunch at this upscale almost uncious, presumptuous Mexican Restaurant yesterday. I have had many servings of Al Pastor and this was unlike any I have yet to have. It left me speechless. A guest had the fish taco made with Tilapia. Some years ago, When I found out how Tilapia was raised, I swore off this fish forever. Yet here it was featured. At the urging of my guest, I sampled this taco and it didn&#39;t taste like Tilapia. All I could say was that it was some kind of a fish. That&#39;s all. 

I will say that my Line Drink was astounding and my guest said the Sangria made here is as good as Yerba Buena.  Maybe the trick is to get hammered on offerings from the full service bar; then you wouldn&#39;t notice you weren&#39;t served &#34;steak&#34;."

Came back with more guests that hail from Mexico and they too were so happy with how good the food was here as well. The food at A Toda Madre respects Mexican cuisine, so if you&#39;re expecting the kind of Mexican/Tex-Mex you&#39;d find at Chili&#39;s or Chipotle, you probably should seek your norovirus at those types of places instead. A Toda Madre is the real deal, and it&#39;s really REALLY good. Recommend reservations for large groups and in my experience the food is family friendly for kids that didn&#39;t grow up just eating chicken nuggets in ketchup too (at least, my 3 year old nephew and 16 month old niece liked it. They chowed down!). In my opinion, the best eat-in restaurant currently in Glen Ellyn."

The waitress we had was really thorough with descriptions, friendly, helpful, etc., - we shared the salmon ceviche, the salmon had little remnants of fresh fish - wish they could&#39;ve been a bit more generous, it was a lot of onions, habaneros and barely any salmon  - we had &#34;de lujo&#34; margaritas, very nice. We also had an order of octopus tacos with crispy beets which I was so looking forward to - beets were not crispy and the octopus was super thinly cut octopus which didn&#39;t really taste like octopus because of the sauce it was in - such a shame... Yes the place is trendy and poppin&#39; (for a Tuesday night in Glen Ellyn) but super noisy - we would&#39;ve had one more round of drinks, but opted to leave for a bar across the street to hear each other better... we sat at the long table in the middle of the bar...

We went after a recent Ale Fest in Lisle (Arboretum) on a hot Saturday and I had pumped ATM up so much, offered a guarantee (if you don&#39;t like it, feel free to kick me).  No one kicked me, partly because they were full after dinner and I think partly because my recommendation was enjoyed.

Gourmet street tacos is what they&#39;re known for, but the elote, guacamole and ceviche are very fresh and it all blends together for a great experience.    The shrimp and avocado tacos and al pastor are the best in my book and the soft shell crab tacos were a hit as well.

Wait times can be long, but we did go on a Saturday around 5:30 without reservations so expected it.   Good cocktails in a festive atmosphere help everything and they have a team service approach so you won&#39;t wait for drink refills, plates to be removed and food to be delivered at perfect intervals."

I thought I was going to a traditional mom and pop place so this was a really nice surprise. Housed in a corner location on Glen Ellyns main shopping strip, A Toda Madre has Stylish cozy, inviting contemporary decor,  communal table, high original tin ceilings, brick walls with hanging wall flower gardens and I&#39;m told a cool outdoor garden.

And then there is the food!!! Was not expecting this outstanding and exciting contemporary Mexican small plates and other dishes with this level of flavor, freshness and authenticity. 

So what rocked...? 

1. Guacamole del Dia, guacamole infused with fresh plum, cilantro, red onion and charred Serrano was unique and delicious. 
2. Fish of the day - The pan seared filet of snapper, I have no idea how it was prepared, just bring me more! 
3. The pastor marinated pork tacos with pineapple Pico de Gallo and salsa Morita and portabello mushroom tacos with chili de arbol-mojo de ano were some of the best tacos I&#39;ve eaten in recent memory.  I&#39;m told that their sister restaurant in Geneva Il was voted best tacos in Chicagoland which after eating these and their tacos does not surprise me at all.
4. Esquites-grilled corn,Epazote butter,  lemon aioli, Queso Comida Chile Piquin
5 Carlota!!! Mexican Maria cookies with tequila crema and key lime curd. The dense texture and tangy flavor was a big winner. 

Reasonably priced drinks.  The real icing and cherry on the whole night was Azucena, our delightful server who we enjoyed thoroughly.

The place was packed with gaggles of women enjoying a night out with friends and being away the swirling madness of home, kids, husband, chores etc. It never ceases to amaze me How groups of women, when out together can all talk and listen at the same time and process everything they are all simultaneously talking about and listening to. It is truly a phenomenon no man will ever understand (part of a long list of such stuff), but their spirit and joy in being out with each other filled the space with lots of positive energy (and noise!!! :-D)

Great time. Can&#39;t wait to go back, and try their sister restaurant which I&#39;m told has a bigger menu as well."

After waiting for about 15 minutes , we were sat across from each other at a huge high top table right next to other people. The woman next to me had to move her purse for me to sit down.

Same bartender - two new tacos - the skirt steak with chorizo and the diabla shrimp. Both were excellent although wildly different. The skirt steak is probably the closest to a traditional Mexican taco here and yet it is more flavorful with the addition of the chorizo and green (avocado? sauce). The diabla shrimp was 6 or maybe 6.5 on a 10 point heat scale - nowhere near as hot as they make it sound. Still very flavorful.

My favorite hands down is still the barriga (pork belly) tacos. 

Service was exemplary - quick, mindful attentive and friendly.

I also want to note that our waiter had impeccable timing. The only down side is the small and narrow space proved to be extremely loud; however, it was a small price to pay for what was an incredible meal.

The chips, bean dip, and salsa we started with were perfect to whet my appetite. Then...we ate until we were stuffed. 

We started with:
--Tostada de Ceviche: This was some of the tastiest ceviche I&#39;ve ever had and an very unique combo of ingredients - tilapia, avocado, chile oil, cucumber, apple, crispy leeks.
--Pica Pica Brochetas: I&#39;ll take just about bacon-wrapped anything, let alone shrimp - and this pineapple/lime/onion combo did not disappoint.

I could have eaten a dozen of their tacos but settled on splitting two orders:
--Chilango Tacos: Grilled skirt steak, chicharron, cilantro-onion, salsa verde cruda
--A Toda Madre Tacos: Pastor marinated pork, chihuahua, pineapple pico de gallo, salsa morita

And, on the side, we also shared a small plate (although, I could have eaten a gallon bucket of this):
--Esquites: An entire bowl of Mexican street corn...um, yes, please.

We also each had two beers from a nicely curated selection of both Mexican and local beers. I wish I could have hollowed out a leg for some dessert.

For this entire meal, plus drinks and tip, we only paid $75. I call that more than a deal. I highly recommend A Toda Madre and hope to go back the next time I&#39;m in the Chicagoland area."

The vibe here is lively and fun.  Sleek and stylish but still minimalisitc.  The staff is enthusiastic and friendly and their popularity doesn&#39;t seem to be phase them.

This Angeleno and her local friend stopped by here on a rainy Tuesday sans reservations and scored a table for 2 with ease.  It was around 6:30, but by 7:00, the place was BRIMMING!  So if you come at a peak time, call ahead!
Our server was funny and warm and offered up some suggestions since the menu here is full of tempting bites.  We opted for the Manoneada and the Al Pastor Margarita for our drinks.  Both were delicious.  For dinner we ordered the special guacamole of the day which was nectarine.  Yes, nectarine.  Warm chips accompanied the chunky guac and it was all delicious.  We sampled their most popular tacos the &#34;bien trucha&#34; and the &#34;toda madre&#34;.  4 tacos per order left us with FULL bellies and leftovers.  My dining companion and I agreed that the pork tacos were way more flavorful than the carne asada ones.    We had no room for dessert but it sounded amazing.

You&#39;re going to think I&#39;m prejudice but ... Ok fine I am! I am Mexican born in Tijuana and very proud of Mexico, Mexican food and Mexican drinks (sorry about the Mexican music I like some types but others not so much) and when I found this place smack in the middle of Glenn Ellyn (not a very Latino neighborhood) and not a place known for Mexican food and then it&#39;s &#34;gourmet&#34; tacos which is kind of pretentious to begin with and usually just ruins Mexican food and leaves you wanting Mexican fast food! 

I was wrong. 

I got the a toda madre tacos and they were heavenly everything from the pineapple pico de gallo to the salsa cruda, and the tacos themselves were just excellent!

Glen Ellyn is a whole bunch bigger. Still loud, still crowded and the food is still excellent. It&#39;s just not as quirky (it&#39;s in a storefront, not in an old split level home)

We started with the gratis chips.. they are very good, but don&#39;t come with salsa.. but instead a smooth bean dip. Different, tastes good, not sure how we feel about that...

We needed some Guacamole.... ordered it, and it was very good. Not spectacular, but very good.

For the meal we wanted tacos.. so we ordered two plates to share (Yay! I always get more that way!) I ordered the Bien Trucha Tacos... (Steak and Chorizo) 4 of them for 11 bucks and they were terrific.. I would get them again (oh, wait.. I have!) 

Lisa ordered the Pescadillas, so like.. this is the difference between your regular Taqueria and a place like this... also 11 bucks for 4. Swordfish taco&#39;s that were on the &#34;squirm in your seat&#34; side of awesomeness. Really delicious!

I just needed to try the drunken beans, I love beans but I found the beer taste (and smell) to be overpowering (kind of reminded me of waking up in college after a big night and the bottles/cups/smell are everywhere) I couldn&#39;t eat them and neither could Lisa. But that&#39;s just a personal preference thing.

All in all, a somewhat reasonably priced meal (expensive compared to your local taco place, but not for a very good meal) and a nice way to spend an hour or so. 

We&#39;ll be back, I just wish they were better at salsa&#39;s and not so cheap about them.. next time, I&#39;ll sneak my own bottle in (hopefully the restaurant doesn&#39;t read these reviews)"

Went there on a weekend during lunch time, usually when the cute downtown is packed and it&#39;s hard to find parking, this place was packed. And here we were- a group of 22 people. The staff here went out of their way to help. Much appreciate that as I realize how difficult it is to accommodate large parties on weekend lunch hours. 

Food - amazing tacos. Loved their signature al today madre tacos. Simply superb. We ordered almost every type of taco and each type was better than the previous. Guac was really fresh and delicious too. I will definitely go again to try other items on their menu.

Ambience- stylish/trendy corner spot located at cute glen Ellyn downtown. Good spot to take someone out for a date. 

Overall, loved this place and would recommend to all"

Maybe it&#39;s because I was expecting salsa and it was beans or something... Still not sure what it was. The worst part of our experience was our server from the start she had an attitude. We sat down for 8 mins before getting acknowledged by the server, she told us she would be with us in a minute and then it was longer. She wasn&#39;t busy busy to not be helping us. She kept going back to other tables, checking how things were... Seriously multiple times! I truly felt judged because we weren&#39;t older like the other tables and we weren&#39;t in the &#34;nicest&#34; clothes as we didn&#39;t PLAN on going there. The portions are small and come out at different times. I don&#39;t eat red meat and my BF does, we asked if we could sub the type of meat and she said no. So we didn&#39;t share, I watched him eat and then he watched me eat. I feel like there should be a way to cater to both situations. And I truly wonder if this place knows that people can truly be allergic to meats... As I am. We got margaritas and they were the smallest ones I have ever seen a restaurant serve, and for $10?! They are good, but expensive!
The good- The atmosphere, decor, is amazing. The food is great, we had steak tacos and pescado tacos. The drinks are great. Everything is great minus the service. But because of the terrible service I won&#39;t be going back."

You can&#39;t go wrong with the quality of food a toda madre has to offer. What sealed the deal for us was our awesome waitress, Shannon. She seemed like a one-lady army with almost too many tables to take care of. But, she was extremely knowledgeable and funny-while being on top of her game. Coming from the food service, I recognize good talent on the floor. Very well done. This place deserves 5 stars and I&#39;ll be sure to continue my business with this restaurant.

Our server really lacked service. That&#39;s a huge hit for me. He was a guy. Hostess girls did a great job. Place was packed, YOU have to make reservations beforehand, because it&#39;s smaller. Bar had no places to sit. This was on a weekday. 

Food, I&#39;d recommend sharing - Pricey smaller portions. 
My family each ordered something and we shared one thing/taco from each.


They start off by serving a yummy bean dip with chips. Wish the bean dip was larger. Slammed it!

The chicken pollo taco were OK. Wouldn&#39;t get that one again.
Non alcoholic orange hisbuscus drink was too sweet for my liking. Wish I tried the lime soda one. 
TACOS DONT COME WITH SALSA.... Gave to buy separate. Bummer.


Must try the rice, super delicious. 2 y/o daughter loved it. I loved it. Melts in your mouth. Filled with flavor. 


They did offer key lime cake, small piece with a little candle after my mom asked. I mentioned it was my birthday but server kinda laughed in my face. Don&#39;t even think he said happy birthday.. But whatever. Was there for the food, not him 

Wouldn&#39;t come with family again, but a place for a drink and tacos w/ friend or 2

We had dinner with family prior to coming here but my boo knew I wanted to come so we ended up just grabbing drinks and guac and chips. 

First of so we walked into a really swanky looking spot. Kinda small but packed. If I didn&#39;t know any better I would&#39;ve thought we were somewhere in the west loop and not the burbs. When we got there we were looking for a spot at the bar but that was packed but I did see a few empty tables so I asked the hostess how long. She said an hour. But then this couple got up and we were able to sit at the bar. 

I loved sitting there because I got to watch our bartender shake it up. He was using his cocktail shakers like morracas! I had the traditional Margarita and it was fantastic! So fresh and yummy! The guac came with a spicy bean dip. So yummy. It&#39;s a little pricy so i don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a good place for an everyday bar but definitely a great date night or special occasion spot."

There should be more gourmet fancy hipster tacos.  Just saying.  Our tacos were truly outstanding.  They come in a large group of four for sharing.  But I ate all mine on my own.  We also ordered the betabel salad, which was extremely fresh and flavorful.  To finish, we had the special ceviche of the day, which was salmon.  There were cubes of serano jelly on this dish that were out of this world.  The atmosphere makes the best use of this awkwardly shaped space.  The decor involves warm wood, an eclectic group of chairs that don&#39;t match, and inventive light fixtures.  I feel a good designer&#39;s touch all over this space--especially in the use of a bookshelf as a see-through  divider stocked with kitchen stuff including cook books.  (I was ready to get all worried if a chef ran out of the kitchen to consult one-but this did not happen during my visit.)  We experienced friendly and attentive service, but we also opened up the joint on a Saturday lunch visit.  By the time we left, the place was pretty full.

My daughter and I went there on Fri at 7:15pm. When we walked past the side window there were literally 5 open tables. When we got to the front there were quite a few people waiting. We were told that the first table open would be between 9-9:30pm. I mentioned the open tables and was told those were reserved....reserved?  Wth?!?  We had to be at Midway Airport by 9:30ish so that wasn&#39;t going to work.  Sorry, no taco is that good to wait 2-2 1/2 hours when you&#39;re hungry and have limited time.  Even if we had time to wait I wouldn&#39;t have waited. 

Since my daughter is gluten intolerant, our options were slim. We drove all the way to Wheaton to Gia Mia. MUCH better system for seating customers. We were running behind so I was actually going to order something to go. She sat us instead and told us she was waiting for 5 minutes for the other people and she wasn&#39;t worried because she knew another seat would open up.

I had family from out of town visiting and since I work in Glen Ellyn we yelped in the area and decided to give A Toda Madre a try.  Ohh boy they did not disappoint! 

They were pretty busy for a Thursday night, but now I realize why. They&#39;re good and they&#39;re not open Sunday and Monday. Bummer less availability. 

The restaurant was really loud and small, has a bar feel to it. I&#39;m not picky so it didn&#39;t bother me. The portions are for sharing (kind of like tapas) which I LOVE!! I&#39;m one of those that prefer variety than a large entree to myself. We ordered corn for the sides, the House Tacos, Fish Tacos, Salmon Ceviche, and a couple more dishes I can&#39;t recall. I just remembered the Fish tacos I would say blew me away. They were sooooooo moist and flakey, not over battered and oily like most fish tacos I&#39;ve had at other places. The corn was a hit, and house tacos were very flavorful. We killed everything that came out! Craving for some tacos now...lol uhhh"

The restaurant is closed mondays, which i totally respect everyone has to be closed and have some time off but it is definitely a tinier joint so the days they are open they are usually hopping! Which Is great, but sometimes I just want to be able to walk in on a busy day and be sat. But hey we can dream right?! 

The service was outstanding, the waitress was very attentive and gave great recommendations for myself and my family. She knew the menu well enough to be able to list favorites, and answer questions without looking at it which I acknowledge and look for when I dine out in restaurants. I like when the staff are educated on the menu and the ingredients. She made good recommendations and was able to tell me what to expect.

The other staff were constantly filling my water and cleaning the table so no extra empty plates were there taking up space, and I always had a full glass of water- which I love. I hate staring at empty dirty dishes. 

The food was good, not outstanding but very flavorful. Loved the Steak Tacos and the Corn side dish. The Shrimp tacos were just okay, honestly nothing special like the Steak Tacos. But the corn was my favorite part of the meal, light enough but different than any I have had before all around a great combination. 

Not realizing the restaurant was a Tapas minded feel, we ordered a few things and ended up ordering more because there wasnt much to the dishes, meaning not a whole lot of food to go around. But That&#39;s the style and Idea so I get it, more to share and more to try. Personally not my favorite type of food but hey, to each his own.

The Mojito was tasty one of the best I have had, as for the margaritas again tasty but nothing out of this world.

We came in during lunchtime. Didn&#39;t want to wait for dinner and I&#39;m not a fan of the crowds. Good thing too, since we were probably the 5th customer to come in and were seated right away.

We started off with a free botana (appetizer) of bean dip and chips. Nothing too fancy but it was free so I loved it lol! We also ordered the guacamole del dia. Both my husband and I loved it, the watermelon provided a sweet and refreshing touch to regular guac.  Could have used more chips though. 

We also ordered a variety of tacos (pescado, chilango, and barriga) and esquites. Oh my goodness. All of them were delicious! My favorite is the pescado or crispy battered tilapa with red cabbage on top. It was sweet and sour and spicy and crunchy and soft all at the same time! Couldn&#39;t get enough of it!  Loved the esquites or mexican corn salad too! Just a tad expensive for a small bowl. Nevertheless, I would have ordered 5 of those and eat them in one sitting.

As for drinks, we ordered mango juice and it was good. Reminded me of home and that&#39;s a huge compliment. :)

The elote appetizer will make your taste buds explode from all the amazing flavors in a single dish. The atmosphere is also great; it&#39;s very intimate and dimly lit. The staff is always very helpful and courteous. I would highly recommend making a reservation in order to ensure that you don&#39;t have an enormous wait; especially on the weekends.

We ordered the tacos pescado, a toda madre tacos, and sides of the arroz and esquites.  I went and picked it up, and agree with the other reviews that the space is very nice - a little quirky, a little sexy, great blue floor tile in the foyer and good color schemes.  

Summary of food:
Tacos Pescado:  ok, so we got take out, but the fish turned soggy.  In comparison, the fish tacos at del Seoul  in the city still manage to be amazing even 2 hours later, so I am sympathetic that we didn&#39;t have them fresh, but still...  To their credit, the slaw was in a separate container - great customer service to allow it not to ruin the tortillas.

Tacos A Toda Madre: Sadly, not the best al pastor I&#39;ve ever had - it was a bit dry and my husband got several not so edible bites.  The pineapple salsa was great, but the salsa morita was WAY too salty.  I mean, WAY too salty.  I tried to scrape some off, but I was still inhaling water the rest of the night.  They were good, but not amazing.

Arroz:  Freaking amazing rice.  I&#39;m going to try to recreate it at home.  Loved it, 5 stars, yay.

Esquites:  excellent - the epazote really comes through, giving it a unique flavor.  Again, though, EXTREMELY salty.  Really, back off the salt!  

So why 4 stars and not 3?  It&#39;s very tasty food, I&#39;d definitely eat there again (usually 3 stars is a take it or leave it).  I&#39;d also like to try it in person and give it more fair shot.  Also, I want to eat more arroz..."

Looking for a Mexican restaurant on way home from a charity golf event down south Yelp came thru again.   Great hip modern atmosphere and the food did not disappoint.  Started with the Mexican Street corn which was excellent.  Had the filete and shrimp skewers and finished with the flan.  Be forewarned the shrimp looks fabulous but it is super spicy and hot.  I mean Satan hot. That being said I still go 5 stars.  If this place was near my house we would go a lot.  Well done Madre.

Also, ATM takes reservations - a limited number, but it&#39;s still so much nicer than potentially waiting a couple hours.

The space feels a lot like the Geneva locations, chic and kind of airy but also a bit cramped - tables are close together and it can get pretty noisy. But there&#39;s a lot more space here, too, which is nice. 

The menu is familiar to me and meant for sharing -- so I got my companions&#39; preferences and ordered for us all. Guacamole, four kinds of tacos, the esquites and drunken bean sides. Plus drinks, of course.

The food is just so damn good. One of my friends didn&#39;t think he was a big guacamole fan, but he thought theirs was amazing. The tacos are perfect little bursts of flavor. The drinks are fresh and delicious. 

Service was solid, our waters were kept refilled and plates kept moving. They are pretty strict about no modifications to the food, though -- they wouldn&#39;t make one kind of taco without cheese for a non-dairy-eating friend. So I suggest studying the menu beforehand if you have any specific food preferences or dietary needs.

This is not a casual family dinner spot. This isn&#39;t your neighborhood Mexican restaurant that will put beans and cheese on a tortilla for your picky eater. This is a hip space and absolutely delicious experience that I wholeheartedly recommend for the food lover."

We ordered the taco&#39;s and we asked for the cheese to be removed. They told us that there can&#39;t be any changes to a dish whatsoever! I said &#34;so the point at which the &#34;chef&#34; tosses some plain ol cheese on the taco&#39;s....he can&#39;t skip that step?&#34;  They said, &#34;nope.&#34;

They put cheese on top of guacamole, and they couldn&#39;t &#34;NOT&#34; do it. Cheese on top of guacamole is not good. Tried it, and it wasn&#39;t good.

We ordered plain white rice for our 5 year old child (who wasn&#39;t offered a booster seat), and they brought out this overcooked soft, thick, CHEESY white rice. Our child tried it and said it was nasty. I tried it, and it was literally cheesy rice. We asked if they could make us plain white rice and they said &#34;NO&#34;.  

I felt like I was at a French restaurant.....one of those that thinks their sh*t don&#39;t stink. 
Annoying....on top of that, it was significantly overpriced:
1 cup of guacamole with cheese = $11
8 tiny taco&#39;s = $24
1 cup of corn = $5
2 child size Orange Juice = $10

The steak taco&#39;s were not that tender, and all they had was a blob of cheese with green sauce. That&#39;s it. 

Ever wonder what a Mexican Restaurant would be like in Wisconsin (the CHEESE capital of America)????  Try this place. They hide all of the true flavors with cheese, and refuse to leave it on the side or completely remove it.

I have been to far better Mexican Restaurants that take FAR better care of their customers.

Somebody needs to smack the owner in the face and wake him up. He doesn&#39;t own a FINE DINING ESTABLISHMENT!!! Stop acting like SNOBS. Who pays the bills? The customer!!!! Give the customers what they ask for!!!

Never stepping foot in this establishment again.

You can only make reservations a month in advance, so I called and made a reservation, I loved that we were able to get the &#34;community table&#34; since we had 10 people in our party. We decided to do the &#34;tapas&#34; style and order 6 different taco&#39;s and you are able to get as many as you want of each kind. The food was delicious, some entree&#39;s were hotter than others, but very consistent with the quality. We all agreed that over all the taco&#39;s that were eaten. The Steak with Cheese and the Chicken Flauta&#39;s were the best. The shrimp taco&#39;s were over powering and very spicy, most couldn&#39;t even finish it.

Bar service is excellent.  Still same complaint on the margaritas.  While they are excellent too expensive for amount of drink.  Stick to a beer.

The food&#39;s good and I&#39;ll get to that but here is why this place isn&#39;t for me:
* omg...it&#39;s LOUD!  Super loud.  You honestly have to shout across the table to be heard.  A certain amount of noise can really give a place energy but this was just over the top.  It would be impossible with a larger party.
* The seats are all so hard.  You&#39;re just sitting on bare wood.  

Reservations:  They say they take reservations but it seems that what they more have is a call ahead list.  Either they botched it with our party or it just doesn&#39;t work.  You have to call after 5:45 pm and just by chance I called right about then.  They said there was still seating available and to call back in 10 minutes.  ??  Being close, we decided to head over and so I called to say we&#39;d be there in 15 and to put us down.  She again told me to call back in 10.  ??  How exactly does this work??  About 5 minutes away I called again and she then told me the restaurant was full and there would be a 1/2 hour wait.  What the...  She took my number to text me when the table was about 10 minutes from being available. We got there and waited..and waited..while party after party was seating before us.  She had me repeatedly calling back when clearly there already had been a list running.  Bit annoying but if it works properly, I&#39;d say it&#39;d be a convenient system.  

The Drinks:  I had Mangoneada (non-alcoholic mango w/ice).  $4.  Pretty nice but mango needs a bit of a pop of lemon to move it into the lively and refreshing realm.  Husband had the Fresona, which he liked and then the Strawberry Daiquiri, just okay.  Both were pretty pricey at $10 for a little thing.

The Food:  This isn&#39;t your typical Mexican fare where everything is covered heavily in cheese and comes with a splat of dull refried beans and even duller rice.  Small plates...very fresh...nice.  They&#39;re meant to be shared.  We had an order of one of the grilled skirt steak tacos, the A Toda Madre tacos (pork), and the Diabla shrimp tacos.  All really good.  Add in a side of Esquites (grilled corn) and Papas (potato cubes) and we were set.  

Decor was nice:  Lots of windows.  Interesting light fixtures and succulent plantings along the walls.  Very clean and vibrant with a serious IKEA vibe.  I just couldn&#39;t handle the chairs"

This is unquestionably the best Mexican food in the western suburbs of Chicago. It&#39;s got a cool, almost city-like vibe. And since it takes me about 25 minutes to drive here from my house, it&#39;s almost the same distance as it is for me to drive into the city. So, for me to drive the opposite way of the city, it had better be good. And it is. 

I had heard that they do not take reservations, but they did take them for me last Friday night

Most of the dishes are served where there are 4 portions, tortillas, etc. So it&#39;s best to go with 4 people.If you go with two, you won;t get as deep into the menu. if you go with 6,  sharing becomes a chore. Trust me, go with 4."

My boyfriend and I came here on our anniversary after hearing &#34;rave&#34; reviews. We had high hopes for the menu, and I assumed I would have ample options as a vegetarian given this place was so hip, fresh, and sophisticated. We had late reservation on a Saturday night and had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated. The restaurant was crazy busy and loud. Decorated with the usual pretentious urban decor, The seating arrangements were cramped and uncomfortable. I was closer to my neighbor than I was to my boyfriend. 

My cocktail, some special with cucumber and lime, was delicious and I think I ordered three. We had chips and guacamole as an appetizer which was good, but nothing special. The menu is VERY limited for vegetarians. I had an order of portobello tacos which were literally garnished with NOTHING. I think there was one other vegetarian taco option but it was slathered in cheese. My boyfriend had some meat tacos, which he enjoyed. 

Our server was way overly attentive, to an annoyance. We could barely carry on a conversation without him checking in, pushing us to move on with our dinner and leave so our table could be turned over. We were in and out in less than 50 minutes, not my ideal anniversary dinner.  I won&#39;t be back anytime soon, and I definitely won&#39;t wait for a table here. Super pretentious and not worth the hype. Bien Trucha certainly isn&#39;t adding to the Glen Ellyn charm.

However, $2 for a thimble of salsa hurts. I suspect it&#39;s one of the reasons why your crowds are shrinking. People in Glen Ellyn are willing to spend money on dinner but they don&#39;t want to feel like they&#39;re getting ripped off. Of course they can afford the $2, but you gotta give &#39;em something for their money. If you&#39;re gonna charge for salsa, make it a decent sized serving of salsa. The tiny margarita&#39;s are already a ripoff, but they&#39;re so good people will put up with it. Adding a second ripoff is too much - the perception in town is that you&#39;re expensive. 

Two other notes: The music&#39;s too loud in the bar area and your server pushed us way too hard  to order quickly, despite plenty of open tables. 

The good new is that these are minor flaws that can be fixed easily. Please do it before it&#39;s too late."

We started off with four shots of Corzo. Still a fan of Patron but the chaser that came with the Corzo.....oh my. It was a bloody mary mix of some kind with just the right spices and heat to accompany it. We also got some chips and salsa which had a tasty chipotle flavor.

For dinner, we ordered tacos de pescado, tacos de arrachera, and tacos bien trucha along with some arroz poblano and papas con aioli (which tasted extra delicious that night). Everything was gone is 60 seconds! Ok maybe like 5 minutes but still, the four of us devoured our meal. For drinks we just had water and to end our little meal, we finished it off with another round of Corzo, just for the chaser. ;)

When we got our bill I was kind of shocked that the shots were $12 each, and that the waitress didn&#39;t tell us at the moment. We probably would have still gotten the first round but not the second one. Minus the shots, our food was only about $16 per person. Not too shabby! 

I had originally written a review for the one in Geneva and it looks like my pictures transferred but not my review. 

Anyways, this place is THE. BOMB. DOT. COM. I highly recommend it!!"

The food and presentation was fabulous. Our server did a great job in explaining the dishes. Try the fish of the day! It was great. pica pica was a favorite of our table as well.... And the thing with the egg..I could eat that a few times a week. The flavors are unique to the area. Also having a mix of local craft beers and Hispanic origin bears was awesome! I will go there again when I am back in town.

I think that&#39;s crazy!  All restaurants need to have some high chairs available.

The guacamole of the day, the ceviche, and the tostada de pulpo -- all so good I can&#39;t pick just one. The cazuelitas de camarones are one of my favorites at Bien Trucha and are great here, too. Both brocheta dishes are AMAZING -- filete is really good if you&#39;re looking for something not spicy. 

As always, and as many of the other reviews have said, you can&#39;t go wrong with any of the tacos and some esquites on the side!

From my experiences here, usually 4 plates fills 2 people.

Hubby had the day off, so we decided to check this place out.  We were looking forward to some kid-free time and a chance to chat.  Well, that&#39;s not this kind of place.  There was loud, pulsing music when we walked in and while we could talk, it was still pretty overwhelming.  (Wait, am I sounding old when I say that?) I&#39;m a talker at meals, so I like to be able to do it unencumbered.

Anyway, the food was great!  We had shrimp on a skewer and some tacos and corn.  The corn is the best!  We talked to them about it and they make it with mayonnaise and cilantro and some cheese and it is heavenly!

They have a call ahead service here and I guess the people that sat next to us with the 2 toddlers used.  They were in and out pretty quickly and that was VERY nice.  
They do NOT have a kids menu here and there&#39;s no place for them to run around and it&#39;s pretty close quarters for seating.  So if you are wondering if you should go with little ones, don&#39;t.

We had some alcohol here and that was very unforgettable and expensive.  We had margaritas and they were in small glasses and didn&#39;t pack a punch.  Maybe beer would have been better.

Overall, we enjoyed ourselves, but I would recommend it more for a dinner than a lunch."

But the food was not mind blowing, edgy, or anything special. Yes it&#39;s a notch above Santa Fe up the street, but that isn&#39;t saying much.

My favorite dishes have always been potstickers, egg rolls, shrimp toast, Mongolian beef, etc.

Sadly, within the past couple years, it seems as though prices have gone up while quality has gone down. The meat within the potstickers is scant; the portions for shrimp toast have dwindled - but the grease hasn&#39;t; and I could not tell you the last time I ordered egg rolls that came out warm.

I ordered online last night and the food was mediocre - as it has been for awhile. Sadly, I keep giving in to trying it over and over, because I know how good it has the potential to be. Hoping for more consistency."

They definitely have changed, and not for the better.

The recipes are different.  We have been getting the same dishes many times over the last 10 years and tonight THEY WERE AWFUL!  We have never had Sesame Shrimp that tasted so bad.  

We asked the busboy and he explained that they had changed the recipes.  We should have guessed that when the waiter could not take our order for the dishes we have been getting all these years.  

At least the busboy was honest - the waiter kept spewing out platitudes andwas completely inept.  We asked him for straws for our water, and he just dropped them on the table, after 15 minutes. Seriously, are you going to put something in your mouth that has been on a table like that?  Then when we asked for replacement straws, he brought them out with his hands all over them.  Nope, not professional.  He should have brought them out in a napkin or something else. He had no idea how to deliver straws.

It took 10 minutes for our second dish to come out and then  the noodles were BURNED!  We&#39;ve never had that before!  They used to get the dishes out within a few minutes of each other and they have never burned the noodles before.

And our vegetable gon chow dish was more like a stew or soup, there was so much sauce, even though we had specifically asked for &#34;light sauce.&#34; 

This used to be one of THE best Chinese restaurants in the western suburbs.  It is truly tragic that they have fallen so far in a very short time.  We won&#39;t be back.

There used to be some professional management at this restaurant - there was a woman who watched over everything. 

Maybe the real management and chefs were gone over the holidays or something, but IT TRULY WAS AWFUL and not worth the money."

I was a little worried because HOE has gotten some one and two star reviews lately.  I don&#39;t know when those Yelpers were in but our experience was quite different.
We were there for dinner, 6:00 PM, on a Friday.  The first thing we noticed was a number of to-go orders on the counter.  From our table we could see the front counter.  There was a constant stream of people picking up to-go orders the entire hour that we were there.

We were seated and our server, Ham, was there with water and a pot of hot tea almost immediately.  We started with 2 glasses of wine, hot and sour soup and some spring rolls. The soup was not gelatinous like a lot of places.  The soup was good but the flavor was helped by a good shot of soy sauce.  The spring rolls were crispy.  The wrappers were a little thick making them hard to cut.

Next we ordered shredded beef tenderloin with vegetables and vegetable chop suey.  The beef was a little soft but the dish was otherwise very good.  The beef dish had fish sauce in it.  Maybe this is because it was in the &#34;Traditional Chinese&#34; section of the menu.  The chop suey was also good but needed a little more flavor.  Maybe some garlic.  The real test is &#34;Would you order it again?&#34;  For everything we had the answer is, Yes.

Our server, Ham, provided excellent service.  He was polite and efficient.  Dirty plates were removed promptly.  He always asked before he took anything off of the table.  After serving food he would wait a few minutes and then stop by to ask if everything was OK.

We will be back."

I had scallops which were perfectly done, served on a bed of rice with some fabulous sauce . My husband had  shrimp tempura done as light as a feather and  a beef entree. 
Don&#39;t let the strip mall location, decor and appearance fool you. Wish it was closer to home!
Now, I would not demote a star but we were disappointed that they close rather early, 9 o&#39;clock. We felt a little rushed through our meal as the server had told us that before we ordered that the cook was about to leave."

To a point I wanted to talk to the chef but my husband stopped me saying they might put something special in our meal when we come next time as we live so close. Well...

I got two Groupons so I decided to try something different in last two weeks we ate there. 

Shrimp with lettuce wrap. It has all the good ingredients but why we need the soy sauce in it? It looked and tasted like P.F. Chang&#39;s lettuce wrap in a bad way. 

Szechuan Green Beans - old beans and overcooked. It is supposed to my kids go-to veggies but got ignored entirely after they tried first two bites.

Pork chop with pepper and salt. It was pretty good the first time and my son eat a lot. But second time it was not crisp anymore and lack of the flavors. Yes, we have boxes of the leftovers. 

Fujian fried rice and Fish fillet with mixed vegetables are still really good."

The food was disgusting.  Both orders unedible, except the small carton of egg drop soup.  It was as if the food, including the egg rolls, were made years ago, taken out of the freezer and microwaved before being boxed up for us to take home.  Ugh!  Mine was as if someone semi cooked ramen noodles and threw them over gross slimy salty sauce with a few soggy vegetables.  Just awful.  Makes me sick to even think of it.

1st) Tied between the potsticker and the egg roll.  My Gawd, both were awesome!
2nd) Crab Rangoon.   Very edible, but most places make Rangoons very edible.  I&#39;ve had better.

Customers, let me tell you just how TERRIBLE HOE actually is. Despite your possibly quaint Chinese dining experience in the dining area, it is most likely not a good idea to go back ever or even think about stepping foot back into that evil establishment that is willing to ruthlessly cut corners in the kitchen at the cost of all customers for its benefit.

First, if they tell you they use chicken broth, that is a LIE. They use MSG in ALL of their dishes. The &#34;chicken broth&#34; is faux pas.

All customers that have loved wonton soup, be disappointed to know that 90% of the wonton soups are MICROWAVED because management tells the employees they do not have time to wait for soup.

They exploit UNDERAGE high school student employees to mix and serve alcohol for them.

Your food is most likely horribly RECYCLED in some way.
The leftover bowls of white rice that you may not want to pack up with the rest of your meal... it gets recycled into congee. I have even seen some discolored saucy rice get recycled... Perhaps you are a fan of their appetizers... Well, unfortunate for you, they redistribute sauces leftover in the saucers from appetizer orders for future ones. Sometimes employees are so overworked and understaffed that they become lazy and even recycle sauces with pieces of leftover egg roll.

Also unfortunate for all customers, the food handling is EXTREMELY DIRTY. Waiters will touch egg rolls or even pick up dropped entree bits with their bare, unwashed hands and throw them back on to plates. Sometimes waiters will do this even immediately after peeling pea pods (yuck) and I have even witnessed employees picking food off of the kitchen floor and replacing it on the plate.

The place is overpriced for a crudely arrogant, less-than-mediocre establishment. Hope you stop going to HOE and start going to better run places where customers come first."

While it was serviceable I can&#39;t say that I was blown away. 

We got potstickers as an appetizer (the pork filling was such a big, packed wad that it was hard to eat as one bite, yet trying to bite it in half made the dumpling implode), then ordered two dishes off the Emperor&#39;s Specialty menu to share: Shrimp and Scallop in Walnut Sauce &amp; Szechuan Stir Fried Noodles. 

To my mind, the seafood dish was more successful; the glazed walnuts were tasty and the seafood was plentiful, though there was a bit much of the creamy sauce (at least it was not too thick or mayonaisse-y, as at some other places. Still, I have had versions of this dish done with a lighter touch elsewhere). 
The noodles weren&#39;t as great: for one thing, the meat seemed rather skimpy, and the noodles were very hard to pick up either with chopsticks or fork (and this is not our first time around the block with either), seemingly due to their length.

Service was fine, as was the setting, but overall I wouldn&#39;t be compelled to return with so many other Chinese places around town. The emperor will have no regular in me."

It&#39;s quite decent for a Chinese restaurant and is more upscale than most you see in the burbs.  Strangely enough, I had eaten here at least 5 times in the past 2 months.  One time, I even came here 3 times in 2 days!!  They do stand out from other Chinese restaurants because their inside decor is nice, the place looks clean and that their menu actually seems authentic, far apart from your Panda Express.

I would totally give them 4 stars but I&#39;m going to refrain from doing so and give them 3 stars because

The service... 

This is something that they can work on.  When I was there last month with a friend around 7:50pm, we barely made it past 8:30pm.  A certain female waiter kept coming around to ask us if we are done every 5 minutes!!!  We kept telling her we&#39;re were not done and she would leave us alone but kept looking over at us as she clears the other table.  She also didn&#39;t refill our water and we had to ask.  

Finally, we felt so uncomfortable, we finally left, short of being picked up by the collar and scooted out the door. I looked at the tables next to me and I realized other people were leaving too (probably due to the same reaction).  I asked the manager on the way out what time the restaurant close and was surprised to hear that they closed at 10:30pm!! There was still 2 hours left and the place looked near empty! I really don&#39;t know why they were rushing their patrons out.  Maybe it was just that one lady but it really gave me a bad impression of their service: classy restaurant with express-rush-you-out service.  It just doesn&#39;t go well together.  If not for this, they would definitely get 4 stars from me.

As for the foods...  

I&#39;ve had the fish fillet congee- fresh fish during their lunch hour.  It comes to around $6 but if you are feeling a little tired or just under the weather, this light dish is for you.  It&#39;s also my mother&#39;s favorite dish and she&#39;s a picky eat-out person.  What I like about it is that the fish in here taste fresh and it doesn&#39;t smell.  It can taste light enough (not too salty) although it depends on the day. 

Another dish I&#39;ve tried is Hawaiian fried rice.  I&#39;ve had better else where before, I won&#39;t lie.  Their rice was a bit dry and the shrimp was small.  They do a pretty good job on their Veggetable Kow which is an assortment of stir fried veggies and they leave the greens crunchy just how I like it.  The Fish Fillet Kow also has those veggies with some battered fish and savory sauce as well.  Overall, their food is decent, they don&#39;t drench it oil and it can be tasty.  Though, I normally just carry-out instead of dine-in now.

The last few years I&#39;ve been going less and less and I guess it&#39;s because the food doesn&#39;t seem as good as it used to.

Hot and sour soup barely registered any hotness at all.  It wasn&#39;t very sour either -- more salty than anything else.

The sauce on the Hunan Chicken also was nothing to write home about.  Was sweeter than I would have liked.  And again, not very spicy even after telling them it was ok to make it spicy.

But the biggest disappointment were the egg rolls.  They were soggy and tasteless.  I kind of felt like I was eating a wet sponge.  The phrase &#34;hot mess&#34; entered my mind as I was eating them.  I couldn&#39;t even finish it.

Although lately I&#39;ve felt like giving only one star I&#39;ll give two because they used to be better.  I doubt I&#39;ll ever go back."

Hot and Sour Soup - Neither hot or sour. Needed more white vinegar and white pepper.
Szechwan Green Beans - Was missing the Szechwan heat. No red chili pods in my dish.
Lemon Chicken - Imagine a blanched chicken breast with lemon pie filling dumped on top.
Beef with Orange Peal - Over sized chunks of beef with no orange peel or red chili pods.
Shrimp Fried Rice - Under seasoned and blah.

The food is mediocre, but the service was absolutely horrible!
It could be just that one waiter we got stuck with tonight. But as soon as we were done saying what we wanted, he snatched the menus--literally pulled them out of our hands! By the way, he never asked us if we wanted the full or the half serving-- and both of us ordered an entree each, so I had assumed that he would give us the half order. WRONG! He served and charged us for way too much food without even asking us! He brought our food, then never, not once, came back to check on us for even a half-hearted &#34;are you doing okay?&#34; My boyfriend had to go up to the counter to ask for chopsticks and paper napkins.

Only when we were unhappily finished and ready to pay, did he show back up. He dropped off our huge leftovers and some fortune cookies, and made us wait even longer after that to get our check. Oh, and get this. He tried to SNATCH MY DEBIT CARD OUT OF MY HAND, EVEN BEFORE HE BROUGHT US OUR CHECK!!! He brought over the check and waved it in front of my face and told me what our bill was instead of setting it on the table and letting me look it over, like any other normal restaurant does. I was so outraged!!!

My boyfriend and I had met there after work to celebrate a minor, but nonetheless special occasion. This waiter completely ruined our evening, and we both felt like it was a waste of time and money eating there. Sure, my boyfriend works construction so he may not have been the best-dressed, but we still ran up close to $50 between the two of us with the appetizer, tapioca drinks, and the UNAUTHORIZED full-size entree bills! Our waiter was too busy running around to all the other tables around us that had older, nicer-dressed people seated. We felt invisible, discriminated against, and absolutely regretful that we ever decided to eat there. We will never make that mistake again."

Hot and sour seafood soup was the best dish.  Well-balanced flavor. Generous portion, enough for four small bowls.

Onion pancake was also generous portion, eight pieces in all. Nice and crispy though somewhat bland.

Moo shoo pork was nicely prepared, and again plenty of food for four or more people in large order, but strangely only four pancakes for such a large amount of filling.

Two serious disappointments: Szechuan green beans and Ma Po To Fu. Not a hint of Szechuan peppercorns in either.  Not bad, just not great; and the To Fu was better rewarmed the next day. Small Ma Po To Fu was plenty for two or more people. Large green bean portion was generous.

Service was quick and friendly, and server cheerfully boxed up all our left-overs.

We came up to Naper Boulevard and I saw House of Emperor out of the corner of my eye. This place is right behind my doctor&#39;s office, and every time I have an appointment I consider getting takeout...I&#39;ve just never done it. Well, last night I was finally hungry enough to pull into the parking lot. I&#39;m glad I did. 

First off, the menu is huge! We were really impressed by the sheer number of offerings, especially for vegetarians. I also liked that they offer both full and half sizes of their entrees, since I usually wind up with more than I&#39;ll ever eat. My boyfriend and I split the full size of the Tofu Country Style. It was delicious! It was just spicy enough, the vegetables were fresh and crunchy and there was more than enough for the two of us to share. We had plans to take some home...but it was so good that we ate it all! 

We also split an order of the spring rolls, which were just kind of meh. We both appreciated how attentive the service was and enjoyed the complimentary hot tea. It was also a great value. Our giant entree and spring rolls only cost a total of $14 (keep in mind, we had a vegetarian entree, which are usually less expensive).

I like that I can place an order online and get a 10% discount. I&#39;ve never had a problem with the online ordering...yet. I have to admit we&#39;re cheating on HoE with another Chinese place in Lisle. I hope we can still be friends.

I usually get the Sweet &amp; Sour chicken. The small portion is the perfect size for me, but if you want leftovers be sure to get a large. MadDog has gotten the beef &amp; broccoli, orange peel chicken and the General Tso&#39;s chicken (the second being what he gets when he wants spice.) The take-out comes with rice, so don&#39;t order extra on accident. Once again, my love of fried cheese means we have to get the crab rangoon, which I will say are usually filled well. 

We haven&#39;t really been blown away by the food, but it certainly isn&#39;t the worst Chinese take-out we&#39;ve gotten. Not sure how glowing that is, but I&#39;d say we&#39;ve had an average experience with the take-out."

I had the Szechwan noodles with beef and chicken and found it very flavorful and spicy (medium heat). Pot stickers were a bit doughy but had good flavor. Beef moo shoo was very good. Chicken broccoli was really a chicken in garlic sauce (again gelatinous ) with some broccoli and carrots thrown in. Egg rolls were good, not terribly greasy and mustard was good. Our server was very good. When my wife didn&#39;t like her special order she gladly replaced it with another entree at no charge.

It consistently provided above-average Chinese food.  My family of five typically ordered the following dishes:
-Shrimp Egg Foo-Young
-Cantonese-style noodles with fish filet
-Fried rice (chicken or some other variety)
-Shredded Pork (spicy)

The service is mediocre and the wait can be long, but if you go early (5:30 or 6 P.M.) the wait shouldn&#39;t be too bad.  We have also gotten take-out since my dad is the kind of person who never likes to go back to a place if a waiter during an isolated visit happened to be having an off-day and provided subpar service.  

I really like the Cantonese-style noodles - they&#39;re crispy but, when soaked sufficiently in the salty seafood sauce that accompanies them, they attain a crunchy to soft texture that is quite tasty.  The fish filet makes the dish expensive (the large size is $14.95) but the portions are generous and the fish goes well with the Chinese vegetables.  If you order take-out, make sure you specify the &#34;Chinese&#34; (C) version on the online menu for that dish.  

You can get a 10% discount if you order online with credit or debit card.  Online coupons may be available as well.  Also, the fortune cookies at this place are usually better than those at other Chinese restaurants; look for the red and yellow lettering (red lettering trimmed with yellow) on the packaging.

I got the turkey sandwich on a pretzel bun. I love pretzel buns but this one was just ok. 

I do like the interior. It&#39;s very cozy but there is only one outlet so if you are coming in to use the free wi-fi and get some work done, expect to get creative to plug-in your laptop. I&#39;ll definitely be back but the prices aren&#39;t the best."

I used to frequent the one in Wheaton until they closed. I was craving a salad the other day, and after looking at the menu online, I decided to give their Mozzarella Tomato Arugula salad a try. I opted for the &#34;trio&#34;; two Mozzarella Tomato Arugula salads and a cup of the Roasted Tomato Basil soup. 

I placed my order online before work and specified an 11:45 a.m. pickup time. I&#39;ll spare all the lame details between getting there and getting back to work, so I&#39;ll jump ahead. The pictures online are deceiving though. For almost $9, I could have made my own soup and salad with three times the amount of food. Small portions, big price tag.

The soup was quite good. However, they put the &#34;spicy&#34; croutons in the soup and not on the side. By the time I got around to eating it, the croutons had obviously softened and absorbed much of the soup. When I ordered online, there was no option to have the croutons on the side. Pretty disappointing.

The salad was good. The mozzarella was fresh, as were the tomatoes. I loved the arugula, but hardly detect the basil. The lemon garlic dressing was a bit heavier than I would have liked; it drenched all the greens to the point of extreme sogginess. Again, there wasn&#39;t an option to have the dressing on the side.

Other items I&#39;ve tried include the Santa Fe Ranch Salad, the Ham on Pretzel signature sandwich, Lemon Chicken Orzo soup, and for breakfast, the Anaheim Scrambler.  

All in all, the food was okay but I don&#39;t plan on making CBC a regular in my lunch rotation."

It&#39;s got lots of parking, pleasant staff, a short wait for food, and they get our order consistently correct. CB ends up being a dollar or so more than similar restaurants (Panera, Noodles, etc) but the food quality and selection is much, much better in my opinion. I am obsessed with the chicken pomodori panini and order it with avocado every single time. It&#39;s greasy, it&#39;s flavorful, it&#39;s melty, I adore it. I have never ordered something I didn&#39;t like here. Their chips are kettle style and super crunchy, and I often order a little something extra from their bakery, and am never disappointed (mini Bundt cake! Red velvet mini bundt! Any kind of mini bundt!). For a &#34;fast food&#34; chain place that is better quality than the standard McDonalds but more delicious than Panera, Corner Bakery is a great compromise."

There was a container of sliced lemons by the tea and they looked old and turning brown. Needless to say didn&#39;t add those to my tea. Turned around to find a seat. At least 5 out of 6 of the booths had plates and food/garbage on them. There were barely any people in there yet. After finding a place to sit we ate our lunch. I had the butternut squash soup and chicken pesto sandwich. It tasted ok. But within an hour I got very sick. Hmm, maybe the cleanliness of this store? Management needs checked up on.

I&#39;m more of a Panera fan. I&#39;ve been to CB a number of times over the years in multiple states, but I&#39;m never really thrilled with my entree. My husband received a free combo somehow, so we went to redeem. In doing so, they won me over with the panini I ordered. I&#39;m not usually a fan of a bunch of grilled veggies slapped on a piece of bread. They&#39;re hard to eat, often soggy, and almost never have good flavor. Except, this was possibly the best panini vegetable sandwich I&#39;ve ever had. And for those veggie AND meat lovers, I bet it would be excellent with a little turkey added on.

I had the California Grille on Harvest bread. The veggies were all diced, grilled, and tossed in a pesto sauce and then panini-grilled with a slice of provolone. No sogginess here. I&#39;m not kidding... it was exceptional. I ate every bite and was sad to see it was gone when I finished. It came with a pickle and potato chips for about $6.50. It wasn&#39;t much more expensive than I would&#39;ve spent at a sandwich joint for the same thing with chips. 

I would definitely have that same sandwich again. My husband&#39;s combo was good as well-- a half turkey sandwich (with a hearty portion of bacon and avocado) along with a side tomato soup with homemade croutons and chips/pickle. 

Favorable experience for sure."

That being said, you&#39;ll be charged with swanky prices as well. I went here on a promotion to get a free BLT mac. I ordered an additional lemonade and side Cesar salad. The mac was really good, but small for a normal price of $6.50. The lemonade was pre-poured in one of those open deli refrigerators. - ice-less, of course. If it wasn&#39;t the only non caffeinated option besides water, I would have declined. The Cesar was big, but over-dressinged. Yea, that&#39;s a a word now. The salad dwarfed my main dish in size.

Each time I walked away with one complaint or another. One time the food was incorrect. Another time it took unduly long to receive the food. Another time they delivered my order to someone else and that person&#39;s order to me, and then behaved as though I am the one that is to blame. From my experience at this location, I found attention to detail to be completely lacking. On top of that in my opinion, the training of the staff is very inconsistent because one staff seems to know it all and then I come back a few days later and another staff knows nothing about nothing. From my experiences here, I found the food to be pretty average for the prices charged. One time my sandwich was partially burnt and the manager refused to provide a replacement. Another time the food had become almost cold by the time it was brought to my table. During a recent visit, I ordered several gift cards and also made a catering order. Staff did not know how to work the computer system. Took them half an hour to figure out how to issue gift cards. They blamed it on a new computer system. To their credit they did offer me free coffee during the wait. A manager intervened but even she did not know anything and had to make several phone calls. I wanted one receipt for all the gift cards but they gave me several receipts stating they did not know how to print one receipt. Then they said they do not know how to put the entire amount on one gift card because the new system was not accepting the input!  I provided specific instructions for the catering order, but noticed that none of my instructions had been recorded on the invoice. Went back to inquire. They said it will be taken care of. I am waiting to see how the catering order is fulfilled. If it is not done exactly per my instructions this will be the last time I order from this location."

I&#39;m fine with a neutral experience and I certainly don&#39;t expect to be &#39;wowed&#39;. Unfortunately, I had a much-less-than-neutral experience two days ago. The purpose of my visit was a casual business meeting; I met two associates there at 10AM. When I first arrived, I was the only person in line and stood in line for 5 minutes while NO ONE was at the register. Not wanting to keep the other two waiting, I left the line, sat down and we started our meeting. A while later my stomach was really grumbling so I went back up in line. Again, no one was at the register, even though it was a bit busier; this time there were other people waiting to place orders. There were employees in the restaurant, but they were doing other things with no sense of urgency in helping customers. Again, I got out of line and went back to sit down. After another twenty minutes or so (and a third interruption to our meeting), I decided to stick it out and wait in line. When I got in line the first time, I intended to order the steel cut oatmeal. By the third time in line, it was past 11:00 and they no longer served it!!

Finally at the register, the cashier was in the middle of taking my order when a woman who appeared to be a manager walked up to the cashier holding an empty carton of milk and started asking the cashier questions about the milk, as if I wasn&#39;t standing there. WTH???

I went to the soda area to get a lemon slice for my water and there were no utensils to pick up the lemons. No employees were within ear or eye shot of me, so I had to grab a lemon with my fingers from the bucket, being careful not to touch any of the others. Nice and sanitary, huh? 

Lastly, even though plenty of employees walked past our table, no one ever came by and picked up our empty dishes, even though they were stacked at the edge of the table. All three of us ordered our food at different times, which meant employees were at our table more than once. That means that multiple employees have no clue about good table maintenance.

I couldn&#39;t wait to get out of there and I&#39;m recommending that we meet at Atlanta Bread Company or any of the other 5 or 6 restaurants in that same area next time (Red Robin, California Pizza Grill, Chipotle, Rock Bottom, Stir Crazy...plenty of choices). Again - I don&#39;t expect a WOW experience but this was just one huge disappointment. Get it together!!!"

On our first visit to Niche, it was for a late dinner around 9pm.  There were many tables open and we were seated right away.  The d√©cor was upscale and classy, lots of wood and leather.

Waiter: Hello! Have you guys been here before?  I think I remember seeing you here.

I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s a strategy he uses, and that if when correct is rewarding, or if we have a doppelganger out there.  In any case, our waiter was very good at this job!  He was warm and welcoming.  He made all the dishes on the menu (and the specials off the menu) sound amazing.  He even tried to upsell me on my drink when I went with plain old water.  &#34;Are you sure you don&#39;t want a diet Coke? Don&#39;t drink soda? We also have iced tea.&#34;  All I could think about was why he suggested DIET!?!?

The food was fabulous!  Each dish didn&#39;t just look beautiful, but tasted as good as it looks.

Pork Belly Fried rice $8 - My favorite dish here.  Get the share portion because you cannot have too much of this delicious tasty dish.
Niche Burger $12.50 - Great burger, comes with bacon, lettuce, tomato, white cheddar and a side of crispy fries.
Lo Mein $12 - Noodles were perfectly cooked with great flavors.
Soft Shell Crab $19 - Pricey but yummy.
Steamed Buns $13.50 - Fluffy and succulent.  These came with flank steak, red cabbage kimchi, scallions and sauce.

Before we parted ways, the waiter told us to come back to check out half price draft on Wednesdays and that they&#39;ll soon have Zombie Dust on tap.  Oh, he&#39;s good!

Located in downtown Geneva next to the post office.  There are plenty of free street parking nearby."

I met a colleague for dinner on a Thursday night. 

One of the highlights of the night was service. It was simply perfect. Our waiter cared, was observant without overwhelming us and really made our experience perfect. 

I started the night with one of their &#34;unbelievable selections&#34; of bourbon. I had a &#34;tasting pour&#34; of the Jefferson 21 year old. It was wonderful. A tasting-pour is 1 ¬º ounces, while a full pour is 2 ounces. It was really good. 

My colleague had a glass of Cabernet. It tasted a bit off, almost jammy and we almost thought that was the way it should taste. The waiter noticed that I also tasted it and came over to ask about it. 

He insisted that he take it back, they opened a fresh bottle and it was a really good cab. I ended up having one with my dinner.  

For appetizers, we split the Scallops and the Seared Scallops with buffalo fried oysters, and the Steamed Buns with sweet and sticky flank steak. 

They were both fantastic. The buns were really fantastic, great texture, soft and just the right chew, while the stuffing was really GREAT flavor, just enough kick.  They were served in a taco shape (check the photos) and were great. 

The Scallops were really good as well. They were served with some crispy rice which was an interesting texture. Really enjoyed that dish.

For dinner with actually split the Cornish Hen Roulade.  We wanted to stay with a small-plate theme so we could try different dishes. They actually brought us 2 plates, each with our portion beautifully arranged. You wouldn&#39;t have known we were splitting a dish. How awesome was that. And it was fantastic. The flavor in every part of that dish was really great. 

For dessert we tried the BlueBerry Fritters and the Pineapple Crisp.  They were also a hit. 

We will be back (even with the 90 minute travel time to get here). This place is a hit."

We got the cod entry which very well balanced with capers and presented beautifully. 
Dessert was their take on a peach cobbler instead of peach, it was pineapple. I liked it. 
I would describe the experience as upscale. The added perk is that it is located in downtown geneva, one of my favorite suburbs in chicago, after dinner, take a lazy stroll around the downtown area and stop by some of the neighborhood coffee shops"

Did I say that I love venison and Niche not only has a kick-ass venison app but their venison tenderloin was delicious. 

I&#39;ll break it down. The app was the meatballs and it came in a little skillet with a puree that was delicious but with this pomegranate syrup that didn&#39;t seem like it was glorified POM juice and the little pomegranate seeds helped round out the flavor.

Steam buns. STEAM BUNS?! Yeah, and honestly? They were great. I&#39;m a little wary of fusion type buns-some of them are just super overloaded but this one was stuffed just right with steak and veggies.

For dinner I of course, got the venison-if you hadn&#39;t picked up on that already. Cut to the perfect thickness, with the kale, onion  and the jus. The naturally lean venison was balanced by the buttered kale and the rich jus.

On top of that, their beer selection is top notch. Our group of four went through 3 or 4 different beers all hand picked and it seems like they consciously matched their beers to the food. I couldn&#39;t have had a better meal there."

It was always on my list of places to go, but after a number of years, never went.  Finally pulled the trigger, and boy am I glad I did!  One of the best restaurants in the suburbs.  First thing to strike me as amazing, is their beer and wine selection.  You will not find a better beer selection at a restaurant.  There were so many high end premium craft beers (think Sam Adams Utopias, Deschuetes The Abyss kind of stuff), that I felt like a kid in a candy store again.  They won&#39;t come cheap, but then again, you can&#39;t get them anywhere else either.

My wife and I shared the meat and cheese plate to start, which was top of the line.  Very large and probably could have fed four if needed.  Next, we had the Duck special of the night.  Duck was cooked perfectly.  We finished off with their dessert trio of the night, consisting of the Shot &amp; a Beer cake, Creme Brulee and Caramelized Bananas (ala Foster).  The entire meal was amazing!  To cap it off, the service was impeccable!  Not overbearing, not inattentive.  Our waiter had a ton of suggestions, some that we followed and some that we passed on.  He was great though, and we really appreciated his service!

 It is a high end, classy, restaurant and the main seating area has limited hours (5:30p to 9p).  Bar stays open until midnight though with a limited menu, so if you are in the area late night, feel free to stop in.  This place is perfect for a special date night, birthday or anniversary celebration.  Make sure you make reservations though, especially on the weekends.  We arrived at the 5:30p opening, and by 6p, the restaurant was packed.  So good and we can&#39;t wait to come back!  Might come back just for some more dessert!"

Most clientele wore business casual or respectfully dressed down except for one bearded gentleman who was wearing shorts, flip flops and a tank top at the bar.  It was Swedish Days, and it was humid, in the 90s, but why go out of your way to create an elegant dining experience if no standards of dress are to be enforced.  I am not a snob, I just expect a certain amount of decorum when spending over $200 on a romantic special occasion event.

We were walking around downtown Geneva with no plan when we walked pass Niche. I was immediately drawn in by the chorizo flat bread, while my boyfriend was drawn in by the Gumballhead Beer on draft. SOLD. 

This place in NICE. Cleanly decorated and laid out, with splashes of color and very elegant, yet they achieve a semi-casual feel which is my favorite. 

For drinks; my boyfriend got the Gumball Head ( a three floyds beer we rarely find on draft because places are always out) I ordered a drink with Vodka, Elderflower Liqour, Honey and Guajillo pepper oil. It was delicious. (I had two, which wasn&#39;t cheap, but Oh Well! : P)

The waiter was nice enough but throughout the meal he was barley present.Just thought I&#39;d mention that. It took us a while to get everything and not that they weren&#39;t busy, but he rarely checked back. He also called me a hipster for taking pictures haha. The service was the reason for me not giving this place 5 stars! 

Okay- service will not deter me from returning because the food is great. As usual we split some appetizers; Niche Burger, Steamed Mussels and Chorizo, pepper, queso fresco flat bread. Everything was wonderful. And, this way we kept the price down. I would recommend all three. 

Unsure if I was still hungry, I looked at the dessert menu, when I saw them, my favorite dessert despite not being a HUGE dessert person, Cream Puffs.  Cream Puffs- with  Strawberry mouse, white chocolate granache, strussel, macerated strawberries and BASIL. OMG these were amazing let me tell you. If you like strawberries, cream and basil you must try these. 

Good place to go for a special occasion or for a nice evening out! Enjoy!"

Recommend avoiding the pork belly flat bread until they figure out what&#39;s missing... not much flavor (other than dough),

Great beer and wine selection and newly remodeled - sleeker/ more modern atmosphere... Though, they did hang onto the panoramic pasture art that used to be on the back wall... Can you find where they put it?

First...the hostess was just lovely. My boyfriend went to park the car and I chatted with her for about 5 minutes --she was bubbly, sweet and genuinely seemed happy with her job. This is hard to find!

When I arrived, my first thought was that the decor had completely changed since I had last been there...and in my opinion, not for the better. It looks like they changed it to open up additional seating, but I think in doing so, they lost the coziness and the intimacy of the place. Open room, hard lines everywhere and very minimal. Since I had been there before, I complained to my boyfriend about the change, but he seemed to be OK with it. We both agreed that it was hard to hear one another (we were seated in the middle of the restaurant despite a reservation and openings along either wall), mostly due to the loud music.

They have a few gluten free menu items and were also able to modify those dishes to accommodate a dairy intolerance. I wanted the scallops and foie gras, and since I was looking for an entree, they modified the small plate to include three large scallops,  one piece of foie gras on top of potatoes and onions. While I appreciate the modification, I have a couple of gripes. When the entree was brought out, I was not told what the scallops and foie gras were plated with (since it wasn&#39;t on the menu, I didn&#39;t know what it would come with), and the scallops were nearly cold. The foie gras was decent, but not as flavorful as I&#39;m used to.

Our waiter (his name escapes me), was great. He knew the menu, did not seem at all put-out to accommodate our allergies (nor our questions), was attentive, well-spoken and always had a smile on his face.

Perhaps my review is a bit nit-picky, but it stems from my previous experiences here, and unfortunately this most recent visit was not up to par with my past visits. I don&#39;t like the new layout/decoration (the lack of intimacy), I don&#39;t like that we couldn&#39;t converse easily due to the noise and I don&#39;t like that my food was cold. My boyfriend also commented on the food portions (he had the pork shoulder) --quite small.

Oh, one more thing: their beer menu is ridiculously good, if you&#39;re into that.

For the price, there are other places out this way that are better and I probably won&#39;t dine here again. Not to say that the food is bad, because it&#39;s not...there is just better out there for the price."

When I made the reservations, I let them know it was for this occasion.  We were pleasantly surprised with complementary champagne to toast the night.  Our server Jeffrey was wonderfully attentive to all of our questions and dealt well with our boisterous group.  

We started with the meat and cheese platter which probably was not enough for 8- but everything on it was very good. A few of us had the soup- a wonderful butternut squash- and salad.  

After that it was a VERY long wait for our entrees.  I would have rated this 5 stars if it were not for the generally slow service.  With that said, everyone enjoyed their entrees.  Special mention goes to the brussels sprouts (which even my non-veggie-eating husband enjoyed) and the venison.  

Dessert started with wonderful columns of cotton candy.  This was a definitely a crowd pleaser.  We ordered a small dessert sampler as well which they adorned with candles for the birthday- much appreciated!  And they gave us bags of cotton candy to take home!

We had 7:30 reservations and they did run out of one entree and one dessert.  On a Saturday night it may be a better idea to dine earlier.   Also note that their bar is not very large.  We had planned to have drinks there before dinner, but decide to go elsewhere since there was not room for our group.

The restaurant was noisy so it was difficult to hear conversation from the other end of the long table they put us at.  It would be great if they had rounds for big groups!

Overall, we would dine there again and probably ask for Jeffrey!"

The gnocchi appetizer was great and the drink and wine selection was respectable. However, the new choices on the menu were an overall disappointment. 
The ahi tuna was overlooked and had a poor texture and the cavatelli was awful. The description of smoky flavor is better described as pork and beams sauce  over noddles.

The atmosphere is enjoyable and there is a great space to unwind after a meal, stay for a cup of coffee and dessert if you have room! They really do work hard to make you feel special if you let them know ahead of time what the occasion is! Highly recommend!"

But only if you want to rub elbows with strangers while paying $228 for two of us who had a single appeetizer and dinner. Who serves duck on a cold salad and calls that a entree...with cold potatoes, what is this the depression? Seriously. Was everything tasty, yes but when you charge $16 for an oversized glass of wine that you put 4 sips in do you really want me to not be annoyed? Again all the while we were 2 feet away from people on both sides, I mean...you get your own table at McDonald&#39;s if you spend  $1!!!! For these prices you shoukd be so pompus to herd us in like cattle...To be fair there are tables but we got sat in their bench section although had reservations like everyone else... $15 for 2 scallops..2! Really where are we, Vegas? Or downtown? The scallops were even confused between the 2 different sauces, relish and crunchy pieces of who knows what....that was on it. Way too much,  just serve the damn scallops as is... I&#39;m not happy to write this as I had very high hopes and again the Pork and Duck were delicious, just the duck not the cold salad and potato it was served on.  Huge drink menu and great cocktail selection just bring your life savings for an underwhelming experience."

We got there early and were able to be seated right away which was wonderful.  The restaurant is very pretty and very romantic.  There were a few times while we were there I noticed the music was a little different from the romantic feel, it was more to their bar feel which actually was nice.  It didnt feel stuffy or snooty it felt younger.  
Our waiter was Jeffrey and he was out of this world with his knowledge and attentiveness.  I was torn several times, and he was able to give me perfect descriptions of each dish I asked about so I could made my decision.  
We started off with the pretzel twist appetizer.  They came out hot and fresh, actually so hot they were hard to handle for a second!  They have a side of chive butter topped with sea salt and a side of caramelized onion bacon jam.  The chive butter was outstanding.  The jam was pretty sweet and not quite my taste but it did have a very good flavor to it.  
My husband chose the lamb shank and I finally ended up choosing the Amish chicken.  Both were very good.  My only &#34;complaint&#34; was I prefer less meat more veggies and my plate was almost all chicken.  Mine came with green onions, pickled corn, and roasted quinoa that I really enjoyed.  The chicken was done perfectly and had a very good smokey flavoring to it.
My husbands lamb was also very good.  It was served with small potatoes and asparagus.  His main complaint was, like mine, the lacking veggie sides.  His came with 5 asparagus spears.  
All in all the presentation was beautiful, Jeffrey is fantastic, the food was good and we will go back."

This is the best beer bar that isn&#39;t in the City.  The bottle and tap list is an ever changing lineup of rare and hard to find beers and Vinny (the restaurant/bar manager) is a sommelier by training, but is a beer geek at heart.  The recently remodeled restaurant now features about 10 taps, all of which have beers that could easily anchor a beer release party at any other bar. Their beer selection ranges from your typical Pales and Lagers to Barrel Aged Stouts, IPAs, Sours, and a full lineup of Pipeworks and Three Floyds beers.  It&#39;s not uncommon to stumble on a beer that people skip work and wait in line for at Niche.

Also, every Wednesday Niche hosts a beer bottleshare where you can bring your own bottle or two of craft beer to share with the group.  There is usually 5-10 people there that all know their stuff when it comes to beer and are more than happy to share both beer and good conversation.  If you don&#39;t have anything crazy or rare to share, don&#39;t worry, because most of their Bombers (22oz bottles)and taps are half off on Wednesdays. 

Niche is easily my favorite place in Geneva."

An hour from Chicago via Metra&#39;s Pacific West line, Niche is more than worth the trek.

Their cocktails are exquisite, namely the House Old Fashioned with delicious bourbon soaked cherries. 

Gluten-free menu items are clearly pointed out on the menu and the chef is very well-educated and absolutely respectful of customers with dietary restrictions and doesn&#39;t look down upon customers who suffer from the painful and virus-resistant autoimmune disease. They also offer warm, delicious gluten-free buns, fresh from the oven! 

Every experience I&#39;ve had there has been wonderful. Their farm fresh ingredients are incredible and they have the most amazing cuts of meat in existence. 

Be sure to try the Niche coffee and whatever dessert items they offer!"

The atmosphere was great, the staff was very courteous and we felt at home since we stepped in.  Thuvi, our waitress, was superb. We were treated to champaign glasses to start with, because of our special occasion. 

For appetizers we had the scallops and the house made pretzels. Both absolutely divine. Then, on the house, we had the mussels, on a sauce with beans and a house made sausage. Perfect. 

My girlfriend had the half boneless duck. It was delicious, juicy and full of flavor with layered sweet potatoes and goat cheese. 
I had grilled Barramundi. It was delicious. Flaky, flavorful and the warm lentil salad was the perfect match for the fish. 

Then we ended the night with apple fritter with brown sugar ice cream. So decadent and so delicious.

The menu currently has rabbit (which I had), lamb, ahi tuna (both of which others had), etc. I had steak tartar for an appetizer and loved it.

Niche sets the tone for fine dining in Geneva...and perhaps the tri cities. It just works. From the moment you walk in and are greeted, to the end of the meal, the service is quiet, helpful, professional, warm, and discreet. The consistency of service, presentation, taste, wine and wine recommendations, etc. is perfect and one that other restaurants should strive for.

Why 4 stars and not 5? There seemed to be some sort of issue with the music that night. At times it was quiet, at a few points it suddenly got louder...loud enough that the table became aware of it and everyone started raising their voices to be heard. Leave the louder music to Even Flow (next door), and keep the ambiance you&#39;ve had for so long.

I highly recommend Niche."

Either way, it&#39;s swanky. It&#39;s elegant. It&#39;s gorgeous. Decorated in a modern, yet classic style with sleek lines, traditional prints, and an abundance of dark woods. Niche sets the perfect stage for a sexy date night.

The food itself was delicious. Fresh and local veggies from Bull Run farm, fresh meats and seafood, and vast selection of artisan cheeses &amp; meats - contemporary American done right. You have the option of selecting from their main menu or their smaller menu which features a variety of small plates. We were celebrating our anniversary so we opted to order from both. 

Watermelon Salad // See uploaded picture. I can&#39;t quite describe the dish and it was nothing what I expected. It was a thinly sliced, perfectly cut rectangle of watermelon soaked in vinegar with a couple holes cut out and replaced with pineapple, basil and avocado. It wasn&#39;t bad, but it&#39;s not the first item I recommend.

Burrata and Apricot Salad // Get it. Don&#39;t think twice. 

Grilled Ono with Dill Spaetzle // For a girl who vomits at the thought of seafood, I gave the Ono a try and actually liked it. That said, it comes highly recommended. The dill spaetzle - addictive. 

Bull Run Tart // Meh. Mixed emotions. For a vegetarian dish it was good. I wasn&#39;t crazy about it. The spaghetti squash was drenched in butter, which I could have done without.

Mango Bomba // Amazing. Blackberry tapioca? Don&#39;t knock it &#39;til you try it. 

Trio of Arancini // These tasty morsels are on the small plates menu. If you get anything, get these. They&#39;re quite filling, full of flavor, and the best damn arancini I&#39;ve yet to eat.

The service was professional, prompt, and knowledgeable. However, when I asked to have my overly buttery spaghetti squash replaced with some steamed spinach I saw a lovely $5 charge on the bill. That wasn&#39;t cool. But, our dessert came free of charge so I suppose it all worked out. No hard feelings.

Elegant. Sexy. Fresh. Niche delivered on great food, good service, and a romantic setting that made for the perfect date night."

My experience was not very good.  Two of us walked in without reservations. We were promptly greeted but were told that there were no tables available.  There were clearly four or five tables available in the bar area.  I asked about those tables and if they served dinner there.  We were told &#34;yes&#34;.  This was a bit awkward.  We were seated, given the menus and asked if we would like to order a drink.  We hadn&#39;t picked up the drink menu yet and then were asked three more times in five minutes if we would like to order drinks.  I felt very rushed.  

Once we ordered drinks, two glasses of Prosseco, we were immediately asked if we would like to order food--again, rushed. 

I asked about their three course chef&#39;s choice and the waitress had no clue.  She went to the kitchen to ask and listed off three things on the menu.  I was a bit disappointed because other places I have been the chef does something a little special other than what is on the menu for at least one of the dishes.

We ordered off the menu and asked for a Cabernet to be served with our food. Our food arrived, and it was very mediocre. We were never brought out the Cabernet we ordered! I had the tuna dish and the other person had the pork dish. We also ordered two sides--a vegetable salad side and the basil and eggplant dish.  Both of the main dishes were very bland and lacked the complexity of flavors I have come to experience in small plate dining.  

We both left food on the plate and hardly touched the sides.  The basil eggplant dish was the best of the bunch but went unfinished.  I rarely ever leave food on the plate by the end of a meal let alone in a small plate dining experience! 

Our plates and Prosecco glasses were cleared and the waitress said, &#34;Oh, I didn&#39;t bring your wine because you didn&#39;t finish your Champaign&#34;   Seriously??? 

We asked to see the dessert menu.  There was a little food that had fallen off the plate on the table in front of us and it was never cleaned.  I asked if we could have a napkin to clean the food off and instead of cleaning it she handed me a napkin to do myself. 

Needless to say, we did not order dessert!

Terrible service and mediocre food.  I was disappointed.

Maybe this was an off night but the service at minimum can easily be improved!"

Most recently, my fiance and I decided to spend his birthday at Niche - he called ahead and asked if they might be able to create a special menu catering toward our specific (and very different) tastes for the celebration. Chef Serena and sommelier Vinny designed a menu that did just that, for which we were very thankful. 

Our meal included a roasted chestnut soup that was thick and rich, and absolutely wonderful, as well as a fois gras torchon that was so delicious my fiance ordered three more. Even I had to admit the fois gras was the very good, and I do not like fois at all. We also had a beautiful pheasant stew that I will not soon forget! Dessert included whiskey cake, stout ice cream and a meringue cigarette that reminded us of a recent Top Chef episode. Overall, it was a very good meal and we were very pleased that the staff helped put it together for us.

That being said, I deduct some points for the fact that the items we were served were all regular menu items - if I were to return to Niche this evening, I could order the exact same items. We were really hoping for another Kohler experience, where the chef and sommelier put together a completely unique menu that had never been served to another guest, nor will it ever be. Considering that our dinner at Kohler included Dom P√©rignon champagne and some of the best wines I&#39;ve ever tasted, all for a significantly lower price than Niche&#39;s birthday dinner, I can&#39;t give Niche five stars (I&#39;ve only given two restaurants five stars, and if you read those reviews, you&#39;ll see why). The meal was very good, but not exactly what we were looking for.

Still, if you&#39;re in the Western suburbs and looking for an outstanding meal - of the same quality as some of the top restaurants in Chicago - Niche is definitely the place to go. The food is mostly stellar, and the service, as I mentioned previously, is top notch. Some of the waitstaff has been at the restaurant since it opened (some even before, as it was owned by another group/called something else), which says something about the way they treat their staff (which I think is, in turn, passed on to the customers as well).

I would not call the decor a mix of urban farmhouse and loft, as another reviewer does - it&#39;s actually a bit dated, with lots of dark woods, dark carpet, and truly awful ceiling tile. Most, if not all, guests dress well, meaning collared shirts and trousers for the men (often jackets as well), and dresses or dress slacks for women.

One thing to note is that the restaurant only serves American wines. Say what you will about California and Oregon, but American wine is limiting and not for everyone&#39;s palate/meal. I wish they would broaden their horizons and offer some foreign wines as well."

Niche has one of the most upscale modern dining rooms in the West Suburbs. The tables are well spaced apart. The chairs are comfortable. The lighting is good. The room is quite without being &#34;dead&#34;. 

The service here is also very professional. 

Let&#39;s talk about the food.

Shrimp and Grits were delicious.

Duck Confit wrapped in Phyllo was excellent and a good option to share (4 pcs)

Whitefish was cooked perfectly.

Hanger Steak got &#34;topped off&#34; with beef jus table-side. Yummy!

I would definitely classify Niche as a fine dining restaurant. Be prepared to spend $75-80 a person with wine, tax, and a 20% tip.

One of the few Chicago-quality restaurants in the dining wasteland of the Tri-Cities.  We&#39;ve never had a bad meal and service is impeccable especially if Jeffrey is your server (ask for him!)

However, a huge disappointment for me is their lack of vegetarian entrees for their special occasion/event menus.  We really wanted to go there for Christmas Eve dinner but for $48 per person they only offer pheasant or beef tenderloin for an entree.  I called and inquired about veggie options and I spoke with the chef who only offered roasted veggies &#34;whatever was on hand&#34; that day.  I certainly don&#39;t want to go there and pay $48 for a mystery veggie entree.

For their Naughty Xmas special event, for $60 a person they only offer elk for the entree.  Again, no accommodation for vegetarians.  If I go to upscale restaurant and pay close to $200 for a special event meal, I don&#39;t want to be told that I will be served whatever veggie options are on hand.  I am not vegan, I DO eat fish and I don&#39;t understand why an upscale restaurant like Niche can not offer a fish option for their special events.

I am a big fan of Niche, but this type of service, especially with so many vegetarians out there now, leaves them and the chef severely lacking.  It is sub-par service for such an upscale restaurant."

First off, let me say that our dining experience was probably different than most nights since Charles Woodson (GB Packers player) was there holding a dinner/wine event.  (We&#39;re Bears fans and we were probably the ONLY Bears fans in the room that night. We were sure to keep quiet :-)  But Mr. Woodson was not the reason we were there anyway ;-)  

I loved the ambiance of the building; very beautiful and romantic setting.  
Hubby had the grilled striploin which he thoroughly enjoyed.  I ordered the veal medallions; fan-tastic!  All of the dishes were beautifully prepared, very detailed presentations, which I appreciated.

Desserts were wonderful, the carrot cake was delicious and the serving size was just enough.

The appetizer was absolutely delicous but the serving size was itsy bitsy!  We ordered the maple leaf duck with polenta.  I&#39;m a huge fan of duck and was super excited to try this appetizer but I had to hold in my laughter when the waiter brought it to our table.  It was so tiny and at first, I thought it was only part of it.  But then I quickly realized noooope, this was it!  It was SO good but literally about 4 bites.  Two for me. Two for hubby.  Nice that it worked out for us to both get some ;-)

Definitely an expensive dining experience but it&#39;s a nice place for a special event like a birthday or anniversary.
Cotton candy at the end was so fun!

**UPDATE
We&#39;ve been to Niche a few times and they no longer end your meal with complimentary cotton candy :-(  It was such a unique and fun touch and has to cost next to nothing to make.  
Also, I wish they offered a bit more with your entree (bread, salad, soup, SOMETHING).  Our last meal there was actually quite disappointing.  Flavor was bland and overall, both dishes we ordered did not leave a positive lasting impression.

The first time I visited Niche was actually during a visit to a fest down the street.  I wasn&#39;t really wearing anything pretty or fancy but stopped in for a glass of wine.  The bartender was awesome!  Super friendly and helpful.  He offered me a really nice wine and was very welcoming. 

I&#39;ve only sat in the bar from here on out.. but would love to actually sit in the dining room one day, however, the bartender won me over!!

The food is super, duper delish!  If you want 5-star food, then you need to go here.  You won&#39;t be disappointed.  The best part is, to me, the food doesn&#39;t even seem that expensive.  I&#39;ve eaten at crap restaurants and spent more money.. and Niche makes me wonder, why did I ever do that?! 

It&#39;s really hard to put my experience into word so I highly recommend you giving this place a try.  If you&#39;re a foodie and love wine, you NEED to.  They have a great wine selection that will pair perfectly with your meal. 

NICHE LOVE!"

On a cold Tuesday night, the restaurant was holding a media evening; several well-known food critics were present. The result was a noticeable dialing up of both service and food quality.

We took advantage of the 5 course chef&#39;s menu with wine pairing. The Shrimp and Grits was an extraordinarily light dish. Grits with creamy and tasty artisinal goat&#39;s cheese, a tomato coulis layered with 4 different spices, including cayenne paprika and tobacco which provided surprising depth.

The pleasant arugula salad was not overpowered by the capers and acted as a palate cleanser.

The Winter Cassoulet was presented as a deconstructed pot pie, the result being an unctuous dish layered with flavor, as opposed to a classic Toulousian dish with big chunks of meat. It was excellent.

Humbolt Fog was pleasantly presented with freshly baked crackers and accompaniments.

The white chocolate cheesecake was so light, and perfectly matched with both a chocolate and berry sauce.

Service was spot on from our enthusiastic, young waitress Liz, who provided just the right balance on conviviality and service. The chef, Serena, walked around and was happy to take questions and explain her sources.

Wine pairings were well chosen, if not &#39;top drawer,&#39; but for $25 a person it was very acceptable, although the pours were just a wee bit short of generous ..

I very rarely give 5 stars, as the meal really has to be both a memorable and faultless experience for me, but Niche earned it, and if they can maintain this level of cooking and service it would be both wonderful and hard work. 

I look forward to returning and seeing this standard being maintained"

Vince, the owner/bartender, sets a very welcoming tone in the bar area.  He is very friendly and loves to talk about bourbon, baseball, and music.  A great combination, in my view!  He has all sorts of bourbons and other whiskeys behind the bar, when I ask him to come up with something interesting, he always does.  If you like Manhattans (I do), try his Pappy Van Winkle Manhattan for a real treat.

Was surprised to see that restaurant was dead and  bartender was not very attentive and said she did not have any margaritas made but would accommodate if she could find all of the  ingredients. Ended of giving me a jalapeno margarita  that wasn&#39;t &#34;out of this world&#34; and charged me $12. Not worth it.

Decor is kind of a mix of urban farmhouse and loft. Low lighting makes for a romantic atmosphere. This is obnoxiously picky, but table settings were a mishmosh of Victorian (green bread plates) and random other styles. At a restaurant with such good food that considers itself to be fine dining, it was almost as if after a remodel they kept a few of their old pieces and didn&#39;t go all the way to replace their china. Music was also an odd choice on a Friday night - mostly 80&#39;s. I guess I just wasn&#39;t expecting to hear Sade while dropping a couple hundred on dinner. :)

All in all though a great experience. We&#39;d definitely go back."

The service was horrible.  We had Jeffrey as our waiter.  Seven people in our party and of those six had never been to Niche, but had wanted to try it.  

We arrived at 7 pm and, despite calling at 5 pm to confirm our number and reservation, the table was not ready.  Evidently, the guy that answers the phone is not the guy who makes sure the tables are set correctly.

We ordered a variety of small plate dishes and desserts about 7:30 pm, but it wasn&#39;t until 9 pm that everyone finally had a dish served to them.  The waiter decided that we should be served in courses, but that meant that three people in our party (almost 50%) were left without anything to eat for two courses.   He told us, not ASKED US, that he was going to serve in courses.  It was his way or the highway.  After too much time between courses, I asked the waiter if he could please just bring out all of the dishes.  Another 30 minutes goes by as he serves everyone else in the restaurant, but us.  

I asked him, &#34;Is the kitchen backed up?&#34;  (Yes, I would have been more understanding if our change in service meant the kitchen was backed up.)  He says &#34;No ma&#39;am.  I explained to YOU how I was going to serve the meal.  You remember that right?&#34;  Yes, he did, but he never ASKED me how our group wanted to be served.  We had 3 people sitting through two courses with nothing to eat.  We had ordered various small plates and desserts.  It was not ordered as a formal meal.  He maybe the waiter, but I am the customer and I do not appreciate attitude or being put in my place when I&#39;m asking on behalf of my group for our food to be delivered sooner than later.

Once the food started coming, people were getting served the wrong food.  Two people were served food three times that they didn&#39;t order and three times they had to repeat what they had ordered to the waiter after telling him &#34;I didn&#39;t order this.&#34;  Doesn&#39;t he write this stuff down???

Then the bills - It took almost an hour from the time one person had requested her bill until the rest of us got ours.

There were other tables that had been seated at the same time as us.  They had been served, finished their meal and paid their bill by the time we were finally able to pay our bills.

20% auto gratuity added to parties of 6 people or more so we as customers had no recourse for bad service.

The fact is seven people went to Niche.  Only one in our party said she would be back.  The rest said they would tell their friends how bad the service was."

I live in the city and took the train out, and can honestly say it was worth the train ride. I was with three friends, so we were able to share and taste quite a bit of the menu. 

I&#39;m not going to go into detail but here were my favorite things: Shrimp &amp; Grits, Arugula Salad, &#34;Shaft&#39;s Aged Bleu&#34; cheese, Lobster Saffron Risotto (so, so good and the perfect serving size so you don&#39;t feel bogged down). All of the desserts were delicious, but my absolute favorite was their tried and true Niche Coffee. If you get a chance, watch them make it... it&#39;s really cool. 

The service was phenomenal, the atmosphere couldn&#39;t have been any better - how often do you get extremely fine dining in a relaxed, comfortable atmosphere. If you&#39;re in the Western Suburbs, be sure to check out Niche. Cheers!"

The food is still the best in the area...fresh, full of flavor, etc...a great innovative chef...
However i visited for the first time since the remodeling...the decor is more informal...the bar is now part of the restaurant...the white table cloths are now replaced with wood top tables..the atmosphere has lost a big part of its elegance. They now tout their beers and beer dinners...I love beer but I would not come here for that...
Jeffrey, probably the best waiter in the chicago area, continues to help make your dining experience notches above the qualitty of the restaurant( it is still a great place to eat).  I am now more interested in visiting here for a quick snack and glass of wine at the bar as opposed to a high end dining experience. I would compare the experience now, to a smaller version of Alexander&#39;s or White Chocolate Factory...go there expecting that and you will have a pleasant and positive dining experience."

I really wanted to like it since it received a good review from a friend of mine.  Overall, I like the concept. They had a pretty good wine selection, but the execution of several dishes was poor. 

I arrived about 10 minutes before the rest of my party and headed to bar for a glass of wine. I had a very nice pinot noir, and the waitress working the bar (the bartender was running late) was great. The general vibe and ambiance of the place was good and I thought I was in for a nice evening.

Once seated, I started with a mushroom tart, which was supposed to be topped with a poached egg, but was closer to hard-boiled. The flavor was good, but the egg was just plain overdone. It was followed by a mediocre salad, and the rib eye. The steak was very fatty and had an okay flavor. It might have been better had it been bone-in. I finished off the meal with some decent gelato and coffee. 

The waiter dripped some hot coffee on my arm and pants. I said something along the lines of &#34;Owe!&#34;, but he just didn&#39;t seem to be paying much attention. This was definitely annoying, but I still might give Niche another shot. Everyone has an off night, I guess."

We arrived early for our 7:30 reservations thinking we would have a drink at the bar, but we were seated right away. The dining room filled up quickly after that. Great ambiance and decor. 
I asked our waitress (who we recognized from her previous job at another of our favorite restaurants) for my special martini (Vodka Negroni with an orange twist) and she came through with flying colors even though it was the first time she or the bartender had heard of it. 
Suffice it to say that our entire meal was wonderful, including the sorbet intermezzo and the surprise at the end. A little on the pricey side for as often as we dine out, but we don&#39;t mind spending a little more if the experience warrants it."

Niche encompasses 80% of what made 302 great (minus 302&#39;s grand atmosphere, that amazing bar, and hostess Catherine).  Otherwise the food, servers, and location were all spot on.  Here is an overview of what we had:

$10-Duck confit nachos: perfect portion of crisp and protein.  This was the most expensive appetizer out of 8 or so.

$8- glass of sparkling wine each for a friend and I, although they do have $500 bottles of wine so this may be where people start racking up their bills.

Free-Mango sorbet intermezzo: perfect palette cleanser

$24-Kalmata olive marinated chicken with egg plant and artichokes over a red pepper sauce.  Very moist and portion was very satisfying.

$27-schezwan beef: huge portion of tender steak in a sweet Asian sauce.  

We both had sides of the garlic mash too, not quite as good as 302&#39;s goat cheese mash but right up there.

Entrees ranged from $16-35, the most expensive being a filet.

$10-Niche coffee:  the exact same as coffee 302  and thank god it is.  Perfect blend of coffee, grand marnier, irish cream, with a cinnamon sugar rim.

$6- creme br√ªl√©e with chocolate chip cookies:  a classic

$8-peanut butter panna cotta with a mini vanilla bean milk shake and warm fresh Italian doughnut holes.  This was the most expensive dessert btw.

So, I don&#39;t usually include prices in reviews, but with all that we got out of there for a little over $100.  They&#39;re really providing top notch food and service and have distinguished themselves as one of the best in the area.  Oh, and the dining room is intimate but you feel very &#34;removed&#34; from busy 3rd street, especially at night with all of the table specific lighting."

First off the service is top notch and this place has the best stocked bar that I have ever seen.  If you enjoy alcohol do yourself a favor and stop by for a hard to find whiskey or beer.  
As for the food my wife ordered the vindaloo beef and I ordered the Atlantic scallops.  The vindaloo beef came with sweet potato hash browns topped with roasted Brussels sprouts and French green beans.  The combination of the sweet, bitter and savory is fantastic. The beef is also top notch.  The vindaloo sauce was described as Niche&#39;s take on an Indian / curry based topping for a perfectly cooked tenderloin.  The scallops were large sea scallops seared to perfection topped with a kind of parmesan cracker over a sweet leek jam accompanied by tart granny smith apples.  I have been dreaming of this dish every night since I have had it.  I am not kidding when I say this is the best scallop dish I have ever had.
At the end of the night we shared the endless cotton candy and the &#34;shot and a beer desert which consists of whiskey cake, barrel-aged porter ice cream and meringue cigarette.  If you like the hints of burnt sugar this is the desert for you.  
To top it all off at the end of dinner the servers delivered each woman in the restaurant a single red rose.  It was a great experience and we will be back soon."

This is not a place to go for dinner. It is a place to go and enjoy an evening of extraordinary tastes and wines with company deserving of such. If your unable to sit for several hours and casually absorb the expertly prepared courses paired with a very unique wine list, then go elsewhere.

It is the absolute best the Tri-cities has to offer. And while not on par with a restaurant such as Chicago&#39;s Tru, it also doesn&#39;t require cashing in your children&#39;s college fund.

A couples night out: a couple bottles of wine (white for my bride, red for me), cheese plate, appetizers followed by a shared soup (combined table side), salad, main course and desert, typically averages $250 to $300. And is worth every penny. Less splurging can cut the tab by half; I just don&#39;t have that level of self control.

The wine list is not large, but has a very unique diversity of styles, regions, and vineyards. A bit midscale in price with bottles starting around $40; it has some excellent selections. 

A bit of sherbet cleanses the palate, and Niche&#39;s cotton candy brought at meals end is the perfect primer for desert.

If you have never been, pick the date, call ahead for reservations, and enjoy."

I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to dock them for cost since I knew it would be a pricey meal going in.  Same goes for the &#34;fancy factor.&#34;  This is an elegant restaurant.  Expect your fellow diners to be dressed elegantly.  Make a reservation.  If there are none available, they&#39;ll call you if something opens up.  

That said, the service at Niche is unparalleled, especially for suburban dining.  My fiance and I have been there twice, and both times we were the youngest people in the room by at least 15 years.  Some fancy places snub the younger crowd but not Niche.  The hostesses treated us like royalty and let us select our table.  Our waitress, Kathy, spent extra time chatting with us about the menu and wines as well as our engagement.  Chef Jeremy even came out to say hello and how great it was to see young people who love food in his restaurant.  On our first visit we received a delicious creme broulee on the house and for the second trip we were given free champagne and cotton candy, spun in house!  How fun!  

I highly recommend the clam chowder.  It&#39;s the best I&#39;ve ever had.  The bosc pear salad is refreshing and crisp.  Their duck is flavorful without being too fatty.  The fingerling potatoes are a fun twist on the typical potato side dish.  For dessert I love the cheesecake with fresh berries.  The chocolate espresso truffle cake is decadent and just the right size.  The cappuccino and biscotti is great if you&#39;re on the full side.  You can&#39;t go wrong with the desserts at Niche.

This is the perfect place if you&#39;re celebrating something because they really do make you feel special.  Cozy, friendly, romantic and worth the expense for sure."

Regardless, I&#39;m glad the place is here and we had a chance to go.

We went there on Mardis Gras after seeing a promotion for their Fat Tuesday Feast Winter Tasting Menu. This being a minor holiday for most but big for foodies, we expected a crowd, and there was none. In fact, there were only two other tables occupied during the 2 hours we were there, which makes me fear for the future of the place. Maybe it&#39;s just the Tuesday night factor.

Everything we ate was thoughtfully prepared, from fine ingredients, and tasted fantastic. We started with the best pork belly I&#39;d ever eaten, went on to lobster fritters, fried oyster on brioche with crawfish √©touff√©e, strawberry sorbet intermezzo, chicken sausage jambalaya, and a perfect pecan tart. Our server, Jeffrey, was attentive, pleasant helpful, and warm, and didn&#39;t bat an eye at several &#34;information requests&#34; that we made. Realizing that we were there on a slow night, I nevertheless couldn&#39;t imagine a more pleasant atmosphere.

The wine list is intimidating and we copped out to a special offering associated with the current tasting menu. I&#39;m not a huge wine person, but I recognized very few of the offerings, most of which where in the $50-$100 range, or beyond. We didn&#39;t ask for suggestions, but I don&#39;t doubt that we would have gotten good advice if we had.

I suspect the place is very forgiving with respect to dress and protocol. I would be comfortable there in anything from jeans and a nice shirt, to a suit and tie, and there was no hint of pretense or snobbery from any of the staff. Thy have coat check service for those so inclined, or just hang your coat on the back of your chair.

We intend to put this long overlooked venue into our rotation, and are looking forward to our next excuse to go there (St. Pat&#39;s special sounds intriguing!)."

Our soup was cold, it was supposed to be warm/hot but was not, regardless not too bad. The complimentary bread was yummy. I got the scallops but my meal was lacking any real flavor. Again not bad but nothing that wowed me. Husbands steak was ok. Had the flour less choc tarte for desert, not bad for flour less but tasted more liked a shaped mousse.

The creative flavor combinations, care in preparation, locally sourced ingredients, and eye on detail is what really makes this place stand out.    The decor is unique, the bartenders know how to make a decent drink, and the &#34;All American&#34; wine list (except for the French champagne) is quite extensive.

We were there pretty late and Chef Jeremy came out to our table to check in.  Specifically, he wanted to see in which order I tried the dipping sauces for the coconut frog legs.  We asked him about the use of honey in salad dressing and he went into a story about how he has purchased (or &#34;beeshared&#34; for lack of a better term) beehives from a local apiarist.  Now he can get honey and honeycomb as much as he&#39;d like.

It was my husband&#39;s 30th birthday and the bar manager was so accommodating to our requests to have bourbon flight tastings with some small plates.  One of the best birthday nights out.  My husband had such a great time trying out different types of bourbon and picking his brain about the differences in each.

Since our last visit, the chef has changed and the decor has been updated. First the positive - the updated decor is very nice, I would say casually elegant.  Now the les than positive observations.  Let me start by saying that our last rating was 5 stars and quite honestly this was the best restaurant in the western suburbs, in my opinion. After tonight, the rating is 3 stars.  Niche has taken a step back, in my opinion, to appeal to a wider variety of clientele.  Whereas before I would classify a niche as fine dining, I would say it is definitely casual, albeit on the nicer end of casual.  The new chef is clearly trying to out his stamp on the menu and while the selections were diverse and appealing,the quality was not the same as it used to be with previous chefs. I had the lamb chops and for $32 was disappointed at receiving only two relatively small chops.  It looked more like an appetizer.  There was not much flavor and the meat was quite tough.  My wife had chicken which appeared to be a rather low quality boneless cutlet with not much flavor.  There are no more pre dinner bread selections and the cold fruit soup du jour was uninspiring. I would say that Niche can now be considered an average restaurant, but unfortunately I was looking for fine dining.  I am not anxious to return."

The sushi quality was ok. However, it felt like my sushi rolls were prepared much earlier to my arrival as the rice was refrigerator cold. Also, there was much more rice than sushi in my rolls. 

When I asked for the low sodium soy sauce, the waitress told me that it was already on my table. However, it was NOT low sodium.

It&#39;s a nice atmosphere with friendly staff. But I personally prefer the city locations much better. Don&#39;t really have a desire to come back again. I give it 2.5 stars. There are much better sushi spots in the area."

First off, the staff was incredibly rude, even right off the bat. My mom, dad and I came for AYCE sushi, but we told them my younger brother was going to order a separate dish for himself (since he&#39;s picky and doesn&#39;t do raw fish). Immediately, our waitress emphasized that he was NOT to eat off any of our plates, including any appetizers we ordered from the AYCE menu. I noticed she kept coming over every few minutes to &#34;check up on us&#34; (but really, to stare down my brother and make sure he wasn&#39;t touching any of our food). Talk about unnecessary paranoia/rudeness to really turn off your customers.

Secondly, the sushi wasn&#39;t fresh, nor was it rolled well. Almost every piece I picked up with my chopsticks fell apart, and in terms of taste and presentation, none of the rolls I ordered blew me out of the water. Additionally, a lot of the fried appetizers were beyond oily (I mean they were BATHING in pools of oil). 

Thirdly, THEY CHARGE FOR HOT SAUCE. Have you ever been to any sushi place that charges for sauce?? Because I haven&#39;t (nor should I ever expect to be charged for sauce). Needless to say, this surprised and displeased us all. 

To top it all off, they charged us an extra $12 for being unable to polish off our plates. Beware: even leaving a bit of rice will cost you. I&#39;d always heard about these policies at other AYCE sushi places, but this was the first time I had ever actually been penalized for not stuffing myself into a food coma. Blasphemous.

That&#39;s not it, however. As we were leaving, we expressed our unhappiness with regards to all of the above, and the staff responded extremely rudely: &#34;so what?? Thanks for your opinion.&#34; Never in my life had I had my whole family spoken to so rudely! We made it clear that we would never return.

All in all, a bad bad bad experience. Avoid this place like the bubonic plague."

There was a large hanging hair on my food. The manager took it back and made me a different plate and I received a 10% discount. Seriously!! At least my meal should have been taken of the tab. 

I like the Sushi para in Lincoln park and palatine but this one is a complete joke. I literally filled my pockets with rice because the amount of rice on the nigiri was a complete joke. Yes, it&#39;s all you can eat and yes you get what you paid for but I didn&#39;t order a side of white rice to go. 

You can&#39;t complain about the quality and sloppiness because your paying $19.99 for sushi. I&#39;m aware of the level and my expectations were low from the beginning. But come one !!!! This was a joke I felt like I was getting punked. 

The table next to us was doing the same thing. The male in that table kept going out to his car to deposit handfuls of rice. 

The one in lincoln park and Palatine give you a cut of fish you can taste. The cuts here were a joke it was like a ban aid around a watermelon. Then you have the &#34;Gustapo&#34; Asian manager walking around giving people the dirty eye. It was like a cat and mouse game it actually was a big joke. 

The male next to us kept going to his car. On one occasion his jacket was full of rice it was so funny. I feel his pain you spend your hard earned money on dinner you want to make sure at least you can enjoy the meal. I came out with a North Face full of rice the manger was just dyeing to find out how the hell I kept eating so much nigiri LOL 

Never again!!!! The entire meal was ruined but I got a good laugh.......

There is another all you can eat sushi spot down the street. They were both 3 1/2 stars so it was coin flip for me. I like the other Para&#39;s when my finances are low and I want cheap sushi they meet my needs. But this place is a tragic comedy. I got a hair on my &#34;White Rice&#34; nigiri, they should have just given me a bag of rice and told me to leave."

Then that same ordering check off list on the same sheet of paper was on the table as we were seated.  That&#39;s when I knew that the food would at least be decent...and it was just that.

It&#39;s an all you can eat sushi buffet...when you&#39;re in one of these places, you usually have to take it in with a grain of salt - it&#39;s not going to be the best quality fish out there.  That&#39;s exactly how I felt today.  We ordered a variety of nigiri - tuna, salmon, white tuna, red snapper, yellow tail, and mackerel.  All were average - I&#39;ve had much better, but I&#39;ve also had worse.  All pieces had a ton of rice.  Very sneaky...that&#39;s how these all you can eat sushi places make you full!!  

We also ordered some of the other apps - edamame (over steamed/boiled to the point where some were pretty mushy), miso soup (fairly bland), seaweed salad, chicken yakitori, and the grilled squid (unfortunately the official name for it escapes me, but that was the best part of the meal).  We also ordered 2 rolls - alaska and volcano.  I definitely give them credit for doing a good job with their rolls.  Not over-riced, nor was the rice itself mushy, and the flavor was good.  

I would definitely return to this place for when I&#39;m starving and in the mood for sushi rolls in particular...however, if I want the best quality sushi/sashimi, I may end up going elsewhere."

Stopped in for the first time recently and checked out the Pork Belly Buns and Shoyu Ramen (both pictured).  The buns were melt-in-your-mouth goodness. A little fatty, but the combination of pork, peanut sauce, lettuce (crunch!) all packed into a steamed Chinese bun...stellar. The Pork Shoyu Ramen was much the same. Fantastic broth, proper ramen noodles, soft boiled egg, and two servings of some healthy grilled pork were all I needed for a full belly and a smile on my face. Fair prices and friendly service were abound, but the strip-mall feel and odd choice in background music were enough to hold me back from the ultimate five. I&#39;ll be back without hesitation! 

P.S. They also featured an AYCE soup/sushi lunch menu for $14.99....very tempting!"

Broth was ok, though it was not wonderful, but the noodles used in it seems a lower quality than other typical Ramen restaurants use.  I can make a better quality Ramen at home with noodles purchased in a grocery store.  Sad to say but Ramen here is not worth to pay.

That place was empty when we got there so it looks like they do not have a lot of customers for a reason. We ordered from the &#34;All You can eat&#34; menu (didn&#39;t have a lot of variety) After we were done with choosing sushi, the waitress came back to our table TWICE asking if we are sure we can eat all of that (about 16 pieces each) She came back with another worker to literally ask for an explanation of why we are ordering &#34;so much&#34; pieces of sushi. They did not put enough utensils and I just had to grab an extra plate + napkin from the table next to ours. They noticed that right away and quickly went to put another plate and napkin on that table but did not notice that I did not have one in first place. They made it look like it was such a big deal taking a plate from another table.  They did not even bring everything we ordered from the appetizers. We wanted to leave as soon as possible so we wanted the check. Right before we paid, one of the waitresses started cleaning up the table while holding the check so we just had to wait until she finished. Why would you do that? You clean up after the customers leave. 
The whole experience there was awful. I don&#39;t know what these people expect - customers coming back??!! Unprofessional, rude, do not know how to deal with customers at all. At the end, I did not know who our waitress was because one - brought the sushi, the other - the check, the third - asking why we are ordering so many pieces.

Pleasant staff (though only giving 4/5 stars because they don&#39;t often check in on you once the food arrives). For appetizers the gyoza (meat and veg pan fried dumplings are quite tasty). My daughter and husband prefer the steamed buns, served open faced with delicious pork belly, pickled ginger, lettuce and a mildly spicy bright orange sauce.

I am a huge sushi lover and have tried many places and Para has yet to let me down. They have a great deal for carry out dinner-3 rolls, 2 pieces nigiri, and an appetizer for only $17, always fills me up. My favorite thing about Para is their spicy mayo, it has a different flavor to it (garlic maybe?) that gives it more depth than I&#39;m used to, I&#39;m obsessed with that sauce. I highly recommend the angel roll, Michigan roll, and volcano roll. Definitely worth a try for any sushi lover in the area!"

Pleasant waitstaff and food was fairly prompt. Prices are actually pretty good if you eat a medium amount of sushi or more.

I&#39;m really surprised to see all the negative reviews and that hasn&#39;t been my experience nor that of my friends who have turned me on to this place. I live in Naperville and have been to a few all you can eat sushi&#39;s where they play games like taking a really long time to make your food so you&#39;ll not eat much, etc... When ever I go to eat sushi with my family, we usually come out with a bill well north of $100. When we go to Para, I&#39;ll come away with a bill for half that much and actually eat more, what a bargain! The other reviewers are right in that this place never seems very busy. I hope they stay in business."

Don&#39;t get me wrong, the sushi is by no means terrible here; it&#39;s just that when I eat AYCE sushi, I often compare it to the quality of Hokkai Sushi in Glen Ellyn (probably the best AYCE sushi restaurant in Illinois as of right now).

All of the sushi had a weird sweet taste to it, maybe the rice? Can&#39;t say for sure. The fish didn&#39;t taste 100% either. 
The waiter never once came by to see how things were- not when we were waiting or when we had the food.

Sushi Para recently took over this space from Hokkai Japanese. $16 for lunch and $20 for dinner. I think they&#39;re making a great effort towards preparing their food with care so that customers will want to return. You&#39;re greeted warmly upon entering, and the service is friendly and attentive throughout your visit. The booths and tables are nicer than several of the other Sushi Para locations I&#39;ve been to. The all you can eat menu is large and contains appetizers, nigiri, simple maki, and specialty rolls. I like to start with the fried scallops and sweet potato tempura. The fried appetizers, shrimp tempura, and tempura crisps used in some of the rolls taste freshly fried. At some Sushi Para locations, the shrimp tempura and tempura crisps often taste like they were fried an hour ago. Not so here. The nigiri are better than what&#39;d you get in a grocery store but not much different than the other Sushi Para locations. However, I find the rolls are superior at this particular location; they are better constructed (not too much rice and you don&#39;t have to worry about rolls breaking apart when you pick them up with your chopsticks). The final benefit of choosing this location over the ones in Chicago is free parking. This has become my go to spot for when I&#39;m in the mood for all you can eat sushi. Recommend!"

Won&#39;t ever be going back there. EVER!

Saturday afternoon, 1 pm for lunch. As soon as we walk in, literally two feet from the door, we are asked &#34;How many?&#34;. We explained it was our very first time here... we thought it was still Hokkai... but now it&#39;s Para. I walked up to the hostess stand (which is basically the sushi bar, too) and asked to see a menu as it was our very first time here. (Note to all restauranteurs - THAT&#39;S especially when you want to be at your best, so people like us come back after their &#34;very first visit&#34;!)

It should be noted that at this time of day, on a Saturday at around 1pm, there was only one table eating; a couple with two very young children.

You would think they would have actually wanted our business on such a slow day where employees outnumbered the guests.

I was immediately handed a &#34;To Go&#34; menu. I could not read it because the print was so small, and we were &#34;wanting&#34; to dine there, so I asked for a &#34;real&#34; menu. I was handed one, albeit what seemed as a bit reluctantly.)

I was given the &#34;dinner&#34; menu (a 1:05pm!) which had the ACYE (All You Can Eat) sushi deal for $19.95, not $15.95 as is their regular lunch price for lunch. I mentioned it and was handed a lunch menu, along with some attitude.

My wife and I decided to try it, and sat down. 

We asked for sake, and was told they could no longer sell liquor because their liquor license &#34;expired&#34;.  OK, first bad sign that that they either PLAN on going out of business or are incompetently managed.

I asked for the AYCE (All You Can Eat) sushi off their lunch menu, and was told I could not have it... I could ONLY have their All You Can Eat off their &#34;dinner menu&#34; at 20% more money for the exact same food  - at one o&#39;clock in the afternoon! 
OK, second bad sign!

I asked if tea came with the ACYE sushi, and was told NO, that will cost extra. OK, third bad sign, but not totally unreasonable.

Again, you would think with only ONE table at their Saturday lunch service, they would be more accommodating, or even more personable to help ensure our return. I guess not.

Then we read on their All You Can Eat Menu... 

IMPORTANT TO NOTE THIS: You are CHARGED FOR ANY LEFTOVER RICE ON YOUR PLATE, AS WELL AS SUSHI you don&#39;t finish. Yes, YOU ARE CHARGED FOR RICE LEFT ON YOUR PLATE!!!

What?!!!  Do they charge per grain of rice? What constitutes &#34;leftover sushi rice&#34;? 

Everything about this place screams of another sushi house DESTINED TO CLOSE FOR LACK OF BUSINESS.

We left, drove only about 2 minutes east and ate at Aodake Sushi and Steak near Home Depot on 75th, We&#39;ve eaten at the one in Romeoville quite often, and it&#39;s always been stellar in terms of BOTH, food and service.

The Aodake on 75th in Darien was no different. Perfect service. Perfect food. We felt like valued customers. That&#39;s why Aodake has recently opened their 3rd location-in Chicago. We ate and ate, drank a few sake and could not have been more pleased when all was said and done, that Para was so bad we left. We had a great meal at their competitor and were quite pleased.

SAVE YOUR MONEY AND AGGRAVATION you&#39;ll no doubt receive from Para, this &#34;chain&#34; sushi house that offers nothing but attitudes, bait and switch menus, and worse, NO INDICATION OF EVEN WANTING TO TRY TO PLEASE THEIR &#34;NEW&#34; CUSTOMERS .

(The hospitality industry, which both my wife and I were in for many years as a restaurant managers, calls customers &#34;guests&#34;, based on wanting to treat them with the same &#34;hospitality&#34; as if they were in your own home. 
Not at Para. 
Not at all!)

SKIP THIS TERRIBLE PLACE and go to any one of MANY SUSHI RESTAURANTS IN THE AREA. My guess is that Para will be closed before you get there, anyways."

We will never be returning here due to the following issues we had on our visit. 
1. When we walked in we were not given any menus nor any kind of idea of if we were even going to get a server
2. We sat there and waited and waited and waited.... no one came to ask us what we wanted to drink, to give us menus or anything. 
3. I was missing utensils on my side of the table, not to mention it was kind of dirty.
4. Before we even ordered, one of the girls tried to give us food that didn&#39;t belong to us. It was given to the man behind my girlfriend there after.
5. We finally were asked if we ordered and my girlfriend stated we didn&#39;t even have menus yet. We got the menus.
6. Several minutes pass after we put our menus down and waited to order. No eye contact was given from the waitress. She wasn&#39;t even the one to take our order, another male waiter came to ask, didn&#39;t write anything down.
7. Moments after we order another incorrect dish is delivered to our table. It sits there in front of us. We have to flag down a server to tell them it&#39;s not ours. It is then delivered AGAIN to the man behind my girlfriend.
8. The first part of the order comes out, it was sushi, it was wrong. My girlfriend specifically asked and made sure the man heard it clearly. He says he&#39;ll get it to her at no charge at least.
The food quality was great, the food was crafted well, hot and tasty. The service was horrible and probably the worst dining experience I&#39;ve ever had. Not only were we upset by the wrong food deliveries but we heard the same from others around us. In the time we had been there for the first 15 minutes, there were at the very least 4 wrong food orders brought out to the wrong tables. No attempt was made by the staff to right their wrongs. There was no sincerity either. As a person who works in the food and service industry, I know for a fact that this is NOT acceptable. We will never return here. It&#39;s a real shame too since the food was so good.

EDIT: an extra tid-bit, I got sick later on in the night."

Their lunch menu is pretty decent as well.  (If you&#39;re looking to do dinner here, make it early, since their hours are 5am-4pm.)  Located in the old IHOP, they did a great job remodeling the interior, to give it a family restaurant appeal with a bit of a classy vibe.

Service here has always been stellar.  From being the first customers on a weekday morning or in the middle of a post-church Sunday rush, service is always spot-on.

For breakfast, crepes, omelettes, or giant frittatas are great choices, but the menu is large enough to hold something for everyone. (Yes husband, I even mean you!) Portions are huge, so I usually walk out with a to-go container.  For lunch, I definitely recommend starting out with one of their 3 or 4 soup selections.  My personal favorite is the lemon rice.  A creamy chicken base with rice and a hint of lemon.  My favorite comfort food option!"

I had the Sophia Fritatta and my husband had the veggie skillet.  The Fritatta was HUGE, enough for at least 3 people and it was delicious!  The only complaint with our food was it lacked any seasoning, salt and pepper. Better not salted rather than too salty though. 

Overall I think this place was great. Service was great , we were seated promptly and food portions were more than enough and the price is right. We will probably return again and I recommend you give this place a try.

My server was from their Orland Park restaurant, lives in IN and didn&#39;t seem to want to spend more than 7 seconds at a time at my table. I felt rushed and had to beg for a carafe of water.

The skillet arrived eerily quick. My poached soft eggs were cooked medium and there was a large chunk of burnt cheddar cheese, a half a piece of raw bacon, along with some nearly raw potatoes in the skillet. My first two bites were nothing but crunchy bacon and only 5 slices of mushroom? Half of my skillet was just potatoes and by the time I ate the overcooked eggs and stirred it all around, I lost my appetite. The toast was barely toasted and was eerily buttered with a yellow spread that I question if it was margarine. 

I tend to eat half my skillet and take the other half home to enjoy another day, but there was no way this was going to be enjoyable another day. When I brought this all to the owners attention, he asked if it was sent back. With what I saw, they still should be looking for a cook. He offered to give me 50% off... so six bucks for some over cooked eggs and coffee? I won&#39;t be coming back."

After finding an ad (Clipper Magazine) for this place I figured ok let&#39;s give it a go this past Friday 7/15. My husband, 2 young daughter&#39;s and my teenage daughter and I arrive around 11:45 and it&#39;s pretty empty...3 tables. After being seated we waited 5 minutes until a man comes by and plops down water and walks away. I&#39;m looking at the menu....a hair stuck onto a grease covered page...yuck. Another 5 minutes go by until our waitress comes to ask if wanted anything to drink. I order coffee. I get warm not hot coffee....ok whatever. She leaves....almost 10 minutes later she finally comes back. I&#39;m getting annoyed at this point....I ask about the Free Mickey Mouse pancakes advertised for kids....she gives me a weird look and says I never heard of that. I pull out the ad and show it to her....ohhh it&#39;s a coupon she says. Nooo it&#39;s not listed as a coupon I say. Then she brings the hostess who tells me it&#39;s a coupon and that in order to receive the free pancakes we have to purchase 2 adult entrees. I&#39;m sorry.....where in your ad does it say 1) that it&#39;s a coupon and 2) that you must purchase an adult entree? Ok fine I say....so then that includes the kid drink like all of your kid&#39;s meals. Their response...no the drinks are on you.  I ask if they can include the 2 kids drinks given their misleading advertisement since I can&#39;t use another coupon. They go show the ad to the owner and presumably go get her....well the waitress comes back to tell me &#34;ummm yeah, the owner says you can only get the pancakes with the purchase of 2 entrees and the drinks are on you&#34;. I tell her to tell the manager that when it comes to advertising you need to be clear and not mislead people only for them to come in and then you tell them ohhh well what we mean by this is this not that. What the hell?? My husband and I are beyond aggravated with the extremely poor service ALL around but we&#39;re starving at this point so I say fine....live and learn...1st and last time we come to this place. I then tell the waitress we&#39;ll  just go ahead and order. She has the nerve to tell me &#34;No, I have to go put in an order and take care of other customers since I wasted so much time trying to figure this out.&#34; Did you really just say that???? I&#39;m sorry you, the owner,  and hostess couldn&#39;t figure out your advertising mistake....I&#39;m sorry you have NOOOO idea how to advertise clearly, address issues, and your customers more importantly ...and 1st time customers as a matter of fact. Great 1st impression (let me clarify this is sarcasm). Needless to say we immediately got up to leave. The owner was by the register talking to the hostess sees us coming and she rapidly walks away. Wow...I thought. We paid for the coffee and left. This &#34;issue&#34; could&#39;ve EASILY been resolved and maybe gained us as regular customers assuming the food is better than the service and cleanliness. The owner has no common business sense if you ask me. Don&#39;t waste your money or time with this place.  YOU WANT A GREAT BREAKFAST ALL AROUND...FROM CLEANLINESS, SERVICE TO EXCEPTIONAL FOOD GO TO SOUTHERN BELL IN CREST HILL!!!!!"

How was the service?  Was the food tasty?  How was the presentation?  Were the servers overworked or did they just have a bad attitude?  And if I go in for breakfast, how were the hash browns?  Because hash browns are so simple that it&#39;s almost impossible to screw them up.  

This is the first place in quite a while that I have been to where I have no complaints.  

None.

I was seated immediately and my server was very pleasant.  She seemed to have her timing down to a tee, as everything that I needed during the course of my meal, she was right there as I needed it.  

I had a breakfast combo where it was 2 eggs, 2 bacon, 2 sausage, one slice of french toast, hash browns and juice.  I ordered with some changes and substitutions and that was met with a smile.  (all bacon, no sausage; strawberries on the french toast; french toast on a separate plate; eggs scrambled soft) 

Everything on the plate was perfection and I didn&#39;t have to wait forever to get it.  The whole meal just flowed smoothly.  

From the previous reviews that I have read, I can say that I experienced none of the problems you&#39;ve all described, so perhaps the owners are looking at this and have made some significant improvements.  You might want to give them another shot.  

Overall, this was a great experience.  Tasty food, personable waitstaff, speedy cooks with an eye for accuracy and plating -- this place has everything.  I will definitely be back again, perhaps this time for lunch."

The food was good and fairly priced. I was turned off by a view of the kitchen where a waitress was standing at the door eating her breakfast but other than that it was a decent meal. When we went to pay we presented the coupon and were told that they could not accept it because they were not set up for it. My argument was that they sent out the coupon which brought us in to try the restaurant and there was no verbiage to state that we could not use it until a certain date when they were prepared. It was only 5 dollars but for them not to honor their coupon and have no apologies either was a real turn off and due to the poor customer service we will take our business else where.

So we got the check with the steak taken off went to the register and the lady in the front asked us how was it?  Before I could answer she answered the phone and ignored us while she talked with her kids. I said excuse me I need to go. She then looked at the bill and called another coworker because her dumb butt could not figure out why the bill was different. If she had let me answer her question in the beginning she would know why. Then the other employee came over and called the waitress to verify like we wrote our own bill. Bunch of idiots.

I wanted French Toast which is a new thing for me but I&#39;ve yet to find one outside of my Dad&#39;s kitchen that I like.  My oldest ordered a taco salad and my little one ordered a cheeseburger.  The food came and we were pleasantly surprised.  the portions were huge and it looked and smelled fantastic!  We started eating and wow.  just wow!

The crepe ONLY had strawberries on it and they weren&#39;t sweet, when most crepes come with some type of cream cheese in the inside. So we decided to try the restaurant another day I order my meal and a crepe on the side, this time I asked can they add cream cheese and yes they did they added a dolup of plain unsweetened cream cheese, the plain cream cheese that you put on a bagel, so that was a fail again and of course the strawberries were not ripe again. When we received our check I saw that they charged us $7.70 for one crepe, i couldn&#39;t believe it because I was just there the other day and the waitress charged us a $1.95. I asked to speak to the manager and he was afraid to come and talk to us at or table so I went to him. Pete was the owner and he was VERY rude he told me this is my restaurant and I can charge whatever I want, I told him it was your waitresses responsibility to inform the customer home much it would be. He said this is how much it is and I&#39;m not going to change it. I paid my bill and left I will never return to this establishment how could you be so rude to your customers.

The advantage to this location is plenty of close-by free parking - the disadvantage is it can be hard to spot from Main Street and the lounge is a rather small &#34;shotgun&#34; style venue. The appetizers of fried schrimp and sliders were very good and the specialty cocktails (raspberry martini and lemon drop martini) were excellent.  They feature live bands on the weekend but the small lounge makes it difficult to dance.  On weekend nights management might like to consider pulling half of the center tables for dancing as there were open seats along the long side wall. The night we were there it was an older crowd but that might have been the band followers as it was a 60s-70s cover band.

I&#39;m pleased to say that the food here was even better!  We ordered a side of shrimp tempura (the batter they used was delicious), one of their specialty dishes, and the Kang Panang curry (the one with peanut sauce).  All of the food was delicious, with just the right amount of spice to add an interesting element to the dishes without making you cry because your mouth is on fire.  

Unlike Thai Happiness, Thai Medallion is not BYOB, offering a standard selection of wines as well as some interesting Thai and local beers.  

Overall, I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for well-priced, authentic, and enjoyable Thai food.  The only criticism I can offer was that the restaurant was a little dark inside."

I didn&#39;t even know it was right beside the train station until I searched Thai restaurants in Yelp. But, our family went there for an early Mother&#39;s Day lunch...and everything we ordered were delicious! 

We ordered the Som Tum (green papaya salad) and Pla Koong ( shrimp salad). We also ordered Pad Thai and Drunken Noodle. The salads were fresh and crunchy. The noodles were quite tasty and perfectly cooked.

For drinks, we had Thai iced tea. Kinda wished it was free refill because it was cool and refreshing. Sadly, it was not...

The place was small with a few tables. There was a bar that seemed well-stocked. There was only one other customer aside from us. I thought it was weird since the food was great, at least the ones we tried. 

Service was good though I felt our server talked a lot to the other table because they knew each other from before. But, our water glasses were always filled and the wait for our food was not that long. So, I can&#39;t complain.

This is our new go-to Thai place."

I had my doubts as I&#39;ve found its hard to find close to authentic food as most places &#34;americanize&#34; the dishes.

I was pleasantly surprised. I had the Panang curry and asked them to make it spicy. It was pretty darn to close to some of my favorite spots in Bangkok for this dish. Service was also good."

The location makes it feel &#34;off the beaten path&#34; a bit as it&#39;s right across the street from the Naperville Metra/Train station/ across from the park. The parking is easy on the weekend with spots directly in front of the buildling.

The inside space is very very nice; with a small bar area that is fully stocked and formal table settings. We went on a Sunday evening around 5:00 and there were 2 other couples there, so the atmosphere was quiet and relaxing.
The food was good. The Chicken Pad Thai was the best I&#39;ve found in Naperville so far (Bravo Thai Medallion!) and the husband had the Sweet and Sour Chicken with white rice which was devoured; I guess it was good. We ordered crab ragoon, which were not as good as most places; they were very small and the filling wasn&#39;t very (at all) flavorful, so I&#39;d skip those next time for sure.
Overall, I&#39;d go back to Thai Medallion. It&#39;s a good little place."

Thailand Medallion did not disappoint. I ordered the Penang Chicken Curry and my husband the See Ew. The portions were just right and the food was well prepared. I like the way they brought to our table an assortment of 3 condiments to add spice/heat to the meal. I assume that is standard operating procedure with whatever meal you order. My favorite was the red Thai chili sauce. I like food spicy so that suited me. We topped off the meal with Mango Sticky Rice , a dessert we enjoyed from street vendors in Bangkok. It was good too but would have liked it swimming in more of the yummy coconut milk sauce. It was also fun watching the action at the train station as we sat by the window. We will certainly be back."

Anyhow, if you enjoy thai, do give it a look.  I enjoyed my chicken and vegetable curry, date enjoyed his seafood.  The fish was remarkably well prepared - I would order seafood next time.  They offer a few beers and wines.

It was an interesting evening as mom, who doesn&#39;t do spicy, went for the &#34;spicy catfish.&#34; I think secretly she wants me to eat more fish, as she abruptly tasted my dish and proceeded to help herself to mine. I got a tablespoon of my dish, Pad Pao Taek and I had the spicy catfish, even though they offered to make her what ever else she may desire. I&#39;m no Thai expert but I am a fan of &#34;Thai Medallion, Authentic Thai Cuisine&#34;. The brown rice is by far becoming a favorite of mine too. I look forward to many repeat visits.

This is a family affair and our family certainly wish them good fortune here in downtown Naperville, as their first Thai restaurant &#34;Le S&#39;iam&#34;, near Rt. 59 and Aurora Rd. is going on their 18th year. I&#39;ve never had a Thai &#34;Grandma&#34; in the kitchen till now, if you want authentic... you&#39;ll find it here. 

The complimentary dessert was something even my mom liked... and she doesn&#39;t do deserts. Oh wait, I forgot all about my first encounter with their Thai Tea, oh so glad I did! BTW... liquor license is on it&#39;s way, stay tuned if you need a cocktail. ;-)"

I liked the restaurant peace and quiet, but the food was only ok, and I think they can do better.  The green papaya salad was quite spicy, and we had it mild (it may have been the spiciest salad I&#39;ve ever had).  The green curry beef was ok, but a bit light on the beef for $9.95.  The chicken pad thai was over the top sugary.  I liked that they offered Chimey ale - a bottled Begian ale.  If you like Thai in Naperville, it&#39;s worth a try, and I&#39;m glad we did.

The salmon salad was delicious, drunken noodle is my go to and it was very good, the presentation on the spring rolls was amazing.

Also, instead of being a noodle dish, as the name implies, it came with a side of rice.

The second time, I ordered the same dish, but asked that it be stir fried with wide noodles instead of with a side of rice.  When I arrived to pick up my order, I was informed it was an additional $2 charge to substitute the noodles!  When I asked why, I was told &#34;that&#39;s what the manager&#39;s policy is for substitutions.&#34;  Then when I arrived home and opened my food, I realized that they did not stir fry the noodles with the dish.  The noodles were piled into a styrofoam contained alone.  This resulted in a sticky pile of bland noodles that were not edible.  I will not return to this restaurant."

Worst Thai ever - chicken fried rice had chicken from lunch or last night - cold, dry and very little.

It was some of the best Thai food that I have ever had. Naperville has a plethora of Thai restaurants. All of them are at least acceptable, but this place really tops them out.

The service was prompt, efficient and thoughtful. The satay and its accompanying peanut sauce were scrumptious. We also had the crying tiger beef appetizer. It was some of the best beef ever. The chef told us that it was marinated. The spring rolls were tasty. The main course, beef pad thai, came hot and wonderfully prepared.

The bathrooms are clean and the general decor of the place is muted lighting and soft colors. The architectural preparations done to create a space for an eating area was well thought out.

I do hope that others discover this place. While not quite in downtown, there is no reason that it could not be hopping, especially with the proximity to the train station."

We&#39;ve been back three times now and have also done takeout twice.  The food has always been excellent. Why they don&#39;t have more customers is a complete mystery to me. Maybe it&#39;s the location?

A few members of our group didn&#39;t seem to have the best time, but they&#39;re notoriously hard to please. We tried a few of the appetizers (crab rangoon, chicken shumai, vegetable potstickers) and they came out very fast. Between the eight of us, we tried a little bit of everything from their menu. Everyone was fairly pleased. 

The service was a bit awkward -- but we were a large group and the only ones in the restaurant -- so that will happen.  Ultimately, it&#39;s a great alternative to the other Thai places in the downtown Naperville area (Bangkok Villiage, Jin 28), which can get old after a while. 

Wish them the best of luck, as their particular location away from the heart of the downtown and next to the Metra station seems notorious for failed restaurants."

We&#39;ve tried all of the local Thai restaurants within about a 15 minute drive of Naperville and this one ranks up there among the best.  Portions were very good, service was excellent, everything was very fresh and the food tasted outstanding!

Our favorites that we ordered were probably the fresh spring rolls, the Tom Yum soup (easily served 4 of us as an appetizer), and the Mussaman Curry ... which is really outstanding!  The only thing to be aware of is that medium is pretty spicy here compared to some other local Thai restaurants.  We ordered the Tom Yum medium and they added fresh chili&#39;s to our soup which was excellent.  I love the extra spice, but it was a little too much heat for some people at our table, so you may want to keep that in mind when ordering - depending on your preference.

We will definitely be back and ordering lots of carry out!  

Unless you&#39;re travelling on METRA, this one is a little off the beaten path (directly next to the south side of the Naperville METRA station), but definitely worth it."

My wife and I shared the Tom Kha soup and Basil Fried rice. Both were solid, and the fried rice had a nice assortment of fresh veggies. Would definitely order from them again.

The shrimp in the soup were very good though. We had drunken noodles with chicken and the noodles were good but the chicken wasn&#39;t the best.

The vegetables on the pepper steak are fresh and still crunchy which is good. The steak are also tender.

The green curry on the other hand seem to be watered-down. The sauce is not as thick as I expected. Also, it lacked the spiciness of Thai food. Maybe a little bit of Thai chilis would be nice.

There is just one server so the service wasnt as good."

The place had only 3 or 4 parties, but it didn&#39;t feel deserted.  The food is different from what you find at most Thai restaurants there days.  It is more interesting and very nicely but gently spiced.  They ask you how spicy you want it.  There is quite a variety of appetizers, soups, salads.  But the house specials are the really outstanding items - dishes I haven&#39;t seen at other area Thai places.  The food is moderately expensive, but their top quality justifies the price.  The main dishes are $12 to $18 each, and are adequate, though not huge, for a normal appetite, especially if you add an appetizer, which you should, since they are really outstanding.  For example, we ordered spring roles which you&#39;d think are pedestrian, but not at this place.  The spring rolls are delicious works of art, on a tangy sauce, like top quality sushi rolls, and you get two large rolls cut into bit seize treats."

I&#39;ve had Thai food all over. I&#39;ve tried every Thai restaurant in Naperville area. This restaurant has become my favorite. It is super authentic just like the Thai food we had in Bangkok and elsewhere in Thailand. It is better than any Thai restaurant I&#39;ve found in downtown Chicago and I lived there for over 10 years before moving to Naperville. One recommended dish out of the ordinary is the Kua Kling with Chicken. Very very spicy but excellent. Give this place a try next time you have a taste for real Thai food.

I had some egg rolls, crab rangoon, larb kai, and chicken garlic &amp; pepper.
The food was fantastic!
If you don&#39;t like your food super spicy, order   it 1 or 2 (on a scale of 1-5)
I ordered mine 4 on the spicy scale and it lived up to its rating.
The service was equal to the food (excellent).
If I could change one thing, it would be the seating.
Every chair at our table was &#34;butt sprung&#34; and it felt like you were going to fall right through the seat.
I still highly recommend it but the condition of the chairs is something they need to address."

I wanted to try a little bit of everything so I ordered quite a bit of food for me and my sister. 

We started with potstickers, spring rolls and some crab ragoons. The ragoons were the best out of the three. They were cooked perfectly and came with an amazing sauce.

We also ordered the pad Thai with tofu and the massamun curry with chicken. The pad Thai was good, but nothing special. The curry though was amazing. Wonderful spices and the chicken was juicy and had absorbed the flavor of the curry. 

I would definitely come back here and would order the curry and ragoons for sure. The prices were also extremely reasonable."

But when a restaurant keeps getting better and better then you feel like an idiot that you don&#39;t go there more often.
Especially when you got it wrong the first time. Been back a couple times since my first review here and I couldn&#39;t be more impressed with the food. The portions are not only large but the food is beyond fresh and flavorful. You can do Thai right and sometimes it can go wrong. Fortunately I was the one wrong with my first review because the food here could not be any more right on value and taste. Easily the best Thai restaurant on both aspects in the western suburbs. 

Will add more later. And update on what was ordered. But in the mean time Delicious food getting cold and there is no excuse for that."

Not as good as a 4, but not quite as low as a 3. Therefor, since I know how important reviews can be, I gave them a 4.Came here for a dinner meeting, and overall the food was good. Unfortunately for any Thai place in the area, they have to compare to Siam Noodle &amp; Rice, which is not easy to do. The Pad Thai was above average compared to most places around, but I found it a little on the too sweet side. The Panang Curry Chicken was good, just not great. The egg rolls were mushy on the inside, so I am not sure if these were double cooked, but it was not appealing. The service was very friendly, but little slow. We ordered an appetizer, and they brought that out at the same time as our food. I wouldn&#39;t have ordered an appetizer if I would have known that. We also had to hunt them down to get our check. Overall, decent Thai food for the burbs that I would eat at again if in the area, but wont drive out of my way to eat it."

I got the lunch special which comes with appetizer and soup. 
The soup was good, chicken and rice. The appetizer was served with my meal; vegetable spring rolls. The rolls were a bit bland. 
The main course was to rave about! The pad Thai was delish!! So flavorful! I upgraded to shrimp for $3 and received only 3 shrimps. That was a bit disappointing, but it is what it is. Everything is made fresh. As soon as I placed my order, I heard the kitchen fire up!

Whenever we arrive Sam, the manager/owner greets us right away and allows us to sit where comfortable and gives us water.
The food comes quickly, like within 10-15 minutes of arrival and is always nice and hot.  The food is amazingly fresh tasting and looks great!  Their iced coffee is amazing as well, super flavorful and is mixed with coconut milk.

Panang Noodles with a spicy level of 4 (from 1-5) was the perfect amount of spice, veggies and noodles with lots of flavor. My husband ordered the Mussamun Curry which was also delicious. Our bite size Crab Rangoon was a pleasant surprise!

We were running errands in the Burbs and starving. Wanted something quick that wasn&#39;t awful fast food, and we figure our options were limited outside the city.

We drove by this place and figured it was worth trying. So pleasantly surprised! Very friendly guy at the counter. Ordered chicken basil fried rice and schechuan chicken at &#34;3&#34; level spicy to go. Couldn&#39;t believe how much  food came! Chicken dish came w white rice, and the fried rice was so loaded w veggies and chicken it looked like another entree itself. We also got veggie egg rolls- not sure if it was thrown in or part of the meal, but we had way more food than we expected. 

Lots of flavor, good amount of spice. All said and done we have enough for dinner, too, and it only cost $19 for everything. Was very impressed."

I had known about Somsri for quite a while, and being a frequent Thai diner (Thipi in GE, Pad Thai Etc. in Wheaton), I knew that Somsri warranted a try, because variety is the spice of life.

I can&#39;t say anything about the actual restaurant because my roommate (mom) picked up my order at about 815 on a Thursday night. It took 10 minutes from call to pickup. Very fast!

I ordered Tom Yum Pork (a small bowl for 4.99) and the Pad Thai Chicken (8.99). The bowl of soup is a very good size. Same with the Pad Thai dish!

As for the soup, very yummy. Not the best tom yum I&#39;ve ever had, but certainly better than other ones I&#39;ve had. Lots of fresh veggies, and surprisingly, lots of pork! A lot of Thai places skimp on protein, but not here!

The Pad Thai chicken was excellent as well. Plenty of veggies and chicken! Seasoned well too; not sure what type of seasoning they used, but it was good enough that I licked the to go pan it came in. On the savory to sweet scale, I would say it was more towards the sweet side. Not too sweet, but very good.

Somsri is very good, and it&#39;s fairly priced. It&#39;s nice to have another Thai option in the area. My favorite Thai of all time remains Thara Thai in Champaign, Illinois, but Somsri has a chance to become my favorite in the suburbs.One of the easiest barometers to use while judging a restaurant is if I will return. Would you like to know my answer? Contract Arnold Schwarzenegger for the answer."

Strike #1-- it came with rice, no noodles. WTF?! 
Strike #2-- some of the chicken was undercooked. I ended up microwaving it.
Strike #3-- the vegetables were undercooked. It seemed like they just threw them in the sauce without cooking them. Yuck.

Since I am not a total monster, the plus side of my experience was that the curry sauce was tasty, the owner/cook guy was friendly, and it was pretty inexpensive. Sadly though, that will not be enough for me to give this place another shot. Total bummer, as I was really looking forward to some good Thai food close to home. Epic fail.

More accurately, I would say that it&#39;s 4.5 stars.

The food was outstanding and the owners/servers are friendly. It&#39;s small. The parking is plentiful. Also, if one were daring enough to make a trek from the Emerald City, Chicago, this restaurant is within SUPER easy walking distance of the Winfield Metra (UP-West Line) stop. Just cross under the tracks.

I found that there was simply not enough servers on to meet the demands of this place, hence, less than five stars.

The bathrooms were OK, which helps the overall impression that I got.

On a side note, it appears that Somsri takes up at least part of the space that the now (and fortunately) defunct Winfield House restaurant utilized many years ago.

I highly recommend Somsri.

For those of you unfamiliar with Winfield, it&#39;s just west of Wheaton, along the Roosevelt Road (Illinois Route 38) corridor.  Somsri is just south of the tracks."

I didn&#39;t even know about this place until I looked on Yelp trying to find another place that would be as good as the one we used to go to before it closed down. 

I can&#39;t say anything about the restaurant because my sister and her husband picked up the food. But the food was awesome. The only thing I would recommend to others is unless you want your food EXTREMELY spicy, order everything mild. We ordered medium spicy but it was slightly too spicy. Maybe due to the holiday season, we also received a appetizer combination platter on the house. 

I would definitely recommend this restaurant to everyone."

I&#39;ve been to so many restaurants like this in the past and a lot of the time, they are stuffy and hot.  Not so here.

The owner was there and was very friendly and inviting.

Now for the food...I had the Green Chicken Curry.  It was wonderful.  This has always been my favorite Thai dish and I tend to judge Thai restaurants by this dish.  This dish was the real deal.  Just the right amount of veggies, chicken, coconut milk, and curry.  I loved it.

I will definitely come back here regularly in the future and highly recommend it!"

The fact that this place has positive reviews proves that &#39;wurbanites are completely desperate for Thai food. The Pad See Ew was inedible and even the rice was horrible. I took one bite of wanton soup and tossed the rest. It&#39;s kind of weird, because the food looked OK. 

The owner was super friendly though and the meal was ready on time. Also, they give you free egg rolls, which we couldn&#39;t eat, but it&#39;s the thought that counts. Right? If you have no other Thai experience to compare it to, you may (and I stress may) be able to enjoy eating here, but probably not."

Tonight I called and placed our first order.  My husband actually picked up the food, so I can not comment on the interior - but I will tell you that the man who took the order via telephone was very kind and polite and expressed his appreciation.  When my husband picked up the food he asked that we let him know how it was and how he was doing, and he threw in an order of crab rangoon.  As someone who is BIG on customer service I really thought it was great that he so sincerely wanted feedback.  Well I&#39;m so glad to say that it was FABULOUS.  Glad because we now have more delicious ethnic food in Winfield, and glad because I can give great feedback to someone so lovely.

I dove into the crab rangoon first, which was done really, really well.  Instead of the oversized &#34;too much wonton too little crab/cream&#34;, these were bite sized pieces with a delicious crab/creme filling that was really exceptional.  Their sweet and sour was also great and didn&#39;t have that artificial sweetness like so many others.  Really delicious.

We also ordered the Panang Curry with Chicken and Pad Thai with Tofu.  The Panang was mouth watering and had a beautiful color and consistency and the spices were just right.  The chicken was great and we both loved the dish.  Pad Thai is one of those things I&#39;ll always order first from a Thai place I&#39;ve never been to.  Its such a staple that if it isn&#39;t right I just won&#39;t go back.  Fortunately, it was perfect.  I always like a little lime wedge with mine, but it didn&#39;t come with one.  Oh well, not a big deal at all.  I&#39;m not even sure that&#39;s a &#34;standard&#34; thing, anyway. We also had the spring rolls.  These were your basic spring rolls, and they were very nice. 

All in all I think Somsri is an amazing addition to our little local cuisine scene and we are really lucky to have them here.  We&#39;ll absolutely be back.  Can&#39;t wait! Delicious!"

This is a place that my husband and I really wanted to like. We went the first time and our experience was pretty bad. Well, so we gave it a second chance and it wasn&#39;t much better. It takes a while to get the pizza and it states on the menu that their &#34;homemade pies&#34; take 25-30 minutes to make. 


SERVICE:
Not the greatest. Maybe they&#39;re understaffed like so many of the reviews say, but hire some people! There are tons of unemployed Americans that need jobs. Whatever. It took a few minutes for us to be seated both times, even though there were booth open and not a ton of families there at the time. I asked for tips on drinks, but the waitress told me she doesn&#39;t drink beer. Ok, but my question was on the cider. Ok, I&#39;m not going to ding her for not drinking alcohol. She never offered us another round, nor brought us water. After finishing our drinks during the appetizer, she never was really around for longer than a second to even think about bringing us anything.
My husband said that he would give the service 3 stars, but I disagree..closer to 1-2.


FOOD:
Garlic bread:
We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer. We received it maybe 15 minutes after ordering it. For what it was, it should&#39;ve taken 10 minutes. It was overdone and burnt **the second pic is of the garlic bread they brought out second&#34;. It was literally rock hard. Also, no garlic. The second basket brought was better and not hard, but still just like glorified toast. It was like an italian beef roll cut in quarters and toasted, then with butter on it. No fresh garlic, and not even the crappy garlic powder that some restaurants use for their garlic bread. Pretty disappointed.

Pizza:
Good, but nothing to write home about. I like the texture of the braided crust, but there&#39;s really nothing else that is greater than average. About 2-3 pieces of nickel sized sausage per piece of our sausage and garlic pizza. Average pizza, that&#39;s what I would call it.

Drinks:
They have a good selection beer/cider/wine list. For that, I give them a star. Unfortunately, the average bar has a good selection.

It takes a significant amount of time to order, wait for food, and then wait for the bill after finishing food. The service isn&#39;t the greatest. I wish we would&#39;ve had a better time, either time, but we won&#39;t be back. With so many other pizza places in the area, we won&#39;t be back."

This is my first review only because this was way outside of the norm of service you receive anywhere and management, as well as potential patrons, need to be aware and have some expectations set if you are lucky to have our server.

We were in town for a family reunion. This place had solid reviews both in ratings and quantity. It was not very busy, maybe two other tables, and we were greeted by a sweet girl directing us to our table. 

And that&#39;s when it went downhill. How you may ask when we just walked in? It started with our server beginning to take our drink orders and abruptly saying she will be back when someone yelled at her from the oven. This set the tempo as our server brought everything over with the cold hand of indifference including her robotic, insincere, and minimal conversational tone. 

For the record, we ordered a few drinks and a bottle of wine, Valley of the Moon, from their reserve menu along with several pizzas and some gelato for our daughter. EVERYTHING was GREAT. 

Disappointing we had to get her attention to get anything. You know...as in pretending we were waving down a plane to rescue us at one point. She was not engaging. No refills on beer or coke offered. Our bottle of wine was brought over, sans cork, already open with two glasses. She was never in any hurry. Making eye contact was difficult and when it did happen it provided the opposite reaction from what we needed. I walked over to the bar and register, where she was hiding from giving any additional discretionary effort, and I begin speaking to my 8yr old daughter about dessert. We eventually ordered there, with her, because why would we not want someone to ask us if we needed dessert as is the almost knee jerk reaction tradition of any server. Kudos for being different. She did not look up. I finally asked what the gelato flavors were where she recited. We choose and walked back. 

Her engagement was reminiscent of a 160 character restriction on Twitter. She only thanked us while we were walking out, which obviously was facetious and muscle memory.

We tipped 20% because who knows what day she had. I hope it gets better. For me, if I lived here I would never return because of the very negative, memorable experience we had. 

Again great pizza! But maybe you need a buffet because we could have fumbled around serving and smiling at our table ourselves...or hire nicer robots."

Service on the phone was very nice and friendly. We ordered a medium spinach, sausage and mushroom pizza with their original crust. Was about $23 before tip and we were told 45 minutes.  It came in about 25-30. The pizza was very good, cooked to perfection. They have a nice sweet sauce and very good house made sausage.  My only complaints are that it was a bit pricey for a medium pizza and that the dough, while good, was a little too soft and doughy. I like my crust a bit thinner and crisper.  I loved the sauce and the sausage and did enjoy the pizza as a whole. Next time, I&#39;ll try the thin crust...and dine in to enjoy their extensive beer list."

I guess we go in the love category. I have had 2 parties here, both in the range of 30 guests, and I have dined her on several occasions. Maybe others prefer pizza made ahead? I just don&#39;t get it. To make a pizza this good it takes time!! It is not sitting in a box on a hot plate or under a burner.

And yes, the beer selection is great! They have successfully converted me from a wine only drinker. 

But honestly - it&#39;s all about the people. Whether it&#39;s Mike or his mom or his dad - they care about you as a customer and  a person. And of course Ryan, Kelsey and all the wait staff are great people. Eric and the crew make great food and Andy and the behind the scenes crew really do an awesome job.

Did someone actually envisage a vintage 1950&#39;s pizza joint with a modern day spin? The floor plan is open with plenty of classic booths. It&#39;s simple, inviting and it works. The view at the end of the bar allows you to continually scan the entire operation. I liked the environment, not so much the pizza.

Basically the yelp reviews are telltale with a very clear point; if you serve &#34;Craft Beers&#34; &amp; &#34;Signature Pizza&#34; you must be &#34;Kick-Ass-Good&#34;! NFW! 

Again, the beer selection and  Customer Service dominate each review. A description of &#34;Taste&#34; is brief and secondary in thought. Agree, management and staff will kill you with &#34;Kindness&#34;!

However, what about the taste?  BLAND. &#34;Ach-N-Lou&#39;s&#34; Pizza Pub in Aurora smokes this place. By severe contrast, &#34;Emil&#39;s&#34; pizza found in Woodman&#39;s freezer case will inspire your taste buds.

Our 16&#34; Thin Crust...Sausage, Mushroom, Onion &amp; Black Olive arrived cool to the touch with a spongy crust. Not OK, let it be known this is the first time in a while I did not scorch the roof of my mouth!  A pathetic presentation equaled in taste.

I&#39;m sorry, if your looking for a classic tavern style pizza, look elsewhere. But if your pizza taste buds crave the &#34;Hand Crafted Italian Beef and Giardiniera&#34;, The&#34; B-L-T&#34;or the &#34;Bacon Cheeseburger&#34; SIGNATURE PIZZA PIE...hey, this is your place.

For me, the above is best served on fresh bread as a sandwich, not pizza.

(One side note before I get into this, since I&#39;ve been in restaurants most of my life, I&#39;m going to say that they were understaffed and there was a major issue that they just didn&#39;t mention to anybody, so take this as you will)

We sat down and the restaurant wasn&#39;t even half full, we then proceeded to wait and wait and wait and wait for pizza. I have never in my life got up before I received the food, but in this case I had to get it to go and left... I understand pizza can take a while, but wow... The only thing that I ate while I was there was the garlic bread, not my cup of tea and when we did finally eat the pizza, I was even less impressed.

My other gripe is that our server kept taking her order pad and despite the fact that she has an apron with multiple pockets, stuck it in the back of her pants by her underwear. Frankly, I don&#39;t want your hands touching anything that&#39;s touched your butt, if they are going to touch my food."

First time there is was really good.  One of the owners greeted and sat us - told us a bit about the family owned restaurant and fresh ingredients and specialities - and the food was really good. The marinara was really good and the meatballs were awesome.  We went back a few more times and thought that we found a nice spot we would be coming to for years. 

So...why the 2 stars?  Well, we went back about a month ago and had really bad and slow service. We sat a long time and waited for the server to come and greet us at the table. Then it took a very long time for each phase of the meal and we actually got the feeling we were more of a bother to the server than anything. He didn&#39;t seem to really care to do his job one bit. We chalked it up as a one off and that maybe he was having a bad day.  But... We went back again last night and had a very similar experience.  Eventually that same waiter came over, but only to tell us that our waitress is coming soon. She did, and we order a very simple meal: 2 unsweetened iced teas, a meatball sandwich, and the bruschetta. It took 10 minutes for her to bring us the very watered down iced tea (might as well just drink water). Then it took another 47 minutes to get our food. Yes, I timed it after the iced teas took so long.  47 minutes for a meatball sandwich and bruschetta!  Unfriendly, blah attitudes to with that awful service too.  To add insult to injury, my wife got sick that night and I felt like complete crap too. 

Could it be us?  Did we do something to piss them off?  Why the crappy service?  We are not demanding people and always treat people in restaurants nicely regardless of how they are because 1) we are respectful; 2) we don&#39;t want spit and boogers in our food. Plus, we always tip - even when the service is not deserving. So, it seems to me that it&#39;s just how this place operates. Regardless, the service is so bad that we will just go elsewhere. 

Oh yah, 2 stars. Well, the 3 non stars are for the last 2 servers and experience, plus the decline in food and getting sick. The 2 stars given are because I know the owner is a good guy and we had a nice experience with him our first few visits. Too bad his servers don&#39;t have the same attitude with customer service as he does."

When we complained about how long the pizza took - after 37 minutes with no one coming to check on us or refill our drinks - they said it was because everything was handmade. Are they making the dough from scratch that moment??? You can get a deep dish pizza from scratch and have it to your table sooner. Some employees said 20-25 minutes to get a pizza; another said 30. No matter what, it took 45 minutes with almost no other customers for us to get a pizza. The frustrating part is, the waiter just kept making excuses about being shorthanded - but 7 people working when it is not busy is not shorthanded - it is inefficiency.

So this may fall into what I call the &#34;Hangover Effect&#34;. I saw rave reviews and had high hopes. (This happened with that movie The Hangover - people said it was the most hilarious movie ever made of all time EVER...I saw It.  I laughed once. I believe I may have laughed at least double that, had it not been so, so hyped.)

Anyway - I was intrigued with Italian Nachos. Whaaat? turns out, it was sauce and cheese over nacho chips with Italian beef sprinkled on top (for $2 more bucks). 
Overall it was a little disappointing. 

We got the &#34;original crust&#34; ala supremo. So...and maybe those of you in North Aurora had once experienced the nectar of Gods that was Franks Pizza - and if so, please know that this is where I was - Franks was our favorite. But this was not Franks. Boo. The crust was bland. It was crusty on the outside and warm and pillowy on the inside, but it lacked depth beyond that. The sauce was under seasoned. actually, the whole pizza seemed under seasoned. I mean, it wasn&#39;t the worst pizza by any stretch of the imagination - but it didn&#39;t blow any socks off either. Also - when the menu said &#34;ask for dipping sauce&#34; with the crust style - we did and we thought it would be garlic butter sauce...and it wasn&#39;t. just bland marinara. Lesson learned.

The service was extraordinarily friendly. There was one young guy in there running the whole of front of house-  the bar and all the tables and the running of food. It wasn&#39;t that busy but that kid was working his tail off. 

We heard the beer selection was awesome, but we weren&#39;t drinking and frankly, I am not a beer person but maybe that would change things...the Italian beef that had been sprinkled on our nachos was good and I would consider returning to try the beef on its own...but probably not the pizza."

So, using the excuse that I still didn&#39;t have my kitchen organized enough to cook, we headed out to try Raimondo&#39;s. 

First of all, the thing that got us here is that they have a pretty nice beer selection. While I wish a little more was on draft, the bottled selection was diverse and exciting. Even better, their staff really seems to have a passion for it and took to suggesting beers for us based on what we had already ordered. 

We ordered a double dough with giardiniera and sausage. The pizza was really delish! The toppings were clearly very fresh and sauce was fantastic. Normally left over pizza is just something I need to get through, but I was super excited to come home the next night and heat it up again. It really was a well made delicious pizza. I&#39;m excited to try more combinations of toppings as they definitely give you a TON of choices. 

One of the owner&#39;s came over and asked how everything was and mentioned that he didn&#39;t think he&#39;d seen us in there before (they clearly know their customers). We told him we just moved in and he insisted we have some gelato on the house. It was such a nice gesture. He also asked where we were at and let us know that they deliver as well, which is great! Its a nice atmosphere, so I&#39;d definitely like to dine in and enjoy the beer selection most of the time, but having the delivery option is always good too. 

If you are in the area and in the mood for some homemade fresh pizza, don&#39;t pass this place up! I know we will definitely be back."

My wife went to Raimondo&#39;s with a friend a while ago and told me I should check it out because they have a pretty interesting beer selection and the beer guy there (Mike) is pretty enthusiastic about it. 

Well, she was right and it&#39;s one of my favorite places now. The beer selection is excellent (especially for trying stuff you may not be able to get in the stores), the pizza is fantastic, the pastas and sandwiches are great, and even the gelato is good. 

Beyond all of that, though, is the atmosphere. There are people enjoying beers at the bar, older folks, younger folks, and lots of families when we go. My 2-year-old son asks me about Susie and Ryan and Mike a lot - he loves the attention they give him (and the pizza, of course). 

There are beer tasting events, charitable events, and other cool community things all the time. I had my first beer from Solemn Oath there, for example. Also, after their St. Baldrick&#39;s event, most of the staff was shaved bald! That&#39;s some commitment. 

Overall, I miss the old-fashioned pizza joints from the past. (Charlotte&#39;s, Shakey&#39;s, etc.) There&#39;s a personality to them that&#39;s not manufactured by some marketing focus group. Raimondo&#39;s has that warmth and personality. It&#39;s just a nice place with great food and excellent people."

The buffalo wings were terrible. The skin was rubbery and the sauce was tasteless. When I returned them the owner explained to me that they&#39;re supposed to be that way!!? He explained that they do not make them themselves. They also bake them because they don&#39;t have a fryer. He buys this brand because they are gluten free (no breading). While I appreciate that the business has gluten free options I am not gluten sensitive and wanted crispy tasty buffalo wings, not baked chicken with gross sauce.

Definitely would go back.

I had driven by it many times and kept saying I need to try this place.  Well I shouldn&#39;t have waited.  Great food, great service, and great prices about sum it up.  

We started off with the cheesy garlic bread appetizer.  Real garlic, lots of cheese and what must be a homemade marinara sauce to dip it in.  Next was a medium half sausage half mushroom original pizza.  The mushrooms where fresh and tasty and the sausage was out of this world.  Same great sauce as the appetizer.  

Don&#39;t remember the servers name, but attentive would be an understatement.  He kept the drinks filled, made sure we had everything we needed and could not have done a better job.

The decor is modern and comfortable.  Everything is clean.  Plenty of parking.  

Add in a couple of soft drinks and we were out the door for $26 + tip.  

We will be back!"

Wasn&#39;t sure if this was just a sit down place or if it was a order at the counter place. I was happy when I arrived today that I can order at the counter and get Pizza by the slice. Raimondo&#39;s saved me from the nasty pizza hut express down the street. The pizza here is home made and taste great. The people here are friendly and accommodating. The restaurant was also very clean and much nicer then my other lunch alternatives.  Because I went during work hours I didn&#39;t get to try any of the beers but they also have a great beer selection with many different selections. Looking forward to coming back and trying one of the sandwitches or Itialian dishes.

Crust was gross - soggy and undercooked. They were generous with the toppings, but the crust was too flimsy to withstand them.

The pizza and lasagna rank as some of the best in the area.  I&#39;ve had other foods here, but those are the best.  The beer selection is fantastic with a focus on imported and craft beers.  My wife and I are pretty regular customers, and we are on a first name basis with most of the staff.

A few things I will point out.  The service is good, but at times a bit slow.  That&#39;s not a problem for most people.  I&#39;ve always felt that the atmosphere is one that invites you to stay, drink, and have a good time.  However, some times we are in a hurry and still want to eat in.  There&#39;s an easy solution.  Just call your order in on your way out the door, and you&#39;ll have a quicker meal."

The food is 5 star quality. I especially love the ravioli and bruschetta!

The service however, is hit or miss. I am hoping this is simply due to the newness of the business. Three out of 5 times we have had great service. The other two times were awful - one resulting in us walking out after being seated for 10 minutes without being acknowledged (this was on an extremely busy evening but nonetheless not an excuse)! 

I will continue to be a customer because of the times we have had a wonderful experience, along with the delicious food. I will try to stick to weekdays or lunch hours if dining in though."

Nicest service ever from a place where I&#39;m not a regular. 
Pizza was damn good, maybe not as authentic as the love of my life (v&amp;v paesano..mmmm) but very good. 
I love how there&#39;s a bar here. Also, they offer a selection of craft beers that is ever changing. 
My bf and I came in on a Friday night-- we ordered wings (which I can&#39;t eat, tear) and a supreme pizza (half veggie) and were immediately told our wait time. That like never happens.  The owner (can&#39;t for the life of me remember his name) came over and chatted us up, talked about the history of Raimondo&#39;s (previously located on 31 from 1989-01), and his status as a craft brew aficianado.  I honestly don&#39;t recall what they had on tap-- I&#39;m strictly wine/vodka for the most part, but you could tell he was very passionate about his beer..and his business.
According to my bf, the wings were excellent, and as I mentioned before-- the pizza (and wine) were great.  The service bumped this pace up to 5 stars for me, it was so accomodating and genuine, no fake niceness here!!"

Their pizzas are really good and they offer pies all day long (either made to order or by-the-slice.) 

I also really appreciate the hospitality they offer here.  Michael is very friendly and accommodating and always makes my husband and I feel very welcome.

In addition to good food and gelato, they also have a unique variety of wine and beer,  and both are priced very reasonably."

Not to mention the actual customers dining there, it is literally like being on the set of Cheers, everyone wants to chit chat and converse, share stories and just shoot the breeze. The food, OUTSTANDING!! Ordered a large thin crust with sausage, black olives and mushrooms ..just so so so good! 

I tried their on-tap Oktoberfest by Bells brewing, and it was fantastic. The owner, Mike, then insisted that I try the Sam Adams Pumpkin Ale, claiming he was a big fan of it. Tried it, loved it! Buying a case asap as a matter of fact. 

But back to the point ... Raimondo&#39;s is an excellent place to get phenomenal food, and be surrounded and served by the greatest staff in Chicagoland, and friendliest people you can imagine. It&#39;s almost as if all the nicest people in the area just flock to this place to eat and watch the game and drink great beer. That&#39;s another thing ..their beer selection is out of this world!! You don&#39;t often find a place that offers the really rare and hard to find brews, you usually have to go deep into Chicago for that, and its usually $8+ per draft/bottle there! This is not your typical sports bar by any means ;) 

Reasonable prices, amazing food, great staff, wonderful and friendly atmosphere, fast service and a top notch beer selection. Yeah, I&#39;ll be back :D

Whether it&#39;s seeing the &#34;dad&#34; blending his homemade sauces, or &#34;mom&#34; being there &amp; ready to help in any capacity it&#39;s truly nice to see their level of care. As a lot of these comments make mention of the owner Michael being knowledgable as he is in not only their homemade menu, but his knowledge of the extensive craft beer menu which he takes allot of pride in &amp; should really helps to narrow down what exactly most likely you&#39;d want. I&#39;d say keep it up, but in a family type establishment such as this, I&#39;m quite confident the actions in which they display are genuine, &amp; they&#39;ll naturally keep it up what they&#39;re so good at doing..."

We actually went here based on the huge amount of 5 star ratings, and I wasn&#39;t as impressed as the reviews indicated. We ordered 3... yes 3, different pizzas, and all were... OK.  One veggie pizza, one custom (bacon, sausage, pepperoni), and the &#34;Godfather&#34; (italian beef &amp; giardiniera). I myself wasn&#39;t a fan of the &#34;original&#34; crust.. just too doughy for me.. if I return I&#39;d definitely go with the thin crust.  I could only finish 2 pieces of pizza, and it was mainly because of the dough... not the toppings.

Of the 3 (I tried all), the custom one was actually my favorite. The bacon was delicious, crisp and flavorful, and the &#34;secret blend&#34; sausage is quite good.  

Our server was decent, he knew a lot about the beer selections. One suggestion to the owners; provide a daily list of beers on a piece of paper or whatever so we don&#39;t have to stand up from our table and try to read the chalkboard every time we order a beer. 

The cheesy garlic bread appetizer we ordered was embarrassingly small. It&#39;s just bread and cheese, and at that price point, it simply needs to be a larger portion.

While we never spoke to the owner personally, he was making his rounds around the place and seemed nice and personable. We did make a reservation and was pleasantly surprised when we arrived that there was a table with a large &#34;Reserved&#34; sign on it with my name on the check. Bonus points for that.

I&#39;m sure eventually we&#39;ll try this place again (my wife loves pizza), and I&#39;ll definitely go with the thin crust next time and probably order my own custom pizza.  Maybe that will make the difference. Good pizza, good service, and as Yelp indicates with a 3-star review, &#34;A-OK&#34;."

 It was better than I remembered and instead of just St Pattys day they offer it all of March it is probably the BEST pizza I have ever ate. Stop by this month and try it you wont be disappointed .

The owner and his team are friendly and helpful - it&#39;s a family-run business and you can tell. Don&#39;t forget to try the gelato - pistachio or double chocolate - both are out of this world.

The pizza is great.  I love thin crust pizza the thinner the better and they will make the crust as thin as possible to order.  They carry a variety of craft beers that changes often and Michael always provides great beer suggestions.  The staff and owners are fantastic.

Like all the other pizza places here in Illinois they cut it in squares &amp; strips... my guess is in this state of Illinois you don&#39;t know what pizza pie means... it&#39;s a PIE!

I&#39;m traditionally a sausage and cheese kinda girl so that&#39;s what I get on the regular. We&#39;ve dined in and taken out and had delivery. 

Our delivery service is always excellent. But our dine in service hasn&#39;t been the best experience. I&#39;ve taken my cousin there a couple of times because she really likes eating at places so the last time we went was kind of the deciding factor that we won&#39;t dine there anymore. 

There&#39;s one lady who has kind of been standoffish to me whenever I&#39;ve been there. She is pleasant enough to take your order and she&#39;s always been correct with our orders, just not the most friendly. 

Now on to the pizza. Oh em gee. The thin crust is my favorite. The sauce is delicious, a little on the sweeter side and there is always plenty of cheese and the crust is always crispy to perfection. It&#39;s even great cold. That&#39;s a real complement for me, for pizza, because I don&#39;t normally like left over cold pizza. I can&#39;t remember the last time I had their deep dish pizza but I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d want to try it again knowing how good the thin crust pizza is!

Also if you want a healthier option...their fried zucchini sticks are good dipped in ranch dressing as well! ;)"

A 4 star review - yay we&#39;re fans!

I came here last week with my family to celebrate my grandparents&#39; 58th anniversary. The food was delicious, wine was flowing, and chatter was in the air. On to the yummy deets.

I enjoyed...

Calamari: crispy, lightly breaded, with marinara sauce and a lemon slice. Hit the spot!

Antipasti salad: great combination of Italian flavor - Mortadella, Cappicola, Genoa salami, cheese, tomatoes, pepperoncini peppers, olives all tossed in their house Italian dressing. 

Italian bread: Standard, but yummy nonetheless.

Pinot Noir: I mean, I had 3 glasses so it&#39;s a win in my book!

White Pizza: My favorite! Loved this non traditional &#39;za. Olive oil (instead of standard pizza sauce), fresh garlic, ricotta cheese and tomatoes.

Pepperoni Pizza: Classically delish. Pepperoni, mushrooms, onion and green pepper. Thin crust what what!

Walnut Gorgonzola Salad: A MUST TRY! I love this salad. Green apple slices, walnuts, avocado, cranberries and crumbled gorgonzola tossed with mixed greens and topped with pomegranate dressing. Such a fresh and fabulous combo!

The only reason Vita Bella didn&#39;t get 5 stars from me is due to the service. I&#39;ll give them the benefit of the doubt because we had a large group and its possible our waitress was training someone, but it was less than ideal.

We were missing silverware and plates so we had to wait a while before diving into our intriguing apps. When our waitress did come by she was so quick to pop in we couldn&#39;t event get a word in to request another drink! Slightly frustrating. 

Everyone has their days though, and my whole group really enjoyed the food and family atmosphere. I&#39;ll be back!"

When we got here they said they made a mistake and it was not ready but would be in about 30 minutes.  Mistakes happen though we do have 15 people waiting at our house for food . We decided to sit in dining room and wait and order drinks/appetizers to pass the time. Secretly I thought they should buy us the drink for mistake lol. Imagine our surprise when the young lady told us we couldn&#39;t sit in dining room it was against their policy if you are waiting for a carry out.  She did say she could talk to a manager but I was already speechless and declined. This is our first visit here and last.  Can&#39;t comment on food because we are still waiting .....

Call me a snobby city guy - but Plainfield is not synonymous with Italian cuisine. 

The first time she took  me to Vita Bella - I was impressed: good beef - mellow atmosphere. The service was very good. They didn&#39;t honor the coupon they sent in the mail - but they gave her another one for our next visit. 

The second time we went - the food was still very good. The service was cosi-cosi. She brought the bread - but not the oil. I was trying to remember if they had oil the first time. I can&#39;t understand bread without oil - but whatever.

Then we had them cater our Labor Day event. We got a tub of mostaccioli. We got a tub full of beef. We got a tub full of chicken. We got a tub full of salad. We got a tub full of garlic bread and one full of Italian bread.(I am kind of tubby so that all worked for me - well maybe not the salad.)

Did I mention the healthy helping of giardiniera and a pan of sweet peppers?

I not only got enough food to feed a small army (or me and four of my buddies) but the quality of the food was pretty stellar. We have all been to a party or an event catered in this style - this was the best one I have ever been to. This food was amazing. People were commenting on it as they shoveled it in. I over ordered - but have no trouble dining on left-overs of this food. 

Here&#39;s the punch line. The price was so reasonable that I  felt like I was getting the deal of the year. I truly feel I got the best value for my hard earned dollar and will be back time and time again. 

I am still not sold on Plainfield - but my girl is there so I&#39;ll be spending more and more time there. Good thing to know there is a good Italian beef waiting for me when I do."

With the last three orders, the pizza has been barely cut and on the last order, the cheese and toppings had slid off the pizza in the box.  I called about it and they said they would give me a $15.00 credit.  I just called tonight to order a pizza.  Guess what - there is no $15.00 credit on file.  And now they say they have no record of me ever ordering from there, even though I&#39;ve had the same phone number for almost 15 years now.  Ridiculous.

The pizza was under cooked crust was soggy, cheese was just melted on the top and pizza was just like warm after waiting 45 minutes. Fried mushrooms also were under cooked as the mushrooms were soggy on the out side and really soggy almost the batter inside was not cooked.   The really bad part was we finally collected the 12 tabs to get the 50% off .  I guess this time we got what we paid for. Hope the kitchen manager takes his time during the busy rush or you&#39; ll will be getting more lousy reviews.  We will try again only because we have been satisfied in the past"

Our server was Isabella - also fantastic. The manager came around as we were finishing up and gave us a free pizza coupon.  Looking forward to going back. Good for the kids too as they have crayons and menus of their own.

We got seated then ordered a glass of wine and a beer and placed an order for stuffed mushrooms. After the first bite, I told my boyfriends I think they&#39;re brought I , or pre-made days in advance since they had absolutely no flavor. When my boyfriend was eating his stuffed mushroom, he almost choked on a BIG piece of plastic. I had known something was off with just the taste, that proved it. Our server, however; Angela, was sweet, attentive, and very professional. She made sure our concerns were addressed, and handled professionally. She is too god for this restaurant that obviously cares little about there quality of food. When a manager on duty came over to discuss the poor quality of the &#34;appetizer&#34;, he apologized and took them off the bill (rightfully so). We ordered prior to the mushrooms a beef sandwich and a pepperoni pizza with mushrooms and sausage that was &#34;homemade&#34; and when that arrived, the disappointment continued with the worst pizza I&#39;ve ever had, and a flavorless beef sandwich that I had ordered got and received otherwise. Horrible food. The server was nice and efficient, but food is. It worth trying. Go elsewhere! I&#39;m giving two stars for service."

That I fully understand, that&#39;s the only way a new employee can learn.

The 12&#34; we ordered was closer to 10&#34;, I can&#39;t even explain the way they cut it. Pie cut shouldn&#39;t be that difficult, and it was the most awkwardly cut pie I have ever seen!!!  2 slices were about 2 inches wide at the crust and the others around 6-7 inches. The crust was horrible, black  stuff all over the bottom from a dirty oven I assume, and very soggy.  I ordered sausage and pepperoni, and actually counted only 1 sausage and 3 pepperoni on one of my slices.

Pizza was very good.  The perfect amount of cheese accompanied by generous amounts of toppings (in this case, sausage and roasted red pepper).  Since the pizza is satisfying, I really want to try the walnut gorgonzola salad now!

Employee who took my order was very friendly and courteous on the phone.  There are always coupons out in the mail, like those clipper things, so keep an eye out."

They will never get your order correct!!!!     Unfortunately this is one of the only places close to me. However, it is not an exaggeration when I say every other order in the last year has been WRONG!!  The pizza will have completely different ingredients than what I ordered. The worst part is it&#39;s not even switched with someone else just plain made wrong, put in the oven with nobody noticing, cut with still nobody noticing, and delivered with still nobody noticing.   At this point I&#39;ll be driving to Little Cesar&#39;s on 135th from now on.  I refuse to pay a dime for another wrong order."

We have ordered takeout, dined in and catered from them and every time the food is hot and fantastic.  

We&#39;ll start with the pizza. We have only had the thin crust, but it is great. Good amount of cheese, sauce and toppings. It has become one of our favorites in the area. 

If you dine in, Mon and Tues kids eat free. They also let your kids create their own pizza at the table which my kids love to do. Service is great too. They also carry some craft beers. 

Catering, was awesome. Everyone kept asking us where we got the food. I would not hesitate to cater from Vita Bella, you won&#39;t be disappointed."

Heck -- I can&#39;t remember the last time I described food as &#34;incredible&#34;, but this is definitely it!  The pizza tastes very fresh, and the flavors of every ingredient and topping are very pronounced.

The thin crust is really paper thin.  They use a special kind of pizza tray to keep the crust crispy -- but just make sure that you ask for it to be crispy if that&#39;s your style.  Also if you prefer squares or triangle shaped slices make sure to specify that when ordering as well.

I&#39;ve tried a variety of dishes here and so far have not been disappointed.  Their baby back ribs are also among the best I&#39;ve had -- which surprised me coming from an Italian restaurant."

Both times were very good.  The first time we went, there was no one in the parking lot and we thought it was closed.  After we were seated, several other diners came in as well.

First time we tried an appetizer, the waitress recommended the homemade bread sticks, they were tossed in garlic butter and grated Romano cheese.  We also were served warm bread after we ordered the breadsticks, CARB OVERLOAD!  We also tried a caesar salad, it was good and a decent size side salad.

We have tried the 
* thin crust meat classic- it is VERY meaty 
* thin crust cheese - lots of cheese and good leftover
* thin crust make your own with spinach, sausage, black olives and mushrooms - had a good amount of sausage, not too much.

Overall, the food was really good and we will be back.  Glad to have found another pizza joint."

The walnut Gorgonzola salad with apples and avocado feeds four and is just over $7.  The chicken limone and chicken Marsala were cooked to perfection. Both tender but too much oil to my liking. My husband did not think there was too much oil. They are right up there with deserving a 5 star but not quite. It was a Friday night at only 430pm. We were the only ones in the restaurant. When word gets out about the good food,  more professional servers, and a few tweeks they will be a 5 star in no time. Oh yeah- lose the plastic table covers. Your building is too nice for those.

The pizza is top notch 5 out of 5 stars easy. I even brought left overs into work and co workers said it was damn good pizza. Delivery is always fast and reliable too, even on a Saturday Night.

The only reason I give it 4 stars is because of their appetizers. Their calamari was not good and didn&#39;t care for the bread sticks. The calamari looked like portillos onion rings and was soggy in the box that they delivered it in. It was hard to believe that the appetizers items were not that good, when their pizza is amazing. I will have to give them a try in the restaurant sometime and see if it is different.

I NEVER do delivery but today I decided I would for a change. The estimated delivery time was 59-69 minutes, and the pizza arrived in 63. That&#39;s spot on!

I went with the white pizza (but swapped out roasted peppers for ricotta) and am yet again amazed with the caliber of their product. I&#39;m normally not a thin crust guy but had to give it a shot, and they&#39;ve masted thin, double dough, pan, and stuffed! 

I ate a lot of bad pizza in this town before coming across this slice of heaven (pun intended) and every crap pizza from anywhere else made it worthwhile!

Next up, Caprese salad. The mozzarella was great, the balsamic dressing good, and greens seemed fresh. Tomatoes were a little mushy but I&#39;m really nitpicking to even bring that up."

The variety of meat on the sandwich was nothing to write home about either.  Not very flavorful and way too salty.  The Caesar salad was large for the price but basically a bowl of romaine and like 4 croutons.  Another lacking dish.

First off its dirty not like a dump where theres trash on it but u know what i mean like when u walk into a place like wtf is this. The service was bad sometimes if u speak english in a mexican restaurant they give u bad service they treat u different and they might talk bad about u in spanish but im mexican so i just laugh. I was there so i saw how they prepared it everything was premade so they just took it out of a bucket ,already cooked, put it in the Microwave to warm it up then just put it on the grill for a second. This is the type of places u come to when ur under the influence i wont come here again lol 

Carne asada: there lil tacos like the small tortillas and a lil meat. It was really bland it needed alot of seasoning. It wasnt heated well. It came with cilanrto and onions.  
The red salsa was really good tip if u dont like something put alot of hot sauce on it and itll make u like it trust me i do that quit often

Al pastor: no pi√±apple so how is that alpastor it needs that thats like having guacamole without avocados doesnt work the flavor of it was really bland nothing special"

I was finally convinced the Bering Straight Land Bridge really existed.

This place is a dive but in a good way.  If you know Spanish it&#39;s a plus.  West Chicago has a large and very nice I might add, Mexican population.  This place is the real deal.  If you are OK eating beef head and know what true Corundas are is you will drool over this place.  Their Mexican sammies are top notch too and massive.

It&#39;s in cute litte West Chicago.  Hey hipsters...this is where the town you SHOULD invest your real estate money in.  Metra train stops in downtown, and they have some unique and oh so affordable housing, not to mention some cool shops and restaurants.  But I digress... This place serves up the type of food you find at authentic dives in towns outside of the resorts you visit in Mexico.

The staff is friendly and tries to understand my broken Spanish.  It&#39;s clean but don&#39;t expect ambience.

It&#39;s was a bit of a drive (from Oak Brook) for a late lunch but I managed to peel myself off of my work laptop to visit a family members, family&#39;s place. Does that make sense? Of course it does!

Was wanting a plate of the infamous &#34;Corundas&#34; (which I used always have to as a child visiting my family in Zinapecuaro, Michoacan) but they&#39;re were out. -_-

Instead I DEVOURED a plate of enchiladas, two tacos de cabeza (beef head tacos) and slurped a large hibiscus tea drink. ALL was great! 

Be careful with the green salsas (both of them), they have a nice bite!

Next time I want to try their tortas, to see if they bring back childhood memories too! :)"

The other, not to be named, Mexican restaurant is always filled with white customers and makes equally bland food.

I love this place. The taco menu is the best. It is a pleasant surprise to order a vegetarian taco and for it to be filled with the most delicious pepper and onion blend and no cheese. Lots of yummy options here, and at $1.50 a taco, very inexpensive for the delicous food that they make. Very satisfying."

It has that small restaurant in a wall appearance but great on flavors and service.  One of my favorite things that they do is they place a side of grilled onions with the tacos.  It adds so much depth and flavor to the tacos!  Ive had the tortas there as well and they were good too but the shining star is the tacos.  The desebrada is a favorite of mine and my only complaint is that they do not offer in hard shell.  But other then that is AWESOME!!!

There are some interesting items on the menu here and although the place is small and lacking in ambiance it certainly lacks no character.  You may find yourself out of place if you do not speak Spanish as very little English is spoken here if any.  

The food is always well seasoned and very reasonably priced.  One of my favorite dishes is called Corundas.  It consists of Tamale dumplings with a chile braised pork and topped with Mexican crema.  It is unlike anything I&#39;ve ever had but I would compare it to an inside-out tamale.  The taco&#39;s are made with regular corn tortillas and the variety is good as should be expected.  On weekends you can find Menudo which is a treat.  My wife usually gets the chicharron burrito which I find to be outstandingly delicious but I worry about the fat content - it is not for the faint of heart.

Don&#39;t go here expecting a fine dining experience.  It is a classic taqueria with very good menu options including Tortas, Burritos, and Enchiladas.  The Horchata gets an honorable mention as one of the best in the area and there is a selection of Seafood items."

Their gyro meat is amazing and that is pretty much what I have each time I am there. My husband is a little more adventurous and he has tried most everything they offer and has yet to find anything that is &#34;bad&#34;. 
The place seems to always be clean, even when they are really busy. The staff does a great job of staying on top of their cleaning.
I adore that the TV is always on and usually on a spots program, sometimes baseball, sometimes football and occasionally wrestling. Definitely casual dining.
Their only draw back is it&#39;s a Pepsi shop and I am a Coke person, but I have taken to drinking other options than my usual Diet Pepsi.

The Eagle serves your typical Greek lunch items, gyros, pitas, etc., and also has hotdogs/hamburgers. There are many of these kinds of joints around the Chicagoland area, and especially in the Western Suburbs. 

I got the chicken pita and fries which was about $8. The pita came with lettuce and tomato. There was a decent amount of chicken, but it was so dry! It was like something my sister left in the oven too long!

The fries were pretty disappointing; there were skinny and not much flavor to them. I prefer the fat cut fresh steak fries that you get at some of the other Greek grills. 

Overall, I felt I paid too much for food that was unimpressive, and I wished I would have just eaten at home."

The inside of the restaurant is nice, clean, and spacious.  Also, I&#39;m pretty sure their granite counters are the same ones we have in our kitchen at home, good taste!!

So...you&#39;re probably wondering why this is a three star review, right?  They always forget at least one part of our to go order...fries and hot peppers on our most recent order.  We paid extra for the combo and the peppers so that was kind of frustrating.

While their customer service wasn&#39;t above and beyond, they at least understand the concept of making customers happy and putting customers first during ordering/serving.  I stopped by for a large order of cheese fries on a Monday evening and besides being delicious, I was impressed that my fries were quickly made to order.  The cooks on duty even asked me if my freshly made fries were cooked enough.  I told them I wanted them a bit crispier and there was no problem, no attitude, no snide looks - just simply made my fries crispier.  Other restaurants need to take a lesson in customer service 101 from these folks.  

Besides the tasty sides and customer service, this restaurant has a compelling history, which you can read about on the walls via a newspaper story while you&#39;re waiting for your food."

The recently renovated bathrooms, dining area, and outside parking area give the Eagle a classier look as compared to many similar establishments.  The new sign on the building gives it a more established feel as opposed to the old sign which has been removed.

One of the daily specials today was the breaded pork tenderloin sandwich with homemade soup for $5.69.  The BPT sandwich was good but not enough to make it one of my &#34;definitely get it&#34; recommendations.  Although the vegetable soup was a little spicier than I would expect, it was delicious and had the perfect amount of vegetables to liquid ratio for those who prefer their soup to have more than just water (as I do).  I definitely recommend it.

On previous visits I have enjoyed the Vienna beef hot dogs with NO KETCHUP and all the good stuff.  The polish sausage has been good as well.

They offer a good mix of choices on the menu as well as catering which you can check out here http://www.eaglerestaurantdg.com/index.html or here https://www.facebook.com/EagleRestaurant/app_157563764278358 .

The TV was located so that it could be viewed in the main dining area, but other seating is available including a small outside patio area (in season) for a quieter ambiance.
 
The location and parking are excellent for commuters whether traveling by foot, bicycle, auto, or train.  It is in an easily accessed area at Maple Avenue and Fairview Avenue near the Fairview Avenue METRA stop.

I have recommended the Eagle to family/friends.  If the Eagle were to have a specialty sandwich (or other item) that made it stand out from similar places, I would consider giving it a higher recommendation.

The large order of fries I added were completely pedestrian but were indisputably LARGE. They were shoestring sized and undoubtedly frozen. I&#39;ve read reports that you can order them extra crispy, so that may be worth a shot.

The main dining area was of a decent size and impeccably clean. 

Prices seemed a little high to me. Perhaps my gyros sandwich and large fries could have been a dollar or two cheaper. Still, given the convenience of the location and the fact that they accept credit cards make it likely that I will be back."

I usually get the greek salad with gyro meat- with no onions and light on the anchovies. Its a big salad and I like that they have some healthier options.
The chicken pita is pretty tasty and healthy. It comes with some sauteed veggies.
The gyros sandwich is small and I prefer thicker gyros meat slices so meh. 
The burger is pretty good, meaty, and nice toppings.
The fries are salty and seemed to get cold and hard fast. They&#39;re not fresh cut so meh on those too.

Bonus points for cleanliness and everyone is friendly behind the counter. My kids like this place and my dad and my father in law like to take our kids here- its that kind of a place- consistent and you know what you&#39;re getting.

Food is typical fried foods (hamburgers, dogs, fish) but they also have homemade soup.
Prices are incredibly cheap. Great kids menu too.

You order from the counter and they call your name to pick it up. Clean with enough seats for maybe 40 people.

They serve beer also.

The new owner is a little rough around the edges, but I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll warm up in time.


Definitely good for a quick bite, or cheap family meal."

I mean I tried to be optimistic about this place despite the previous reviews but they were just too trifiling about EVERYTHING. I went for a bday party and one of my gifts was a small poster (smaller than the small tables) my sister (the bday girl) needed to write on and when I tried to roll it out they were like I would have needed to reserve the table (for like  $50...I came in before 8 and got the same table for free???). And to make it so bad the hostess was so ignorant about it like they were afraid they were going to miss out on some money (yeah I said it). 

The food really was mediocre and ridiculously over priced with the exception of the calamari and chicken wings (bar food). And though I specifically asked for Makers Mark I&#39;m pretty sure I got well bourbon  (disgusting) in my Manhattan. I get what they are trying to do and I want to support local businesses but I also want to support QUALITY businesses.  I can&#39;t believe this place has been getting the same complaints for over a year with no improvement. Ridiculous.

UPDATE: The live band and dj were the ONLY reasons we stayed so long. Where by 11ish they were still insisting people sit where the hostess placed them lol. By this time the lights were off and it was clearly bar and dancing time. What in the ---? I can only assume that the only  reason this place is still in business is because there&#39;s no place for grown folks to hang in the burbs but dam...pay the money and drive ANYWHERE else."

I did reserve it for a repast, however, and there were some good parts and some bad parts.  

The good:  The owner was there and he seemed to be personable enough.  He checked on us to see if things were okay frequently and allowed us to use the sound system and projector for a slide show of memories.  

The bad:  The food was mediocre at best, and we could not cater in.  I understand that the place needs to make money, but if you are going to insist that we use your food services to cater the event, please make sure that it is top shelf.  

The ugly:  The bartender overpours severely.  I ordered a long island iced tea.  Usually I get top shelf because that makes the smoothest drink.  The first one was made with liquors from the well, and it was not good at all.  After taking a sip, I returned it to the bartender and asked her to make me one with top shelf liquor.  I offered to pay the difference in drink prices, but she informed me that she was not refunding the money for the first drink and I would have to pay for the second drink as well.  I was angry, but I decided to pay for the second drink and not cause a ruckus since I was there to honor the memory of a departed family member.  

The second drink was just as terrible.  There was no balance and it tasted nothing like a long island.  As much as she overpoured, I can see why Coop would be as indignant as he is about collecting fees for reserved table seating, cover charges, and two-drink minimums.  He is losing his SHIRT on liquor costs.  

Unless there are some significant changes, I will never go back to Coop&#39;s Den, despite the fact that thy are in walking distance."

Here&#39;s my experience:

1) The band was nice! The music and song library was superb. The band itself would get 5-Stars. 

2) We ordered wings, fried okra and mac and cheese. My wings were pretty good, but my wife&#39;s weren&#39;t cooked long enough. The fried okra was TERRIBLE. Absolutely TERRIBLE! When we bit into the okra it was still frozen in the middle. Ugh. It tasted like cornmeal.  The mac and cheese was horrible as well. Most of it was burnt edges. It looked like leftover mac and cheese from a family gathering LOL. I certainly would not recommend the food at all. 

3) Ordered the pomegranate Margarita as a drink. The flavors were right on. Kudos to the bar tender.

4) I feel horrible that I can&#39;t remember our servers name but she was good. She recommended the great drink. She was kind and genuinely sincere. But I find it very interesting that the servers don&#39;t stop back by the tables to see how everything is tasting. Especially since most of our food hadn&#39;t been touched. They know the food is horrible and if they open up that door to ask, they would be sending a lot of food back. 

5) Fire the cook and whoever came up with the menu.  I mean let him/her go immediately."

Every review below is 100% accurate so I will streamline my feedback into 5 key takeaways. 

1) There is a $5 cover charge to enter this restaurant. And the manner in which this fee is collected is quite aggressive. Those tasked with greeting guests are quite unpleasant, and have no limits in nagging patrons for the $5 fee. Why on EARTH would they charge anyone to simply enter? This should have been a red flag for me to turn right around.

2) There is a $50 charge to make a reservation. If you decide that this is just absurd and then arrive at the restaurant with a party of five or more, it&#39;s likely your entire party will not sit together. My visit to Coop&#39;s Den included a party of seven. We were sat at two booths across the aisle from each other. The reason for this was the lack of availability of tables. This was completely untrue from looking at the room, and accommodations could have been made. The unpleasant door staff made the decision not to accommodate our party. Once seated, an additional room was illuminated with plenty of tables already set for groups of eight! When we requested to be moved, we were told no because the larger tables were zoned for another waitress. And to be clear, this message was delivered by the restaurant manager/owner. Really? 

3) The service at this restaurant is terrible! After being seated, we received NO wait staff attention for close to 30 minutes. When bringing this to attention, we were told there was a &#34;miscommunication&#34; in who was assigned to our table. Once we identified our server, it took close to another 30 minutes to order and receive drinks. I could go on and on here with the lack of friendliness, attention to our needs or the simplicity of providing water for ALL those seated - not just half the party. If I did that, this review would not be digestible for anyone. 

4) I don&#39;t know where to start with the food here. What you need to know is that it&#39;s disgusting. And typically I would not make a statement like this because taste is a personal preference. In this instance I feel comfortable making the assumption that NO ONE will enjoy this food. The fish is fishy, there is no seasoning used and whatever you do AVOID the mac and cheese at all cost - seriously! 

5) Despite the lack of service or quality food - this &#34;restaurant&#34; has the NERVE to have a dress code. Gym shoes and hats are not allowed past 8pm. This rule is not widely publicized, but is veraciously impressed upon patrons. The recommendation for those wearing gym shoes is to visit Walmart for the appropriate attire. What a disaster.  

I was there to celebrate a family member&#39;s birthday. Unfortunately, the experience was ruined by Coop&#39;s Den&#39;s. If I were you, I would RUN RUN RUN as recommended by most here. 

As for you Coop, I recommend a transition in business model. One that is similar to Ed Debevic&#39;s. One in which terrible service is the goal. You&#39;ve already got it nailed - down to a science!"

I was in the Chicago area visiting my sister &amp; per her friend&#39;s suggestion we visited Coop&#39;s Den. We arrived around 7 and were immediately seated with menus. The ambiance of the place was nice with a full bar, low lights and probably good for a date night--that is if you happen to be pushing fifty. 

I was so confused of the dress code. Most were dressed in semi-cute yet casual dresses, but I saw a woman in an evening gown &amp; shawl &amp; men with suits! I guess that&#39;s how the old heads get down? Meh.

I could barely see the menu, I understand setting the mood, but if I&#39;m struggling to see the selections that are essential to getting me in a good mood then there is a problem. The waiter came promptly to take our orders &amp; I was perplexed when the waiter informed me that I could not get two order of shrimp off the pick two menu. I didn&#39;t understand how I couldn&#39;t get the substitute being that I was a paying customer, but whatever, I didn&#39;t fuss because I try to be a conformist at times.

Ordered the fish sandwich &amp; steak fries--that was a mistake. The fish was juicy, but flavorless and the tarter sauce was horrid as well. I suppose I bought my southern cuisine expectations into a place that was not up to par. Also our waiter did not keep our glasses full which was unacceptable, I understand more patrons came in, but it wasn&#39;t that busy where he couldn&#39;t refill drinks, I literally had to ask. The band was coming in, but we hightailed it out because we had no desire to party with our parents.

Lastly, that drive-thru threw me off. I&#39;ve NEVER seen a bar/lounge with a drive thru, it was so random. In short, cute place for oldies--perhaps other menu selections would&#39;ve been better. However, I was much too young and for the love of humanity please add seasoning to the food!"
coops-den-restaurant-and-lounge-bolingbrook,Joni R.,5G1tAE_dmM-FbuejUl5Aog,"Chicago, IL",0,1,1,149,2,PseorK3m9aBz_imUmmLqYQ,1.0,2014-05-25,"I wanted to write this review last night after my experience but decided to sleep on it first...yep, still had an awful experienced at Coop&#39;s...here goes. Forgive me in advance for the lengthy review. 

My friend is relocating to another state and she wanted to have drinks with her family and friends at Coop&#39;s Den. Her friend called and made reservations  for a few tables to seat about 15 guests. She was told the tables were $50 to reserve, seats up to 4 people each and we had to order drinks/food in order to keep them. However, if they noticed the tables weren&#39;t being used and it was busy they would have to take the table back and would refund $50 we paid for the table so that other patrons could sit down. Ok seems fair enough cool. 

When I arrived I noticed that the tables were just plain tables. No balloons, no special note saying farewell to my friend nothing. Ok....moving on. 

Here are the good points
1) The drinks are great and reasonably priced. 
2) The bar food is good and the wings are huge! Not a fan of big chicken wings but my friend said they were tasty. 
3) The band played for about 2 hours and they were awesome. The singer with them was great as well. The DJ really turned things up when he started playing old school and house music as well as the usual line dance jams. 

Now comes the drama. After spending close to $300 on food and 1 round of drinks, nibbling on farewell cake and listening to the band we were ready to get it in and send my friend off in a big way. I was about to order champagne and more drinks when the owner comes up and asks my farewell friend if they could take the table that wasn&#39;t being used. She said yes if no one else from her party shows up. Problem with that was people were showing up by then and also they were speaking to the wrong person. Kay and I made/ paid for the reservation so they should have asked us. They knew who we were because I introduced myself at the door and I told the waitress to ask Kay and I any questions concerning the bill..not the party girl. She wasn&#39;t aware we had purchased the tables for the night. 

Ok to wrap it all up..
1) They took the table and didn&#39;t refund the $50 for the table as promised because they felt we had used the table earlier. I said well that is not what was promised to us. I don&#39;t mind helping you( the place was packed and had been full for a while) but you really are being unreasonable and unprofessional. We also didn&#39;t have the option of keeping the table for our other guests who were now arriving. So, I decided I was not going to spend another dollar in Coop&#39;s. No bottle service for us. 

2) 2 wait staff for the entire venue! Although we received our food hot/ warm, she never came back to see if we needed anything else. She reappeared when it was time for the check. 

3) Service charge on your bill they will not remove. Now I&#39;m a pretty generous tipper so she made a little more than her service charge because it wasn&#39;t her fault they had her running around the place servicing multiple parties and delivering drinks. 

I will never returns to Coop&#39;s Den and will not recommend this place to any of my friends. I&#39;m accustomed to much better customer service and I didn&#39;t appreciate them not adhering to their policies. Just a real piss poor experience for me. But my friend had a great time and that&#39;s what really mattered."

I came here with my cousin from out of town and one of her friends who is a regular here and &#34;everybody knows her name&#34; kind of like Cheers but with better looking people. Anywhoo, the bartenders were very friendly the whole night, and even recommended things for us to try since we were first timers. My cousin ended up getting a glass of prosecco and the shrimp tempura. I got a glass of moscato and the spinach and artichoke dip. 3 people recommended it to me so I just knew it would be the best I&#39;d ever had, I&#39;m sorry to say it was not. It was too creamy for my taste and seemed to be missing some garlic. It also would&#39;ve been nice if you had the option to get chips instead of toast points. They had a live band that night (Friday) and they were thebomb.com. I believe the band was called &#34;E Minor&#34;. They really turned the place out. They sang a bunch of my old school favs and a couple of newer songs too. No one danced, but I was told by one of the regulars that the DJ and dancing doesn&#39;t get started until after 11:00. Understood. I&#39;ll make sure I come back and check that out. It&#39;s safe to say I&#39;ll be back. It&#39;s nice to finally find a local lounge, not a club, a lounge, not a bar, A LOUNGE where you can chill for hours, not get bored, eat (once you find out what to get), and have a good time with friends and other chill people from who knows where.

Imagine my surprise when my friend and I walked in and was verbally attacked by Mr. Cooper just for showing up. I did have balloons in hand for one the band members, but I was not having a party (no cake, no decorations, etc). Yet, I was subject to a 5 minute tirade about how the band invited too many people without telling him (as if they weren&#39;t going to take our money), and how the restaurant already had a couple of parties planned and there wasn&#39;t a lot of room.  He tried to usher us to go sit with another group and I explained that my friend and I was just by ourselves and were looking for a table to eat. So he finally let us sit at a bar table.  And to add insult to injury, I had called to make reservations but was told that after 8 it&#39;s first come first serve. 

All and all, like I said the music was great, the food was alright (good calamari and shrimp tempura, but the tilapia was dry and french fries cold). We spent $80 on food and drinks but I feel that will be the last time I go unless they improve the way they treat customers."

The main event was a Jazz &amp; R&amp;B band, which was great, but unfortunately we walked in on the final 12 minutes of their show. Still had to pay a cover, but only $5. We were seated almost immediately. Not going to lie, I wasn&#39;t expecting us to be one of the very few lighter skinned individuals in there. But no biggie, music was good, the owner, Lawrence Cooper was cool and we enjoyed our time. 
Specials on Saturday night were $5 any liquor shots... Anything more complicated like Irish Car Bombs or even a Vegas bomb was like $8 a piece. Good deal otherwise. They had a decent selection of beers on draft, my favorite from their menu was Blue Moon though. 
Now for the music, great!! I enjoyed the live Jazz band, which was accompanied by good vocals. That band even covered Blurred Lines by Robin Thicke, and I was impressed. Definitely a good act to catch when you can, next time I&#39;ll come earlier.
After that band though, the dance floor was opened up and, DJ John Young span some tracks you won&#39;t hear from the usual DJ. I enjoyed it though, he had an ear for a constant beat and flowing tempo.. Not your average DJ, in my opinion, he even threw down some older house music. From the looks of the girl I came with, it seemed she was feeling the music, after all, that was what we were pursuing in the first place..... For a restaurant, Coop&#39;s Den has a really good sound system. You can feel the bass like there&#39;s woofers underneath your chair.. I was seated in the center next to the bar, so that&#39;s a compliment....
My favorite thing about this place was that: everyone, from the band members, to the staff, to the owners, to the folks attending were all in such a good mood and ready to dance. I loved it. It was such a good feeling to have. 
Anyways, I rate Coop&#39;s Den 5 stars, because they were very understanding while serving us. We had ordered drinks and they didn&#39;t taste the way they should taste, so we talked to our waitress, Annette, who brought over Mr. Coop and switched out our drinks. If that&#39;s not excellent service, I don&#39;t know it is. I appreciated that they understood and were accommodating. I enjoyed this place, and am looking forward to their Blues night."

So relaxed that lunch in an empty restaurant took 25 minutes for a ten dollar burger!  Food was ok, but I was ready to walk out.  Waitress was friendly, but she spent most of her time chatting with the other employees. The exterior really does not convey what kind of place it is, in fact a woman driving by as I was about to enter asked me what kind of place it was. It does not feel inviting from the outside.  It is so low-key from the parking lot I was not even positive it was a restaurant, other than the coke logo in the window  Even a neon &#34;open&#34; sign would help.

*SLOW kitchen

Bolingbrook desperately needs non-franchise places, but if Coops does not make some changes, I fear it won&#39;t be around long.

We loved our dinner!  It was very good.  Our waitress was great (Brittany) and Mr. Cooper was very accommodating and gave us great service.  We had an awesome time too.  The band was fantastic and we danced the night away.  The DJ played a nice combination of old school/new music/line dancing/old favs.  The music was really nice throughout the night.

Very clean and comfortable. Menu was varied and prices are very reasonable. Tasty dishes. I tried the Coops Den burger (1/2 angus beef, 1/2 Italian sausage) with sweet potato fries. Presentation was good.. Had calamari for an appetizer. Not greasy like other places, but it could have been a hotter temp for my taste. 

Will need another visit for the live music. I hear there is a local band that does a &#39;mean blues&#39; set. 

The wait staff seemed very friendly and attentive. Important for a startup.  

Met the owners and wished them well. Just what the southwest suburbs need.

My husband and I visited yesterday, looking for a new place in town, and we were vastly disappointed.  We ordered the soup of the day (Italian wedding) and nothing short of a kitchen tour will convince me that it didn&#39;t come from a can.  It was Campbell&#39;s.  The mussels had absolutely no taste whatsoever, which is sad, and the accompanying bread was undercooked, just above raw, and came from Jewel or Costco.  Maybe their other specialties are good, but these were not.  It took about 20 minutes to get my husband&#39;s Miller lite, and there were only 4 people in the establishment.

She was promised the party room but was denied by the &#34;hostess&#34; or whoever that woman was. Once tables started to open my boyfriend and I moved our table closer to the group we were quickly met with disdain from the waitress.  Look lady we were not trying to stiff you and you clearly saw us relocating chill out.  The fact that you can&#39;t move around in a club/bar/restaurant is insane.  Either lighten up or change your policies regarding parties or the patrons can follow these bands somewhere else where we can more around and dance a little."

There aren&#39;t many options in Bolingbrook if you don&#39;t want to eat at a chain restaurant. I went with my 11 month old son and his father. Because its marketed as more of a nightlife establishment they didn&#39;t have a high chair (that&#39;s a negative get at least one! Especially sice you open t 11am) but the owners were super super nice and we had a great lunch. The owner/hostess even held our son so that we could eat! Where does that type of service happen!? Nowhere! The chef was also super accommodating and made a special vegan dish for my son and sliced some fresh fruit for him. I really wish they&#39;d market more as a restaurant so that more folks would visit and enjoy a meal.

I have gone in the past to listen to the live music which is awesome but I would be lying if I didn&#39;t say often the music is too (teetering on obnoxiously) loud. That&#39;s the main reason I don&#39;t go at night because you can&#39;t really have a conversation with the people you&#39;re with. I still love this place for the food however. My fav menu items are the buffalo wings, spinach salad, mushroom burger (its friggin amazing!), and the mussels.

However, the only thing note worthy on their menu are the wings.  I&#39;m not sure what their chef is attempting to achieve--some kind of Asian/fusion cuisine or something.  However, overall the food is hopelessly average. Our waitress was amazing (she usually runs the bar) She knows exactly what cocktail I want when I come in and mixes it perfectly. I fear if Coop&#39;s doesn&#39;t hire themselves a really wiz-bang young chef, they&#39;ll go out of business and that would be tragic!  I would rather spend my money at a mom &amp; pops restaurant any day of the week than some big, faceless corporate, lettuce entertain you chain.

It was very busy, full bar and majority of seating was full. Bar full of game watchers, dining room full of church goers and families. There is no partition between bar patrons and dinners, yet the volume was reasonable. The place itself was fine. They attempted to make an inexpensive interior look nice... with success. I liked the way it looked although it was rather dark for an afternoon. Lights world have been nice. It took a bit for the staff to come to our table.. We only saw 3 waitresses, and this place is rather large. Staff was helpful and friendly. We ordered a burger and the fried chicken with Mac&amp; cheese. The staff informed us the Mac was made by the owner. My hunger couldn&#39;t wait to taste it. Plate consisted of 3 PC of chicken fried in a cornmeal batter. Bland at best. There was 1 wing and 2 thighs. I don&#39;t believe this was a chicken.. It had to be a chick. The pieces.. Almost unidentifiable,  where the smallest I have ever seen, lacking meat, not just seasoning. The Mac was an even bigger disappointment. Made by the owner, it was dry, flavorless, and was lacking any creaminess...   And cheese. Truth... Worst ever. The book for lunch was 52..$.    That included one beer. There is no value.  If you want the illusion of going to a nice place without the effort or quality, but getting a decent atmosphere at an expensive price this is your place."

Reason, I can see everything and plus i am a people watcher.  Both bartenders were good (they took care of the bar and the side tables) and we had drinks, lots of laughs and ate food. We were told about all the daily events and the New Years Eve party. Food was good. Met the owners, band members and MR Audio West and his wife who attended college with me.

The best feature of Capital Grille is the service that they provide. From the host, to the waitress, bartender, even the chef, there is definitely a culture of service and hospitality that emanates the second you step through the door.

They are extremely attentive to each guest, and you will def get special treatment if you come for an occasion like a birthday or a celebration.

The steaks are of course all the rave. If you get you get your steak anything more than medium rare: SHUNNNNN. You should be ashamed!!! These are some of the most tender, dry aged steaks that I&#39;ve ever had. Go to Mcdonalds if you want well done hamburger!!!

Okay, the next thing I want to recommend is the lobster Mac n cheese. They mean it when they say lobster. It&#39;s not just little shreds of lobster, no, in Capital Grille style you will find like a whole claw!! And the cheese they use is a wonderful sharp cheddar and some other kind blended in that I couldn&#39;t distinguish. Oh, and they put these magnificent buttery bread crumbs in there too!! 

Trust me. This is some of the best Mac n cheese you will ever have. 

I have had other sides too that are also awesome, like the Brussel sprouts or the mashed potatoes. I don&#39;t believe there&#39;s one thing that&#39;s so-so on the menu.

This place is also nice if you just want to hang out at the bar, watch some sports, and get wine and bread and oysters. It&#39;s a good break for something like that vs. just going to a local dive. Fancy it up man!! 

I highly recommend Capital Grille. Go, absolutely, and get a big Porter House steak!!"

I&#39;ve been to Gibson&#39;s &amp; Hugo Frog, so Capital was the last on the list, but I&#39;ve wanted to come here for quite awhile now (several years) so since today was the last day for restaurant week in Chicago I came in for lunch. The lunch menu is $22.00. Not bad &amp; they offered 4 different entree selections. I ended up ordering from their regular lunch menu because I wanted a bone-in strip and it was reasonably priced for a 14oz lunch dish. It was served with mashed potatoes. The food was received rather quickly, maybe that&#39;s why my potatoes were luke warm (not hot as I prefer). My steak was perfectly cooked. It was more on the med side than med rare side as requested, but it was still very enjoyable. It was a nice decent size. I did have to add salt  (doesn&#39;t seem like they use any). 4 of 5 on the food. 

Now on to the service, our server was Sue G. (I won&#39;t blast her last name, even though they provide cards with it). Sue was pleasant, she got the order correct, but she also didn&#39;t seem genuine and she seemed rather rushed &amp; kinda of curt w/us. I&#39;d give her 3 of 5 stars honestly. Overall I&#39;d go back, not rushing though."

Food: 4/5 stars
We ordered the spicy calamari to share, Porterhouse medium rare, porcini (kona?) rubbed ribeye with a balsamic glaze cooked medium, lobster mac and cheese, and Sam&#39;s mashed potatoes. On the house: shrimp cocktail and dessert flight

Spicy Calamari: 3/5 it was spicier than expected. The peppers sprinkled it gave it a nice kick but the sauce made it soggier than I would like. I liked the flavors but not so much the texture. 

Porcini rubbed ribeye: 3/5 It was too charred for my taste giving it a burnt flavor that was contrasted by the slightly sour balsamic vinegar. Not my cup of tea. I&#39;m a purest, I just don&#39;t like overpowering rubs on my steak. 

Porterhouse: 5/5 This was my first time ordering a porterhouse and I didn&#39;t quite know what to expect. My first bite was kinda chewy and slightly dry and then I realized my porterhouse came out medium on one side and well done on the other. Seth, our server, quickly rectified the situation and brought me out a shrimp cocktail to nibble on while I waited. The next porterhouse had me in tears it was so good. It was cooked to perfection, just the right amount of char and perfectly medium rare. It was so tender and so juicy I was so excited and am converted. 

Lobster mac and cheese: 3/5 to be honest, I&#39;m not a lobster fan but I do love the flavor it imparts on carbs. The mac and cheese was good albeit skimpy on the lobster pieces. But for $18, we can&#39;t really expect a whole lobster I guess. The noodles and the breading had a good texture but the flavor was okay. 

Mashed potatoes: 4/5 holy butter and heavy cream batman! They were exactly the way mashed potatoes at a steakhouse should be: creamy, buttery and oh so bad for you. The perfect accouterment to steak. I wish it had another flavor mixed in there such as garlic. 

Shrimp cocktail: 5/5 My favorite dish of the night. That cocktail sauce is on point! I wanted to drink it, it was so good. The shrimp was perfectly cooked and was perfectly complimented by that delightful cocktail sauce.  

Birthday dessert flight: 4/5 blood orange sorbet, salted caramel gelato, berry compote, flourless chocolate cake with a sugarless whipped cream and creme br√ªl√©e cheesecake. Hands down my favorite was the blood orange sorbet! I&#39;m not a sorbet person because it&#39;s usually too sweet but this was the perfect amount of sweetness contrasted by the tartness. The consistency was a little thicker than a slurpee so basically perfect. The salted caramel gelato melted fairly quickly and was pretty sweet. It had a nice flavor but sweeter than I typically enjoy in gelato. The strawberry and blueberry compote was delightful. The cheesecake was good but a little bit heavy tasting after steak. The texture was light and creamy. I&#39;m a not a chocolate eater so the flourless chocolate cake tasted like it always does? (I know I&#39;m terrible, who doesn&#39;t enjoy lobster and chocolate) 

Service: 6/5 stars
I had noted on my reservation that it was my birthday and they decorated my table with rose petals and a signed happy birthday note. We had Seth as our server and he was attentive, nice and charming. He was really attentive and funny albeit slightly absentee (probably because he had tables in a different room). He quickly rectified my well porterhouse by quickly bringing me a shrimp cocktail while my dinner companion dined on his ribeye. That was an absolutely nice touch and I was pleasantly surprised! The manager brought out my new porterhouse and asked me to cut into it to make sure it was the correct temperature. He even went as far as to bring out new mashed potatoes to ensure I had a hot side to enjoy with my delicious steak. I was a little sad that they didn&#39;t clean the bread crumbs off the table and I was staring at my own mess the entire time. 

Ambiance: 3/5 
Looks like an old boys clubhouse, there was a giant painting of a random man on wall staring at me the entire night. The lighting is dim and the walls are wood if I remember correctly. Not a fan. 
 
I will definitely be back for my next special occasion. 

tl;dr pretty good steakhouse to visit if you don&#39;t want to make the trip into the city."

As you know, when you participate in Restaurant Week, there is a pre-determined menu at a value price of $33 or $44 for dinner!  YOU CAN NOT BEAT THAT FOR THE DINING EXPERIENCE AT THE CAPITAL GRILLE.

The Capital Grille in Lombard is an intimate setting, with warm wood color tones, vintage portraits hanging on the walls, dim lights,  and candles adorning all tables. We were seated in the dining room with a full wall of wine,  reminiscent of a basement cellar.  The other side of the room featured a view of the stainless steel kitchen and white-clad chefs.

This evening my dinner company was my lovely, young daughters.  We were offered the opportunity to order from the Capital Grille&#39;s regular menu or opt for the Chicago&#39;s Restaurant Week menu. The waitress was kind enough to inform us the Restaurant Menu items were an exact replication of what you would receive if ordering the same item from their regular menu (stating many places offer something different for the Restaurant Week).  The girls and I selected the Filet Mignon/ Shrimp Dinners with Clam Chowder, Potatoes,  Spinach, and Creme Brulee for dessert. 

All were delicious.  The Clam Chowder was a perfect creamy blend, with just the right amount of Clam chunks.  The Filets were cooked perfectly to meet our wellness requests AND seasoned nicely!  The potatoes were smooth and buttery.  The green beans may have been the best I have ever had! Finally, the Creme Brulee was sweet and accompanied with delicious berries.

Ambiance was great. Service was superb. And, our food was exquisite!"

I decided to treat my girlfriend here for a Birthday dinner last month....reservations were made for a Saturday evening and arriving on time, we were promptly seated (by a handsome Host). Dressed to the nines, we were eagerly anticipating an evening of carnivorous indulgence...yes, we wanted to look extra special for the lustful meat we were about to meet...Having perused the menu online the day of, I already knew what I wanted walking in....

I&#39;ve been here a few times, but it had been awhile since I returned...white tablecloths, Server&#39;s with polished attire, the large staircase leading up to the second floor...an aura of refinement with old world charm. There is nothing trendy or modern about the d√©cor here..

Tablets displaying wine &amp; drink selection was new to me...didn&#39;t have that the last time I was here.  We placed drink orders upon being greeted by our informative and attentive Server. I forewent my usual glass of wine and planned a night of vodka gimlets...oh gimlet how I missed thee (potent)...An assortment of fresh bread was brought out first. We went with the Wedge and Shaved Brussel sprout salads for starters...
Because of my compulsion for variety, I had to restrain myself...(yes, I was eyeballing the oysters on the half-shell, but quickly told self I&#39;d make a visit to Shaw&#39;s for 1/2 off oyster night instead).

Loved the blue cheese dressing on the Wedge which was crisp, filling &amp; bacony.  The sprouts were flavorful and had a great bite, I happen to love Brussel sprouts...we both shared these and thoroughly enjoyed.
But let&#39;s be honest, the star of the show here was the Meat...

I had my heart set on the Bone-In Ribeye (22 oz.) cooked med-rare.  She ordered the 10 oz. Filet.  We shared sides of mashed potatoes and roasted cauliflower (yum &amp; yum). 

Can I just say that my nicely marbled brontosaurus cut of meat was perfectly cooked, juicy, hot, flavorful and faultless in every way?  If only I had Fred Flintstone&#39;s bottomless pit...Every bite was savored.  The potatoes were creamy &amp; dreamy and the roasted cauliflower was nicely caramelized with sherry vinegar which made these taste so incredibly good...in fact, I will have to make this myself....My friend LOVED her Filet as well....there were moments when we ceased all conversation in mid sentence, just so we could focus on feasting....nothing was more important than the plates in front of us at that moment..

Service from beginning to end was flawless.  It was definitely a busy night, but the timing of each dish was on par.  Suffice to say, we were oinking by the end of our meal...and no, I did not / could not finish my sublime steak.  We weren&#39;t interested in dessert, so I can&#39;t comment..

It was a stellar night, with stellar company...It was all about the memorable food, atmosphere and experience...

There are many great steakhouses in this vicinity, Oak Brook being one of them...
While I&#39;d typically order a steak, I&#39;d love to try the Chilean Sea Bass w/Mushroom soy in the future...I always feel sinful eating Chilean bass...and I have a hunch it&#39;s great here..

When you want that oomph...and a more upscale, polished atmosphere...Capital Grille is high on my list.....if you can still make it for Restaurant Week, I say do it.."

Going with that, I had artichoke bisque, steak frites with chimichurri , and a grapefruit soda. I think that soup was the most stellar part of the meal. Creamy but not excessively so, with browned mushrooms as a garnish. The steak was somewhat overdone- more medium than medium well, and the combo of chimichurri and fried shoestrings was, well, greasy. Service was top notch as always and if you are on a business lunch or other tight schedule, they make sure you are on your way in timely fashion."

Once for a private party, which was a company dinner in a private room, once for a yelp event and this most recent visit was for Restaurant Week. The Capital Grille is one of the best values for Restaurant Week, and the menu is in line with the regular menu. 

They have tablets with all the drink options, wines, tasting notes, prices and other information. I could have scrolled through that forever. Particular about your bourbons? You can see all the varieties Capital Grill has to offer. I never before knew that there are affordable, reasonable bottle of wine on the Capital Menu. 

Four of us went out and of course we opted into the $33pp pre-fix. We had wedge salads, Cesar salads and chowder. All were excellent. We had filets, a 14oz NY Strip and the salmon. The sides were green beans and potatoes. I love skin on mashed potatoes. The salmon had some tasty nuts on the plate, not sure what they were but they were excellent. The strip steak was perfect.

Desserts were a choice of cr√®me brulee and chocolate cake. I had the cr√®me brulee, it had a light vanilla flavor and a ton of berries on top. 

Service was impeccable. 

I need to make sure we come back. This is a good place."

I had wanted to go to Capital Grille for a long time and I did so during Chicago Restaurant Week. We sat at a corner table in the lounge, right under a painting of Harry Caray. Also, right next to two screaming kids, but that&#39;s not on the restaurant. I liked that they had tablets on the table to select our wine options. I enjoyed a nice glass of Malbec for $10.

The bread basket was nice, with different choices, although I got pretty hooked on those seeded rolls. I even asked for, and received, a couple of extras. The clam chowder was pretty solid, not too thick, not too thin. My companion was not overly impressed with the wedge salad as it was pretty small. The 18 ounce bone in strip with the Kona coffee crust and shallot butter was so mixed. The Kona seasoning was one of the best flavors I&#39;ve ever had on steak. Smoky, spicy, and sweet. I would buy that seasoning if I could. But we asked for medium-rare steaks and they both came out quite rare. Also, we weren&#39;t thrilled with having to choose between mashed potatoes and green beans; it would have been nice to have small portions of both instead.

Dessert was really nice, I had an amazing creme brulee. The top shell wasn&#39;t overly crispy and hard, it blended nicely into the custard. the fresh berries on top were a nice accompaniment. However, my companion did not care for the chocolate espresso cake at all.

Service was very friendly. However, between the two restaurant week meals, three glasses of wine, and a coffee, the bill was $132 before tip. It was a pretty good experience, but I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d want to come back to this particular location."

But let&#39;s be real. It is WAY overpriced. And there are pretty much 0 vegetarian options, which sucks. I&#39;m not a vegetarian, but I&#39;ve been here with one and not only did the restaurant have to make her a dish out of thin air, but they messed the dish up too.

My advice would be to add a vegetarian/vegan dish to the menu. 

Additionally, the steaks are good, but you can get them better at other places. For instance, Wildfire in both Schaumburg and in Oakbrook has better filets. They are also cheaper. 

The plus side of this place is good service, good food, and amazing decor. I think besides this price and lack of vegetarian options, this place is close to perfect. Well done."

I have celebrated big events and enjoyed a simple night out at steak houses both in the city and suburbs. These include, but are not limited to, Chicago Cut, Mortons, Gibsons, Hugos, and Ruths Chris. Capital Grille hangs in there easily with the top tier steak houses in the Chicago area. Tonight I was treated to dinner by my lovely mother for my birthday. The highlight was by far the steak-I had the filet with Kona rub and shallot butter. **Note that you can request any preparation for any steak even if it does not list it that way on the menu.** I should say that I now only want to eat steak and possibly all other proteins with a Kona rub and shallot butter... If only. We also had roasted fingerling potatoes and roasted wild mushrooms. Both were excellent. Their wine list is extensive although more limited for choices by the glass. we found great choices at fairly reasonable price points for the offerings. The dessert was cheese cake with a brulee top and fresh berries along with some coffee, again both superb. My only dislike was the salad. We both had the spinach salad with bacon dressing and were quite underwhelmed. That&#39;s a pass for me next time. However, I don&#39;t go out to a steak house for the salad and the rest of the meal and service was so great that it&#39;s still clearly a five star rating for me! Skip the salad and add an extra green veg for dinner or go with the lobster bisque as a starter and enjoy that shallot butter sauce!!"

Considering a glass of wine could go for $12, it really is a great deal! The wedge salad s a great start and the cold seafood plate appetizer has amazing oysters!

As far as slabs of cow flesh go, Capital Grill is a class act and amongst the best around.   Solid, dependable and consistently above average. Typical steakhouse decor. Greg are sever took care of us well.

Since all meat taste pretty much the same tip me unless it&#39;s seasoned, I went for the Chefs recommendation, a Gorgonzola, Truffle slab of NY Strip.  Tasted like, gorgonzola, Truffle and meat.

Our server was a really nice guy, and when he showed up at our table, he immediately noticed and addressed any issues like empty water glasses. But the periods between visits could be lengthy. He actually seemed to take really good care of the table next to us who were seated a short while after us, so that was nice for them. My water glass sat empty for a while, but I watched the table next to us get half-empty glasses filled and the pitcher put away, before the server grabbed them something else. 10 minutes later or so, I was able to get some water too. It took us over 45 minutes from finishing our meal to getting our leftovers boxed and paying the bill, which I know because I watched the clocks on their wall with interest while we sat around waiting. 

Our neighbors received hot towel service at the end of their meal. I don&#39;t know, we weren&#39;t offered that. I guess I should be glad that I didn&#39;t have to start walking up to random employees trying to run my card so we could leave without dining and dashing. 

We weren&#39;t fussy about it at all, and it truly didn&#39;t get tiresome until that last long wait at the end of the meal. 

The food overall was good to great. Much as I love asparagus, I wasn&#39;t crazy with their take on it. We enjoyed our steaks, which were cooked to perfection.  The martinis were good. I&#39;m not sure there was anything I had that I&#39;m desperate to come back and try again, though sounds like we missed ordering some of the specialties like the lobster mac and cheese."

They offer complimentary valet which is great seeing you&#39;d have to park preset far from the door...it was crowded. 

The ambiance was dark, loud, and classy. It appeared most of the patrons were having business meetings or a night out with the spouse. This place didn&#39;t look family friendly, I didn&#39;t see any children. 

The staff was pleasant including the two managers that checked on our table. Our waiter was more than happy to answer all of my questions. The menu options were slightly minimum but good and also pricey...be prepared to spend at least $175.  I settled on the African Lobster Tail and Bone-In Ribeye. The food was great and so was the wine selection. I will return but I want to check out the city location next."

I just make eye contact with any of the staff members and they come over. I did on accident a couple times and had to say I didn&#39;t need anything! LOL

They will talk to you depending on your mood and response. Which is clever and attention to detail. Sometimes being too chatty is not a good thing. It comes off as intruding and ruins someone&#39;s intimate experience. Yet being too quiet comes off as careless and uninviting.  Not everyone understands the balance between the two, they do!

As for steaks, they cooked mine, on point! Every Time!!

This past Friday we had reservations at Hugo Frog&#39;s in Des Plaines, but it started pouring rain right before we were about to leave and it was rush hour. We both decided that fighting the traffic wasn&#39;t going to be worth it, so as we were driving down Butterfield we had a sudden change of plans. We quickly opened up OpenTable and started seeing where we could get in immediately. The choices were The Capital Grille and Gibson&#39;s (pretty darn good choices). Since we&#39;ve been to Gibson&#39;s numerous times, we decided to give Capital Grille a go!

As I said before, it was a rainy Friday night and it was still rather early, around 6pm or so. We were sat right away at a table tucked back in the corner. There were several open tables, but they must have been reserved, because we were pushed into the corner. We&#39;re not really picky about seating, but it was a bit crammed. 

Our server came right away and went over drinks (on an iPad). The bread was warm and delicious and the drinks were reasonably priced and delicious. 

We ordered Lobster/Crab Cakes as an appetizer and they were absolutely wonderful. This is our goto and we certainly were not disappointed.

For the main course I ordered the 10oz Filet and my Fianc√© went with the Seared Tenderloin with Lobster Tails. We also went with asparagus and au gratin potatoes as sides.

My Filet was a bit undercooked, but still very good. Her tenderloin was VERY undercooked and she really didn&#39;t enjoy it much, especially for the price. She did however enjoy the lobster tails, she said those were delicious. The asparagus was good, but not great. And the au gratin potatoes were not very good at all.

In total, we ordered a bottle of wine and two of their higher end menu items with two sides. The bill came out to about $250, not including tip. It was a very average meal, and I&#39;d certainly pick Gibson&#39;s, Hugo&#39;s, or Joe&#39;s over this if I had to do it again."

Our server was also a trained sommelier, able to make recommendations on the wine list even though half the  group went with their special wine flight. 7 wines with some from the special reserve list paired well with seafood for appetizers and steaks for dinner. The rare tuna with mango and sriracha sauce was amazing, and I do not like sriracha. It was flavorful but subdued. My filet was cooked perfectly and the others in mg party enjoyed theirs as well. Out of our side dishes, my favorites were the lobster mac and cheese which used a very mild white cheddar, along with the soy sauce and bacon glazed brussel sprouts. A flourless chocolate cake and creme brulee cheesecake finished off the exquisite night. I will definitely be returning her on my next special occasion."

I would treat myself to the lollipop lamb chops every 6 months after having MRI/CT scans at the Chicago location near Northwestern Hospital. This past visit, I ordered the chops medium rare. They came out medium well. The waiter noticed the chops were overcooked and brought out perfectly cooked chops within minutes. After dinner, the manager came to apologize and not only took care of the problem, but comped the meal in celebration of good health.

Several years ago, when I was a younger, more foolish man, I forgot my wedding anniversary.  In a panic, I called the Capital Grille in Lombard and asked if they had any private dining options - the events planner said they had a private room, but it was not very intimate.  As an alternative, she said she could &#34;fence off&#34; a booth in the corner of the bar and ensure we had at least a table or two buffer, so we could dine more privately.  I made the reservation, and when we arrived, we were greeted with complimentary flutes of champagne, and a candle-lit table covered in rose petals!

Don&#39;t be fooled by the old money decorations, though!  When it came time to ask for the type of Whiskey they offer, our server gave us her ipad that lists only best of the best: Blanton&#39;s, Regis, Booker Noe, Basil Hayden...Appetizers, sides and dinner were all amazing!

At the end of the night, your car is already started and all warmed up for you, which can be advantageous to us Chicagoans come the harsh winters!

In late November, I took my wife to celebrate her birthday at the capital grill. As soon as we arrived at the restaurant we had the pleasure to meet our server, Davis Jaye. 

Davis was and is what every server should strive to be. He was very kind and very informative. He knew the food and wine menus thoroughly. He made outstanding recommendations and we noticed that he wasn&#39;t just giving his full and divine attention to us but to all of his tables. 

Needless to say, my experience at the capital grill was a positive one. The food was delicious and the service was extraordinary.

Next time, we go to the capital grille we hope to receive the same service and consistency by both the kitchen and the serving staff."

I always read yelp reviews so I had high expectations that our dinner experience would be fantastic. Capital Grill did not disappoint. First, our server&#39;s name was Tony and he was terrific, very knowledgeable about the menu and very personable. Some servers can be robotic but Tony was great. On to the food: I had the tuna tartare as the appetizer and the scallops as the main course. The tuna was amazing, my favorite thing about the meal. The scallops...well, they were good and the mushroom risotto was very good but a couple of the scallops had a bit of grittiness, like they weren&#39;t rinsed enough. This was the only thing a bit off. My husband loved the French onion soup and his porterhouse steak which was cooked perfectly. The portions are so huge that we both brought home quite a bit of our entrees. They treated us to champagne and dessert since we were celebrating our anniversary which was very nice! We will definitely be back again, maybe Christmas Eve."

I must say the menu looked great, but the dishes were just average -- nothing that blew me away.

The clam chowder was good. The salmon was a flavorless and dry, but I liked the toasted almonds and green beans that accompanied it. I stole a truffle fry from a colleague, and must say the fries were pretty good. The flourless chocolate espresso cake was very dense and rich, but the creme brulee was better.

The service was above average, as expected from a more upscale place. I would not be opposed to returning and trying some of the other things on the menu, but I expected much better."

It was pretty busy for a Tuesday evening, but we were able to get a reservation in couple hours before we dined. We got there a little early, and hung out at the bar. My co workers and I got one of their signature drinks - not sure what it is called but it&#39;s pineapple with Stoli. this stuff is pretty strong. I gave most of it to my co-worker to finish. The bartender was really nice. When we went to the dining area for dinner, our waitress was very helpful and super friendly. All 4 of us really liked her and the service she provided to us. Her name is Lindsey Glosniak and when we go next time, we&#39;re definitely going to ask for her! Her service and explanation of the menu to us was excellent!

We started out with the grand plateau. This was a delicious appetizer. Two tiers of seafood. The bottom tier was of shrimp and oysters. The top tier was of lobster and crab. Really enjoyed it. We thought it was going to be a lot of food, but we devoured it. For entree I ordered the porcini delmonico steak. My boss ordered that, too. One co worker ordered the gorgonzola and truffle steak, and another ordered the porterhouse steak. The porterhouse steak is 24oz. Our delmonico steak is 22oz, and the gorgonzola and truffle steak is 14oz. It was so much steak! Most of  us didn&#39;t finish it, and they gave it to me to take home for the leftovers which still tasted good after reheating it in the oven. The flavor and texture was just like how it was when it came out the night after. We ended the night with creme  brulee and coconut pie to share with the table. Both desserts were really good, but we all felt the creme brulee was the best. 

We had quite a long dinner, but it was very filling and delicious. It is a 5 stars in my books."

Maybe I am just an old school type of guy. If people want to call me that, then I am guilty, as charged. With that said, I just believe that some things just need to stay &#34;old school&#34; because &#34;old school&#34;, sometimes, is the easier road to travel.

The food was outstanding. However, the service was a little slow. The first thing was the, for a lack of a better term, the &#34;Ipad&#34; drink menu. I get it; we live in a world of technology now. However, things would have been a little easier with just a regular wine/cocktail menu that we could read before the server comes over. Also, when we were seated, we didn&#39;t receive the &#34;Ipad&#34; drink menu, so when the server came over to ask us what we wanted to drink, we had to ask for the drink menu. She looked at us like something was wrong with us; I guess she couldn&#39;t believe that we didn&#39;t know the &#34;Ipad&#34; drink menu by heart. Then, it took her about 10 - 15 minutes to bring us the &#34;Ipad&#34; drink menu, which, of course, made our dining experience longer than it should have been.

Again, the food is excellent. However, our server was painfully slow. It took her forever to check in on us, bring us drinks, etc., but I would definitely go back for the food."

I took my Aunt and my 3 teenage kids here tonight to celebrate my oldest daughter&#39;s high school graduation. When I made the reservation,  I mentioned what it was for. When we sat down, our table had rose petals on it and a card signed by the staff for my daughter!

We were promptly greeted by David Heidorn, who was the very best server I have ever had the pleasure of meeting....what a GEM!!! He made us feel so welcome! He patiently and very thoroughly went over the menu with us. My daughter (the graduate) was in the mood for a great burger and was disappointed there were none on the menu.  David fixed that for her by speaking with the chef, and she was able to eat &#34;the best burger EVER!&#34; on her special day.

My son had the lobster tail, my aunt had salmon and my other daughter and I had filet mignon. We shared mashed potatoes and scalloped potatoes. We unanimously agreed it was our Best.Meal.EVER!

What took our experience over the top was the service.  We aren&#39;t seasoned fine-diners, but we were certainly treated that way. David brought us complimentary mini teacups of lobster bisque while we waited for our food. It was so delicious! Every staff person we encountered was so pleasant, it just really made our experience so great.

Did I mention the service was phenomenal? :-) As a final touch, David brought out a beautiful dessert tray of creme brulee, mini cheesecakes and mini flourless chocolate cakes....and said it was &#34;on the house&#34; to celebrate my daughter&#39;s graduation!! It was absolutely a 5 star experience and one we won&#39;t soon forget!!"

While our 12:30 reservations didn&#39;t actually get us seated until closer to 1:30, it did give my mom and I a chance to try their Stoli Doli- a signature martini that is simply Stolichnaya vodka infused with pineapple for 7 days, which was amazingly smooth and subtly sweet. 
   The buffet itself was laid out in 2 sections: the first being the breakfast/ raw bar/ dessert line, and the second the salad/ lunch/ carving station. Breakfast consisted of serviceable scrambled eggs and Lyonnaise pan-fried potatoes, but very nicely cooked and flavorful bacon, sausage, pancakes, and French toast. We didn&#39;t partake of the raw bar, but it included smoked salmon, shrimp, and oysters. 
   The lunch buffet items included mac and cheese that was not very cheesy but surprisingly delicious, creamy and well-seasoned mashed potatoes, and citrus glazed salmon and roast chicken that were both decent but not the stars of the show. That honor goes to the kona-rubbed tenderloin steak: I can&#39;t stress enough that this is what you want to save your valuable gastric real estate for- I would have spent the entire price of entry just for this dish (which is exactly what you&#39;d pay to order it off the menu any other time). The seasoning on this coffee-crusted meat is so unique and unexpected, and the tenderness was absolutely perfect at either level of doneness I had (I tried it at medium and medium rare). They also had ham at the carving station which was fine, but once you try the steak you&#39;ll regret giving up that bit of space for something lesser.
   We also ordered several items from the kitchen: a cheese omelette (ever so slightly runny, but still good), cheeseburger sliders (very good), and truffle fries (also very good). That being said, just try that kona steak- you really won&#39;t be as happy with anything else.
   The dessert table was an enormous surprise, as I&#39;ve been consistently underwhelmed with buffet desserts- while usually pretty to look at, they just aren&#39;t usually that tasty. The espresso flourless chocolate cake was the clear winner here, but the br√ªl√©e cheesecake and key lime pie bites (seemed more like key lime cheesecake) were fantastic, as well. They also had cream puffs, cake pops, chocolate cookies, and a variety of cupcakes, but just don&#39;t waste the space on these.
   The Capital Grille appears to exude class in all things, from the hostess to the bartender and waiter, from the restaurant decor to the rose petals on the table- highly enjoyable and worth the price of admission.
   That steak."

The bread basket always provides a wide variety of choices and is delicious. I got the smoked salmon appetizer as a starter and I&#39;ve said it before, but it&#39;s one of the best things I have EVER eaten. I then got the filet, cooked well done and it was perfect. I shared the twice baked potato with my mom, they actually cut it into 3 pieces which was nice. Brussel Sprouts were amazing, but I actually didn&#39;t like the bacon that came with it. The pieces were huge and fatty. I know it&#39;s for flavor, but still.

We really enjoy dining out and while service can definitely make or break a review, we thought the food just didn&#39;t justify better than a 3 star rating. There was nothing wrong with our steaks, they were cooked well, but they seemed to be lacking some seasoning. We actually preferred the steaks at Wildfire, which I feel are always seasoned well and cooked exactly right. The sides weren&#39;t very memorable either. I&#39;m not sure if perhaps it was just an off night? As I said, the service was wonderful--a table was set up with rose petals and our server took a souvenir photo for us, which was a very thoughtful gesture. The complementary dessert WAS delicious, though, and very much appreciated! We might come back again for another special occasion."

We&#39;ve eaten at the nearby Rock Bottom a couple of times, and neither of us really likes the menu there, so I mentioned the Capital Grille. Used to eat at the one off the Mass Pike outside Boston all the time. 

Our server was Gene, who I would not call a &#34;waiter.&#34; Not that there&#39;s anything wrong with being a waiter, but Gene was more like a tour guide of our options. Slick enough to be a software salesman, but almost too sincere for that. He had all the specials, and the answers to our questions, right in the front of his head. Witty guy, snappy service, a guy you&#39;d wanna steal if you were starting your own restaurant. 

I&#39;ve had the wedge before, for salad, and it&#39;s great, but it&#39;s huge, and I wanted to save room for some red meat. 

I got a Cosmo, partner got an Appletini. He had surf and turf, steak and lobster tail, and I had a bone-in filet. INCREDIBLE. We shared some grilled asparagus as well. THAT was so good that even after dessert, I munched on it til it was gone.

I hardly ever finish a whole steak, and I destroyed mine, it was that good. After dinner, he had creme brulee, and I had the homemade ice cream and a Grand Marnier. 

I inquired with Gene about bringing my wife for our anniversary, and he instantly gave me the lowdown on what they could do for me, so it&#39;s on the agenda. 

It was fairly quiet,so we could chat about business and family. The atmosphere is kind of formal, and in fact we were the sloppiest people in there. The bar was crowded, otherwise we&#39;d have eaten in there. But the tables were just fine. 

The CG is never cheap, but unlike SOME over-priced places, the money is on the screen (as they say about big movies). Definitely worth the cash. They have valet parking, but there&#39;s always plenty of space, since it&#39;s on the fringe of Yorktown Mall. Stupendous experience, great food, great service. Give Gene a raise."

I can&#39;t recall having a better Lobster bisque in my life!  They pour a solid drink in which you pay accordingly. The ribeye is always a solid bet. I actually enjoy that it&#39;s not over charred like so many other joints. My gut sometimes doesn&#39;t enjoy eating straight char with a little meat. I drink my desert, so no input there except I highly recommend a Moscow Mule since it balances out a heavy meal perfectly. The atmosphere is definitely a well healed drinkers country club. I&#39;m sure many business deals have been closed here. If you need a deal closed, then call me and give your credit card and I&#39;ll take care of it! cheers"

First, the service is out of this world. Seth is one of the best servers ever. EVER. And as you can see by my review history, I have plenty of experience to say this with conviction. He&#39;s friendly, efficient, makes the kids laugh, always has great recommendations.  He&#39;s just wonderful. You feel like he genuinely cares about your experience there. 

Second, the food is so delicious. My favorite is the Kona Rubbed Ribeye with Shallot Butter. I&#39;ve never had anything even remotely close to it. They always cook it perfectly. Sides are ala carte which is not unusual for a steakhouse. The mashed potatoes are wonderful. My husband is a fan of the shrooms. 

The appetizers are also great. They have a seafood tower - seriously who doesn&#39;t like a seafood tower? But the best of all are the shrimp. They are large - they are fresh - they are great. 

Our favorite dessert is the Cr√®me Brulee cheesecake. The crust is made from Nilla Wafers. Yes, Nilla Wafers. I can&#39;t even describe how good these are. 

It&#39;s a special occasion restaurant because of the price point - but once you go, you&#39;ll be hooked."

Food- Started off with the assortment of fresh bread.  It came with flat pita and sourdough which didn&#39;t try, but I did try the pumpernickel rye and baked onion bread, both of which were great.  I got the baked  French onion soup, and my dad got the spinach salad with bacon dressing.  I didn&#39;t try the salad, but the baked French onion soup was delicious.  I really liked that they maintained the consistency of the bread, because usually when I order French onion soup, the bread is all soggy and gross.  For sides we got the creamed spinach and au gratin potatoes.  The creamed spinach was delicious, very creamy, but not to bitter and not to rich.  The potatoes were also great, also creamy and extremely rich(which is good). For dinner I had the porterhouse and my dad had the kona crusted steak.  The porterhouse was perfect.  One side was a juicy strip that made me feel like a real man eating it, and the other a finer filet, with just the right fat content to give it that melt in your mouth flavor.  My dads kona steak was pretty good, but I&#39;m not a big fan of the kona rub, it tastes a little too charred to me.  

Service- The service was fantastic.  Came in at five on Saturday and sat right down.  Our waitress was terrific, constantly refilling drinks and actual had a decent conversation with us.  The 3-4 managers all checked in with us periodically to make sure all was well.  

Definitely would come back for a special occasion, but a bit too expensive for a normal weekend dinner."

Split the traditional burger.  Absolutely fabulously cooked. Excellent taste and wonderful presentation. Kudos. First time to Lombard. If we are ever back here, we will stop in again for sure."

When I go to Chicago Cut, Ruth&#39;s Chris, or other equally famous steak places, I&#39;m much more satisfied with the balance of flavors, the quality of food, etc.  Every time I&#39;ve been to Capital Grille, I just say, &#34;meh&#34; in my mind.

I hate to be picky, but I just find their food a bit flavorless.  There is a sweetness in a lot of the dishes, too, that I would expect to be more savory.  For example, the Au Gratin Potatoes almost tasted like a dessert it was so sweet.

Just didn&#39;t blow me away for the price paid.  I know everyone has opinions.  Mine is to avoid this and spend your money elsewhere I hate to say."

Okay I&#39;m not even 3 decades old, but my Capital Grille, how I love thee. Thee friendliest, thee ambiance, thee service, especially thee food!

I&#39;ve been to this location a handful of times and always received impeccable service! I always had a mind set that a great restaurant would never let their customers water glass go below half and at CG it never does! Constantly refilled, napkins refolded upon our return from the bathroom, servers constantly checks up on us and bussers quickly clearing our plates. Outstanding!

My most recent visit was for Chicago Restaurant Week (CG is ALWAYS on my list for the week) and it was just the same as I had experience before. We were sat before our entire party arrived and our server patiently waited while they did. The CRW menu was similar to year&#39;s prior, but that&#39;s perfectly fine because before I sat down I knew I what I would get. 

We all shared the fried calamari with hot peppers, crunchy with a kick! Most of us had the creamy, perfectly seasoned, clam chowder. Then my favorite of all time: the bone-in kona (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-capital-grille-lombard#q4yyhTGSXpMsNRg5OWfiUQ) - I don&#39;t know how to describe this amazing piece of red meat, it&#39;s delicious, cooked to perfection, juicy, tender, packed with flavor, orgasmic, by far the best steak I&#39;ve ever had! I&#39;ve also got to try their glazed salmon (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-capital-grille-lombard#ON8dQxYzcjL2OnpyImrq4Q) and I wish I could take home CG&#39;s chefs. The salmon was moist, flavorful, and just down right delicious! Yum yum yum! My fellow first timers all raved about their dishes and couldn&#39;t wait for dessert.

I went with their homemade vanilla ice cream while majority of the group had the creme brulee, we&#39;re big on sharing so I did the smart thing of eating my ice cream with the creme brulee and I was in heaven! The combination of the 2 hit the sweet spot, yum. The creme brulee was so delicious my cousin left no evidence behind! When our server came by to ask if we needed anything else my cousin joking said, yeah another creme brulee, but we all knew he wasn&#39;t joking.

CG you always treat me like royalty and I would like to dub thee the king of outstanding service and delicious food!"

We started with he lobster crab cakes which were phenomenal. My wife orders the lobster bisque and I orders the spinach bacon salad both were very good. For dinner I ordered the bone in ribeye with porcini mushroom crust. I also had the shallot butter on the side to dip my steak in. At first the steak tasted very charred but I really enjoyed it. The shallot butter was amazing! Do try with ur steak. My wife had the ginger tuna which is a nice big portion. We also enjoyed the creamed spinach and mashed potatoes. I received a dessert plate for my birthday which had strawberry lavender ice cream. The ice cream was amazing.

I stopped in for lunch later than most and while I wanted to enjoy the ambiance, I also wanted to curl up on my sofa and watch tv. So, I called in my order and it was ready within minutes of my arrival. I was provided bread and some of nicest plastic silverware I have ever seen. Each item placed in a separate container and the condiments were all packaged up too. 

I ordered the Lobster Mac and Cheese and the Capital Burger which is a blend of sirloin, bacon and crispy onions. Everything was delicious. ......I am a fan and you should be too!

Considering we went to CG in Kansas City the night we got engaged, and our one week wedding anniversary, we decided we should do the one year at CG too. Of course, it was a great choice. This review is of a Saturday evening. 

This location, aesthetics wise, isn&#39;t as good as the Kansas City location, which has many smaller rooms off to the sides. This location only has one or two, leaving a larger central dining room that feeds off of the kitchen and gets very loud. Luckily, we were in one of the smaller rooms so it wasn&#39;t as bad, but the sound from the main area did pour in a bit. Also, it seems quite a bit smaller than the Kansas City location, but that could be a result of the layout. 

We had 5:15pm reservations, but had to switch them to 8:00pm last minute. The lady on the phone wasn&#39;t the friendliest when I called to do this, but she did it nonetheless. We showed up at 7:30pm and were seated immediately. Our server, whose name I forget off the top of my head, was a bit aloof and spacy at first, but got better as the meal went along. In the end, we really liked him quite a lot; at the beginning, we weren&#39;t quite sure. It&#39;s the guy in the photo bomb picture here on Yelp, I think ;) 

I ordered a Chopin martini with bleu cheese olives. They always make these great at CG, and this was no exception. My wife ordered some kind of martini, I forget which, with a house made pineapple vodka. Good, but I liked mine better. She liked hers better...

We ordered the oysters, for which you get four for $13. This is where the price difference with Kansas City really starts showing - in KC you get six for $15. These oysters were very small, and only okay. Based on where they came from, I expected a brinier taste, but they really weren&#39;t as briny as I had hoped based on what our waiter had told us. 

For the mains, I got the 22oz Delmonico, medium rare. My wife got the 10oz filet, medium rare. They both came out cooked perfectly, and my god...delicious. Not that I expected any less, but I had never had a bone-in beef steak at CG before, only filet&#39;s and lamb, and I was just flabbergasted by how delicious it was. My wife&#39;s filet was awesome, also. I liked mine better. She liked hers better. I see a trend ;)

For sides, we got half orders of (a) spinach, and (b) mashed potatoes. They were both good, but nothing extraordinary. The spinach, especially, was no better than what I cook at home. But it is hard to do too much special to spinach. 

As a result of our anniversary, we got champagne and delicious dessert at the end. In Kansas City, they seem to give the champagne immediately (at the beginning of your time, even before appetizers), so I prefer how Lombard does it - with dessert. 

All in all, the total for 2x martini&#39;s, 1x oyster, 1x Delmonico, 1x filet, 1/2x potatoes, and 1/2x spinach was $153. Really, a great price (but we did get dessert free, and didn&#39;t order salads...still had tons of food). I&#39;m giving it 5 stars, but I&#39;d say it&#39;s more like 4.5 rounded up."

The service was top notch because the waiter was very attentive and professional. Even though the table next to us had some questionable dinner discussion it never took away from experience. The staff even went above and beyond to decorate our table for a birthday we were celebrating and finished the evening off with a family photo and birthday dessert. This is why I&#39;m a repeat customer."

I planned a surprise birthday dinner from out of town and they were more than helpful in every aspect. It was a Monday night and they allowed us to make a reservation for 17 people. When we arrived I saw that we DID get a private room, so it must have been available. This was so appreciated and came in handy since a big group can be loud! They decorated the table with flowers for the birthday boy and gave a complimentary huge piece of cake for him as well. He said it was the best birthday he&#39;d had in a long time. 

Our server Niko or Nikko(sp?) was tremendous. He was very attentive and took pictures for us and everything. Very kind and helpful. 

The food was great as well! Although it is pricey, it was expected. They sent me a menu with prices upon request beforehand. Great place! Even better service!"

Though I am located closer to the downtown location, I like coming here more because they have parking. (A few years ago I went to the downtown location for my bday and it was extremely hard to find parking).

Last year I got the Filet Mignon, which was amazing, but this year I decided to try the Bone-in Kona for my main entree. I like this a little more than the Filet Mignon and it was cooked the way we asked for it. You also get vegetables and mash potatoes to complement the steak, which is a perfect blend. The green beans were my favorite! I also had the Clam Chowder, which was good, but I definitely had better. Lastly, I end the night with Strawberry Sorbet, which was really really good! Definitely come here for restaurant week if you haven&#39;t already!

The service was top notch as always and our waiter Jason was extremely friendly and funny. My only complaint was that a few of us ordered wine by the glass. On the menu it said the Merlot was $9, but we were charged $11. The $2 didn&#39;t bother me enough to complain, but that was definitely slick!"

Knowing that this is a chain steak house, I was expecting huge cuts of meat, that weird thing where they bring out slabs of raw beef to show off the dinner options (they don&#39;t do that here, FYI), and leaving stuffed but feeling like I&#39;d shelled out about $75 more than I should have for a nice dinner.

Luckily, I was pleasantly surprised.  Yes, there are a lot of the typical steak house features at Capital Grille, but their extra touches make this a special place to dine. First, the staff really wants to help you celebrate if you are coming for an occasion.  We were asked upon phone reservation, at the hostess desk, and by our waiter if we had anything to celebrate today.  Even though we were just celebrating a nice evening together, as we saw around the restaurant, they go out of their way to decorate the table, sign a card, and take a photo of the group who is celebrating.  This is such a great gesture as so many restaurants know their patrons have a birthday, graduation, or anniversary, but do nothing extra to make the even memorable.

Anyway, our waiter was friendly, knowledgeable, and had excellent timing.  We told him we weren&#39;t sure what to order since we didn&#39;t want huge portions of meat, so he suggested we split a salad, a steak, and a side. This obviously results in a much lower check than two adults ordering two entrees, so I was surprised that he offered to split an entree for us without an additional plate charge.  We ended up with the Cobb salad, the Kona-rubbed steak, and the lobster mac.  All of these were exceptional, well cooked, and completely satisfying.  We had just the right amount of food and enjoyed a few cocktails and a relaxing pace without the food coming out at top speed. Desserts looked tempting, but we decided to pass since we were completely full.  After the waiter came back to take our check, he asked us to wait another minute.  He came back with a complimentary cheesecake to go! Just like the attention to celebrating occasions, another nice touch to show a little extra care towards the guests. 

This is one of the few times I&#39;ve eaten out and felt like I received more than I expected in quality and customer service.  Yes, this is an expensive meal for a special splurge, but I&#39;ll be back."

I had salmon last time, and it was slimy - I prefer flaky and flavorful - not this time.

Luckily, the BBQ sauce was quite warm which heated it up somewhat to my liking. I had waffle fries, which could have been deep fried a little longer. Wife had the pulled pork, green beans, and some potato something or another. She said she liked her selections, and the sweet BBQ sauce. I mixed the sweet with the traditional BBQ sauce, and it was pretty good. 

I was disappointed that there was no ice in the soda machine. We order water, and fortunately, it was very cold out of the fountain. One of the employees put in a large bucket of crushed ice in from the top. I refilled our water cups just before we finished our meals.

I liked the &#34;free frozen custard&#34; on a small cone. It was a nice little ending to our meals.

The wait staff wasn&#39;t overly friendly. One of the servers brought something out to another patron, and walked right by us. I would have thought she would have asked, &#34;How are your meals,&#34; or some such statement to us. Didn&#39;t happen.

We may come back, but personally I like Uncle Bub&#39;s and Chuck&#39;s Southern Comfort a bit better. I wish them the best, and hope that they keep their business above water and stay around for awhile longer.

My wife got there at 11:45 and they had not even started on our order. when she got it home the side orders where hot but the meats were cold and the ribs where dry, tough as leather and uneatable. We usually go to uncle bubs but thought we would try Dickey&#39;s restaurant today. We won&#39;t be going there again!

I&#39;ve always enjoyed Dickey&#39;s in Wheaton but this location is much different. This is a new location so I was shocked with my experience. 

I noticed the filthy door as we walked in but I thought the inside might be a little cleaner. Nope! There was nobody there when we walked in. We tried to place our order and the two employees were extremely rude. We decided to not eat here and left to eat somewhere else. 

Overall- dirty restaurant inside/outside &amp; very rude employees. Next time I&#39;m craving Dickey&#39;s BBQ I will drive to Wheaton I will NOT return to this location."

Grabbed the Three Meat plate with two sides (I was hungry dammit). Tried the marinated Chicken Breast, which wasn&#39;t smoked, wasn&#39;t BBQ, however the Italian flavor profile pleased albeit a bit dry. Their pulled pork went over well enough also; however, aridity seemed to have become an all too common similarity. Top of the class for the three meat combo was the beef brisket, but by any other BBQ standards, it was mediocre and comparable to any franchise you&#39;ll find in the Chicagoland area. Being &#34;smoked to perfection&#34; would seem to indicate obvious requirements, e.g. bark, smoke ring; however, none were had. As for their house BBQ sauces (similar to their meats), not a one shined, and the concept of bland echoed. Their &#34;sweet&#34; sauce was fair, but nothing I&#39;d purchase in-store and bring home to the fam. Sides of barbeque beans were burnt and tasted of cigarette ash, seasoning was non-existent in the high school cafeteria lunch-lady land macaroni and cheese, and the slices of complimentary pickles and raw onions had no bearing (and no place, utterly stupid) on my aluminum cafeteria combo tray. If you recognize good BBQ, your patronage here will be short lived. If quick service, franchised food is your thing, this DG location needs a Chipotle next door to Dickey&#39;s and El Famous Burrito."

Food was served cold. Wife had the ribs and I had the brisket. Both had great flavor but eating BBQ cold can leave a bad taste in the mouth. Anyone who is a fan of BBQ know it&#39;s the fat renderings that can make or break the taste of the meat. 
The price for the rib plate in our opinion is high for the amount you get...5 ribs. We have eaten at other joints where you get half a slab and half a chicken plus sides for the price you&#39;ll pay here.

Our experience was terrific service, delicious food, and a very patient staff as between us and six other new customers that walked in about the same time, all with groupons,  and they helped us through it all.

Also the ultra-crushed ice is a nice change from the norm.  I agree with some of the reviewers though that thought the food was too cold - not sure why so many places seem afraid of piping hot and so they just heat to warm.

Food is 2/5
Pulled pork was ok,,,brisket not as good and the Polish sausage was just bad.
Ribs are awful, they are st.louis ribs. In chicago you have to make sure you tell us that. We eat baby backs up north. I normally don&#39;t mind st. Lou&#39;s ribs but again these are done bad. Threw half a slab in the garbage. 
All food is pulled out of a hot box! Not heated up or browned at all just hotbox to plate, very cafeteria style and just lazy if you ask me. 
Service 1/5
Bad system, one guy working his butt off and 3 other people watching him work(including manager). I waited 5-8 min just to put in a to go order, once it was in it went fast , but like I said bad system. 

With all the good BBQ in the area( Chucks, Uncle Bubs) I don&#39;t see this place lasting long."

Not consistent necessarily, but overall it was pretty good, and the complementary ice cream cones are a nice touch.  Based on my last 2 visits though, I&#39;d say this place is either poorly managed, or possibly not really managed at all.  The last visit may be my last one period.  The two employees couldn&#39;t possibly have been more lackadaisical and unmotivated.  I ordered the taco special (featured on a card at the counter - 3 tacos, 1 side and a drink for $8.50), and it took them 5 minutes and a phone call to finally let me know that I could get a 4-taco plate for $9.95.  Fine, but it would be nice to have a set menu that the employees are aware of.  Then I got my food and the soft shells were nowhere near soft.  They were crunchy and impossible to fold.  Not sure if they were stale or overcooked in the press, but as they weren&#39;t browned at all, my guess is stale.  I was thinking of complaining but by that point, the guy who made them was sitting at a table behind us with his headphones on and his head laying on the table.  Interesting.  Pretty sure I&#39;m done here, which is disappointing as it&#39;s very close to my office and there are no other good bbq places nearby."

First,, the location is awful.  It is sandwiched between Chili&#39;s and some Mexican place.  Getting to the parking area is tricky.

Second, there is an extremely small eat in area.  AND, on a cold wintry night, not one of those tables was comfortable to sit at and try to enjoy your food.  It was really cold in there.

Third ~ consistency.  Sign says ribs fall off the bone.  The one group that was actually sitting at a table said the ribs were tough and the father had complained to the manager.  We had them remove the ribs from our take out order.  2 different people tried to convince us that they would give us different ribs. &#34; No, thank you&#34;  just didn&#39;t seem to work.  Then the manager took out a couple of ribs, put BBQ sauce on them, and took them to the father.  The father said those were much better.  Why wouldn&#39;t they all be the same???

Fourth, do something about the buns. I don&#39;t know if they were old, just too big for the amount of meat, but something was just  &#34;off&#34;  with the bun.

We had the chopped brisket which was very tender and it came with 2 sides.  We ordered the Saturday special and not one person asked what we wanted to drink.. The special comes with 2 sides AND a drink. We left with no beverage.

Believe the sign that says  &#34;Order here&#34;.  Even though you cannot see a person that takes orders, stand on your tippy toes and look over the very tall counter. Voila.

Needs work, but the food is tasty, at least what we had to eat was tasty."

I have DEFINITELY had better BBQ in the burbs (cough Sharko&#39;s cough). My 1-meat plate with brisket was decent, The brisket had a nice smoke ring in it, but I have to say that 1/8 of the portion was un-edible fat. The mac and cheese side was good, no complaints there. One last thing, their free ice cream. It tastes VERY synthetic. It has a fake vanilla flavor to it, I couldnt figure it out. Wasnt terrible, just didnt taste natural. Might go back, but wont go out of my way for this place. I think this is a Texas chain now that I think about it."

There is a plethora of Chinese, Indian, Mexican, but not too many BBQ.  I spent a lot of time in Charlotte and there were tons of BBQ joints, and I definitely got spoiled.

Dickey&#39;s is a chain, but it&#39;s a good chain.  This location is new and I went on one of the first few days.  You could tell everyone is still new, but that&#39;s expected from a brand new location.  Service was still good.  The manager/owner walked around and asked me how everything was.

I have tried the beef brisket.  It is pretty tasty.  The meat was a good texture.  There are 3 types of sauce, regular, sweet, and spicy.  I mix all 3 lol.  They have daily specials which are about $7-$8 and include a meat, 2 sides, and a drink.  Good deal!

One thing I don&#39;t like about the sides is that there is bacon in the baked potato mash, or whatever it&#39;s called.  Well, I should say there is bacon and you can&#39;t have it removed.  Not a dealbreaker, but I wish I could have it without bacon.  

The ice cream is good.  I always put some in my cup for a makeshift barq&#39;s float.  The place is a little small, so it might get busy, but I haven&#39;t had any problems sitting yet.  

This place is a little far for me to go regularly, but I will definitely stop by when I&#39;m in the area."

Since loosing our favorite rib place &#34;Ribs R Us&#39; in Westmont many years ago.  I was so excited to hear that a rib place (supposedly famous for their ribs) was opening right down the street. What a huge let down. I have tried this place 3 times....and now I am done. First time was when they just opened...the rib tips were great, place was clean, service was excellent. A bit pricey, but I thought it was worth it. Second time...last week...my daughter picked up my 1/2 order of ribs and brought them to work for me. It was jerky...hard, dried out...unbelievably salty...threw them away and called. The manager Laura was really nice, apologized and said I could come in and get a replacement dinner on the house. So I did...last night. Yuck... the ribs were so salty I could feel my blood pressure rising. And not very tender either. Woke up this morning with my hands swollen and stomach cramps. Will not eat here ever again.
The Patio has great ribs...they are also pricey but so worth every bite. Guess I will have to drive a bit farther. Sorry this chain won&#39;t make it here."

I got the smoke house salad, which did have some good flavor, but a lot of the brisket was fatty, so I had to toss that to the side. Their fryer was not working, so I didn&#39;t get onion tanglers in my salad. Bummer because they are so tastefully bad for you. Also, my salad portion was half of what I usually get from the Wheaton location. There&#39;s so much that I always have leftovers for later. 

My husband got the 3 meat plate with mac n cheese and baked beans as his sides. He was dissapointed with his meal as well as the sauces. Everything was either lukewarm or cold. 

Where&#39;s my free ice cream?! The Wheaton location has an ice cream machine. Luckily my little guy wasn&#39;t with me. He would&#39;ve been so disappointed!

We had the twins with and they loved trying some of the ice cream and loved the roll as well.  Husband got the two meat plate with pulled pork and I think chicken.

There is no small talk or greeting the customer it was what can I get you and sign here pretty much. The brisket was siran wrapped in a hot tray... that&#39;s real appetizing.

I&#39;ve had ribs, spicy cheddar sausage, brisket, and pulled pork (and will be trying the chicken and BBQ ham in the near future).  All of their meat had a nice smoky flavor and none of it was fatty or tough, it&#39;s all been very good when I&#39;ve had it.  I liked it every bit as much if not more than at other BBQ places in the area like Uncle Bub&#39;s, Chuck&#39;s Southern Comforts Caf√©, and Famous Dave&#39;s.

The portions are not the largest, but I prefer quality over quantity.  

I think Dickey&#39;s sauce is really good.  It&#39;s very much Texas-style sauce - a little spicier and a bit less sweet.  Good sauce really helps make a great BBQ experience.

The sides have all been very tasty.  The fried okra and onion &#34;tanglers&#34; (what Dickey&#39;s calls their onion straws) are particularly good. I&#39;ve also had the jalapeno beans, macaroni &amp; cheese, baked potato casserole, and coleslaw and it was all consistently tasty and well-prepared.   

Unlike other reviewers, I haven&#39;t seen anything be dirty at Dickey&#39;s.  The place has seemed pretty clean to me when I&#39;ve been there.  And I haven&#39;t encountered anything but friendly staff either.  Maybe it&#39;s my spectacular beauty that never fails to charm!  ;)

For a string of excellent experiences and having more flavorful BBQ than the competitors in the area, I give Dickey&#39;s the full banana."

Oy, where too begin... oh, I know - the &#34;sorry, no groupons accepted Friday, Saturday, or Sunday&#34; sign on the door was great. I would have gladly left my order there and paid full price at Patio, but after clearly observing that my Groupon had no date restrictions the girl at the counter agreed to let us use it. (I have a whole other beef with Groupon and their downhill company...) 
Onward, they hustled and bustled and got my order together and we were on our way home for dinner. What&#39;s that...the discount double check revealed that we were missing one of our two pulled pork sandwiches. Ok, back to waiting... 
Finally out the door... Over all we ordered two of the medium sized pulled pork sandwiches, a meat plate of brisket, and 3 sides: waffle fries, mac n cheese, and the baked potato casserole. 
Brisket - pretty good, we like this a lot though for being a 1/2 lb order I wish I&#39;d had a good scale... 
Pulled Pork - eh, just okay and pretty bare bones. Pork was tender enough, but not much to say for seasoning and there was no sauce on it at all (and I like mine w/a lot of sauce personally). 
The other pulled pork - oh yeah, that&#39;s not what they whipped up in a few minutes to complete my order. Tho not exactly sure, we think it was a pulled pork and brisket sandwich. It was good, just a lil mysterious. 
Waffle fries - awesome, great seasoning 
Mac n Cheese - it&#39;s mac n cheese, not all that hard to f up
Loaded Potato Casserole - decent, kinda more whipped like the filling of a double stuffed tato. 

Over all - not too bad for taste, service and &#39;get it together-ness&#39; is lacking. Not sure we&#39;ll be back too soon considering Patio and Chuck&#39;s are down the road."

I ordered the three meat plate that came with two sides and a drink. I got their hot sausage link, beef brisket and pulled pork with cold slaw and the jalapeno beans. Texans don&#39;t put sauce on their Q--they want to taste the smokiness of the meat and serve their sauce on the side--I don&#39;t care for it that way, in fact most Mid westerners don&#39;t. Now about their sauce-they offered three: original, spicy and sweet. I got a sample of each and I couldn&#39;t tell the difference. They all tasted like watered down tomato paste with chili seasoning added. They offer free soft serve ice cream so I didn&#39;t order dessert. The soft serve tasted like they dumped skim milk and vanilla flavoring into a soft serve machine. I wish I had something positive to say about this place but I don&#39;t. The storefront was dirty, the girls behind the counter didn&#39;t wear anything to imply that they worked there--not even a name tag and everything looked like it was precooked somewhere else and simply heated up when you ordered it.

So many places these days will apologize for an issue, but they won&#39;t do anything beyond merely finishing the job.

I was quite happy with the order.  I had 2 meats, while the rest of the family had ribs.  We also enjoyed the fries, onion strings, baked beans, cole slaw, and baked potato casserole.  Everything was hot.  Definitely, Dickey&#39;s is in our rotation."

It&#39;s close to home and I&#39;m a fool for good barbecue.  Was very disappointed.  Once you step into the place, it very clean and well kept.  However, behind the counter, the staff looks to be very unsure of themselves.  I stood at the counter watching one staff member wrapping some meat meticulously.  Then I watched her clean her station.  All before acknowledging the customer(me) or the 4 people waiting behind me.  She was nice enough and it wasn&#39;t just her.  It was painfully obvious that the front line staff were woefully under-trained.  

As for the food, The brisket was chopped and cold.  I couldn&#39;t make out a smoke ring in the meet.  The spicy was alright, but nothing extraordinary. The mac and cheese tasted like it had been taken straight out the can.  The waffle fries were under cooked and salty.  

The free ice cream was a nice touch.  However, the machine was placed near the entrance which just seemed out of place.  

This is the first week that they are open and I expect that I will give them another chance down the line.  However, the reviews I&#39;ve read from their Wheaton location do not give me much hope."

The only way to describe Dickey&#39;s is that it&#39;s like the Subway of BBQ.  I ordered the two meat plate (ham and beef brisket) with baked beans and potato salad, and a smokehouse salad for my wife.  The staff seemed very tentative, like they didn&#39;t know what they were doing.  I knew I was in for a big disappointment when the guy behind the counter reached into the smoker and pulled out the meat wrapped in saran wrap.  It went down hill from there.

When I got home to eat, the meat was already cold, and basically had no taste at all.  I felt like I was eating something from one of those low end buffet places.  The brisket was just plain bad - probably the worst BBQ I&#39;ve had.  The baked beans and potato salad were also sub par.  Just as a comparison, the baked beans were on par with the canned kind you get at the grocery store.  

Save your time, and your money, and skip this place.  If you like BBQ, check out Chuck&#39;s Southern Comforts Cafe.  It&#39;s WAY better..."

Overall not bad, but not good either i ordered a rib plate,  and a two meat plate with brisket and turkey with potato salad and coleslaw.  Every thing was very bland and not alot of flavor( all meat and sides included in that). The one bbq sauce i did get was ok though, i guess theres 3 but i wasnt offered a choice.  Rolls tasted a bit old. Staff was not very friendly,  plus made it obvious they didn&#39;t want to be there.  I&#39;m also curious about the claim to smoke in house- none of the meat had the signiture pink rim that smoked foods have, so I don&#39;t know if maybe it only smoked for 20 minutes?   The ribs also came out of a bag......"

I had won a free meal prize from a blog I follow. I have to admit I had never even heard of them before and didn&#39;t even know there was this location in DG before the giveaway. It&#39;s not the best location but they make it work. Now we received the XL family pack, 3 meats (1lb each) , 4 sides and 8 rolls plus pickles, onions and the sauce on the side. Let me tell you it can feed the family of 4 - 6 quite nicely. We only have the 2 of us so we stretched it to 2 meals easily. Rolls were very basic but not to hard and great for mopping up sauce, pickles were sweet and tasty. Sauce was sweet but not to much, not to salty, had a little bit of a kick. I liked it. We tried the onion tangles which were a generous portion seasoned nicely not to salty, and not to skinny either, they were great when mixed in with the meat. The waffle fries that were dusted with a great seasoning and perfectly cooked not to soft and not overly crunchy. Mac n cheese was very basic just noodles and cheese. Good but could be better.  Plus the baked potato casserole which is just mashed potatoes with bacon cheese and green onions on top. Really tasty comfort food here. Moving onto the meat we got the pulled pork and beef. They were both tender, moist, smokey with a slight after kick which we both loved. Even great the next day even before we warmed it back up. Plus the ribs. They were fall of the bone and delicious. Moist and decent amount of meat. Atmosphere in the restaurant is quaint and has character. Staff is very nice and helpful. Not a huge eating area, but would recommend for lunch or just ordering for carry-out. Simple but great choice menu. Was not paid for my review all thoughts and feelings are my own and just like going out of my way to recognize a great place like this one. Will be returning soon."

Pulled pork had no flavor or smoke taste 2nd problem. Sausage was good but cold and no smoke flavor 3 strikes  . Sides (mac N Cheese , potato casserole ) were not bad if they would have heated them.

There is free soft serve ice cream that was really bad, tasted like it doesn&#39;t have any dairy in it and like its thawed and been refrozen several times.

I&#39;m so mad I spend $40 (I had a groupon) on something that barely fed 3 people when it said family pack feeds up to 5-6 people.

Pro&#39;s:
The service was great, friendly and helpful.
The meat selection was very plentiful and we had both brisket and cheese sausage. 
Both selections we had were very enjoyable. The side selection is also a bit larger than other of the same genre, and all that we chose tasted great. 
The free ice cream was a nice touch to clean the pallet. 
Con&#39;s:
The main issue, in my opinion is the size of the portions for the price. We felt they were smaller than most other BBQ options. Also, all our plates had included the heel or very tough parts of the cut of meat. I guess that there are others that might enjoy these parts of the result, but they were larger than I expected, and were not enjoyable. The sides where also smaller."

Despite the food being positively superb, the service was the worst I&#39;ve ever experienced anywhere.  The word &#34;pit&#34; in their name is certainly well-deserved.  I placed an online order.  I chose the time &#34;right now,&#34; and it instructed me to leave right away.  When I got there (I even took my time getting there), I went to the &#34;online order&#34; pickup counter and was told (by another customer) that there was a line (for online order pickups).  Three people were in front of me.  None of the orders were ready.  Other people who were coming in placing orders, were getting their food before us.  25 damn minutes later, it was &#34;my turn&#34; and the owner informed me that they were out of ribs (one of the three dinners I ordered), that there would be a half-hour (more) wait (unless I changed the order).  I changed the ribs to pulled-pork, which he said was &#34;ready.&#34;  That took an additional 15 minutes to pack.  It seemed like nobody back there knows how to run a restaurant proper.  They were having all sorts of issues.  I thought maybe they were having a bad night, but the cashier said that it&#39;s been like that ever since they opened (three weeks ago).  What a shame.  The food here was so good that this could easily have become my favorite BBQ place (or at least nearest favorite).  It&#39;s right down the street from where I live, and I hate the long drive all the way to Baby Back Blues in Plainfield every time I get a hankering for BBQ (though I&#39;m always delighted afterwards).  Damn.  They either ought to learn how to run the place or sell it to someone who can.  They deserve one star (because that&#39;s the lowest I can go), but I&#39;ll give &#39;em 2... just on HOPE that they can get their act together.  I really want them to succeed."

That could not be more accurate. It really is the Subway of BBQ. You start at one end of the counter to place your order and pay at the far end. The night I went they were out of almost everything. I ended up getting the brisket and the spicy cheddar sausage. The brisket was fatty and the sausage was fair. I did like the sauces though. The staff seemed lost and could not coordinate with each other. The prices are not Subway style, they were higher in fact, and the sides were average. I guess I would go back, if I was in the mood for Subway style BBQ."

Looked pretty good when I passed by so figured I try the place since good Mexican food is hard to come by in the burbs! To say the least, I was very elated that the tacos were actually good! More than good! AND, they offered carnitas tacos which not many places do. I also got an al pastor taco which also far exceeded my expectations. Both were very good...not greasy nor fatty meats which is hard to come by at most taco joints. They also weren&#39;t skimpy on the meat. Rice and beans were good. Rice had a nice flavor, wasn&#39;t bland like most places too. 

Place is intimate, but has a nice sit down area. It&#39;s kind of out of the way for me, but it would definitely be worth a trip if I wanted some good tacos in the burbs. It&#39;s kind of a hidden gem at the corner, you can miss it if you weren&#39;t walking by."

First of all, it&#39;s a very small place and as soon as you walk in, there&#39;s a smell of fried food combined with a musty odor so we were not very pleased upon going in. Not to mention, there&#39;s a sign by the door for everyone to leave their strollers outside (what if it&#39;s raining??!) The person behind the counter didn&#39;t seem very happy to be there either - very serious. We ordered 3 tacos of chicken, 3 of steak, and 3 of chorizo, as well as a jarrito and horchata. The total came out to almost $30. The chicken tacos were okay but we liked that they were soft and shredded for my son to eat. The steak was a bit chewy but this happens often with tacos. The chorizo was the best one in my opinion. The horchata was good too - not too sweet. Overall, tacos were good but some of the negatives kind of outweigh the positives so we probably won&#39;t go out of our way to go here again."

It&#39;s located at a corner off of Main street.  There&#39;s street parking and they are next to a parking lot as well.
When you walk in, it&#39;s a cozy little space.  A few tables of four and a couple of 2 seater tables on the side of the wall.  They have a flat screen TV and plants along their huge front window display.  You just come in place your order and have a seat.
They give your free warm chips and 2 types of salsa, the red is REALLY hot for my taste.  
They serve Mexican or American style dishes.  Mexican is: onions and cilantro.  American is: lettuce, tomato, and cheese.
They have meat options such as: Steak, Ground Beef, Shredded Chicken, Al Pastor, Carnitas, Chorizo, Fish.
They also offer Vegetarian Options: Avocado, Chile Relleno, Cheese, Cheese &amp; Onion, Fajita Veggies
They even serve breakfast all day!  
If you look at their menu, they also make your typical Hot dogs Burgers, and Gyros to accommodate everyone&#39;s palate!
And don&#39;t forget desserts too if you plan to stay longer, lol!
It was nice that the owner took the time to chit chat with us on how our meals were.  He said that they will even try to accommodate of your order.

Now on to the food:
-Chimichanga; my friend enjoyed it, she got steak and the fixins.  It&#39;s a pretty nice size, that she ended up taking some home.  Deep-fried crispy and golden brown, with Mexican rice and beans.  She said the sides were ok.  

-I tried their Al Pastor corned taco, Mexican style.  It was flavorful and well-seasoned.

-I ordered what I came here for...their Carne Asada Fries!  Even a guy who was picking up his order, said yeah you&#39;ll really like they dish, it&#39;s good!
It&#39;s a pretty big portion that you can share as an appetizer or have it as a meal.  The fresh cut fries were still hot and crispy with grilled tender steak, onions, and cilantro. Topped with salsa verde, fresh guacamole, cheese, grilled red bell peppers, sour cream, and lime wedges.  So refreshing with all the different layers, apparently this is a popular dish in California and this is my first time trying it.  Both my foodie friend and my friend who I went here (are Cali gals) stated it taste and looked good.  I&#39;d get this again.
I enjoyed the conversations with the owners, very nice people the &#34;Muse&#34; we called the lady in front of the house with that cute maroon hair and the chef behind the counter.  He gets his inspiration all over the place and brought the Carne Asada Fries idea straight from California!

-To end the night here, we ate a dessert of a nice platter of fried chips covered in cinnamon sugar and served with chocolate syrup and topped with whipped cream.  Delish! 

Overall, a very nice experience.  I&#39;d come back here again and try their other dishes."

I ordered the steak gordita and chicken flauta which were both a little greasy but surprisingly decent. The steak gordita came in a handmade tortilla that was stuff with steak with the option of cilantro and onions or lettuce and tomato. It had a good amount of steak and I think 3 would fill someone up. The chicken flauta is a deep fried rolled taco. The chicken was cubed not shredded.

I was overwhelm with everything that had to offer that I couldn&#39;t filter out what they are known for. So i decided on a steak burrito and it was pretty heavy to carry so I figure lunch and dinner for me. Their pricing was great and affordable. The burrito was heavy with guac and steak and the tortilla was so nice and soft.

The food is OK, not special. The fish in the fish tacos looks and tastes like fish sticks. The steak nachos are yummy, though. Last year we would get a complimentary basket of chips with our meals. Nice touch and the chips are warm and fresh. This year we haven&#39;t gotten any complimentary chips. My husband noticed that the &#34;regulars&#34; and patrons who speak Spanish tend to get a free basket of chips. It kind of sticks in my craw. Each time we dine in we order full dinners and beverages. Why don&#39;t we deserve free chips?? And the other reviewers are right about the cashier. She is not friendly or welcoming.

Upon entering I was greeted kindly and the energy the front of the house cashier had was addicting. I couldn&#39;t help but feel excited about my first visit. I ordered a traditional Mexican sandwich I have grown up on called the &#34;Torta&#34;. 

Although I came in for the sandwich I was totally up sold on making it a dinner with rice and beans. I sat down with my giant size Horchata and out came a tasty basket of salted warm chips and two different salsas. Food arrived to my table quickly with the same energy. Definitely a positive experience and the surrounding customers had to be regulars since the vibe I got they new one another.

The Torta bread was toasted and filled with lettuce, tomato, onions, mayo and avocados. I enjoyed it very much. I grabbed a carryout menu on the way out and was glancing it over as I walked to my car. They do have a quite a bit of authentic dinner options. Looks like a return visit is a must.

I notice they serve Gyros, Hot Dogs, Burgers and Brats for those with more of a &#34;gringo&#34; taste palette :) 

Great job Alfredo&#39;s, til next time."

So happy to have a place with 1) these particular items, and 2) so good. We also got fried cauliflower, which was a total surprise....super good!

Alfredo&#39;s is a mixed bag for me. The food is generally good, the service can be good, but sometimes comes with some attitude.. I&#39;ve had the tacos and enchiladas here. My meat preference here is pretty much anything besides carnitas. The carnitas seems like a thin pork chop just cut into slices, which i&#39;ve never seen at another Mexican restaurant luckily. I do like the chicken... it tastes good. However, it also kind of scares me because I can&#39;t tell if it&#39;s cooked all the way sometimes. I&#39;ve never had an issue though and have eaten it several times.. If you dine in, they give you chips also, no salsa... just the hot sauce bottles. The hot sauce is decent. I prefer the green over the red at this place. They do have Mexican Coke, which is a bonus to me. Prices are normal for this type of food in the area. The location is good, right in downtown Downers Grove. There is a lot next door, and you could also use street parking. One note for those sensitive to tobacco smoke - there is a Cigar shop/lounge next door.

I love carnitas and they were kind enough to allow me to substitute it for the carne asada. Unfortunately this carnitas was not cooked properly.

They also have tamales in green and red.  The interesting thing is they have a lot of other non mexican food.  Like jalapeno poppers, corn dogs, italian ice, gyros...
They gave a small plate of chips and both the green and red salsas are tasty.

Even though it&#39;s called &#34;Taqueria,&#34; it&#39;s not just Mexican food. This is a &#34;city food&#34; kinda place, which are my favorites! They have gyros, Mexican food, burgers, hot dogs, Phillies, etc. I&#39;d say 1/2 their menu is Mexican, and the other is everything else. It was Cinco de Mayo, so we had to do something Mexican.

CARNE ASADA FRIES
Imagine getting Carne Asada Nachos at a real Mexican taqueria (not Taco Bell), and then replace the chips with french fries. Voila, you have Carne Asada Fries. SO, discarding the fact that french fries and Mexican flavors don&#39;t mix (at least not for me), part of the genius behind tortilla chips is that you can scoop all that Nacho-y goodness because of the shape. A french fry is a stick! You&#39;re not gonna scoop anything with a stick! So you have to pretty much eat it with a fork. I really didn&#39;t really get a lot of flavor with the asada and the combination was forgettable.

TACOS
The steak wasn&#39;t all that great or flavorful (like the Asada Fries), so they didn&#39;t lend too much here either. They were acceptable tacos, just nothing to write home about. Al Pastor was definitely better than Asada, but they were still pretty weak. Not enough flavor, not enough seasoning. Again, perfectly acceptable taco, but nothing special. Al Pastor - go to Los Fernandez in Schaumburg. Al Pastor -- go to King Taco in LA.

CHILE RELLENO
I was worried it was going to be a tiny thin poblano, but no, it&#39;s a good size and wide pepper. I know they&#39;re not supposed to be spicy, but this one never even dreamed of spice! The cheese inside, though, was very welcomed, and, although not spicy, it did have a slight enough poblano flavor to mix with that chihuahua cheese. They serve tortillas with it, but I don&#39;t use them.

CHORIZO QUESADILLA
My friend discovered this at America&#39;s Bar (yes...a bar) and it was so amazing. I could go into a whole dissertation about chorizo but I&#39;ll spare you the excitement. For these quesadillas to work, though, you have to have the right amount of crisp, and the right amount of greasy. Alfredo&#39;s did not. The chorizo was not flavorful, but more like, down and out. Definitely wasn&#39;t greasy, but thankfully, it wasn&#39;t dry either. Very forgettable and not worth money, even though it is pretty cheap. 

TAMALE
Served in a corn husk, but it was much drier than I&#39;ve had before. It wasn&#39;t as dry as you can get without being crispy or crunchy. My tongue and tonsils were shriveling up! I needed to douse it with...

HORCHATA
Anything sugary is going to be good, and here is no different, but as far as Horchatas go, they were lacking. It tasted like sweetened milk, which is about 75% of the way there, but you gotta have that cinnamon flavor to it. That&#39;s what it was missing, and so it fails as an horchata...but it&#39;s still sweet so I liked it! 

BLAH-QUERIA
Even though pointswise, it is definitely a 2 star place (2.3), I feel bad about it. Nothing really tasted bad (except maybe the Tamale), but 2 almost seems like they&#39;re serving sewage, but really, it&#39;s not that bad. You could do a lot worse...but you could also do a lot....LOT better.

...And I REALLY don&#39;t get the hype about the carne asada fries."

I am from California and I went to college in San Diego.  San Diego is known for it&#39;s good Mexican food and it&#39;s unique dish known as Carne Asada Fries.  If you don&#39;t know, San Diego is about 1 hr away from the Mexican/US border.  Anyway, in the San Diego county, you ALWAYS find a Rigoberto&#39;s, Roberto&#39;s, Lolita&#39;s, MXN, etc on every street.  It was heaven for you french fries lovers, college starving students, or after a good drunken night.  What IS carne asada fries?

Carne Asada Fries: french fries mixed with beef underneath a layer of cheese, salsa, guacamole, and sour cream.

REVIEW:
I heard about Alfredo&#39;s through a friend.  He went to my college in San Diego and we&#39;re both here for more schooling.  He apparently introduced the restaurant about carne asada fries and now they serve it!

Yesterday, I took two friends with me on this hunt for Carne Asada Fries.
The french fries were cooked just fine.  I felt there needed to be more of the cheese, salsa, and guac.  There was no sour cream.  There was red bell peppers, which is different.  Portion-size, it was on the smaller end than what I&#39;m used to, but honestly it is just fine.  It is on the pricier end about $9-10 for an order.  However, I felt because IL doesn&#39;t even have carne asada fries, it&#39;s expected.

Well, later on I met up with another friend and she was hungry.  Honestly I was still hungry too.  SOOO I took her here 2 hours after my FIRST order.

This time, I found out that he DOES have sour cream.  Alfredo, honey, you throw that in there :)  We also enjoyed a delicious slice of their authentic homemade flan.  YUM

So there you have it.  I gave it 4 stars because I&#39;ve obviously had better, but the rarity of this dish is worth the price and portion size.

THANK YOU for serving carne asada fries.  It was delicious and I will be back for more."

I don&#39;t understand the hype about this place.  I did not have a good experience at all.  The place was pretty dirty and smelled kinda like a dirty sock.  My and my buddy were going to eat there, but after catching a whiff we decided it would be better to get it to go.  I got the Chimichanga and a Horchata with a side of sour cream, and my buddy got the enchiladas with chips and salsa.  When we presented the coupon and they tried to only take half off for some reason ($5 instead of $10).  Whether there were other issues with the bill we will never know since this is one of those places that just tell you the total and never give you a receipt..  The food came out after a little while and we hit the road.

When we got home we realized that they forgot the sour cream.  As a big sour cream fan, that sucked.  I had to sit there a minute and weigh the options...eat the meal without the sour cream, or go back and get it and eat a cold meal.  I opted for the first.  Another thing about this place is when you ask from plenty of hot and mild, they give you one tiny container of each for 2 people.  Not cool.  Not cool at all.  

Anyway...on to the food.  My chiimi was pretty good, but nothing special.  There was nothing on it like some places do...i.e sauce, cheese, sour cream, gauc.  This wouldn&#39;t normally make a difference to me if but since they skimped on the hot sauce and forgot the sour cream it made it a little dry.  The horchata was pretty good.  The chips and salsa were pretty dang good, but you could definitely use more chips.  My buddy said his enchilada was ok, but it too lacked sauce.

Overall the food was just ok, but the overall experience was pretty bad and I will not be back."

The tacos al pastor are very good. The best I&#39;ve had in the Chicago area to date.  I love that they put pineapple in their al pastor!  

Tried the asada fries and wasn&#39;t a big fan.  There&#39;s a reason why the use tortilla chips! Overall, the tacos were great!  Also tried the gordita de pollo (chicken) which was good, but not as good as the al pastor.  I&#39;ll definitely be back!"

All you Cali kids in the area (and yes, I know that there are a lot of you) give it a try! It&#39;s not bad:
The cut of the fries are in between shoe string and steak fries w/ skin.
The carne asada is flavorful (but may almost be too salty for my taste...cut it with some lime)
Topped with a LOT of guacamole and some cheese.
Portion is considerable.

I do wish that they would include some sour cream though...crucial!

They charge around $9 bucks and some change which may be more than I am use to BUT, its a great thing to satisfy a craving.

TRY IT. Let&#39;s make it part of the menu!"

I knew we should have walked out right when walked in because of the smell! Taking a look at their interesting menu American/Mexican my sister and I opted for the Veggie Burrito and the Veggie Tacos; both asking for avocado to be added and one tea. Our total came out to over $21-pricy for just 2 veggie tacos and a veggie burrito! We ate inside (unfortunately) but were served very delicious salsa verde and warm chips. My sisters burrito came with under cooked peppers, a sliver of avocado, sour cream, cheese and lettuce-NO beans or rice inside. My veggie tacos came with the same flavorless under cooked peppers, sour cream (extra $0.89) lettuce, almost no avocado, and cilantro, I asked for cheese to be added but there was none on my tacos.

I must admit upon walking in I thought I was visiting a place called Boagies, I discovered that this place was Boagies and now is Alfredo&#39;s Taqueria. In taking a look around I noticed a few comfortable tables and chairs. It&#39;s small but comfortable inside.

I came in and decided to try the hot dog and fries they offer. At only 2.99 this wasn&#39;t a bad deal. My food was ready shortly and the very polite gentleman made small talk with me while I waited for the food to be prepared. First off, let me go over the hot dog.

The hot dog was on a poppy seed style bun, the bun was soft and had just the right texture. The hot dog itself appeared to be a standard skinless dog but was well heated and tasted fine. The pickles included were strange and had a slightly different flavor than your usual Chicago style pickle spear. I&#39;d describe this as somewhere between cucumber slices and a regular pickle. The hot peppers weren&#39;t too hot and were a nice compliment. The relish was well applied as was the mustard. I didn&#39;t detect any celery salt on this hot dog, and there were nice thinly sliced pieces of tomato on the hot dog itself. Overall this is a pretty good representation of what a Chicago style hot dog should be, and outside of the strange pickle and lack of celery salt this would have been a four star dog.

The fries included weren&#39;t quite as good as the dog. These were fairly typical fresh cut fries, these didn&#39;t seem to be particularly salty or overcooked, but they just didn&#39;t have a lot of flavor. For those who have read my many other reviews of hot dog stands, I generally am not a fan of fresh cut fries, and these were no exception.

Overall I liked my food at Alfredo&#39;s Taqueria and would definitely visit again. The friendly staff and cozy environment were nice. While I wouldn&#39;t necessarily get the dog and fries again, I&#39;d definitely be willing to try a burrito, taco or something else as that seems to be more of their specialty."

We got the burrito special, which was a standard burrito with rice &amp; beans, with a soda. We also got guacamole and chips. Both were amazing! We each had enough for lunch the next day. 

When my husband and I ordered take out, he got the enchiladas, which he loved, and I got the burrito again! We also got the chips and salsa (with guacamole). My only &#34;complaint&#34; was that I wanted more chips with my guac, but I&#39;ll ask next time.

Due to work I had to temporarily live around Downers Grove area. I had gotten tired of other &#34;Mexican&#34; restaurants and their crappy Americanized food until I saw a sign on Main Street in downtown Downers Grove selling tamales, pozole, and esquites. I decided to give it a try, and it is one risk I was glad to take. 

First of all, Alfredo&#39;s menu accurately marks the Americanized Mexican food and separates it from the real Mexican food. Don&#39;t get me wrong; I&#39;m sure their Americanized Mexican food is great and would please the palate of anyone who craves it or likes it. However, as a Mexican I grow tired of eating Americanized Mexican food such as burritos or tacos filled up with non traditional Mexican ingredients (such as yellow cheddar cheese or sour cream), finding a place where they serve the real deal was like finding a treasure.  Alfredo&#39;s offers the best chile rellenos and pozole I&#39;ve had in the area. They also offer the soft tacos with cilantro and cebolla (as I said before, they also have the American version with lettuce, tomato, and sour cream), sopes, and tortas. Their tortillas are fresh and made out of corn!

Another positive aspect is their service. Alfredo, the owner, and his parents are the servers and cooks there. So they are very careful and helpful and make you feel you are at home. They speak Spanish and English fluently, and keep you good company if you go there by yourself and want to chat a little.  Alfredo&#39;s mom cooks a great soup that tastes &#34;home made&#34;; and I guess it&#39;s literally that flavor since it is the one she cooked when they were living in Mexico. 

The restaurant decorations and atmosphere are also  great. What I like about them is that although Alfredo brought some decorations from Mexico that make the place look a little stereotypical of what and American expects of a Mexican restaurant, they are unique (not the typical pi√±ata hanging there). They also left much of the older restaurant bringing out the American culture.

It is very clean and pretty. The bathrooms are always clean and attended (toilet paper, paper towels). The view from inside is calming. There is a huge flat screen on the corner but it is not too loud. I&#39;m not sure if there is background music, but one day I needed to study there and they turned everything off so I could finish my work (I was grateful for that - there were no other clients at that moment).

Since I found it I&#39;ve been there 5 times. I will miss it when I go back to my home town."

It&#39;s cheap, fast, delicious, and most of all authentic.  

I felt obligated to write a review about this place as this was my 3rd trip to Alfredo&#39;s this week.  The place is tiny so most people order take out.  The menu is large...it&#39;s hard to make a decision at times.  However, I tend to keep it simple and almost always order the steak tacos - you can&#39;t go wrong.  You can get your tacos American Style (lettuce tomato &amp; cheese) or Mexican Style (cilantro &amp; onions).  My go-to is the steak tacos, mexican style, and I add avocado.  Ask for limes and salsa verde and drench your tacos with them both.  The flavor is amazing."

Only one visit but sure liked what I saw got.  Place inside a bit cramped and pretty warm in summer but friendly low key staff.  Great pricing and food rnages from good to great.

Tortilla chips quite good, warm and two tasty salsas

Had fried cauliflower - bit heavier o nthe batter than I expected - would have liked less but they were very tasty in any case.  Health can wait.

Tried Carne Asada fries - miss the hot sauce I got in San Diego and as folks mentioned they are better for sharing - three healthy appetite folks could make it a nice starter.  Would like the fries to be a bit crispier to better hold up - but you can put on your own hot sauce - and they were good.

Al Pastor Tacos totally rock - five stars all the way prefer Mexican (corn tortilla, cilantro and onion) vs American (flour, lettuce, cheese) - though that might work better for steak.

Btw not a reason for going but their rice was remarkably good for a inexpensive taco place.  Beans fine nothing special.  

Monday night taco deal a steal and a ton of food.

1. Carne asada fries are mind blowing and delicious. I absolutely have never had any dish like that that combined the wonderfully addictive French fry with everything that&#39;s right about nachos. 

2.  The Mexican steak (steak a la Mexicana) is THE BEST I have had anywhere. The steak is perfect. Tender and flavorful. No fatty pieces. 

3.  Service. The people there are cordial and friendly. Conversational and eager to please. They want you to have a good time and will help you decide what to get if you&#39;re overwhelmed with tasty options.

Downers Grove does not have much of a dining scene...numerous Italian restaurants and pizza places which gets old real quick, and 3 bars, one of them unable to properly cook a burger (Ballydoyle, I&#39;m looking at you!).

Alfredo&#39;s is a family run Mexican restaurant that serves up some seriously great food.  I personally love their shredded chicken (in either tacos, quesadillas, burritos, and tortas).  GREAT tamales...which IMHO is a lost art around here.   Excellent home made soup, great horchata and plenty of bottled Mexican Coke.  

Staff is super friendly and service is prompt.  Place is clean and prices are very reasonable.

I hope the village of DG helps this place out.....they are in dire need of some new restaurants beyond Italian and bar food.   I&#39;ve been spreading the work to help support this place.

The owner was a really nice guy that seemed to appreciate my meat choosing of al pastor for the burrito as he was telling me that when he first opened the restaurant that no one would seemed to order al pastor so he started giving little samples of it for any customers that would try it and more patrons started ordering it.

They don&#39;t skimp on their portions as my tacos were quite sizable and tasty for $2.19 each on corn tortillas.  I recommend getting them ala Mexican style, with onions and cilantro, as that&#39;s the true way of getting tacos.

This location has had places come and go but I hope this place stays. 

They sometimes have really great specials, like their tacos on Mondays. Their tamales are wonderful and their flautas are made very well. 

When Getting the tacos I prefer the Mexican style with cilantro and onion, most places now a days you have to specifically ask for that, and they ask you right when you order. 

If you like real Mexican food please go to this local place and support them."

I am still searching for a place that can hook up my taco fix on the cheap and still be seasoned well and not all dried up. The al pastor was the highlight although not completely authentic. The carne asada and the chorizo were just over cooked and dry. Beans and rice were standard and nothing to write home about.

Staff was super friendly as always and the horchata was good but I can&#39;t remember a taco dinner only coming with 2 tacos? Am I weird to think that they should always come with 3 tacos? Anyways this place is worth another shot but it didn&#39;t completely satisfy my taco craving for now. Good thing there are tons of places to check out in the area"

If the chef were working the register, too, this place would be packed... a very congenial guy. The woman working the front (his wife?) should try to chill a bit.

The food and quality are top notch. The restaurant itself is spotless. The Pho broth is clean and very flavorful. The vermicelli bowls are presented nicely and very good. Spring rolls are fresh. Service is always great. If there is one thing that I would say to the owner it would be to put some personal touches on the walls and add some authentic decor to make it feel like a Vietnamese restaurant. Doing that would make this stand alone. Anyway it is a must try for great Vietnamese food!!

We tried to order the banh mi- they&#39;re out of bread. 
Out of Pepsi.
I heard several people asking for sauces that a typical Asian place would have. Nope.

I ordered hot tea and it took far too long to come out. And was served by a young girl with wet hair and flip flops... I&#39;m all for the family pitching in, but not when they&#39;re ready for bed.

The husband and I both ordered pho (as we were denied banh mi). We then had to wait for silverware. 

The worst part was our pho was served without the sprouts and cilantro. Every other table had platters of these add-ins, but we got the shaft.

I don&#39;t know that we&#39;ll be back. And, that&#39;s a shame cause we love Vietnamese food."

     My wife and I went for dinner on a Saturday evening. Weekend impromptu dinners out are usually a little tough for us since we&#39;re not big on crowds or patience when it comes to waiting for food. Wait nor crowds were an issue here. There was only one set of diners when we walked in. The place was very quiet. Actually a bit too quiet in my opinion. I may recommend some soft &#34;cover&#34; music. 
    Anyway, we started with an order of spring rolls. They were very light and cool. Perfect for a 90 degree day like Saturday was. They are, for those unaware, rice paper wrapped, not fried, and served cold. These were filled with shrimp, pork,  and cucumber, along with some greens. All fresh and delicious. 
    Moving on to entrees, I ordered the pho with BBQ pork and shrimp, topped with a few small halved egg rolls, vermicelli, daikon, cilantro, mint, and probably a couple of other things. I want to say a few things about this pho, and pho in general. The mint is not like Wrigley gum or mouthwash. It&#39;s a hint... a light accompaniment. Unless you hate mint, you probably won&#39;t even notice it. Also, this dish is served in a very large bowl, with all ingredients separate. The cold items are cold, the warm meats are... well.. warm. This way you mix it yourself and things don&#39;t start wilting before it hits your table. It was all very fresh and tasted wonderful. I was even given some special hot chili oil to round it all off. The pho is worth it alone. Really. Now, my wife ordered from the small chinese menu they maintain for those who aren&#39;t so sure about the vietnamese food. She was afraid of the mint, which is why I mentioned it specifically. The chicken with noodles was great. No complaints. But after tasting my pho, she agreed that next time she&#39;ll be joining that club. 
    All in all, very good experience with no real complaints at all. The prices are in line (or maybe a touch high for the food/area), the food is fresh, the service was pretty good. The dining area was clean. That said, if you want ambiance, this may not be the place for you. It&#39;s a little bland in that area. But I go for the food. Boring but clean is fine with me when the food is on point like you&#39;ll find here."

This rating is due to the following...1. The service was extremely slow. We waited for the food over 45 minutes after ordering. This did not counted the 15 minutes wait for them to take our order. 2. There was six dish ordered, five minutes after taking the order, they came out and told us they can only serve 5 because they were out of bread. Three bowl of Pho came out, one of them is meatball pho came without meat balls. The other two dish came out after half of the table was done eating. 3.  The flavor...pho is rated about a 2...below par.  This due to high stench of raw meat n lack of pho flavor.  The banh mi sandwich is nothing to rave about. It was shy of meat at both ends. The vermicelli bowl was shy of noodles n the meat was too salty. 

So in good conscience, I would not refer this establishment for real Asian foodies. You will be sorely disappointed!  We stopped by because of the rating and are from out of town.  Hopes this helps."

We had everything from the Banh Mi  sandwich (bbq pork)) to the #17 Rice Vermicelli bowl and everything was terrific. I am wanting to back and try the Pho which looked delicious ( the table next to us ordered a few bowls), The parking lot is a little awkward but manageable. They have a nice selection on the menu and the inside is welcoming, but the big attraction is the freshness and quality.

I stopped in today for two orders of pho and some spring rolls. The pho was great, and the spring rolls were a real treat, but everything felt a few dollars more expensive than it should have been (particularly for the area). Pho was about $10 each, spring rolls were $6, which set me back close to $30 for lunch. Considering how incredibly simple pho is, $10 feels like a lot. The meat also had a strange texture to it.

Their parking lot is really crazy, as you&#39;ve got to take a supremely hard right to get in if you&#39;re coming from the north, and you can&#39;t turn in left when you&#39;re coming from the south (or turn left when you&#39;re leaving) because of the massive median strip there. It&#39;s not that big of a deal, just something to be aware of so you don&#39;t curb it coming in.

Oh, and I&#39;m not sure if whether it&#39;s because this place is new, but it is absurdly clean inside. I&#39;ve been to a lot of asian restaurants, both dine-in and take out, in my life, and Vietnam Gate is in its own universe of cleanliness."

Since Chinatown was right across the street from the hotel where I was staying, I ventured out and brought back some of the best and most complex pho I&#39;d ever had.  It was heaven and a high water mark for me.

On a chilly gray Friday in North Aurora, that craving returned and I just had to head over to Vietnam Gate for a pho fix.

I drove over early to avoid the rush hour traffic and the place was empty, but when I opened the door the most wonderful aromas enveloped me.  The very helpful and friendly lady behind the counter took my order and went to prepare it.  Besides both chicken and beef pho, I ordered two gui cuon, a large order of chicken lo mein and marinated pork and shrimp with vermicelli.

My order was made very quickly, packaged nicely, and I was even helped with the packages to my car!  Now that&#39;s service!

If there is a single word that describes all of the tasty food we had, it would be Fresh, with a capital F.  The pho broth was very nice with just the right touches of ginger, cloves and star anise, not overly salty, the thinly slice beef very tender and the accompaniments (bean sprouts, basil, jalapenos, onions, lime and of course the noodles) were great.  This was not my Montreal pho, but did it ever hit the spot.  The gui cuon were wonderful with a nice peanut/fish sauce for dipping.  

The chicken lo mein was excellent!  Not your garden variety dark brown sauce over pasta noodles, the sauce and the chicken had the same subtle flavor as the pho and again, the fresh vegetables in it put the dish over the edge.  My step-daughter loves lo mein and she gave it two thumbs up.

I can&#39;t comment on the pork and shrimp dish as I saved it for a lunch, but the forkful that I did have was delicious.

So glad that we have a local spot for when my pho meter gets low, but the rest of the menu is going to get a work out as well."

I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect but I pulled in and found a very generic place. Nothing calling to me that I was going to enjoy Vietnamese food. Sadly, this place failed to stand out....4 Vietnamese items on the menu....Probably 10 or more Chinese dishes. That should have been my first red flag. No alcohol or BYOB....then again I didn&#39;t specifically ask but nothing on the menu that stated otherwise.  I&#39;d love to have some Tiger or &#34;33&#34; to complement the food. 

Soda...in cans and no refills. Water...plentiful if you asked for it. 

I try the Spring Rolls and Beef Pho....Now, the rolls were good, but too much lettuce and I had the peanut sauce. The Pho...over priced which was average at best. The beef was rubbery and hard to chew. 

Service, attentive as much as possible. I won&#39;t get into being charged 3 times on my debit card. That&#39;s another story.."

We had the Pho Bo Tai that came with a generous plate of fresh basil, fresh cilantro, fresh Jalapeno slices, bean sprouts, and limes.  We also had the Chicken Lo Mein that was very good and vietnamese egg rolls with lettuce and traditional sauce.  Just loved it!  There are about 22 seats inside, so it is quite quaint.  They even have a drive-thru for carry out!  And the servers and owners are super sweet and very accommodating.  We truly enjoyed our lunch at Vietnam Gate."

The food is pretty good however we did wait for quite awhile for the 5 of us. When I say a while it really took 30 minutes for us all to get pur food which came out at 3 different times. Server was very nice but was very overwhelmed and seeing how long the food took I am sure the cook was as well. I was a bit concerned that there would be no one to help serve, bus or handle checks to help this young lady out.

Pho- was ok, def overpriced. 

I liked how you can mix and match chinese combos with rice for $6! that was a plus. Chinese food was decent.

I enjoyed the springrolls, a bit pricey.

Interesting drive thru menu, but its one lane for all who are exiting, not a good thing.

Fairly fast service, real nice workers.

Because of closeness I&#39;d make stops here.

Other Yelpers have posted wonderful things about the pho, and they&#39;re right. I was sick last month and needed REAL comfort food - good, hot soup - and not that stuff in a can I keep &#39;just in case.&#39; Miserable as I was, it was worth getting dressed and driving to Vietnam Gate, just for an order of the beef pho. So delicious, and I had enough for three big servings. The spring rolls are awesome, too. Huge, fresh, and delicious. 

Only one thing I wish was different, and that&#39;s the drive through situation. I&#39;m never sure if they&#39;re aware a customer is waiting to place an order or not. But the place is still getting its bearings so I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll hammer out any issues. I&#39;m a fan, regardless."

First, it&#39;s not a design destination. It&#39;s a homely little bump with the emphasis on &#34;home&#34;. There&#39;s a little twisty-turny path you have to drive through to get to the parking lot, but when you get there, it&#39;s a large easy lot. When you get inside, it&#39;s not pretty. It&#39;s not a dirty shithole, but it&#39;s not an inviting room either. The host was very pleasant. I glanced at the brief menu, and it was easy to make up my mind. Spring Rolls and Beef Pho. As everything was pretty much in English, it was clear this joint is catering towards occidentals. OK. Fine. 
There were a number of boilerplate Chinese things which made me think these might be Frozen Chun-King meals that would be finished by &#34;Chef Mike&#34; and scraped into bowls. Why would a Vietnamese joint have 5 Vietnamese dishes and 10 Chinese?
There were people in the place, and more coming in, as I got my spring rolls. Wow, they were fab, nice and girthy with a fab Peanut sauce. I also used the Hoisin and Sriracha on the table. Great flavor and great texture. As good as I&#39;ve had!
I&#39;ve had more elaborate Pho, but this one was very good. The garnish plate left me enough extra debris to customize the bowl. 
I had a Diet Coke with, and they do it in cans. Why is this significant? No free refills!
It wasn&#39;t on the menu, but I asked for Vietnamese coffee. There was a bit of language sparring, &#39;cos I didn&#39;t want to get hung with a cup of insipid restaurant brew. They actually have the iced and the hot versions. I got the hot one, and after a slight wait, i sampled it. It was really fab. The place was great, and I&#39;ll be back very soon!!"

One of them was a carry out, the other a sit down. They are a very clean place and service is gracious too, so good points for that !  Request - please keep up the cleanliness and good service - it&#39;s important for the long term success ! 

The food is average. Their fried rice and lo mein are close to the American-Chinese versions, so were not a surprise, even though I was told they would be more of the Vietnamese style. I must say the dishes were low in soy sauce and MSG in general, so at least that was better. 

The pho was good, my first time eating pho, so can&#39;t compare at this point. However they charged extra for an extra request of some bean sprouts and I didn&#39;t think that was fair. Bean sprouts are cheap and a little bit extra, especially for a large group of people, should come free. 

The portions are okay, could do a little better on adding a little more to the lo mein dish especially because this is not some combo dish. 

This place has good prospects if they strike a rapport with their regulars. It&#39;s critical that they distinguish themselves from the typical Chinese fast food place (of which there are numerous in Aurora, at stone&#39;s throw from Vietnam Gate) ! It would be better for them to expand and popularize their Vietnamese menu and not the Chinese ones, because that&#39;s what going to make them different from the average fast food spot in that area. 

I am hopeful that this place will prosper given that they take at least some of the above comments in a constructive way. The folks running this place seem hard working and polite and I wish them success in this new venture !"

I had a bahn mi beef sandwich...delicious tender spiced meat, crisp veggies, toasted roll... would have again in a heart beat at $5.50. The beef pho broth smelled so good, Chinese five spice I think. Came with a pile of fresh basil, cilantro, lime, and sprouts to add. The bowl was so large I took leftovers for lunch for $10 good deal.

A friend of mine is visiting the Chicago area from Philly for the first time and had a list of Chicago things to try. And somehow, Malort had made its way on there. If you don&#39;t know, Malort is a hometown liquor, Swedish in origin, made from wormwood and almost impossible to get outside of Chicago. So she (and my intrepid boyfriend) decided they had to try it. I called around and the Lantern was able to supply us, so we trekked down one night for a snootful. 

Now, I only had a tiny sip of theirs.  But we had read things about &#34;The Malort face&#34; (due to its bitterness) and wanting more despite its awful taste. I can safely tell you that none of us wanted another round, and our kindly waitress commiserated with us about it afterward. (The Lantern must do a business in Malort, though, because you can by t-shirts that say &#34;I Got Malorted at The Lantern&#34; -- it&#39;s right up on the wall over the bar!)

As to the bar itself, this is a casual corner hangout: dark, wood walls, free popcorn machine, darts and other gaming, Cubs game on all the TVs (occasionally inspiring deafening roars from the crowd). I&#39;ve lived in Naperville for years and have never once been here, but some of my neighbors love it, and it definitely provided in this instance!

Of course it was fairly busy during the late afternoon on St. Patricks Day. I met some friends there who had been there for about 20 minutes before I arrived. Chris came over with a round of beers and quickly disappeared without noticing that two people including myself had joined the table. I&#39;ve been a server before so I always give people a break when it comes to crappy service. What we received wasnt just crappy service, but appalling how disrespectful and rude Chris was to us. After trying to flag her down multiple times for a drink, I finally went to the bar. I finally got Chris to stop at our table and I asked for a menu because I wanted food. She brought over a menu and stood there while I scanned it over. I had never been here before so I wasnt sure what I wanted. When I asked if she could give me a minute, she rudely threw her hands up in the air and grunted loudly. She came back a couple minutes later and I had decided that we were going to leave after being treated so poorly. She yells &#34;REALLY&#34; right in our faces and stomps away like a 12 year old. Mind you, Chris is 61 years old, as she proudly told us later in our interaction. 

Chris&#39;s attitude towards her guests rivals that of a server at Ed Debevics. She is rude, crass and has no respect. I wont even get into the screaming she engaged  in when one of our friends asked what her problem was. She asked where we served so she could come over there and give us hell.

I confronted the manager who came and apologized as Chris has an &#34;off putting sense of humor&#34;. I&#39;m sorry, but if you know your server is like this, you shouldnt continue her employment. 

We will NEVER return and will tell friends and family to do the same. There are so many other great spots in Downtown Naperville who actually treat their customers with respect."

Neither is basic beer specials (Bud or Miller), but somehow the Lantern has survived and thrived in downtown Naperville.  That&#39;s probably due to the fact that it isn&#39;t as pretentious as some bars, and wannabes can talk about their favorite &#34;dive&#34; bar.  Look, Napervillians, just because a bar doesn&#39;t have a martini list does NOT make it a dive bar.

The Lantern was super crowded on the Monday before Christmas, which is the total opposite of what was happening at Features.  The interior is dark, with large uncomfortable wooden booths.  It isn&#39;t a dump or a dive, it&#39;s actually rather clean, but there just isn&#39;t anything going on here.

Underwhelming.  Crowded.  Not a great hangout spot for large groups.  They had some bar food specials, like sliders for $1.  Meh."

Nothing too fancy but it gets the job done... Bar food, darts, beer, TVs, and free popcorn... Pretty much what everyone else has said. A divey-bar in the heart of Naperville.

The only reason I don&#39;t give it a 5 is sometimes the bartenders don&#39;t seem to give a crap about you and act like they&#39;re doing you a favor. This isn&#39;t all of the time, however, so I usually look past this."

Exceptionally friendly folks staffing a cozy and totally unpretentious joint that is well appointed with large screens featuring sporting events and serving cheap but high quality food. That is my interpretation of The Lantern&#39;s mission statement-and it is delivered  all day, every day.

I&#39;ve been hanging out at the Lantern since before I was legally able, back when ID checking consisted of a bouncer making a split second determination as to whether or not you looked to be 21.  Let&#39;s call it 1982.  And, while I don&#39;t frequent the place, I never tire of popping in for a few beers and a Jalapeno Cheeseburger in the company of a few homeys.  Last night, dinner for three and three beers each tallied a remarkable $57 BT (before tip).  Talk about value...

It&#39;s a much better place on summer weekdays, after college has adjourned for the year, because there is a pronounced dearth of elitist fraternity/sorority scumbags (to borrow a line from Rob Downey Jr in &#34;Back to School&#34; (filmed at my alma mater, btw)).

But it&#39;s not.  You hope it&#39;s going to be a great dive bar.  But it isn&#39;t.  You hope it&#39;ll have some character, but it doesn&#39;t.  Instead, what it is is just sad.  The liquor selection is...blah.  I don&#39;t expect microbrews and bottles of Pappy on the top shelf.  However, I do expect to be able to get some form of decent bourbon.  I do expect that the bartenders know how to make a few drinks.  Instead, this place is the lowest common denominator.  Cheap beers to get folks coming in.  Just dive-y enough to pull in the &#34;I&#39;m not going to Bar Louie&#34; crowd.  One of those horrible computerized jukeboxes that holds nothing but current top 10 hits, so you&#39;re subjected to a wall of cheesy pop and new country, played just loud enough to make you strain to talk with your friends.  It&#39;s not terrible by any means.  But it&#39;s also not inspiring by any stretch.  

If the Lantern was a car, it would be a beige Chevy Malibu on a rental lot.  If it was a band, it&#39;d be The Offspring.  If it was clothing, it&#39;d be a sweater from JC Penney.  If you want a cheap Bud Light or a Rum and Coke, this is your bar, I guess."

Okay, so this is not a bar where I would expect to be hearing Usher on the overhead--but still. Local flavor is just what the doctor ordered when you step inside and are in the mood for a beer. Inside is casual and cool, a place where you could have a total love affair with a pint and a belly full of laughs.

And food...apparently they have some. This I&#39;m not sure of, but even so. I met up with a friend and we sat in one of the wooden booths sipping cold ones and getting caught up. The bartenders are fun, there&#39;s ample seating...and there&#39;s sports playing on the many TV screens.

You really can&#39;t complain about a bar like this in Naperville. In the sea of upscale eateries, frilly cocktails and Hooters--you can find yourself getting comfortable in the medium. 

The Lantern is the medium. And that is a-okay.

After that, she was long gone and we had to venture through the bachelor parties and pub crawlers to get our drinks.  It wasn&#39;t terrible though.  The bartender got to us quickly and we were able to make the best of it.  

When we arrived at 10pm, the noise level was manageable.  All the booths and bar stools were full.  But not more than 30 minutes later, the place was packed.  And you couldn&#39;t hear a word from across the table.  Even if you shouted.  It wasn&#39;t the music, it was the sheer volume of too many people in a tiny space all talking at the same time.

Anyways, now back to my review ;)

I just don&#39;t get it...  The place is a typical &#39;hole in the wall&#39;...  It can get really crowded and that popcorn machine...  Yikes!

People can be obnoxious here...  Its loud...  Just not fun for me!  To many 21 year olds walking around with newly-minded drivers licenses trying to pick up every woman that walks in the door.

The second star is for people watching!"

Drink prices are on par with other bars in the area and the drinks are mixed well. The staff here is friendly and let people have a good time.

This is a great place to unwind while watching all the &#34;brahs&#34; that are heading over to bar louie.  Great atmosphere with a lovely laid back and throw a couple cold ones down feeling.  Not sure if Naperville can handle this kind of pure American greatness, but I&#39;m sure this place will be around for a very long while.

During the week this place is not as busy , even into the night.  The weekends do crowd up, but its the type of crowd you do not mind getting stuck with.  Overall, excellent bar."

For those that can, you will understand. Everyone goes to a bar for different things... If you are going for college kids, or those people that thought they were cool in HS and forgot to grow up, perfect for you. I try to avoid this scene whenever possible. For me it was a bunch of amateurs that did not know how to hold their liquor. Not a great beer selection, and the bartenders were not well versed. Over 25? Look somewhere else."

If you&#39;ve just turned 21, you might enjoy this place - it&#39;s got plenty of frats/DBs trying desperately to score.  I had to kiss my boy in front of a group of guys, and even then they didn&#39;t quite get the hint.

The two stars is for the delicious beer I had, Goose Island&#39;s Nut Brown Ale.  But other than that, this place was pretty terrible.  $4.50 for a beer but $7.50 for a shitty glass of box/house/bad red wine?  No dice. 

If you&#39;re from around here, I&#39;m told this place was a hit growing up to hit at the end of the night.  I&#39;m sure it&#39;s just as packed as it was years back, and with a similar crowd.  No way I&#39;d return to this place.  I&#39;d rather go to Bar Louie."

We are not local so we were pretty amazed of the many people and families coming on a Sunday. The ambience is below standard, the rooms were musty (perhaps from the rain) and the air was thick. The service was average at best. I guess the more regular the better and faster service. Chairs uncomfortable and......
Turns out the fried chicken and Holly the balloon lady are the two big draws.
We of course had the fried chicken and also tried the burgers.
The food is pretty plain and basic american fare (except from they apparently  have an outstanding mexican night which we yet have to try). Chicken very greasy and nothing to write home about. In fact it didn&#39;t taste that wonderful so we didn&#39;t finish it."

Great burgers with plenty choices for sides.  I think the Reuben is about as good at it gets.  Grilled rye bread with plenty of meat, cheese, and a dab of kraut, horseradish and Russian dressing on the side, again with choice of side dish.  The Cobb salad is almost enough to share with a grilled piece of chicken breast on top.  The Buffalo wings are actually pretty dang good, but I like the sauce on the side.  Sometimes as a special, they have deep fried pork cutlet sandwich that is very tasty.  The tuna melt is nicely filled, and again the bread is grilled.  On a cold night, I crave their chili and add cheese and onions.

Prices are super reasonable for food.  Nearly everything on the menu is under $6 and that INCLUDES the TAX!!!  

Super nice and accommodating staff from the manager on down.  They love families with kids, (but not after 9pm).  Great to come here for Bears games!  People line up outside the door waiting to come in.  Great atmosphere.

Though it was late afternoon, I was surprised that I was the only diner. I was seated in a booth near a window with the shutters closed. It was a nice private spot.

The pizza I ordered was a thin crust with black olive, pepperoni, and onion. Based on my pizza and the numerous other pizza pictures on Yelp, Braconi&#39;s does a great job with visual presentation. My pizza was very photogenic! They layered a generous amount of black olives all over the pizza. The balance of pepperoni, onion, cheese, and sauce was to my liking as well. The crust was crispy on the ends and the pizza itself held together well enough that you could eat the end pieces without utensils and not have a mess. I thoroughly enjoyed it and what made the experience even better was they offered a Yelp check-in deal! It was 15% off a purchase of $20 or more. I&#39;d definitely return."

I found really great reviews on here and a coupon code so decided to give it a shot.

We ordered the fried ravioli as an appetizer. They were good but 8 half moon ravioli for $8 isn&#39;t really worth it. The marinara sauce was decent.

For pizza, we ordered the signature with sausage and basil. We ordered it well done on a wheat crust. Pizza was very good but I&#39;d like to try regular crust or even stuffed next time. 

UPDATE: I visited Braconis again, and I need to recommend the chopped salad. The amount of add-ins and dressing is perfect. 

We also tried the regular crust but ask for the pizza well done so it ended up tasting close to the wheat. The amount of toppings is perfect and it&#39;s priced great.

I was craving a Margherita style pizza, so I decided to try a small Bruschetta pizza, which is has chopped fresh tomatoes, fresh basil, olive oil and fresh garlic. They make you choose an additional topping (for an extra charge, of course), so I went with extra basil. I figured this was the closest thing to a Margherita pizza. 

My doorbell rang at 6:40 (!!). After signing for my order, and wishing the driver a good night, I opened the box. I was very pleased to see TONS of basil on my pizza. I didn&#39;t even grab a plate, I picked up a piece right then and there to sample. Oh my. The pizza was GOOD. I mean, wow. The basil was fresh, the cheese was neither sparse nor was it copious. The tomatoes were subtle in flavor, letting the basil be the star of this show. There was a hint of fresh garlic, which was a nice surprise. I l-o-v-e garlic, but I was afraid it would overtake the other ingredients. This was not the case. 

I am so glad I gave Braconi&#39;s a chance. My order was perfect, delivery was quicker than expected, the quality of the ingredients exceeded my expectations, and the driver was the kindest soul ever. I can&#39;t wait to order from here again and try some of their other menu items."

Really enjoy the food at this restaurant, ingredients are fresh, service is always friendly and quick.

 My favorite pizza is a good old Shrimp and Mushroom pizza (try it!)... Braconi&#39;s is the only place in Naperville that I have found which puts on huge chunks of fresh shrimp and not a bunch of mini canned shrimp! 

I have only tried their thin crust pizza, I have not tried the stuffed. Pasta here was also very good, in fact everything we have tried has been great here. 

We found this place one night buying Christmas tree&#39;s at the lot next door and glad we came in for a nice warm meal!

There were only a handful of other dining parties in a spacious restaurant. The music was atrocious &#34;heavy metal&#34;, but the waitress was willing to change it to something nicer when we complained. 

The two of us ordered a Braconi&#39;s chopped salad to share, a cup each of beef barley soup and minestrone soup, Mama Braconi&#39;s special pasta, and eggplant parmesan. Service was cordial and efficient. Our meal was served in proper sequence without any delays.

None of the dishes was better than fair to good, none of them tasted particularly home-made or excelled. The soup was overcooked, and tasted about as ordinary as canned soup. The chopped salad was better, with a nice balsamic dressing, but no better than three stars. The two main course dishes were tired and tasted commercial. We weren&#39;t expecting a Spiaggia or Taylor Street experience, but we were expecting a definite cut above Olive Garden and Carrabas - both of which we would rate solid 3&#39;s. Unfortunately, this restaurant barely made our 2 scale - a mix of just fair to, at best just good, food. 

We wish that our $50 for the two of us (incl tax &amp; tip) would have purchased a better and more authentically Italian meal."

On one of our last visits together we got delivery from there &amp; pigged out.  It was a good time!  When my mom passed away shortly after that in 2007, we had a dinner here after her funeral.  

The staff were really great to me.  The banquet room was already occupied so they let our family have several tables in the dining room and I just had everybody order their own meals from the menu since money was tight.  The workers all remembered my mom &amp; told me some good stories about when they had seen her come in.  One included how she was &#34;dancing&#34; in her wheelchair to the music &amp; enjoyed a drink in the bar.

I also spent some time in the bar during the dinner.  It seemed like the right thing to do to have some drinks in her honor.

I received great service in both the restaurant &amp; bar and was touched that everyone seemed to remember my mom who passed from this earth too soon.  While I was still in town after her funeral, a friend of mine &amp; I got delivery from Braconi&#39;s one last time.  It was bittersweet since she wasn&#39;t there, but the food was very good &amp; it was soothing to eat it one more time.  

I would definitely recommend Braconi&#39;s to anyone planning a trip to Naperville.  And I would also suggest using their banquet services if you are local.  Top notch service.  Thank you, Braconi&#39;s."

The Potato Skins are delish!
The chocolate cake is mediocre.

The stuffed pizza was as fantastic back home in Wisconsin as it was when served to us in Naperville the night before.

I ordered the buffalo chicken pizza with extra hot sauce. The weird thing is came out to the table and offered next to no flavor. There was no heat from the buffalo chicken. Just cheddar cheese oozing all over the place, which isn&#39;t bad if that&#39;s what I wanted; alas, it was not. 

Salad was decent though and so was the spinach dip. But if pizza you want, I&#39;d go with something other than the buffalo chicken pizza of not another place altogether.

The people I was with were all very mixed in their opinions. The soups and salad were good, the pasta was just so-so and the service was average too. Not too likely to come back here given the options available but if the kids want to do, I&#39;d go and get a salad."

This is the first time I have ever ordered from Braconi South. My initial impression is that they care more about getting pizza&#39;s out the door than they care about the quality of the food. 

I ordered by phone for pick up a small, thin cheese pizza for my kids and a stuffed veggie pizza for my wife and I. The woman on the phone said it would be ready in 25 minutes. I thought to myself, &#34;Gosh, that is rather quick for a stuffed pizza to be ready. Thin crust, okay, but stuffed, WOW! They must have a super high-speed efficient pizza oven.&#34; Sure enough, when I brought the pizzas back home both the thin cheese and stuffed pizza were undercooked. I am not sure how you undercook a thin cheese pizza but they figured it out. The dough on the stuffed was spongy and undercooked and you also tell that the dough on the thin cheese pizza was undercooked. Even the cheese on the thin pizza looked as if it never reached the bubbling point.

I will say this, the taste was good once we finished cooking the pizza. I believe this location has been open for some time so I am not sure if anyone else has experienced the same issue as I did.  

Questions:
Q: Will I go back? 
A. Not to this location. Maybe the location on Royal Saint George is better.

Q. Was the staff friendly
A. No problems there. The women who took the order and the cashier (one in the same I believer) couldn&#39;t have been more friendly.

Q. Did I call and complain?
A. No, I would rather post my comments publicly like everyone else these days.

Q. Would I recommend?
A. No. But if you do order be sure to tell them you want your pizza fully cooked."

That&#39;s verbatim, how is that a legitimate excuse? I respectfully agree to disagree, I won&#39;t share my true feelings on that statement or what exactly happened for fear of it being completely rejected and not informing people of what happened....truly, I&#39;m disappointed and sad to say, most likely will not be back...sorry folks, enjoy the remainder of your Labor Day weekend."

It&#39;s a locally owned place that has been around for a while.  The first thing you notice when you walk in is that it is a pizza place first and foremost.  The carryout/delivery desk is right at the front.  There is a very small bar area (2-3 seats).  The rest of the dining room isn&#39;t anything special.  the booths are VERY uncomfortable...ask for a table if possible.  

The waitstaff is always attentive and helps you when you need it.  They always seem to be overstaffed, which isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing.  

On to the food.  As i mentioned...pizza is king here.  It tastes awesome, comes out fast and is decently priced.  The pasta dishes are also pretty good; we tried the chicken and veal parmigiana.  Most dishes come w/ a side of angel hair, which are usually caked in oil/butter, but taste good.  

Aside from that, the other dishes are not very good...  I ordered the grilled salmon dish; BIG mistake.  Stay away from that.  It sure isn&#39;t grilled; i think it was microwaved or baked.  VERY and I mean VERY dry and it was kinda crusty.  When we saw that and I took my first bite, I asked them to kindly take it back and have another one made.  It came out the exact same.  Quite disappointing (esp. being the most expensive item on the menu).  We ordered the calamari for an appetizer.  It was ok, nothing to write home about.  The salads aren&#39;t that great either; small and use iceberg lettuce that is too &#39;light&#39;...no mixed greens or spinach of any sort.  I do want to say though that tiramisu was very tasty, surprised me.  I would definitely order that again.  

So yes, this place has awesome pizza and good pasta.  Aside from that though, it&#39;s not that great.  Stick w/ pizza and it&#39;s a good place!"

Mama Braconi (?) always greets us and is super friendly. She even sat with me once while I was waiting for my husband. Granted she talked about her foot problems, but  this just added to the magical experience that  I was visiting my grandma, with the added bonus of a buffet! And, just like my grandma, she always asks if we&#39;ve had enough to eat before we walk out. 

We have only been for the lunch buffet, and since I love having large amounts of food to choose from, I am usually a happy camper. The crust could be better, it tastes a little like saltines and I wish there was more to it. I would love having Lou&#39;s crust with Braconi&#39;s sauce. That would be a dream come true. 

Prices are decent and there is a lot of variety. The pastas and other chicken/fish/salad dishes are fine, may not be top specialty restaurant quality, but they are good for the price. They have a large variety of pies for dessert, and since I love pie so I much, I would have it instead of birthday cake growing up, this makes me joyful. 

I WISH that they would re-decorate! It has a horrible feeling of a 70&#39;s bowling alley lounge and is always dark, and not in the fancy mood-lighting kind of way. I think that would help a lot with bringing new customers in"

We sat outside for over 15 minutes before I had to go in and find a server. 5 minutes later still no server and I have to ask again. Drink order was messed up, food order was not correct and I am still waiting on that fried ravioli to show up. The waitress completely ruined our entire experience. She never apologized and after sitting there for an hour and a half ( we ordered salads and appetizers and only half of them showed up) I had to go in and ask for the bill twice. Worst experience I have had dining in a long time. And they were not busy.

But the reason I will never go back is because mice were running around under our table. Yes I know we were outside and animals might show up, but there were a lot of mice. Too bad because the food was decent."

I have to admit that I did not expect much from a pizza joint in a suburban strip mall, but Braconi&#39;s was delicious.  The group I visited with all ordered the lunch buffet.  It consisted of an array of cold salads, several different types of pizza (including deep dish), broasted chicken, and pasta.  The cold pasta salad was very good as was each piece of pizza I tried.  Even the broasted chicken was moist and wonderful.

All of the food is very good quality.  You almost forget that you&#39;re eating a buffet.  I particularly love the potato salad (with bacon!), the great brownies, and home made donuts that I would kill for.  Did I mention that it&#39;s one of my favorite pizza crusts?

The first was a dinner with friends and the second was lunch with family.  Place is nice inside, nothing special. It has a small bar and bar eating area.  It has a typical dining area and a small separate party room.  It has an open kitchen and things look fairly organized and clean.
Lets start with the dinner experience.  We had small pizza as an appetizer.  Pizza was delicious.  I would say some of the best in the Fox Valley area.  Entrees were also delicious and the size was very large.  We all had a take home meal. Price for 4 with 2 drinks each and a dessert to split $111 without tip.   So, 5 stars on the dinner.  Had such a great time and food we came back for a follow up lunch 2 weeks later.  Came for the $9 lunch buffet.  Buffet is kind of on the smaller size, but they do a nice job to get a good variety out there.  They had about 4 salads, 2 pasta dishes and about 4-5 different pizzas.  Plus, 3 desserts to choose from.  Buffet is from 11-2 and we got there around 12:25.  Buffet was about 85% empty and pizza was looking pretty crispy from sitting out under the heat lamps.
Salads were all almost empty.  Pasta seemed fine, but it&#39;s pasta.  It keeps well in a covered chafing dish.  Here is were the problem starts.  It starts with the waitress.  I mentioned to her about the condition of the buffet and she responds that it opens at 11 and they don&#39;t want to waste food.  I understand not wanting to waste food, but there is no excuse not to have any cheese,pepperoni or sausage pizza out there.  No excuse to have empty or almost empty salad bowls.  I worked in the food business for 27 years.  Her excuse is not what you tell the customers.  A buffet table should never sit less than 50% empty and if it looks unappetizing, remove it from the table.  Rotate your salads.  Never run out of cheese, sausage or pepperoni pizzas.  Make half and half pizzas if you are that slow.  Make smaller size pizzas if you are that slow. A buffet not only has to taste fresh, but it has to look fresh too.  We ended up ordering off the menu.  The only highlight of that lunch was, who I guess was the owner or the mother of the owner.  She was super friendly and sat with us when we came in and came around a couple times to chat.  That is what is missing from restaurants today. 
Kudos for that.  To sum up the lunch experience, waitress excuses, lack of caring and overall attitude..... totally unacceptable.  Condition of the buffet and freshness....totally unacceptable.  Lunch bill for 3 was $38 without tip.
I would give lunch a 1 star.  For the owners: 01/21/14. Table 54. Seat 1 Chk #12 receipt Tanya G.  Hope that helps them correct that problem.  Not sure if we would go back for the buffet. Great pizza!"

I tell you that as I spend a lot of dinners in restaurants all over.  I had a taste for Egg Plant Parm and looked up various places and settled on Braconi&#39;s.  Atmosphere was OK.  Service was good.  But that&#39;s kind of were it ended.  Egg Plant was almost invisible smothered in a thick sauce.  Pasta filled over 70% of the plate and I had two added meatballs that the wait staff told me would melt in my mouth.  Not the case.  Salad was to have Balsamic Vinegariette  that turned out to be vinegar.  Sorry I can&#39;t rate this higher because I had some high hopes.

The atmosphere is nice.  It isn&#39;t anything fancy, nor is it run down in any way.  It&#39;s a good place to grab a nice lunch.

The service is top notch.  The folks who work here are extremely pleasant and very helpful.  They are always ready to greet you when you walk through the door, which is nice.

The food is good.  They have a wide variety of pizza available in the buffet as well as 3-4 salads and 2 other entrees at the end of the line.  The entrees are traditional Italian fare like pasta, and they are generally good.  There is also dessert in the form of cakes and brownies available.  Those are very good.  I usually focus on the pizza and have always been impressed with it.  They have a bunch of variety from the normal sausage and pepperoni to buffalo chicken and bruschetta. I would highly recommend the BBQ chicken if you have a chance.  It&#39;s my favorite for sure.

The price is reasonable, coming in at right around $10.  It&#39;s an all you can eat deal, so no one should leave hungry.

If you are looking for a good pizza buffet at lunch time, I can&#39;t think of a better option than this one."

We just moved into the area, so were hoping to find a good neighborhood restaurant that could deliver good food at a reasonable price that we could use as a standard going forward.  And.... yes, the restaurant did meet our expectations.

The interior decor reminded me a bit of a pizza place we used to eat in the 80s, which somehow made me more comfortable. The service was very friendly and we got our drink orders right away - like 30 seconds after seating. There are quite a few options on the menue, so we debated for a while and went with a deep dish spinach pizza and a thin crust bbq chicken pizza (yes we are pigs sometimes). 

We had to wait a long time for the pizza - that is really major negative I experienced. It would have been better if the waitress had given us a heads up on how long we should expect to wait.... we would have ordered an appetizer as we were really hungry.

Pizza was pretty good. I wouldn&#39;t say it was &#39;great&#39; - thus the four stars vs. five. All around I&#39;d go back regularly. They have a big menu selection and good prices. I&#39;m a fan!"

The mozzarella sticks were ok, but the cheese wasn&#39;t very warm so it was like eating fried string cheese, just a big clump of cheese that didn&#39;t melt well enough for my liking. But the sauces were yummy to dip it all in, so it made up for the hard cheese. We also had garlic bread which tasted good, nothing unusual or out of this world, just good regular garlic bread. 

Then came the pizza! We had tons of choices, all pipping hot and very tasty. I liked the ratio of cheese and sauce, neither one over powered the other. I also liked the cornmeal on the bottom of the crusts, it gave it an interesting texture and an unique taste. 

The staff was friendly and understanding of our large group and we didn&#39;t feel rushed to hurry up and leave. Which is very appreciated when you are visiting for someone&#39;s birthday. 

The decor is very casual but you also wouldn&#39;t feel out of place in a nicer outfit either. They have a great outdoor patio area that I think can be really fun on summer nights. 

All in all, pretty good. I wouldn&#39;t make a special trip out to Naperville just to eat at Braconi&#39;s but if I was in town I would partake in their pizza and fried zucchini if someone asked!"

Instead of ordering the same old same old, we decided to try this place.  BIG MISTAKE!!!!  We placed our order and an hour later the delivery driver called.  He was lost, and in fact on the other side of town.  45 minutes later we called the restaurant, and the manager told us that the driver had just pulled up.  Ten minutes later he actually arrived.  I was on the phone with the manager when he arrived and instead of offering at least an apology, he argued with me that I had given them the wrong address, and all but told me to shove it.  I have ordered numerous time from Grub Hub and NEVER had this problem.  I think I&#39;m aware of where I live.  Then, famished, my sister, boyfriend and son sat down to eat.  Not to any suprise, all the food was cold, and the only reason we ate it was that we were too hungry not to.  Accidents happen, drivers get lost, I work in the service industry and have made mistakes myself.  What is unacceptable is a manager arguing with me and not making any effort to rectify the situation.  I would be immediately terminated for something like that.  The food was awful at best, the management is horrible.  That was the first and last time I ever waste money there.  (and we did pay the FULL amount, including delivery charge)"

I got carryout so I can&#39;t comment on the restaurant portion but, the inside had a casual, but quiet vibe to it.  The pizza was just ok.  There was something about the crust that ruined it for me.  Was it the graininess bottom from the corn meal or the overall lack of flavor?  Who knows.

I must admit, that the portions were generous, but what is the point of having generous portions when the food is tasteless. The service was Ok. The pizza crust was very dry, burnt and the Pizza tasteless. The breaded combo platter was too greasy, saltless and flavorless. The chicken was very chewy and the sauce bland.

We live in Northwest IN, but were in the area while waiting on my daughter and her friend, who went to Zero Gravity Teen Club. We were looking for a place that was open late, and Braconi&#39;s sure is! That was a big deciding factor for us, since we didn&#39;t arrive until about 9:30 pm. My husband had the Chicken Oreganto Pasta and he just loved it! The smell was amazing and the taste even better! I am a big fan of pizza, so after I heard that they have great pizza, I just had to try it. I had the thin crust Meat Lover&#39;s pizza which had sausage, pepperoni and Canadian bacon. I ordered the medium, which is a 12&#34; pizza. It was more than enough and could have easily served 2 people. I always like to have leftovers, so I got the medium. I really enjoyed it a lot! It rates right up there with the best pizzas I&#39;ve ever had, and believe me, it&#39;s a lot of different pizzas from various parts of the world. We were pleasantly greeted by the owner of the restaurant, who took us to our seat. Our waiter was very pleasant and he did not rush us at all. We let them know that we were happy that they were open late (till 1 am on Saturday), so that we could have a place to stay for a while. The decor of  the restaurant was nice and not elaborate. They have an interesting party room in the back that has memorabilia on the wall. One of the things was a military uniform, if I&#39;m not mistaken. I guess it belonged to the Mayor of Naperville, to whom the party room is named after. He is a frequent visitor to Braconi&#39;s, so we were told. We will definitely come back here soon!"

Their TV commercials have drilled the point home to about 83% of the population, but I&#39;ll reiterate:  They&#39;ve completely redesigned their pizza recipes from the ground up. While I won&#39;t be winning any culinary awards for the following assessment, it would seem they&#39;ve basically:
1. Taken the base Papa John&#39;s recipe...
2. ...complete with addictive and mildly carcinogenic garlic sauce cup...
3. ... and added an equally addictive (if not carcinogenic) garlic buttery crust to every pizza by default.

As ridiculous as it sounds, part of the fun of &#34;The New Domino&#39;s&#34; is ordering online.  They have a hilariously over-the-top flash application that gives you (not kidding) a minute-by-minute play by play of your pizza&#39;s progress through their assembly and delivery supply chain.  

For instance:
7:24 pm:  Andrew has put your pizza into the oven.
7:32 pm:  Jason is performing Quality Control on your Freshly baked pizza.
7:35 pm:  Chauncy has left the store with your pizza.

I don&#39;t take chain-store pizza particularly seriously. No one should.  This is an example of excellence within the bounds of its genre.  So long as you don&#39;t pretend for a minute that its &#34;pizza margherita authentico&#34; you&#39;ll be very much impressed with Domino&#39;s 2.0."

My short take on Naf Naf, I really enjoyed/loved their homemade pita bread, the Chicken Shwarma were nice thin, long slices of beautifully marinaded chicken. I didn&#39;t like that they do not carry, my favorite condiment, the yogurt cucumber tzatziki sauce. I thought there was too much of the salad fixings with the hummus on my sandwich to enjoy the meat. Traditional but &#39;After all enjoying Middle Eastern food is all about the spices&#39;. After removing most of the salad fixings the meat was very flavorful and the pita was Soft,Delicious and enjoyable.

After reading reviews about Pitaville I had to give it a try. Upon arrival on a Friday night around 7pm I found this store front restaurant had a nice flow of customers and almost all of the side tables were full w mostly people who are native to this type of cuisine(A GOOD SIGN). I ordered the Chicken and Beef Shwarma. Service was pleasant and helpful. I immediately determined that the pitas are not house made because stacks of them were on the shelves, in plastic bags in the prep area. One negative. When I saw them take, what appeared to be a x-large, oval shaped pita, like a burrito tortilla, stuff it will my particulars, press it in a panini press, then further crisp it up on a flat top grill, I was suspicious. My suspicions were confirmed when I got home. Hard bread, dry chopped chicken and beef. Not a good turn from Naf Naf. Please don&#39;t chop the meat from the spit and why toast and press pita bread?

In all fairness this review is only for the items i ordered, the Chicken and Beef Shwarma&#39;s. I did hear that the meat combo(oops! w some shwarma meat), was a good choice.

Although I have my doubts about returning I can only suspect that many reviews were written by people who may have limited experience with this type of food and the natives were there because its cheaper. Just my take.  They do have yogurt cucumber tzatziki sauce!

My search will not stop at Naf Naf, it has it&#39;s shortcomings, but so far it rates higher than Pitaville for maybe a $1.00 per more. I really did like the hospitality at the register and the atmosphere is true to it&#39;s roots."

I went with the chicken schwarma wrap and a side of falafel (6 falafel per order, so it&#39;s big enough for two people to split) They make the food fresh, so it took about 15-20 minutes for my order. When it came out though, it was piping hot. The flavor of the wrap itself was mild, but once I added a little bit of the red/hot sauce they provided, it was bursting with flavor. I thought that the falafel were some of the best I&#39;ve tried.

Honestly, I saw all my fellow Yelp Elites giving this place three stars and I wondered why. I thought maybe they were being harsh or maybe it was bad days that they went, who knows? So I decided to give this place a shot anyway.... And they were so right. 

I don&#39;t compare any place to Naf Naf because they&#39;re a chain. A big chain at that, so yes, prices and quality can very at Naf Naf. I compare my falafel life to Falafelji in Lyons because they stole my falafel heart and continue to wow me. I mean, I drive 31 miles there and back just to hit up my homies at Falafelji. I mean, they&#39;re amazing. So, its hard to compete. 

But I really can&#39;t say I will be returning here. I paid .75 cents for garlic sauce that I took one bite of and didn&#39;t use again, the baba tasted like hummas, the pita was decent and nothing special, and the falafel was too fried and tasted like chicken (they do chicken nuggets... I&#39;m guessing they use the same fryer). So yeah, I&#39;m disappointed  that I spent 20 dollars for two people and it wasn&#39;t that good...at all. 

Otherwise, decor was nice, staff was friendly, and place was clean.

I had never heard of Pitaville, but words like Pita and Mediterranean always catch my eye (and my taste buds)!

The menu has a good variety. I personally tend to always choose something that includes falafel when I&#39;m at a mediterranean joint, so I went with the Falafel Wrap! I&#39;m not sure if I misjudged this place by thinking it was a fast casual restaurant, but the amount of time it took to prepare a wrap was disappointing and definitely not fast. I was the only one in the restaurant and it took a solid 10-12 minutes. Now I wasn&#39;t expecting this to be freaky-fast, but I just thought waiting that long for one wrap to be made was a tad ridiculous. 

Regardless, I grabbed my order eventually and was on my merry way. When I got home and opened the bag I was pleasantly surprised - the wrap was a lot bigger than I was expecting! It came with two sauce containers which was also highly appreciated. In a nutshell, the wrap was just okay. I&#39;ve definitely had better. 

Needless to say I finished the whole thing, but key take-a-ways were how filling the wrap was and the tasty sauces. I personally thought the falafel itself was sort of dry and tasteless and the wrap was a little burnt and blah-tasting. I would have hoped for a softer wrap and more moist falafel - to me that&#39;s a fresh taste. 

I think this place has a lot of promise, but there&#39;s definitely room for improvement when it comes to efficiency and food quality! Maybe next time I&#39;ll have to try a different menu item."
pitaville-mediterranean-grill-naperville,Saad M.,Hj-SoF7m19vNX9CMgKEE7A,"Chicago, IL",0,1,0,1,266,QCgKQZx9Q5zaQ390LOdehA,2.0,2015-10-12,"I wandered into this restaurant because I wanted a quick dinner and had noticed the four star rating on Yelp. I walked into a familiar feeling Mediterranean restaurant that stood out immediately to me due to its aesthetics: it had a well-kept dining area with a tall cobble stone wall surrounding the open kitchen and graphically pleasant menu board at the front. I ordered a beef shawarma wrap with hummus and a six piece falafel on the side totaling a little over ten dollars. The man taking my order told me my order would be ready in ten minutes and indeed after ten minutes of listening to the electrifying sizzling of the griddle and the exhilarating bubbling of the fryer, my meal was ready to devour. 

The first thing I noticed about my plate was that everything was colorful, from the vegetables inside the wrap to the bright red seasoning on the hummus. Upon taking a huge bite of the grill pressed wrap, I realized my mouth was full of mostly vegetables (lettuce, tomatoes, cucumber, and carrots). Taken by surprise, I decided to probe the so called beef wrap only to find a handful of scraps of meat. I ended up dissecting the wrap to find the meat because the pita shell had quickly become soggy and dripping with sauce like a runny faucet. The beef that was so scarcely strewn about the wrap was cooked to perfection; however, there was one major drawback. The meat was flavorless. Next, I decided to take a shot at the falafel. I took a piece and dunked it into the small pool of hummus and took an enormous bite. The falafel had a crunchy exterior and moist interior, and the hummus was thick and creamy; it was everything I had hoped for in falafel and hummus...except for one rather large weakness. Both were flavorless. As a last-ditch effort, I decided to try to the sauces accompanying my platter of surprisingly lackluster food. The tzatziki sauce played along ever so seamlessly with the central theme of my meal, no flavor. It seemed as if I was eating a generic Mediterranean sauce that had no place anywhere because adding it to my food didn&#39;t enhance or worsen the flavors (or lack thereof). Standards having been lowered, I tried a squirt of the red chili sauce and tasted absolutely nothing for a few seconds and then the spice slowly emerged from the background like a subdued buildup in a dramatic movie soundtrack. The odd thing about this sauce was that although it had spice, there was no other flavor associated with it. I don&#39;t know how it was possible to have a chili sauce that had spice with no flavor, but I wasn&#39;t really surprised at this point. 

Disappointingly reflecting on the meal I had just eaten, I felt a bit out of place because it was as if my taste buds had been taken away from me prior to this Mediterranean trek. Needless to say, there were rudimentary seasonings missing from every item I had ordered.  The irony in all this being that there is a grocery store named Spice Mart that shares a wall with this restaurant. If only they had shared more than a wall. The optimist in me felt like maybe I hadn&#39;t chosen the right items or I hadn&#39;t come on a good time of the day or day of the week, but I realized that after this experience, I would most likely not return to search for any truth in that thought."

Maybe it isn&#39;t entirely their fault; my appetite has been non-existent until the evening hours, so trying to grab something for lunch has been a challenge lately. 

I entered Pitaville and attempted to quickly decide on something to eat. My usual at any place with &#34;Pita&#34; in their name is a chicken kebab sandwich, or something similar. But today I decided to go with a small Jerusalem salad, which contains cucumber, tomatoes, parsley, garlic, olive oil &amp; sesame paste. I wasn&#39;t diggin&#39; the sesame paste idea but I thought I&#39;d give it a go. The man who took my order asked if I wanted pita bread with my salad and I told him &#34;sure.&#34;

About five minutes later, my order was ready. Now, I know I ordered a small, but I had envisioned something a bit bigger than I received. After all, it&#39;s just vegetables really. I guess the cost would be from the olive oil and sesame paste.
As expected, my tastebuds weren&#39;t delighted with the sesame paste. I ate about a third of the salad and gave up. So then I tried the pita bread, and unfortunately was met with the same stiff, thin, and definitely not fresh bread many other reviewers encountered.  It came with a tiny container of some kind of watery sauce. To say I was disappointed was an understatement, but seeing as how I paid a little less than $6 for the salad and a bottle of water, I guess I got what I paid for. 

The restaurant itself was clean, and fairly spacious. The man who took my order was nice, as was the employee who gave me my order. I might give this place another chance when my appetite has returned to normal, but will avoid the pita bread."

The service was decent and preparing the meal was relatively quick. I know you have to make it fresh so I can be a little more patient with it versus a place that is a little more busy on occasion.

The food was good. However I called to place an order for delivery. The gentleman stated all deliverys need to  be submitted online. OK so I place my order through yelp at 5:49pm. I receive my confirmation email at 6:09pm. An hour later I call pitaville directly from yelps listed phone number to check on the delivery. The young man I spoke to had difficulty finding my order then said that I ordered an entree even though I thought I ordered my fiancee a sandwich. He stated that by the amount I was charged it was definitely an entree. FINE he said that he would see to it I received my food in 30 min. I did get the food by 7:30pm. But when we get it, we in fact did receive only the sandwich not the entree I was told we were to expect. CONFUSED I obviously want to be sure I&#39;m refunded if I was over charged I call the same exact number I called earlier to pitaville. The man who answered this time says I need to contact s 3rd party delivery express? That that&#39;s who I called earlier. But I simply clicked in my iPhone the same number labeled &#34; pitaville &#34; I contacted just 30 min prior. So they give a number but the number provided was not who they claimed id be contacting.

I usually get the lunch combo.  There&#39;s plenty of food that keeps me stuffed even past supper time and it&#39;s soooo tasty.  My favorite on the combo plate is the chicken shawarma.  I have had it in the sandwich too and that&#39;s my current second favorite menu item.  I have been wanting to try their lamb kabobs but I never seem to order it but I will one of these times.

A very popular lunch place in the area. This place can be empty one minute and then packed the next.

There is &#34;another&#34; restaurant serving similar food not too far away but my suggestion is to skip that one and come here."

I won&#39;t go into it all, but I will say that if I didn&#39;t get some falafel today that bad things were going to happen. V. bad things. Things involving speaking in tongues, head spinning, and only the devil knows what else so after a quick yelp search nearby for pitas on my way to work (I&#39;d already driven waaay past Naf Naf or that would&#39;ve been my destination) and Pitaville turned up as my most convenient option. Unfortunately, I ended up trading quality and flavor for convenience. 

I paid just under $11 for the Veggie Delight pita plate- a combination of Hummus, Baba Ganoush, Falafel, Jerusalem Salad and Pita. I think I paid about $6-$8 too much but they did give me a coupon for next time in my take-out bag... but I don&#39;t know how soon that next time&#39;ll be. 

When I opened the container everything was all mixed and blended together- It was hard to tell what was what and it definitely looked like it had either been dropped or played kickball with. Sad face for the gooshy looking food but if it&#39;s good- who cares, right? Well, onto that unfortunate tale next. 

My Pitas-
What I had hoped for: Soft, pillow-y pockets
What I got: Thin, stiff, stale, and sad excuses for pita. 

My Falafel-
What I had hoped for: Crispy + Crunchy outside and a soft flavorful inside
What I got: Hard balls that tasted like they&#39;d had some level of freezer burn before being re-fried with a most disappointingly dry center. 

Hummus + Baba Ganoush + Jerusalem Salad-
What I had hoped for: Well, I certainly hadn&#39;t hoped to be reviewing them all together but since they all ran together in my mashed up container, I have no choice.
What I got: Liquid and runny hummus with a flavorless baba ganoush and wilty Jerusalem salad + a stomach ache. 

The staff was friendly and the hot sauce was decent- or at least they were generous with it (unlike their meal portions) so that&#39;s really the only saving grace here. Plus, I only had veggie things so maybe meat is more their specialty and I don&#39;t want to tip the yelpy scales too far in the wrong direction based off my limited eating habits."

I didnt like anything when my husband drug me to Naf Naf Grill, but here, I have seriously liked every single item that I&#39;ve tried (which has been almost everything). NNG DOES have better pita bread since they make it in the store, versus Pitaville using prepackaged pitas, but I can&#39;t eat it anymore anyways, so I guess that doesn&#39;t matter to me anymore.

I really can&#39;t figure out why I didn&#39;t review them back then... As you can tell  from the star rating, the memories are very pleasant.  I hope they&#39;ve maintained their quality over time, because I actually went here in their very first few days of opening.  And then a bunch of times in the following weeks; that is until I moved quite a bit away from that area.

The falafels here were excellent.  I remember they had hired a chef.  This guy was fancy shmancy.  Now the restaurant itself isn&#39;t all fancy... just seemed like a regular fast food falafel place, but the way the food was presented was awesome.  He did a great job, kinda of decorating the plate.

What I remember most about this place is one of the co-owner dudes that was usually there (Indian guy) was always very talkative and enjoyable to talk to."

Here were the differences:

1. The place itself isn&#39;t as &#34;cool&#34; and Naf Naf. It doesn&#39;t have the trendiness or open feel. If you don&#39;t care about decor, then read on.

2. The menu is basically the same as most Mediterranean-ish places, but the prices aren&#39;t cheaper even though the place looks/seems cheaper.

3. No Naf Naf fries. I mean... enough said?

4. Pita wasn&#39;t even close to as good as Naf Naf. They&#39;re practically cotton over there and at Pitaville, not-so-much.

5. My pita + filling was just plain smaller than I get when ordering at Naf Naf. 

BUT, there&#39;s one thing I think Pitaville does better: hummus. It has more flavor. But other than that, Naf wins the prize for best in the area on all other levels. 

So this place has restaurant.com and coupons... but it&#39;s not quite the Naf Naf quality. I&#39;ll pay a few dollars more for that pita, more food, and those insanely good fries."

I had a falafel pita ($4.70 with tax). It took about ten minutes to get made, but at least they made it fresh. It was a decent falafel to be sure, though I wish they had a wholewheat pita option. I wasn&#39;t a fan of their hot sauce or tahini, as neither of them had any flavor.

Still, if you&#39;re looking for a relatively quick and cheap meal in the suburbs that isn&#39;t Taco Bell, Pitaville is a good option."

I got the falafel wrap and it was pretty good. I thought it was a bit dry but then noticed the container of sauce in my to-go bag. Sweet! It was good quality for the cost.

Meat is juicy and grilled to perfection, we ordered the mixed grill platter (dinner). 
Their chicken kabobs are so mouthwatering on little skewers. Baba ganoush is always fancy. I like the wraps option that come with fries for the kids, but love my pita and rice. Their salads are so fresh! 
I come here all the time, love that they use basmati rice instead of the typical uncle bens rice which you see at most middle eastern places. 
We came late one night after shopping at fox valley and the staff was so down to earth, they put on a movie for the kids and we literally had movie night right there in the restaurant till they closed! The kids were watching &#34;the croods&#34; some new movie that just came out, on a big beautiful tv. 
As the kids were watching their movie, we ordered their hot mint tea for the adults in our group and ate baklava. 
Sad that not a lot of people know of this place, I used to go to naf naf, then discovered this place and have been a pitavillian since!
It&#39;s also nice that they always offer coupons and discounts etc. The owner has just this one restaurant, which shows that a lot of work and dedication goes to this place, as it&#39;s not a chain."

Between accidents in beds and accidentally killing the fish in the fish tank, none of us were having a very good day. We randomly stopped here not knowing what to expect but looking for an affordable lunch that wasn&#39;t deep fried and greasy.

As it happened, the 4-year old had an accident in the car and ruined our sit-down to eat. We instead took our order to go and headed home--none of us in a very good mood, except the baby. Then Kim knocked over my Dr Pepper into the back seat floor of the Jeep. When it rains...

We got home, cleaned everyone up, put the kids down for naps and had forgotten about our food. Amazingly, it was mostly still warm. 

I wasn&#39;t expecting Mediterranean food when we walked into Pitaville, and not that I am not interested in trying different foods, but the mood we were in really just called for something expected and comfortable. The menu had plenty of things I was interested in trying, but not today. I had no patience for experimenting with something new and ending up not liking what I bought.

Kim and I both went for the Chicken Kabob on a pita, and we got Elise fries because she won&#39;t eat anything that has any nutritional value. When we finally unwrapped it all at home, we found little containers of sauces, which turned out to both be delicious. The hot sauce is well beyond my Scoville tolerance, but I couldn&#39;t stop putting it on the pita. 

We both really loved everything we had--to the point that Kim let me know that if I wasn&#39;t going to finish mine, that she would take one for the team and finish it for me. Not a chance.

It was a very pleasant surprise to stumble onto this great little restaurant and both of us cant wait to go back to try more of the menu. I guarantee you that we will both be more experimental in our orders next time and venture into many new flavors. I want to sample more of the samplers and Kim was definitely interested in the salads. 

Looking forward to the next opportunity to go back again."

Sorry, Pitaville, but Naf Naf wins. Why? 

The breakdown: 
My boyfriend and I went for dinner on a week-night. The place was pretty dark inside (minimal decor aside from a tv) with a few diners. Service was friendly and helpful. 

He got the lamb kebab entree, I got the dinner meat combo (beef kafta kebab, chicken kafta kebab, beef shwarma and falafel. Also came with a small piece of grilled chicken, all over saffron rice.) 

The biggest sin was that everything was so DRY. The meat, the pitas (which tasted right out of a store bag), the falafel. My dinner combo would have been a nice sampling of their offerings but everything lacked moisture. The worst was the beef shwarma, small shavings of beef that were so dried out as to be totally unappetizing. The best was the grilled chicken, which had been marinated in some spices so as to become yellow, but even this was thin and fairly arid. Adding the hot sauce and tzaziki-like sauce from squeeze bottles helped to hide this somewhat, but not enough. 
The rice was the best offering. 

My boyfriend thought the same of his lamb kebab dish: too dry. 

Having used our coupon, we are now armed with knowledge of one more Naperville restaurant. I won&#39;t waste away another meal again in Pitaville."

Nobody can beat Naf Naf&#39;s pita, they have a solid winner there.  But Pitaville was really a great option as well.  Pitaville has a lot of great choices and I could see myself coming back to try some of the other things.  Because I already had this preconceived notion that I would probably be disappointed with the pita I ordered a Beef Shawarma entree.  This consisted of hummus, rice, salad, and a pita bread.  The shawarma was amazingly good.  When I mixed it all together on the plate it was like magic in my mouth and I hardly noticed that the pita was just your average pita.  I would totally come back here and try some of the other great things on the menu.

When I walked in and read the menu board I knew I wanted falafel but wasn&#39;t sure if I wanted the Pita or Entree. I asked who I assume was the owner and he very nicely explained the difference to me. I was sold on the entree (it comes with a nice warm pita also).

So for 10.99 with my soft drink I got a fantastic dinner. The falafel was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside, the pita was soft and warm, the hummus was the best &#34;plain&#34; hummus I&#39;ve had in a while with the exception of my homemade hummus, the tahini sauce was great and the little salad it came with was a nice touch and very fresh. The only thing I wasn&#39;t crazy about was the rice, but honestly I had more than enough food to even care about the rice. Plus, I think most mediterranean style rices are kind of bland. 

Anyway, the portion size was huge, the price was right, the food was great and the staff was super friendly.

The portions were hearty ( 6 pieces of falafel, rice, and fatoush salad with pita), and the wife&#39;s was the same except it had a generous amount of shawarma instead of the falafel. Both were average to above average.
 I visited Naf naf last week and thought the one thing missing was the fresh-baked pita that Naf naf serves. Pitaville obviously uses supermarket variety pre-packaged pita. Other than that, it was good, service was friendly, and the shawarma tasted better than Naf naf&#39;s. It was also a bundle cheaper. With my 50% off the second entree coupon(from the Clipper magazine), my total was $17 with a baklava dessert. At Naf Naf, it was over $30, so if you can deal without the fresh pita, this place is worth the trip."

Hummus, Tabouleh, Falafel, and almost every other kind of Arabic food, drink, and ingredient native to Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, Egypt, Iraq, and the rest of the Arab world suddenly becomes &#34;Israeli&#34; without any acknowledgement of its true origins.

How exactly is falafel, which existed long before &#34;Israel&#34; a &#34;signifier of Israeli pride&#34; unless one is proud of cultural theft?

In a refreshing moment of honesty, Gil Hovav admits:  &#34;Of course Hummus is Arabic.  Falafel, our national dish, our national Israeli dish, is completely Arabic and this salad that we call an Israeli Salad, actually it&#39;s an Arab salad, Palestinian salad.

Anyhow--about the meal--
I&#34;ll confess that this is only my second time eating Mediterranean food. I ordered the two meat package with chicken and steak shawarma. The chicken was tasty and well seasoned but a bit on the dry side. The beef was tenderloin and well seasoned and cooked to perfection!  Large tender cuts and deliciously moist and flavorful. Mmmmm. The sides and condiments rice, chopped salad in a light vinegar tasting dressing, freshly baked pita and s&#39;khug sauce (spicy but so tasty) totally sent me over the top. I loved this food."

Ahh well sometimes you need to discover the truth the hard way. Ive been  spoiled 
by really really good Mediterranean food and came here and sadly, bland is the best word to describe this place. From its fast food appearance to the employees attitude to the layout and including the food. Greatly disappointed but cant say I wasn&#39;t warned. Oh the place is clean, employees are nice but not overly so, there is nothing special about this place that would make me return. Its also priced too high. I can pay far less, nearby, and get way more food and have it knock my socks off with flavors! I ordered the chicken shawarma. Pita was not fresh, ingredients had no flavor, spice or crunch. Not saying it was old or bad, but it was boring with no taste.  The whole place reminds me of when you go to eat somewhere interesting with your spouse but have to stop here first to get carryout for the kids. (Ya know, a place that is very basic, bland but kids are demanding it cause they wont take a chance, taste wise somewhere interesting!) This place needs to shorten the menu, add some spices, and get some customer service instead of acting like a chain and going thru the motions."

4-stars because is it quick and easy.
3-stars because it tastes like fast food.

Went in the other night to grab dinner to go. Not a good first impression--the young lady behind the counter seems to have a real attitude. She didn&#39;t acknowledge us, didn&#39;t greet us, didn&#39;t make eye contact, she just looked down and away as though this type of work was beneath here and we were somehow bothering her. We were there once previously, and the man that took our order was much friendlier.

We ordered a Falafel Pita sandwich and Chicken Swarma plate to go. I would say the food was ready in about 10 to 12 minutes, which was acceptable as there was one customer ahead of us. When the cook guy handed me the bag of food, it didn&#39;t look like everything was there. I ask him to double check, which he did nicely, verbally calling off each item in the bag and which meal it was for.

There is some assembly required because they package everything separately--chicken in its own container, rice in its own container, falafel in its own container, etc. Other places put the entire dinner on one plate with a lid.

Naf Naf is good if you are looking for a quick bit to eat (since it is fast food style), but there really isn&#39;t a depth of flavor."

The menu is small, but not a problem if you order the Chicken Shwarma. It is so flavorful and juicy with little crispy edges, yum!  The fresh made pita bread is airy and fluffy, very good.  I had the Shwarma sandwich and this may be a strange compliment, but they cut and stuffed it perfectly so that I could eat it mess free! They serve it with this green sauce that is super spicy, which I enjoy, but be cautious how much you use.  The portion sizes are large so certainly worth the price.

My husband had these falafel things. A bit spicy for me (I don&#39;t like anything spicy though) and we shared the shawarma with delicious pitas; fresh warm and everything made to order. This place was laid out very nicely and the workers were super friendly and patient. She explained very thing to me and let me try a few items.

I also like the baba ganoush here, purple cabbage salad and the fries. It&#39;s all so fresh and extremely high quality ingredients.  
I good suggestion is to buy some extra pitas to take home with a side of hummus or Israeli salad or just plain, they are that good. The pita is unmatched at any other middle eastern or Greek restaurant; I have never had better. I also like the pickles they have put to grab. They are different, and worth a try.

I ordered the shwarma pita combo and added two falafel balls. Everything was so fresh and tasted fantastic! Even the hummus and tahini sauces in the pita were just right. The green spicy chimichurri stuff was great too. What looked like house made chips were not. They were &#34;hello, nice to meet you&#34; flat fries in my opinion.  I&#39;m seriously impressed.

Love this place!

I&#39;m not a complete middle eastern NOOB... but it&#39;s close. I know what Falafel is and I like it. When I was in Greece, I saw the Shawarma being made and always thought that it might just be a different kind of gyros.

Naf Naf takes the guess work out of the process. Our first time there, I had the Chicken Shawarma and I didn&#39;t mess around with it (I have a tendency to do that) I got it the way it reads on the menu... full of Israeli salad and tahini.... YUM.

The second time I tried the Beef Tenderloin, once again the way it&#39;s described.. delicious!

I really like the hot sauce.. particularly on their very wonderful Falafel. I find it to be mildly spicy and packed with flavor.

The Nan (Pita) is soft and wonderful. The fries are made like potatoes chips, but not crispy, they are quite good.

Naf Naf has a good website where the nutritional info is available.

As a relative NOOB, one of the things I love about the place is the cleanliness and their efficiency. The restaurant inspires confidence, I hope that they are able to keep it up.

Good, good, job, job.. Naf Naf"

All their foods are good, but here&#39;s what I recommend:
No matter what, you have to try their fries....they are not French fries.  They are thinly sliced potatoes and are so good.

The chicken schwarma pita is really good.  They have falafel which is good, but you can order a veggie plate, which includes falafel and bread and several things to dip in, like hummus and baba ganousch

Anyway it&#39;s tasty and the pitas are always perfectly fresh. Actually, everything I&#39;ve ever had there seems really fresh!

 If you are a heat-wimp like me, be careful with the green sauce (s&#39;khug) that they give on the side, it is HOT. We usually get take-out, so I mix it with a little mayo and then drizzle it on to tone it down a bit."

Like, none. Pretty sure they&#39;re operating at a 100% success rate in the keeping-everyone-alive-while-on-or-near-the-premises department. 

I mean, I have no way of knowing for sure (about the Kool Aid drink-age thing). None of us do. But I can, will, and and am very prepared to speculate on it all.

Anyway, the base point I&#39;m trying to make here is that it really only takes one poke of a pita to become a devout follower of all things Naf Naf. 

I&#39;ve been frequenting the original Naf Naf since it&#39;s first (and far less chic) days back on Ogden avenue in the old Taco Bell space (now located in the far fancier Freedom Drive digs), but this was my first ever time at *this* particular Naf Naf. 

VERDICT: Above and beyond. Like, I think this location might even top the first one. 

Enthusiastic. Complimentary. Spirited... 
      ^                         ^                   ^
the staff are all of the above and then some. 

I&#39;d originally only popped in to grab a pack of pitas to-go, but thennnn... you know how it goes. I started to look at the menu (which is exactly the same as the other location - a good thing) and then one thing led to another and all of a sudden I&#39;m standing at the end of the line with red-blinking pager thing waiting for dinner for 4 with apps, sides, and dessert to come up. I couldn&#39;t help it. 

All our food was perfect and came up lickety-split + when I was ordering, the cashier girl complimented my hair and I know that could just be a thing they do, but I&#39;m telling you, it felt really genuine. THEN, while I was waiting for my food (and feeling super good about myself because of the aforementioned compliment) when the guy manning the pick-up area asked me how my day was going. So nice and again, felt really genuine.

This is a large place--lots of seating with a few tables big enough for groups of six.  On the Saturday evening I went, there was a steady flow of customers and lots of employees behind the counter to keep things running smoothly.  My chicken schnitzel and drink wasn&#39;t cheap--add tax, and it was $15.50.  With plates, you&#39;re allowed a couple sides.  My basmati rice and fries were good, and the pita--the most noticeable different between Naf Naf Grill and an average falafel place is the pita bread.

The food has been consistent throughout all of our visits except for the chips.  The chips are either super oily or overly dry and burnt.  There is usually a wait for our food as it&#39;s made to order, so it&#39;s not a fast as your typical fast food establishment. 

Tip: don&#39;t sit by the booths along the windows.  We saw a pretty healthy looking rat come out to grab food on the floor several times.  The people behind the counter were made aware of this - and reassured customers that they would take care of it.

Food is typically very fresh; I personally love their veggie platter and their falafel/pita options. Their pita bread is beautifully soft and delicious. Their vegetarian options are generally quite good. My service here has always been average, though, which is the only thing that takes away from it. Besides that, this is a great little spot to get a meal or grab takeout."

Instead of being directly  handed to the manager I was put on hold and had to talk to Catherine.

We came to this area as my wife wanted to shop one last time at Achievers before it closed for good.  While she was going about her business, I started planning for lunch and noticed this place on my book marks and saw that a few trusty Yelp friends recently came here, so figured it was a safe bet for a good lunch.  

Once again, Yelp provides us with a great eating experience. 

I&#39;m a fan of the kabob / pitta scene and know my way around the menu of such places.  I frequent Pitta In, as there is one close by my work, which is &#34;always&#34; packed.   My problem, is one pitta is &#34;never&#34; enough for me, and depending on the place, the platter can be a bit large for lunch.   So, being this was my first time at Naf Naf, I was pondering on what to get.   When I looked about the sizable dinning area, I noticed everyone had some sort of Pita, and there were no platters.   So, what to do... Pita or Platter it?   I consulted with my wife to see how hungry she was, which came back with a, &#34;I&#39;m starved.&#34;   Great!   I am too.  And, considering time time of day 2:00 pm, this lunch would good up dinner time, so, figured, we&#39;ll go for it and make this our large meal of the day. 

So, ordered two types of pitta (chicken &amp; beef) and a mixed kabob platter.   Needless to say this was a lot of food, but it gave us the chance to try out a few things and enjoy the various textures, aromas, and sauces.   ALL of which passed our palates with ease and tickled our taste buds!    I liked the hot sauce, it was a great add.  I was however disappointed with the rice and the soda coming out of the self served fountain was flat.

The atmosphere was okay, high cleaning, open space, plenty of seating.  The restrooms were clean.    The service was okay, you just interact at the counter.  

Overall we were happy with the meal.  As others said, the chicken shwarma pita was probably the best part, but the kabob platter was a very close second.   I certainly would not go out of my way to come here, as I think the Pita Inn close to my home is better than Naf Naf... but would certainly come back here when I&#39;m in the area."

We are one of the first customers of naf naf having eaten at their &#34; old Taco Bell&#34; first location from the start.

Even though my options as a gluten-free eater are limited there I have always enjoyed their food. My favorite is the plate with the chicken thighs.
The meat is so flavorful and juicy and their basmati rice and israeli salad make it a well balanced meal. 
Especially the israeli salad is very good. I think it is just cuccumbers and tomatoes, but man, they must do something great with it, because it is so yummy.

The only thing I wish is, that the price for the plates weren¬¥t so high. It is more a dinner price than a lunch price.

I recently decided to basically take a pita without the pita, just to have the same things as on the plate dish mentioned above, but for a lower price. Then I ordered the rice as a side and everthing was great."

The chicken shawarma is life-changing, mind-blowing, a new standard. If you&#39;re a white meat fanatic, drop all your notions of dark meat chicken because it has so much more flavor than its leaner counterpart. And, Naf Naf&#39;s isn&#39;t fatty... not at all.

It seems a lot of people are afraid to try Mediterranean food, but the basics are similar from Greece to Lebanon.

I have tried the chicken shwarma (just OK.) and beef kefta (very greasy and not a good fit with the other flavors on the plates or in the pitas as well as the sides).   Those were the items I didn&#39;t enjoy that much, but other items I&#39;ve enjoyed greatly.

The chicken breast kabob pita is very good for a not that heavy lunch.  The hummus and Israeli salad inside go well with the chicken and the pita itself is bordering on addictive.  If you get a plate, you still get a pita, but also 2 of Israeli Salad, Fries (really tasty and not that greasy fresh cut ones) or a Basmati Rice, that is decent.  

The schnitzel is also good-breaded, but not too heavily coated-and while I have yet to try the beef tenderloin, I plan on doing so as it has looked tasty on plates of fellow diners.  Not that I stare at others plates, that would be rude!

I tend to give a lot of 4 star ratings, maybe because I&#39;m just such an optimist, but this is a good occasional lunch place that makes a few things well.   And they have baklava for dessert!"

I highly recommend getting the homemade fries and the salad as sides. I made the mistake of getting the Basmati rice, which is bland and pointless to order.

To some, naf naf can be considered the chipotle of middle eastern cuisine, to others it&#39;s an Arab Taco Bell. Their pita is fluffy and soft due to the shocking amount of yeast put in. I liked the quick layout of the place and scenery, it&#39;s big and looks comfy. I like the little chutney cups they have to go with your food. I&#39;ve had the chicken shawarma and it was tasty (I could imagine how much salt was used since my tongue was dry and I was left dehydrated after eating my sandwich) I love the salad. Fresh lettuce nice and light but filling. Even though the meat is tasty it leaves a salty aftertaste which questions what they are using to season (rock salt, or something else?). The falafel sandwich was amazing. I would come back here for falafel sandwich and the convenience of quick fast food ordering...but I would still want to drive down 5 minutes to pitaville instead.

Next time we go I&#39;d like to try the Lentil Soup.  I&#39;m picky about my soups, but I&#39;m really interested to taste theirs since we&#39;ve liked everything so far!  I&#39;ll also go for the Beef Tenderloin Kabab to change it up so I don&#39;t just keep ordering the same things!  You can also buy and take home their pitas!"

It&#39;s very filling and I always have a ton of food left for the next day lunch. I almost always do schnitzel and shawarma on a plate. The only thing I&#39;ve ever had a problem with is when I order carry out. The lady on the phone is always rude and impatient. So there&#39;s that. But other than that their pita is the best I&#39;ve ever had. Seriously so warm and soft and just amazing. I fall in love again and again.

The schwarma itself is tiny bits, very mild flavoring, and well....meh. You can get better tasting schwarma elsewhere in Naperville. 

The Israeli salad was pretty good, small cucumber pieces, fresh dressing. The rice they give you, yellow, was not pungent with flavor, either. 

I noticed though, that the portions are slightly small. Though maybe this is just takeout? And they seem pretty stingy with the condiments, also. 

If you are really looking for GOOD schwarma, go elsewhere. It wont hit the spot."

I tried the falafel pita with a side of fries.  The pita bread was so soft, I&#39;m ashamed I ever purchased pre-packaged stuff and considered that cardboard to be pita bread.  The falafel balls had a suble flavor and nice crispiness; I also liked the sauce and cucumber.  

This was to-go, and I found 3 little plastic cups in my bag.  Two were an unidentified sauce-like substance, and the other contained some pickle-like peppers.  I threw out the sauce, since I wanted to try my pita without anything else.  I tried the pickle-peppers, wasn&#39;t impressed, and tossed those.  3 containers is confusing and fussy.

The homestyle fries were just okay.  Needed a little more salt.  But the portion was huge, I could&#39;ve easily shared this with another person.

I will definitely return."

Crispy chip like homemade fries lightly salted was a great side to dip into the tahini sauce.

Their pitas are like little homemade pita-pillows. They are delectable as fine chocolate, light as air and fresher than an apple directly off a tree. They melt in your mouth like M&amp;M&#39;s in your hand. Yes, I can go on for days about how amazing their pitas are. And I might get back to them a little further in my review...but I can tell you that you have to try them to know what I&#39;m talking about.

So, my fiance and I were in the area for an appointment and I know how much I love Naperville and how rarely I visit, so we decided to grab a bite and try to keep it on the cheap.  The single $ sign on Yelp and 4 stars led us here.

To begin, they are kinda set up like Chipotle. I have to be honest and say that this may devalue the place a little for me. I get the concept: order at the counter, fill up your drink, find a table, wait to be paged, collect your food. I have no issue with this at all. Just the layout makes this a bit of a &#34;Mediterranean Chipotle&#34; for me. No great thrill about the same old dining scene. When I walked in, that&#39;s exactly what crossed my mind.

My favorite points:
-They offer both Coke Zero and Sprite Zero---total score!! Too bad, I am watching my soda intake and sodium, so I skipped the soda during this visit.
-The food is prepared in front of you. You can stand at the counter and watch your meal prepared.
-FRESHEST pitas known to man! (sold by the bag at the counter- kinda wish I grabbed a bag of them)
-Wait time is minimal.

We both ordered the Chicken Schawarma pitas. No healthier pita option available. But totally worth the calories. I didn&#39;t read the sign well enough to know that hummus is used as a spread on the sandwich. Next time, I will ask for it on the side and you may want to, as well, if you are like me and only like a little hummus. My fiance, however, asked for everything on the side except the salad portion, so his hummus is in a little container in our fridge at home right now. Thank you, hunny, I&#39;ll enjoy that later. I only got the pita sandwich, he added the side and drink for the $2.50. Went for the &#34;fries&#34;. They are more like home fries or chips, even. And delish!! I snuck a few. I just couldn&#39;t help myself. Also, totally worth the calories. And enough for two to share, by the way!! The chicken schawarma is both dark and white meat chicken combined. Didn&#39;t really know that originally, but surprisingly, it wasn&#39;t fatty at all. 

The place was clean, bathrooms included. The tables were cleaned off and the soda station/utensil area was not a mess. They obviously take pride in their restaurant and I was pleased to see the employee cleaning on the floor almost the entire time we were there. Garbage was emptied and there wasn&#39;t a pile of baskets at the garbage area. They were on top of it. Impressive. It wasn&#39;t the busiest place in the world, but it seemed a lot of people order to go and take it home. I would do the same but we live too far to take home. 

Things to work on:
-The young lady who took our order told us that lettuce, onion and tomatoes made up the Israeli salad that tops the Chicken Shawarma pita sandwiches. When we got our food, it was cucumber, tomato and onion. Not a problem for me who LOVES cucumbers, but my fiance doesn&#39;t really care for them. No lettuce to be found. Confusing??
-I emailed their address found on their webpage to request nutritional info (Email: info@nafnafgrill.com) and received an auto response that the email failed to go through. I was quite disappointed to find that their email doesn&#39;t work and more so, that I have no way to request or find out this information. Yes, I did request it at the counter before we even placed our order.

We&#39;ll be back...next time, my sister will have to join me. It&#39;s pretty awesome and the fact that you can keep your caloric intake to a minimum is an advantage (even if I don&#39;t know the exact calorie count, it&#39;s not Portillo&#39;s Beef calories).

Slowly Becoming a Fan of Fast Casual Dining."

The food is good, quality, fast, and authentic enough.  The fresh, warm pitas are awesome.  I&#39;ll give Naf Naf that.  Oh, and they hook it up with the huge, filling portion sizes.  The restaurant is clean, and the service is fine as well.  But that&#39;s where my praise for Naf Naf comes to its untimely demise, and the nitpicking Yelphole in me must emerge.

Like I said, the portion sizes are large.  But it&#39;s mostly due to all the starches they lay on you--pitas, fries, and rice.  I kind of feel like for the price you pay, they really skimp you on the protein.  Speaking of price, that&#39;s my biggest gripe with Naf Naf.

I ordered the chicken kebob plate with a cup of water, and my bill came out to $13.19.  The fare offered at Naf Naf is, essentially, street food.  Naf Naf borders on being categorized as fast food Mediterranean--in fact, my meal was served on a tray along with plastic ware.  That being said, I just can&#39;t justify the price point.

I am by no means a cheap bastard, but I&#39;ve been to plenty of non-chain, family-owned Mediterranean restaurants and paid about the same as what Naf Naf charges.  But it&#39;s more understandable to pay those prices at the other restaurants where you are being serviced by wait staff and eat your kebob on actual ceramic dishes with actual silverware.  Some even provide belly dancers to entertain the diners.

Naf Naf offers great food.  Just not for the price.  The only way I can see them justifying the prices is if they start having belly dancers serve you your shawarmas at your tables.  And when that happens, I&#39;ll definitely be back."

I love the food and it is pretty consistently good.  But I do have one gripe.  I know that restaurants have to make a profit, but I kind of wanted to save a couple of bucks the last time I came here, so I thought I would just get a drink instead of getting the combo since I wasn&#39;t that hungry.  The joke was on me because after I paid, I realized that I had only saved myself 19 Cents by not getting the combo.  That&#39;s right....they charge $2.10 for a fountain drink.  I can see why everyone asks for glasses of water instead of paying for a fountain drink and I know that there are other options rather than ordering a drink, but it is a shame that you have to go without a drink because of an insane price tag."

Naf Naf left us satisfied and definitely very full!  Don&#39;t even try to find pita bread as soft as Naf Naf&#39;s anywhere else because you won&#39;t find any!

I had the Chicken Shawarma Sandwich while the girlfriend had the Falafel Sandwich.  My girlfriend&#39;s sandwich was nicely packed with falafels.  She thought she&#39;d eaten all the falafels in her sandwich but was surprised to find about three or four more left as she was finishing her sandwich off.  There was a lot going on in my sandwich also, but there could have been just a little more chicken.  The Israeli salad in the sandwich was refreshing, but it overpowered my sandwich.  

We ordered the combos for each, which got us a side and a drink.  I got the Basmati RIce, which was pretty underwhelming, but my girlfriend&#39;s fries were nice and crispy.  We decided to get a Bakalava as well, but it really fell flat -- simply too dense and buttery. 

The restaurant is spacious and clean, and it had a &#34;Chipotle for kabobs&#34; feel inside. I still think Just Kabobs is better, but Naf Naf is worth a visit.  We&#39;ll definitely come back in the future."

Placement of tables makes it difficult for wheelchairs. Because it is basically all tables, wheelchairs can fit. It is proximity of tables that prohibited mobility. The simple menu is hard to order off of. The combos are.. Well nothing wrong but just not what I prefer. Customer service was great. We told the person it was first time and he walked us through our order because.... Well... I wanted everything.  We ended up with 2 mix combos to sample as much as we could. I have to say.. 2 combos and 2 drinks of pop with one extra pita.. $37. + change... For lunch. We were full but that&#39;s still $$$. For a fast food place. Soo the important part... The food;  Pitas,baba,hummus, falafel, chicken and soup. Let me start by saying the pita is baked constantly right there.. It is EPIC! So so delish. The Baba is flavorful but strange and hummus was bland. Both covered with paprika and they make a hole in each and fill with oil. Ewww~wah ! it totally ruined it for me. The lental soup was good. Thick with cilantro.  A herb fav! The chicken was good. Turmeric.. The falafel was good but a bit over fried. The Israel salad is a fav of mine with falafel. This was good as well.  Nothing tasted overly seasoned.,. Could boarder almost bland. They advertise a tystiki  sauce but it is a sesame tahini with nooo flavor. Chicken can be hit or miss.. Today was hit. We ordered the Baklava to go. Had later... It was soooo good. Tiny but really good. I love love love that there are no garbages on the eating floor. The design is such that the cleaning.. garbage, trays etc are separated from your eating space. Really nice concept. You bus your table but they also have a person during hi traffic to help and keep tables clean. By the time we left it was packed. I won&#39;t be making this a regular haunt... But I will stop in for a bag of pitas.

 Note: although nothing tasted salty.. Within 30 min of meal I was ill. Crushing headache... Dizzy.... Just not OK. This only happens when a huge amount of sodium is introduced to my body. Ten min after me my date had a headache. I am sensitive to sodium... He is not. We were dehydrated to the point of lips stuck to teeth. Mmmm water!!! After 2 hours and 2 bottles of water each. We felt better."

The place looks and feels kind of like Chipotle but the food is made fresh to order here, which is a nice point of difference.

That said, I got the falafel pita ($4.99) and had some issues with it:

1) There&#39;s no wholewheat pita option and the pita they give you is disgustingly soft, like Wonder Bread. It&#39;s both unhealthy and not particularly tasty, either.

2). They don&#39;t put enough cucumbers and tomatoes in the pita.

3) The &#34;fries&#34; that come with the dish were soggy. They were meant to be like chips, but they clearly didn&#39;t fry them long enough so they came out limp. This is a serious quality control issue.

All that said, the falafel pieces themselves taste pretty good and were properly spiced.

If Naf Naf had wholewheat pita and put a little more care into the preparation of their food, I&#39;d give them another star. On a whole, this place offers a nice change of pace from your average stripmall suburban food."

I recommend ordering about 10 minutes before pickup using the mobile app to see all the deals and track your order status. They also started giving out points towards free pizza on the mobile app: even better. 

There&#39;s a small amount of indoor seating if you prefer but this is primarily a carry-out or delivery oriented business. One warning is that this location is lightly staffed and occasionally the Dominos supply truck will show up right before lunch rush and mess up everything as the only cook has to help unload I assume. This has only happened to me once however and the app kept me up to minute on my pizza, although it took about twenty five minutes to be ready, an eternity in fast food pizza."

Pizza&#39;s were hot, crispy, and actually very good.  M-W you can get a large pizza with 2 toppings for 7.99 - that&#39;s a great deal.  (Carry-out only).

** When I went to pick up the pizzas, I made small talk with one of the employees who was beyond nice.  He told me as long as he is working - no matter what the day - weekends, Friday, whatever - if I come in there - &#34;He&#39;ll still give me the 7.99 large pizza deal.&#34;

Can&#39;t beat that kinda customer service and appreciation...."

I ordered online just before 8pm, the online tracker showed it was ready and since I live only 5 min away, I was at the location ready to pick up my order immediately. the guy at the cash told me that dominoes closed at 8pm, what the heck was I doing there, why didn&#39;t I call etc etc. I&#39;m like what the heck, I ordered online where it said clearly they were open till midnight, and why would I call to confirm an online order? that&#39;s not how it works. he goes to check the &#39;pizza&#39; area and there was an order waiting for me, and he keeps saying 8.57 several times while doing other things, which I didn&#39;t understand, I pulled up my online order confirmation on my phone and realized it was the amount I needed to pay. He then took 2 customers before me because I wanted to use my debit card - I have no idea why. they used their cards, why couldn&#39;t I use mine. So finally I got ready to pay and he said 9.19 ... WTF. I was like you just said 8.57, my order said 8.57 why would I pay your random amount. he made some stupid excuses, life was super awkward for a few minutes, and I got my pizza and got out of there. Turned out my pizza was missing pepperoni. DON&#39;T ORDER FROM THESE PPL. I will be checking my debit card&#39;s account daily to make sure random purchases aren&#39;t showing up."

We were looking for a place with high quality seafood. We could not get a table, so we decided to eat at the bar. Hugo&#39;s has a great atmosphere, very classy. 

We shared the seafood plate appetizer and were not disappointed. While it was expensive, the quality of the crab legs, avocado crab and oysters was fresh and excellent.  The shrimp were large and tasty.

I also ordered the clam chowder which was very creamy and with a nice smoked bacon flavor. My wife had the wedge salad which was fresh.

While pricey, Hugo&#39;s delivers on atmosphere, service, and quality of the food. 

We will try Hugo&#39;s again for a full dinner in the future."

Our plans were the Naperville Wine Fest but it was so crowded, we did not want to stand in line over an hour just to get in. We found Hugo&#39;s. We did have a long wait for our table but the food was phenomenal. The staff, outstanding. We were in a large group of 14, most of whom had been drinking and golfing all day, so a couple in our group were a bit &#34;rambunctious&#34;, if you will. 

Our waiter, Brian Forner was fantastic. And patient. We didn&#39;t have to wait long for another drink. He was attentive and personable. Not to mention handsome! 
The sea bass. King Crab stuffed shrimp. Grilled salmon. Calamari. Lobster roll. Firecracker shrimp. Crab cakes. Even the steaks were delicious. (Yes. We all tried on another&#39;s dishes) I highly recommend Hugo&#39;s but try to get reservations!"

My friend and I LOVED everything we had, and I can&#39;t imagine how this place gets lukewarm reviews.  I felt compelled to review it!

Our waiter was Michael, who was busy, but he had support filling our glasses and making sure we had everything we needed.  We were well cared for throughout.  

Appetizer - Baked goat cheese- AMAZING!  Served with crostini, absolutely delicious...wanted to lick the plate it was that good

Entree - The lamb chops were tender and tasty.  The blue cheese mashed potatoes that came with were creamy and had the perfect amount of cheese.  We had the brussel sprouts for the table, which were perfectly nutty and covered in Parmesan.  My friend had the tuna steak and enjoyed it.

Dessert - The muddy bottom pie - AMAZING, easily enough to satisfy four people.  Adult ice cream cake as we called it.  It&#39;s fudge on the plate, a chocolate crust, chocolate and then vanilla ice cream and topped with macadamia nuts, chocolate chips,and marshmallows and drizzled with caramel.

We were so stuffed it was ridiculous, but neither of us would have cut anything from our order.

Now, dinner wasn&#39;t cheap, around $120 for all of that with a drink each, but worth every penny.  I don&#39;t mind spending a little money when the food is this good!"

The restaurant has plenty of seating and a nice bar area. It is very noisy space and the tables are right on top of each other. I got bumped twice by the people next to me. Service here is good and attentive. They have a lunch menu featuring soups, sliders and salads for $2-3 each. Today, I had the tilapia fish tacos. Unfortunately, they were tasteless, which surprised me as they looked delicious. The tilapia was grilled but so bland. The slice of avocado added creaminess but the very little salsa didn&#39;t do much, but the very small portion of sauce added flavor. There wasn&#39;t enough of the sauce for all three tacos as I was layering it on to add flavor. The dish lacked the very basic, salt.  When cooking salt should be added to add flavor for sure. My friend had the salmon BLT and I was jealous. It looked amazing and she said is was very good.  I would come back again just to have that."

Prime rib sliders with potato chips is $5, cup of clam chowder is $2 and a (big) house salad is just $2. It is much cheaper than going for dinner, which is why we went here for lunch. We sat outside and it was very calming with a fountain out back as well. The past time I visited here the service was very slow especially considering how few people were at the restaurant."

I was hungry and we were desperately searching for food on a Thursday evening. Luckily, Hugo&#39;s frog bar was open till late night, so that was an easy choice for us. When we walked into the restaurant, there were a few patrons at the bar area and some leftover in the dining room, but for the most part, the crowd was gone. We were given a choice by the host to sit in either the bar area or the dining room, and we picked the dining room, which seemed more quiet and intimate than the bar. 

We chose to sit at a cozy booth and the dim lighting and nice d√©cor made this place easily enjoyable. We were greeted immediately. I ordered a sunrise martini, which was strong and excellent. For our starter, we decided to share the jumbo lump crab cake--this was delicious! A huge crab cake, this was packed with crab meat and had a surprising relish throughout, which added both flavor and crunch. The hot pink mayonnaise was attractive and delicious, and was a great compliment to the crab cake.

I almost decided against a main, but once our server brought out the cuts of meat and fish and described how everything is delivered daily, cooked fresh, and never frozen, I just couldn&#39;t resist. Every meat on his tray looked absolutely delectable, so I had to treat myself to one. I decided on the halibut with lobster risotto. WOW, was this an incredibly delicious dish! The fish was soft, tender, perfectly seasoned, and melt-in-your-mouth. The lobster risotto was just as well seasoned and wonderfully cooked with the right texture and consistency. The pieces of plump lobster really elevated the dish, and I loved every bite of it. As if that weren&#39;t enough, we ordered a side as well: the king crab mac and cheese with andouille sausage. The mac and cheese is very rich and filling, but also tasted very delicious.

Overall, this was a surprisingly delicious and satisfying meal. At 10pm on a Thursday night when every other restaurant is closed, it highly exceeded my expectations and as such, I enjoyed phenomenal food. Excellent food, fantastic service--can&#39;t wait to come back!"

Usually when my husband and I go, we simply order the Crabmeat and Avocado, the Baked Goat Cheese, several Filet Mingon Sliders, and maybe a Key Lime Pie Martini or 3.  

The last time I went, I tried the Maine Lobster Roll. I&#39;ve never tried one, but now I question all my life choices, because it was so good that I have no idea why I waited so long to try one.  Phenomenal.

As far as the service, the valet service is quick, the hostesses are friendly, the bartenders know what they&#39;re doing, the servers are a riot, and the manager always stops by to say hello.  Top notch all the way."

Over cooked, and just &#34;off&#34; . the plating was so clumsy, the peas with dried edges were not appealing. The drinks were fine, the others at the table were fine with their choices.

Having lived in Naperville i would walk past this on a regular basis and even see Hugos Frog Bar set up at Ribfest and Spring Fling, they would set up a tent there. 

I was with my mom walking around and she really wanted a soup. I had been craving clam chowder for awhile and saw clam chowder on their menu so we walked in.

The decor inside is terribly cute, i love the east coast feel in this restaurant. I loved the pictures of the boats, the oars, and the rich wood walls . I would live here if i could.

Now on to the food. I ordered an appetizer, crab and avocado and shared it with my mom. It was a perfect size appetizer not too much and not too little. The sauce that was mixed in was sooo good, i cant quite put my finger on what was in the sauce. 

I ordered clam chowder and she got the soup of the day, chicken noodle. This was hands down the best chowder ive ever had, and that says a lot ive had many chowders while in the east coast. My mom loved her soup too, it had lots of veggies and chicken with flavorful broth. We washed down our soups with mojitos, they were made very well.

For desert we had a carrot cake cupcake. Yummm!!!! The frosting was he right amount of sweet and the cupcake was so moist i almost wish i had a second one.

The service here was amazing probably the best ive ever experienced in dt Naperville. We were very well taken care of. Our server was extremely attentive as well as the rest of the servers and staff. Everytime an employee would walk by they would ask us how we were doing, and if we needed anything. They all seemed happy to be there, made us enjoy our time there and made a wonderful first impression.  Hugos you just got yourself a new customer thank you for a great dining experience."

We came across Hugo&#39;s and went in to ask how long the wait was for a table.  I was told 90 minutes, but outside is first come first serve.  We decide that we would go to the outside dinning area and see about a table.  We did get a table outside.  
 
Our waitress came by and she was very friendly.   We all ordered water to drink(none of us drink soda).  My wife then looked at the drink menu.  She did order a $14 drink.  Then we ordered an appetizer and our meals.  

Once the appetizer came we were all very hungry.  The appetizer was just okay.  They fell flat on that one.

Then our meals came. I ordered chicken and it was dry and hard to eat.  It came on a bed of rice that was also dry and hard to choke down.  My wife ordered a second drink when our food arrived and didn&#39;t get it until 10 minutes after we finished our dinners.

After reading other reviews I was more disappointed now with this place then I was after my dinner. 

We never got any bread
We never saw the fresh fish or steak.
We did not get warm towels at the end
They do not have a kids menu

To sum things up we over paid for an average meal that we could have gotten anywhere."

So yeah... you can say me and Hugo&#39;s go way back. Unfortunately, as a young teenager I didn&#39;t appreciate great food nearly as much as I do now.

Which is why I was super happy to pay Hugo&#39;s another visit with my family recently to celebrate my mother-in-law&#39;s retirement. We had a reservation for 12 people for dinner on a Saturday night and it was packed! So much so that we even had to wait for our table despite calling ahead. It&#39;s unfortunate how cramped the bar area is. With so many people waiting it was quite the cluster. We were able to grab a drink up at the bar, but then had to try and huddle around one small high top table while staying out of the way of guests passing through to the front door.

At least we were seated and I was jazzed to browse the menu. Right off the bat I knew we had to order some crab legs, as well as a cup of New England clam chowder. The saut√©ed crab legs with butter were absolutely phenomenal (if you like crab legs that is), and the clam chowder was great. My husband said the chowder definitely wasn&#39;t the best he&#39;s ever had, but still pretty darn good.

For my main course I went with the crab stuffed shrimp because, well, come on. Mouth watering to say the least. This dish came with 5 large pieces of shrimp stuffed with a good portioned crab cake that alls at in a delicious lemon better sauce. Amazing. I highlight suggest!

Our server was on point. Not only speedy, but funny and personable. Drinks were good, but I didn&#39;t indulge in any of their fancy cocktails. I stuck with a couple old fashioned drinks. They were good, but not the best I&#39;ve had. 

The biggest upset of this dinner was honestly how packed it was. We were so cramped in that it was hard to even get out of my chair without disrupting the table behind me. Because of the large crowd it was also a very loud dinner, not to mention the sports they had on the TV.

Definitely worth a go for their flavorful food. My husband is from the Eastern shore and he claims that the crab cakes at Hugo&#39;s are the best he&#39;s found in Chicagoland (compared to his favorite out in Maryland)."

We were early, which I point out because maybe it played into some of my complaints but definitely doesn&#39;t answer for all of them. 

The appetizer was the fire cracker shrimp, it was very good and the best part of our meal.  This was followed up by a wedge salad which came 15 minutes after our appetizer was done.  Timing is relevant because we didn&#39;t get any refills on drinks (2sodas &amp; a beer) until well after the salad was complete.   My wife and son had empty glasses for well over 15 minutes.   Waiters were all around, along with serving staff yet no one including our waiter bothered to offer a refill. 

After the salad, I noticed we were never brought any bread.   I had to ask for it in order to get it.   I asked after the refills on drinks.   For dinner we all had steaks, mine being their signature WR steak.   My steak was gelatinous.   It wasn&#39;t hot &amp; It just wasn&#39;t good, not much more to say about that.   The Brussell sprouts that we ordered, we had to ask for because they forgot them.  It was great that they showed up when we were 3/4 of the way done with our meal.  

Lastly, and not a big deal, they bring out cuts of steak and fish to the table for people to see before ordering.   For us, they didn&#39;t bother.   This may be a byproduct of us being early, I don&#39;t know.   I do know when your having a bad experience things like this jump out and make it worse.  

In summary:

1-No refills for extended periods
2-No presentation of the steaks as other tables received (again, not the biggest deal)
3-Had to ask for bread over 30 minutes into the dining experience. 
4-Signature steak was not hot
5-Signature steak was gelatinous 
6-Forgot the Brussell sprouts

For $187.00 plus an additional $37.00 Tip, I&#39;ve had better experiences at outback.  I enjoy eating a fine steak and do so pretty regularly, but I won&#39;t be back here to try another."

And the people that come here seem pretty cool with a diverse demographics coming in and out.

Although they have a limited craft beer selection, they have a lot of wine to choose from. 

Clam chowder was piping hot and it definitely hit the spot. For $4 a bowl, now that&#39;s a good deal. Steak frites for $15 sounds like a good deal, but you can pass on this. The frites would get in the way when you slice into the steak and they would fly off everywhere. Although the frites seemed to be a bit burdensome, they remind me of those piknik string fried chips.

And for dessert, I don&#39;t think they have anything less than 600 calories, so I just chose whatever they recommended and went with the pumpkin pie cheesecake because it was October and I felt festive. You can feel the 1000+ calories pulsing through your veins, but hey, it was worth it.

So all in all, a decent experience, and you save a few bucks too. And they have free wi-fi."

Parking is available for free in two lots across from the restaurant. There is also a parking garage on Van Buren Avenue, where the restaurant is actually located. 

The restaurant&#39;s name indicates its main fare: seafood. However, there are plenty of other items on the menu. When I dine at Hugo&#39;s, I usually order Hugo&#39;s turkey club or the herb grilled chicken sandwich. Both are excellent options. The turkey club is sliced into four sections and contains generous slices of avocado and a mildly spicy chipotle mayonnaise. The whole grain bread is lightly toasted. In addition to your sandwich, you receive a side salad with a mix of corn, tomato, and strawberry. As part of the Gibson&#39;s chain of restaurants, you can expect a high quality meal here. 

Hugo&#39;s also has an extensive wine and cocktail menu. My favorite drink to date is the French martini. It is a beautiful pink drink adorned with thick froth on top. The main flavoring is raspberry, but there are hints of other fruits as well.

It has white tablecloths and a classy atmosshere.  The service here is top shelf.  No question that this is a great place for an upscale or special occasion dinner.

The menu has plenty of options for the carnivore and non meat eater alike. The appetizer selections are very nice and upscale. We tried the lump crab cake, yelllowfin tuna tartar, firecracker shrimp and the crabmeat avacado. They were all excelent. I also tried the Bookbinders soup which is a tomato based broth chocked full of seafood. Unique and very good. I also tried the iceburg wedge for a change of pace. This was a good one with plenty of bacon, tomato and blue cheese. The steaks and seafood speak for themselves such as the prime tomahawk, porterhouse and Dover sole. The sides are good as well especially the maple buron brussel sprouts. You cannot go wrong here even for the most discriminating of foodies."

D√©cor: Both inside and out this place gives the feel of how a restaurant should be. There is an awning out front where you&#39;ll be shielded from the elements after you valet, there is in fact a valet, and the d√©cor is not over-the-top but still very nice. The bar area, from what I could see upon entering, is a classic old-school bar that has plenty of options and plenty of seats. It&#39;s open and inviting and yet very relaxed and chill. The dining room is decked out in wood, just like the bar area, and all the staff is dressed to impress in a &#34;southern formal&#34; manner. That&#39;s it, I&#39;ve figured it out, this place has a great &#34;classy southern&#34; feel to it. There are plenty of tables but you do not feel as though you are crammed in like sardines.
Bathroom: The d√©cor matches the rest of the place and it is well looked after.

Staff: The hostess, our waitress, the bus boys, and the &#34;glad-hander&#34; (he wasn&#39;t the manager, I don&#39;t think, but we came around to our table to confirm that everything was enjoyable) were all extremely friendly and more than willing to make our visit enjoyable - and they did!

Food: We didn&#39;t have any drinks (alcoholic drinks) but boy did we EAT. To start, they brought bread, which was pretty standard stuff, and then moved to the apps. We had the Tuna Poke (outstanding! Could have used a few more chips, but SO GOOD) and the Baked? Goat Cheese (very, very good). For dinner we enjoyed a number of items... we had the filet (10oz., perfectly cooked), the Chicago Cut (a good-sized steak but a bit more grisly than I&#39;d think), the Sea Bass (very tasty, but the pee puree masks a bit of the outstanding flavor) and some King Crab Legs (so meaty and so tasty!). We also had a few sides: broccoli (a HUGE portion) and brussel spouts (tasty!). All of the food was prepared perfectly and tasted great. I&#39;d recommend some type of sauce for the steak, if you get one, b/c they don&#39;t have a ton of flavor by themselves. However, they are good quality beef and prepared expertly.

Value: A nice place, that serves steak and seafood, commands a higher price. However, they prices are on-par with other big name steakhouses in the area.

The entire experience, from the staff to the food to the d√©cor, was just a really enjoyable time. I&#39;m a big fan and can&#39;t wait to come back."

The food was very good - I was between 4 and 5 stars and settled on 4 as the entree prices are on the high side in my opinion (soup and salad prices are very reasonable), and the menu variety is only so-so.  Had the stuffed jumbo shrimp which were saltier than I like, but still good.  The beet salad is outstanding and the creme brulee dessert was fantastic.  Good experience all around."

They are absolutely amazing. They are a casual but classy restaurant without the attitude! The employees are friendly, accommodating and provide great service!

The lunch menu is the best, with an array of reasonably priced selections. The dinner menu is exceptional with a beautiful variety of steaks and seafood. The drink specials are always good and the wine selection is great but not overwhelming. I&#39;ve asked for my old fashioneds to be made in a certain way and now only were they patient and accommodating, the drink was amazing!

They are a family friendly restaurant. When my daughter was young and they weren&#39;t busy, the staff interacted with her and her friend. They both have fond memories of dining at Hugo&#39;s. I feel I can take my son there for a mother/son date and that we are going somewhere special. He acts like a little gentleman and the staff treats him as such. 

Hey Hugo&#39;s! What do you think about holding a little Mr. Manners class? ;)

Lastly, Hugo&#39;s is a frequent lunching venue for a group of us ladies. They do not take reservations for the patio in nice weather but when I called to let them know I would be coming in with a large group, they quickly put some tables together by the time we arrived, ten minutes later. I was greatly appreciative.

Hugo&#39;s is a great place for date night, an evening with your children, pre-homecoming/Spring dance dinners, lunch with friends and Christmas Eve dinners."

When we finally sold our house and the money was in the bank, we said let&#39;s go here and order whatever we want! Appetizers, drinks, desserts, the works. We were prepared to take things home to go even. I was contemplating trying every $15 dollar cocktail on the menu. Money was no object today. 

We went on a Saturday afternoon at 2pm with our two year old son. We were happy and excited to be there. 

The waiter came by and immediately asked us for our drink order. My husband ordered a nice beer. I ordered a cocktail. (Both were tasty.) A minute later, the waiter asks for our order. I was still looking at the menu when the waiter literally took the menu out of my hands. I was a little surprised, but ok, I let it go. We ordered our apps and our meal. 

My husband&#39;s app came first. We waited for mine and commented it would&#39;ve been nice to get them at the same time.  Well, when we asked about it, the waiter hadn&#39;t even put in the order. Of course not, he had been in such a rush, he wasn&#39;t listening.  The restaurant was full, but not slammed. And anyway, there&#39;s no excuse for being rushed. 

The meal was the same. I was still working on my app when the main course came and he tried to take my app plate away. I wasn&#39;t done! I kept it, but we thought, what&#39;s the rush? 
Towards the end of our meal, the waiter already brought the hot towels for our hands. We were not done yet. He mumbled, &#34;Room for dessert?&#34; Uh, no thanks. 

I never ordered more than one drink. We didn&#39;t stay for coffee or dessert. We decided to go somewhere else instead for that.

The food was delicious. Everything we ordered was very good. But the service was super rushed. We wanted to enjoy our celebration but we felt rushed the whole time. What a bummer."

Heard nice things about this place from a few friends and came across after I checked out other clothing stores on the same block. The entry was elegant and same size as other stores next to it. The inside was quite big and reminded me of Gibson&#39;s at Oakbrook. I liked Dark wood borders and frames on the wall with white table clothes. The lunch crowd was already there.

I ordered my clam chowder soup and Frog legs as main dish as my friend recommended. The soup was served within 3 minutes. Great texture and flavorful. A little bit heavy and salty. Main course was perfect. The frog was grilled to a nice golden brown and topped with minced garlic and butter(my best guess). The meat was tender and not overloaded with seasoning. Just simple and wonderful. The side were green beans and rice. Green beans were cooked just right which did not like so often i got the overcooked mushy green beans. And green beans was not season but goes perfectly with the garlic and butter source on frog legs. Happy lunch indeed.

My server was great. He was so polite and came only at the right time. Truly enjoyed the whole experience."

hugos-frog-bar-and-fish-house-naperville,Natalie W.,h0ee0u0YDecdwDU4X_a_kw,"Chicago, IL",0,1,0,0,65,aIHy51xxTKyp29EnQp2Iow,2.0,2016-03-03,"Disclaimer:  This review is for a private event at Hugo&#39;s and not the main dining area.

Summary:  Great food, but much improvement is needed in the implementation of private events.
 
Review:  This review is for my baby shower, which my mom threw for me last Sunday in Hugo&#39;s private event room.

PROS:  The food was delicious!  Even something as simple as the house salad received rave reviews from the guests - the lettuce was fresh, bountiful, and dressed with a savory herb vinaigrette which guests continue to talk about.  The main course was equally delectable.  I chose the &#34;Grilled Whitefish,&#34; which was delicate, yet flavorful and perfectly seasoned.  Others at my table commented on how fantastic their dishes tasted; those dishes were the &#34;Marinated Beef Tenderloin Kabob&#34; and &#34;Cajun Chicken &amp; Crab with Andouille Sausage.&#34;  I can&#39;t speak to the desserts (Key Lime Pie and Chocolate Mousse Cake) because I never got to taste them - more on that in the Cons section below.

This event was held in the separate back room across the patio, which is a great space for private events because it has its own separate entrance and guests don&#39;t have to walk through the entire restaurant to get there.  Hugo&#39;s also printed up personalized menus (see pic) which added a nice touch to our shower.

CONS:  The room was set up in a nonsensical manner.  The room was lopsided with all the tables being squished to one side of the room.  One of the dinner tables was literally three feet from the bar.  Can you imagine having 60+ guests crammed into a 3 foot diameter waiting for a drink - it&#39;s not fun.  And it just didn&#39;t make sense seeing as there was ample space on the opposite side of the room to spread every thing out.

As I mentioned, this was for my baby shower which is why my mom requested a long table for gifts.  Again, this simple request was not given any thought; the gift table was put in the corner of the room, directly next to the bar, halfway behind a large palm tree, and only two - I repeat, TWO - feet from the table where guests were eating.  This made absolutely no sense.  There was barely enough room for me and my baby bump to stand much less space to open gifts!  Five of my guests had to move themselves and take their chairs to another table during the gift-opening because I would have been hitting them on the head every time I picked up a gift from the table.  Even after my guests moved, there was still barely room to open and show gifts; we had to waste time clearing our guests&#39; table of all cups and glasses because I was afraid I&#39;d knock over someone&#39;s wine glass - very frustrating.  I don&#39;t know what our event planner was thinking - has she never been to a shower before?! Doesn&#39;t she know you need at least four or five feet in each direction to move around and open gifts?!  I feel like she put absolutely no thought into the setup for our event; it&#39;s like she just did her bare minimum job of getting a head count and having 65 meals prepared.  

I mentioned earlier I would come back to the desserts.  I have a sweet tooth and absolutely love dessert! . . . which is why I was so upset I didn&#39;t get to taste any at my own shower.  The servers purposefully waited to serve the desserts (desserts which were included in the meal package my parents paid for, by the way) until well after our guests had filled up on the beautiful shower cake my mom brought.  Only after the ginormous cake my mom brought was completely eaten, did the servers then bring small plates of Hugo&#39;s dessert for each table to share.  Maybe I&#39;m paranoid, but that seems like a cheap way to skimp out on your obligation to provide dessert. The cake my mom brought was pretty much for tradition/show and for people to take home a piece if they want.  The restaurant desserts should have been served first since they were part of the meal package paid for by my parents.  By the time Hugo&#39;s served the desserts I was already well into opening presents, and by the time I said good-bye to all my guests the desserts were cleared off the table . . . so no dessert for this baby mama : (  

Also, my mom and the ladies at her table had to ask three times for more coffee after dinner and were then told it would take 20 minutes to get more coffee.  Not a huge deal, but still - how hard is it to have coffee ready with dessert?

Bottom line:  Great food.  Private event planners need to pay more attention to detail."

We had a great dining experience! The food was superb, although it was a bit pricey, It was well worth it. They had an extensive wine list . We ended up ordering a bottle of Hess.

The food here is consistently excellent, the service is top-notch, and the bar always makes interesting drinks.

My favorite thing here is the crab cakes.  The entree order would make someone from Baltimore proud- they are huge, delicious, and perfect.  I&#39;ve never had a bad meal here, and I&#39;ve always gone the seafood route.

You&#39;ll need a reservation if you want to eat in the dining room, it&#39;s always booked.  Seating in the bar is first come, first served.  Tables typically turn over in a reasonable amount of time, so you can usually get a table.  Menu is the same in the bar and dining room.

I attempted to take a quick break from the office - my mission was to make a return at a shop in downtown Naperville and then grab lunch.  I ended up having a lot of trouble finding parking, and after waiting in line at the store, I told myself I&#39;d have lunch at the FIRST place I came across.

Standing at the intersection, I saw QBBQ, which looked packed.  And then I saw Hugo&#39;s Frog Bar, which I somehow knew would not be nearly as busy.  I forged ahead and assumed they would have some kind of moderately priced lunch menu.

The &#34;lunch menu&#34; offers salads, sandwiches, and bigger plates like steaks and fish, but there weren&#39;t any nice lunch &#34;deals,&#34; just regular sized portions at regular menu prices.

I took a seat at the bar and perused the menu.  I ordered a Pear Martini ($15), because I cannot resist any drink with St. Germain.  Even if it&#39;s $15, and even if I have to be back at work in less than an hour, I cannot resist!  The drink was strong for a lunch break.  I liked the drink, but not enough to order it again.  Usually drinks with St. Germain are slightly sweet and refreshing, but this drink was more POW! ALCOHOL! than anything else.

For lunch I ordered the Steak Sandwich ($16), cooked medium-well.  The steak was cooked perfectly, and it was served on a French bread roll with garlic butter.  The steak was a whole slab of rib eye, so it was impossible to eat sandwich-style, so I took to my fork &amp; knife.  The bread was nearly impossible to cut through.  The sandwich was served with shoestring fries with a tasty seasoning as well as a pickle spear.

Service at the bar was great.  James was friendly and attentive.  During the lunch hour, Hugo&#39;s wasn&#39;t too busy so there were a lot of servers hanging out at the end of the bar chatting.  I heard one of the waitresses crack a joke using the word &#34;autistic,&#34; so you&#39;re bound to hear a lot of crass shit come out of their mouths if you sit anywhere near the end of the bar like I did.

My meal was delicious, but perhaps not worth the price tag with so many other upscale steakhouses and fish places in the suburbs.  I would come here again if I had a client to entertain and a bottomless expense account."

We were very fortunate to have both Bob and Thomas to address any question needed and provided the guest of honor and all guests with exceptional service. They made everything seemless.

So many delicious items to choose from but funnily enough my favorite is the cajun chicken and crab meal. This establishment never fails to impress.

The room is perfect for events and it truly gives you the feeling that you have the place to yourself! All my guests raved about the food and drinks and I heard several times that it was the best wedding food they had ever had. The waitress and waiters were excellent and all requests were followed! They even helped to set up the room and the cake! The room is perfect for small events and would best serve people who are more focused on good food and good drinks for their guests rather than dancing. Everything about the place is amazing!

The food I&#39;ve tried is really good. The outside seating is gorgeous. I&#39;d say 4.5 stars for food and a 5 for their patio dining. It&#39;s the best lunch spot in all of Naperville. Fish tacos are perfect. --a little heavy of the fresh avocado which is precisely how fish tacos should be! Calamari is light and tender. --No chewy squid on my platter. Seasoned perfectly. My lunch date ordered the Cajun chicken and crab. He loved it, which says a lot for a teenage boy. ;) He said it was perfectly cooked with tons of flavor.

Unfortunately, we live in Midwest were people praise McDonalds and Burger King as highly rated places. For majority of them fine dining is unknown experience and hence it is not wonder that Hugo&#39;s Frog Bar and Fish House in downtown Naperville is well-hidden jewel which remains undiscovered and yet unfairly poorly rated. 

What more one can expect from a restaurant that offers superior service, unbeatable freshens of fish and seafood  and perfectly cooked hearty dishes. However, what certainly won&#39;t happen after eating a perfect meal, the price is not going to be low. However, each dollar they charge at Hugo&#39;s makes perfect sense. Obviously this is too much for people from Midwest who are used on food quality and service from big chain restaurants where the only focus is how to fill your stomach.

Unquestionably, Hugo&#39;s in downtown Naperville, is a top notch FIVE STAR restaurant which offers unique dining experience and atmosphere. Simply there is no comparison to any other nearby places that are trying to charge within the similar price range. 

People who are disappointed by Hugo&#39;s should reconsider their own standards for food and get little bit more informed what is going on in food service industry."

We ordered the crab cake for an appetizer, the bone-in ribeye which was supposed to be a house specialty, the sea scallops, and then the flourless chocolate cake with some cappuccinos. Before we were halfway done with the appetizer, the entrees were brought out which wouldn&#39;t have been that big of a deal, however, both the steak and scallops were undercooked. We asked for Medium/Medium Rare but the steak came out rare. After waiting a while for the server to come back, we just decided to eat what we could because we were both really hungry. When he finally did come back, he offered to bring us a complimentary dessert to make up for the undercooked food. Instead of heating up the remaining more than half of the food, it was thrown in the garbage. For this, the crab cake was knocked off the bill. All said and done, the bill was $90 and only included the steak and scallops that we didn&#39;t even really eat, and coffee. So we paid $90 for an appetizer, dessert, and coffee."

One time we  came in 30 minutes before closing  and were able to order  the $80 seafood appetizer and had drinks at the bar.  The Waitress was great for letting us stay and not rushing us.  The next time we came in way before closing and got  told they are not serving food anymore but we  could order drinks.  I asked the waitress if they  serve drinks, was there  the option of food? That is when she gave me an after hours menu.  Tonight we looked up if we were still  able to go in for an after work cocktail. We checked  the hours it said they closed at 11pm. At 10:20 the doors were locked and people were  walking out and a busboy was helping them out the door. before  we even got a chance to ask if they were no longer seating people, he rushed back in shutting  the door quickly.  We felt really let down since this has been our &#34;Go To&#34; place to get our favorite cocktails and steaks.  We have been loyal to this place and it is a shame that Management has allowed their staff do this.

Not completely sure as it was a few years ago) and thought the food was solid.  I came here last weekend for a small wedding reception and I am so happy my friends chose this venue.  They had reserved a private room (separate entrance from the main restaurant) and it was perfect for the event. There was like five or six different options for mains we could choose from - I went with the filet and my date went with the crab cakes.  My filet was prepared really well (medium-rare of course) with delicious sides of asparagus and this crazy gigantic and delicious twice baked potato.  But the real star of the show was my date&#39;s crab cakes. Two HUGE crab cakes with pretty much all lump crab meat (minimal breading/filler) that were perfectly cooked and seasoned, with some creamy sauce you could drizzle over if you wanted.  They were SO good - I ate half of one of his crab cakes without even thinking about it.  Whoops.  Overall really great experience, our servers were really friendly the food was delicious, and the ambiance charming and warm.  Would definitely come back for dinner if I&#39;m in the area again."

The sign of an outstanding restaurant modifying their preparation for the customer. Given raw oysters on the menu, I was in heaven for the rest of the meal. Shaved malt vinegar to go with the spiced cocktail sauce. Worth the drive from Oswego and one we intend to make numerous times."

The place offers few vegetarian options, nothing past the appetizer section. You might be able to get creative with a salad, but otherwise you&#39;re left in the dark after the first course.

Past the food being limited, our beers were $7 each, which is ridiculous for Naperville. I would expect those kind of prices downtown, but was surprised to see them at their suburbia location.

We might give this place another try, but the first visit wasn&#39;t too promising."

We had an exceptional time to say the least. The food is always fantastic and I knew everyone would be satisfied with what Hugo&#39;s brings to the table. 

Everyone up front is always very kind, professional, well dressed, and accommodating. The decor has a nautical feel that matches the theme of the menu. In the summer they have a patio behind the restaurant that is arguably the nicest patio with the best food in DTN.  

The waiter, Paskel, greeted us with a lot of positive energy. When conducting the food presentation, he appeared to have a genuine love for food and pride in the products Hugo&#39;s serves. My sister is on the no gluten craze,rather than getting a bogus menu, he told her she may order whatever she like and ensured the chefs would make a great meal for her. He was funny and a little goofy, which made my crazy dad relax for once. The staff truly seem to take an interest in the guests overall experience, which can be hard to come by sometimes. 

We all had great meals. Steaks, oysters,and incredibly fresh fish were all enjoyed. I recommend fresh oysters, the crab meat and avocado appetizer, filets or ribeyes, and just about any of their fresh fish options. Their soups are to die for. Paskel mentioned everything is made from scratch in their kitchen, and it&#39;s obvious. GET a martini, they make the best in town. Not to mention the bar is great place to grab lunch or a fun place to people watch. 

Hugo&#39;s never dissapoints, and this experience was one of my best."

The restaurant is a little pricy, so we can only come here for special occasions. Both times, we have ordered the same meal. My girlfriend ordered the frog legs, which are very tasty in the garlic butter, and I ordered the New York strip steak sandwich. The sandwich is good, but I was way more impressed with their giant double baked potato I had for a side. It comes with cheese and bacon on top of it, and is probably the best baked potato I have had. It was fluffy and soft unlike other baked potatoes which can be hard and plain. The service is really great, and the staff is always very attentive. We chose to eat outside when we last dined in, and it was the best thing we did. The atmosphere was beautiful, and will we probably eat outside at Hugo&#39;s from now on, as long as it&#39;s nice out. Definitely a great spot to order seafood in downtown Naperville."

First off, I was impressed with the atmosphere as it was pretty busy for a Tuesday night after work. 

Moving on to the food, this place isn&#39;t cheap. First thing I saw was surf and turf for $94 holy crap. Obviously I wasn&#39;t expecting a cheap meal and it was a business expense so I guess I didn&#39;t even really care that much. I got the filet. I&#39;ll have to say the filet was good but not great. If I&#39;m getting a $50 steak I&#39;m expecting it to be great. It was a little overcooked. One of my coworkers got the crab cakes and said they were pretty bland, after tasting them I&#39;d have to agree. Don&#39;t get me wrong none of the food was bad, just not what I would have hoped for in comparison to the price.

The service was great, so I&#39;ll say 3 stars is pretty fair. I&#39;d be willing to give it another shot."

And despite dating for over six years, we were waiting to get engaged, so our engagement was so impromptu that we didn&#39;t even have a ring; his mother actually gave us one of her own for the occasion. It&#39;s kind of a sad, but still very sweet story, and I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way. 

Despite living out of a hospital, we decided to take a break and celebrate it properly. Christina was our server, and she was incredible throughout the whole night and made sure that our evening was unforgettable. We were just honest with her about our bittersweet engagement, and I was floored with how amazingly we were treated by Christina and the manager. I was all set on the filet mignon, but Christina&#39;s presentation of the different cuts changed my mind, and I had no regrets on my selection of the Chicago cut steak.  

Everything was cooked perfectly, and Christina&#39;s wine pairing selection was spot on, as well. Much to our surprise, our dessert was plated especially for our engagement, complete with candles to make wishes. Christina also went out of her way to take a few pictures of us, which I was able to show to Mom in the hospital. As though our night wasn&#39;t special enough, our appetizer, dessert, and champagne were comped, which was completely unexpected. 

Truly, a night I will never forget, and I look forward to anniversaries at Hugo&#39;s. I cannot pay high enough compliments to the staff and management, nor have I ever had a dining experience as wonderful as that night was. My mother enjoyed all our our pictures and was so happy that we were able to celebrate our engagement properly as per her wishes. She died one week later at age 54, 3 months shy of her 30th wedding anniversary, with four kids aged 28, 26, 22, and 20. It meant so much that Hugo&#39;s was so understanding and kind during this difficult part of our lives. My mother was able to briefly enjoy our engagement and the pictures of our dinner before dying one week later. Many thanks to Hugo&#39;s."

I had the steak salad for dinner and it was ok.  Our service could have been better, our waitress wasn&#39;t very attentive.  She never asked if we needed another drink we would have to tell her, didn&#39;t refill our waters, and brought our check before asking if we needed anything else which we did.

It was New Year&#39;s Eve by the way and I was looking for a nicer place and didn&#39;t want to spend an arm and a leg on some good food. 

The restaurant itself has a really cool feel, kind of cross between and old school steakhouse and a New Orleans style bar. Plenty of people and decorations for New Years. 

It was easy to get a reservation using open table the day before New Years which was kind of unexpected. We showed up about 10 minutes prior to our reservation and maybe waited 15 minutes. So not to bad. Our waiter did a great job very attentive and always made sure we had what we needed. I got myself a draft Sam Adams and my fianc√© had a glass of wine both reasonably priced. We skipped appetizers and went straight for entrees. They had plenty to choose from but again trying not to spend like crazy I ended up with a marinated skirt steak with giardinera and she got a roasted white fish with tomato and onion and mashed potatoes.

Probably because they got automatic gratuity. Not even the server, let alone a manager, came to our steaks after they were cut.  

My 30oz steak was raw inside along with two other undercooked steaks--two of the larger filets and my WR Chicago Cut.  It took a long time to order and many drinks went empty.  Even coffee at the end took awhile to arrive.

We got the seafood tower, I had an oyster and a shrimp.  I got a large chunk of shell with my oyster which ruined it. 

I ordered a Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale, I ask the bartender if it was from Goose Island (which I thought was a very slim chance) and he didn&#39;t know who made it.  Its by Lexington and not good if you want to know.  My second beer was an Anti Hero by Revolution, as always it was delicious.  They had Matilda by Goose Island and a couple Left Hand brews but nothing unusual.

We ordered a Key Lime pie too.  It was immensely underwhelming.

I would give them 2 stars but the seafood entrees were good and I&#39;ve been to the one in Rivers Casino (also undercooked the steak but by less of a margin) where I had excellent service."

My main course was terrible. I got the fish tacos which looked so beautiful but as soon as I took my first bite I knew what a terrible terrible mistake I had made. The tortilla fought the fish and made it taste dirty, I know it sounds crazy but it did, so I discarded the shell. I was then left with a tasteless white fish (there was absolutely no seasoning at all on it) and no matter what I tried it with I was left disappointed..I tried it plain, with lime, with cole slaw, salted, with salsa, with tartar sauce..nothing helped. I felt defeated and underwhelmed munching on my tasteless tacos. 

Note to Hugo&#39;s: For being such an upscale restaurant I was a bit upset to see there wasn&#39;t a gluten free bread option when you have a gluten free menu. Places that charge a third of your prices offer that option so why don&#39;t you? If you ever decide to get with the times (gluten free is super trendy right now) and start serving gluten free bread send me a message and I will gladly come back in and give your establishment another try.

Hugo is a chump...I was here with a colleague this evening and can only describe our dinner as sub par. So, the appetizer of Tuna Poke was good. I wouldn&#39;t rate it as great, but it was tolerable- bits of tuna overpopulated with under ripe mango and pineapple. The wine list is over priced with mediocre bottles priced way above want market rate should be. For my dinner I ordered the strip cooked &#39;Pittsburgh&#39; style and got a medium well steak. The only positive was the waitstaff. James and Fanny were outstanding servers. The manger- when a customer tries to deliver positive feedback you might want to listen rather than wave him off in plain sight. Mediocre food. Over priced wine. Avoid. There are other places that are much better for the money."

The service was outstanding. Let me tell you everyone was really hustling to ensure diners has a great experience. I had Lobster Bisque soup. It was a bit disappointing because there were no chunks of lobster. I&#39;ve had better at other places. For dinner I had King Crab legs. I&#39;m a bit particular about crab legs and like them steaming hot. The waiter had my plate come out last and the dish was piping hot and delicious. For dessert I shared chocolate mousse, which was tasty and homemade carrot cake, another winner. Sadly my husband ordered grouper and was disappointed. It was tough and lacked flavor. Other guests at our table ordered lobster stuffed shrimp (which I&#39;ll order next time) and you can&#39;t go wrong with the filet mignon.  I&#39;ve near had a bad meal at Hugo&#39;s.

I&#39;m doing the low carb diet so I had the W.R. Chicago Cut Steak and my wife had the Halibut.

I ordered a rare steak and the steak came out with absolutely no seasoning.  It was simply a hunk of meat thrown on a grill for a few minutes.  Wow it was disappointing especially since the thing was $53.

My wife ordered the Halibut and the same thing.  Just bland and flavorless.  My kid ordered the crab legs and they where  overcooked and rubbery.

Ifit had been just one item, we would have sent it back but it was a table of dismay.

It honestly looks like they have great ingredients and no clue how to use them.

The worst value for flavor combo dining experience I&#39;ve ever had.  We will not be repeating.

Just disappointing...  total bill 300 bucks including tip for 4 people.

P.S.  the steak sliders are still good.  The only reason they got 1 star back."

A warning though, it can be a little expensive, but you could also come here and have a great meal at a great price depending on what/how you order.  I would recommend coming here for lunch to give it a shot and then see whether or not you&#39;re willing to come and pay for dinner.  The steaks and the sea bass are awesome, and they have some pretty good desserts, but I have to say that none of their appetizers really get my motor running.  If you&#39;re just coming drinks, they&#39;re expensive, but the bar crowd isn&#39;t as loud and boisterous as other places in downtown Naperville, which sometimes makes it worth the money.  Great service too!"

It competes in the upper dining tier where the quality of food needs to meet discriminating tastes.  As an honorary carnivore, I came to check out their ability to prepare a blue steak. It is the ultimate way to appreciate a fine steak in its optimal state.  I had the Chicago-cut ribeye that is one generous portion. Establishments of this caliber is expected to be able to make a black and blue well.  And I am very pleased that Hugo&#39;s delivered that experience.  The only improvement is the aging.  I personally think it could be better to achieve greater tenderness.

We had a number of sides including the perfunctory frog legs.  The legs were more tender that my experience elsewhere.  It&#39;s a conversation item to order but not a dish to define this place.  The lobsters and a medley of sides we ordered were well executed.  

In short, the atmosphere, service and the level of cuisine were very good and defines this place well. High recommended if you are prepared to come with a liberal expense or are on expense account."

He was on top of our orders, he had a sense of humor without overstepping or being too obnoxious.  

The cocktails I tried were delicious -grasshopper and pear something or other.  I&#39;d definitely go back for the cocktails.  If only the food was on par with the drinks and service!

We tried the calamari, frog legs and mussels for appetizer.  The calamari was the best of the bunch.  It was seasoned well and came with a more interesting sauce than the typical cocktail or marinara sauce.  The frog legs were decent, but slight too buttery.  The mussels were the tiniest I&#39;ve ever seen.  I&#39;m not sure how they managed to get such tiny mussels, you&#39;d think there would be one medium sized one thrown in by mistake!  Think, 10% the size of the shell.  The flavor of the broth was different and nice but somehow didn&#39;t really go into the mussels.  The bread dipped in the sauce was good, but the tiny mussels were just a phantom of chewiness between bites.

The lobster roll looked great, but had too much mayo and not enough of the dill/brightness to offset the lobster and mayo.  The roll was good but a bit soggy.  The fries that came with were inconsistently crisp but seasoned well.  They were like McDonalds fries that were left in the bag.  The tomahawk steak was cooked right, but bland.  I didn&#39;t try it but someone thought the tuna was the best dish we got that night.

Overall, the drinks were fantastic but the food was not good enough for the price.  I think they need to up the food quality or lower the price for better ratings.  The live music was also pretty poor.. sorry, but it made me wonder why bother?"

We dinned there for dinner and had amazing service and food. The waiter (can&#39;t remember his name) was excellent and knew exactly what to ask and when to ask he. He also always came over to see how everything was going which was very nice.

As for the food, the seafood was a fresh as you would ever get. It was very very tasty and well worth it.

We had 7pm reservations and were seated in the busy restaurant right away. As soon as we sat, someone came and filled our water glasses and brought bread. 

The service was ok, our server Stacy was very friendly and helpful when she was at the table, but she didn&#39;t come back as often as I would have liked. 

The shrimp cocktail was AMAZING..$4 a piece and comes on a huge bed of ice with lemon, cocktail sauce and horseradish. I also had the loaded wedge salad that was delicious! For my entree I got the crab cake sandwich, which I was not a fan of. It was a little too fishy for my taste..but it was large and came on a bun with mayo, lettuce, tomato and onion. The fries were amazing, seasoned very well.

My boyfriend had the sliders and this was really our only big problem at dinner. He ordered 2 hamburger sliders PLAIN, well done and 1 filet slider well done. None of the meat was even medium well, it was very very pink. We sent it back and waited about 10 minutes. When it came out again, it was still pink and the burgers were not plain. He&#39;s a picky eater so he didn&#39;t finish and Stacy apologized and took it off the bill. The seasoned kettle chips that came with the sliders were delicious, however.

For dessert we got the mud pie, which was fantastic. I can&#39;t even explain it..but it was big enough for 4 people, no joke. We had to take 2 slices home.

I also had the dragonberry lemonade, which was Bacardi of some sort with lemonade and it was really good. It was $10, which was the cheapest on the menu, some of the drinks were upwards of $17 each which seems ridiculous. 

I also liked that valet was free, although we did park in a garage around the corner. I would definitely go back, but I would get a steak or a piece of fish next time."

Being in the &#34;Chinatown&#34; area of Naperville, there are a lot of Asian places to try.

The food is really good.  Plenty of variety and different dishes.  They are small, so it can get really crowded, but the food comes out quick.  If you have never been there before, here are some of my favorites:

-  Spicy dumplings
-  salt and pepper calamari
-  spicy beef soup
-  eggplant dish.  It&#39;s fried and yummy"

It&#39;s sort of tucked away out of view from Ogden, and I always forget if it&#39;s on Naper Blvd or Naperville Wheaton Rd (and why the heck are there two roads with practically the same name that intersect, seriously people?!).

At any rate, expect to find this place pretty jam packed on a weekday during lunch. That&#39;s because the food is awesome and there are a TON of options on the menu. The weird thing about the tofu part of the menu is that the entire first page has tofu with other types of meat (totally not suitable for vegetarians or vegans), but the second page (yes, a second page of tofu options!) is pretty much straight up veggie fare. The general tso&#39;s tofu wins the game for me. I don&#39;t even order anything else. I think Mapo is the only place in Naperville that has general tso&#39;s tofu, so I basically win whenever I eat here.

Perhaps I want to keep it a secret lol. Dry chili chicken and mapo tofu are a must try dish. Schezuan cold noodle is my  favorite and order it everytime.

If you like food with flavor and kick, this is a great choice. The Chinese food here is not typical American style,  so be prepared for a different experience. 

If your new to this style. Order the beef roll, dry chili chicken basil chicken or hunan chicken your first time there. You will not be disappointed and will not shock the taste buds. It will have more body and flavor then your typical American style chinese food, and a touch spicy"

This is family style with a lazy Susan in the middle of the table and we ended up with a million entrees. 3 kinds Of Mushrooms was good although bland. The wife found that it was good mixed with tofu. 

Shrimp with basil was also good. 

There were two soups, sizzling rice/chicken soup and tofu soup. The chicken soup was good, but the tofu soup tasted like nothing. 

The egg rolls were the frozen Sysco variety and unimpressive. There should be higher quality rolls or remove then from the menu. 

One obviously fresh item was the green beans. They were well cooked and seasoned. 

The Mongolian beef was good. We also had balls of fried chicken but I don&#39;t know what to call them. They were good. She reported that the tofu was the best item on the menu."

This is always a good sign of things to come.  We had a group of nine and two of the diners were very picky eaters who didn&#39;t want anything spicy or &#34;unusual&#34;.  We ordered an abundance of food to make sure we got some dishes for the non adventurous eaters.  

The Fish Fillet in broiled oil sauce was amazing.  This dish had an enormous amount of spice and flavor.  I&#39;ve never had anything like this before and would definitely order it again.  The Sichuan green beans were flavorful and made for a good vegetarian dish.  The Curry Chicken and the Basil Chicken were very good with a nice amount of heat.  I&#39;ve eaten a lot of tofu but have never had anything like the Salt and Pepper Egg Tofu.  It was coated and deep fried and the interior was very creamy.  I enjoyed the dish but a couple of people were put off by the texture. 

The service was quick and efficient.  They have many authentic and outstanding dishes."

We started our dinner with an order of egg rolls.  They were served hot and were crisp and flavorful. We then had hot and sour soup. It was very nice; the hot and sour were well balanced and not overpowering. For our main dishes, my wife had the Mongolian beef and I had the yu shan chicken. The beef in my wife&#39;s dish was very flavorful she very much enjoyed this dinner course. The yu shan chicken I had was nicely spiced and tasted good. The black mushrooms were very nice. The wait staff was attentive and the dinner was served with complementary tea. My only critique is that the restaurant was a little too quiet.  I know that seems odd, but it was almost silent as we dined.  A little quiet background music would have been nice.

If you&#39;re in the Naperville area and looking for some good Chinese food, give Mapo a try - you won&#39;t be disappointed."

That being said, many of the menu items are spicy. I came here with a group of 8 and some of those dining with me could only eat select dishes that we ordered (we decided on family style) because they were intolerant to spicy foods. 

Three delicacies: this was probably gobbled down the fastest because it was a dish everyone could enjoy--it included shrimp, chicken, scallop, squid, beef and Chinese vegetables.

Mapo tofu: although the restaurant is known for this dish, I was impartial to it and I probably wouldn&#39;t order it again.

Fish fillet and mushroom in sour pickle sauce: most of us enjoyed this dish. It does come out almost soup-like.

Yu shan eggplant: most of us either liked it or hated it--there was no in between. Those that hated it thought it was bland, but I thought that the eggplant was flavorful and was cooked just right.

The owners were not too pleased when we tried to split the bill amongst us and we wanted to each pay with credit cards since the transaction fee is high (sorryyy) so one person paid with a credit card for the group."

Used to live around the area and I&#39;ve been to all Chinese restaurants and this one is it. It&#39;s a bit pricier here, but the quality and selection makes up for it. A lot of nice authentic dishes here. I really like the mapo tofu, shui zhu fish, and beef noodle soup.

In this particular last visit, we ordered the tian fu tofu, pickled cabbage and fish soup, and garlic shrimp. We came for a really late lunch, and the food came out in less than 10 minutes.

Tian Fu Tofu - I like how soft the tofu is and the flavoring is authentic as it can get. Spicy and salty and heavily sauced. Goes great with rice. However, I could never finish this in a setting because it is a serious diet killer.

Pickled Cabbage and Fish Soup - A pretty simple dish but delicious and healthier. I love the pickled taste of the soup and there is also glass noodles. I like to add white pepper to this giving a kick of heat. The fish is your typical fish fillet, nothing fancy.

Garlic Shrimp - I really like the crust of the deep fried shrimp here. It&#39;s a bit more crunchy and thick. Plenty of garlic flavor coming from the sauce. I thought the sauce was a bit too salty. But in my family, more flavor is better than less flavor."

Going in for lunch is a great deal, as you get a soup, an egg roll, and a full meal for like $10. Getting take-out from here for dinner though has been hit or miss. The orange chicken is exceptionally strange. It&#39;s like ground up chicken formed into meatballs and then deep fried? They were surprisingly difficult to eat.

I think we either ordered the wrong dishes or have different expectations than the other patrons in the restaurant (which was completely full, mostly with people of Asian descent).  

The service was awful - we were waiting for the rest of our party to arrive so I could understand being completely ignored until they got there but our server continued to ignore us for another 20 minutes after they arrived.  We were hoping to go see a 730p show and arrived at 515p for dinner....we ended up being there for two hours!

We finally ordered: Shrimp with Lobster Sauce, Mongolian Chicken, Spicy Beef Soup
Fried Rice, Combination Rice Noodle Dish.  The best of the bunch was the Mongolian Chicken but I&#39;ve yet to go to an Asian restaurant that can mess-up Mongolian Chicken.  
The Shrimp with Lobster Sauce was the weirdest I&#39;ve ever had - it included peas and carrots and the sauce was very light (almost clear) and had no flavor at all.  My husband did enjoy the (very) Spicy Beef Soup. 

We waited forever for our food to be served and when it finally came out, after asking about it a few times, they served one dish at a time with several minutes in between each dish so we weren&#39;t able to enjoy our food together.  It was odd that everyone around us (many people who arrived after us) were getting their food quicker and all at once....it must have been what they ordered.  

There are at least 10 places in the area that have better food and much better service than Mapo (Joy Yee is one of them and right down the street).  We won&#39;t be going back and I wouldn&#39;t recommend this place to anyone."

I have been looking for a place that does spicy beef noodle soup and they nailed it. Service was very sweet, fast, great. Like their big round tables with a lazy susan for families to share. Only complaint is no alcohol and you cannot bring your own either. For dinner, I would have loved a little saki on the side with my soup. For lunch though, is perfect."

Ones in the menu are good, but they have hidden menu.  When you see something that you don&#39;t see in the menu, you need to ask the ladies.  

Yes, they can be rude but they can be pretty nice when you come to know them well.  So, don&#39;t hesitate to ask them.  They will like you once you start to show interest to their real food.

The food is exceptional.  Please try dry chili chicken, Szechuan style kung pao chicken, and Mapo tofu.  This can be very spicy, so I recommend that you ask them to make it mild.

Try some of the food the Chinese people are eating next to your table.  They are so good.  

By the time you know, you won&#39;t care how rude the ladies can be.  You are going to come to like them too."

Mapo knows the way to my heart, stomach, and wallet.  Lunch specials include soup (hot and sour or egg drop), spring roll, fried rice, and your choice of entree.  Last week, one of my co-workers suspiciously also got a crab rangoon out of the deal, but I&#39;m not sure how to procure that.

I&#39;ve never been a fan of soups at Chinese restaurants, but I have to admit I kind of liked their hot and sour.  The broth was a little thicker than usual, and the spiciness lit a small fire in my belly.  

The Kung Pao Chicken was really good.  I prefer Mapo&#39;s Kung Pao over any other Chinese place.  Watch out for those little red chilies!  They&#39;re fairly inconsistent in how they use them.  Dominic P.&#39;s Kung Pao had probably 10 of these little fire bits, whereas my dish only had 1!

The service isn&#39;t spectacular, but it isn&#39;t terrible either.  We were waited on fairly quickly and our food arrived in no time at all.  This place is very busy during the weekday lunch hour, but I didn&#39;t feel rushed at all.

The interior is clean with simple decor, including granny doily style table cloths.  I could do without the soft, instrumental music though.

I went here with my friend for a work lunch and I have to say I was impressed. Mapo is tucked away in the corner of a strip mall that looks pretty run down. I was skeptical that this was going to be good chinese food. Actually I feared that it was going to put me in the bathroom for the rest of the day, as most chinese food (that isn&#39;t good) does that. I looked over their lunch menu and prices are cheap, around $7 bucks. 
You get a lot for the price. I went with the orange chicken and wow. I got a nice size of deliciously chunked chicken in a fresh, rich, and spicy orange glaze sauce. This was paired with the perfect amount of fried rice and golden brown crab rangoon. The only thing that was a little disappointing was the egg roll.
Service was friendly, food came out quick, and our drinks were always topped off. It&#39;s a great place to grab a quick bite, have a meal that has great fresh ingredients, and is friendly to your wallet."

As I walked towards the restaurant, I saw on old man sitting outside selling fresh vegetables.  Before I could squint to see what was on his table, the sweet aroma of delicious food held my olfactory hostage.  Mmm...I was salivating already.

The host seated us promptly in a booth by the wall.  I love booths.  It&#39;s so cozy and intimate.  For larger groups, there were plenty of tables in the dining area.  The decor is nice and modern.  As I looked around, I noticed the extremely high Asian ratio (95%).  This place MUST be good.

As I poured over the menu, it seemed that a decision would be hard to make because there were so many options.  Then I saw IT!  They have dan dan noodles!  Well, technically - Dong Dong noodles, here.  But as a tip, I suggest you pronounce it dan dan.  I went with dong-dong pronunciation and the waitress gave me a strange looked and repeated my order back to me saying dan-dan.

Dong Dong/Dan Dan Noodles - $8.  It&#39;s only natural for me to compare this dish to Katy Dumpling House.  Mapo&#39;s is $1 more, this dish is bigger, the sauce is more creamy and peanutty, tons more meat and pickled veggies, and the noodles are more like flat spaghetti than fat udon.  It was good, but definitely contains less crack than Katy&#39;s dan dan noodles.

Country style smoked pork belly - $11  It was good, but I&#39;m not that fond of pork belly, so I wasn&#39;t in love with it.  It came with leeks, jalapeno and garlic.

The service was amazingly quick.  Complimentary hot tea was on the table before I even realized it.  The food was prepared in no time.  The waitress magically appeared when I needed her most."

That&#39;s why I was thrilled when I found Mapo conveniently located in Naperville by H-Mart (it&#39;s also a struggle to find large Asian grocery stores). I tried three dishes here and all three were done so well I can&#39;t wait to go back. Be aware though, the cooking style is authentic Chinese so the items may contain more fat or spice than what you are used to.

Tea smoked duck - Crispy on the outside, tender meat on the inside with tons of smoke flavor. This is one of the best you&#39;ll find in the suburbs and unlike some other restaurants, this isn&#39;t covered in sauce so you can clearly taste the smoke flavor. Most of the fat is mostly removed by the cooking process so you are left with a strong meat and skin flavor.

Dry chili chicken - If you loved the version from Yilin or Lao Sze Chuan, you&#39;re sure to love this one as well. The chicken is battered and fried to a crisp here with a strong flavor of ginger and garlic to complement the chili. This comes in a huge portion and is not overly spicy (don&#39;t be fooled, dry chili is more aromatic than spicy). Even if you aren&#39;t into authentic Chinese cuisine -- you have to try this dish. Once you do, you can never go back to eating popcorn chicken again.

Mao&#39;s favorite pork belly - Delicious pieces of fatty pork belly in a tasty broth. This is a famous Hunan dish with tons of different ingredients that make up the delicious broth but the true magic is in the combination of all the ingredients over rice.It&#39;s hard to describe but I know you&#39;ll love it. 

The execution of these 3 dishes was great in all aspects - visual, smell, taste, and texture so I can&#39;t wait to go back and give my senses another treat soon."

In my opinion, Mapo serves up some of the best Chinese you can get outside of the Chicago city limits. We&#39;ve tried their Mongolian chicken, Mongolian Beef, Kung Pao chicken, Sesame Chicken, chicken fried rice, and a few other dishes. All of these dishes were really good. 

However, on one occasion I has to use their restroom and it wasn&#39;t a nice experience. It was dirty including lots of &#34;fluid&#34; on the floor and it was falling apart. We still go when we want good Chinese, we just avoid the restroom."

The vegetable tofu soup and the spring rolls are vegetarian.  The other veggie options are spread out amongst the Cold Dishes, Vegetable, Tofu, and Noodle sections.  They have some interesting-sounding non-veg selections, such as frog, or tofu with pork blood.  Veg items included the Vegetable Delight, which I found more interestingly spiced than at many places; General Tso&#39;s Tofu (have not seen this elsewhere), and the Basil Tofu, which is just as good as everyone else said.  They even have a potato dish, which is essentially fried potato shreds with a couple of scallions sprinkled over them.  Tasty, but would be disappointing if your only entree.

They&#39;re not the most flexible; I asked if I could get the Eggplant in Garlic Sauce and make it Eggplant and Green Beans in Garlic Sauce (&#34;No,&#34; said our waitress), but they were willing to add vegetables to my tofu for a $1 upcharge.  Since most of the tofu dishes are basically tofu in sauce, you may want to consider this.  The Basil Tofu is spicy, with hits of garlic, and the Vegetarian Chicken goes one better than some other Chinese places and stuffs the tofu skin with mushrooms.  Nice.  Vegetables were not overcooked; food took a while but was certainly worth it.  And they handled 12 people with separate checks very well."

I still try to come here, but since I live so close to Chinatown, it isn&#39;t a priority to come here. This place is pretty good for the most part. It is definitely comparable to the Lao&#39;s chain in Chinatown, but I like this place slightly more. What we always order...

Mapo Beef Rolls - They are wrapped in foil, but they are just okay for the most part. Sometimes the wrap is really crunchy and you can&#39;t really taste the beef. I would still recommend this because all the other times they were pretty good.

Dry Chili Chicken - Breaded chicken cooked with tons of red peppers. This dish is my favorite thing here and it always deliver! It is not too spicy like other places and the breading is mostly perfect. The last time I was here, the breading was a little too crunchy.

Mongolian Beef - They are not shady with the amount of beef they give you. The beef is also nice and tender. Not chewy like other places.

Mapo Tofu - This dish is extremely spicy for me, but I absolutely love it. 

Seared Fish Fillet - This fish fillet is cooked with garlic sauce and it is not drenched in sauce like most places. Definitely a must try if you are looking for a fish fillet entree.

Overall, I don&#39;t think anything you get here can be too bad. Everything we tried was pretty good."

I have never seen that in all my 30+ years it was shocking and amusing at the same time! &#34;WOW&#34; this must be the Chinese version of Ed Debevic&#39;s if so bravo! Anyways I only had the wonton soup it was ok we shall see what my kids think of the fried rice... 1 star for service 1 star for the soup.. I&#39;ll stick w/my usual take out spot

The tea served with food was very good and well brewed.  We tried several foods and I fell in love with two of them: the rib which wad flavored by the right amount of cumin and also the fried eggplant stuffed with mushroom (do not remember the name). I also tried dong dong noodle which was a bit spicy but the sauce made with sesame is not a thing you could find everywhere. There is just one thing that makes me give them 3 stars and that is the way its waitress behaved at the end; she told the amount of tip my friend added to the check was not enough and he should change it! A thing we never expected.

We used to eat here at least once a month and it was always good.  The servers were attentive for our standard at Asian restaurants.  They took our orders promptly, bring food out as it is ready and filled drinks when they are empty.  I have ate at other Szechuan restaurants and always wish that I was eating at Mapo instead.  Favorite dishes included beef rolls, fish fillets with boiled oil sauce, fish fillet with pickle vegetable, wok seared fish, lamb with cumin, and many others."

I found that very unusual. I asked a waiter and they had a conversation in Chinese and then he said no too even though he was going to get it.

Mapo Restaurant, however, is a cozy good Chinese restaurant in the neighborhood.
My husband and I ordered two kinds of soup, vegetable delight, potstickers and mapo tofu, and every dish was so tasty and good.  Especially mapo tofu was just like what we used to have at some very fancy restaurants in our home town Tokyo.
I had thought many of the customers would be Chinese, but probably more than a half were non-Chinese.  Their service might be a bit different from what is expected in other American restaurants, but it was quite all right for us.
We&#39;ll definitely go back.  Lunch special sounds good too."

Excellent food, friendly and fast service, comfortable atmosphere.

The long of it:

I came here for lunch on a whim, just me and my almost-2-year-old daughter. The entire staff was immediately enamored of her, saying hi, pulling faces at her, and generally being silly to try and get her to smile (which is a good thing in my book).

I ordered the lunch special #22, &#34;Three Delicacies,&#34; a dish with beef, chicken, shrimp, a bunch of veggies and brown rice. It came with egg drop soup and a spring roll, which were both delicious.

The main dish came out very quickly and the smell wafting from it made my mouth water, literally. It was a mixture between your normal &#34;Chinese restaurant food&#34; smell, garlic, meats, and fresh vegetables. The taste was a perfect amalgamation of all these things.

My daughter enjoyed it all, too, eating a baby-sized bite for every two of my bites. She had a few things that she&#39;s never had before and asked for more of everything. She learned new vocabulary, like &#34;baby corn,&#34; &#34;bamboo hearts&#34; and &#34;water chestnut.&#34; Sure, she pronounces them all wrong but we&#39;ll call it close enough.

Seriously, for only $11 with tip I was able to enjoy an extraordinary Chinese lunch special with my daughter. We will make it a habit of coming here."

Food was delicious as always but service was a bit slow, probably because there were many large groups there on a Saturday night. 
We started with the cold Szechuan noodles - spicy and delicious as were the Szechuan wontons with pork. All our entrees were equally tasty - Mongolian beef, shrimp with garlic and the yu chuan eggplant (candied, sweet taste - the best eggplant dish ever)."

When driving by one night I noticed Mapo Restaurant and decided to give it a try with no idea of what they served beforehand. I came in, was greeted, seated and looked over the menu and was pleased to discover they are a fairly traditional Chinese restaurant.

As I looked over the menu I settled on two of my favorite Chinese dishes, Crab Rangoon as an appetizer, and General Tso&#39;s chicken as the entree. I then sat and admired the atmosphere, the place is very clean with lots of employees visible at all times, for such a small place it almost seemed a bit overstaffed. It&#39;s also a little on the dark side inside with very minimal lighting. I find that to be plesant but that might not be everyone&#39;s cup of tea. 

Within a few minutes the crab rangoon was brought out to me, and it was pretty good. It was well breaded and had a nice cheese to meat balance. I&#39;ve definitely had better crab rangoon before, but this was well above average. Then came the General Tso&#39;s chicken, on the plus side this chicken tasted excellent with a nice more sweet than hot sauce mixed in with vegetables. On the down side I had more than a few pieces of chicken that were tougher than I would expected as though they were dried out or overcooked.

Overall I was pleased with my visit to Mapo Restaurant, my food was good, the service was excellent. It was a little pricier than some other, admittedly not as well decorated Chinese restaurants that have equal or better food. Based on that I&#39;m going to award it three stars. It&#39;s worth visiting if you&#39;re in the area and willing to spend a little more for the sake of ambiance."

If you have ever been to mainland China or Taiwan, this &#39;feels&#39; just like one of those great little hole in the wall places famous for great food. Not great decor, not clean bathrooms, not great service with wait staff fawning over you and developing fake small talk to entertain you. Just great Chinese food, period. 

You are there to order food and talk with your friends. Who cares about your personal relationship with the wait staff, they are only there to order your food and get it to your table without fuss. That is authentic Chinese. That is how it is in China. If you hem and haw and take too long to order your food, the wait staff will move on and try to get back to you after they have taken orders from more &#39;decisive&#39; customers. :) Especially if it is busy. 

Order quickly and decisively, double check to make sure the wait staff has the order right, then sit back, drink some tea and enjoy the company of your friends until the food arrives. If it seems late, just tell them ÊàëÈ§ìÊ≠ªÔºåÂì™Ë£°ÊòØÊàëÁöÑËèúÔºüÂìàÂìàÂìà :)

Of course the Mapo Tofu with fish is the best I&#39;ve ever tasted.  The dry chili chicken is equally good.  The only reason I won&#39;t order it again is because I&#39;ve never had bad dry chilly chicken anywhere.  I&#39;d rather save my taste buds for something else.  The basil eggplant was also equally outstanding.   The dong dong noodle was pretty good but I think I&#39;ll again save my taste buds for something else.  I was really impressed with salted spare ribs with cumin spicy.  They were so meaty that it was unreal.  No fat.  I was surprised how much I liked the cumin.  I wish the place was more convenient to where I live.  I was looking for a place before going to a concert in Naperville.
After thought. . . Upon finishing this review, I had Mapo leftovers.  I enjoyed it as if I&#39;ve never had Chinese food before.  They use styrofoam!  What Chinese restaurant uses styrofoam?  Last year though the leftover Mapo with fish looked a lot smaller in the hard clear circular container.   I seemed to get all of it in the styrfoam container."

When we walked in, I noticed that there were many Chinese families dining there (which is a great sign). It was quite busy, but we were sat promptly. 

We enjoyed the complimentary jasmine tea, and had a chance to absorb the ambiance. Simply decorated, yet cozy- woven together delicately with some mild Chinese instrumentals. The menu is extensive and provides pictures of highlighted items. I ordered the broiled beef in hot Sichuan sauce (picture was provided), when it came out (came out fast) it was identical to the picture in the menu. The beef was succulent and flavorful- rich in garlic, and red pepper- the green onions and cabbage really enhanced the flavor sensation- beautiful dish! I was astounded with how tender the beef was, the quality of the meat was very good and you could tell.

We also ordered the American favorite- Crispy chicken in tangy sweet sauce. I will say the dish was tasty no doubt, but it was a tad too crispy, needed more actual chicken than the fried batter. This minor set back definitely did not over shadow our great experience and our desire to come back. I plan on digging into their seafood portion of the menu next time we go. Best Chinese place in Chicagoland that I&#39;ve been to- But beware, the bill will climb very fast if you order a lot (tad expensive), the portions are very generous so keep that in mind. Enjoy!"

My boyfriend and I were so excited to go to our favorite Joy Yee Noodles in Naperville until were drove up and realized it was closed. So we looked at asian restaurants in the area, and according to the reviews, this was the best place around. We walked in, and immediately, the place was not impressive. The hostess seemed very bored and uninterested in us. After we requested a table for two we had to awkwardly stand there because the lady just walked off, did not say ANYTHING. Ok. 
So we get seated and the table is dirty... there is a piece of rice laying on it which the hostess takes with her hand and throws on the floor right in front of us.... all righty then. We order our food from a menu what was NOTHING compared to the options you get at Joy Yee (i miss that place so much). Our food arrived and it was nothing exciting our authentic looking. It did not taste special, in fact, it was all very boring. The noodle based dished very VERY heady on noodles, which are cheap but also extremely plain...go figure. All I could say is that after we finished eating, I wished we had never started. There is nothing worse than paying money and forcing your body to digest something less than enjoyable...nothing makes you realize more that life is short, and every meal should be enjoyed, especially the ones you pay money for. The interior of this place is plain gross. FYI- it does not take much money to patch up the holes in  your walls and give them a fresh coat of paint. Call me picky- but I consider my time and money to be precious, I do not ever want to waste it on businesses like this. The ones that treat me like they are doing me a favor by seating my at a table that&#39;s not clean and serving me food that I later regretted eating. No thanks. Never again. #JoyYeeForLife


One thing I forgot to mention, the main thing actually:

When my boyfriend and I sat down, we were given plates and ....forks. Now, there is nothing wrong with forks, but we were at an asian restaurant where majority of the customers were asian, and ALL of them were eating with chop sticks. We were not even given the option of using chop sticks, which I found very offensive and discriminative. I have never been treated with such prejudice at a restaurant before, safe to say it was very rude of the hosts/servers to assume/decide for us."

4 stars for the food - love their Dry Chili Chicken, Kung Pao Beef, and their Spare Ribs. I love spicy Chinese food and I think this is really what they do best.

2 stars for the service - I asked the lady waiting on us if she could provide a recommendation, to which she replied, &#34;Just order from the menu!&#34; No asking if everything came out great, if you need napkins, or anything. Eat yo food and get the F out!

Most Chinese restaurants value the food at a restaurant much more than the ambiance and service so the focus is really more on just how the food tastes. Maybe a cultural difference between the Chinese and Americans?"

We also ordered Mapo&#39;s special mapo tofu with fish. This was delicious as well. I had never had mapo tofu with fish, only with ground pork or vegetarian. The fish was an interesting take on the traditional mapo tofu dish. I liked it a lot.

It&#39;s a pot of spicy offal stew. In it were preserved mustard, tofu, pork intestine slices and congealed pork blood cubes. Yum? I liked it, but I&#39;m sure that most people wouldn&#39;t. 

The last two dishes I mentioned were spicy but not too much. I thought it had the right amount of spiciness, but my boyfriend continued to add more and more hot chili oil. That was surprising to me because these dishes were practically swimming in hot chili oil! I also thought the offal stew was just a tad more spicy than the mapo tofu even though to be quite honest, after eating the two together, the taste kind of became one. The offal stew also reminded me very slightly of the Mexican menudo dish (probably because of the offal) except that I did enjoy the addition of the slightly sour taste of the preserved mustard (FYI, I don&#39;t like menudo at all). I  thought the mustard and the tofu helped to tone down the off-putting smell of the offal. 

For our &#34;non-spicy&#34; dish, we ordered the Sichuan green beans. Sichuan is known for their spicy food, but this was the mildest food item (aside from the appetizer) that we got. This was pretty good too, but it was nothing spectacular. 

I&#39;d come back if I am ever in the neighborhood again."

one of my favorites used to be their beef roll app with scallion pancakes, egg, and beef all wrapped together. last time I tried this, it just tasted try and flavorless..

their fried eggplant is pretty good as are their spicy hot pots filled with intestines and pork blood according to the rest of my family...haha I can&#39;t quite comment as it&#39;s not a particular favorite of mine."

Some of my favorites are the Mapo Tofu which is basically spicy lava and tofu, let it cool down a bit before biting in and enjoy the flavors.  Another dish that is great is their spicy beef noodle soup.  This soup is typically packed with flavors from cloves and even a hint of garlic!  The beef is typically tender and comes apart with a spoon.  These meals are HUGE so defiantly plan on taking back half.  My only gripe is that the consistency is not very good.  I&#39;m not sure if the soup inconsistency is due to the port not being stirred or if they ran out of ingredients those days."

In fact, this is the ONLY reason we kept coming. What I find really strange however is that every time the service has been really terrible, even by Chinese restaurant standards.

The first time we came, our food came in one hour late because our waiter had forgotten to give our order to the kitchen. Hey I understand shit happens, you&#39;re overworked etc. But after we left, our waiter ran out after us asking us why we didn&#39;t tip, something I have never experienced before in my life....

The second time we came, they got our order wrong.

The third time we came in around 9 pm. Mapo&#39;s closing time is 10 pm, but they were already turning off the lights and in the process of closing the store. The wait staff was obviously pissed that they couldn&#39;t close early and asked why we were eating so late, telling us to order faster, etc etc. while we were there

Look I understand that wait staff are underpaid, overworked, etc, and I sympathize. All I want is to get my order delivered to my table without feeling like I am being treated like shit. We see the same wait staff every time we go to Mapo and therefore we know we can consistently expect shitty service. We refuse to go to this restaurant anymore. If you have to eat Mapo&#39;s food order to-go instead. Avoid the wait-staff like the plague."

This is literally the best Asian restaurant in our area, and I would highly recommend visiting. It looks small and unassuming on the outside as it&#39;s near a strip mall, but please visit! The interior is very comfortable and welcoming. 

The host was very nice and polite and even opened the restaurant early for us. It was our first time and we walked in on a whim. 

There was a very nice young gentleman waiting on our party, and he made our experience! He explained any menu questions we had, provided us with prompt and helpful service, and was nothing but polite. 

We tried the panang curry, chop suey, and sesame chicken, and our meals were delicious and HUGE in portion. The leftovers we took home fed each of us for two to three meals after what we are in the restaurant. 
 
We ordered their bo bo appetizer plate and were not disappointed! Or server brought it out with a little mini fire to keep our food warm and to have a hands on experience I definitely enjoyed. It came with beef on a stick, BBQ pork, fried shrimp, and crab Rangoon, and egg rolls. It feeds two but three of us shared very comfortably. So good!

I ordered the panang curry medium and it was just the right amount of heat, and I ordered with a combination of meat and only paid about $10-$11 - for a total of four meals from this one plate! It comes with delicious mushrooms, carrots, and pea pods, a sauce, and your choice of meat. 

When we paid for our meal and thanked the host, he asked if we ever tried their smoothies. As it was our first time, we said no. This kind and generous host then prepared a mango strawberry smoothie for us to take on the road, for free! The ingredients are fresh and it is something you need to try!"

Prices are rising, some portions are shrinking and some quality decreasing.  Our orders are typically accurate, hot and delivered timely and the food is tasty.  

At the same time, the issues are fixable!  If the egg rolls get any smaller they will just be shell &amp; no filling.  Same with the beef on a stick - the beef isn&#39;t much bigger than the stick!  Offer two sizes at different price points.  This way we can still get the former full versions if we opt to pay a fair price.  Similarly, the free chicken fried rice has reeled many customers in since the beginning but it has become chickenless.  Once I ordered an actual order of chicken fried rice &amp; got the free one.  Comparably, they seemed to be two different batches entirely.  

Chinese Entrees are usually great! We haven&#39;t tried the other menus much.  One suggested way to cut some cost might be to decrease the amount of white rice per meal.  We always have one untouched large carton, if not more, left after the entrees are gone.  We also never use a good amount of the packaged sauces (soy or orange stuff).  Maybe asking customers if they want it or not could help cut costs on wasted items so some flagship food items can reap the benefit instead!  

Just want to see you great again! PS: the homemade hot mustard is the best!!!"

Sometimes the food is amazing, other times not so much. On a good day the lobster tail and shrimp is tender, juicy and delicious. On a bad day its like rubber. Maybe because we always order for delivery.

They do deliver really fast and that&#39;s a plus. We usually spend about $80 per order for 2 hibachi dinners, crab Rangoon and sometimes pot stickers.

Luckily Tai San is no more than a ten minute drive from her. The three star review is based upon our most recent visit which just so happened to be last night. 

Usually I like to order the Chinese dishes from here but I decided to go out on a whim and try one of their thai dishes since I love Thai food. Let me just begin by saying that I made a  huge mistake. I ordered Pad Thai, the lady friend Mongolian Beef (which I&#39;ve had in the past and is absolutely delicious). She also ordered some Crab Rangoons.  My Pad Thai was nowhere near close to the Pad Thai I&#39;m used to from the authentic Thai places around my house (I live in the Glenview/Northbrook area). It came with a disgusting looking almost neon orange sauce which tasted spicy and sour. Those were the only two flavors I could taste. The dish had none of the layers of flavor I&#39;m used to in Thai food. I ended up finishing no more than a few bites of my huge portion and threw the rest away because it was so bad. The few bites I had of the girlfriend&#39;s Mongolian Beef though, were delicious and did not disappoint. 

One other gripe that I had was that the quality of food does not justify the 30 dollar price tag I paid for the meal. I don&#39;t know the Downers Grove/Woodridge/Darien areas all that well but I&#39;m sure there are other Chinese and/or Thai restaurants that blow this place out of the water. I don&#39;t see us being back any time soon but if we do, I just won&#39;t make the mistake of ordering anything from their Thai menu. In my opinion this place should stick to Chinese food and Chinese food only because as other reviews have noted, you can&#39;t be good at everything."

The lunch chicken hibachi special is 9 dollars and comes w soup, fried rice, and veggies, and is plenty of food, especially for 9 dollars. Gotta say though, the flavor of the hibachi food, while OK, definitely isn&#39;t as good as the expensive hibachi joints in the city. Not that it&#39;s bland, it&#39;s just...ok. The steak and shrimp hibachi lunch specials are all several bucks more for the same amount of food, and while they are decent they&#39;re (to me) not worth increasing cost by 60%. 
I have had their sushi several times and enjoy it. I&#39;m no sushi pro so I stick to the conventional rolls, but hey, I know what I like and I like those.
Beer and sake available, they have cocktails hut I&#39;ve never tried them.
Hibachi show is quite animated, WAY better than the hibachi place I used to go to. The show is definitely fun and the chefs are good at it. No hibachi Mon and Tue though!

We asked the waiter to warm it up in the microwave and came back with it in a couple of minutes. Our eggroll came and could tell it was the frozen kind. My spouse ordered chicken pad Thai and omg. We should have read the review first before we ordered. The pad Thai tasted like Chinese except the noodles part. The chicken was somewhat ok but just didn&#39;t fit the taste. Mine was beef basil and tasted a lot like Chinese with thick sauce instead of the usual soy sauce with a thingy basil taste. I could not even taste the basil leaves as it was drowning with the thick sauce that they use for Chinese dishes.  This was really the most frustrating and most disappointing Thai dinner we ever had and never thought possible.  Our waiter was very nice and attentive so service was good.

I tried a variety of dishes and items and was in general happy with what I received.

The eggdrop soup (with corn) and hot and sour soups were a little above average. There was a little more care than normal put into the preparation but didn&#39;t make a strong impression.

The smoothies were surprisingly good. Few places outside of Chinatown get a good mix of flavor without being excessively sweet. The biggest surprise was that the tapioca (boba) was both soft and properly separated. Many places outside of Chinatown tend to freeze the boba instead of preparing it fresh, resulting in suboptimal texture and clumping.

The beef chow fun was probably the best dish with thick rice noodles that were fried to be very crispy. This was paired with tasty, tender beef.

The crispy duck was prepared exactly as advertised -- crispy. Like the beef chow fun, I felt like I was eating Chinese junk food (but it tasted so good I couldn&#39;t tell myself to stop).

The Szechuan string beans were also a solid choice with good flavor and texture.

The item I was disappointed by was the shrimp pad thai. It was prepared in a almost Hong Kong style tomato sauce and didn&#39;t taste bad, but I was hoping for a contrast in flavor.

Overall, a solid choice if you&#39;re in the area or you want a bit different flavor from the cuisine you get in Chinatown."

The food is always satisfying and the portions are always generous. But goddamn does the service just lack EVERY TIME. The waitresses always have to be called over whether I need a refill on my drink, or need to order, ask for hot sauce, or get the bill... whatever it is, I&#39;m always waving people down. I&#39;ve also noticed (I don&#39;t know how this is possible but I swear to God it&#39;s true) that the waitress always eats her lunch or takes her break in the middle of her shift while serving us. It doesn&#39;t matter what waitress we get, when I&#39;m ready for the bill or ready to order and look around, she will be right there at the back of the restaurant eating. I&#39;m all about people getting their break but if you&#39;re going to go on break, how about telling another waitress to take watch of your table. Today I had to get up and go over to the sushi side to get chopsticks and a soy tray myself so I wouldn&#39;t disturb this girls lunch. Not only that, she took so long to come get the bill that I just walked it up to the register to pay myself as well. These things aren&#39;t deal breakers and I&#39;m sure we will be back but just something to think about Thai San Chef. Let&#39;s get these waitresses under some kind of training program."

Before I go any further, I have to say that for me the saving grace of this place is their fresh fruit smoothies that are on par with Joy Yee.  

They offer some good lunch specials and also have Japanese, Thai and Chinese cuisine all conveniently in one location.  It usually scares me when a restaurant claims to be able to make foods from three different places, and my instinct was not that far off in this instance.  I mean, you can&#39;t be good at all three.  It just isn&#39;t possible and personally I think they should cross Japanese off the list.  

I ordered the lunch special of a spicy salmon roll and a couple of pieces of salmon sushi.  I also got a specialty roll, the Red Dragon to try something else.  My lunch came with a bowl of miso soup which was probably my favorite food item.  My spicy salmon roll and the Red Dragon which were supposed to be spicy weren&#39;t.  In fact all of the sushi lacked flavor overall.  I wondered if maybe the fish wasn&#39;t fresh and that is why the food lacked flavor.  The only thing that I could taste were the cucumbers inside the roll and the sauce on top of it.  

The service was good, the waitress was eager to please.  I do wish that when I had ordered my smoothie that she had asked me if I wanted tapioca in it.  I figured it was obvious that I did, but when she brought it to me it was missing those delicious little balls - but that was my fault for not ordering it correctly.  Because this place is so close and because of the great smoothies I will be back, but I will probably try Chinese food next time."

But I don&#39;t blame Tai San Chef, or their 20 page menu of Chinese, Japanese, and Thai creations. I blame my gluttonous habits and the broken switch in my head that should be saying &#34;Stop eating, Stupid!&#34;

Overall, the food was aight, yo. I could probably go a 3 star but their portion sizes are no joke, I really liked my veggie soup, and the place is unassumingly large and WAY cuter than I had expected inside. 

A few notables~

 -Their first menu page shows a bunch of photos of bubble tea and has a flavor list but says &#39;smoothies&#39;. Just to be sure, I asked my server guy and he said they don&#39;t have bubble tea, only smoothies... Bummer! Until I see a table across the way who clearly has bubble tea. I assume he made a mistake and I decided to just say the flavor I want while pointing to the bubble tea on the menu and just hoping I got what I wanted. What did I get? A plain ole frickin&#39; smoothie. LAME! What&#39;s a girl gotta do to get some boba around here?

-My Spicy Basil Leaves and tofu dish wasn&#39;t very spicy and it had that super thick syrup-y sauce I&#39;ve found to be indicative of Chinese food restaurants who try to add in some Thai tastes. To me, it&#39;s just too heavy and you don&#39;t get to taste the veggies the way you would if it were the thinner Thai chili sauce. 

-My fortune cookie arrived broken. :(

-Free (and delicious) almond cookie at the end

-The place was PACKED at 6:00 on Wednesday evening

-Service can run a bit behind but it appeared as if just one young guy was serving all 15 tables in the area where I was sitting. NOT an easy feat. Keep this in mind and tip well- that boy busts his ass. 

-Like I said earlier, the veggie soup was delish!

-The spring roll order was HUGE and though not very flavorful, I did still enjoy it as a filler. 

I would go back to try their hibachi, sushi, or the super cheap Mai Tais I&#39;ve heard about, but I think I&#39;d stay away from the Thai food as it doesn&#39;t seem to be their specialty."

The staff were not clearing the tables so there was a long wait to be seated.  When we finally were seated, the large table next to us was still full of dirty plates and half-eaten food by the last customers, I could actually smell it.  and...it stayed that way for a good 45 minutes, as did other tables in the dining room.  This kind of ruined our entire dining experience.   Mind you, I had told Dan what a great place this was, so I felt bad for even taking him here.   I had never had an issue before with Tai San Chef, and previously liked the food.  But after this visit, in the morning I woke with a huge migraine so I&#39;m wondering now if their food doesn&#39;t have MSG.  Not sure I&#39;ll come back to this place."

The wife and I agreed:  let&#39;s do take out Chinese. 

We ordered up the following:

Beef and brocolli - Standard B&amp;B, tasty, meat was tender, brocolli was fresh.
Szechwan string beans - Unfortunately not spicey at all... beans and pork were friend nicely, but not a hint of spice.  
Yu Shang Eggplant - The egg plant was more soggy than crisp (may just be how they serve it here...) but more importantly, it really wasn&#39;t spicy at all!  My expectation of eating food is that if there&#39;s a red pepper next to it on the menu, I want some burn!
Beef Chow Fun - Actually quite tasty!  The noodles were soft with some pull, and the beef was tender and enjoyable.

And since we were over $50, they threw in a very large chicken fried rice.

This served as three meals between the two of us, and snacks for a bit as well.  Which goes to show how large portion sizes are here!

Verdict:  huge quantities, good food, but the spice levels were terrible.  I may give it another chance but order the food extra spicey instead... I kept waiting for the spice to hit, but there was just no kick!  And thus the three stars... we may be back to try again."

I had an order of Tom Kha Gai (listed on the menu as chicken coconut soup) and it was below average at best. Chicken was an odd texture and the soup was missing flavors.

Me and my friend met up here for lunch as the reviews are pretty good. It was crowded when we got in and had to wait for about 5 minutes before was seated. We thought that was a good sign. 

We looked up the long menu and then got our usual order of  Thai food: Chicken Pad Thai (lunch special) for her and Red curry with Shrimp for me. 

The Egg roll was huge with thick wrapper. It tasted OK. Pad Thai arrived first and came with Fried rice. Not type of Pad Thai she liked. A bit mushy with no much flavor. Fried rice was just OK.

 Red curry was served with chicken. I didn&#39;t realized it till I took one bite. Well chicken didn&#39;t taste good and curry sauce was too salty. I told the waiter that it was wrong dish. He said I ordered Chicken. My friend confirmed that I ordered Shrimp. He did cooked another red curry with Shrimp for me which tasted better but still too much salty and not enough sugar and coconut milk.

I think i might have the better chance with the Chinese food here instead of Thai. I have nothing against Chinese Chef cooking Thai food or Mexican chef cooking Chinese food but the dish has to taste good. 

I guess I&#39;m picky as a gentleman next to me told the waiter that his food was excellent and asked the waiter to send the compliment to the chef. So there are people love their food. It is just not my type."

First dish, first stop, China and some Cucumber salad. It was just cucumber and juice. I normally have this and there is a little more to it than just a cucumber in a sweet sauce.

Second dish, quick jump to Japan, the sushi was OK flavor-wise but fell apart with the touch of the chop stick.

Main dish and a stop in Thailand for some panang curry and pad thai. I wish I could remember these more but the panang was rockin&#39; good, like the only food item we would order again if we come back here... but the pad thai, large, large, large disappointment with its lack of flavor.

Finally, the reason we stayed through the mediocre dish after dish... $4 Mai Tai drink special. These are totally worth you dropping a $20 on drinks alone.

I had the Tai San spring roll which was deep fried and okay. I got the thai coconut hot and sour soup with shrimp. All spice yet no flavor. The panang curry was nothing to write home about. Again all spice which I love yet lacked flavor of Panang. People I talked to in line said they mostly order chinese from them and had never had thai food. I know better now. Oh and the crab rangoon was okay. Anywho...I will return and order Chinese. I hope it lives up to my standard. The place is a nice size and bright.

I guess we weren&#39;t the only ones with that idea.

Service was good, albeit a little slow. There were Mai-Tais on special for 3.95$ and they even have ramune in a bottle. Score! Prices for the hibachi food are a little high, but it is worth it. I had the calamari, scallop and shrimp combo for 24.95 and it was awesome. They certainly don&#39;t skimp on anything either. Plenty of seafood, more than enough fried rice and veggies galore. I probably should have taken some home, but what would be the fun in that?

Warning for parents though, make sure your kid can handle the flames. From what my 3 year old boy told me, the flames were scary and the man was too loud. I thought it would be fun for him, but what do I know?

For 4 adults to eat and have one alcoholic beverage plus a kids hibachi chicken (which was delicious by the way) the tab was only 140$ Not bad and totally worth it."

Service was a bit slow. Waited ten minutes for anyone to acknowledge us after being seated. Started off with some Egg Drop Soup, which was extremely hot, but fair. Ordered the &#34;Lunch Special&#34; Shrimp Broccoli with Chicken Fried Rice from the Chinese menu (they offer Chinese, Japanese,  &amp; Thai) and the Shrimp Tempura Roll from the Japanese. Prices were all reasonable ($5.99) for the Shrimp Vegetable Lunch. Once served, realized our lunch today was going to be.... &#34;ehhh&#34;. The chicken fried rice was dry and flavorless. My shrimp broccoli was extremely hot (fresh out of the micro), and also had very little going for it in the flavor department. I ordered my dish spicy as well, which the apparently forgot to mention to the chef. My wife&#39;s entree, Cashew Shrimp, had a little bit more going for it, but the same dry rice, and average taste seemed to be the theme with our meals. Towards the end of our lunch we finally received our Shrimp Roll. 5 pieces. Noticed right away the lack of shrimp and overabundance of celery. Ehhhhh. The flavor matched its boring appearance. Lack of flavor, lack of shrimp, and the shrimp tail being left on and hidden inside one of the rolls, drove the dish straight into the ground. Luckily, some chile oil rescued what could be saved from our lunch. 

Long story short, go somewhere else. Unless you&#39;re in a pinch, low on funds, or don&#39;t have wheels drive, spend your time and money elsewhere."

I love the technicolor pad thai; it has been my favorite item since first dining here years ago! Say what you will about my palette or taste - I love it.

Their delivery area is seemingly endless and the prices are good for the amount of food you get. You can also order take-out at the register and it is ready in 15 minutes. The menu is large and has grown to incorporate Japanese, which I unfortunately have not made the effort to try.

I have absolutely nothing bad to say about Thai San and wish them only success. They had me the first time I dined-in and heard piano renditions of contemporary billboard hits playing softly as background music... I can only hope that is still the music of choice."

- Good cuts of meat used for beef dishes, which I appreciate.
- Crab rangoon is delicious. (Someone said it tasted sweet?  I have never noticed that.)
- Good hot &amp; sour soup for sick days
- Kung Pao is very good, and recently seems to have gotten spicier (or I&#39;ve gotten wussier)
- BBQ pork appetizer is tasty, although sweet

Owners are very nice people.  Sushi is average, and I&#39;m not a fan of Thai food, so I can&#39;t comment on that.  But I&#39;m happy to give these people my business, as I have yet to be dissatisfied with an experience dining in, taking out, or getting delivery."

Not sure what has happened to this place between my last review when I gave it a 4 stars to current but the quality of food at this place have DEFINITELY went down. 

The last time I was there, we ordered a Thai Sour soup and it was the worse thing I&#39;ve ever seen presented for almost $6.  It was basically water, with raw humongous pieces of veggies floating on top.  The mushrooms looked like it just came out of packaging the length of your thumb.  The tomatoes were cut just as big.  I can&#39;t believe how they would expect to charge a premium for this soup.  Plus, it tasted nothing like Thai soup; in fact, it tasted like they just dumped seasoning and mixed it in for 5 minutes and served. So we asked the waitress if the soup was suppose to taste like this, and when she said &#34;yes!&#34;, we sent it back.  She wasn&#39;t nice about it or seem apologetic at all. 

My other dish was the Pad-See Eww and the noodles came out black and burnt.  As first I thought it&#39;s OK if it&#39;s just a few burnt strands but half of my dish was burnt.  They also put the same white mushrooms like the ones from my soup into this noodle dish (whoever heard of mushrooms in your pad see eww?).  But while the noodles were burnt, the mushroom was raw. 

So final score: it was a mistake and this place will never have my patronage again. Why? Because both the food&#39;s quality have come down to a bare minimum and that their service isn&#39;t really up to par for the price that they charge. 

I would have given it 2 stars but the indifferent and ill-mannered customer service just didn&#39;t leave me with a good taste in my mouth, literally. 

========
The sushi maki seems alright but nothing too special or set apart from the ones you get in a box at a grocery store.  Their Thai dish are not too bad, particularly the Pad See Ew.  Their Thai curry dishes is alright too but could use more flavor and coconut intensity.  

I was a little disappointed in the bubble tea because it didn&#39;t taste like they used fresh fruits but powder instead.  The bubble themselves were too soft and not chewy.  But the bubble tea is a pretty cheap (under $3) so in that sense, you can&#39;t expect Joy Yee&#39;s standards."

Tai San Chef was introduced to me by my co-workers. Now, I work in an area that has not one, but TWO Asian restaurants within walking distance, however, I noticed that the girls always ordered from the place that was a few minutes away. When I finally tried them, I was impressed!

Over the past few months, I&#39;ve ordered Curry Fried Rice, Thai Spring Rolls, Red Curry Vegetables and Tofu, and Spicy Pineapple Fried Rice and they&#39;ve all been delicious! 

Did I mention fresh fruit smoothies?? Yes, I like to order mine without sweetener (actual phone conversation: &#34;No sweetener?&#34; &#34;Right, I don&#39;t  want any sugar or sweetener added.&#34;) I love that he verified it with me while I placed my order! That&#39;s another great point, I&#39;ve never had an order messed up,  and I&#39;m notorious for having special requests and substitutions.

They get major points in my book for being open Mondays, which is a notoriously bad day to have a craving for Asian food (most places are closed.) Anytime I&#39;m at work or placing an order to take some food home after work on Mondays, I&#39;ll be calling Tai San Chef for sure."

Not the best I had. What can I say? It&#39;s not &#39;real&#39; Chinese food. Maybe I just chose the wrong stuff from the menu. 
Maybe I&#34;ll give this place another try. 

Haven&#39;t tried the Thai food so I can&#39;t comment on that. (Maybe I&#34;ll try that next time) 

I tried the sushi. The rice is hard, and the sushi falls apart easily.

The would have really wanted to possibly give this place 3 stars..But I just couldn&#39;t. The reason is because of their service. There&#39;s this waiter that is  rude. It just seems like he hates his job, &amp; does&#39;t really give a crap. So next time I&#39;ll ask for the waitress instead.

My guess is that this place is owned by Chinese or Koreans.  Sushi sucks just falls apart and fish is not that great.  For the love of god stay away from the Pad Thai.  It comes technicolor orange from that disgusting canned sauce and rubber noodles.  You can make WAY better at home and I don&#39;t care who you are.  So once you get rid of the Thai and Japanese what you&#39;re left with is mediocre at best Chinese.  Crab Rangoon if filled with disgustingly sweet filling probably frozen.  I&#39;ve tried this place three separate times hoping that I&#39;m wrong.  The best thing I&#39;ve had is the red curry.  It&#39;s really mongolian beef with a little coconut milk.  Not even red in color but not bad tasting.  Best Thai in Western Burbs in Bambu Thai in Elmhurst.  Thai O&#39;Choa in Darien is pretty good too.

When Tai San Chef opened a few years back, I was skeptical because I had yet to find a Chinese restaurant that was up to par in my area.  Upon trying their food the first time, I was thrilled. I like my Kung Pao Chicken not warm, but hot, and they made it HOT per my request! Their beef and mushroom, Mongolian chicken, and Hunan chicken are all excellent, with lots of flavor.  The veggies they use are very fresh; too often, Chinese restaurants use mushy, bland veggies, but that has never happened to me at this place. I also love their egg rolls--they are never greasy or soggy. The egg drop soup is good, but my favorite soup is sizzling rice soup. It&#39;s delicious.

The staff have always been friendly when I&#39;ve dined there. For takeout, they have never once messed up my orders, even when I made substitutions or had a special request. Their smoothies are also awesome.

I can&#39;t speak for sushi or the Thai food as I&#39;m not a fan, but we have tried the Hibachi and everything we ordered was very good.

Their food in general seems a bit too greasy or just not very flavorful to me.  Their Pad Thai is doused in a sweet and sour type of sauce that is just absolute overkill.  Their thai curries are too watery and lack flavor.  I once ordered one of their lunch specials for takeout, which included the entree along with fried rice and an eggroll and the bag was literally dripping with grease by the time I got it back to my office.

One thing I will mention, the service is really quick.  Whenever I&#39;ve gone in to eat  the food was out to me within 10 mins or less, also they serve you hot tea which is pretty good.  Hold on to your plates though, the wait staff is more than eager to take it away from you even with food still left on the plate.  I probably wouldn&#39;t go to this place if it wasn&#39;t so convenient with regard to where I work and the time I have to fit in lunch.

If you come here for lunch, you get a great deal with a good dish, an egg roll and your choice of soup - I recommend the egg drop soup.  You can also ask for tea with your meal and they will give it to you for free.

The service here has gone downhill over the past year or two.  Every once in a while this place will overhaul its server personnel and their current staff no longer measures up to their old staff.

The food is still good if you like the standard brown-sauce Chinese dishes.  If you like orange chicken, I recommend the General Tso&#39;s chicken (same sauce, better vegetables).

This place is really good.  Had the Shrimp Pod See Ew and it was awesome. I&#39;m not going to lie this place could be up to par w/ my fav. place for Chinese food in the burbs, Chi Tung. The only thing I noticed that was right from the other reviews was that the noodles were kind of burnt however not completely and honestly the food still tasted very good.  I can also confirm that they use real fruit in their smoothies. I know this because they made it for me when I came to pick up my order.  I will definitely be coming back and trying other things because Darien is a heck of a lot closer than Evergreen Park (Chi Tung) and Chinatown.  One other thing, the prices are good here (similar to most mom and pop chinatown establishments where the prices are low). In addition to Chinese they also serve Japanese, Thai, and Sushi making it a one stop shop!"

My sandwich, the Orange Cranberry Club, was like the best parts of Thanksgiving in the middle of summer.  Delicious.  For a side I went with mac and cheese, and while a random choice, was also fantastic.  On our way out I felt compelled to buy a chocolate chip cookie.

I had already decided on a Reuben before I arrived. A good benchmark for me and I was pleasantly satisfied with my to-go order once I got home. The bread could have been toasted a bit more, but the very lean flavorful corned beef is what I was after. Just the right amount of sauerkraut and dressing. I hate it when other delis try to impress you with 2&#34; of sauerkraut. A great tasting pickle wedge too.

When I was standing in line I was asked what drink I would like and that was brought out before my order was even taken. They have one size... Thirsty-two!

I didn&#39;t realize the sandwich came with a side and at a very reasonable price. I went with their mac n cheese, but was too full to eat it. It should nuke up nicely.

The fillings were fresh, the ham with the turkey and bacon was very good combination. I was not happy with their choice of bread. The bread was the typical square, store bought, value, wheat bread. I was expecting a nice grain wheat or choice of wheat. Cole slaw was very good, not too creamy.

Been meaning to check it out since there are locations near my home &amp; near work.  Hankering for something new for lunch, I decided today was the day to check it out.  

Walked in &amp; it&#39;s a nicely decorated place with video menu boards ala Standard Market and a fancier Panera.  There are a ton of samiches &amp; sides to choose from.  They are known for their clubs so I opted for their chicken club with pasta salad &amp; a large fountain pop.  Total came to nearly $10, which I expected walking in.  They gave me my number, told me to take a seat &amp; my samich &amp; side would be out shortly.   

The samich came out quartered and wasn&#39;t very big at all.  Not quite what I had envisioned in my head, especially at the cost.   It was a club sandwich, but the bread was very thin &amp; there was hardly any meat in it.  Their honey mustard sauce is one of their big draws and while I liked it, I didn&#39;t think it was all that.  The samich by itself, albeit disappointing was good, not great.  The pasta salad was good.  I did leave there still feeling hungry.   My friend ordered half a reuben and half a potato with bacon &amp; cheese. The tater was huge and looked awesome.   Next time, I think I&#39;d try a different samich and a stuffed tater of some sort. 

All in all, I liked the place but I don&#39;t love it. It&#39;s clean, service was great, food was good but for my $10, there are far more satisfactory and filling samich places in the area."

The menus are digital, large and includes pictures so they are easy to read. There was a line of about 4 or 5 people ahead of us so that gave us first timers a chance to look through the menu. The line went surprisingly fast and we still did not have our orders when it was our turn. I settled on the club and my dining companion had the Italian. I loved that they offer many different sides for no extra charge, like mac and cheese. Usually restaurants will charge extra but McAlister&#39;s does not. My club was very good. It definitely wasnt the best club I have ever had but still a very good meal. It was a bit smaller than I thought it would be. The honey mustard had a bit of twang that I am not sure I liked. The mac and cheese was decent as well. The Italian came out as a hot sandwich, which was surprising. I had a bite and it was very good as well, but thought it might be better as a cold sandwich. Messy sandwich as well but we were sitting near where they kept the napkins.

One thing we really appriciated from the store were the many people walking around offering to get refills of drinks or bringing extra napkins. The manager noticed that we were picking things off the Italian and offered to remake the sandwich, without the red peppers. We refused but it was a nice gesture. 

We do plan on coming back and navigating through the menu. Two thumbs up!"

I had the New Yorker with a side of potato salad and she had the Memphian with the macaroni and cheese. 
The sandwiches were very delicious and the sides were too! The only thing I would like is a little bit of a bigger sandwich for the price. There is a Fontanos a few doors down that has amazing deli style sandwiches which are much more generous portions.

I&#39;ve been here twice now, both times to go, but will definitely be back to eat inside too. I heard they are opening a drive-thru soon, which I will be taking full advantage of. Cleanliness and customer service are clearly major priorities here! And the food is delicious! The atmosphere is similar to a Panera, but brighter and less chaotic. Although I only ordered to go, I saw how it would be to dine in. You order at the counter where they have a beautiful digital screen overhead with many choices. Then they bring your food to your table, and clean up after you too! The staff was very attentive to everyone I saw, offering to get anything they needed like in a sit-down restaurant, but less formal and no real wait staff, just workers offering assistance to anyone who needed it.  They were constantly making sure everything was clean and organized. While I waited for my food, which only took a few minutes even though it was quite busy, two different members of the staff asked if I needed anything and genuinely seemed to want to make sure everyone was happy. 

Now, for the food, I have to say it is absolutely delicious!  It may seem pricey at first, but the quality is much better than any other sandwich or soup place that charges the same or more. The bread is fresh and tastes like homemade. I had the roast beef &amp; horseradish grilled sandwich (with awesome grilled onions), which was so good I craved it and had to go back later that week to get it again.  My mom had a turkey sandwich and said how good it was even though she generally doesn&#39;t care much for sandwiches. My husband had the grilled chicken and although he didn&#39;t realize it came on a croissant, said it was very good.  He also suggested we get the ultimate nachos. I was skeptical because it&#39;s a sandwich place and how good can their nachos really be? Well, the answer is really freaking good. The nacho cheese had chili in it to my delight, and the toppings were fresh and plentiful. Best nachos I&#39;ve had in a while with tons of toppings. Also, the mac &amp; cheese was an awesome side - I got it for my daughter, and kept stealing bites even though I usually don&#39;t like mac &amp; cheese much. Also, I loved the squash soup in a bread bowl! It was a bit sweet and very good!  I was told it&#39;s seasonal, so not sure what other soups they&#39;ll be getting in, but can&#39;t wait to try them! The only things we didn&#39;t care for were the mashed potatoes - those tasted too commercial and not at all homemade. The steamed veggies could have been steamed longer too as the carrots were basically raw and too hard for my liking. But overall, they do a really good job of offering a variety of quality food. 

Finally, I really like that they want to ensure you have the correct order before you take it to go. One of the guys from the back brought it on a tray and transferred it to a bag as he checked off every item in front of me. The nachos were disassembled and the ingredients were in individual containers so everything would keep and you wouldn&#39;t end up with soggy chips and hot sour cream.  Very nice touch. Same with the bread bowl. The soup came in a separate container. Wish they offered potato wedges or some sort of fries, but that&#39;s just me being nitpicky. 

I really think that for the quality and customer service, this place is top notch and the food is worth every penny.  They genuinely seem to care and they either hire those with the same work ethic, or train them well as everyone was super nice and competent. Great experience and can&#39;t wait until the drive-thru opens in a week or so! What a great addition to the area!"

I am a big fan of sandwiches and I have frequented all of the establishments within mere steps of this new deli.  Some are fancier than others, but when it comes down to it, the quality of the food is what brings me back time and again.

McAlister&#39;s Deli has all of the right window dressing, a beautiful new building located at a busy corner of 95th Street and Route 59, and a lovely dining area.  The entire parking area around the restaurant was very full, not just when I went, but also during the entire week as I drove past multiple times.  They certainly are having a successful grand opening promotion!

I was met with multiple smiley faces and energetic employees.  Awesome!  This place definitely has a nice feel good vibe to it!  Similar to Noodles, they serve everything on real dishware, not plastic or paper.  

My group ordered 3 sandwiches with sides to split and try.  Our unanimous thoughts about the food are these:
1)  Everything was very eye-appealing, the food looks just like the photos, no kidding!  So a big A+ to the cooks/sandwich makers in this area.
2)  The sandwiches were extremely original and different then your &#34;basic&#34; ham or turkey.  They do serve those, but we wanted to take it a step further and try some unique items:  French Dip, Orange Cranberry Club, and New Yorker.  We thought there were definitely many choices!  However we felt that the New Yorker &amp; Orange Cranberry Club were a bit on the salty side.  The meat itself in the French Dip was delicious, but the sandwich was a bit small and the au jus was bland.  
3)  The breads were of a variety, we didn&#39;t make any substitutions and ordered them as presented on the menu.  However, they were all a bit on the &#34;light&#34; side, not having the wholesomeness and aroma that I expect at this price point.  
4)  The sides of Mashed Potatoes, Mac &amp; Cheese, and Potato Salad were large portions.  However, we agreed that they needed more flavor, tasting less homemade and more pre-prepped.  

Overall, I feel that the McAlister&#39;s brand has large shoes to fill being new and located in a very competitive area.  The price point for this restaurant is comparable to other sandwich shops within walking distance, fancier than some, but the size and quality of the sandwiches and sides would need to be better for me to really become a fan.  

In all fairness, since this is the first week of business, I will wait awhile and try again in the future.  I&#39;m hopeful that they will impress me &amp; I will more than happily give them a higher rating!"

As a born and bred New Yorker I take offense to the term deli even being used in the title of this eatery. This place is more along the lines of a Panera but food quality is much lower. They offer sandwiches, salads, soup and baked potatoes. I ordered the nacho appetizer and chicken tortilla soup. The appetizer was a plate of low grade tortilla chips with a cup of oily cheese that looked and smelled like Velveeta. That&#39;s it for $7. The soup had no chicken in it I could see as I spooned through it. I ate one spoonful and couldn&#39;t believe how much it looked and tasted like the cheese sauce served with the nacho plate along with the same layer of oily residue on surface. I only ate one spoon of the soup however as I found a long black hair in the soup. I brought this to the attention of the assistant manager quietly and respectfully, she walked the bowl back to the kitchen where one of the workers looked at the hair and then said loudly &#34;she&#39;s complaining over that little hair?&#34; Then gave me an evil stare like I was overreacting! I asked what the size of the hair had to do with anything? The assistant manager was highly embarrassed over the kitchen workers reaction and said she&#39;d &#34;talk to her later&#34; I did at least get my $6 back for the bowl of soup. 
My husband had the roast beef and horseradish sandwich. His remarks &#34;bread is poor quality, cold cuts are on par with Subway, i.e. Highly processed and no flavor&#34; His sandwich was almost $10. The ice tea was good and tasted freshly brewed but that doesn&#39;t make up for the overpriced low quality food and rude staff. We will never return and several friends have asked us our take on this place knowing we are from New York and know what a real deli is like and we&#39;ve directed them to avoid this place at all costs. As a side note the assistant manager couldn&#39;t figure out how to process my refund for the &#34;soup with hair&#34; and was waiting for the head manager for direction. He was on the phone having a loud and apologetic conversation with a person who apparently had their catering order screwed up. She waited and waited to get his attention and finally just opened the register and handed me cash back even though I initially paid with a debit card. So apparently I was not the only disappointed patron that day."

They have lots of good selections for different types of sandwiches and soups, and everything I&#39;ve ordered there has been really good. The place was very crowded at 1:30 PM on a Saturday, so that usually means that they&#39;re pretty good.

I ordered a New Yorker (pastrami and corned beef on toasted rye with brown mustard) and my wife ordered a Reuben. The quality of the meat was on par with Arby&#39;s. $21 for two sandwiches and it tasted like that pressed loaf stuff you get at an Arby&#39;s or corporate building deli in the basement of a high rise office building. Quality of the base food product is pretty poor. In a town that is home to Vienna Beef, I can&#39;t believe they couldn&#39;t serve better product. We didn&#39;t try any of the other menu items, like soups or salads, but my mark for a good deli is how they do a pastrami or corned beef sandwich.

I shared tiramisu with my friend, hands down best I&#39;ve ever had - and I looove tiramisu. They corked our unfinished bottle to take home too.

However, the 2 and 3-star reviews are accurate.  We had a reservation and were seated promptly, but the service was not good.  Our server was fine, but he was sweaty, red, and flustered.  He did his best.  Although every table in the house was full, I didn&#39;t see too many different waiters present.  I thought that maybe they were understaffed, but the lack of service appears to be a trend when reading other reviews.

We started the meal, or tried to start the meal, with complimentary bread with oil and cheese.  Our group repeatedly asked for bread and were told &#34;the kitchen is working on it,&#34; and any time something was delivered to our table, they re-iterated how &#34;hot&#34; and &#34;fresh&#34; everything was.  The first basket of bread was warm, but certainly not fresh, and the second basket was hard and cold.

I had the Eggplant Parmesan and was disappointed.  There was no cheese in sight!  The eggplant did have a crispy, and non-greasy, coating, but where were the layers of cheese and sauce? 

There&#39;s a Yelp check-in deal for a free bruschetta app.  That was good.  But have you ever had bad bruschetta?  Me either.  It isn&#39;t worth a return visit.

Nope."

I love the big, tall windows and large rounded corner of the restaurant. It brings in so much light, and dining there makes you feel like a royal. 

I came with a party of 8 and the server was very accommodating. He was checking up on us frequently, and was very polite and professional. 

For an appetizer, I would highly recommend the portebello mushroom. It came out hot and fresh with a wonderful vodka sauce, spimach, and shrimp! Flavor combination just screamed Italian. We also got the bruschetta which had some good fresh tomatos, but would have been better with some balsamic vinegar. 

I can recommend the Caeser salad and the vodka pasta. The itallian sausage and meatballs were good as well! The only thing that looked kind of meh that the whole party got was scallops &amp; marinara dish. It just looked like there wasn&#39;t enough sauce, and the scallops were medium-sized and not big and fat.

One last thing that gives Capri a big plus is the wine menu. Plenty of selection (as big as the food menu), and lots of greater Italian makers.

I would definetly recommend going to Capri; afterwards, explore downtown Downers Grove!"

I didn&#39;t enjoy the seating at all.

The waiter brought out bread for us and they only had oil on the table for dipping, no vinegar. 

I ordered the spicy shrimp linguini and it came with a small salad. The linguini itself was good but nothing too spectacular. 

Service was a bit slow and I think they were understaffed because my waiter seemed exhausted running around. Parking can be easily found in the structure about a block down or there is also a lot of street parking.

Ambiance was a bit more classy than a regular Italian restaurant. I was able to have a nice conversation with my friend without having to yell so that was a plus."

Having been given a generous amount of Capri gift cards, we found Eat 24 (online ordering for restaurants) and ordered a meal.  We live just down the street, so my husband picked up quickly.  We ordered some the same dishes that we have had when dining there and they were so skimpy.  Literally a tiny cutlet of veal in one and chicken in another.  The breading was soggy and soaked in a too acrid lemon sauce.  The bread was stale and both salads looked like they had been dumped from a premade bag into the containers.  Never again.  I cannot believe they have lasted in DG this long.  When we have dined in, the service has been inattentive and inconsistent."

I love hanging out in the lounge as it reminds me of a city type of locale with an organic, round dining room.  Katie was working behind the bar my first time and she was very friendly.  The bread they bring out is nice and warm.  Given how much I really enjoy the ambiance and service, I really wish I liked the food more.  The calamari is outstanding.  Even if you order from Capri to go, it is awesome (and it&#39;s hard to transport calamari successfully).  I would highly recommend trying it.  Everything else, is unfortunately just average.  Also their portion sizes are off.  The chicken parm was HUGE.  It is far too large for one person.  Unfortunately while the chicken was tender, it was also bland.  The squid ink pasta itself had a great texture but the seafood in it was overcooked.  Also this portion (picture added) is literally what would be served family style at a wedding.  They give it for one person after bread and a salad.  Overall, wish the food had more flavor but still a decent option, particularly being right across the street from the train."

I know I&#39;m more sensitive to &#34;background&#34; music then anyone I&#39;m hanging around with. But I just have to say...on Saturday, early evening April 4th, what was playing at an obtrusive volume was an album (I presume of) a man and woman making super cheezy duets out of otherwise awesome songs: U2, Coldplay, Snow Patrol, Tracy Chapman...all musically murdered, one after the other. It was dreadful. This REALLY didn&#39;t go with the Frank Sinatra portraits hanging on the walls. I wouldn&#39;t have been surprised at all to see Frank pull a scowl. Why not play Frank, if you&#39;re going for swank? The other 4-5 tables that were full were like my table: Parent or grandparent in their 70s or 80s and their children and grandchildren. Not sure what kind of audience the music was supposed to be pleasing. How about just play Frank? If someone doesn&#39;t like Frank, they SHOULD anyway."

The food is lousy and the &#34;service&#34; is ridiculously bad. So bad in fact that several times the next day, at random, either my husband or I would just blurt out, &#34;wow that was horrible. I mean - I can&#39;t remember the last time I was in a restaurant with service that awful...&#34; etc. If we weren&#39;t there celebrating my husband&#39;s Great Aunt&#39;s 85th birthday and if it were free then we&#39;d probably be able to just laugh it off, but sadly it was her birthday and the prices were anything, but cheap. Especially considering I only received half of my entree (chicken with side of pasta = just a hammered out piece of chicken dripping in a soggy, overly sour lemon sauce). It would take a long time to go through all the bizarre and sometimes rude service-related issues AND tell you how bad the food was, so I&#39;ll just do a &#34;greatest hits&#34; of some  of the more memorable moments from our dinner last weekend:

- All of our meals came with the standard soup or salad option to be brought out before the entree. Before my soup even had a chance to cool down, our entrees started coming out. This is a crowded table too so in addition to the annoyance of having to scarf down your appetizer to avoid your entree from getting cold, the whole stacking plates to find room circus came into play. My husband&#39;s aunt kindly asked if they could hold off on serving the entrees and I swear to everything they just ignored her and kept putting food down. She asked THREE times and the servers (we had several rotating in and out throughout the night) pretended not to hear her before stopping...clearly because they saw themselves that there was no more room. Rather than take everything back, they left a few entrees on the table (including mine) which was incredibly awkward. 

- The food. This is some bland food, folks. The lentil soup was watery, my husband&#39;s chicken/shrimp dish had zero taste and another family member said his dish&#39;s sauce tasted like it was reheated from a can. Mine, as detailed above, was also not good. At all.

- Missing items. As I mentioned earlier, my entree (Pollo Limone) was supposed to come with a side of pasta (as did all of the others) and it didn&#39;t. Drinks were ordered that never came and it took two requests to get the coffees we ordered after dessert. Even more irritating is that we were charged for everything whether it was ever brought to the table or not...which reminds me of the production that was settling our check...

- I know that splitting checks is super annoying. I&#39;ve worked in restaurants. I get it. However, it was four bills and we clearly explained each of the orders, drinks, etc. that went with each check. The fuss that was made over an unclaimed diet coke (that my husband&#39;s uncle ordered but never received) was INSANE. At one point, I&#39;m like - &#34;just throw it on mine if that means we can wrap this up!&#34; but again, ignored. The server then decided to stand over our table to loudly announce that they would not be charging us for the bread. How magnanimous of you, kind establishment, to comp our bread! I don&#39;t know what the purpose of that announcement was because I&#39;ve never been charged for bread that is automatically brought to the table upon sitting down. They also loudly announced, &#34;we are not charging you for one dessert as it&#39;s someone&#39;s birthday.&#34; It was just tacky and silly. When I say announced loudly, I mean - standing over the head of the table and reading through the whole bill for no reason...and wrongly, I might add. She just made up entrees because she couldn&#39;t remember what we actually did order. Needless to say, our checks were still screwed up, but at that point, everyone just wanted to leave.   

I&#39;m sad that we went here and I&#39;m sad that this place exists. Avoid."

The food was excellent but more impressive was the level of service.  Our server Dan (I think) was very passionate about the food preparation, and quick to meet our needs.

Unfortunately, I was disappointed again.  We were given roasted garlic and olives on the table with our bread.  Usually, there is a nice cheese on the plate as well but either they forgot it or are not doing that anymore for costs reasons.  We ordered four appetizer plates to share.  Granted I knew they would be smaller portions, but the fried meatballs in an arrabiata sauce were very small...the size of a quarter and there were only three.  Tasty, but certainly not worth the money.  The arancini were good - three nice-sized portions.  The caprese was good as always.  The prosciutto and melon was very disappointing.  The melon was hard and not ripe at all, no sweetness because it was served before its time.  Needed a knife to cut through this.  The delight of this dish is the sweetness of a juicy melon against the saltiness of the meat.  Such a failure.  The only reason I would come back to this restaurant is if friends suggest it.  Otherwise, I will travel the extra 20 minutes and go the Capri in Burr Ridge.  I always am happy with the quality of food there."

Caesar salads were very good. Entrees were delicious. My husband&#39;s gnocchi looked like little pillows and the texture was incredible. Very creamy, not chewy. The red pepper sauce was sweet and delicious. No complaints about my chicken either. I can&#39;t believe all the negative reviews I&#39;m reading. We haven&#39;t seen that at all. Maybe it&#39;s because we usually go on a weeknight?"

That said, I always enjoy going here and I find the menu to be absolutely delightful. In terms of food preparation, it reminds me a little more of what I find when I&#39;ve been in Italy in the past, compared to some of the more Americanized options in the area. 

The vitello limone is probably my favorite offering on this menu - I like lemon (citrus in general) but if someone isn&#39;t a fan, then definitely skip on this item. The mussels and linguini is fantastic, but if someone is looking for a straight pasta dish, I would always recommend the porcini mushroom sacchetti. 

It is a pricier option for the downtown restaurants, but the atmosphere is beautiful, the service is delightful, and I really enjoy the food. I find it well worth the pricetag."

There are a ton of really cute shops and restaurants around the area you can go to for lunch or dinner after shopping. However, this restaurant is not up to par. Really not impressed with this restaurant at all. The service was pretty bad considering we barely saw our waiter. He seemed very nervous and was not friendly or welcoming at all. Later it would appear to be one of his first nights, because really that is the only explanation for some of his mistakes. 
We were celebrating a birthday and booked a reservation about a week in advance. The host was very nice and seated us right outside the kitchen. Not an ideal location, but one of the only areas large enough to accommodate our group so it is understandable. Our waiter introduced himself in a very monotone and flat manner, not warm or welcoming at all. We ordered two things for appetizer and he only brought one, we asked for our appetizer so many times and he said it would be out shortly. Then he would come back seeing if we needed anything and we would ask for our appetizer again. The calamari was really delicious which made me wish we could have tried the portabella mushroom di parma. Finally he came with our entrees and we never saw that second appetizer.
 Most of our table complained about their dishes, saying it lacked flavor, however, I enjoyed my pollo fiorentino (chicken with baby spinach, tomato, and mozzarella). It came with a side of pasta with marinara sauce and that was truly plain and not good, at all. Certainly not worth the calories so I didn&#39;t eat it. Then when we said it was our friend&#39;s birthday, they brought us a cake, but the waiter just kind of threw it on the table and said he couldn&#39;t find candles.  
The only reason I gave this restaurant 2 stars instead of one was because I reserve one star for honestly terrible restaurants with no redeeming qualities and this place had a good appetizer and I really enjoyed my entr√©e. However, if they want to compete in this area they really need to step it up. I certainly won&#39;t be going back."

That being said I now understand. We had 7pm reservation and sat down at 7:30- I can deal with that. Then my wife ordered lemon for her water and that never came. Then I ordered veal giuseppe and they brought veal saltimbocca. I appreciate the free tiramisu for the mix up but maybe not the best dessert when my wife is 7 months pregnant.....

There was a 20 minute wait so we decided to have a drink at the bar and eventually decided to just eat there. The food was good and the bartender was excellent.

Drove by downtown Downers Grove looking for a nice place to eat.  My girlfriend pointed out Capri and said her Uncle had been there and said it was good, and her best friend and husband enjoyed Capri. So I decided we could give it a shot.

I was clearly under-dressed and that was my fault for not being aware we were going to eat a late Italian meal.  

The menu looked promising.  I ordered Pollo Francese and she orderer Pollo Limone.  It took nearly an hour for us to get our meal.  We watched tableS(yes plural) were being served each course of their meal before we saw our entree.  It looked like they were serving a tables full courses before moving to the next table.  Tables got their salads, entrees, desserts and receipts before we got our entrees.  Luckily we did not order an appetizer.  When we did get our meals my meal wasn&#39;t to bad, my side of pasta was over done.  My girlfriend&#39;s was suppose to be lemony.  There was no lemon in her sauce, excluding the slice of lemon on top of the chicken.  The sauce was a heavy oil taste(I tasted it myself), her vegetables were very salty.

When the check came the waitress did not remove the lemonade I never got, because they were out.  So she removed it before running my card.

When I got home I thought about what to write on my review.  I then realized they charge me $3.00 more for one the entrees.  I checked the menu online to confirm.  I was considering calling the restaurant, but the damage was done.  

Our poor waitress was at the mercy of the chef(s). She got us a bread in the beginning.  She offered to get a 2nd one but took forever to get a second bread order.  At first I thought she was forgetful, I think the chef(s) had to bake it.  

I believe there was a guy who was working at the restaurant and working the bar who seemed to be a manager or owner.  No one ever came by to check on us or how things were.  That same guy did happen to talk several times to an older couple that was next to us because he did clearly know them.  He never checked on anyone else.  We were on the brink of leaving and paying for our drinks."

Had a dinner for a group of 20 in the semi private VIP Room.    We did family style apps; Calamari Capri and an dish with roasted peppers and sausage.  The Calamari Capri has a special sauce which really makes this special.  The apps were served &#34;family style&#34; and our waiter made sure everyone had plenty, refilling platters as needed.  Everyone raved about their entrees.  Service was excellent and the food delicious.  Highly recommend for small groups.  

It goes without saying this is a great place for regular dining too!   Try the grilled seafood app.  It is a meal in itself!"

Would go more if it were not for one larger issue.  The food at Capri is five stars in my opinion, and we have always had good service once we are seated.  I knocked the rating down to three because you cannot count on your reservations being honored on a Friday or Saturday night.  On numerous occasions I have made reservations on a Friday or Saturday evening, but we have had to wait 45 minutes for a table to be available after we arrived at the restaurant on time.  This is really frustrating, especially when we have hired a sitter for our kids.  I have had other people tell me that they have had the same experience.  I would recommend that if you want to enjoy the food, go any other night besides Friday or Saturday nights."

Mind you we were at a party for 20 ppl and note that they can only split up to 5 checks...oh and they had added 20% for tip. i normally see 18%, but it was my first time seeing 20%.

We were first given unlimited complimentary toasty bread that were warmed up in the oven. There were also Olive oil, cheese, roasted garlic, and olives on the table. Next, we had received our soup and appetizers. I had picked the minestrone soup. The soup was seasoned fine, but the vegetables were too overcooked. For appetizers, I had the Calamari Capri and free Bruschetta (For checking into Yelp). Calamari was cooked great, but it sat in oil that seemed to be seasoned with a slice of Lemon on top. I didn&#39;t taste any seasoning, so it was like dipping into Oil. I would of liked to have a wedge of Lemon to drizzle Lemon juice on top and marinara sauce to dip the Calamari in. This dish you wanted to eat quick, otherwise the batter on the Calamari will soak up the oil. Then, the Bruschetta is your typical toast with tomatoes and olive oil. Nothing special, but I think it was the best out of everything I had ordered. Finally, the entree I ordered was Fettucine ala Gamberi Scallopini Alfredo. The Creamy Alfredo sauce was very thick, which made it hard to pull apart the noodles, and it was a bit salty for my taste. I had to add pepper to balance out the saltiness.The Shrimp and scallops i believe were cooked okay, but the shrimp had the tails at the end. So it was inconvenient to eat the shrimp, then use your fingers to pull the tail off. 

Overall, the staff were nice, our water were filled, and the food was served at the right time. I personally won&#39;t be coming here for Italian food. 

Oh I can&#39;t forget to mention the incident of a staff member photo bombing the birthday girl blowing out the Candles. While, the staff was grabbing an empty plate across from the cake. He almost got his sleeve caught on fire from the candles on the Cake."

My husband called ahead and asked to put our name on the wait list, which we were told was 30 minutes long.  A little over a half hour later, we showed up asking for our table.  The hostesses told us it  would be an hour wait.  Excuse me?  I explained that we were told a table would be ready for us when we arrived, but they stated they didn&#39;t have any record of the reservation (insinuating we were lying), and that we would be required to wait an hour.

Frustrated, we left the building.  However, we really wanted to try this place and had already driven there and found parking (no easy task on a weekend), so I decided to give the restaurant a call and ask to speak to the manager.  When I did so, the hostess refused to let me speak to him, because he &#34;was busy with customers.&#34;  I insisted, stating I&#39;d be happy to hold, and eventually was connected.  I explained the situation to the manager (who had actually taken our reservation initially), and he apologized and kindly offered to remedy the situation, inviting us to come back for an immediate seating.  I was grateful he took action quickly, and fixed the situation, hence the 3-star rating.  

The manager followed through on his promise, and we ended up having a great meal, though our server was painfully slow.  It took a lifetime to get our bread basket, and each course after that.  

On a positive note, I ordered the vodka rigatoni, and it was some of the best I&#39;d ever had.  The homemade pasta is to die for, and truly makes a difference.  We also got the chocolate molten cake, which was a perfect ending to our meal - not too sweet, yet wonderfully decadent. 

I was a little annoyed that they brought out bottled coke products, rather than fountain drinks.  This isn&#39;t very Eco-friendly, and you don&#39;t get free refills.  I think the server should have mentioned this when we ordered.  Also, the garden salad was severely lacking - basically just lettuce with a few pieces of tomato and cucumber.  Plus, they didn&#39;t offer ranch dressing.  

I would come back, but I will definitely plan for a non-busy time - like maybe 3:00 pm on a Tuesday.  I wouldn&#39;t step foot in the joint on a weekend, because I&#39;m almost positive I wouldn&#39;t get seated even with a reservation."

We had reservations for 7:15 and our party of four didn&#39;t finish dinner until 9:45.  Several times we flagged the hostess to get our waitress as she kept avoided our area of the room like the plague. When she finally came over after the first flagging, she didn&#39;t even acknowledged how she had been gone for 20 minutes after they had taken away our appetizer and how we still had not ordered our dinner yet.  I was peeved.  Then after the second time, she did acknowledge her inattentiveness and was overly effusive in trying to compensate for it. In any case, the service was poor from her but the hostess was nice and helpful and explained that they were short staffed that night.

Despite this, the food was good. We started with some calamari, the spicy one that is  flash fried.  They have three versions of calamari on the appetizer menu, two are fried.  This was delicious. Then we ordered a garbage salad and a caprese salad. Both were ok, I&#39;ve had better.  The main entrees of eggplant parmigiana and seafood risotto were excellent. The risotto was like buttery.  The eggplant came with a side of homemade pasta with red sauce that was really delicious.

Overall, the food is decent but the service was not good on this night. I would definitely come back for the risotto."

The waiter told us salad was included with our dinner and would we like blue cheese on our salad.  When the bill came, there was a charge for the salad. &#34;Oh, that&#39;s not for the salad, it&#39;s for the blue cheese&#34;. An almost $4 charge for something we were offered without telling us there is a charge.  Sneaky and dishonest.

Also, our table asked for bread 4 times (twice from our waiter and twice from two other staff members). Nothing.

I would not pick this restaurant again. Too many good/better Italian restaurants to visit with better honest service."

Summer-oriented drink menu was lovely. We ordered our drinks, they arrived in a timely fashion. The restaurant was busy and not too crowded. We ordered our entrees and our salads. The salads were served in a timely fashion, however our two caesars and one garden turned out to be two gardens and one caesar. I didn&#39;t complain and ate a garden instead of a caesar, which I ordered. They were delicious, so no complaints. Wait staff was courteous and kept our water glasses full. Then...we waited for one hour for our entrees. We had to ask how much longer. We were told that the kitchen was backed up. However, this not being our first restaurant rodeo, we noticed that people were coming in after us, ordering, getting served, eating and leaving. We observed a table with two adults and a child who were seated outside having to also wait for their food. Our waitress, who also seemed to be on bartender duty, was pleasant but not efficient or very on top of her game. The food arrived extraordinarily hot. We wondered if it had been sitting then needed to be zapped. It was good, so there are no complaints there. The waitress came over and asked us how everything was, we said fine, and my cousin asked for red pepper flakes. They never came. We asked another passing by waitress who brought them over. The environment/ambiance was lovely, the wait staff was polite, the food was good (big question, zapped at the last minute?), the service and attentiveness was far below what we had expected."

He said the owner said this. Use your head and accommodate your customers. I will never go back there after the absolute rude treatment.

Nothing spectacular, but ok. The frustration now, twice in a row, is making a reservation well in advance and the host paying no attention to our seating request, and being extremely dismissive when asked about it.. Not, &#34;I&#39;m sorry, we can&#39;t meet your request tonight,but if you&#39;d like to wait, or sit over here...&#34; -- just a nasty look and an aggravated response. Once again, stuck us at a crowded table in the tiny back room brushed up against another couple, next to the kitchen door, with no acknowledgement of our request to sit in the larger room. It was a special occasion for us and there were tables open where we requested. When we asked for a different table, he moved us to another equally uncomfortable location. In the meantime, he seated another couple in the area we&#39;d requested. When we asked why he didn&#39;t seat us there to begin with, he had no explanation, pretty much saying fine, whatever, he&#39;d seat us at a nearby table when it was cleaned.

We were dressed nicely and in a good mood, looking forward to the night out. It was very disappointing, once again. The first time this happened (several months ago), we chalked it up to the host having a bad night. Twice in a row -- no thanks. There are plenty of restaurants nearby with better food who are way more respectful of their customers. If you have a good reason why you can&#39;t accommodate a request, say so politely, but don&#39;t completely ignore them, even after being reminded, and then make an attempt to fix it in a very fake, patronizing manner.

Food--overall very good. Bread was tasty and fresh (important for an Italian place!), I enjoyed my Caesar salad, and the pollo oreganato was very good (I swapped out the roasted potatoes for saut√©ed spinach, which was a little heavy on the oil but still decent).
Wine--pretty nice list. We ordered a glass each at the bar and our table ordered two bottles. We were happy with our choices, and they were well priced as well.
Service--this is where it goes south for me. While the host was very courteous and helpful (as he led us from the bar to our table, he carried our wine glasses for us, which I thought was a nice touch), service at the bar was mediocre at best (wine lists were basically tossed in front of us) and our server was...not rude, but not friendly.

It was a special so you would think they would have made the ravioli but it was heated from frozen (all of the ravioli was perfectly square and uniform) and had a very odd sweet sauce on top of the ravioli being 2 colors (black and orange). 

We ordered Jumbo shells with marinara. The sauce was good and the noodles were okay but the stuffing was not good at all. Usually I would expect ricotta cheese but this was something else. You shouldn&#39;t mess with a good thing. 

Finally I ordered the filet wrapped with pancetta. It smelled horrible (like fish? or meat that had turned) and the steak tasted like Omaha box steak (if you&#39;ve had these you know where I&#39;m at) The broccoli was okay but had no flavor. 

Overall, I was just really disappointed. It&#39;s not a cheap meal by any means. For something so expensive, I would expect the meal to actually be made there instead of being just heated from frozen... I&#39;m pretty sure the steak was heated from frozen too. It was perfectly round and the pancetta bacon was extremely thin. 

There is a very definite regular crowd that goes there and the staff tends to focus on them. That&#39;s cool and all but it came across as over the top and I have to think they make their money off the regulars. 

We won&#39;t go there again and we won&#39;t recommend it to anyone."

We made a reservation for 6 people and had to wait half an hour for our table. While waiting at the bar I asked the bartender for a drink menu. With attitude, I was told they don&#39;t have one. Ok. Strange, but ok. When the rest of our party arrived, they picked up a drink menu off the bar. When I asked the bartender, she replied &#39;well, it doesn&#39;t have ALL our drinks&#39;. Jeez, really?!

After we were seated at our very tight table ( I was amazed at how many tables they squeezed into this space to begin with), our waiter was very pleasant and knowledgable. The food took especially long, but was good though nothing extraordinary. 

All in all, I would not return to this restaurant. I love Italian food and generally find it hard to find a bad Italian restaurant, but this one made the list. Will go back to the burr ridge location next time!"

We headed over knowing that this restaurant is no longer part of the family owned Capris.  Consistency has been  the main stay of these restaurants for the 20 years I have been eating at them.  Today I could taste the difference.  It is the first time we have ever had food to take home ~ EVER.  We brought home more than we ate.

At least the bread was very good and very hot.

Maybe part of the sale of this restaurant was that the recipes had to be slightly tweaked since it was no longer family.

I can remember when you could not get near this place on a Saturday night without a reservation, actually, even with a reservation.  Tonight there were plenty of available tables.

So, I will have to drive to Burr Ridge or Berwyn if I want that delicious Capri cooking.  Bummers :("

We were seated promptly by a very nice hostess, and told that our waitress would be right with us.

Our waitress Jessica was very helpful on this, our first visit. I&#39;ve served in &#34;fine dining Italian&#34; myself, so I was very familiar with the ins and outs of the menu items - but I wanted recommendations from somebody who knew the food here very well. She did a GREAT job.

Recommendations were the bruschetta (fresh, simple, VERY good) and meatballs appetizers. We may not get both again - that&#39;s a lot of food - but either was a great starting choice.

We then decided to go all-in and tried the Caesar salad, chicken rice soup, and had the roasted garlic with our bread and oil. All impressed us. The soup seemed homemade. At this point, I also opted for a lovely Napizzano wine.

I got the veal parmesan - the best I&#39;ve ever had - and a side of pasta, which has a nice chew and a very nice sauce. The table cheese had a wonderful sharpness, likely some romano in there.

My wife tried the Sunday gravy, and absolutely loved it. I tried a couple bites, and it was pretty great - the flavor really had that slow-cooked richness.

One of the better Italian meals we&#39;ve had!"

For some reason the waitresses are bland and non personable.  Not all but every time we go and have a waiter the experience is 100% better. We ate there again and we always tip well  (30% ish) and while we were standing at the door putting our coats on our waitress walked by us, looked right at us and not a word. This was the way it was throughout dinner. We ordered dessert, there were 4 of us, and our waitress ran off after hearing it but neglected to ask if that was it, it wasn&#39;t and we had to order the other after the first arrived.  I know it&#39;s not a huge deal but this isn&#39;t fast food and the bill was well over 150$ so we gave a fairly good tip, almost  $50. This will not affect our going back as we will but maybe just a tip to make sure the staff is smiling and personable.  Oh, and I wouldn&#39;t change a thing about the food. 5 stars for food."

However, everything was fresh.  The fried calamari was well done--tender and not greasy.

I ordered the special mafaldine, which came with green beans, mushrooms, and sun-dried tomatoes.  I liked the noodles, which are homemade.  Their frilly shape and springy texture was really good.  The other ingredients were nothing to write home about.  The included house salad was very unremarkable.  

I also tasted the cannoli for dessert, and it was not bad.

The service was very courteous and nice, and I enjoyed the roasted garlic and olives that they put on the table with the bread.  The atmosphere is pleasant.

I&#39;m very picky when it comes to Italian food (100% italian heritage may have something to do with that... used to home cooked meals that not many restaurants can compete with - in my opinion). But Capri is an exception! 

This place has it all - great ambiance, intimate setting, beyond delicious food from the apps to main entrees to dessert/cappucino. 

They make homemade pasta - which says a lot right there! It adds a whole new dimension to Italian dining that I simply cannot explain. :) 

The desserts are great too - my fave being the homemade tiramasu, although on our recent trip we deviated from the norm and tried the canoli with chips. YUMMM. 

My only dislike is the caesar salad. The dressing is not creamy ceasar, which is my preference. However that&#39;s a personal preference for me, so next time I&#39;ll opt for the soup or house salad. Try the Caprese salad!! 

Service is great. Host is always friendly. Call for a reservation, but you&#39;ll often wait a few minutes to be seated. It&#39;s worth it though! Grab a glass of wine while you wait."

We called early Saturday afternoon for a 7p.m reservation that night. We got there at 6:45 and were not seated until 7:20. That just doesn&#39;t cut it folks. I wouldn&#39;t recommend this place if you have plans and need to be somewhere.

The food was decent, but pricey. Nothing too amazing. The servers were prompt and polite so the one star is justified. I just couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that this restaurant was all about image, and not so much with the substance.

We knew the restaurant was no longer family owned, but we didn&#39;t expect this big of a difference. We started off with the &#34;Calamari Forget a bout it&#34;, which, was nothing special. The salads were cold, but underdressed. When our orders arrived, all were there except mine, the Square Noodle Bascaiola. Instead was a rigatoni. The order was corrected and I had my correct order in about 15 minutes, long enough for my family to be finished with their meals. Unfortunately, that wasn&#39;t the only problem. My mother&#39;s linguini and clams were extremely salty, almost like licking a salt lick. My father and brother both ordered the Veal san Guissepe, which they told me tasted like it was thrown in a microwave. 
We left very disappointed that night-except for one thing. 
Our waitress was great. Nothing that had happened was her fault, but she took it upon herself to fix everything. She knew that we had been coming in for awhile and she really wanted to help make our experience better. She took of the linguini from our bill and gave my mother a free dessert on her. She really didn&#39;t need to do that, but we&#39;re very thankful and tipped her well. Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t catch her name or I would have praised her.

     We sat outside and enjoyed the cool weather along with the pretty legit singer/guitarist across the street covering hit 90&#39;s songs. The tables are located close to ongoing cars but traffic is slow so its not too bad. Thumbs up for the warm bread along with the plate of olives and GARLIC plus olive oil for dipping. I LOVE GARLIC. We began with the bruschetta which was satisfactory. As an entree, I tried the Square Noodle Bascaiola. It came with caesar salad which was lacking big time with dressing so I didn&#39;t eat much of it.  The pasta entree tasted like lasagna noodles with ragu sauce and a dollop of goat cheese. The dish required a lot more spice and flavor.  
     Towards the end of our meal I couldn&#39;t leave without checking in on YELP and realized a complimentary bruschetta was included.

  Part of what you pay for when you go out at a fancy place like this is the service and I don&#39;t mean just the waiters, which were fine. If you make a reservation you should get sat within 10 to 15 minutes of that time, and this place couldn&#39;t make that happen even early on a Saturday evening. 
  I&#39;d go to Clara&#39;s if you want good Italian food, Tuscany in Oakbrook if you seek fancy."

I SENT THEM AN E MAIL THE NEXT DAY BEFORE POSTING ON THE WEB. I have not heard back so here it goes. We made reservations for the 5 o&#39;clock seating. ( They had 3 seatings)...We were ok with that since we had plans for later that night...We have been here many times, along with a yearly purchase of gift certificates for our clients, and close friends. They had every table squeezed too close together to fit as many as possible, not thinking about comfort or pleasing the customer. They had a special menu, with very few pasta dishes.. ( 2 to be exact)... No chicken dishes at all...The dinner was rushed and the food was very spicy, and not what we have had in the past.  WE ALL WERE SICK THAT NIGHT....UPSET STOMACH, NAUSEA ,  AND OVERALL NOT FEELING WELL...   WE WILL NOT BE GOING BACK ANYTIME SOON.....  Service was very good, and the wait staff could only do so much, knowing they had less than 2 hrs each seating to do it all.  There was 6 of us...not a huge party, however I feel given that I sent them an e mail the next day, at least respond with an &#34;I&#39;m sorry&#34;  you had a bad experience. That would have been enough...Oh well I guess they must be doing so GOODl they don&#39;t have to worry about repeat customers..."

So when we were looking for something a bit different to try we figured we would check it out.

There is a small patio section which is extremely nice with a little fountain across the road and a very pretty Downers Grove.  when I first sat down I thought... this is really nice and relaxing... I wonder how many trains come through... I lost track after the 7th, two of which were long freight trains and seemed to go on for ever and made talking less then pleasant.

That aside it was everything I would expect of a fine Italian restaurant.  From what i saw of the inside it looked gorgeous!  Lots of dark woods and fine settings.  In addition the wait staff were polite and prompt and the food was better then expected for the price. (thou closer to the $30 per person then $11 on the scale)

All in all I would give it two thumbs up.  Despite the train noise it&#39;s a great location as you can stop in before jumping on the train, or possibly catch a nice dinner to unwind before driving home.  Just sit inside. :-)"

And, it does appear that there are many that actually appear to enjoy the food here, so please read my review that in mind.  Perhaps it was that I ordered a bad choice, or it was just an off night for them. Maybe it was also due to the fact that I had just come back from a trip to France, and after eating in Paris for a week, anything eaten in the West Burbs was going to fall hopelessly flat.  But whatever the reason, I found the food here absolutely atrocious, and certainly not worth the $$.  Which is surprising, as while I certainly enjoy fine cuisine, I am not a food snob by any means.  I&#39;m usually happy in a wide variety of places (hole in the wall taco bars to Michelin Star restaurants) as long as it tastes good. I rarely find myself hating something the way that occurred in this restaurant.   My wife, who ordered a different dish, had the same impression.  Neither of us came close to finishing our plates. 

The positives were that the decor was nice, and the service was polite and attentive.  But, in the end, we came there to eat something delicious, and that most certainly did not occur.  Most certainly not."

My wife had the four cheese gnocchi. The sauce was so thick you could not see the dumplings under it. No garnish. Not homemade pasta. Kit food at its best. I had the Pollo Saltimbocca. The chicken was boiled in whatever pan they cooked it in. (not hot enough) The Prosciutto should have been sauteed on the chicken an have a crispy finish to it, It was like eating uncooked bacon. The menu said &#34;served with fresh sage&#34; There was none to be found on the dish. It came with a side of pasta in a metallic tasting red sauce that was ice cold. It tasted like the sauce was cooked and held in an aluminium pot. The menu was huge and my guess is the kitchen is overwhelmed and the quality of the food suffers. This was an insult to Italian food. Along with the &#34;Pollo For Get About It&#34;... Yes that is a dish on the menu. I have $11 left on a gift card if you want it! I don&#39;t..."

This was my first experience at Joy Yee Noodle. Based on other Yelp reviews, I was looking forward to some great noodle dishes at a restaurant. Instead, what you get is a food court or college cafeteria experience. Lots of cheap white tables and cheap white chairs crowded into a small area. It looks sloppy and lazy because the tables are crooked (not in a nice line), and they are all unevenly tilted in different directions. There is no artwork, no color, no decorations, nothing appealing. They set the tables with glasses still wet from the dishwasher and a pile of utensils rolled up in paper napkins, which makes it hard to differentiate the clean tables from the dirty tables. All the dirty dishes are piled high in tubs on carts throughout the dining room, which is not something I want to see during my meal. And it was very loud.

The over-sized menu is ridiculous, having more than a 100 Pan-Asian entrees, appetizers, soups and sides... possibly nearing 200 menu items. The vast array of items is a huge clue that the food is mediocre. A good restaurant will &#39;Keep It Simple&#39; and offer a few items which are done well. A bad restaurant offers a complicated menu that lacks focus, and it is reflected in poor quality food.

To make things worse, I ordered the Japchae Lunch Special with a Strawberry Lemonade. I should have known better than to order a Korean dish in a Chinese restaurant. It tasted completely Chinese--was very heavy with oil and soy sauce--nothing like Korean japchae. I ate about a third to half of the dish and gave up, I seriously couldn&#39;t swallow the food anymore. The egg roll that comes with the meal was very crispy and not too oily. The taste was different than what I am used to--not good, not bad. 

The Strawberry Lemonade definitely missed the mark. It was a puree of strawberries and water. There was no lemonade tartness at all. Definitely over-priced at $3.95!

After they bring your food to the table, no one ever comes back to check up on you, which I am fine with. I wasn&#39;t sure if I should wait at the table for my bill, or go to the front counter. The lady sitting next to me decided to go to the front counter to pay, and a server scolded her and told her to go back to her table and wait for the bill. After seeing that, I stayed at my table and waited for the bill, which took about 10 minutes because the employees don&#39;t seem to monitor the dining area very well.

I wasn&#39;t impressed. I don&#39;t know what all the hype is about. I can see it&#39;s appeal for a quick lunchtime meal or take-out, but I wouldn&#39;t recommend it to my family or friends."

However, I was absolutely disgusted by my last visit. We were promptly seated, and poured glasses of water. I was about to take a sip, when I noticed flecks of something floating around the water. I figured, &#34;no big deal, just a fluke.&#34; Then I noticed floaties in both my friends&#39; water as well. I asked for a new glass of water and was brought one with fairly minimal griping. Problem solved, right? No. The new glass of water had EVEN MORE stuff floating around. I asked again, and the bus boy looked at me like I was crazy. Eventually a server came by and brought another glass of water for each of us. Problem still not resolved. We ended up leaving because my friends didn&#39;t feel comfortable eating there.

The design of this location is very contemporary and minimalistic. Most patrons seem to enjoy sitting towards the back on the elevated bench. Maybe it&#39;s because you can swing your legs and can keep an eye on the entire restaurant while you eat. 

  We sat at a regular table. Tables are still close to one another, but it&#39;s much better than before the renovation. The smoothie bar is much larger and towards the front of the restaurant. The entrance has also expanded, which allows you to not hover over someone else and drool into their food while you wait for a table. 

  I ordered my typical jackfruit avocado smoothie (with tapioca), the shrimp spring rolls, and I tried something new: the Korean spicy pork on a hot plate. The food came out quick enough and was very tasty, as always. The pork had just enough spice to it and was sizzling pretty much the entire time I ate. If you don&#39;t like hot peppers in your food, don&#39;t order this or ask them to make it mild. 

  The only thing that&#39;s changed about this place is the interior-same decent service, same delicious food, same Joy Yees vibe. It&#39;s just nicer because there&#39;s more space. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be back."

Really convenient location if you live in the west suburbs and want to get Joy Yee but don&#39;t want to go to the city. For the longest time I never noticed this Joy Yee (even though I&#39;m at HMART all the time) and always went to the one in Chinatown Square or University Village. Honestly, I only go here for the smoothies. The food at Joy Yee is fine if you&#39;re a quantity over quality kind of person, but the fruit smoothies are really really good. My favorites are the jackfruit, durian, or avocado freeze with tapioca and crystal jelly, but any smoothie you get here is pretty solid.

Food wise, the menu is huge so you&#39;re bound to find something you like, but it&#39;s also Pan Asian. I feel like the thing with a lot of Pan Asian places is that they don&#39;t do any one particular kind of food well since the menus are always several pages long. This is no exception. Everything I&#39;ve tried here is pretty mediocre. Like not great, but I&#39;d probably eat it again if the opportunity was there. Portions are huge, but lackluster. When in doubt, you can never go wrong with the beef cubes.

Overall, I&#39;d recommend Joy Yee, if nothing else just for the smoothies. Also a good place to eat when no can can agree on just one thing!"

Gigantic portions of food, a dizzying selection of bubble teas and other delicious cold drinks. I&#39;ve tried a variety of dishes and drinks over the years, and usually just order my usuals now. There was one dish in particular I did not like (fried chicken lemon grass or something like it - very dry, too salty), but everything else I have absolutely loved. Soup portions are huge. Fried rice comes in a mountain. Veggies are always fresh and never wilted. Most of the time, your meat dishes come with a very generous amount of meat. Food comes out quickly. Almost every time I come to eat here or pick up my take-out, the place is hopping full of people. They&#39;ve got quite a following. Makes me feel bad for the other Asian mom and pop restaurants that are relatively empty, but man their food is good.

Docked one star for the service and recent price increase of the drinks. Definitely one of the places you go to for the food, not the service. However, my husband has developed quite a good rapport with one of the gentlemen there (probably because at one point last winter, we were there at least once a week) - he appears to have some kind of managerial/owner role, and he&#39;s always been great to us!

We ordered spring rolls, sesame chicken and fun (the noodles, but eating here is pretty fun too). Everything came out quickly and the flavors were awesome. The host and servers are super friendly and appreciate their customers.

I checked it out and I really enjoyed my lunch. The interior reminds me of the other Joy Yee&#39;s I&#39;ve visited. It&#39;s tight quarters and you might end up overhearing your neighbor&#39;s conversation on the Bluetooth headset, but the food is worth the somewhat awkward situation.

I went with the lunch combo of the basil chicken (includes white rice and an egg roll) and also a Vietnamese iced coffee with coffee jelly. The portions are so generous, but I still ended up eating everything because it&#39;s sooo good. It wasn&#39;t my favorite rendition of basil chicken, but it was still mighty tasty. I love Vietnamese iced coffee and the jelly gives it a nice flair.

Their menu is so overwhelming. It&#39;s pages and pages of drinks and food. Going at lunch helps narrow it down if you decide to just stick to the lunch combos. Otherwise, I recommend coming with a plan or else you might struggle at choosing.

The food is good here too! We ordered the Japanese tofu, the garlic Chinese broccoli, and fried chicken Hainan chicken. Super tasty and more than enough rice to go around.  The Japanese tofu is lightly breaded and fried with salt and pepper seasoning.  They have small crispy rice noodles mixed with shallots and jalape√±os.  The Chinese broccoli was good too, but a little bit on the garlicky side.  The leaves have a bitter taste but the garlic made it better.  They didn&#39;t over cook the veggies and had a good crunch to it.  The fried Hainan chicken was great!  No complaints about it. 

The bubble tea is what we really only come here for.  They have a plethora of flavors and you can mix your own fruit flavors if you don&#39;t see it on their ginormous menu.  My top picks here: taro, green tea, honeydew, watermelon, lychee.  Sometimes I end up mixing lychee to the honeydew or watermelon.  But I love this bubble tea because they use fresh fruit.  Also since their opening, they have new flavors that I hadn&#39;t seen prior to closing.  Chocolate bubble tea and cookies n cream?  Kind of odd at first but I&#39;ve seen many customers ordering the chocolate so I&#39;m going to give that a try next time."

My very first experience, their mapo tofu clenched it. Hubs: &#34;Oh, they have mapo tofu.&#34; The 90s came screaming back to me. Hanging out in his apt with me in ugly Umbro shorts, eating/gagging on the Mapo Tofu he made me. Oh, please NO! 

I ordered my food and he ordered mapo tofu with his polite &#34;Please feel free to eat as much mapo tofu as you want.&#34; Yeah right.  

I kept eyeing his while I slurped my soup. The mapo tofu didn&#39;t smell like his. --It smelled better. I caved and inched my spoon forward. Suffice it to say, I loved it so much, Joy Yee became a bi-monthly rotation ever since.  Lots of flavor depth and huge pieces of tofu and ground pork. It sounds vegetarian but this is definitely not.

I&#39;m not entirely sure if this is your place for Crab Rangoon or Sweet &amp; Sour Chicken. But this is your place if you&#39;re ordering dishes such as Baked Rice with Chicken &amp; Salted Fish (not on the menu but yelper Karen D suggested it. Delicious), my family&#39;s favorite Mapo Tofu, Korean Beef Kimchi over Stone bowl rice, or their Korean Kimchi Beef Fried Rice....because trust me,  Kimchi should be eaten on everything!  

Their new restaurant is a vast improvement even if their closing was nearly the death of me. Much more space and much easier to come in and order take-out. It used to feel like quite the crush with even 3 people waiting. -No space to even stand. There&#39;s no explaining why it took so freaking long to reopen, but all is forgiven now that I can eat my kimchi again. 

My tongue watered just typing this."

The restaurant wasn&#39;t too busy when we got there, so we were seated right away. This location is decorated very similarly to the other Joy Yee locations in Chinatown, University Village and Evanston, which are all contain pretty modern furniture. We ordered two orders of Beef Cubes over Tomato Rice (Bo Luc Lac, if you are Vietnamese or know the dish by that name) and I also got an order of Durian Fruit Freeze, without tapioca (Sinh To Sau Rien). 

The food came quickly and was well-seasoned. The only comment I have to make is that the onions that were cooked with the beef were very strong (undercooked), which stayed with me for hours after the meal. The Durian Fruit Freeze was delicious and had enough durian flavor that I was looking for. Side note: durian is not for everyone, but if you&#39;re feeling a little adventurous, go for it! If anything, it will be a memorable experience for you."

I saw this Joy Yee location wasn&#39;t far away so we went over. 

Their lunch specials were good and well priced. I think it was $8 for a pad Thai the kids inhaled. It came with a soup and an egg roll. I got a Korean noodle soup and it was ok, not the best thing I&#39;ve ever eaten but not bad. Next time I&#39;d do a lunch special. 

The bubble teas were a disappointment. I got an almond milk tea and it tasted watered down. There just wasn&#39;t enough flavor in it. The bubble teas at the Chinatown location are always good so this was a letdown. 

The service was good. Everyone was very nice. 

I can&#39;t say I&#39;d recommend this specific location but I still love Joy Yee!"

I cannot rate their service because we didn&#39;t eat there. Maybe one of these days, we will come over and have lunch or dinner. I didn&#39;t give them 5 stars because I ordered Spicy orange chicken and Spicy basil beef, both are delicious but not spicy! The beef teriyaki baked rice was so savory, this is our favorite and I highly recommend it. When the restaurant closed and we saw it in Facebook that it was permanent we were crushed. It was the saddest day of our lives! But now that they are open, I will not complain anymore! We will still comeback and order more bubble tea and other delicious stuff in their menu."

And then it closed. And though I had heard it was remodeling, I wasn&#39;t holding my breath. 

But alas! Joy Yee has shown back up on grub hub and is back in my regular rotation of delivery spots. I haven&#39;t been back in to check it out, but I HEAR it looks awesome and clean and delightful. As for the delivery - the food comes hot and fresh and well packaged, the bubble drinks come cold and blended and full of those delightful tapioca balls that make them so weird and lovely. The pork fried rice is tasty, and the orange chicken is sweet, crispy, chewy, Americanized perfection.

Stopped in on a Saturday for lunch with our family of 6. Ordered the large bowl of Vietnamese pho soup to start - broth was just ok, but bowl loaded with different types of beef which made up for the lack of broth taste. We also ordered the Korean bulogi beef served over white rice - tasty but on the salty side. Kids ordered Orange beef and not touched since there were red peppers, making it too spicy for them. Only giving 2 stars for the food, service 4 stars tho, was treated politely and timely. Prices definitely went up which might stop us from coming here in the future."

Then we tried our old favorites, eel and chicken teriyaki, salt and pepper smelt, salt and pepper tofu, chicken fried rice, and chicken dumplings. As usual, service was very fast. We got our food in about 10 mins.  I like their food but definitely the drinks are why we go.  Prices were same as I remembered and they&#39;re not too expensive.

There are loads of drinks options, probably at least 100 variations of flavors (if not more) for milk teas, bubble drinks, slushes, and more. My husband &amp; I ordered the chicken and shrimp pad thai. Delicious! It still needed something to balance the total flavor, but a couple dashes of sriracha does the trick! It was amazing. For drinks, my husband ordered the avocado bubble tea and I ordered the honeydew green milk tea with mango pudding; of course they were delicious.

I don&#39;t know what took so long for them to re-open, but I&#39;m glad they&#39;re here as it&#39;s a good spot in the area for lunch.

The decor is super trendy and fresh, kind of like being inside IKEA and not at all the like often dark, tacky Chinese take-out places nearby.

The food is really good.  I had the Pad Thai with chicken and shrimp and ordered it spicy.  It wasn&#39;t spicy enough for my liking, so I guess I&#39;ll ask for &#34;extra spicy&#34; next time.  It was really good though, and the portions are generous but not outrageous.  I like that this is offered as a lunch special and served with an eggroll too.

I also had a watermelon lychee smoothie with tapioca.  It was so good, with FRESH fruit and FRESH tapioca that wasn&#39;t overly chewy.  My friend had some kind of iced coffee drink that also looked really good.

The menu is ENORMOUS.  The size of the menu is like unfolding a Rand McNally atlas, and the variety of food is quite endless as well.  Descriptions are in Chinese and English, flip around and you&#39;ll find what you&#39;re looking for.

Service was a little hectic during lunch time.  We received our food and were well into chowing down when we realized we still hadn&#39;t gotten our drinks.  Joy Yee is the new hotspot in central Naperville now that it has re-opened, and they&#39;re doing a ton of business for take-out orders too, so it appears they might be short staffed.

Definitely stop in here when you&#39;ve got the time."

Unfortunately, they don&#39;t have the right type of chili or chili sauce for the pho. When I asked for some, they brought gochujang. The broth in the pho is not very flavorful, and they don&#39;t include any of the necessary bean sprouts, thai basil, thai chilis, or lime wedges for you to add at your leisure. The dish we got, a poor szechuan impersonation, was underseasoned, but had too much sugar, too much starch in the sauce, and had almost no heat. In addition, some of the seats are incredibly uncomfortable, especially the bench style seating next to the walls.

In conclusion, if you want lackluster Asian food in a desert of Asian food, come here. The drinks seem popular, if not also diabetus-causing.

Last year I was here, I ordered a durian smoothie and it came out with ants floating on top. They claimed it was seeds. Nice try. Durian seeds are similar to avocado pits so how is that even blendable. They tried their hardest not to give me a refund. Don&#39;t get me started on the sheer amount of msg they put in their food.

This visit I ordered an almond milk tea less sweet with no boba, I get an almond milk tea with boba. I told them, so they decide to just scoop out the boba and add a lot more ice. Thanks for ripping me off while I stand 1 foot away. I love that they&#39;re so cheap that they can&#39;t remake it but would rather cheat the customer to save money.

In all honesty, if you call and get a woman on the phone, just hang up. I&#39;ve worked with each gentleman there and haven&#39;t had communication issue for delivery. This time, I go in to order take out. 45 minutes I sat and waited in view of every employee, then scoffed at by the same girl when I wondered why soup took 15 minutes longer then orders much much larger than mine. Mind you, no one had been given their wait time, which was upwards of 20-30 minutes.

Regardless, being treated with such negligence and blatant rudeness... I&#39;m never giving a dime of my money to this &#34;business&#34; again.

   &#34;Could I have Mushroom and Tofu Soup, extra spicy?&#34;

&#34;We don&#39;t have that.&#34;

&#34;You mean Tofu Mushroom Soup?&#34; She said with a snide tone and confused face
   
   &#34;....Yes, could I have that extra spicy please?&#34;

She then proceeded to look at me in a way that I can only describe as if I had asked her to take her top off.

Then the look I got when she realized my soup had been sitting around, because it was cold after a mere 5 minute drive home... My food given to me with the biggest resting b***h face I&#39;d ever seen.

To any management reading this, you have plenty of decent female employees, but you&#39;re food is too expensive for mediocre flavor, front desk staff unapologetic, and that person I&#39;m talking about? I won&#39;t describe her in detail because deep down I know you know who it is."

My favorite part of coming to Joy Yee is getting the fruit freezes.  They are all made with fresh fruit (which you can see lined up behind the bar counter).  You can also add in goodies like tapioca bubbles, popping boba, fruit pieces, and pudding chunks.  A couple of my favorite combinations include: taro with tapioca, coconut with taro pudding, watermelon, lychee with tapioca.

Their menu is filled with plenty of &#34;safe options&#34; (orange chicken, potstickers) and equally many adventurous ones.  I highly recommend the special beef soup...there are some interesting goodies in there but the tenderloin is so so good.  The basil garlic shrimp and calamari was also great.  We asked for medium spice and they definitely did not disappoint.  Not too spicy but not too bland.

I really enjoy this place and I&#39;m glad that there&#39;s a location in Naperville so i don&#39;t have to trek out to Chinatown for good food!

Like cheesecake factory, the menu is overwhelming and replace cheesecake with smoothies!  
There are pages and pages of options.  The smoothie menu is amazing-there are pictures and descriptions of each smoothie.

I&#39;ve been pleased with almost everything that I&#39;ve gotten here.  The soups are hearty and filling.  I&#39;ve had the beef udon, beef cubes with tomatoes, the Malaysian fish curry, and the vermicelli bowl.  They have all been consistently good and the portions are huge.  My favorite is the beef cubes dish-so juicy and flavorful.  Since this is a Pan-Asian restaurant, the items are not super authentic and some of the items will be better at another restaurant that specializes in that cuisine-I&#39;ve had better vermicelli noodles at a Vietnamese restaurant.  However, everything here is solidly good and a great place to go to for a large group since there is something that everyone should like.

Like other reviewers have stated, the smoothies are amazing.  They are made with mostly fresh ingredients.  Like the food, the smoothies are generously sized.  So many options for every preference.  Call me basic, but I love the milk tea.  its simple and made well.

First of all, I ordered taro bubble tea. It&#39;s on their menu, and I see other people&#39;s pics of it here on Yelp so I know they make it! What they gave me neither looked nor tasted like taro: it tasted like chocolate milk with a dash of coffee. (May I add that taro milk tea is lavender-colored and this was light brown.) I didn&#39;t go to pick it up and my bf didn&#39;t know the difference, but someone clearly fucked up, either knowingly or not.

My pineapple chicken-shrimp fried rice was pretty pallid. Aside from the meats and pineapple...that was it. No veg or anything else. What? The meats were well cooked, not tough or anything, but something is missing here...

The dude got short ribs and thus won the jackpot. These were sliced thin and coated with a sweet-rich glaze of some sort. YUMMM. 

We also got crab rangoon which was pretty good; at least something other than cream cheese was discernible inside. 

Overall, though, I know Joy Yee can do better than this. I&#39;m willing to try again but this wasn&#39;t an exemplary &#34;fresh start.&#34;"

Despite being super busy, the staff was very attentive and patient with us. One of my friends had a few questions regarding some dishes and the waiter happily answered all of her questions and made some very helpful suggestions. 
We all ordered a variety of dishes such as Bibimbop, pineapple chicken fried rice, teriyaki chicken over rice, Korean BBQ short ribs, and Vietnamese Egg Roll Vermicelli Noodles. Everyone enjoyed their food and we had to take most of our food home because the portions were pretty big. No complaints though because you get what you pay for. Since Joy Yee is a pan-asian restaurant, I didn&#39;t expect every dish to be super authentic but I wasn&#39;t too disappointed in the dishes that we ordered.
After we stuffed our faces, we decided to end our meal with some boba milk tea. I got the red bean coffee tapioca and even though it may seem like a strange combo, trust me, it&#39;s good!

It is amazing how well flavored their boba tea is especially with the tapioca and how robust the food dishes are. No problem ordering carryout orders.

The main thing that brought my review down to a three star review is the service. I had come in to sit down with my friend for the first time here and we had to wait at least 5 minutes before someone can take care of us. This was also on a Thursday afternoon where only five other tables were in the restaurant other than us and they were standing around doing nothing. They didn&#39;t seem to be very interactive and friendly either. Also, when we were given our check, we felt rushed because he was standing there staring us down waiting for the bill and he even tried taking the bill when I was still putting my part of the bill in cash. He then also stood there waiting for us to put our tip on the table and right when we put our tips down he took it from our table and left. I honestly felt like we were rushed and not welcome to stay for such a long time. Otherwise, no complaints about the food whatsoever. It was super delicious!! 

I would recommend this place if you were to do carryouts and just stop by to pick up some beverage. The service here needs a lot more improvement."

It is much darker and sweeter and I didn&#39;t like it all. Plus, I was amazed at how much they have changed the portion sizes. They filled the bottom of the bowl with big leaves of lettuce and then put the food on top. What looked like a big bowl of food was really only half a bowl. They have also increased the spicy heat of the Sweet and Sour soup. I didn&#39;t mind it but someone who doesn&#39;t like spicy food would have found it way too spicy."

They closed because of &#34;remodeling&#34; that they never applied a permit for, and ever since reopening things have been downhill. From food quality, to the inconsistent orders I have received. 

My personal beef was with Jennifer today. The &#34;delivery manager&#34; which some days they decide that they will deliver to oakbrook where I work, and sometimes not. I also work customer service, and they obviously don&#39;t have any here. 

It took 30 minutes longer then they told me over the phone because they got our address wrong. I originally called to order 3 orders of Korean bbq short ribs, and when the gentleman took my order, he stated that but he only delivered one and charged me for one. I called back and said I wanted to order and pay for the second 2 but I didn&#39;t think they should charge me for the second delivery, being that it wasn&#39;t my fault and they charge 8.50$ from naperville to oakbrook. She said &#34;you have to pay if we send someone else out&#34; I told her I didn&#39;t want it and that it was fucking ridiculous. 

Fast forward 5 hours. My coworker called to ask if they do delivery for 3 smoothies without knowing my experience earlier, and she said &#34;nope, we don&#39;t deliver to that address&#34;. her attitude is just so unprofessional but then again, it is a fast food pan Asian restaurant, where the customer is never right. 

Calling in and talking to her or the real Manger isn&#39;t worth the frustration, but I felt like the yelp world would be able to get a laugh out of my frustration. Lmfao"

I had been waiting...and waiting...and waiting for this day to come for a L-O-N-G time!  Finally Joy Yee reopened and we were able to come in for a nice meal.  Thank goodness they decided to paint away the florescent yellow green walls--the decor is modern and chic without having to go overboard with the crazy minimalistic vibes of fluorescent paint.  Yuck!  But really, I&#39;m Chinese and used to the whole concept of good food in typical hole-in-the-walls and so for years I just ignored it.  No more Joy Yee, you have definitely taken a big step up with the roomier dining area and nice ambiance.  

The food is just what I remember---always a step above good!  Yum. Yum. Yummy!  Although we usually don&#39;t go for lunch we decided to stop in since it was our first opportunity to stop in.  We started out with the Lychee Tapioca &amp; Taro Tapioca drinks.  Score---just as good as I remember!  The Spring Rolls were very good although they were made with shrimp only, no additional pork added in as in the traditional Vietnamese way they are generally made.  Okay so no pork but that&#39;s okay they were still delicious.  Finally, the Salt &amp; Pepper Shrimp and the String Bean Salty Fish were AMAZING!!!!  They really impressed with these two dishes!  

So my takeaway is that Joy Yee hit a home run once again.  I am sure that they will be crazy busy again once everyone knows that they have re-opened.  My only concern is that they did raise the prices a bit and that&#39;s why the 4 stars instead of 5.  The lunch as listed above was $49.49 without tip for 2 people.  Yes we did take a bit home for leftovers and we did order shrimp.  The portions were big but wow we just thought a bit high-priced for lunch (no special lunch menu on the weekend)."

I have to say that the dishes are quite tailored to American taste, quite Asian Fusion style. We ordered the fried rice with eel and steak last time and it was so tasty, but very greasy. It came in a huge bamboo bowl. The only thing I do not like is the display of menu (this is why I am only rating 4 stars), which separates the pictures with prices. I would say if it is tasty, I will not care about the price at all. But the fact that the eel fried rice was indeed $22 when we saw the check, is quite a surprise to us.

It was supposed to be a big rainy day and I was hoping it wont be super crazy and it wasn&#39;t.
To begin with, they took our name to have us seated and then we realized they were seating people as and how they wanted. Did not care about who came first who came second.

We were seated pretty soon and then the wait beings...... 10-20-30-40 minute go by and no one decides to come and take our order, people who came after us had their order taken but we were missed..
I finally gave up and went to the managers counter to have our order taken. Someone did show up after 5 minutes....
order given...
and now the wait begins again.. 10..15..20 and finally food shows up after 30 minutes.

The manager came up asking how it was and we told how our experience was ... manager apologized and we let it go... 

now we are waiting for our bill..
10-20-30... we gave up went to the counter and said do you want us to pay or just leave.....
we paid and left... it took us us 2+ hours from entry to exit at this place..

food is good (only reason stopping me from giving zero stars). but is it really worth it?

I have been here probably a few dozen times before the remodel so I was glad the place reopened back for business after countless delays. 

We ordered a few of the usual stuff, curry chicken coconut rice, some shrimp and a bunch of freezes. Unfortunately half of our order was wrong and most notably the order for one of our friends didnt get put in up until the last minute. She got it as we were leaving even though we asked 5 times about her food. We ended up having to share the food so we could leave on time. The other dishes also had stuff in there that shouldn&#39;t be there. Overall very poor customer service. 

On a different note, the food was very tasty as usual however I do feel like the portions got smaller. This time the curry chicken arrived with some veggies which was never the case before. There was noticeable less chicken. 

All the food was very good I just wish they would improve the service. The indian place across the parking lot costs about the same but the service is superb. 

They also didnt install any noise dampening so the place is fricking LOUD!

First, I should probably explain that my family and I used to be regulars here back in the day and have frequented their Chinatown location in the past as well. So as you can guess, we were very excited about the Grand Re-opening of this location, but much to our disappointment, it kept getting pushed back.
Eventually, when I did go, I took two co-workers with me during lunch who had never experienced Joy Yee before, both of which are not of the asian-decent. They loved the food. They loved it to the points that they ordered carry out for their spouses, who also loved it. However, from my point of view, the serving sizes did look a bit smaller. In addition, they also had no ice water? Just 
&#34;cold&#34; tap water. What also is good to note is that two of the parties sitting next to us got up and left in the middle of their meals due to the extremely slow service they received. What really sets an Asian restaurant apart from an American restaurant is the fact that if you argue with an employee about the service being slow or the food being wrong, the employees will argue/yell back. Which is quite unprofessional.

Overall, Good Food (if you get lucky and get served), Bad Service. Also, Very Very Loud."

We&#39;ve always liked the food here, but we LOVE the drinks here!! There are SO many flavors and combinations of fruits and tapiocas and jellies and teas you can put together, they are just so much fun and so tasty. My go-to favorites are often the red bean, taro, milk teas, and anything with some mango, but seriously, all the drinks are awesome and have always been the main attraction for me here."

Came on a Friday night and while the wait staff had good intentions, service was incredibly slow, unresponsive, and inefficient. They forgot a drink order and then again, two entree orders. It took over an hour to receive all orders after multiple attempts at getting the attention of the wait staff. And it took another 15 minutes to wave anyone down to get the bill.  1 of the 6 entrees we ordered (beef with tomato rice) was the same as before and really good. The pho dac biet had almost no meat, no noodles, and just tons of broth. The same with the egg noodle seafood dish. It&#39;s like they started skimping on portions though they were will served in the gigantic bowls. It was all together a disappointing family dinner and with the exception of the rice dish, we probably won&#39;t be back for a long time."

Luckily they were able to seat us without a problem (party of 7 can sometimes be tough) however I would recommend making a reservation at this restaurant. They have a range of items to chose on their menu.. I had a tough time deciding what to order as everything sounded appetizing. I started with a wedge salad, which had an interesting dressing on it. For dinner, I ended up ordering the perogies which I&#39;m so happy I did because they were amazing!! They were cooked perfectly and the sauce that came with them was delicious. One of my friends ordered the lamb shank and it looked amazing - I&#39;d prob recommend this just based on seeing it (he did say it was really good too). 

Overall, if I were back in St. Charles again I would definitely go here. Our waitress was really sweet and she put up with the poor jokes that my friends made with her which makes her like a saint! We had a great dinner and no complaints!"

The charcuterie board consisted of Point Reyes blue cheese, Hand dipped ricotta with local honey, Anabasque, House made Pork &amp;Truffle terrine, Italian proscuitto di parma aged 600 days, and Mild Spanish chorizo. It&#39;s served with cinnamon raisin and sourdough toast points, pear puree, housemade stone ground mustard, and dill pickles. I&#39;m a huge fan of adult lunchables ( Oh yeah, you know that&#39;s what that is :D), and these were amazing. The combinations were fantastic, and individually they were great on their own. My personal favorites were the blue cheese and the pork and truffle terrine. I would go back just for the charcuterie. 

The sumac lamb chop starter comes with sumac spice, quinoa cake, mint and orange gremolata, cipollini onions, and a cucumber creme. Both of us loved it, all of the elements really went well together and the lamb chops were perfectly cooked.

The wedge salad was ok, but the salad dressing is so strong it overpowers everything else. It&#39;s really spicy and peppery, you don&#39;t really get any blue cheese from it. We asked the waitress about it and she said that they add their house made mustard to it. If you dig spicy then go for it, but I would recommend not adding pepper to it, i&#39;m glad we skipped out on that. We dig spicy so we were fine, but there&#39;s no mention on the menu of it being spicy, so if you&#39;re sensitive to spicy and peppery go with another salad, or maybe ask for the dressing on the side or sub with a different dressing?

For dinner I had the grilled Ahi Tuna. It comes with israeli couscous with scallions and basil, and roasted farm tomato eggplant. First off, that israeli couscous was awesome. I would divorce my husband and marry that couscous. Freaking loved it. The tuna was ok, but the couscous and eggplant were my favorite parts, they were so good.

The man had the flat iron steak, it comes with chimichurri, calabrese potatoes, watercress, pickled onion, and parmesan fondue. The steak was perfectly cooked, and he loved it. 

Dessert we went with churros, they come with chocolate ganache and strawberry creme. The churros were perfectly cooked, they were so good. 

Now onto BOOZE!!!
We did not have any of the wine, so I cannot attest to their wine selection. They have beer on tap from local breweries, including the session sour from Penrose brewery which I absolutely love. It can be hard to find a sour at restaurants sometimes. 

The man had a whiskey sour, which he was a fan of, even though the egg white threw him off at first. I had a perfectly made dirty martini with blue cheese olives. Is there anything better than vodka and blue cheese olives? Yes, the israeli couscous from here. That&#39;s it, there&#39;s nothing else. I also had the cucumber cocktail. It&#39;s presented with basil and mint leaves, and looks really pretty. I highly recommend ripping those leaves up and muddling them in the drink, it really helps bring out those flavors. Really refreshing drink for a hot summer night. 

TL;DR Overall we absolutely loved this place and plan on going back. The salad dressing for the wedge salad was really peppery, and the tuna was just ok, but everything else was awesome."

We ordered the one app one special: fried artichoke hearts. They were delicious, they was huge and not overly fried. There is a spicy aioli and and sweet chutney, delish. 
Also, a few wines and all the tap beers are half off for happy hour. So, I ordered a Margarita. The Yelp reviews were too good to pass up, and the drink delivered. It was AWESOME. The foam on top is so tasty, it may be egg white something, but don&#39;t be discouraged, just try it. For $10, one was enough, but I wish I could have afforded three. I also got a beer, good too, but the margarita is a must.

It was a cool day so the beef barley soup was a great start. My wife got the grilled Caesar salad with a poached egg and lucky for me she shared it because it was outstanding. 
For entrees I had the pheasant, which you rarely see on menus. It is a signature dish and it was wonderful. In my youth I hunted with my Dad and pheasant was always our favorite. The breast was on a bed of risotto and truffles. The dark meat was like a duck confit but in a pastry pillow. Wow. My wife had the poached salmon which was ok. 
We finished with a banana bread pudding.

You really have to watch carefully or you&#39;ll drive by it on Main like we did. Just park behind the Shell station and you&#39;re there. A great eclectic menu with specials written on the tile wall. We started with fried artichokes and a grilled Caesar salad, both marvelously delicious. In fact we all agreed that the Caesar was the best we&#39;ve ever had. The wine special was a pleasant Barbera. 

There were lots of other specials but we stuck with the menu, beef cheek and flat iron steak. The beef cheek was fork tender and very tasty. It had a dark sauce with sp√§tzle, turnips and parsnips (not my favorite veggies) but you couldn&#39;t tell that by my plate. My wife&#39;s flat iron was also tasty and rich. Our friends had flat iron and pheasant.  We finished with pound cake, white chocolate, raspberry martini and pana cotta. 

This is a new favorite for us. It&#39;s about a forty minute drive but well worth it. I marveled that we found this in St.  Charles and not downtown Chicago. Oh and don&#39;t miss Mario, the effervescent and jovial roving host."

Finery. I must say, it was not up to the 4.5 stars reviewers gave it.  Here&#39;s a recap:

Pros:  good wine and beer selections.  Interesting menu with many items I  really like.  

Cons:  lamb shank had great flavor but wasn&#39;t falling off the bone as advertised.  Sides were not working well with this dish.  Spaetzle was overshadowed by squash and other ingredients - too busy.  My wife had salmon.  Undercooked to the point that it was mush in the middle.  Major turn off.  Service was off too.  Slow, and this was a week night where the restaurant was not busy at all.  

Overall, tried it but nothing special, which is what we wanted.  The floor plan is somewhat odd too, bar is separated from dining room.  Seems closed in, prefer an open, airy atmosphere."

Don&#39;t expect to get a seat, especially not on a Friday night. We made a reservation and still had to wait 30 minutes which was annoying but understandable since there is limited seating.

FOOD: What everyone else said--GET THE PHEASANT! I&#39;ve never tried it before but this place prepared it to be super tender and juicy. I ended up ordering the Flat Iron Steak which was also incredible with their chimichurri sauce. Another guest in our group ordered the Beef Cheek and was not entirely impressed. I love the Calabrese Potatoes but others in the group thought they tasted like dirt. We also ordered sides of the Romanesco (cross between broccoli &amp; cauliflower) and Brussel Sprouts--both were a bit crunchy for my taste but flavorful.

VALUE: The beets were a joke for $9. There were maybe 4 slices and although they tasted great, it was hard to comprehend that we just paid more than $2 per tiny slice. I find it funny that they charge for bread especially at such a nice place where you know the avg bill for 2 is going to be around $60-75. The entrees were fairly priced because they were so delicious!

Overall, chic atmosphere (although I wish the crowd was a bit more mixed), drinks are creative, apps and sides were okay, entrees were awesome, bathrooms are clean. Would come back!"

We decided to come about a month after opening last year and the food was absolutely amazing. With the servicers being wonderful and knowledgeable of the food, and the food being to die for, we decided to have our rehearsal dinner for our wedding here. 

David, the owner, worked with us on giving food recommendations, putting a menu together, and also was just someone who genuinely cared about the experience we were having. It was nice to see an owner of a restaurant doing whatever they could to make their customers experience the best it could be, and David did that for sure!  

We had nearly 75 people and rented out the restaurant area for our rehearsal. They brought in a very well designed curtain to separate the bar area from the dining area which looked really nice and gave us the privacy which is nice to have with a private event. I know I previously mentioned this, but the servers that you get at this place are truly amazing. They educate you on the food you are eating and know the food that is being served. If that isn&#39;t good enough, they also see when a glass is getting empty and bring over another glass of wine!

The food we had for our event was the country pheasant, flat iron steak, and the salmon. All three are fantastic options and I would recommend any of the three. The cheese and Charcuterie plate as an appetizer as well is a must every time we come here moving forward. We have now tried almost every appetizer and a majority of the main courses and have yet to have a meal we both haven&#39;t loved!

I can&#39;t say enough about this place and the experiences we have had here over the past year. If you are looking for a place to go have a nice date night, or just a great meal, this is without a doubt the place for you!

Thank you David and the Finery for everything and we will see you soon!!!!"

The Finery is definitely a new location, so they are working out a few kinks- but how they handled all minor issues is the reason I am still going with 5 stars. I have no doubt that they will be fully 5 stars with no issues in the future. Let&#39;s start with the great- the food. Everything I&#39;ve tasted here has been excellent. The last time I went I was with a group of 9 people- and we all got different entrees (impressive I know)- and everyone loved their dishes. Several of us had leftovers, but not all. My husband enjoyed his pheasant, I loved my potato pancakes, and I loved the beef stroganoff when I ate their before. Everyone that had a meat free dish was raving about their food- so this might be a great spot for vegetarians!

Here are our minor issues and how they were handled:
One tap of beer not working on our first visit- free beer for the person who ordered it.
Reservation changed from 7-9 but they did not get the updated reservation. We had to wait a bit for the table- but they happily moved us and the owner came over to specifically chat with us.

Our service was excellent on both occasions- and I love the atmosphere and how everyone wants to go here right now! Special touch- we were out to celebrate my Mom&#39;s birthday the last time we went to The Finery and they brought her a beautiful bouquet of flowers.

I would definitely check this place out- and make a reservation in advance!"

First the restaurant itself is very comfortable, cozy and a great addition to the tri city area. Second the service was top notch and you can really tell they care about the restaurant and the food. Third the drinks wonderful and they have a decent wine list.

Now getting to the food itself, some of the meals are outstanding and some are just lacking something. Our party loved the pheasant, the bread and the deserts. Unfortunate we had some huge let downs with the beef tenderloin and the beef stroganoff. Our dinning partners agreed that the stroganoff was off this evening. The dish tasted bland and was very unappealing. After reading such rave reviews about this dish and our dinning partners insisting it was usually better than this, the beef stroganoff was a huge let down. Our waitress brought out a replacement meal without a problem and without really asking which meal we would like as a replacement. While this was nice we were then charged with the replacement that we didn&#39;t even choose. From such a fine establishment we would have never expected to be charged for a very expensive replacement meal that we didn&#39;t order. 

We ended the meal with the apple torte, which was amazing!!! This place should seriously look at selling their deserts at a bakery outpost because they are amazing.

Overall the pheasant and the deserts are amazing, and some other dishes seem to be hit or miss. With that said this is probably one of the best spots for a nicer night out in Saint Charles and we would recommend it."

Noise level however made it difficult to have conversation. Very high ceilings with nice decor. My husband had the Pheasant which he loved. Very tender and done just right. I had the cod. I forgot to order my side of potatoes and because we were on a tight timeframe I just skipped it. 
The brownie dessert was very good as were the chirros. We could have just ordered one dessert and split it. The coffee was just ordinary and we both commented it tasted like &#34;wedding&#34; coffee or something out of a big party 30 cup coffee pot. We expected a deeper taste rather than watered down. 
We will be back for the fall menu as we enjoyed but learned some lessons for next time. 
Give it a try. Eclectic and nice ambiance all in all.
Oh and Definitely try the bread with compound butter. Absolutely amazing."

The drink.  The drink.  One more time, THE DRINK... I took her recommendation and went with the jalape√±o infused vodka, cilantro, ginger syrup martini.  Twice.  And the second one was twice as nice.  It was a drink different than any other I have had.  Flavorful and spicy.  

Our food, presentation, quality and flavors were awesome.  She said seasonally the menu will change which is nice to hear.  

Dessert. ... the best I ever had.  The apple tart thingy.....  to die for, I may stop in to just have that...not kidding.   

St Chas got a goody with this one!  Oh, and.... yes, the chef walked around to make sure expectations were met.  Ummm.... yea, I guess so.. ;)"

Have gone two times now, and both visits were perfection.

Appetizers: 
Have had the charcuterie plate, peach &amp; burrata salad, artisan bread and house-made butter, fried artichoke appetizers. All were fantastic and on point.  

Was surprised at how light the fried artichokes were, you could actually taste the artichoke. Loved the peach &amp; burrata dish, have tried making it at home and it&#39;s no where near as good as from here.  Charcuterie is just straight up delish.  House made butters were very interesting and fun to try.

Main: 
Have had the trout and bouillabaisse.  Both were amazing, but the bouillabaisse stole the show.  The best I&#39;ve ever had by far, get this dish!!  My family had pheasant (if you&#39;re a meat eater, try this for sure!  The truffle really compliments the dish, my husband let me have a couple tastes.  As well as the beef stroganoff (heard great things)).

Drinks:
Their beer list is good, tried their &#34;The Spark&#34; cocktail, very refreshing.

In Summation:
The chefs are clearly incredibly knowledgable and most importantly they&#39;re clearly very passionate.  I appreciate this, keep up the good work! Both times I went it was hopping which was fun to see.

No complaints with service. Very professional.

The GM stopped by to see how we were doing which was a nice touch.  I&#39;m personally not offended that the chefs/owners did not stop by as I know how busy they were (Fri/Sat nights), and I feel that that&#39;s the managers job (unless maybe you&#39;re an uber regular and request to say &#34;Hi&#34; to the Chefs).

We will be back!"

Fried Artichoke Hearts - little to taste other than the crust - zero spices.  

Wedge Salad - good portion; blue cheese dressing would be a better choice for the wedge, not Kraft ranch dressing; added egg is a great choice. 

Bread - decent variety for 2 bucks.  

Salmon - this is where help is needed; the dill sauce added very little to the taste; the salmon was not fresh; not spiced and not cooked to perfection; should flake; garnishes were not correct choices.  

Flat Iron Steak - very good; someone knows how to prepare steak; garnish good, but potatoes so bland.  

Maybe would return - Shakou is better.  Good drink choices, but don&#39;t charge me extra for cubes on a rocks pour.  Servers need to learn the difference between bourbon and whiskey.  

These guys deserve to make it. Love the space and their attitude.  Training is needed. Music might be nice."

Greeted at the door and wished a happy birthday and then my husband was thanked for making a reservation. Server was extremely attentive but not over kill. The owner? (or manager) came by and checked on us and all tables at least 3 times throughout the meal. Again not over kill but just enough attention to make you feel like they were happy you were there and that they wanted to make sure you were happy too. 

Started with the Pheasant Pate that was excellent. I had the American bouillabaisse with perfectly cooked shrimp, prawn, mussels, white fish and scallops. My husband had the pheasant, which they are known for. After just one taste, without any black truffles, it was clear why! Both dishes were excellent, well prepared and served.

Dessert was the special banana bread pudding and almond pound cake. Both again were great and my dessert was on the house which was a pleasant surprise!

We loved this place so much my husband has asked to go back for his birthday in May and we most definitely will and we&#39;ll be asking for &#34;our table&#34; when we do"

Thanks to using my Yelp app, I found this gem of a place. The Finery is a fairly new place in St Charles opening last July.  The restaurant has a small bar area with a few tables immediately when you walk in. The dining area isn&#39;t a large space, maybe 20-25 tables, and aesthetically pleasing with dark brown wood floors and tables, black chairs, exposed brick walls and high ceilings. The staff is extremely nice, especially our server Morgan. She was very knowledgeable about the menu, made great suggestions and was pleasant and friendly. Morgan provided great service. The gentleman who seated us and is the person who would work with you to pair wines with the food was very sweet as well.  My husband and I started with the charcuterie board consisting of blue cheese, ricotta and honey, goat cheddar, lamb terrine, prosciutto and goose salumi served with grilled sourdough and cinnamon toast, homemade plum jam, grainy mustard and pickles. It was fabulous!  We also ordered the bread with two butters, which consisted of four small rolls in different varieties with a caramel apple butter and a spicy mango butter. My husband ordered the cod for dinner, which was cooked to perfection with a crispy sear, moist and flaky and served on top of cauliflower pur√©e. I had a half dozen oysters, which were very fresh served with salmon roe and cucumber ice, along with the grilled Caesar salad. The salad consisted of two halves of romaine hearts with homemade croutons, Parmesan, olive oil, anchovy and a poached egg. It was to me a deconstructed upscale Caesar salad. The husband and wife chefs are amazing and their food creations not only beautiful to look at, but full of flavor.  We ended our meal with the churros with strawberry and chocolate ganache dipping sauces. I enjoyed this neighborhood gem and will definitely be back to explore more of the menu. Great place!"

This restaurant is really a gem in the St.Charles area. The space is beautifully designed with a gorgeous bar area and separate dining area. 

I choose to sit at the bar as I was dining alone and felt very welcomed immediately. The bar tender did an amazing job of tending to diners at the bar, the local regulars, and the dining room drink orders. After receiving an excellent wine recommendation, I ordered the bar &#34;A Fine Burger&#34; and I am very impressed by the quality in my dish. 

When I paid the bill, I was thanked by name which was impressive and gave this restaurant just a little extra in terms of personalized service. Very nicely done!!!!"

I am so surprised to find a place like this in the suburbs. The food and its presentation has an obvious heir of professional chefs. You can taste all of their expertise, atleast in the dishes I tried. I will definitely head out of the city again soon just to have another meal at this place.

I ordered the cheese plate which was a perfect way to get me started with some really delicious flavors. Plus, who doesn&#39;t love cheese... amiright?? :P I also shared a salad before my main dish with my friend. Extremely well prepped salad with plenty of flavors blended into a crisp and savory starter. We had the beet salad and wow... Even the salads are thought out in detail! You can really tell that whoever handles the salads knows what they&#39;re doing when it comes to fine dining. :------)

Anyway, I decided to go with the pheasant for my main dish and was truly impressed. I Haven&#39;t had an emotional experience with food for a very long time and THIS did it for me. What a perfectly cooked treat it was! Not too much but just enough of the dish before dessert!

The apple tart was on its way to end a perfect meal and man, was it DELISH. I&#39;ve watched some fine dining food documentaries lately and this place really knows what they&#39;re doing. Trust me. 

Try it out. Definitely was worht it for me. Anyway.. goodnight yelp!"

The food was good, but not outstanding. I had the special for the night ( a German chicken, sausage, &amp; spaetzle mixture). It was good, but the chicken was a little tough. I did enjoy the spinach salad, although for $11 is was a bit small. However, the real problem was the length of time it took to receive or order. I think it must have gotten lost in the kitchen. People that came in long after us were served first. They did give us a free desert to make up for it, but I think they probably should have given us a free entree. Luckily, we weren&#39;t in a hurry to get anywhere. The other issue was I found the noise level high. They were playing some kind of a thumping base. Since we had to wait so long for our food, this constant thumping was getting very annoying. Also, it&#39;s right next to a gas station, and the headlights from the cars would occasionally shine in my eyes. The waitress was very nice. She apologized for the slow service, but probably the manager should have also done so."

The drinks were way over priced   I ordered my scotch on the rocks and then they add a $2.00 up charge for being on the rocks.  When I ask the waiters about it she said they added a little more scotch to the glass so there was an up charge.  Just figure it in the price in the price up front

We had to wait about 20 minutes at the bar, where they didn&#39;t have enough servers, and the bartender ignored us. After 10-15 minutes one in our party finally made eye contact and  got a bartender to let us order a drink.

At least after that the service improved! Our waiter was very helpful and no problems there. 

We were asked if we wanted bread, we did, and were told there was a charge... The charge was very small I think $2.00. We got a plate of 4 different small rolls and on the side, what looked like a teaspoon or less of two different butters for 4 people. Geez..  It did have a nice presentation, but if your charging for bread and butter, at least provide enough butter for the rolls. 

There was 4 of us for dinner, and our meals ranged from fair to excellent. I had the beef stroganoff.. and I have to agree with Laura. H&#39;s review.. I love a good beef stroganoff, and this was this was not it.. it was very bland, I couldn&#39;t detect any sour cream in the sauce.. It was very fair. Another dining partner ordered the special for the night which was home made pierogi&#39;s. These were an expensive disappointment, It was like 28$ for 6-7 pierogi&#39;s. Now the guys chose better, one had the flat iron steak, which we did all try, it was cooked perfectly and excellent. My husband had the salmon which he thought was very good, but with it came brussel spouts that were burnt. 

Despite the expensive pierogis, the bill for the 4 of us with drinks was reasonable.  

There are so many options out there, but we might give this a 2nd try."

Well I can tell you that they are true ratings.  My wife had the beef stroganoff which I tried a few bites and thought was excellent.  I had the seafood dish that I can not pronounce or spell.  It was a wonderful dish that had all of my favorite seafood, shrimp, scallops, fish, prawns, and mussels.  When we go back will order again.   

We had a dessert that was good as well.  

I thought the portions were perfect.  I like to eat and I went out satisfied.  Decorations are minimal but I am not there to stare at the walls, I am there to eat good food and for that they deliver.  

Side note my wife wanted a mojito and they do not serve them.  The waitress came back and said that they did have the ingredients to make one and would do so.  Bonus points from my wife.  

All in all good food.  My only negative was I can see how it could get quite loud from the acoustics of the building and that could turn some people off."

Even though I believe it&#39;s their 4th day open, everything seemed to run smoothly. It did take a while to get out drinks(most likely still working out the kinks) but they were well worth it. I had a cucumber cocktail from their menu. It was amazing. No detail was forgotten, it even had what seemed to be a homemade cucumber ice cube in it. Our group had the following dishes, peach caprese salad, charcuterie platter, artesian bread, flat iron steak, pheasant, stroganoff, salmon and trout. For dessert, we had all of the desserts on the menu.. Chocolate fondant, panna cotta, cake, and beignets. Everyone was very happy with their dishes. The risotto that the pheasant rested on was super creamy and delicious. The steak was cooked perfectly and the chimichurri was the best I&#39;ve had. The trout and salmon were too notch and cooked just right. The stroganoff was the best I&#39;ve ever tasted. The flavors exploded in the sauce. Every bite was a joy. I was surprised to see romanesco on the plate with the salmon. What a great pairing! That&#39;s a vegetable that you don&#39;t usually see. The peach caprese was also something I had never seen before and it was delicious. Even the butter that came with the bread was custom. I believe it was infused with some sort of red pepper. I could of just eaten the butter by itself! I literally don&#39;t have anything negative to say. You should definitely give this place a try.

Restaurant is beautiful inside, hands down. Staff was quite attentive on a, probably slower Sunday morning. Quite friendly overall. 

My friends and I went for a nice brunch and heard it was fabulous. And some things were... It&#39;s a hit and miss thing. 

Her eggs Benedict, which I usually abhor, was amazing. The pork? Absolutely a wonderful addition and the egg was perfect. 
The beet and mozzarella app was good, some pepper helped. The sauce and candied nuts added that zing of flavor. It just needed something...a little...i don&#39;t know, something to kick the beet itself up to compete with the flavors on the plate. 
My French toast was... Ok. I should have known better, they only had a few &#34;sweet&#34; dishes on the menu. It just didn&#39;t live up to what I expected from this type of restaurant. And... Most disappointing...NOTHING came with it. Not even syrup. No bacon or sausage or nothing. And no syrup!

The most disappointing thing was the bottomless mimosas. 18$. Heck no. And that had to be the weakest champagne ever that they used in them. Truly the OJ gave all the zip... The cheap flavorless champagne just thinned it out. 

Lots of potential here. Needs a few tweaks."

The staff is great, the wine recommendation was perfect and the food was incredible. The whole experience was exactly what we were looking for on our anniversary. The timing of the service was interesting, the server let us enjoy our wine and gave us enough time to talk about the menu and make our choices. Then each course was served at just the right time. 

As our wine was being poured they brought a crab cake compliments of the kitchen. It was excellent and we knew we were in for a good night. 

We had the fried artichoke hearts to start and they were so good we could have made that our meal. 

I ordered the 8 oz tenderloin, cooked to a perfect medium, and it was one of the best I&#39;ve had. The pur√©e (parsnip I think) was very good too. My wife had the salmon, and I didn&#39;t even get to try it, but it looked delicious. I did have one of the potatoes that came with it though and it was awesome. 

The desert was good, but not great, which we were fine with because the rest of the meal was so good. We had the brownie and the pound cake. 

I cannot wait to return and try everything else on the menu."

After arriving at our reserved time we were seated promptly.it took quite awhile for the waiter to arrive and when he did he did not tell us anything about any specials and took our drink order as well as an appetizer order. He came by a whie later and apologized about how backed up the bar was. Our appetizer arrived and we asked a passing hostess if she could check out our drinks. She promptly delivered them as waiter again apologized for the bar. Hmmm...this waiter was obviously overwhelmed or very inexperienced . 30 minutes is too long to wait for mediocre drinks. We ate our appetizer and had to flag him down for the check just to get the heck out of there. Planned on a nice dinner but had to move on to Geneva for a great meal. Hope to try again.

Went there after we stopped by Francesca&#39;s and it was too packed to enjoy. Discovered the Finery 2 blocked away via Yelp, and made the 5 minute walk in 11 degree weather.  We got the last two seats at the small bar and immediately ordered a Sazerac and an Old Fashioned. Both very good. Bartender told us about the place and suggested we have dinner. Got a nice table in about 15 minutes. The chef immediately walked over and told us about a few things on the menu and made some wine suggestions. Very warm and friendly staff. The grilled Caesar salad was great. I ordered the flat iron steak and my wife got the bouillabaisse.  Both were wonderful. Very nice atmosphere and staff. We will be back."

Hopefully they can address that.   but the food! The food! The food is great. The drinks are too. I dream about the gin thingy.. Everything we&#39;ve ordered has been perfectly prepared.

I had the pheasant and my husband had the beef cheeks....I can&#39;t say which was better because they were both just incredible.

The decor was casual but somewhat sophisticated in a sepia toned way with a hipster vibe. We were greeted by a charming host who explained there was a wine tasting dinner that had started , however we were welcome to sit in the dining room. We instead chose a high table in the bar where we had dinner and enjoyed the chill atmosphere. Our waiter was great, personable and welcoming. The menu was a little different in a refreshing way.

There were 6 of us and we all very much enjoyed the food and atmosphere. However, the Bloody Mary&#39;s were so bad we sent them back twice and eventually switched to Mimosa. The mix they used was awful. Further, one of us drank iced tea and the waiter took the glass to get a refill and 10 minutes later had to ask to get it back. 
Despite the beverage issues the service was pretty good.  I&#39;d recommend it for the food (Tortilla-egg Stack, Finery Breakfast, Sausage-polenta), which was ALL fresh and quite tasty."

They have a very unique cocktail list that will surely invite you in.   They come out with a nice palate cleanser before they begin.  We enjoyed the mushroom and goat cheese and the wedge salad, both tasted amazing, the salad had a wonderful dressing that ascended into your nasal pasages like a slight hint of horseradish, fresh bacon bits, and boiled egg wedges.  They also had a mushroom cream soup on special that was on point as well.  For dinner I had the pheasant on the truffle risotto, mind blowing stuff here.  The wife had the scallops and they had a nice sear on them.  The service was really good to. The cadence of the dinner was good.  We went really early without a reservation, it got busy fast.

On our first visit, the food was very good but the service needed definite work. 

Decided to give it another try and there were several noticeable changes, all for the better. We were warmly greeted at the host stand by a hostess and then the affable Mario took over and saw us to our table and repeatedly checked in with us throughout our meal. He was beyond friendly and made sure we were happy with everything. He is a great addition - he was seen chatting with each table and could also be seen consulting with and directing other staff and servers. 

Started with bread service with homemade butter - well worth the $2 charge - excellent variety and very tasty. Also shared a smoked acorn squash with goat cheese and arugula which was very unique and a great start.

We enjoyed an excellent whiskey sour and margarita from their imaginative cocktail list and will have to work our way through the rest of the list.

Next, our entrees arrived and were phenomenal - braised beef cheeks with spatzle. The beef was tender and deeply flavorful and the red wine and beef reduction was beyond good. The spatzle was the best I&#39;ve ever had, as it was crispy but still toothsome. The mini pickled turnips were a wonderful citrus foil to the rich beef and sauce. The other entree was a special and consisted of a braised beef loin served atop velvety polenta - another home run.

Our server hit the right balance between being attentive and giving us time and space to enjoy our meal. Again, the service has undergone a transformation and turned this visit into a wonderful experience instead of just a good meal. The chef visited tables, including ours, several times to check on our experience and food. He is clearly passionate about pleasing people and is an extremely talented chef. As is his wife, who we did not meet but was apparently responsible for our sublime spatzle.

We shared a brownie for dessert, which was no ordinary brownie. It was topped with an orange cream and had pools of delicious raspberry sauce. The brownie had a crunchy base and was a very well-conceived dish. 

No peaks and valleys in the food or service - everything was spot-on. Fantastic visit and we were already plotting our next visit halfway through the meal! Best restaurant in the area, if not far beyond."

Mario answered the phone - and invited us to come in. As a quick note, Mario is fantastic. Incredible service and passion to make sure we had a great evening. It&#39;s hard to overstate the value that he provided to our dinner adventure. 

We were able to get a table immediately, as the restaurant was approximately half filled at the time. Interesting note, they had put together a table seating perhaps 14 people or more, so this place can handle good sized parties.

Anyways, we were seated a little ways from other guests which was nice as it allowed us to have a nice conversation. I feel that the restaurant handles sound well as when I stood up to leave I hadn&#39;t noticed it was completely full (on a Thursday night).

The waitress was great and on top of taking care of us. We had the cheese platter (delicious), I had a nice steak and my Dad who had joined me for dinner had the Salmon. The food was all very well done. The cheese and meat platter I highly recommend - you won&#39;t be disappointed in this. The steak and salmon were both perfectly cooked and had a nice bed of sauce that went along with each dish nicely.

I could go on about this place - but just go there and enjoy it instead. Mario was a fantastic host and it was a delight to get to chat with him a bit. If you have that opportunity, take it.

I&#39;m taking my wife in a week or two when we get a date night. I&#39;m excited for round 2!"

First time: My party of 3 came- and had a charcuterie plate that had a few more inventive components. Nice! Server was extremely well versed on the menu and helped me with a red wine pairing, as im still an amateur. He was spot on.  We shared each others dishes: Pork Belly, Beef Cheeks, and Ratatouille. All of them were fantastic. I&#39;ve had quality ratatouille at like 6- 7 place and this was the BEST. By Far. Light as a feather. delicate flavors. Oh, I didn&#39;t like to share it...........


Second: Just as good; this time the place was rocking. Yet the service was still attentive, courses were well timed, and the salmon was delicious. well prepared. Nice visual presentation, too. I think the owner/partner/GM was there, mixing mingling and getting involved. This is a great thing to see. It shows there&#39;s support for this place top-down. Not afraid to get in the trenches with the troops.

A really really strong place in St. Charles. Hope they succeed. Ive told some friends to check it out."

The room was buzzing with servers but not one stopped to ask if we needed anything. Our waiter did not explain the menu very well, we actually listened to another waiter at a nearby table who was very informative. We were wishing we had him to take care of us.

The caesar salad was an unconventional but delicious composition with a nuanced dressing and a poached egg.  My fiance loved his skirt steak.  The desserts were sublime!

We dined on a weekday night and although the food was mostly up to its usual level, three of us ordered Cod and they were extremely salty,and the food came out unusually slow. Our waiter accidentally lost control of a glass of red wine which splashed all over my husband, me, into my purse in the floor and onto my phone, I felt so sorry for him and  I don&#39;t blame the waiter because he was new and did everything he could to make the situation better. Who I blame is the chef/owner who continued to sit at the back of the room, working on his laptop and talking to friends! We were practically the only table there and there&#39;s no way he didn&#39;t see what happened. Yet, he sat there and did nothing to help his staff or us. The waiter offered to pay our dry cleaning. We decided not to expect that of him because he tried to make our evening enjoyable. What should have happened is that  the chef should have come to the table and gave at least my husbands and my entrees for free. We had a table of 10 for goodness sakes. I&#39;m very disappointed that the chef/owner didn&#39;t support his staff in any way or take better care of customers even on a SLOW night.

One of the best meals I&#39;ve had in a while and that&#39;s saying quite a lot as I was in New Orleans last weekend eating at restaurants staffed by chefs from Top Chef on Bravo TV. The attention to detail was fantastic. From the beginning as we entered the restaurant and we were warmly welcomed, to the service and the tastiest food. We all started with something scrumptious. I had salmon poke inside of fried wonton sheets. They looked like 3 beautiful cornucopia. My husband had the beef barley soup, not a drop left in the bowl for me to try. He loved it that much. Our friends had fried artichokes with arugula and west coast oysters. Lots of smiles around the table. Then came dinner. Two of us had black ink pasta with shrimp and spring vegetables, one had pheasant and one had lamb shank with these amazing pickled onions over spetzel. I typically don&#39;t post reviews but I just needed to share. Honestly, I couldn&#39;t believe I was in St. Charles, IL. This was a meal that I would have expected in a downtown Chicago restaurant.

My friend and I came in this past Wed evening to celebrate her birthday. When we walked it, the air was on full blast and it was freezing! (my friend had to get a sweater from her car). We were greeted a minutes later by our server who was pleasant. We we looking over the wine menu, when the the server suggested that we try a tasting of the cabernet we were contemplating on ordering. We said &#34;sure&#34;, but then a few minutes later she came back and asked if we were ready to order our drinks. I guess she forget to bring us our tastings. We proceeded to order the wine anyway and it was delicious! 

I ordered the flank steak, medium. I asked for just a little pink...no blood. My friend ordered fish. When my steak came out, it was raw in the middle and my friend&#39;s fish was cold. We waited at least 15 minutes before the server finally came to check on us. During that time, we saw what looked like a tasty burger go by. We were curious as we never saw that they had burgers on the menu. When the server finally came by, my friend asked about changing her order since the cold fish grossed her out and wanted to know about the burger. They did in fact have a grass-fed burger that night as a special. We never knew about it because she failed to mention it at the beginning when she greeted us. It was disappointing that they didn&#39;t do anything for birthdays...even offer a free dessert with a candle. 

A short time afterwards, my steak returned prepared to my liking and it was very good. My friend enjoyed her burger/fries. The manager came over, apologized and bought us our wine. That was a nice gesture, but unfortunately with everything that had happened... it still put a damper on the first experience. 

I was also a little disappointed in the ambiance. It was the same layout as the previous restaurant. Sure, there are some cool light fixtures and wall paper but I thought they could have changed up the space a little and maybe had some fun music playing. The atmosphere that night was quiet and boring. I may try this place again, bring my husband and sit in the bar area (which is very small). However, it probably won&#39;t be any time soon."

Wife and I went out for date night a couple weeks ago and stayed for 3+ hours between dinner and drinks.  I had the flatiron steak entree - it was cooked a perfect medium rare.  Had the grilled Caesar salad and it was a really interesting mix of flavors (if you hate smokey taste would not recommend).

Wife had an appetizer and the wedge salad as none of the entrees appealed to her.  It is a limited menu, with  about  one entree for each of pork, beef, poultry, and fish.

Very reasonable wine prices, especially by the bottle.  By the glass selections were well conceived and not the normal grocery store brands.

Service was good considering the restaurant was full.

My only complaint was the dessert we ordered - the brownie with gelato - it was minuscule and the brownie wasn&#39;t rich - it was pretty bland.  If you are going to size an dish that small it better be very rich.

So if they can add a couple more items for some less adventurous diners and work on the desserts, the finery could hit 5 stars.  Definitely a positive addition to the St. Charles dining scene."

Chef David menu is small but very innovative. Good quality ingredients and superb plating and presentation. Labor intensive shrimp cerviche and unique pheasant dish were the stars. Nice affordable wines and well shaken martinis. Staff was great, in particular our server Sarah who knew the menu and described the food very well. Even the bus person knew the right time to clear. Small but thoughtful touches such as tiles for utensil bases and daily board for charcuterie choices. After the dinner rush David walked the room and unlike many chef/owners was both gracious and humble in front of his customers.
Some less positive but minor observations - as it is an old building with high ceilings the place was noisy, the chairs are a bit hard and uncomfortable and the banquet high for some ladies - neither of these should deter a visit however. Rookie diners will not understand paying for bread but it worth the $2  -"

The chef went to every table to ask if there were any questions and then later to thank us for dining there. Staff was well trained, did not take the plates away until everyone was finished 

The food was really amazing...the fried artichokes, peach caprese, and berry salad were incredible. Pheasant with risotto, gnocchi, and even the hamburger all better than food served elsewhere. Homemade butter, homemade pickles...wow! 

We were very impressed and feel this may be the #1 restaurant in STC! 

They have a nice happy hour that we observed since we are early diners. They handled 3 parties over 5 while we were there with smooth, nonrushed service! 

Finally, a place that can do it all!"

My go-tos are the carnitas, steak fajita tacos (wow), and shrimp diablo but I keep venturing out and am never disappointed. I&#39;ve found that at a Mexican restaurant, The salsa that comes to your table with chips is always the telltale sign of what your meal will be like. It is perfect and you can even ask for their spicy version which elevates all their food to elite, if you&#39;re a fan of spicy food but it&#39;s not necessary to taste the amazing skill that Johnny has in the kitchen.

Luckily, I live in an area that is definitely not devoid of taco establishments. I decided to try La Lomita out because of the other reviews I had read. The restaurant itself is small, but clean. The prices are more than reasonable. I noticed that the restaurant&#39;s name would be changing to &#34;Johnny&#39;s tacos&#34; soon, but so far it looked like the menu was exactly the same. 
   I ordered two steak tacos and two pork tacos for carryout to share. The tacos were made fresh of course, so it was a bit of a wait. First of all, I was surprised at how much meat were in the tacos-very satisfying. The meat was seasoned deliciously on the steak and the pork tacos. The red and green sauces that the tacos came with were also very flavorful with the right amount of kick to them. 
   I would definitely come back here and get some quick tacos to go. So far, out of my rankings during my taco explorations, this place is in the number one spot. My stomach is still exploring though, so maybe there&#39;s still a place out there that can beat them. So far, I haven&#39;t found that place."

We&#39;ve never been here, but it had the best score on Yelp in the area. 

The tacos were great and they put a ton of meat in them as well. The chorizo taco was definitely our favorite and they have a 3 taco dinner special Monday-Thursday for I believe $6.99. Tacos ran were a little over $2 a piece and they had a ton of different meat options. Their horchata was phenomenal and they give you complimentary chips and salsa as well.

Once inside, it is very clean and well kept. On Mondays they have $1.25 tacos, so I went for barbacoa, pastor (seasoned pork), chicken, and steak tacos. Usually in many &#34;Mexican&#34; restaurants all the different types of meats taste roughly the same. Not here. Each individual taco is packed with dynamic flavor and does not drown your tongue in grease. The meats are all well seasoned, and the vegetables are fresh- you can really make out all of the ingredients and spices. Comes with lime and your choice of their house hot or mild sauce to add your finishing touch! 
Complimentary chips and homemade salsa which is amazing with cilantro, lime, and onion being the star of the show with tomato in supporting role (unlike the usual which is tomato sauce with a cilantro garnish)

I got three tacos, al pastor, chicken, and steak.  All three were on point. Also you know how all mexican places have hot and mild sauce and the hot usually isn&#39;t that hot?

Torta wasn&#39;t bad, had more melted cheese than anything, but still enjoyed it.

I realize this was one bad experience but to waste 40minutes to have poor quality makes me discontent with the experience. Also the communication was poor. Somehow she charged me for 6 cups of jalapenos because when I asked her.. &#34;are thwy whole peppers or in a cup on a side&#34; she said &#34;theyre just little rings&#34;.. I said &#34;give me 6&#34;.. Miscommunication on both sides I guess. I LOVE TACO DINER BY JEWEL. ILL STICK WITH THEM. Another note.. I did eat here before when they had different owners.

I only eat out one meal per week, so I&#39;m pretty picky about what that meal is going to be. I ordered delivery....this was probably my mistake not physically going there. But their mistake because I never need to go there again. 

I ordered a carne asada burrito, chicken burrito, some nachos, and a fish taco.  I simply adore fish tacos and have a contest as to where I can get the best fish tacos. The description at Los Arcos made me really excited. When my beloved fish taco got to me, it was a soggy-oily fish in a freaking tortilla WITH NOTHING ON IT!!!!!!! I cried. I paid three bucks for THIS?!? Not cool. The nachos and burritos were TOTALLY over salted, over salted to the point that you couldn&#39;t even eat it.

Dining in gets you some complimentary chips and four kinds of salsa (with the verde being the most mild).

We arrived at about 2:45 pm, and I was crossing my fingers that the deal was still on (even though the tacos are normally only $2). It was, and we were off to the races. Chicken tacos are also priced the same if you&#39;d prefer to be fowl mouthed.

The al pastor tacos were the stars of the show, though the chicken was pretty good too. I would like to try their tostadas and gorditas too.

I&#39;ve seen some complaints about the service here. Granted, I came after the lunch rush, and the place had just a few dining in, but our server was very attentive and professional. Sorry that others have had bad experiences - this is just another data point.

As others have noticed, they are not spending their revenue on fancy furniture and fixtures. That&#39;s not to say that it&#39;s a dive, but it&#39;s just a no nonsense, good food sort of place. I&#39;d say it&#39;s like a much dimmer version of a Los Burritos Tapotios, though Los Arcos does have a nice bar which adds some class.

Anyway - highly recommended, especially on Tuesdays."

The service was decent, the place is a little on the small side, BUT holy cow the mango margarita was kick ass!!!
We also had a molcajete mar y tierra a torta and some other smaller items for our kids. I thought the torta was pretty good. It was better than decent and the best damn torta in a ten mile radius. 
The molcajete was really good. I found the sauce to be interesting and tasty. I liked it a lot but I will probably not have it again because of the sauce. I know that sounds hypocritical but as good as it was it wasn&#39;t a strong dish. Also, I think there are better items on the menu. 

I&#39;m of Mexican descent and have been hard pressed for passable Mexican food in the area. This place is great. I can&#39;t wait to go back for more. The simple things are what give me hints that this place is good. Everything is fresh and crunchy, the fries are unusually perfect, none of the chips are stale, the beans aren&#39;t oily, and the salsas are pretty damn good. I could stick a straw in that toasted pepper sauce and just drink it because it&#39;s so good. The little things insinuate that the people working here care. 
The margarita, chips and salsa are enough for me to come back for more. I&#39;m so glad to have this place by me."

In a strip mall but a lot cuter &amp; nicer inside.  Went late night about 9:10pm on a Wednesday (close at 10:00pm).  Service was very good and the waitress was friendly.  She offered some good suggestions.  Start you off with a few different complimentary salsas and chips.  Our friend said to order the spicy prawns and order early because it takes about 20 mins.  We got a half order and it was delicious, they asked us how spicy we would like them to make it too.  Order a few tacos:  steak, steak &amp; chorizo, thin sliced ribeye, tequila shrimp, battered fish and pastor.  Loved the tequila shrimp taco with avocado.  Also ordered the house margaritas on special for $6 pretty good, not overkill on sweet &amp; sour mix.  We would come back :)"

This is the worst Over priced, non authentic mexican food. What a huge dissapointment. We ordered steak tacos dinner and shrimp alcopulco taco dinner, calamari and tamales.

In what world does Mexican food come with rice and curly fries??? The shrimp tacos where not the best the shrimp were frozen prepackaged and precooked and had too much onions on them. Husband liked thebsteak tacos, im not a big fan of steak tacos so i cant speak on that, but i personally thought they were flavorless. 

For appatizer we ordered calamari which we thought were onion rings...they were so dry and semi burnt. They tasted like frozen fish sticks and that&#39;s me being generous. The tamales were dry and flavorless. First and last time ordering here. 

Only good thing was they delivered pretty quickly.

Forgot to mention, the chips weren&#39;t even home made. Guacamole was good but also prepackaged. 

2 taco dinners, guac, fake calamari and 2 tamales cost $58 with delivery fee!! At most I would have paid $22 for this so called &#34;Mexican&#34; food. (Had to spend at least $50 for them to deliver in &#34;our area&#34; about 5 miles away)

Fatty Magoos has way better tacos and home made nachos for half the price of this place."

Guacamole was very fresh and full of avocado and not fillers..., for that.... They get the two stars ..,

I forgot he had no school last Friday. So I got him up, fed him and sent him out of door for the school bus. Then he was back one minute late and said &#34;Mom, you forgot! I have no school!&#34; Oops, so I agreed to go out for lunch wherever he chose as long as on my approved list.:)

He picked tacos so we headed over as I had a $10 coupon from restaurant.com. The lobby was fine but nothing fancy. At least, I could see the soccer games on TV. And they do have WIFI available so my son was happy. 

The menu was quite extended. We got small guac and chips. My son picked his 3 tacos with Chicken, ground beef, and al pastor. My three tacos are chile relleno, beef cheek, and fish. He loved every single one he ordered. Also ate 70% of guac. I took one bit of pastor which was pretty good just a bit too sweet for me. I am pretty happy with my none-breaded fish taco which was the kind I like. Chile relleno was a small pepper for the taco tortilla which tasted great but no enough cheese stuffed in. The best one was beef cheek which was all lean meat and super tasty.

The service was a bit on the slow side which didn&#39;t bother us. They only have one nice waitress for 7-8 tables while we were eating. We were watching TV or playing with the phone while waiting for the food. She did come back a few times to make sure we were doing OK. 

The price was reasonable for the meal. With the coupon, it was actually a pretty good deal. Based on my son, he liked everything here and wanted to come back soon."

I&#39;m glad I read the previous Yelp reviews before dining here so that I was well aware that they were in the middle of remodeling. Otherwise, I would have wondered what the heck happened to this restaurant&#39;s wall and decor.

The service was stellar. Our server was really nice, took time to explain some dishes on their menu and was quick to bring everything.

We ordered Chicken Fajitas, three Carne Asada (steak) tacos, Jarritos grapefruit soda and Pico de Gallo. The chicken and steak were okay and just wasn&#39;t seasoned or salted enough to make the dish flavorful. What made my tacos decent enough though was adding the green salsa dip and pico de gallo. The downside was that almost half of my first taco had fatty steak pieces. I like that they don&#39;t skimp on the ingredients and as a result, my tacos were huge. The dishes came with complimentary tortilla chips and three types of salsa dips (mild, medium and hot). The chips, grapefruit soda and pico de gallo were excellent. Just a warning though, the jalapeno peppers in the pico de gallo are HOT. After a couple of small bites, I had to down almost half my soda and blow my nose. I would recommend ordering it and asking them to put just a little bit of jalapeno peppers.

They have a $10 Restaurant.com certificate available, so you can use that if plan on ordering at least $15 worth of food.

I can&#39;t fully say I&#39;d recommend this restaurant yet. I have to try their other entrees to see if they are better than the steak tacos and chicken fajitas that we ordered."

Great tacos, with original offerings like the &#34;Los Arcos&#34; style plates, sandwiches, and seafood specialties. &#34;Los Arcos&#34; fajitas are just about all I need to satiate my Mexican food appetite. Throw in some complimentary chips and salsas (plural, they serve at least three) and a couple President Margaritas and you&#39;re pretty much guaranteed a post-meal nap. Prices seem a tad above market, but the quality food typically quells any complaints. Service can get backed up with a large crowd, but they typically maintain their composure, uphold hospitality, and roll with the punches.

Today Arturo (I think he is the manager) remembered what had happened(2 weeks after the other order) and made sure I wasn&#39;t charged for my order today. I went back to my office and to my surprise a few minutes later, the receptionist told me someone was here with my &#34;order&#34;. I was confused given I already had my food but decided to go see what was up. Arturo was waiting in the lobby with another 3 tacos.

Ordered a lemonade and saw that each glass was being made fresh (from lemons, sugar, water and ice) and shaken well (like a martini) at the small bar area inside (no worries about High Fructose Corn Syrup with that!).Ordered the chicken tacos dinner (since my first visit wanted to try a &#34;basic&#34; soft flour shell) (3) that came with rice (which was very tasty by itself) and refried beans that were nicely presented in a small bowl made out of corn tortilla instead of plopped on the plate (food presentation is everything -sorry I didn&#39;t take a pic, next time &#39;cause there will be one.) The taste was as great as it looked/smelled! The chicken was flavorful and hearty portion of it in each taco.
The location itself is kind of hidden and hard to find if you haven&#39;t been before (in small strip mall behind a Mobile and a Arby&#39;s), but once found it a small culinary hidden treasure."

The staff is very friendly. The food is plentiful and delicious. The house margarita was just okay.  Chips were hot and fresh. The salsas are tasty. 

Can&#39;t say I&#39;ve ordered a lot of different items from their menu. I have had the gorditias and tacos. Both with chicken. The chicken is for the most part white meat. Very tender and not greasy like some places can be. The pork tacos are okay. 

The B/F likes the steak tacos. The meat is marinaded really well. 

I like that the rice has potato in it. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve had it like that b4 at a Mexican restaurant. 

It&#39;s nice that they have late night hours. Not to many suburban places do.

I never been so angry about a restaurant. I ordered for delivery via Grubhub, but two hours later I still had no food.  (I live about a mile and half away). After I called their number, carefully enumerating my frustrations about not  getting my order, I was promptly ... hung up on!  

About fifteen minutes later I did get a call from the delivery person who asked me in very broken English about where I lived. WTF? I ordered electronically -- they should have already had my exact address, clearly spelled out in print.  Repeating myself multiple times, we both struggled to wade through a language barrier as thick as a greasy pool of rancid tortilla lard while I gave him directions to my house (seriously ... their delivery person doesn&#39;t have a GPS?)  And, yes, I finally received my order after only two and a half hours. But I am angry with myself that I accepted the delivery.

Oh ... and don&#39;t count on Grubhub to help you out.  When I tried to complain via their purported 24-hour support, their little cartoon smiley characters simply told me &#34;Hmmm ... we&#39;re not sure why your order hasn&#39;t arrived.&#34; and indicated &#34;We&#39;re on it! We&#39;ll let you know what we find out as soon as we can.&#34; I haven&#39;t heard a word from them yet. Don&#39;t trust little smiley faces."

My food was ready quickly since I called in it, but I waited almost an additional 10 minutes as they rang up other customers, or fixed what I asssumed to be a glitch in the system, and guess what? I had absolutely no problem waiting. My problem came when I asked about an additional sauce and received no answer as if I hadn&#39;t asked the question. Ok, sometimes I speak a little softly, so I asked the young lady did she hear me? She looks at me and says &#34;yes&#34; oohokay Sooo, why didn&#39;t you acknowledge me? So I ask again, she says she gonna charge me. I reiterated to her that I just spent $40 on food, I&#39;m asking for 1 additional sauce. I&#39;m fine with a no,my issue is the additude that came with the no. It was uncalled for. Also, my sister called in the order,  and had a drink. I had to ask them for the drink. If I handt asked Im doubtful I would have received it. 

In the end she gave me the sauce, but reiterated that it was just this time. 

After that service believe me.....there won&#39;t be a next time! (For me at least)


P.s. If you don&#39;t care about the service, I really enjoyed the lengua taco, very tender! My sister loves this place and says when she eats in the service and food are very good, so it could be, she was just having a bad day....who knows?"

Fair is fair and I knew a second chance comeback round was an order. This time I entered at 12:30 noon time today on Christmas Eve and was waited on by the same server from my previous experience. I can tell she remembered me but she did not let that get in her way making sure my dining experience was excellent. I ordered pretty much that exact same breakfast plate as the last time. It was absolutely delicious like I knew it would be.

Of course you are wondering why I decided to go back. For starters I was convinced the taqueria suffered a moment of bad luck. I totally get that and I give people second chances before making a permanent descision. The server was on point with coffee refills, upselling desserts, checking in if I need more tortillas. She clearly was in winning me over mode. She conquered every aspect I questioned in my mind.

Would I comeback for a third visit? Yes of course. Onward and Upward is the motto and the past is the past.

Their guacamole is better than the places that do the table side service. I got two vegetarian tacos with corn tortillas. You have a choice between cilantro/onion or lettuce/tomato on your tacos. I recommend the cilantro because it goes good with the lime they give you. They do not need any salsa or hot sauce on them. I use to work with a guy from Mexico and he said that his mom use to make corn tortillas early in the morning and they would put butter on them and eat them throughout the day for snacks because they were so good. These corn tortillas taste as good as the ones this guy use to talk about.

Pros - Tacos are filling and tasty, while the sour cream was a buck, at least it was a good size, Jamica was good.

Cons - For some reason the guacamole tasted funny, but then I ate some chips without and maybe they were the funny taste culprit?, place is a little pricey without a coupon, they said if I ordered the Horchata (which I originally asked for) it would taste bad because they were low on it (at about 5 o&#39;clock on a Sunday), and they forgot my flan (which I discovered before I left since places always mess up my order so I check before I leave.)  O...almost forgot at a previous time I came in here and a lot of prices were higher than what their website said.

All and all it has it ups and downs.  I might some back, I might not.  The tacos were pretty good.

Edit: In response to the response...It&#39;s nice that you home make your Horchata, but you should make enough that you aren&#39;t going to run out before dinner starts.  Also I know how to guide myself around the internet and make sure I look at the proper location.  To insinuate that I just blindly went to the wrong spot is insulting.  According to you your prices are &#34;constantly updated&#34; so is it possible that one time when you were raising your prices again you did it at the store before the website?  And just how often are you raising your prices that you need to constantly update the web page?  I was on the rail as to whether I would be back or not, but you helped me make my decision, so thanks for that."

Haven&#39;t tried the drink specials since I&#39;ve mostly come here for lunch, but I cannot recommend this place enough.  Don&#39;t even think about going back to Burrito Loco, Pepe&#39;s, or Taco Bell once you&#39;ve tried the food here."

This is my second review on this great little restaurant. Actually this is really not a review, but a complement to the owner of this restaurant. My wife and I just got home from eating at your wonderful little restaurant. The two gentlemen who were the servers this afternoon are excellent they work well together and are very attentive to your customers. My compliments to the cooks in your kitchen, also are very hard-working and turn out some of the most tasty food I have ever eaten. The portions of food that come to the table are very plentiful and reasonably priced. Your menu, what can I say but it&#39;s huge and each item looks better than the next. The chips and salsa that comes to the table, free of charge are the best I have eaten at any Mexican restaurant.

This afternoon my wife and I tried the ceviche Cancun, oh my God it was wonderful !!
The fish tacos, the best I&#39;ve ever had, and the fajitas Los Arcos which are to die for and the portion was so big I brought half of it home. Also had your margaritas they too are awesome ......... &#34;they are so good LOL they will kick your butt&#34;

To the owners of Los Arcos my compliments to you on having one of finest little restaurants, I have ever eaten in and a staff that is very attentive to your customers. Please do not change anything about your restaurant because everything about it is five stars.

Me and my Girlfriend walked in and were definitely excited, but disappointed overall. Here is what I liked and didn&#39;t like. 

Pros: 
-Chips and salsa were delicious and fresh
-Nicely decorated 
-Friendly Staff
-Draft Dos XX Special 

Cons
-Waitress wasn&#39;t to familiar with the menu (maybe she was new) and seemed to have a lot of trouble with the overall order and service. A lot of confusion
-Only got 1 water for me and my GF
-Took over 10 min to get our draft beer and Margarita
-Had to ask for silver wear when it should have already been available for us 
-The corn tortillas in my tacos were under cooked 
-The steak also tasted funny and dry. 

Overall my experience was fair and may give it another chance. But for now, wish it could have been better . So that&#39;s why I give it only 2 stars."

The food is flavorful and delicious. I seriously cannot get enough of their chile relleno tacos. I took one bite, and I was immediately smitten. It is so good, it&#39;s the only thing I ever end up ordering from there. I&#39;m sure many of their other items are fantastic but I can&#39;t seem to get enough of their chile relleno tacos. Go try them! ANYWAYS...let&#39;s talk about service. Service has always seemed to be an issue, in pretty much every single instance we have picked up from there. Everytime we do pick up, our food is never ready by the time we get there to pick it up. I&#39;d get there to pick up the food, and every single time I was asked to take a seat and wait at least 15 minutes for them to cook the food. Doesn&#39;t that defeat the purpose of pickup?...Furthermore, delivery seems to be slow. I live 5 minutes away from Los Arcos. We ordered delivery online one night and the confirmation email stated our food would be delivered by 6:30. Our food did not arrive until 7:15. We were a little irritated by it, since we were so frickin hungry. But all was forgiven after we ate our food lol. I had my chile relleno tacos and my boyfriend had a steak burrito dinner. 
Overall, would I recommend going to Los Arcos? Sure. At least in terms of food. They have an extensive menu. There&#39;s something for everyone. If you don&#39;t like one thing, there&#39;s many other things you can try. But to be honest, if it weren&#39;t for those damn chile relleno tacos I&#39;m clearly obsessed with, I don&#39;t think I would keep coming back since service does not seem to be a strong point of theirs..."

Everything about this place is awesome!  I&#39;m REALLY picky about mexican food and this place has the best authentic mexican food I&#39;ve had outside of the city.  Not only do they have delicious food ( I&#39;ve tried multiple dishes, all so yummy) but their drinks are AMAZING &amp; HUGE! My girlfriends and I stopped in on a Saturday night for a few drinks and to our surprise they dimmed the lights and had a dj and disco ball!  That just made it so much better.  We had a blast! Last night ( Friday) my husband and I went on a double date here and again we had so much fun. This time they had karaoke. We didn&#39;t participate but it was fun to watch. This place is not fancy,  but I like that because it&#39;s comfortable and relaxed. The best part.... the prices! I&#39;m talking, way low prices for way good food and drinks AND they are really generous with their liquor. The drinks are pretty strong. There is an adorable bald man( maybe the owner or manager) who is so incredibly nice. He goes out of his way to make sure you are happy &amp; makes the BEST sangria I ever had in my life. That is not an exaggeration. So, after 2 Sangrias and 2 Mango Margaritas rimmed with chili powder... I am writing this review the next morning because I seriously cannot wait to go back.  Maybe today just for some hangover food haha.  Oh, and I also have to add in here that we have ordered here for delivery and the food tastes just as good at home as it does at the restaurant. So on nights where we just feel like staying in... this will still be our go to spot. We are so glad we found this place. We will definitely be back again &amp; again!"

What a tiny gem in a strip mall. The guacamole was outstanding. The waitress was very friendly. We had the fajita served in a hollowed pineapple with onions green pepper and grilled pineapple it was amazing. And don&#39;t get me started on the margaritas. A huge berry margarita with fresh blueberries and blackberries floating in it. That alone is worth the trip. Great food, great drinks, great service."

My daughter had the taco dinner and I my usual. The beans and rice are delicious. The waiter though was a little slow but he was nice.  The guy at the register when I ordered take out was very friendly and helpful. He was not there when we dined in.  I definitely will be back.

The food was pretty good. I think I will order the al pastor next time as the steak was just ok. The rice and beans were bland, but not terribly so. My only real complaint was that there were two giant chunks of fat in my tacos that were inedible and i spit them out. I will be back, but will try other things. Great prices on decent food. I will update when I go back."

If you blink you might miss Los Arcos (it&#39;s located behind the Mobil on 75th and Woodward.  Overall opinion: exceptional food, OK service, but kind of a poor space for a restaurant.

Let me start with the food, which I would actually give 5 stars.  To start, they have a full bar and a really nice selection of tequilas.  The waitress was pretty familiar with all the tequila, and had several recommendations.  After drinks we decided to start with chips and gaucamole.  Gauc comes in 2 sizes- small and large.  The small is enormous, there must be 2 or 3 avocados in the small.  It&#39;s not made tableside, but it&#39;s incredibly fresh.  Only knock was that there was a little too much cilantro.  Otherwise it was outstanding.  Chips are also served with a trio of salsas (mild, medium, and hot).  All were excellent.

For dinner I had their special skirt steak with chorizo and cheese (Arrachera Los Arcos), and my girlfriend had the chicken taco salad.  The skirt steak was outstanding.  I asked for it cooked medium, and it came out perfectly.  It&#39;s smothered in chorizo (very spicy) and cojito cheese.  It&#39;s served with rice and beans, and tortillas.  This was an excellent dish.  My girlfriend loved her taco salad- what stood out to her was that the chicken and beans were in the bottom of the bowl, while the lettuce and tomato were on top, keeping it from getting soggy.  Overall, the salad was really good too.

Biggest drawback to the place is that there&#39;s no ambiance.  It&#39;s a big room, and you can see out through the windows.  We were here on a Saturday night and it was freezing out.  Every time the door opened, we got hit with a blast of cold air.  Fortunately I found out they do delivery in addition to carry-out, so you&#39;re in luck if you don&#39;t want to eat here.  Overall pretty happy, I&#39;d come back to eat when it&#39;s warmer out, or I&#39;d get it delivered."

I&#39;ve eaten Mexican food many places across the country, from Texas to Southern California and even in Mexico itself.  Los Arcos has some of the best steak tacos and carne asada I&#39;ve ever had!  Anything else I&#39;ve ever had there has been excellent, too, but I almost always default to the steak tacos or carne asada.  Other dishes of note: char-broiled chicken, chorizo tacos.  A lot of people like their Al Pastor and fish tacos, too, but they&#39;re not my favorite.

Their chips are usually nice and fresh, and their salsa verde is fantastic!  The guacamole is pretty good, too!

The staff is very friendly (Sharon, Carmen, Annuncio).  The service is a bit slow at times, especially if it&#39;s in the middle of the lunch rush, but the quality of the food more than makes up for that.

My one very minor complaint is that sometimes we have to wait a long time for chips and salsa.  I feel like that should be something that they bring to the table when they bring the menus.  Also, sometimes I have to wait a while for my water--bad news when I&#39;m chowing down on the chips and salsa!

All this talk of food!  I&#39;m starving now!  Off to Los Arcos!"

However-
There was karaoke the night we went and it was really, really awkward at first. It didn&#39;t really get much better as the night went on. 

Our server was great at first, but after we had our food it took awhile to get a second drink. It took even longer to get the check. 
When we eventually got our check, the specials were not priced correctly. We ended up having to send our check back a total of three times. SO frustrating when you just want to leave. 

I would probably give this place another try. I&#39;m going to chalk it up to an off day."

We were going for lunch so groupon was a no go.  The menus was confusing.  Lunch combos did not include the pictured tacos.  
I thought the food was decent once we got passed the confusing menu.  I ended up with the combo taco and my wife had the steak tacos (the name escapes me).  We couldn&#39;t get enough of the curly fries with my combo (replacement for beans and rice).  Once again the shells were not home made.  Good would have much better and I would definitely rate it higher if it had more than the store brand flour shells, which were double stacked because they fall apart so easily.  
I will make a trek back to Chicago soon to antique taco.  They make their own shells.  It makes a huge difference!  To sum it up, I like this place but would suggest that they start making their own shells.  I would frequent this place more often once this happens.  Also would suggest making the menu more straight forward so to attract and retain more customers so they don&#39;t feel like it&#39;s bait and trap.  If you want the tacos pictured than you have to order 3 or 4 of the same taco. Ada first time customer I would have like to try different tacos pictured and not have to order 7 tacos to try a fish and a steak taco.  Just a suggestion.  The taco pastor is $1.50 on tues and Wednesday&#39;s which is a great deal for a good taco."

I&#39;m always on the hunt for good Mexican food and am tired of fighting with Pepe&#39;s about whether they&#39;ll honor my coupons (they once told me I couldn&#39;t use one because it was marked &#34;Not valid on major holidays&#34; and it happened to be SWEETEST DAY. COME ON).

We ventured to Los Arcos on a frigid Wednesday night. Based on how well the online menu was designed, I was expecting the place to be a little more upscale, but no biggie. Some of the best food I&#39;ve had has come from run-down strip-mall joints. 

Since we had $20 to spend, we ordered the nachos appetizer, chile relleno plate and two tacos (chile relleno for my  husband and pastor for me based on Yelp recommendations). The nachos arrived quickly and were delicious. I could almost hear the chips sighing under the weight of all the toppings. Since my husband is a vegetarian, the waitress offered to substitute avocados for meat on the nachos, even though that wasn&#39;t listed as a choice on the menu. We really appreciated that. We topped the nachos with the homemade hot sauces that were brought to our table. I love hot things, and the homemade red hot sauce had my scalp prickling - yowza! 

Next up were our tacos and the chile relleno. The pastor taco was delicious and the pork was just slightly crunchy - thanks for the recommendation, Yelpers! My husband scarfed down his chile relleno taco also, so that must have been good (he didn&#39;t offer me a bite because he was too busy wolfing it down). We were full by the time we got to the chile relleno plate, so we took most of it home. The few bites I managed to eat were tasty, though. My only gripe is that the rice on our platter seemed to have been sitting around for quite a while as it was quite clumpy. 

Los Arcos is nothing fancy, but the food is solid and we&#39;ll definitely be back!"

We ordered a taco dinner, we were asked if we wanted lettuce and tomato, we said yes.  They were added as extras on the bill.  On a previous visit I was offered more tortillas to finish my meal only to find $1.20 extra on the bill. It&#39;s not a lot of money but it is not standard practice to charge and also not to mention the extra fees when taking the order. Otherwise the staff provides good service and the meals are good.  In any taco, lettuce, tomato and onion are part of a the taco otherwise you would just call it a tortilla and a filling."

Same 5 star service and food as before (see my previous reviews).  Today we had the veal medallion special and the pork chops (with bell peppers).  The veal amounted to veal picatta.  It was very good.  When we ordered the pork chops we asked for &#34;no pink&#34;.  The two largish boneless chops were cooked perfectly.  No pink but still some moisture.  That&#39;s hard to do.  Empty plates were removed promptly.  Our server (didn&#39;t get her name) checked from time to time if everything was OK.  It was.  With the bread, salad and sides of pasta we were too stuffed for dessert.

Note to the owners: A double espresso should only be about 2 oz. of liquid.

I saw one Yelp reviewer that said something like if you want better Italian you would have to go to Naperville or Chicago.  As a L.O.N.G time resident of the Naperville area, I can tell you that LDV Plainfield is better than any Italian you will find in Naperville.  And that includes Rosebud and the two Francesca franchises.

Again I&#39;m repeating myself but if we lived closer we would be regulars.  What would really be the cat&#39;s meow would be if LDV opened a place in Naperville."

For lack of better words, nothing was &#34;Authentic Italian&#34; or &#34;Di Casa&#34;(house-made, freshly made). From the tacky Italian American ambiance, to the inexperienced staff, and ending with food that one may say is just edible. I have every right to express my feelings in this manner due to the fact, that I am 100% percent Italian on both sides, My father from Palermo, Sicily, and my mother&#39;s side a mix of Northern and Southern Italy (Roma e Puglia) raised speaking, reading, writing the language, knowing the culture from North to South Of Italy, understanding the importance of my culture and it&#39;s authentic cuisine, not to be confused with &#34;Italian American&#34; which should be non-existent.

I recently moved to the Chicago-Plainfield area from the Bronx, NYC (Little Italy).  In hopes to find food close to home, I started to explore my local restaurants, naturally beginning with my own cultural. 

To make this less lengthy- let&#39;s just get into the food. To start with the menu, which was all in Italian made me believe I might of found a hidden gem. Until I stumbled upon a few spelling and grammatical errors in the wording of the menu. This lead me to believe the person who created the menu must of not been Italian and/or used Google translate incorrectly(insulted). Pizza was no better than buying a frozen RedBarron pizza to pass it off as &#34;flatbread&#34;. Calamari way over cooked and mushy, the ravioli were watery, overcooked and metallic tasting (this happens when product isn&#39;t fresh and frozen, store bought). Now the bruschetta, one of the staple delicacies to any true italian, a perfect mix of everything secret to us, tomatoes, basil, garlic, bread, olive oil. I always ask myself &#34;how can you mess up such a delicate yet simple dish!&#34; well folks the answers is simple, they messed it up. The bruschetta was so cold you might as well of used the tomatoes as ice cubes, continuing with the tomatoes which were the wrong kind of tomatoes used(again probably due to lack of knowledge of true authentic Italian food), even my wife who isn&#39;t Italian quickly pointed out that the bruschetta was not authentic before I could even utter a word. 

Needless to say I wont mention much more, you get my drift. If your looking for an edible meal and its a short shot of a drive for you, go ahead and see for yourself, God bless you. I for one will never recommend this establishment to anyone as authentic Italian food."

THe room was of average size and tables spaced  in a fashion where you did not get a crowded in feeling yet the restaurant was packed to the gills, bar area included. Menu choices were varied and price point apropos. Other than chicken items or pasta items the other entrees were in the low to mid 20.00 dollar range. On the website and menu they state that all food is cooked to order and be prepared for a little wait once food is ordered because of that. We did wait longer than normal but nothing that is an issue, especially when the food that comes out of that kitchen is so fresh and tasty. Even the house salad was over the top good and that is a basic garden salad. THey had at least three choices of veal on the menu which is something not typical in a suburban restaurant.. 
THE personnel are very knowledgeable and they are vigilant in their duties   all the busboys were constantly refilling water glasses   removing dirty plates   replacing  utensils etc. Dinnerware and glassware was sparking clean. Our waitress was very helpful without being intrusive and catered to our every needs    also commenting on what is especially good on the menu. One of her recommendations that we took was the tiramisu. She stated it is made daily in house and that it was very good   So I ordered it and it was the very best  tiramisu that I have ever  had in my life   a very very fresh tasty rendition of that Italian classic desert.
SO why only 4 stars and not 5 you ask?    Well we had reservations for 5pm   a party of 9 and my wife and I arrived at 445. At that time the  restaurant was empty and we could see the big table set up that was designated for our party, all setup   water glasses even filled etc  The hostess refused to  seat us until the entire party was on site  Even after I advised here that we all live in Plainfield and that everyone was on their way  confirming that we would all be there, she would not seat us    I found that to be extremely annoying and not customer  friendly at all . My experience took a nose dive at that point., however once seated and all of the above kicked into play the reminder of the night was pleasant....
Definitely a fine place to have dinner and well worth returning too...."

The bussers were really lacking good etiquette. Pulled a plate from our table with food still on it without asking if we were finished and carried said plate throughout the restaurant looking for more to clear, while we had dirty empty plates left on our table. When asking to have a meal boxed up, another busser proceeded to take a plate of pasta and pour it onto a plate of salmon right at the table before taking it to the kitchen to box it up. The restaurant really seemed understaffed and not very well trained.  On the other hand, the food was very good with large portions. The tiramisu is great! 

Really subpar service for the quality and price of the restaurant."

Have been there 3 times in 2 years. The first time was not the same quality as Lemont, then went with a large group from work this past February and it was great. The 3rd time was last night for our anniversary and it was not good. We always get the strip steak with pasta and salad. We order medium rare in which it was only in the middle and overcooked on the ends and the sauce tasted bitter. Salad was good! But for $83 we didn&#39;t go there for a salad. So it&#39;s a hit or miss. Sorry La Dolce but you are not living up to  your reputation you had in Lemont. Our server was excellent so we left her a good tip because it wasn&#39;t her fault, shes not the owner or cook. Won&#39;t be going back."

There are almost no other restaurants in the area where you can get any type of food of this quality, especially the fish.  Think about that for a minute.  You are in Plainfield that has a total of 3 real restaurants - Sovereign and Capri Sogno being the other two.  I had the walleye pike last night and it was phenomenal.  I challenge anyone to name another restaurant in the area, aside from the two other I mentioned, where you can get actual seafood that is properly prepared.  That&#39;s right, you can&#39;t.  Plainfield is lucky to have this restaurant and if you are in the mood for higher-end Italian food and you aren&#39;t up for going to Naperville or Chicago, this is a good place to go."

The bruschetta appetizer was fresh and very tasty. The wine was very nice. A Chardonnay I have never tasted. Should look up the name! When I ordered the veal scaloppine piccata I asked to have the tomato removed from the recipe. They made it the traditional way and it was excellent, but expensive.
The tiramisu was overly swimming in marscapone and low on cake. Seemed out of balance. My friends and husband loved their dinners.  
My husband commented that this was the best Italian restaurant we have been to during our visits to the area.
We will keep it in mind for our next trip.

We have a wide range of tastes in food - and there was something for everyone. The menu had a great variety of items, from traditional to a bit more creative, and each one looked and tasted good. The polenta appetizer was delicious. My 8-year-old niece - who is somewhat finicky - ate almost every bit of her food. LDV does have a Kid&#39;s Menu, and the hostess asked us if we needed one.

My mother made reservations beforehand - which I recommend. The restaurant is relatively small, so there were only a couple of tables left. We appreciated the fact that they informed us that the table was near the kitchen - which didn&#39;t bother us. The restaurant is located in a strip mall, and the awnings do make it look a bit like an Applebees. Inside, however, it is decorated nicely and features photos of Italian cultural icons. As someone new to this area, I would be likely to bring a date here.

The service was also impressive. Our server knew the menu and was very attentive. She never let our drinks go empty without asking if we needed refills. At the end of the meal, she and a food runner wrapped up our extra food without complaint. Everyone had enough left for lunch or dinner the next day.

For a restaurant of this quality, the price was right. For a huge bowl of pasta, my dish cost $16. This included a tasty house salad - served to the table - and fresh bread. We did not drink any alcohol, but the wine list looked to be a good one.

If your plan ahead and make reservations, this is a great choice!

NOTE: This is strictly a DINNER restaurant, as they usually open at 4 p.m. Check the hours on the website."

Taylor not only handled her &#39;particular&#39; order details down to the letter, but did so with a smile, going that extra mile to ensure Mom was happy. The caphper was when at the end of the meal, completely on her own without any requests from anyone at our table, brought over a candle-topped slice of Tiramisu and sang a birthday song for Mom.

Unfortunately, that was not the case. When we first walked in, the place was extremely noisy, it was almost like being in a loud bar. The appetizer was not very tasty, in fact it was kind of burnt. When we received the main entr√©e, it was very bland, and somewhat watery. We had to ask our server on two different occasions to refill our drinks, and when one of the busboy came along to take our dirty plates, he placed the dirty plates he had already from other tables on to the plate on our table before he took it away. Quite frankly, I don&#39;t enjoy looking at leftover food from other people&#39;s plate put on my table before being taken away. On a positive note, the tiramisu was good! $85 later ($97 with tip) and we&#39;re out the door. If you&#39;re looking for a nice quiet restaurant with good food, I would advise you to go somewhere else. I only wish that somebody would have told me about this before we wasted our time at this restaurant. I really hate to sound negative, but my time is very limited with my Wife, and to say that I was disappointed would be an understatement."

So this all equals at least an A-Ok rating, right? Wrong. Because the minute we stepped into the bathroom before leaving, I wished I hadn&#39;t eaten there. Not only was it dingy and dirty, but there was urine and food crumbs all over the floor.

People still sitting in restaurant, people drinking and being served at the bar so seemed reasonable to still be served.  If I owned a restaurant and 3 people walked in, and one of my employees turned them away, they would be fired on the spot.

We had calamari as an appetizer which was cooked very well and the sauce complemented the dish very well. I also liked how they served the salad that comes with every meal. The salad was brought to the table family style and already dressed. Additionally, everyone in our party loved their food. My only complaint was how the food was &#34;auctioned&#34; when it was brought to the table. At a restaurant that fancy, I did not expect to have a runner standing at one end of our large party announcing what dish she was holding and then waiting for one of us to raise our hands.

We had very long waits between the courses. All the seafood was overcooked. One of the shrimp was not deveined. It grossed my husband and my daughter out to the point that they didn&#39;t want to finish their shrimp meals. The waitress talked to the manager and we waited over 20 min for the manager, Debbie. She did take it off the bill and gave us a dessert to take home. The best part of the meal was my daughters chicken breast. It was moist on the inside and crispy on the outside.

She was correct but should have given specific selections especially for the type of restaurant this is. Also, it is not the patrons fault if the kitchen is short staffed.

The restaurant certainly has nice atmosphere, but that&#39;s where the positive feedback ends.  Our server was distracted and inattentive, and didn&#39;t even bother to outline the daily specials when she brought our menus.  We only noticed the specials on the chalkboard after we had placed our orders - too late.  Prices for bottled wine were within reasonable limits, but I&#39;m sorry, the main dishes are definitely not a good value.  Calamari that was supposed to come with marinary sauce actually came with shrimp cocktail sauce - ???  Linguine with clams was a pile of muck that seemed to have a can of chopped clams dumped on top.  Too big a portion, too expensive, and too many clams.  The caesar salad was too heavy and, again, &#39;mucky&#39; with too much dressing.  Poor value for the money - won&#39;t be going back."

The service was good, most items are under $20 so I don&#39;t know how the one review spend $220 for 6 people - it had to be a lot of liquor.  We have been there multiple times and never had a single complaint.  The beef ravioli (I order it with meat sauce rather than marinara) is excellent and plentiful ($14.95) and the Fetticini Alfredo is the best I have ever had."

This place is fantastic from the atmosphere to service to the food. We&#39;ve been four times and each time it&#39;s been as good as the last.

We were seated right away, and the staff very was attentive but not bugging us as we were sort of himming and hawing on what to drink and an appetizer. Server Eric would timely look over waiting for his que.
Ordered the calamari which was dry and overcooked...Not too bad, but I wished I had ordered the stand by bruschetta. I had the Salmone della Casa, and my friend had the Linguine con Frutti del Mare. We both thoroughly enjoyed our entree&#39;s.  
An added bonus to our dinner was a band that started up around 7:00 or 7:30. The best part was the band rocked, but the restaurant does a great job of keeping the sound form ruining your dining experience. 
I have eaten at several of the Francesca restaurants, and our dining experience here was very good and consistent throughout the group."

I may have overlooked this place except my friend and her family frequent this spot and told me they were authentic. We came here to celebrate the coming of her new baby and it was a real delight. The service was 5-stars. We had a challenging group of family with us who were picky, asked lots of questions, and would have been considered &#34;difficult&#34; for any seasoned server. Our server took it all in stride, made suggestions, answered questions, and was upbeat, friendly, and kept our water and wine glasses full (minus Ms. Preggo&#39;s glass!) 

The food was excellent with most of the group ordering one of the fish entrees. It was all fresh, cooked just right, and tasty. My friend and I traveled to the Cinque Terre last year and agreed the style was similar to what we had in our quest for authentic Italian cuisine along the Mediterranean. Highly recommend!"

Last night, we brought out of country guests with us, bragging about the food and service. While the food was its usual great, it has been by far the worst service we ever received. Took more than an hour to receive our entrees and this is after we had to ask our server twice to check status. Where she promised it would be out in a minute (which turned into another 15 minutes) and then ended up blaming the new trainees in the kitchen. Meanwhile, all tables around us have been served. The bus girl however was one of the BEST we&#39;ve ever experienced and we made sure she received a separate gratuity from us.

They did not keep the waters full on the table, neglected for most of the meal. Messed up three out of five dishes. Servers were rude and combative. 

Caprese salad is just huge watery tasteless tomatoes, and uses cheap olive oil.  

Ingredients are cheap. The pastas don&#39;t come with nearly enough sauce. 

If you have no other option go here... But for the price you can go to a handful of MUCH better restaurants with SIGNIFICANTLY better service in the area."

I understand that you will be asked to wait on a Saturday night without a reservation.  I was told there would be a wait of 20-30 minutes for a party of two. While we waited, two separate parties of three came in without reservations and were told 30-35 or 40 minutes.  Both parties were seated within fifteen minutes of their arrival.  After waiting 50 minutes, a party of four came in, again without a reservation, and were told 20-25 minutes.  They were seated five minutes later.  When I asked the hostess she said it would be just another few minutes because they were waiting for a party of two to finish up and wanted to seat the bigger parties first.  I&#39;m very unhappy that we couldn&#39;t have been seated at one of those four seat tables. I&#39;m also very unhappy that not once during our 50 minute wait, was anything said to us.

I&#39;ve had good experiences here but my last visit would make my malpractice rates skyrocket because someone needed to be euthanized after my visit. 

Made a reservation for my party arrived on time and had to wait 25 minutes so they could sit me in the corner of the rental room. Because we were in the dungeon no waiters would visit the table. My &#34;rations&#34; were never refilled and it took an hour to place my order. 

When I finally found a guard (busboy) he alerted the warden (manager) and we got the check and escaped the Naperville Alcatraz.

The food is always spot-on, and it&#39;s our favorite place to take guests when they&#39;re in town and we don&#39;t want to go far.

The pizza is good, and there&#39;s always a rigatoni dish that hits the spot. The menu changes frequently, so unfortunately when you find something you like, it might be a while before you see it again. The mushroom risotto is a standout in my mind. The bar is pretty good too.

Downsides: Sometimes the seating sucks. Time and again there are booths available and we get seated directly in front of the kitchen, where servers and bus boys wedge themselves against our table to get by. We love the cheesecake, but sometimes you can tell when it isn&#39;t fresh made, and it&#39;s always a damper on our meal.

This place is fantastic, amazing value, amazing food, amazing service, and the atmosphere is perfect for going out on a date.  Lunch is truly an amazing deal, for $16, you get bruschetta with fresh mozzarella cheese, soup of the day (mushroom soup is my fav), entree (any entree on the menu), and tiramisu or gelato.  

unlike other italian restaurants that smother your food with cheese and cream, francesca&#39;s is light - you can taste the fresh ingredients.

I have been going to Francesca downtown naperville for years but the south naperville one is nicer, newer, great outdoor seating, and there&#39;s plenty of parking.  it&#39;s worth the drive here to not deal with the downtown naperville crowd and traffic.

for the millionth time i&#39;ve been here, no one in my party ever had to wait for drinks or refills, and the service is always top notch.  this is by far my favorite place to eat in naperville."

We had reservations for a muggy Friday night, thankful to enjoy a relaxing dinner inside. Unfortunately, they had all the doors open to the patio, so our &#34;inside&#34; dinner turned muggy quickly. While the patio looked fun, we definitely won&#39;t return. The food selection was slim and overpriced, and the service was incredibly slow (with the exception of the busboys). We ordered a second round of drinks before our dinner came out...we received our dinner, ate it, had leftovers packaged, and several refills of water before our server came over - without drinks. What I ended up truly being thankful was a giftcard that covered all but $8 of our meal."

The staff helped me through the preparation and execution of plan.  Every one contributed especially the Manager and the lady who served our table.. 
They arranged the table with Roses and Petals..  my girlfriend was amazed with the way table was decorated.  They had specially arranged for flowers as requested by me over the phone.  I had planned few gifts for her they brought her every gift step by step and very finely.. after she accepted my proposal, every member of the team came to our table to wish us and give rose to my fiance.   

In the excitement we were not able to make any decision.  so the lady kindly helped us through the menu served best dishes.

Prices were just perfect too!!
Served complimentary Champagne like cherry on the cream

highly recommended!!!

The team made our day as memorable as it could get!!!

Just added note:  Other places I contacted were not so friendly and did not agree to help me as I was planning."

Francesca&#39;s Passaggio serves excellent Italian food.  My friends had suggested it for a small reunion dinner. I had pre-conceived notions based on my past experience with the Francesca&#39;s in other areas, (downtown Naperville, Chicago, etc..)  Nope. Passaggio put me in my place.  Appetizers, entrees and desserts were very, very good.  Service was impeccable and attentive.  I love that.  We never had to ask for anything. They know how to do it here.  I would suggest you take a chance on dishes that you may never have had before.  Don&#39;t worry...they don&#39;t stray too far from traditional.  You should try it out.

it&#39;s always been ridiculously delicious.  The food is always rich and flavorful...so if you try to take your time (which is hard because it&#39;s so amazing it&#39;s difficult not to eat it all at once!)  you can usually get two meals out of a pasta dish.  

I&#39;ve heard rumors that the salmon here is really good.  I will be trying that next.

I have eaten here several times and never been unhappy with my meal. This Francesca&#39;s seems to always have more fish on their menu which is nice becuase I am a fan of good seafood and italian food. The menu is always evolving and  has a few new items or specials as well as a few of their tried and true menu items that are always available. Service is always good.

I know what I wanted, she wrote down what she thought I wanted.  I did not want to ruin my families meal, so I kept the dish.  When she returned to the table I said this is not what I wanted, she continued to call me hon, and honey, even though I asked her to stop. All I really need to hear is I&#39;m sorry there was a mistake, but she was such a blasted bulldog, speaking loud and forcefull right in my face. I received a dish I clearly did not like, I did not want it, I did not like it and I had to deal with a Bulldog barking in my face.

I have been going to this particular restaurant for about 6 years.  They have been our &#34;go to&#34; special occasion/night out restaurant.  All I can say is the francescas of the old days is long gone. The last 5 times I&#39;ve been here have been subpar to downright awful. It seems as though when they purchased their other brands they moved their cooks and management to those restaurants and left Francescas to rot.  This last visit was at about 5 on a Thursday.  Three other tables were seated.  First issue was our drink glasses were filthy with lipstick around the rims. We asked for new ones and the waiter brought back fresh drinks in another set of dirty lipstick stained glasses.  The third time they were brought back the glasses were clean but one of the drinks was wrong?! I ordered the calamari for an appetizer which was clearly a mix of two batches. Some were cooked perfect while others were way over cooked.  My salmon was also over cooked.  It was also listed to be served with avocado, but instead came with an ice cream scoop of guacamole?! My wife&#39;s pasta came missing a fresh mozzarella topping and was bland.  Bringing it to the waiters attention was futile. He was MIA most of the night and was very goofy and talked like a surfer/stoner.  &#34;Like cool man I&#39;ll get you some fresh glasses?!&#34;  There was no manager to be seen.  We just threw up our hands and paid the bill.  I sent corporate two emails to ask them what the heck is up with this place, but they never responded.  It seems it&#39;s a culture that has trickled down from the top.  We used to love this restaurant group, but no more.  Never again will they get my money."

We ate at the Passaggio on a Friday evening. I see what people have said in their other reviews - the place is loud, the tables are very close together and the ambience is plain. 

My biggest complaint is a big one: the food. We both had the lobster bisque - if was good, but with each bite it became less impressive. The menu was a bit unimpressive - I had a difficult time picking out something appealing. I chose a ravioli of sorts that was filled with lobster and crab with a cream sauce - it was so fishy tasting! I love lobster and crab and have never experienced a fishy taste from them! My husband pitied me and we switched entrees.  His was a shrimp and scallop pasta with a &#34;spicy marinara.&#34; The shrimp were tough (over-cooked) and the sauce had zero flavor - one step away from being canned tomatoes. He didn&#39;t care for either dish either, but wasn&#39;t as repulsed as I was. 

I really thought it was pretty bad and should have complained, but didn&#39;t feel comfortable doing so. Long story short, for one of our rare nights out with no kids, we paid $80 for a meal that we hated."

Almost $30 for an overcooked piece of Grouper is ridiculous. Their chef has obviously never been to Italy as they over load/over power their pasta dishes (and others) with way too much garlic instead of relying on the natural flavors of the ingredients. Very disappointing...used to go their quite a bit but never again.

The bottle of pinot noir we ordered came with a twist cap.  That&#39;s right.   A TWIST CAP!  The food was ok, but  this joint is tacky with a capital &#34;T&#34;. 

If you want a good Italian meal, go to  Maggiano&#39;s, Biaggis, Rosebuds, or the Francesca&#39;s in downtown Naperville.  Hell, Olive Garden is better than this place."

I was at work at the time, but once I heard &#34;Francesca&#39;s&#34;, I put my equipment away and headed home to change.  I haven&#39;t been out to dinner in a while and the food there is simply not to be missed.

By the time I&#39;d arrived, they&#39;d already eaten but the birthday girl insisted I try the pork chops.  It was smothered in mushrooms and some sort of (cran?)berry, and was simply delicious.  The special attention our waiter gave to me after being a late arrival is almost expected at this point since they&#39;re always extremely accommodating and polite.  THAT impresses me even more than their cuisine.

The reason for the lacking star?  Noise.  Having a conversation is a bit challenging, but it&#39;s forgivable.  You&#39;ll be too busy enjoying your dinner to talk, anyway."

We had reservations at Passaggio after 8pm and we called on the way over from the car to make sure they still had the special and did not run out. They said yes, special was still ON...10 minutes later, we arrived and guess what...?...they were out of lasagna. Total BUMMER, as this was the main reason we were going...to try the lasagna AND we even called to reconfirm. I had the rigatoni and friend had a chicken breast dish...rigatoni was very tasty, chicken dish was bland...but ordered for it&#39;s simplicity ( friend is a healthy eater so it was fine). The menu changes daily so if you like something, it may not be available the next time, so keep that in mind. I like the bread with the oil and fresh parm at the table. The room is a tad noisy and try for a booth instead of a table in the middle of the room.The lady who refilled the water and dropped off the bread was on her game and our glasses of vino and water were never empty. We appreciate that. Our server was friendly, prompt and had good suggestions on entr√©e selections considering they did not have enough lasagna prepared. The bonus of the evening is when our server told us Wednesday is half off bottles of wine! Chalk Hill Chardonnay half off...takes a $52 bottle of Vino and makes it totally affordable for a weeknight...We will be back on a Wednesday and hopefully will get to try out the lasagna in the near future."

Let&#39;s start with the decor- I was taken aback by the starkness and the confusion of the styles. In some ways it looks like they shopped at Dania or a similar store. Not that this is bad but I would prefer that the inside of an Italian restaurant be more warm and comforting rather than as cold as the decor is of this place.

The night we visited the menu was heavy with meats and veals- there was only one pasta dish that was truly &#34;vegetarian&#34; in nature. On the plus side, our server said that any pasta dish could be prepared gluten free (which we found out later meant omitting the pasta).

Our server was attentive and helpful but it seems as if there is a severe lack of waitstaff. Even though our waitress was nice and helpful she seemed worn out and overworked- it was a &#34;worn out&#34; vibe that seemed to be everywhere you looked.

As another reviewer noted- the noise level is high and conversation is difficult. My guess is that the acoustics are poor and could use some help.

The meals we were served were &#34;OK&#34; but not particularly memorable or well presented. To be honest- I was very disappointed in what we were served given the personal recommendations that I had been given.

I like to linger with another cocktail or a shared dessert but I was more than ready to leave after our entree plates were cleared. We actually went somewhere else nearby for our after dinner cocktail.

I just don&#39;t know what to make of this place- I guess it&#39;s much like the greater Naperville area; cultivating the perception that it is more than it really is and going for snob appeal rather than substance."

I ordered some lobster bisque and I think I only had this once before so I don&#39;t know how it is suppose to taste. However there was some shells while eating it and that was not very good. My wife ordered a caprice salad and that was good. 

We ordered a couple of drinks. I tried some jack Daniels drink and my wife got a mojito. My wife&#39;s mojito was disappointing. She got it here before and loved it. This time it didn&#39;t taste like it had any liquor in it and it was not very minty. My drink was too strong and all I tasted was the jack. However our waitress took my wife drink off the bill

For the main entree I ordered a lobster filled pasta and my wife got a pizza. My wife&#39;s pizza was excellent. It tasted like I was eating saganaki.  We weren&#39;t sure how good it would be with the lemon but it worked extremely well. My lobster pasta (can&#39;t remember what it was called) was good not great. I would not recommend it because of the price as it was nineteen dollars. 

The service was also excellent. They made sure our water was always full. That is always a plus in my book. She was very apologetic when my wife complained about her drink and they did take it off the bill, even though we didn&#39;t want them too. Our food and soup and salad came out at a good time. Brought us two loaves of bread which i forgot to mention were also really good. 

So in conclusion I might go back again but i wouldn&#39;t go anytime soon. Although the pizza, salad, and the service were really good the prices are a little expensive and the drinks really need some work. However it is still better than Olive Garden."

A nice present of a gift card forced my hand and I&#39;m so glad that I chose the Passagio this time! What an absolutely different experience.

We made reservations for 7:30 on a Saturday night. It was packed on arrival and I was told they were running behind. We sat at the bar and waited, I was already having flashbacks to my crummy previous visit and regretting the second chance.  Shortly there after, the front of the house manager stopped by and offered us a $10 giftcard towards drinks and said that someone would be out with a complementary appetizer to tide us over while we waited.  Hmm, I thought, this is service.  We received an entire plate of their bruschetta to enjoy over a couple glasses of wine.  Things were looking up!

We were seated by a very apologetic staff member and taken care of by a very sweet young man who had nothing but smiles and great recommendations.  We did another appetizer, as if the bruschetta wasn&#39;t enough, but the selections were too intriguing to pass up another.  We both ordered something from their pasta menu - I tried the gnocchi while my dining partner had some orchicetta with sausage, veggies, and tasty cheeses.  Their menus change periodically throughout the season.  We were stuffed!  The bill was hardly intimidating and in fact, I still had money left on that $50 gift card afterwards.  

This trip was a breath of fresh air from my previous Francesca&#39;s visit.  Thank you, Passagio, for redeeming this restaurant group and convincing me to come back again and again."

My parents chose this restaurant for a father&#39;s day dinner and I defo enjoyed it but I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s anything that I would crave or go out of my way for. 

At the time I was a meat eater and I selected beef carpaccio for our appetizer and it was very delicious. I enjoyed it very much and there was a really great sized portion for $13 but I have to mention that it had a really excessive amount of capers... like maybe there was a kitchen accident with the caper jar? I also had a salad before our meal and I thought the salad was very lacking in size and ingredients but it was a pre meal thing so I got over it. 

I got a fish dish for dinner and it was good but I thought there was a bit too much oil on the plate as a whole. Then again, I&#39;m also seeing a pattern with this at other Italian restaurants so maybe that&#39;s how everyone else likes it and I&#39;m just not accustomed. I finished all of it and left no room for dessert, unfortunately. 

Though I did enjoy Francesca&#39;s, I would really have liked to see a more extensive menu and maybe some more risk taking options to choose from as everything seemed very run of the mill. Also, the decor really leaves something to be desired. It&#39;s like minimal cheap diner decor or along the thought process of &#34;it&#39;s my first apartment and I know my lease is up in 8 months and I&#39;m moving out but I&#39;ll buy some frames with black and white photos already in them and hang em&#34;. I think they did just enough to get by but should really reconsider investing some time and money in an interior decorator and lighting company. A little romance and mystery would easily bump this place up a star and a half."

I dont dine in as often as I use to. Mainly because the group of servers are full of themselves at this location. Now, I primarily order to-go. The food is equally as good at home as it is in the restaurant. 

Most of their pasta dishes consist of simple recipes and simple ingridients. Yet, they&#39;re delicious. They blow olive garden and the like out of the water, and the prices are only 15-20% greater. Not too shabby. App&#39;s are great, salads are ok, and soups are good. Dessert is decent too. They make a variety of protien dishes, which are all typically good.

I&#39;ll admit the risotto was yummy. That was the only good thing though. The hostess didn&#39;t even smile when she greeted us. She seemed annoyed and I could tell she hates her job. She knew there were five of us and seated us at a really small table. The whole time we were bumping elbos. The bussers where still clearing off our table while we were getting settled at the table. Our server how ever, I don&#39;t know his name because he never told us, don&#39;t know the portion sizes of the dinners and seemed like he wanted to leave an was very annoyed. I paid 10 dollars to eat one crab cake. I can go some where else and pay 10 dollars for a plate of three crab cakes. I&#39;m not impressed. Back to the busser she was very rude. I was trying to have a conversation with my dining partner and she would shove her self in the way to get the crumbs off the table. She could have just waited till we left. Also the servers need to lower their voices when gossiping about costumers. I work at a restaurant myself and our staff is ten times better and the staff is well trained on our menu. I think management needs to step it up. Over all, the staff is rude, the food eh it&#39;s alright. I don&#39;t think ill be spending money here anytime soon.

We were underdressed, but they were very nice about it and they had a kid&#39;s menu for the nephew (who didn&#39;t properly appreciate his excellent cheese pizza...oh well).  It&#39;s in a strip mall at what seemed like the ends of the earth.

The food was excellent and the service pretty good.  It was awfully crowded (we were here for dinner).  I had the risotto, which I found merely good, but my sister was captivated.

Menu is handwritten and apparently changes every 2 weeks.  A little pricey but worth it for really good Italian."

This is not the original location and lacks some of the flare which is the only reason it missed the elusive 5th star.

Their handwritten menu changes every two weeks.  This way it&#39;s like a new restaurant every time you come.  The pasta is fresh and oh so delicious.  Try a little pizza for an appetizer you won&#39;t soon forget.  They always have fish and meat offerings on the menu and their fish dishes are incredible.

It is a rather small restaurant and it can get loud.  So if you&#39;re looking for intimate go elsewhere, but if you seek awesome Italian food look no further."

As of right now it shows the position of the restaurant as being at the corner of 75th street and Route 59... that&#39;s not actually the case. It&#39;s about 2 or 3 miles south of 75th street.

Now on to the meal. My wife and I shared a caesar salad that was just the right amount for the two of us. If each person got their own salad it would be a little too much to eat before moving on to the entree. So keep that in mind.

For my entree I had chicken that was covered with a red sauce (it had a fancy name that I don&#39;t remember). This wasn&#39;t your typical marinara sauce which was nice, and the presentation was very well done. I wasn&#39;t overly impressed with quality of the meal, but the uniqueness of the entrees available was rather refreshing. The selection available can be rather limiting though so make sure whomever you&#39;re going with also wants Italian because aside from the pizza options on the menu the other items are all very much pasta-centric, or (as in my case with the chicken) at least include a pasta on the side.

Now if only they could get away from that handwritten menu. Some people see it as a nice personalized touch and adds to the ever-changing entrees, but I just find it to be a mess to read."

This is now one of my top favorite Italian restaurants. So much easier than the overblown, overcrowded downtown Naperville location. Delectable, fresh dishes that orchestrate the nuances famous in Italian dishes, and such a variety of items on the menu! The pizza of the day on our visit was the pizza della foresta which featured wild mushrooms, a little too cheesy for real Italian pizza, but delectable on a thin, flatbread-crunchy-like crust. The rigatoni melanzana, chicken florentine, penne alla paesana...and the desserts... torta volcano and crema alla vaniglia...wow. Delectable from start to finish.

All the busboys and waiters hustled and kept checking in with us even though the dining floor was buzzing. Excellent service and delicious food. A must! especially features much more personality and original Italian taste than nearby Biaggi&#39;s."

Nice idea, but a little more organization would be nice - ie. don&#39;t squeeze in words that don&#39;t fit just anywhere.  Maybe different colors for the name of the dishes vs the description might help.  Its a quaint idea..

The bread was more on the crusty side but was perfect with the entrees.  The bruschetta with prosciutto was delicious.  The cheese wasn&#39;t a big wad as it usually is, more of a fluffy creamy texture, and the tomatoes in it was marinated well.  The calamari was well cooked, marinara sauce was good with large chunks in it which is the way I usually like it.  

I got the spaghetti with mussels - the sauce had a great flavor, almost on the salty side but not quite there.  The mussels were a good size, not teeny like it is in some places.  The bread was excellent with the sauce.  Loved the amount of mussels the dish came with as well.  

The tiramisu was one of the best I&#39;ve ever had.  Loved the drizzles of chocolate around the plate.

All in all, can&#39;t wait to return and see them again.  The service was excellent, the atmosphere is nice, and most of the food was excellent.  Not crazy creative, just a solid italian place with a few quirky touches."

This evening, my husband had a chicken dish while I had one of the specials on the menu, a jalepeno and roasted red pepper pasta dish with a vodka cream sauce. We also shared a ceasar salad. Their salads are pretty large, so you can very easily split one with someone else.

Service was good. Our waiter had several other tables but kept on top of it well.

Overall, another great dining experience at Francesca&#39;s! I love that their menu changes (it&#39;s handwritten) which means there is always something new to try."

Passaggio is modestly (cough) located in a crappy strip mall, right off crappy route 59, spittin&#39; distance from crappy Plainfield.
Once you enter the restaurant though...

The decor is nice. The ambiance is simple, not snooty. The service was great... our waitress talked up how well the Francesca&#39;s owners run the place and treat her and other employees. And the food is outstanding!

I had the lobster bisque with the crab chunks. Drool. Entree was the spinach ravioli in the heavenly sauce. Dessert was awesome tiramisu. So great.

Fairly attractive space inside with a big private party room adjacent. Its a big hit with lots of locals, but I think its more of a meeting, socializing and wine thing than great food.

I&#39;ve been to quite a few locations. The food is to die for. I just started working back in Naperville after being in Lombard for the last couple years. I had a craving for the Pollo alla salvia. Chicken prosciutto spinach mozzarella in a light tomato sauce with a side of pasta. I get back to work only to find no spinach or pasta. I called and they told me that pasta doesn&#39;t come with it for lunch. WTF?!?!? no pasta?!?! It would have been nice knowing that before I ordered it. I paid $13.99 for 2 pieces of chicken when for dinner it would cost $14.99. The food was still good as always but I was hoping to get 2 meals out of this instead of just 1.

The dining room was packed and all tables were filled so it was very loud. The wait staff was fabulous and very attentive. They had to squeeze between patrons  and personal space was quite minimal.  The food was delicious and the bread was very fresh!  We come here often with friends for a meal that never disappoints!"

There was less than a foot between my table and the surrounding guests. The restaurant quickly filled up and the noise level sky rocketed. The noise combined with the T-shirts the wait staff wore clashed with the classy decor and I&#39;m still not sure what &#34;ambiance&#34; the restaurant was going for: bar or fancy Italian restaurant?

Now the food. We started out with the prosciutto which was served probably two minutes after we ordered it. The appetizer was as good as expected; the meat and the cheeses were fresh and delicious. We had barely finished the appetizer when our split plate arrived. We ordered the Rigatoni del Pastore. The pasta was barely cooked and the slices of Italian sausage were way too big and couldn&#39;t be broken up with a fork. When I managed to gnaw my way through a chewy, crunchy noodle, I got a face full of goat cheese. This dish drowned in enormous hunks of goat cheese that had no business being there. The goat cheese pasted my tongue and dominated any other possible positive flavors. What sauce I did end up tasting was bland and had a weird, goopy texture. The dessert managed to redeem the meal, however. We had the Profiteroles al Pistachio Gelato and since I hadn&#39;t really gotten my hopes up, I was pleasantly surprised. The gelato was amazing and worth the risk.

Overall, I was displeased with my experience. Our waitress was excellent, that definitely needs to be mentioned. There was one woman who would not let me take more than a couple sips of my water before she refilled my glass. It got to be obnoxious. She filled my glass around 12 times, disrupting my conversation every single time. It also felt like they were trying to shove us out of the restaurant. There was no wait between any courses and the crowd forming in the bar area suggested they were only concerned with a quick turn around. I&#39;m sure Francesca&#39;s other locations are fine, but this experience left a bad taste in my mouth in addition to the goat cheese I&#39;m still trying to scrape off my tongue. Don&#39;t get your hopes up for this place, it&#39;s not worth the money or time."
francescas-passaggio-naperville,J.R. L.,4ym0IdHUwCUA6-lHJ6PHAQ,"Aurora, IL",0,1,0,1,26,5W1hWWJNTEPpbQv3KYjUVQ,2.0,2011-07-12,"since moving to Aurora over a year ago, we&#39;ve probably had Francesca&#39;s at least 10 times, counting dine-in and carry-out. The food&#39;s pretty good, but nothing spectacular. The Caesar salad here is definitely not your typical Caesar and the first time I ate it, I was taken aback. Now, I&#39;ve grown to like it, but I think they should rename it, as it&#39;s not what people expect when they order a Caesar salad.
Like another reviewer said, the food is not very exciting and the variety of dishes is limited. 
The main reason for this review is because the last few times we got carry-out, our orders have been messed up: the Caesar salad comes with the dressing on the side in a little plastic container. Whoever packed the food forgot to include the dressing, so I basically paid about $6 or $7 for a bunch of lettuce with a few croutons. When I called to complain, all they offered was a free Caesar on a future order. So they basically just paid for my salad, but did nothing to recompenate for the aggravation. If I was the manager, I would have given 2 salads, or a free appetizer or something. 
On our last carry-out order, we ordered a pasta con Pollo, but received a pasta with mozzarella. I really should have checked my food before I brought it home, but.... 
Everytime we&#39;ve ever ordered carryout, they include a some cut bread with olive oil. That&#39;s something that we look forward to, but didn&#39;t receive any on a recent order.
Here&#39;s another good one: my husband and I ate in Francesca&#39;s and both ordered filets. He ordered his Medium, with Bleu cheese crumbles. I ordered mine Medium-Well, with some other sauce, possibly Bearnaise..? anyway, when the steaks arrived, there was some mixup. Matt&#39;s steak was cooked Medium-Well, and mine was cooked Medium. Normally, this would be something that I could overlook, and we would have simply switched steaks. However, they had already put the different sauces on top. We hailed the waiter, and he took them away. When they were brought back to the table, it was clear that the kitchen staff simply took the sauces off the steaks and did a little switcheroo. I received Matt&#39;s steak with the correct sauce, and he received my original steak with his correct sauce. (I knew this was so b/c we each cut into our steaks distinctly differently). I thought that was incredibly tacky, but didn&#39;t say anything. The best thing was, the manager came over to apologize. but she had the gall to say that they had re-cooked everything, when they clearly just switched the steaks. Either the kitchen lied to her, or she lied to our faces. Either way, it was incredibly disappointing. They could have at least comped our drinks, or dessert, but they offered NOTHING for their mistake. 
Anyway, I&#39;ve been getting very annoyed and frustrated at their lapse in service. I feel the need to inspect everthing in my bag to make sure I&#39;m getting what I ordered. 
We&#39;d probably just start eating elsewhere, but unfortunately there are no other decent Italian restaurants nearby."

The food was great and everything that I&#39;ve had here has been of high quality.  On this visit, service was also good--unobtrusive yet attentive.  The only downside to our last visit was that we had a somewhat cavalier water/bus boy that spilled water on some guide books our friends were lending us, and didn&#39;t offer an apology--came back and made a lame attempt of sopping some of his spillage up.

That news made me sad. First, I am a vegan myself, and I had eaten at Francesca&#39;s Passaggio on many occasions. I had always asked in the past whether there was any meat, dairy, or eggs in the vegan-looking pasta dishes that I ordered, and I was always told no. Now, I think that almost all of the dishes that I ate must have been vegan, because they used only wine or olive oil as a dressing, but I did have the marinara once or twice. So, there are some pasta dishes that vegans and vegetarians can order, and some of them are quite good. Look for the &#34;cold sauce&#34;, which is available in the summer months. It is delicious. 

I feel that I should award the restaurant one star given that some of the waitstaff didn&#39;t know that none of the pasate sauces are vegetarian (seriously, get it together). However, I will ignore that issue and award the restaurant three stars for vegetarians and vegans. Why three? Some of the dishes are one or two stars, and some are four or even five. So, three stars."

But then when the dish was served there was a large glop of avocado and tomato salad covering the top third of the asparagus.  Which brings us to presentation.  Since when is sprinkling parsley over the rim of every plate presentation?  This just screams, Chain Restaurant!  Our busser, Monica, remembered us from when we were regulars.

It&#39;s also nice because there&#39;s really not a dress code, probably not ratty shorts &amp; ripped t-shirts, but definitely jean-friendly. Try the pepe-imbottiti if you like spicy..they&#39;re stuffed cherry peppers(hot variety) with provolone &amp; prosciutto(sp?). Good good stuff. Last week I had a mascarpone cheesecake with limoncello creme anglaise &amp; toasted pine nuts..DIVINE!"

After having two meals at the new Craftsman down the street we decided to try out Empire. This is an upscale burger joint with a far ranging selection of beers and Bourbons.  They have a great menu of creative burgers with price points between $10 and $12.  Sophia Loren burger was outstanding. People who had Vegetariat and Plain Jane raved.  And you have to have the donuts at the end of the meal. Don&#39;t ask why. Just do it!

We had lunch on the upper floor with the sun streaming in and the doors open for the fresh November air. The server Christie was outstanding. We will definitely come back."

We ordered the Burger cigars and love those as well as the Empire tots. The habanero ranch drizzle on the tots is super hot so get it on the side if you are sensitive to spice. The Burger cigars remind me of a really, really good hot pocket. I love the sweetness of the honey on them.
The yardbird sandwich was good.  The fries are average. The KeyWest was good. The Gronk is huge so bring your stretch pants or plan to share. The burgers are decent but just not a lot of flavor in the &#39;actual burger&#39;. There is a lot of &#39;extras&#39; like drizzles and such that try to add flavor but really just make it messy. The chips are pretty good though. I like the sweet honey BBQ flavor of them.
We have had the fried doughnuts and those are yummy.
The hot pear cider is recommended while they have it. Reminds me of a spiked, spiced hot apple cider.

It&#39;s trendy, has a city-esque feel to it, and there&#39;s no denying the fabulous rooftop bar and seating. From the looks of things, this place really has it all together. Me personally? I still feel like they have some things to work out.

I&#39;ve been here twice now, once for lunch and once for a drink after work. We sat inside on the main level as the rooftop wasn&#39;t open during the day (too bad because it was beautiful out). The restaurant was pretty empty during the lunch hour. You would think this would help service be more attentive and on point, but it took a very long time for our group to be greeted by a server which kind of rubbed us the wrong way (bad first impression).

We started with the poutine fries ($9) which were pretty good. Fried mozzarella chunks, cheddar, gravy, bacon, and sour cream all on top of french fries is a recipe for delicious. This app was a bit on the soggy side, but overall a tasty dish.

I also had the BBQ brisket sandwich which had beer BBQ sauce, cheddar, and apple cabbage slaw on a pretzel bun roll ($14). I really liked this! I thought it was very flavorful. A bit overpriced, but delicious none the less. 

The second time I stopped by was to meet people for a drink after work and we sat up on the rooftop. It can get pretty crowded at Empire on a Friday night, so at 6:30 pm be prepared to wait for a seat upstairs. From what I can tell they offer valet parking and rumor has it there&#39;s a cover charge for late night on the weekends (no thanks).

The opening of Empire was long awaited and I hope with time they will fully live up to my expectations. While you&#39;ll definitely find me on their roof top on a nice day, I can&#39;t say I&#39;m going to be a regular here any time soon. For city prices downtown Naperville, I expect a higher level of service and attention."

I went to seat upstairs by the transparent glass ceiling it was very nice to enjoy the sun on my back.  My partner in crime was not happy to sit here because the sun shine was on his face, oh well.   I order the goat medium well.  I loved it.  At first I got scared for a minute because I thought the hamburger was saturated of oil but it was the honey that accompany the bacon and goat cheese.  It was very delicious.   The only complain I have is that the servers do NOT have bus boys so I was so thirsty I had to waive the server to bring me water.  

This restaurant has a lot of potential but has to work on the customers that are eating on napkins, utensil, extra plates and serving wAter.  One more thing the host lacks experience on the sitting arrangements because she asked us if we had our name on the list?   The restaurant was very much empty when we got there.   I think she was confused so am like we called and we were told no reservations needed.

While their cool sign outside immediately caught my attention, the rooftop bar caught my friends attention - and I&#39;m glad it did!

Neither of us had heard of Empire but with the sight of the rooftop bar we decided to head on up and check it out. Nobody talked to us when we walked in, while heading up, or once we got upstairs, but we found a couple of seats at the bar and snatched them up. The service at the bar was slow - I mean it was probably 15 minutes before anyone asked if we&#39;d like a drink - but we were taking a while deciding on our order anyway so it was fine. Also the girl at the bar next to us definitely should have been cut off. She fell and couldn&#39;t get up. And it was a Tuesday around 9 pm...to say the least. So that got interesting. And nobody behind the bar seemed to notice or help. 

Anyway - the rooftop bar was a cool place to hang out and enjoy a drink. I didn&#39;t notice much of what they had aside from a nice sized list of draft beers. Hopefully I can return soon and try some food!"

Both sandwiches were served on a pretzel roll with either chips or fries.  After we were served our food, our waiter became more interactive with us so my opinion of him went up a notch.

The inside is very spacious and there is a stage on the main floor for entertainment, a huge bar, a small first floor patio, a second floor, a second floor bar, and a second floor rooftop patio with a touted retractable roof. *takes deep breath* This place has a lot of space, and it looks like it will be well used. 

I was impressed with the service, with it being the first evening for outside patrons. We were checked regularly while we sat at the bar. The bartenders make pretty great mixed drinks and don&#39;t water them down, which is always a plus. They have an extensive beer tap list and I was very excited that they had a few sour beers available. 

As far as the food, I can&#39;t give a full review because we only tried the freshly made donuts. They were absolutely wonderful-warm and soft and dusted with delicious sugar. They gave us more than enough and I think that the serving matches the 8 dollar price just fine. I only wished for a larger serving of donut dipping sauce. 

For now I&#39;m giving Empire four stars, just because I haven&#39;t fully tried their food offerings. I think with the right dishes and a steady stream of good entertainment on the stage, this place will be worthy of visiting on the regular."

The food is good not great its better then five guys n any other burger place in town i liked the empire tots the burger cigar the goat n the empire burger now lets talk about the bad 1 the service theirs alot of employees but it seems like theirs lack of training n some might not even be fixable. expect slow service n confusion on where the foods going because they dont know ask for everything as soon as u sit down like napkins dippin sauce or anythin u need because u either wont get it or receive it at the end of the meal. 2 they never put enough sauce on anytjin idk what their problem is if they jus are lazy or cheap but ask for extra sauce because everything needs more sauce. 3 the bugers need to be bigger n more flavorful for the price their expensive so the burger itself needs fixing 4 toast the bun plz nobody likes soggy buns 5 add more desserts plz 6 becareful the floor might be wet in some places u could easily fall 7 plz season ur fries n tatter tots plz i like my fries to actually have a taste if they fixed these issues then it would be a better restaurant i would come Back if im in the mood for burgers n dont feel like Drivin to kumas corners

Empire tots $8: their homemade i thought they were gonna be the frozen kind. I would have liked them to be a little more Crunchier  but they werent greasy so it wasnt so bad. The actual tot was filled with cheese so delish i dont remember seeing bacon in it. The one issue with the tot it needed seasoning really badly salt n pepper would have made this dish amaizin. It is spicy which i liked but the one thing i was missing was the sauce theirs not alot like literly theirs like a smudge if u paid me a million dollars i wouldnt be able to tell u what the sauce was so ask for more. I liked the addition of the egg for richness jus wish the egg had seasoning on it. The scallions added bite to cut through the richness all in all good jus if they fixed it this dish would be a home Run

Cartel burger 15$: this was the least favorite burger of the night. Its a chorizo patty i was expecting so much flavor since it has chroizo in it there was a lil kick to it but the patty was small n really bland i was expecting a very spicy flavorful patty. The guac didnt really add anythin it needed more lemon for some pop. Then theirs these corn fritters that were good a lil greasy i liked them cause they added a sweet element to the dish. Again their wasnt enough sauce so burger was a lil dry because of that i wouldnt order this again the bun needs to be toasted because it gets to soggy. The fries this time
Wererent seasoned

The goat 14$ this burger was amaizin when u read the ingredients youll be like wtf doesnt sound good but it was amaizin! Make sure it has alot of honey in it or it wont taste good. Goat cheese n honey best combination ever. The creamy tart flavor of the goat cheese blended perfect with the sweet honey then theirs bacon in there for saltyness like ur tongue will have the best party if u order this

Cigar burger 9$ cool name n it tastes great jus ask for more sauce!!! Its in an eggroll it was really crunchy but greasy the filling was amaizin i loved the pimento cheese but i wish their was more meat because its mostly cheese other then that i would order it again

The empire burger 14$: this burger was really good the additon of the bacon added a nice salty richness to the dish that was really amaizin like who doesnt want bacon in the actual burger, so that being said it wasnt lacking flavor i liked the egg i love eggs on burgers it makes it really rich. Idk if i liked the cream cheese it was good jus i would have preferred more creativity maybe like a cheese
sauce instead or a more rich tasting cheese. I loved the addition of the sweetness of the maple syrup but yet again plz put more idk what is this place skimping on all the sauces

Sofia loren 14$ this was my least favorite burger ive had here i liked the fresh mozzarella u cant put enough of it, its my favorite cheese that was the only good part of the burger it was really bland and flavorless. The pesto was really bland an a pesto should be really herbaceous n really flavorful. The balsamic reduction wasnt reduced at all it made the burger soggy wouldnt order again

Fried donuts 8$ texturally really good they were light n fluffy i hate hard donuts n they werent raw in the middle or greasy. Its coated evenly with cinnamon n sugar sometimes the coating isnt on all the donuts this wasnt the case their big n theirs alot of them so u do get ur moneys worth but the sauce was gross they really do need to update it maybe a nutella dipping sauce or u could even put cayenne pepper on the donuts to cut through the richness or the sweetness n add another dessert plz 1 isnt enough"

It has beautiful wooden walls with metal tables/chairs but the best part is the Edison bulbs above the bar and the spiral staircase that leads to the top floor. 

The food looked amazing but the meat on our sandwiches were not appetizing at all. We got the turkey burger and the Yardhouse...both of which could have had better meat. The turkey burger looked and tasted like a frozen patty and fried chicken had a very foul taste to it. The presentation was great but it definitely needs work on make the taste just as great."

The restaurant/bar is at the site of the old Rosebud restaurant and overlooks the river. It has an outstanding vibe, cool, recycled decorations, including a bar that is made with some stuff from Charlie Comiskey&#39;s old barn. Comiskey was the original owner of the Chicago White Sox. 

The service is working through the kinks that come with any new place, but the managers of the place have lots of experience and will get it right. 

The menu is simple: Burgers (all of which can be converted into chicken or veggie burgers), salads, sandwiches (the hot chicken is fabulous) and fried doughnuts for dessert. 

Drink menu has some interesting concoctions on it and also a wide array of craft and mainstream beers, all at a good price. 

Empire is committed to keeping the beer between 37 and 41 degrees from storage, to lines to tap to glass. So you&#39;re assured of a quality pour should you go the tap route. They also make their own nitrogen for the nitro beers. 

As for the ambiance, there is nothing like it in Naperville. The retractable rooftop, the three balconies, the private party room, the stage - where live music I&#39;m sure will appear eventually - and the big ass bar on the main floor with TV&#39;s all around are all excellent.

I&#39;ve been waiting ages for this place to finally open. The bf and I decided to stop in for lunch on a Tuesday. Although they have only been open a couple days (and we&#39;d take that into consideration when rating food and service), we figured a Tuesday would be the perfect time to stop in without having to battle the weekend crowds.  We were promptly seated on the main floor at a booth overlooking the river. The main floor is huge and has a stage set up for live music.  The d√©cor is gorgeous, a nice mix of rustic and industrial. The rooftop deck with retractable roof is a nice touch, along with the other two levels of decks. So many different seating options, depending on the atmosphere you&#39;re looking for.

I ordered the Key West turkey burger w/maple bourbon glaze, pineapple, caramelized onions and chili garlic aioli. Wow! Great textures and packed with flavor. The fries were nice and crispy and perfectly seasoned. The bf ordered the Empire burger made with 50/50 beef and ground bacon, spring mix, cream cheese, green onion, maple bourbon glaze and topped with an egg. This was the star of the meal! Oh, and the food came lightning fast! You can also order beer samples for $1 each, which is a great way to try ahead! The only thing is there&#39;s a limit of 2 per person - lame.

Our waitress was attentive and friendly and made helpful recommendations. I&#39;m looking forward to stopping in again, either for a few drinks on the rooftop, or for another fabulous meal!"

Even if you&#39;re coming for dinner, you&#39;ll have to pay a $7 cover regardless...cash only.  We had to hit the ATM at Peanuts and when we got back there was a small line of indecisive 21 years olds in line so we went around them and went in.  The hostess downstairs told us to see the hostess upstairs about sitting up there.  We got up there and there were two guys who worked on staff hanging out and they seemed confused as they asked if we saw the hostess downstairs - we said we did, and she sent us upstairs.  This is NOT the runaround you want when you&#39;re out on a Friday night AND hungry... anyway, the hostess seemed almost as confused as them when she came back but took our name &amp; number and said it would be an hour to an hour and a half wait and we&#39;d get a text when our table was ready.  We scored a spot at the bar and got a glass and a half into our drinks when our table was ready...doubtful it was even an hour.  Our server was pretty great...super friendly &amp; quirky!  We both ordered the GOAT burger... not ginormous, but a good size and good taste.  Both the fries &amp; chips were good.  I got the chips, my friend got the fries.  We were offered dessert...though tempting, we passed.  The drinks were reasonably priced, the crowd was very mixed from North Central College kids (I&#39;m assuming) in their early 20s-baby boomer age.  You could hear the band playing from downstairs upstairs, so we decided to head down there to check them out on our way out since we paid for them anyway.  They played till about 1:30... lively crowd, great people watching!
I will definitely return...that upstairs seating &amp; bar is a nice place to hangout for sure!"

I love how you get a carafe of water at the table.

We were disappointed in the menu. The selection was small a few fried apps, a few salads , burgers or a few beef type sandwiches. 

We decided to order an app, then move on.  We ordered the burger cigars. Although they were flavorful, there were room temp, not hot as you would expect an egg roll to be.

I really wanted to like this place, but overall just meh.  There are plenty of places in downtown Naperville that I would prefer."

I liked the decor in the place. Its welcoming for everyone. We were a group of people, there were also families there, and people on dates, younger and older people. 

The seating was great- tables are spread out nicely so you aren&#39;t on top of another table. They have carafes of water at every table which I really liked. 

I looked over the menu and it&#39;s not a huge selection, so I opted for the G.O.A.T burger and got the wildflower cocktail. 

The wildflower cocktail was really good and really strong! So I only opted for one of these since I was going to have to drive home- but If I wasn&#39;t driving I would have had plenty more because they were so good! 

The G.O.A.T burger - was AMAZING!! I could not craft a better burger in my mind. I will dream about this burger! I HIGHLY recommend this one- although all the burgers
Looked great- I seriously can&#39;t imagine a burger better than the G.O.A.T! 

I then split a dessert with the people at my table- which they serve these fresh made, still warm, delicious donuts. You have to get these!! As delicious as you are imagining them- they are better. 

Our server was very attentive, the place was very clean and not crammed, and the food was AMAZING. I would highly recommend this place, and I will definitely be back!"

This business was marketed to the City of Naperville as a family oriented place to eat and have fun, not a late nite rowdy place like Black Finn or what Bar Louie and Rizzo&#39;s used to be.
We shall see. The d√©cor is cold and sterile. We like Pinot Grigio, the house selection was awful, overpriced and a short serve. Food menu very limited and plebian.
Finally, the bartender made us feel like she could care less if we were there.
First impression: not good. Will not go back and have shared our experience with friends and family. We dine out at least 5 days / week in Naperville."

The restaurant ambiance is nice. Unfortunately,  not one of the waitstaff had their hair pulled back. We had to be the unfortunate ones to have the waitress with hair longest to her waist..thereby getting in every course of our meal. I tried to be patient in hopes that she would recognize on her own that her hair was sitting in our plates at every turn. Her lack of concern and everyone working with her including the management implies this is BUSINESS AS USUAL. TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE!

When she handed me my main entr√©e 6 inches of her hair was completely in my plate. I told her &#34;your hair in IN MY FOOD&#34; ..IT HAS BEEN THROUGHOUT every single plate. Her response was &#34;I am sorry I will have another one made&#34;

I got up to use the restroom and she was telling her coworkers whose hair was not pulled back either ..that b!tch says apparently my hair was in her food while laughing and was doing something gross  to the original burger. I told her, please just forget it. I found the manager while the waitress was still was bad mouthing me.  The manager was apologetic and said he would look at the bill. He ended up taking off my burger which he should have as I did not eat..and we paid the rest of the tab which also had her hair as a condiment. I took pictures but will spare you the disgust.  

Do yourself a favor and avoid this establishment.  I guess until the health department gets in there and holds them accountable..you can expect HAIR in your meal. 

I am utterly disappointed, disgusted and still nauseous. 

If there were negative stars, it would be most appropriate."

So we decided to try out Empire, which is new and right around the corner.  The space is absolutely beautiful, the huge glass upper patio, the view over the river and even the inside was really nice.  It&#39;s very obvious that this was not an inexpensive remodel, this was a complete overhaul.  
Now on to the food, I was a little surprised at how small the menu is, but I went with a burger, which if you follow me on Yelp, you know is my go to item for new places.  The menu at Empire is very burger-centric anyhow, so it seemed like a good choice.  I went with a standard cheeseburger, they have several other burgers on the menu, but none really sounded all that good to me.  Burgers are served on a pretzel bun and the one I had was cooked just right and tasted great.  Fries are just okay, pretty standard frozen spuds, fresh cut would have been better, but they were fine.  Service was also fine, nothing to get excited about, but not bad or anything.  This is more of an adult type of place, I didn&#39;t see any kids running around, which was nice.  All in all a nice addition to downtown Naperville and a great location with a beautiful view."

Many of these reviews are about the service, the rooftop, and the decor but few people have mentioned the food. 

The food is, in a word, horrendous. 

It&#39;s greasy, unimaginative, and lacking in flavor. 

For example, I ordered the pork belly Cobb salad. It&#39;s supposed to come with a sunny side egg on top. It came with a rubbery over cooked mess instead. The romaine lettuce seemed more like iceberg and there was a handful of orange shredded cheese from a bag dumped on top. Why??? The pork was cold, greasy, and inedible. 

My husband had a burger with chorizo meat that lacked spice, let alone flavor. It was covered in a greasy cheese like substance that seemed to glow from across the table. 

Between the two of us I think we took 4-5 bites. With drinks and probably the weirdest appetizer I&#39;ve ever had (burger cigars - kind of like deep fried burger egg rolls?) it came out to be the most expensive meal we never ate ($58 + tip). 

Despite the fact we ate very little of this meal, we were nevertheless plagued by indigestion through the night...

The server was nice, though seemed nervous. The drinks were good - the bar menu is plentiful. Nevertheless, we will not be returning to Empire."

Went there to celebrate my birthday and all we got was terrible service. Even when we spoke to the manager, he was very condescending and did not know how to handle the situation. 

My husband had my friends waiting/ saving  a table as a surprise. When we went to go upstairs we were told &#34; no more people are going upstairs&#34; very rudely might I add. The rude bouncer claim to be at max capacity even though our friends had a table with a couple seats waiting for us. Once the manager came, we told him it was my birthday and we picked this place to have a good night. He was also very rude and not once apologized. He made us get a friend come down stairs, I guess to prove that we had a table. 

We were a younger crowd compare to the people there, mid 20s and the age discrimination was real. We were sitting on the patio and waited to be serve when we saw a waitress serve the tables around us their drinks and even watch her take orders. When we flagged her down she rudely told us they do not have service at this area even though all 9 of us clearly saw her serve and wait on other people. Very sad to say we also heard her tell the table behind us how, &#34; she didn&#39;t trust people her age.&#34; Wow age discrimination much. Her loss we are all really good tippers. Especially since we actually had a few experienced servers with us who understand the struggle of being a server. 


So only go here if you are older because if not you will not be taken seriously. I guess when you are in your mid-late 20s your are not a appreciated customer here. Very disappointed because this place really could have been our new go to bar."

Otherwise... revamp your hostess counter or train them on how to calculate wait times and customer service.

My cousin and I came in at 7 pm on Saturday and asked to sit up on the roof given the wait time wasn&#39;t crazy (it wasn&#39;t super busy). The hostess told us 30 minutes, so we went up to the roof to grab drinks while we waited. 

2 hrs later... 

We were having fun with just the two of us but realized it was late and we still haven&#39;t been sat. 

We download the app to check our wait in line... there are still 6 people ahead of us! We go down to talk to the hostess and see many tables open downstairs so we explain we have been waiting for two hours and would like to sit downstairs.

She tells us we need to get on the inside wait list... then a guy from upstairs comes down tells the hostess there&#39;s an open table and he wants it because he&#39;s been waiting (behind us) and she gives him the table. 

It was so messed up! Anyways, we ask to be seated given all the open tables and she reluctantly does... because there was a 30 min wait for downstairs... again lots of open tables.

@#%&amp; you. 

Anyway, our server comes and we explain we would like to speak to the manager (a total waste of time).

He comes by and tells us he will talk to the hostess and never comes back. Our meal is done  (the burgers were good). 
I see him and say &#34;excuse me&#34; and he answers &#34;YEAH?&#34;

&#34;YEAH?&#34; - CAN&#39;T MAKE IT UP IF I TRIED. 

I said &#34;you were going to come back after talking to the hostess and never did&#34;

He says &#34;oh, okay. I&#39;ll give you two free drinks&#34;

Well we didn&#39;t want two drinks just some kind of sympathy to our situation! Our server took our drinks off our tab because she knew we were done for the night. 

She is awesome. 

Terrible management and the blonde short haired hostess is a total nightmare.

Drink prices are below city prices so that&#39;s a plus!"

The servers are trying to work their way through the people waiting. I did not get the young man&#39;s name bringing out food but he was working very hard. One of the hostesses was great and knew her job the other young women were rude. The entrance is also an exit. It was not safe at all for staff trying to bring food to diners.

We were told we had a 20 min wait which turned into 50 mins. After a 30  min. wait I checked to see approximately how much longer our wait would be and the hostess said 30 to 45 mins ...want to cancel? WOW not great for business.

Once we were seated our waitress did not know we had been seated. We waited 10 more mins to order drinks. We ordered our food. Awhile later 5 to 10 mins later my friend was told they didn&#39;t get their delivery of her choice of meat. Shouldn&#39;t the servers be told this before the evening starts? Or updated as they run out of food? The menu is limited. It should not be difficult to update staff. 

Our burgers were terrible, very greasy. The grease ran down my hand. I couldn&#39;t even eat most of my meal. The waitress only checked on us once about 3 minutes after we got our food. She never came back to offer refills. I don&#39;t blame her she was very busy.

The servers and waitresses seemed over worked. More staff is needed. 

Cannot recommend this place. I had high hopes for Empire. I enjoy Ballydoyle whenever I have been there. My friend did enjoy her cocktail. 

When we were leaving there was a flat bed truck and a man  delivering ice to Empire from a cooler into ice buckets. Naperville Health and Fire Departments, Official&#39;s where are and we&#39;re you?....shame.....shame....shame"

Dinner options included a few interesting appetizers, burgers which were well enjoyed by others and a few salads. My selection, the shredder, a salad with shredded kale, walnuts and strawberries with a cut up chicken filet along with poppyseed dressing; was PERFECT on a warmer summer evening. 

Later on we enjoyed an alluring upstairs component over a few cocktails. It was inclusive of a fully stocked bar and seating areas which feature a glimpse of the the river view (which will only improve overtime as projects are completed) while upstairs you can dine from a patio position or at the bar or table positions from beneath the retractable glass roof!?!?

We went here to celebrate a family member&#39;s birthday, party of 10. As our group started to trickle in just before 9pm, we noticed one of our family members didn&#39;t make it upstairs. I asked why and they said because he was in athletic attire. Mind you, he was wearing nice athletic attire, not straight-out-of-the-gym clothes. When I looked around, more than half of the men were in flip flops, tank tops, practically beach wear, which rightfully so because it&#39;s been so hot out... But they got into the bar, not my cousin. And I watched some of them walk into the bar after us! So I asked my husband to see what&#39;s going and bring him in, eventually, he did get in. I wanted to speak to the manager and as soon as I found him, I preceded to tell him what happened and a bouncer rudely interjected in my conversation and said, oh yeah that young guy, I rejected him. I asked why and he first said &#34;we have a dress code, no athletic wear and men&#39;s tanks&#34; and I proceeded to tell him there is plenty of that in the bar, so why couldn&#39;t my cousin get in. Then the bouncer said, it&#39;s a Naperville establishment policy, I asked him if he knows where I can find that and he said &#34;it&#39;s actually an unwritten rule&#34;. Then I said that that just sounds discriminating since there are many people in your establishment that you did not enforce this &#34;policy&#34; on. BTW- I couldn&#39;t find this &#34;policy&#34; ANYWHERE. Then the bouncer said, well I have the right to refuse service to anyone. And I asked him, &#34;based on what? When my Caucasian husband came down to get my cousin (who is Asian) you had NO issues with letting him in.&#34; Bouncer stated, &#34;well then, I&#39;m not doing my job right.&#34; All of this on front of the manager, no peep out of him.

We love Naperville, family and friends all over this town. It is such a shame that this kind of establishment treats their customers this way. I should of read the bad reviews and skipped this place. This situation was so disturbing it prompted me to write my first Yelp review ever to warn others. We were looking for a good time, which we had eventually, but not with the help of this establishment. If any management reads these bad reviews, I would suggest you reevaluate your staff&#39;s attitudes. Clearly, we are not the first who encountered this based on other reviews. And per other reviewers, I too wish I could give negative stars! There are plenty of other places in Naperville that are worthy of your business. Empire should not be one of them."

Empire is a great atmosphere for all ages including the college kids at night. Naperville needed a place like this! Forget all these reviews of people all overreacting about small things. This place is the place to be! To the great food, the endless variety of drink choices, to the friendly service! Been there three times; Britney, Sidney, and Nick were my servers all attentive and outgoing! Take one thing of advice at least: try the donuts! They are heavenly!"

Upscale bar food, which I&#39;m sure is all the norm in hip Chicago neighborhoods, but totally lacking in Naperville. This type of restaurant was very needed in the downtown Naperville scene and I hope it remains for a long time. I&#39;ve been to Empire 3 times now and have brought new people each time. Every single person at the table, each time we&#39;ve been, has loved their food. 

I&#39;m told the beer menu is great (I don&#39;t drink beer) and the wine selection is above average (not something you expect from a typical burger bar). Downstairs is dark and industrial and can get pretty loud. They have a stage for a band, but I have not been there when there was live music. Upstairs there is an indoor/outdoor area. The glass panels can open on nice days, or close on hot days. If the doors are closed and the sun is out (glass panel ceiling), it can get VERY hot, as air flow is seriously lacking. They also have a full outdoor patio on the river that I have not experienced yet. 

While the food is well above average, the service is not. The waitresses (we&#39;ve only seen females) appear unaware of the ever-changing beer menu and are generally not knowledgeable about the beers they serve. They also seem unaware of the offerings of the restaurant - for example, I asked for a side salad instead of fries and received it on my first and second visit. On the third visit, the waitress told me &#34;they don&#39;t do that&#34;. I explained that I had it before and received my salad. I firmly believe this is simply due to the restaurant being in its infancy, and have faith that they will weed out the bad servers and develop a consistent server base. 

When we did have an issue with the service, managers came by and compensated us for the inconveniences we experienced, restoring our faith in the restaurant as a whole. Overall, I will definitely be back and will continue to bring new people, so long as the service continues to improve (as I have seen it do in the three successive visits thus far)."

The place has so much potential... we went there on Saturday. it was pretty crowded but not packed. There were a couple of things that stood out form me. First of all i waited at the bar for almost 25 minutes just to get a drink.  the staff seemed disorganized. also there was no music. like total silence. One of the tvs above the bar was on  and showing Walking Dead. the rail for the retractable roof was not covered and it is a huge tripping hazard if you are wearing heels. all in all the place was nice to look at but I don&#39;t think we are coming back anytime soon.

I don&#39;t even know where to begin......  We got to the place on a Saturday around 5 pm before a movie.  The place wasn&#39;t crowded and we were seated right away.  Then we proceed to wait 10-15 minutes as servers are walking around looking at each other before someone finally came to the table.  Then she asks if we were waiting long and when we said we were she said,&#34; I&#39;m sorry. No one told me you were seated&#34;.  As I said before servers are walking around looking at each other. 
So....   Family of 4.  We order 3 burgers and a salad.  There are no substitutions on the menu yet 3 out of the 4 orders come wrong.  The salad was ordered without tomatoes but it came with tomatoes.  So when we send it back it comes back without dressing.  Others at the table food is getting cold while we wait for the right orders.   Then the waitress says I&#39;m sorry and then walks away while we wait some more for the runner to bring the food.   After the food arrives finally, the waitress comes back again and passes us off to another waitress. 
The new waitress was nice but didn&#39;t ask if we wanted more drinks or anything.  We had to flag her down.   After all this she brings the check and it was 81.00 !!!!  Before tip !! Yes !!!  81.00 for 3 burgers, a salad, and three soft drinks.   Then she apologizes for the problems.  As we are sitting there the manager is circling the table but never stops. So we finally leave and as we are walking out we stop to tell the manager that they have a lot of work to do.  We start to tell her the problems and she says sorry like she could care less !!!!  I know. If you are tired of reading this, I am tired of writing this.  DO YOURSELF A FAVOR. DON&#39;T GO !!!   There are great places to spend your money in downtown Naperville.

My advice would be to dine in on the first floor, and then take a walk upstairs with your cocktail to check out the view. 

Excited to see where Empire is headed with live music starting in a few days. It can only get better!

Food to try- The Shredder (Kale, strawberry, goat cheese salad) or GOAT burger
Drinks- Eli Whitney cocktail and Vanilla BItch Slap! beer.

Service has always been great for us as well. Only complaint is that the wine selection could be much, much better!! Keep up the good work Empire!"

The wait staff was friendly, helpful, and accommodating. A table near ours didn&#39;t love one of their items and I heard their waiter and the manager cheerfully bending over backwards to make them happy and find them something else.

The drinks were fine but a little pricey- ultimately a cool bar scene. The food was definitely average at best, and not worth the $11-18 pricetag on the sandwiches/burgers. My recommendation: stop by Jackson Ave Pub for a good burger, then come by here later in the evening for drinks. 

The architecture and layout was really, really cool. I haven&#39;t seen this unique style in the suburbs, so this made it stand out from other Naperville bars. I really like the open roof concept on the top floor- it has AC and was told it also has heating during colder nights."

We waited forever to put our names in, and then for another hour to get a table. The upstairs patio is very cool, and we managed to grab a table. We considered eating there but the server only visited us maybe twice in the hour we were there. The food and service downstairs was pretty good when we finally got our table. We enjoyed our burgers and left happy. However, I got very sick later that night and I believe I got food poisoning from Empire, so I won&#39;t be returning anytime soon.

If you&#39;re coming for dinner, you might have a little bit of a wait for a table. But they&#39;re a new restaurant and obviously good if there&#39;s a wait, so that&#39;s expected. If you want a shorter wait, put yourself on the first available table list. Most likely you&#39;ll get sat on the main floor which has a cozy ambience. You can instead be put on a wait for upstairs, but you usually end up waiting twice as long. However, while you wait, go upstairs for a drink. They have a beautiful rooftop patio bar and it&#39;s a fun area to relax and it over looks the water. Just a beautiful restaurant and definitely one to check out if you haven&#39;t!

Being a beautiful summer day, we headed to the rooftops do hound seats at the bar. Within seconds we were greeted by Ryan and had a cold beer in front of us. First thing about the eye-popping roof is that when the sun is out you cook!  It was so hot, I can&#39;t tell you, but luckily we ended with some cloud cover and they closed off a portion and turned on air which made a huge impact. If you don&#39;t like heat, stay off the rooftop!
Decor was awesome, first level bar is impressive and the stage is ample sized for bands that are rumored to start around Labor Day. The beer selection is very solid, and we tried several beers we had not even heard of before. Bartenders Ryan and Tyler were awesome and knew their beers and food. We are several things, all delivered efficiently and were tasty. The burger cigars are a must try!! The burger was very good and a nice size along with homemade fries that were awesome. Prices are typical of downtown Naperville. It is obvious they need more bar backs, table cleaning/prep personnel, etc as we observed messy areas sitting way too long as new patrons arrived. Sometimes the cheapest labor can be the most important!  Overall, we were very impressed with all aspects of the place. I hope they tie up some loose ends with the tv&#39;s, roof issue (tint perhaps?) and staffing, but given the owners track record with the other Ballydoyle locations, I&#39;m sure they will!"

Instead of apologizing and trying to accommodate us she blamed us for not checking the app. This contained to be an ordeal for a half hour and no one knew what was going on.

The space is super cool, lots of exposed brick and that &#34;established old building&#34; feel, but with cool updated urban touches.
On the main floor there&#39;s a decent sized stage, a balcony-type deck overlooking the river and a good sized bar, plus lots booths and room for seating. 
Head upstairs and not only is there a glass enclosed rooftop bar area, but an indoor lounge-y area with nail-head studded leather chairs and metal accents. It looked comfortable for men and ladies alike.
The night we went, the place was filled with revelers with newly-minted ID&#39;s, but I suspect as time goes by the crowd will level out a little more with some more established people.
We couldn&#39;t get a bartenders&#39; attention upstairs and eventually gave up and headed downstairs for a drink where it was less crowded. 
Pros: Drink strength was acceptable. Excellent to look at. Great location. Glass rooftop deck. River deck.
Cons: Ladies bathroom has a window facing the busy street. Rooftop bar has blind-side where bartenders won&#39;t see you
Overall - I recommend this spot and look forward to trying it again, maybe with food this time."

Even though it was packed, service was prompt and very polite. We had the hamburger cigars and Scottish egg for apps-both very good-and more than we expected!  For dinner we had a caprese salad and a goat cheese burger-again, both were excellent!"
empire-naperville-3,Jim J.,IaCrdO80MUoYaPPymqwZrQ,"Naperville, IL",0,1,0,15,1,aXcaTLaGcG1al_RKphsKeA,2.0,2016-08-29,"We wanted to wait a few months before dining at Empire to give them the chance to &#34;work the bugs out&#34; of their system. Apparently it didn&#39;t matter. The rooftop dining is the best aspect of this place, and that&#39;s really just a gimmick. What really matters, service and the food, leave a lot to be desired. We entered Empire and were greeted by an empty hostess stand and a sign that said &#34;please wait to be seated&#34;.  So we waited.  And waited some more. This was odd, because the restaurant was virtually empty. When the cute little blonde hostess did finally decide to return, we asked to be seated rooftop. The hostess told us there was a separate stand upstairs for that, and that we needed to go upstairs to that station to be seated. So we walked up the two flights of stairs, only to be told there was at least a 30 minute wait for rooftop dining, but that we could be seated immediately downstairs, in the bar or on the patio. So we trekked back down the stairs to the original hostess to be seated. As we reached the stand, the phone was ringing, so we had to stand there for several minutes while the hostess spoke on the phone. She wouldn&#39;t even acknowledge us while she conducted her conversation. Even a nod in our direction would have meant something.  Would it be too difficult for the two seating stations to communicate so that people weren&#39;t sent all over the restaurant to be seated?  A warm welcome costs nothing. The kind of welcome we received shows an appalling lack of customer service. We&#39;d been in a virtually empty restaurant almost 15 minutes so far, and couldn&#39;t buy a seat. And we faced a hostess who couldn&#39;t seem to care less whether we dined at Empire or not. We were finally seated on the patio at a cramped little table that was ill equipped to handle the serving plates for two diners. We feared making any fast moves that might send things like salt and pepper shakers hurling to their deaths in the DuPage River. Not the most comfortable of seating. The wait staff was a vast improvement over the host staff, and is the only reason this restaurant got any stars at all. Both the ladies who waited on us were friendly and efficient. The menu was a joke, however. Mostly burgers, with a few sandwiches and salads. Appetizers that were mostly deep fried and/or greasy. Not much on the menu was innovative, unless you consider Pimiento Cheese to be cutting edge. Menu prices aren&#39;t cheap. Burgers ranging from $14-$18 each should offer something more than what you can get for less money elsewhere. Our bill came to $68 for two appetizers, two burgers, two soft drinks and one bag of doughnuts.  While we are glad we tried Empire, we won&#39;t return.  This place has been open less than three months and the service and menu already need a complete overhaul. Don&#39;t bother..."

Empty Sunday night bar, poor service and over priced food while lacking quality. I didn&#39;t get the burger I ordered, it was acknowledged by our waitress yet nothing was done about it.  It was completely over cooked and served with cold fries. I get they have new servers, maybe lacking experience but it&#39;s give the management team ZERO excuse for not coming to check on the 7 tables that are actually sat in the place. At the end, she drops off the check with an $18 burger on it, that I didn&#39;t order. Again, more of the same from Bally Doyle&#39;s."

We live a couple of blocks from this place and have been their 3 times since they opened seeing if they had the kinks worked out yet.  first time was probably the best but the waitress (who was also busing the tables) had no clue what was on the menu.  ok fin its a new place I get it....  trip two they didn&#39;t know how to make a sex on the beach and when told that there was no pineapple juice in the drink the waiter returned with a glass of pineapple juice in a separate glass and then charged us $3 for the pineapple juice?!?!?  Third time was later in the night.  you could see that the bar was only half full but there was a line around the corner.  the door man was only letting one group in every 5 minutes or so.  when we got up to the front of the line a couple of girls walked up to the bouncer and said we know the manager can you let us in.  he said that the manager they were talking about wasn&#39;t working that night so they would have to go to the back of the line.  they whispered something in the guys ear and he let them in immediately.  I am a local and love most of the places in town.  we are down there almost every day.  I was really looking forward to this new place opening and the design is fantastic but the management and staff are clueless.  I will probably try again in a few months if they&#39;re still open but for now three strikes and you&#39;re out.

We ordered a round of drinks, and when we went to place our order, they told us they were out of something we wanted. We ordered twice more, with five minutes of discussion in between, and each time the waitress came back she told us they were out of the items we ordered, instead of just telling us from the start what they didn&#39;t have. I understand it&#39;s new and they are trying to get the kinks out but she should have told us from the start if they were out of three menu items, especially when the menu is so small to start with. Two people in our party got splinters from the table, and an overpriced cocktail we ordered wasn&#39;t even filled to the top of the glass. Another note: the menu is very small, under 15 items, and you cannot do any substations with any items. Pretty disappointing, will maybe give it another shot in the distant future."

The place is really just a bar with a very limited bar menu of 5 sandwich and salad offerings and assorted burgers. Pricey and unremarkable. Unbelievably they serve Arizona ice tea from the bottle, nothing home brewed here !!

The rooftop was fun, lively, and had a beautiful view with the atrium open. We had the Tots (amazing with a nice little spicy kick). My friend has the Yardbird, and I had the Big Dipper, both of which we enjoyed. The beer selection was excellent with many local craft beers on tap, and our server was friendly, attentive, and helpful. The crowd was all ages from families with kids, to mid 20&#39;s up to mid 50&#39;s all co-mingling is a nice setting on a beautiful Friday night.

I don&#39;t eat red meat and knew the place was a burger bar, but decided to stop in and see the menu anyway to find they do have chicken options, although you wouldn&#39;t have gotten that information from the hostess.  She didn&#39;t know what was on the menu, just said there were burgers.  We decided to try it, wanted to sit upstairs so she sent us up the the hostess there.  We were seated right away.  Our waitress was nice and quick with drinks and ordering.  That&#39;s where everything went south.  My husband ordered the Empire burger that comes with a fried egg.  The burger was over-cooked, dry and not juicy and the egg was cooked hard.  I had the Yardbird, decided to eat it with a fork and knife because it come with two chicken strips and it falls apart, it was good except for the added paper wrapper I uncovered under a piece of the chicken after I was almost done.  My son&#39;s cheeseburger was overcooked and dry as well.  They discounted my husband&#39;s burger by half and took a couple dollars off my chicken sandwich.  It would have been $43 for 2 burgers, chicken sandwich and one coke if they hadn&#39;t discounted it to $23.  Overpriced IMO and I don&#39;t mind paying more for good food.  Won&#39;t go back to eat, maybe have drinks on the rooftop."

The rooftop seating overlooking the river is what grabbed our attention, but once I saw the menu I knew we&#39;d have to give it a try because my husband loves burgers (especially on pretzel buns). When we walked in we were impressed with the look of everything (very industrial and in with the current trends) but once we heard the 30 minute wait for the rooftop we decided to dine inside. We were seated at a high top table where there was very dim lighting, making it hard to see the menu. About 10 minutes passed and no server had come to greet us or take our drink orders. Finally, the one server we saw working the floor came and asked if we had been seen. After we said no, she said she would go get our server, but then came back and said she would just be helping us. I ordered a pumpkin beer, but was unfortunately brought the wrong one and it took some time for our server to come back for me to let her know. Once I did tell her, she was quickly apologetic and brought me the correct beer with a glass. Food came out quickly and was pretty good. My husband had the Key West burger and said it was good, but the turkey burger itself definitely wasn&#39;t freshly made and we could tell it was just a frozen patty. I had the knockwurst sandwich (sauce was a little spicy) and it was cut into smaller pieces which made it hard to keep on the pretzel bun. We ordered the doughnuts (best part of the meal) and got much more than we expected. Overall, the complaints about poor service are true (but I must say our server did as best she could to make up for that), food was okay (not worth the high prices), beer selection is good, but I doubt we will be back. This is a huge place and they can definitely afford more staffing. I could point out the manager and wished he would have jumped in to help out rather than walk around checking on everyone (which he didn&#39;t stop at our table to ask how everything was)."

Twenty year resident of Naperville and dine downtown frequently at everything from Sullivans and Catch 35 to Jimmys and The Lantern. On a positive note, they have a good beer offering - on tap and bottled. Many opportunities for improvement though. Food quality was real bad. Everything was served cold. Ordered burgers and they came quickly. Nonetheless, it&#39;s as if they were lying around and toppings were added as soon as we ordered them. How could a burger be ordered, delivered in minutes and served cold? These are not fresh hand made burgers. We are talking 1/3 pound disks circa your bag of Costco burgers. As for the fries, they were equally as cold. Imagine the broken up fry tidbits at the bottom of your bag of fries in the freezer....Serve them at colder then room temperature and you have Empire. So disappointing. $87.69 was the bill...My wife and I had two burgers and fries, appetizers, two drinks each and we tipped 20%. Go anywhere else in downtown Naperville for a better burger."

We usually go for hibachi to enjoy the show but the last few hibachi times, the food quality and show have been lackluster. The last couple of visits we switched to standard dining and have enjoyed that experience much more.

They have had a groupon available if you&#39;re planning on visiting.  We did hear a waitress the last time we were there complaining about people who use the groupon. I&#39;m guessing patrons are forgetting to tip off the check total before the discount, but regardless, that isn&#39;t something that should be heard in the dining area."

Had an excellent filet! Very tender and tasty!  Yes the brews were pricey but I knew that going in after reading reviews here. The Sapporos were 4.75 but next time I&#39;m going to get the 40 o z tall boys for 8 &amp; change- more bang for the buck! Service was good, if we needed something we flagged the guy down, no biggie. Sake shots jacked me up. They weren&#39;t watered down. Yes you will get some on you so wear a bib or hold a plate under you or just say no. Filet was 24ish but again very good. I would go back had some good times there!"

We order the steak and teriyaki &amp; chicken and teriyaki.  The steak and chicken had no flavor at all, some salt or any spices would have been good. The teriyaki did not have the best flavor either. Was really hoping this would be a place to come back to but we will not be returning. On the way out, we stopped at the euro deli in the same strip mall and got a couple breaded pork patties. We enjoyed them better!"

I love it here and go with friends and family and everyone always enjoys it. I come in alone often to get sushi, it is probably the best in this area! 

I always get the Filet Hibachi with the garlic noodles. It can get pricey here, but it&#39;s worth it. They always are on Groupon, but they are really strict about their Groupons and basically attack you to show it the second you step in the restaurant. They also don&#39;t let you use more than one so even in a large group, only 1 person can use theirs. Good luck deciding who gets to! 

The Hibachi comes with their clear soup (so good) and their salad with ginger dressing which is really good as well. It comes with veggies and each person gets 2 shrimp. Their white seafood sauce is the best! Really delicious. 

As for sushi, I always get their spicy California roll. Reasonably priced, fresh and delicious. I like to get their veggie tempura appetizer too, the vegetables all taste amazing. 

My one complaint is service can be pretty slow. I also am not one to participate in the saki squirting or catching food in my mouth and they can be pretty pushy about it. However, this is a super fun place especially for a large group. Make sure to make a reservation!"

Their sushi, sashimi and hand rolls are always fresh and just so delish!

The hibachi table is a good choice if you&#39;re with a decent amount of people. They cook the food right in front of you &amp; it is very entertaining.

Truth is my family and I have been coming here for over 4 years and we have always been happy with the food and service we have received, I even threw 2 parties of over 30 people here, but I must say that last Sunday my family and I went there an hour before closing a total of 10 ppl and the service was less than poor. We sat at the Habachi table and the food was way too salty and no other flavor other that soy sauce. We got less that half a cup of rice and about 1/4 cup of veggies. Now if you&#39;ve ever gone to a Habachi grill you know that you usually get ALOT of rice and veggies with your order. This time we got nothing for the high price we paid and the staff was making sure we were aware that hey we&#39;re ready to leave.  Now I called the next day to complain about the service food quality and portion and was told that hey would take care of it and we would get a gift card for our trouble, well today we received a $40 dollar card which for a bill of 350.00 is nothing they basically gave us back our tip. Well to the management thank you hit no thank you! I will be returning it as probably need it more than we do. Not to sound snotty but this is really unfortunate to one of your one time customers. Hopefully you never to this again to any customer."

Good food, HORRIBLE experience. The service was horrible, from having to repeat what we wanted to eat, to trying to convince the server that we COULD order something on the menu (she kept saying they don&#39;t have that, my husband had to show her on the menu). She only saw us once after we ordered and got salad and soups. She never cleared, manager had to come start it, then server runs up freaking out. We ask for box, and we get that.  Wait for 10 minutes after for check, my husband has card out she she takes it immediately. 15 minutes later, we have not even seen her. I go looking for her, don&#39;t find her but another server asks if I need help, manager shows up I just say we need our receipt and card back.  

Another few minutes, server shows up...asking did we need something, did we need dessert? I say, ummm, no, you have our card, we just want our receipt and card back. She does not understand. 

Then a few more minutes and the manager comes up and hands the check to the other party at our table, turns to leave.  We ask where is our check?  She looks baffled, says hold on. She shows back up super quick and (up to this point has been quiet and polite) she says loudly, so everyone can hear...OUR CARD WAS DECLINED, TWICE.  my husband shakes his head, then pulls up our back app and shows her the balance on our debit card. He even dbl checks to see he gave her that card. Manager then says NO SIR, YOUR CARD IS NOT GOOD, WE NEED ANOTHER CARD.  my husband shakes his head again, and just hands her another card. I am worried. We have money in that account, what is going on.  Husband says he&#39;ll call bank. Manager comes back. Quietly a pagan, and says gee, that one worked.  As we are leaving we call bank.  THEY NEVER RAN THE CARD, THERE WERE NO DELINES, NO TRIES EVEN ON THAT CARD ALL THAT DAY.  

Never once did I or my husband raise our voices, nor were we rude or anything else. My husband just shook his head in disbelief is the on,y show of emotion. 

So instead of admitting that they either lost our card, or just forgot, they tried to humiliate us. Nice."

We had the Hibachi dinner and I would suggest sitting down and watch your meal being cooked, good fun! They make it fun watching your meal being cooked, I would recommend not letting the chef squirt saki at you, very messy! Watch first before you partake in that fun, if you feel you can withstand the onslaught, go for it!
 The meal was very good and flavorful, i would suggest ordering two main courses, I just ordered the steak and wished I would of got shrimp or lobster also. The chef did throw me a couple extra shrimp and it was very tasty!

I&#39;ve been to a couple different hibachi restaurants so we decided to give this a try. It wasn&#39;t super fancy but better than I expected. Didn&#39;t seem dirty to me. The wait staff was wonderful and our server/cook was hilarious. I usually don&#39;t care for the salad that is served because the dressing has too much ginger but their dressing was delicious. The food was cooked perfectly and flavorful. Another reviewer said they go crazy on the teriyaki but I didn&#39;t feel that way. The only problem we had was that some of the food we ordered wasn&#39;t made. I ordered filet mignon and scallops and my husband ordered filet and chicken. The cook seemed flustered at one point and he said something to the waiter. My husband and I each got our steak but not the other food. Then he cleaned the grill. I was disappointed and couldn&#39;t figure out why we didn&#39;t get all our food. My husband mentioned it to the waiter and he said Someone was bringing it. So we did end up getting it but afterwords. It wasn&#39;t the cooks fault as he just cooks what&#39;s on the platter. So I realized that&#39;s why he panicked a bit. He saw that he was missing food. It would have been nice to eat that with the rest of the meal. We will definitely try again. Just hoping that was a one time mistake.

I had never had sushi before and neither had my mother. Or my 7 month old. I don&#39;t know, I felt like I should add that as there may be some very adventurous infants out there who have or may be considering it?
Arrived at about 5pm on a Saturday. It was not busy. There were a couple hibachi tables going and some people in the sushi side of the restaurant. We sat at a hibachi table.
My brother ordered a bunch of sushi and said it was very good. I know he got a Rainbow roll that he enjoyed. We also ordered a Godzilla roll that was very good. My mom ordered a sweet potato roll that was delicious as well. My son had some of that and enjoyed it. So his first foray into sushi was a success.
The waiter was helpful and patient in explaining how the ordering works. I got shrimp hibachi with chicken friend rice. The hibachi cook was friendly and funny and generous and accurate with the sake but terrible with his broccoli launching aim. 
Everyone&#39;s food was great. It was very tasty. 

Overall we had a great time. Next time I think I&#39;ll skip the hibachi and try more sushi instead but I was glad to finally dip my toes into the water!"

I could understand if we didn&#39;t make a reservation, and had walked in with a party of 20 but I did make a reservation. Our service did improve but I had to speak to two different people first.

The waitress stood and looked at my husband and I for several minutes before I waved her over asking for drinks and our sushi order. Which we repeated 3 times. Our sushi was wonderful as always. Again after people were seated we are still waiting for the table to fill before they take a complete order. I get that but she really was not a good waitress. I felt bad that she couldn&#39;t understand us but at the same time I was having a anniversary dinner and it took forever. But as always all food but the soup was not great.

The sushi is pretty good here. I suggest the Romeo &amp; Juliet roll. It&#39;s cute andd it tastes pretty good.

Hibachi is pretty good too. They do charge extra for toppings like the egg yolk sauce which I thought was not cool. I do suggest getting their noodles instead of their rice. It&#39;s kind of garlicky and I like it a lot. 

The hibachi chef likes to squirt watered down sake down your throat and kind of makes you messy. I feel like that the hibachi chefs have a funny young way about them and is best for younger adult crowds. They sometimes even seemed hurried all the time and just want to get your dinner over with. 

Because of the chef thing I  have to put 3-stars. I like neat tricks and chefs that make you feel welcomed whether you are a child or a senior citizen and NOT in a hurry."

We have only been to the Romeoville Location, but have been there several times. Besides great food Aodake has offers a bit of fun to your meal. I feel that their prices are also a little bit more reasonable than some other Japanese Steak Houses that we have been to.

Aodake is pronounced ah-oh da&#39; key and besides typical Japanese Steak House food they also have sushi and great appetizers. We are not into Sushi but we have ordered one of their Tempura Appetizers and it was delicious.

We go to Aodake for the Japanese Steak house experience where your food is cooked on a big grill in front of you. the cooks are excellent and do a few fun things like flipping zucchini to you, to see if you can catch it in your mouth. They also will squirt rice wine in your mouth but if you are not interested you can just say no. I do not drink alcohol but my son has done it on occasion. I am not a big fan of this practice but a lot of people really enjoy it.

We like to go to Aodake for lunch and they have a special happy hour menu. You can get any of the meals and it seems to save you about $3. You do have to offer a beverage with it, but most people will do that anyway. The only difference that I have noticed with the happy hour menu is that they leave out the bean sprouts.

The first course is a bowl of soup. It is a light broth with a few mushrooms and some onions. The soup is yummy and a nice start to the meal.Next they bring out the salads which are individually made and have their own special dressing. The dressing is unique to these type of restaurants and the closest thing I can think of is Thousand Island. We all love the little salads.

Everyone is given regular silver wear, as well as wood chop sticks. I like to use the chop sticks to get the full experience.

Each meal comes with fried rice which is delicious. I can not eat fried rice because I am on a low carb diet so I just order and extra portion of vegetables and find it very filling without going over on my carbs.After the salads the cook comes out and starts making your meal. Each person will get a shrimp appetizer plus whatever they ordered. I usually get shrimp so I just get a couple extra. My daughter loves to get the steak and chicken and my husband gets the steak and scallops. I have tasted all of them and they use high quality meats.

While the chef is cooking he will usually put on a bit of a show with eggs, fire just some fun. You will not be disappointed in the fun, the food or the reasonable prices."

We sat down and I asked where the lunch menu was and they said that we had to order off the regular menu since we had a groupon.  We explained that I was on a different check and they still said since I walked in with them and sat at the same table I had to order off the regular dinner menu.  There was another couple that came in about 5mins after us and they gave them the lunch menu.  I asked about that and the manager asked if  I wanted to sit  at another table?  It is almost like they don&#39;t like the groupons.  We used one for my birthday dinner and they didn&#39;t want to let us use it because I forgot to show them when we came in.  They were really busy and I did tell the lady but I don&#39;t think she heard me.  I feel like if they don&#39;t want to work with people with the groupons then maybe they shouldn&#39;t offer it.  We will go back but I wanted to let people know.  Very disappointed.

I was in town for business with 3 other Japanese co-workers who we&#39;re visiting from Japan. We went here based on the yelp reviews but it was a total let down.
No one at this restaurant could speak Japanese when there were questions which should have been a red flag right away. Our waiter told us the owners were Chinese when I asked.
Many of the dishers are no where near authentic, which was disappointing. Katsudon is always made with pork but they had fried oysters instead, WTF? 
Against my better judgement I got a spicy salmon and tuna roll which were not good. 
If you know and eat sushi or anything about Japanese meals go somewhere else or you will leave disappointed."

We were promptly sat on the right side of the room, but our waitress took quite a while to even show up to ask for drinks and throughout the night she was not readily available. In fact, at two points in time we had to get up and get something ourselves or ask another staff for something. 

Now this is one of my friends favorite places for sushi and it was my first time, but I was not impressed. I probably wouldn&#39;t return. We each ordered a garden salad and their house ginger dressing was delicious, but out of the four rolls we ordered to share only one of them was really great. We did also order four different mochi ice cream desserts and those were very good, but other than that I don&#39;t see much that would bring me to this sushi place over my favorite locations."

My husband and I took my sister out for her birthday last night.  Aodake proved to be the right place for the celebration.  

We  showed up 15 minutes early for our res and were sat right away.  We were one of 2 families in the entire place on a thurs night at 5:00.  Our mildly rude first waitress asked if my husband and I could order our food right away so the other family didn&#39;t have to wait long for their entrees.  We asked to be sat separately because we didn&#39;t have time to order our sushi appetizers AND we were still waiting for my sister to arrive.  They moved us and everything was fantastic after that.

We ordered the volcano and the Larry lobster maki rolls to start..so yummy!  The sushi was fresh, presented nicely and didn&#39;t need any soy to taste.  The hibachi entrees were perfection and big-portioned.  Our chef was fantastic and added lots of laughs to our night....Lots of laughs and lots of sake!!  Our server even caught on to my very subtle it&#39;s-my-sisters-birthday hint, and came out banging a drum with a candle on a scoop of complimentary ice cream.  A few servers joined in on singing happy birthday to close out a good night and a great dining experience.

Bill for 3 sans drinks came out to $115.  Make sure to get your groupon ahead of time for $15 off!"

This one has been here for a while and I think the quality has steadily declined over the past couple of years.

We frequent this place maybe once a quarter or so as my wife really likes the hibachi style dinner, so review focuses on the hibachi offering.

As hibachi restaurants go, this is exactly what you expect. You sit around an 8-10 person table, your chef comes and prepares the lion&#39;s share of your meal in front of you on a large flattop.

Hibachi dinner consists of soup, salad, fried rice, vegetables, and your choice of protein. Soup is largely some kind of beef / chicken broth with a dried mushroom floating in it. The salad is iceberg lettuce and a cucoumber slice with a great ginger dressing. At this point in the meal, the chef comes out with all the table&#39;s food on a cart and starts preparing the meal. Most of the time the chefs we seem to get at our table seem to be rather lame, definitely fatigued from catching eggs in their hat and performing the onion volcano 6 nights a week. However, I have realized that the more excitable the crowd at their table is, the more excitable they will get. Your kids will love it though!

As for the food prepared at the table, it&#39;s generally good but inconsistent between chefs. Sometimes you get your vegetables first, sometimes you get your fried rice first, other times we&#39;ve gotten the protein first. I&#39;ve ordered my steak teryaki style before and it&#39;s been prepared without it, when I brought it to the chef&#39;s attention he just squirted some teryaki sauce on my plate. I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve ever had a bad meal here though.

What I do feel though is Groupon has kind of ruined this restaurant. They offer Groupon deals quite frequently, and though it is a good deal, the place has seem to have gone downhill the last year or so. I can&#39;t quite describe it, but it just seems to have gotten &#34;less classy&#34;."

This was my first time at this restaurant and my first time having sushi and I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect.  I was just hoping we wouldn&#39;t have to stop at Wendy&#39;s on the way home!  It took about ten minutes for our waitress to come over and take our drink order.  We ordered an appetizer and our meals.  Probably twenty minutes later our appetizer came out.  We had the spicy salmon which was really good.  I was liking my first sushi experience so far!  About forty minutes after that my boyfriend&#39;s food came out.... but mine didn&#39;t. :(  It was another ten minutes before my food came out.  Kinda weird.  I ordered the Pink Lady and my boyfriend had the green dragon.  I tried his and obviously ate mine and definitely liked the Pink Lady better.  It was also a lot of food, I was only able to eat half of it.  I&#39;d recommend this place but be prepared to wait."

My girlfriend and I dined there on a Sunday and had a terrible experience. After we were seated we hadn&#39;t had anyone come to our table for 20 minutes. Multiple people had been seated after us and had received service before us. Finally after 25 minutes my girlfriend was able to flag another server down from another section who quickly took both our drink and food order. We waited another 10 minutes still no drinks. Not even a single person came by our table to ask how we were doing.  At this point I made my way up front to ask for a manager. Turns out our server was never notified that we were seated in her section. As I walked back to the table I saw our server laughing about the whole situation; for me waiting almost 40 minutes and not even getting water I can&#39;t say I saw the humor in that. The person that took our order previously didn&#39;t even put it in the system so when we got our food you can tell the rolls were made hastily due to the fact that they were falling apart as we grabbed them.  My girlfriend had a Groupon which is the main reason we went, the server took her phone without asking to apply the coupon and then dropped both the bill and the phone at a different table. Needless to say we didn&#39;t leave a tip and we will not be returning. If you&#39;re thinking about going here I&#39;d highly recommend that you don&#39;t."

They had a sashimi bento box but not just a sashimi lunch special. The inside of the restaurant looked very nice.  There are a bunch of hibachi tables which sat about 6-8.

My sashimi entree came with a salad, soup, and rice.  My salad was soaking wet (water) and I found a hair in it.  The miso soup was tasteless.  They gave me soy sauce packets and no cup to dip sashimi in.  The sashimi itself was not cleaned very well and I kept pulling sinew and a bone out of it.  

Save your money and go somewhere else."

The person taking the reservation talked us into coming later than we wanted by promising that we wouldn&#39;t have to wait. 

We arrived at 7:50 P.M. for our 8 P.M. reservation. The place was packed and there was barely anywhere to stand to cheek in. We were told it would be 45 minutes to 1 hour. No apology or anything.  The most annoying thing is that they had asked for my phone number when I made the reservation.  One would think they could call and let me know they were running late, especially after promising we wouldn&#39;t have to wait by coming later.

After about 1 hour, we were finally seated.  It was freezing cold in the place and it felt like the air conditioner was blowing directly on us even though it was about 10 degrees outside.  Some people in my party were so cold they had to eat with their coats on the whole time. 

We ordered our meals and also ordered the hibachi noodles.  Come to find out, ordering the noodles (which cost extra) somehow replaces the fried rice that comes with the meal.  We asked for the rice we were supposed to get and it came toward the end of the meal from the kitchen.  The rice was good but they charged us about $9.00 for 3 servings for something that was supposed to be part of the meal. 

The food was good and so was the chef.  He did all the normal hibachi shenanigans and was entertaining. 

To top it all off, were where there celebrating a birthday.  Apparently for birthdays they come and bang some drum and sing, along with bringing a piece of cake or something.  It&#39;s more embarrassing than anything but I wanted to get payback on someone who let Chili&#39;s know it was my birthday and embarrassed me.  I let the hostess know about the birthday and I also let the waitress know.  By the end of the meal, the place was pretty empty with only 2 or 3 other tables remaining.  I stalled as long as I could but they never came with the birthday routine.  We just ended up leaving. 

If it wasn&#39;t for the food, the whole experience would have been a bust.  With so many other Japanese places around, I won&#39;t be back to  this one."

At least once every few weeks. There food is the best around. They always have Groupon deals which is awesome! But it seems ever since they started the Groupon deals they have become to popular and haven&#39;t hired any more staff. Every time we go the wait, unless you made a reservation, is long especially on Friday or Saturday night which is to be expected, but you just can tell there is NO organization. The woman who is the owner or the manager is always running around like a crazy person trying to help the people at the front desk but you can tell she is making it worse. You have to wait a really long time to get a refill, the waitress usually has a ton of tables and you never know where they disappear to. They aren&#39;t any where to be found and then they appear from the kitchen area looking frantic. I don&#39;t know if they have them helping in back as well as waiting tables but the service has gone noticeably down hill a lot since we first started going there. We use to joke that the waiters would hover, as soon as you took the last bite of something they were right there to pick up the empty plate. Now you have to hunt someone down or grab a random worker running past you to get a refill or to take the tower of plates from you. The food is outstanding but give yourself a long time for your meal unless you go at an off time. I highly recommend the godzilla, the dragon and the volcano rolls. All of them are my favorites. I would love to give them a 5 but the service is just terrible."

The only reason I got my seaweed salad because I had to ask why I haven&#39;t received it. Mind it the group halfway thru their meal when I finally received my salad. I ordered temaki rolls and about 40 mins later after everyone received their meal I finally got my rolls but their gave me maki instead. At this point I lost my appetite waiting and cancelled the remake and left my party. Again it wasn&#39;t that busy to have slow or inadequate service.

The atmosphere just throws me off, but the food is a pleasant surprise.  

We ordered a shrimp tempura roll as an appetizer and it was good, but by far one of the top rolls we have had.  You can tell the ingredients are fresh which is a plus. 

We decided we would do the hitachi for entrees. My husband ordered the seafoood explosion which he loved.  He chose lobster, calamari and shrimp. I ordered the small filet and it was extremely tender and flavorful. 

Our grill artist (is that what they are called?) was nice.  He wasnt overly entertaining, but we really dont go out for dinner to be entertained.  The next table over had a hillairous chef who was squirting sake down everyones throat.  We passed.  It was a Tuesday for heavens sake!

I&#39;ve been here several times with girlfriends and my fiance, and we haven&#39;t been disappointed once.  We haven&#39;t tried the hibachi, because the sushi is just too irresistible.

What to do:

-Try a watermelon lychee martini.  It&#39;s the best drink on the menu, and I&#39;ve never had anything like it.
-Try the Pink Lady sushi roll.  I love the crunch on the outside, and it isn&#39;t overloaded with sauce.
-Try MORE rolls!  If you&#39;re adventurous, try the mango madness.  It has a nice zesty fruit flavor, and the mango sauce isn&#39;t too heavy.  Another favorite is the shrimp &amp; crunchy.

What not to do:
-Expect quick service, especially on a weekend.
-Try the Chicago roll.  Avoid!  Not good.  Too much sauce.
-Order a California roll and pay for it - you can use your coupon for this!

PROS:
-You get a coupon for a free appetizer or roll on your next visit, every time!
-Extensive menu with fresh sushi
-No long waits to be seated
-Inexpensive, compared to other sushi places

CONS:
-Can get loud near the hibachi tables (ask to be seated in the dining area if you want quiet
-Somewhat long waits for your order
-Some of the waitstaff does not speak good English and can sometimes mess up your order (happened only once, we ordered the shrimp &amp; crunchy roll.  It wasn&#39;t crunchy, I don&#39;t know what it was.  Looked like crab).

Its really calm here and a good spot for a quiet evening but don&#39;t come hungry like I did, I got pretty aggravated after waiting 15 minutes for our server to come and another 10 to get a drink... not to mention the food. Overall it was entertaining and flavorful. I&#39;m giving 3 stars because I&#39;m annoyed at the fact that I had to wait so long on a slow night for service and there was no one around when I needed another drink. I might, might not return.

The main one being shopping (at Maurice&#39;s)...Don&#39;t judge me! I have often found myself out here famished with the usual Chili&#39;s and fast food joints around. Ugh! This is a great alternative when you find yourself out in the boonies, as I refer to the area. 

I absolutely refused to do the hibachi! C&#39;mon, I have to fit in shorts in a matter of days! All of the sushi was pretty good. I stuck to basic maki rolls and a few pieces of tuna sashimi. 

The service was around the 3 star range, but was pretty attentive during my dessert (red bean ice cream). Yum! 

Prices are very reasonable, and they even give you a coupon for a free item on your next visit! Now I can grab some lunch and not have to go up a size at Maurice&#39;s.

The sushi rolls are innovative and the sashimi is very fresh.  Be sure to get some drinks and try the fried banana + ice cream for desert.

Once it wrapped up at almost 9pm we quickly searched Yelp for a place that was both open for dinner and nearby.  We saw a listing for Heaven on Seven and said &#34;good enough.&#34;  But as it turns out it was even better than good enough.  

We walked in and were surprised to find a live jazz band playing, as well as a highly thematic interior design celebrating all things New Orleans.  The place was fairly hopping with a late Friday crowd but we were still seated quickly at a rather large table at the back.

My sister and I split the &#34;angry mussels,&#34; which were excellent.  They were just the right amount of spicy and the sauce was pleasantly chunky with onions and tomatoes.  We were still talking about those mussels the next day, they were so good.  This item was on the specials menu, FYI, so sadly it might not be there if you stop by another time.  Also, it should be noted that our waitress brought this dish to our table already split into two plates - great service!

We also shared the sweet potato &#34;polenta,&#34; which was more like a sweet potato pudding - dessert-like, and reminiscent of caramel.  It made for a nice dessert and so we saved it for last, but it is sort of a strange side dish.  

Others in our group ordered the gumbo, which was very tasty, with a nice smoky flavor.  I see why all of the staff t-shirts advertise it.

The only criticisms, which are not enough to deduct a star in my opinion, are: the bread at the table was decidedly not warm at all, which was a minor disappointment.  Likewise, it seemed like some of the dishes were not quite as warm as I expected.  They were definitely above room temperature, but seemed to run a bit cool.  The flavor was not affected though, so again not something I would really worry about.  This was our first time here, so that might have been a one-time event in any case.

In conclusion, this place was a really lucky find and a nice way to cap off our evening.  We are eager to return again and try some of the other very tempting items on the menu."

When I first stepped foot into Heaven on Seven, I noticed the shelves on one side of the restaurant that are filled with bottles of hot sauce. My bf and I both enjoy Cajun good and were excited to try this place. I ordered the fried oyster po-boy and my bf ordered the voodoo chicken pasta. The waitress warned him that the pasta is very spicy. My bf still agreed to the challenge lol!

We both had gumbo before our entrees. The gumbo was flavorful! I wished I would have done the bowl instead of the cup size. 

Our entrees were generous portions. When my bf took one bite of his pasta, he was surprised by how spicy it was! I took a bite and felt the intensity of the peppers. The pasta was tasty but it was good that the server provided a warning earlier.

The po-boy was filled with lettuce, tomato and plump fried oysters. It was challenging to keep all of the fixings in the sandwich! The entree came with a side of sweet mayo and coleslaw. Can&#39;t go wrong with a po-boy in a New Orleans-themed restaurant! 

Overall, an excellent experience!!"

So the busboy drops of the bread as we sit. The basket had two slices of bread a half eaten cup of butter. We waited for our waiter Ryan to come over and informed him about the bread. He said that it is not possible and that they do not serve stale bread. 

I told him that we are only informing him so that he can tell the busboy about it. So we asked for some more bread. &#34;So the stale bread was so good now you want more&#34; was his comment. I kept my cool but started my Yelp comment as I was waiting for my food. Ryan must have looked over my shoulder and discovered what I was doing. So he comes over and says &#34;BTW my name is Ryan if you want to add it to the review.&#34; 

All these many years at Jimmy&#39;s place and I have never had even a hint of bad service. I am sure the food was great. Did not wait for it. I hope that Ryan has a better day tomorrow than today. Maybe he needs to find a new profession hopefully not in the hospitality business."
heaven-on-seven-naperville,Eric S.,rkdE06BbheP4gEhb3ooH0w,"Oak Park, IL",1,1,1,661,143,wF_2qyWbara3f5VMvHwBUA,5.0,2016-03-10,"Coming to Heaven on &#39;7&#39;--at which I &#39;8&#39;--put me directly on Cajun cloud &#39;9&#39;.

I vaguely remember eating here a few summers back (Yelp says it was around 7/4/14), but as I recall the experience was good enough to warrant a return, and I was right!  I&#39;ve found the food here to be better than Shanahan&#39;s in Forest Park, and although the atmosphere isn&#39;t quite as lively as it is at Pappadeaux in Westmont, the excellent service more than makes up for it.

On a gorgeous weeknight in early March, I met my dinner companion here for some good ole&#39; Creole.  I was early to arrive so I ordered the house specialty drink--a hurricane--and looked over the menu.  To my amazement, I wasn&#39;t carded for the strong cocktail (which came with a lovely adornment of beads).  Eventually my date arrived and we put in an order for noms.

Once again, I started with their &#39;hot as a mutha&#39; appetizer, which is a habanero pepper filled with Chihuahua cheese, breaded &amp; deep-fried, then served atop a tropical salsa medley that included mango and green bell peppers.  For connoisseurs of spicy things, it&#39;s a great little firecracker of an item, largely due to the fact that the kitchen doesn&#39;t remove the seeds or the veins prior to preparation.  For $6, I&#39;d happily do it again.

There&#39;s so much to choose from on their menu, but I ultimately decided on the Mardi Gras platter, which essentially gave me a little bit of everything.  It came with: BBQ ribs, jerk chicken wings, shrimp &amp; andouille sausage eggrolls, crab cakes, jalapeno corn blasters, and cajun chicken bites.  I also got a cup of gumbo with it, which was a pleasant surprise.  After sampling a bit of everything, I came to the conclusion that everything was at least &#39;good&#39; (a few things were &#39;great&#39;) and nothing sucked.

The huge wall of hot sauces is a sight to behold, but they&#39;re strictly decorative, so don&#39;t touch  [even if you&#39;re tempted {as I was}, they&#39;re glued down/cemented to the shelf, so those bottles ain&#39;t goin anywhere].  Green, yellow, and purple streamer-like things fluttered on the ceiling, and New Orleans-themed art hung on the wall opposite the hot sauces.  This place has a great vibe to it; it&#39;s really hard not to love.

Ironically, the last time I was here on 7/4/14, I had the exact same server (Steve, the bald guy) who once again did a terrific job.  He was the perfect balance of engaging and genuine that took a 4.5-star meal into 5-star territory.

Bread = 4.5
Circuses = 5!

I&#39;ve had a couple terrific experiences at NaperThrill&#39;s Heaven on Seven, so I think it&#39;s time to give the original downtown location a shot.  I gotta imagine the food and atmo is as enjoyable there as it is here (at least, I hope)."

Like, I seriously LOOOVE jambalaya.  It&#39;s one of my ultimate comfort foods, and one of the handful of things on this planet that helps keep me from going bonkers.  I hunt down jambalaya, and I&#39;ve had a lot over the years - good, bad, and everything else in between.  I think the jambalaya at Heaven on Seven, in Naperville, is my fav-o-rite!  It was better than the one at the Wabash location, better than anything I&#39;ve made, and better than anything else I&#39;ve gotten at other restaurants.  

Geez, I can&#39;t even clearly remember anything else I got, despite being stone-cold sober.  I remember telling my pals that the gumbo was really good, and I made a mental note in my head about the etouffee also being really good... But it&#39;s all just overshadowed by how body-slamming awesome the jambalaya was.  If I could feel complex human emotions, I probably would have wept while eating this.  The service was also great, and the meal was even better because of the fun atmosphere.  I&#39;ll be back for more, oh yes I will!"

But the lack of attention to details speaks to poor management and no excuse for the other food they microwave out to customers. Both the Cajun Surf and Turf and Coconut Shrimp were cold to lukewarm when served. The steak was ordered medium and came out well done.
When notified about the cold Coconut Shrimp the brought out a new order, but had nuked the coconut sauce with the rice, to a baby food puree consistency. Amazing how that could be overlooked on a meal on a first refusal!
Perhaps another location would be worth trying. Love Cajun food. But not from here.
Our server was helpful and pleasant. Gave a nice tip regardless, not the waitress&#39;s fault."

I was a bit hungry so I kinda went all out on the Creole experience and went with the gumbo, side of jambalaya and the Angry Chicken poboy. And when they say angry...it&#39;s pretty angry. Not recommended if you don&#39;t want any stomach complications. But the gumbo and the jamalaya definitely hit the spot.

You can taste a lot of southern flavors coming out of the gumbo and jambalaya.

And I still wasn&#39;t done. I went for the banana ice cream cake. Ok, maybe I went overboard, but that was a great way to finish the meal.

Great place, great beer selection. Love their collection of hot sauces on the wall. Servers were pretty cool too."

They were able to seat us right away, and close to the live band which was nice to hear but sorta loud. The whole place was loud. 

Our server was super friendly, even offered to have us split our entree when we said we wanted the same thing. This was an excellent choicw because we didn&#39;t even finish between the both of us. We had the wings for an appetizer and they were so good but incredibly spicy. So if youre sensitive, beware. The drinks were as expected, nothing to knock your socks off but good.

My husband and I have stopped in a while ago just to grab a drink at the bar (because they had Zombie Dust on tap!), but we finally came in to eat dinner just last weekend. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s that we built up Heaven on Seven in our heads this whole time, or that we just had too high of expectations, or if we assumed we&#39;d love it because my parents do. Whatever it was, it was not the experience I had hoped for.

We walked in on a Saturday evening at about 6:30 pm and had to wait for a table. This was no big deal though - we just grabbed a couple spots up at the bar. They have a really great beer and cocktail list. I got the St. Germaine cocktail which was pretty and delicious. I appreciate that the bartender gave me a baby sized carafe of the extra champagne! Hubby got Woodford Reserve on the rocks (typical).

Once we were sat, our server explained the specials and brought complimentary pickles and bread for the table. We thought this was interesting but as always, were down to try anything. The pickles were seasoned with some sort of glaze. I like it, but not sure my husband did. The bread was a bit dry and hard for my liking, but I think the butter had honey in it because that was really good.

We started with a suggested app from our server - their shrimp and andouille egg rolls which come with spicy mustard, ginger mango sauce and Asian slaw. I really enjoyed these egg rolls, but again, my husband not so much. It was a little unfortunate that our waiter did not warn us how spicy these would be! I mean sure, I read spicy mustard on the menu, but I did not see anything about jalapeno peppers! Luckily I like spicy, but some bites were just not even worth the heat. Although this app comes with 4 large egg rolls, I still thought $12.99 was a bit too much to pay for it.

For my entree I knew I wanted something with shrimp, so I scoured their like 10 different options. I was toying between two different things, so I really appreciated it when our server brought out the two different sauces for me to try. I actually liked them both, so he ended up suggesting the shrimp creole over rice with a sweet &amp; tangy tomato sauce. You can get the shrimp dishes in 3 different sizes - appetizer (4 shrimp), entree (6), or Jimmy size (10). I went with the entree which I thought was a good sized portion. Again, I thought $20.99 was a bit steep for 6 shrimp, rice, and sauce, but it was very tasty. My husband got the salmon and crab cake special and was unimpressed. That&#39;s actually the first time I&#39;ve seen him not even want to take home leftovers. Both entrees came with soup or salad and we both selected soup. My husband got the gumbo and I went with their shrimp and corn soup. I honestly did not care for it - way too sweet.

My overall feeling is that we will be back for drinks or a light bite, but I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be dropping such a hefty bill here anytime soon. Just not worth it."

Enters Heaven on Seven. I am obsessed with gumbo, but I never go to places that serve it. It was weekend brunch time, and I was determined to get some delicious gumbo from anywhere I could.
  As soon as I sat down (which was pretty much right as they opened), I asked if the gumbo was ready. It was. I ordered that and their tasty take on Eggs Benedict. My other half ordered a country fried steak dish. Both dishes came with a buttload of pancakes-our server was so nice and opted to count my gumbo as my side so we wouldn&#39;t have to eat our way through 20 pounds of pancake. 
  Service was quick and portions were great. Everything was very filling. Prices are a bit high for suburban brunch, but if this is the type of cuisine you are craving and you are stuck in the suburbs, this is not a bad option."

We were at Heaven for my sister&#39;s 30th birthday. We were 6 adults and with so many yummy appetizers we decided to try a lot of them. 
- Spicy Mussels (delicious)
- Polenta and Andouille ssusage (delicious)
- fried oysters (amazing) 
- calamari (it was good, but i&#39;ve had better)
- crab cakes (Good.)

Most of us ordered entrees that included a soup or salad. I got the beef tips with a salad and their house dressing was soooooo delicious. I think the beef tips were just OK. Nothing out of this world. A couple people in our party got the Mahi Mahi special and said it was the best they&#39;ve ever had. 

We all go to try the mud pie dessert because we were celebrating a birthday and the pie was one of the best things I&#39;ve tasted.

I would definitely go back, but this time I would probably order more of their creative/traditional appetizers and maybe skip on the main course. It&#39;s definitely a cool spot, and who doesn&#39;t LOVE downtown Naperville?!"

My wife and I have loved Heaven on Seven for years. The food has been consistently good and I love spicy (Shrimp Voodoo and chicken bites with crystal butter sauce was particularly good).

Unfortunately over the last year the quality of everything (at this location at least) has really gone down hill. While waiting for our friends, in a very un-busy restaurant, the bartender repeatedly forgot to bring our drinks. When we finally sat down, a small plate of semi-burnt corn bread was presented. More waiting. The server, while nice, was no where to be seen for the most part. We ordered the chicken bites, which were flavorless and the dipping sauce was similarly unremarkable with a light film over the top making me think it was quickly microwaved. More waiting - still no server to take our order. We finally gave up, paid for the drinks and bites and went an had a great meal at Crosstown Pub.  They lost a lot of money.

There really is no quality control on every level as far as I could tell. It really bums me out because I do miss the old days where I was always excited to go. It should be noted, that for how expensive it actually is, I expect much much more."

Chose this restaurant to celebrate my husband&#39;s birthday and the service was completely awful. We explained to the waitress multiple times we couldn&#39;t eat pork and we asked her for suggestions. 
When we asked for suggestions she asked if we were in the mood for pork. Then she apologized and went to suggest meals that had pork in them. Finally, we came to decision and we made sure to tell her no pork but extra chicken. After waiting for our plates, it comes with pork. We had birthday plans so we couldn&#39;t wait for another dish to come out so me and my husband ate out of my dish in silence for the rest of the night because we were so upset. And if that wasnt enough, she messed up the check and tried today charge us for the extra chicken we never got. Paid $50 for the worst meal and service I have ever gotten.

1.The place makes some good  food! jambalya, gumbo, and po boys are my favorite
2.The service is very good with good waiters and waitresses
3.The atmosphere is great
4. Great hot sauces!

1.Holy cow the voodoo sauce is so hot! I was warned and did not listen.  I took the waiter for his word when he said it would have some flavor and not just be pure heat. Nope. It was pure heat!  I&#39;m from Texas and can handle a little bit of heat and I like voodoo sauce normally. Two people at the table took a few bites and that was all they could handle. I&#39;m not saying it is inedible, just don&#39;t be fooled. This stuff is really spicy and you are gonna have to sweat and push hard to finish it. Treat it like a food challenge and you will be just fine. Just remember what goes in your mouth must.....(you have been warned) 
2. Hard to find a seat here. I have had to wait for over 30 minutes every time
3. The food and cocktails are a little overpriced in my opinion

BEWARE THE VOODOO!"

I think it&#39;s pretty darn tasty and it&#39;s nice to have something in Naperville that&#39;s not a giant chain behemoth.  

The service is decent, they have a good beer list, and the portion sizes are very generous.  I took my parents here when they visited me in Naperville for the first time because I was wracking my brain for something they would like (they&#39;re not really into burgers) that wasn&#39;t too expensive or a chain that also took reservations.  I will probably go back at some point, but I am not rushing there every day.  

I like the ambiance a lot.  I think that the wall of hot sauces they have is really fun to look at and can spark some amusing conversation.  I don&#39;t think the restaurant its self is very comfortable, which maybe contributes to my lack of enthusiasm about returning.  The chairs are very uncomfortable and the tables are squished together.

We stopped in for brunch once and they had live music, which was a nice touch.  I&#39;ve also gotten take out from here, which is an excellent option."

It really bothered me, but my husband didn&#39;t notice anything. I will say the food was decent-okay. 3/5. But the service was 4/5. Not too bad, but nothing that wowed me. Food was pretty good actually.

Appetizers: bayou Jalepeno blastera. Deep fried corn bread with pockets of cheese and sweetness. Really good dipping sauce. Definitely recommend 

Gratis bread: nothing special. Cold, clearly not house made, it had a slight rubbery bite indicative of it not being fresh, and at least out for the last 8 hours. Served with a honey butter. That butter was definitely delicious. 

Entree: I got the coconut shrimp with mango-papaya paint (yes paint). Presentation was good. There was a red curry sauce that came with my dish that they put in a half coconut shell. The mango-papaya sauce (paint) was an utter dissappointment. It basically was a Alphonso mango pur√©e from a can from a local Hispanic or Indian grocery store. (While I&#39;m an absolute fan of canned Alphonso mango pur√©e, I don&#39;t expect it in a dish if I&#39;m eating out!). The red curry sauce had a very strange aftertaste, as if there was some form of  a strong preservative in it. The coconut shrimp itself was excellent though. 

Other entree: chicken enchiladas. This was good, my husband got this one. Definitely recommend. 

Skipped dessert as we were not impressed overall. 

TL;DR: very annoying smell. Skip this place, try another place that takes Cajun a bit more seriously and uses quality ingredients (i.e. fresh mango, and not mango puree out of a can) to hit that authentic flavor."

We placed a togo order for the crab cakes, fried chicken po&#39; boy with fries, fried green tomatoes and a jalape√±o corn muffin. 

Crab cakes were cold, but probably the best tasting thing in our order. 

The fried chicken po&#39; boy was very disappointing. To start, the chicken was dry, there was no remoulade or any kind of sauce on the sandwich or on the side and they forgot the fries all together. 

We are big fans of fried green tomatoes but these were just awful and also, cold. 

The jalape√±o corn muffin was without question, a day or two old and hard as a rock. Didn&#39;t even take a bite. 

I want to add that we picked up our order 20 minutes after placing it so under no circumstances should any of the food have been cold or even room temp. 

For prices as high as Heaven on Seven&#39;s, there is no excuse for anything to be less than par. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!"

I had heard sooooo much about this place over the years, and even worked just a few blocks away from it, but had just never been. The first time that I went was a social invite with a group of friends. Such a fun place for meeting up with a group! I&#39;ve been back a few times since, generally always to meet up with friends or to take folks who are visiting from out of town.

Though they have a unique cuisine and a pretty hefty menu, my favorite thing about the restaurant is the location. Being in the heart of downtown Naperville it is always a good time, and the restaurant itself has a great ambiance and wonderful feel to it. I see many other reviewers mention the wait, though I have not personally had that problem. But, the times that I&#39;ve been there it has always been in the afternoon, so that is probably why. 

If you love cajun food or even if you&#39;re just curious about it and want to try it out (as I was), this is a great place to expand your horizons. I love spicy food but had never tried anything even remotely cajun before I went here. I like trying new things though and so chose the gumbo and jambalaya. Both were quite good, very meaty and hearty. Since, I&#39;ve also tried the chicken pot pie and turtle soup. I&#39;d say my favorite dish is the pot pie, which isn&#39;t in pie form but is very rich and creamy, with a wonderful flavor. They do give you a lot of food (and it is probably not the healthiest place ever) but it is definitely enjoyable. 

The times that I&#39;ve gone the service has been pretty average. I&#39;ve yet to find that &#34;amazing&#34; wait staff experience, but they keep the drinks going and don&#39;t leave you waiting too long to place your order. Nothing spectacular but no complaints either. 

If you&#39;re looking for a place to take friends for a great experience, with decent food, this is a fantastic pick. The food doesn&#39;t blow me out of the water, but it is always a good time and the prices are fair for what you get."

I have always lumped Michigan Ave restaurants in the same category as restaurants around Time Square. --no one in their right mind should ever consider eating at any restaurant around there. --TGIF anybody? Gross.  Actually, just avoid Time Square altogether.  

But, one chilly late Autumn night, my hubs and I were doing some Christmas shopping in downtown Naper and he suggested we thaw out with some spicy food. Actually, he is a burning furnace, so I was the one in need of thawing. We both have a healthy love of heat and Heaven had immediate seating; so, after years of never giving this restaurant a glance, I found myself sitting in their Naper location.

Tables are packed in. You especially feel this when you&#39;re sharing your space with the vast majority of women with their big coats and big bags. 

I love the gumbo. It&#39;s really thick, but that&#39;s how I like it. Has layers of deep flavors. It has nice heat, but mostly in the sausage. --The rice helps balance everything. 

The bread basket = Awful. Stale and tasteless. I should volunteer my services and help them out.  ;) 

Voodoo Chicken. Never again. I know it&#39;s a classic here, but it was SWIMMING in cheese. So much cheese I was gagging. If I&#39;d ordered that the first time, I probably wouldn&#39;t have ever gone back. 

Sweet Potato Palenta... just sit the serving bowl in front of me and hand me a serving spoon. I don&#39;t need to eat anything else. In fact, it&#39;s all for me; buy your own. 

It&#39;s a step above Chilis for sure, but not a place I can be talked into more than once a year. I might consider eating here a little more often *if they managed to put at least ONE marginally healthy entree on the menu."

The wife had shrimp and cheese grits with a cup of gumbo.  Her cup of gumbo had one slice of sausage.  Her shrimp and cheese grits was delicious.  It had very nice cheese flavor, ham added was good, and shitake mushrooms a nice touch.  The portion of the shrimp was good.

The first thing that grabs your attention when you walk in is the colorful atmosphere and fun vibe of the decorations and vast wall of hot sauces which is an excellent conversation piece. 

The first thing you get when you sit down is a small bowl of pickled peppers (banana I believe) and pickles as well as bread with sweet butter. The menu is filled with tons mouth watering options but is not overwhelming. Dining with a friend, we decided to split the fried green tomatoes with gulf shrimp and Louisiana crab cakes with a remoulade sauce appetizer. It was nothing short of satisfying. The portions are hearty are great for sharing. The crab cakes were light and flavorful and came with a generous amount of sauce to compliment the cakes. The fried tomatoes were cooked to perfection without an overload of breading. The shrimp were so juicy and tender that we decided we needed to order more shrimp dishes as our main course. 

We decided on the buffalo shrimp over rice &amp; coconut shrimp with rice &amp; dipping sauce. They were both phenomenal. The sauces were immensely flavorful. Tasting &amp; adding a few of their many hot sauces on the table to our dishes kicked them up a notch further than they already were. 

While we planned on dessert, there was simply no room in our stomachs afterwards. However, the drink special of the day (the hurricane) was a perfect pairing to our meal. You get a surprisingly large glass for only 7$.

Oh Naperville, you&#39;ve given me another reason to consider moving to this beautiful town of yours. Heaven on Seven is a hidden treasure chest, not much to look at on the outside, but we all know the inside is really where it&#39;s at. A huge menu of various cajun/Creole food specialties and fun wall decors of various types of hot sauces.

We came on a Thursday evening and it wasn&#39;t super packed, but still busy. We were greeted and drink orders were taken. The sweet tea is quite delicious (not too sweet) and free re-fills! Our party of 4 ordered: fried green tomatoes with crabmeat, a bowl of gumbo, 3lb crawfish boil special, shrimp and grits and &#34;appetizer size&#34; coconut shrimp.

Fried green tomatoes with crabmeat (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/heaven-on-seven-naperville?select=AjSYOeIJZzomvAEhZNJd7A#AjSYOeIJZzomvAEhZNJd7A) - at first I was skeptical ordering this, but like they said anything fried has to be good and boy was this one of the highlights of our meal. The crabmeat complimented the fried green tomatoes very well and the breading of the green tomatoes was light.

Bowl of gumbo (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/heaven-on-seven-naperville?select=AjSYOeIJZzomvAEhZNJd7A#JIuo7M0SSMLvtP7sMyxWGQ) - left a lot to be desired. This was highly recommended so we decided to go for the bowl, which we didn&#39;t finish. It was kind of lukewarm and just left us wanting something more. Maybe more of a kick or seasoning.

3lbs crawfish broil (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/heaven-on-seven-naperville?select=AjSYOeIJZzomvAEhZNJd7A#_Jr069vr3MmL-9OyDKEicw) - our first thought when this came was &#34;is this really 3lbs?&#34; The crawfish was meh, some of it was way too salty and not enough spice and juiciness.

Coconut shrimp (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/heaven-on-seven-naperville?select=AjSYOeIJZzomvAEhZNJd7A#srnry0Dw5ru70V9lMFapPQ) - I love that the curry sauce came in a coconut shell, how clever, unfortunately the curry sauce didn&#39;t taste like anything and it was bland, but the coconut shrimps themselves were big and delicious. The rice mixture was a combination of rice and potatoes that compliment the shrimps very well.

Shrimps and grits (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/heaven-on-seven-naperville?select=AjSYOeIJZzomvAEhZNJd7A#Ts6OWuNfCIUr2V0ScyrE9A) - BEST. SHRIMP. AND. GRITS. I&#39;VE. EVER. HAD. This was by far the best dish of the night (okay, so maybe the fried green tomatoes were up there too). This dish is definitely not skimpy of shrimp, it almost felt like AYCE. The grits were perfect texture and had just enough Parmesan-reggiano. The tasso ham, shiitake mushrooms and green onions enhance the dish by ten folds. I&#39;m seriously drooling just thinking about this dish and recommends everyone to try it because before you know it you&#39;ll be licking the plate clean. 

A little miss-hap is the server forgot to bring our our jalapeno cheddar corn muffin that I was really looking forward to trying, but honestly forgot about it since I was falling in love with the shrimp and grits (the reason why this place is getting a 4 star even though I rate it 3.5). She did apologize and ask if we wanted to take it to go, but what would we cherish it with? There was no more grits or gumbo to eat it with. Oh well, just another reason for us to come back and try their other dishes."

On a recent Sunday we arrived and immediately discovered they were out of catfish, disappointing but not a deal killer.  They brought a bread basket to the table that I think was Torano&#39;s wheat bread, although decent it was totally out of place when some corn muffins, or biscuits would have been more appropriate.  There was butter in the basket sweetened with something that didn&#39;t go with the bread, and the other spread was a red bean paste...ugh!  I ordered a Sazerac, and my dining companion ordered a Margarita.  Drinks were ok.  We started with fried green tomatoes with a spicey remoulade sauce topped with shrimp.  The tomatoes were cut way too thick and ended up tasting raw and crunchy, and badly needed salt.  We didn&#39;t even finish them.  We both ordered oyster po&#39; boys, which ended up being open faced sandwiches on French bread.  Again the oysters lacked salt, the sandwich was so so.  I got a side of gumbo that was thick brown goo with a couple of paper thin slices of what may have been andouille...not sure but it had a few shreds of stringy chicken.  I was glad I didn&#39;t order a bowl.  Perhaps this is a place for brunch, I don&#39;t know.  All I know is the fried green tomatoes, oyster po boy and gumbo sucks! Service was good, noise level is high and ambience is colorful."

We almost left because there was no one up front and it was hard to tell they were open. That is the ONLY thing that I can say that isn&#39;t a raving recommendation. Their menu is expansive and true to Cajun New Orleans feast. There isn&#39;t many descriptions, however, as it is difficult to order if na√Øve to creole cuisine. I ordered the Crab Cakes and Cajun tater tots- the cakes were incredible, the tots were simply generic frozen to fry with some seasoning on top, honestly a let down when ordered in comparison to rest of menu.  My friend ordered the Coconut Shrimp; which came with a sweet curry sauce in a half pineapple atop a white rice with tri colored peppers and a dash of sauce which was aesthetically beautiful.  The gumbo was perfect with large pieces of sausage and comes with meal. Our server was quick and courteous. Will definitely return."

I want to say there&#39;s 200+ bottles of various hot sauces.  So obviously they are about spicy food.  But don&#39;t worry, not everything on their menu is spicy.  They just have an impressive selection of hot sauces. 

 When you&#39;re seated, the first thing you notice are the collection of hot sauces on the table. You have your standard Cholula and Tabasco to really interesting ones like Aspirin and Ass in Space.  Haha they get funny and can be intimidating.  While my family and I waited for our food, we dropped several of these on a plate and began testing them.  Not bad. But if you have stomach ulcers or suffer from heart burn, take your Prilosec now!!! 

Their rice and beans with andouille sausage is good.  Has a mild kick to it.  I ordered their deep fried catfish.  Mannn, their portions are big!! They brought out a huge filet of breaded catfish, that probably would serve 2 people.  That was a good dish. I highly recommend their breaded catfish.
Overall, good restaurant.  Not for those who aren&#39;t into spicy foods."

I remembered that there&#39;s a Heaven On Seven out there -- Heaven On Seven was always her favorite restaurant in Chicago (and one of mine) but we&#39;ve really been missing the old Rush Street location...and we saw that the menu at the Naperville location is virtually identical to that of the now-closed Rush/Ohio location.

We ordered our old favorites. There are a few subtle differences, but it was still the Heaven On Seven we&#39;ve always loved.

I have no idea why there is a sudden rash of bad reviews recently. From our experience, everything was top notch. The food (kind of a hybrid of the various flavors Jimmy Banos gathered from his travels to New Orleans and a hint of Italian cuisine influenced by his Italian mother) is exactly what I expected (although if the Rush Street location was any indications the po&#39; boys were not New Orleans quality), very delicious, very filling. Glad to see the bread and honey butter from Rush was here, along with a savory spread that I don&#39;t remember seeing at the other Heaven locations.

Service: absolutely wonderful. Shannon was an excellent server and very patiently dealt with my wife and me as we were blindly ordering as if it were the old Rush Street location (again, there were subtle differences we weren&#39;t ready for), and the kitchen accommodated my wife&#39;s special request of etouff√© as a side item.

Only explanation I can think of for the people giving Heaven On Seven bad ratings are that Napervillains are so suburban...they probably think that if you want a good burger you go to freakin&#39; Culver&#39;s (yuck!) or that Olive Garden is quality Italian cuisine....and they&#39;re not used to real food that&#39;s not loaded with preservatives.

Hey, suburbanites...this is what REAL food tastes like. Great flavor without the extra salty crap of your suburban sprawl places.

My only complaint -- and not big enough to dock a star off my review -- is that the bathroom doesn&#39;t have a map of New Orleans painted on the wall like the now-defunct Rush Street location had....but a nice compromise is the beautiful artwork on the wall for sale, proceeds going to help those still suffering from Katrina.

Oh...and take my advice: get the gumbo. You&#39;re welcome."

My wife did not like her fried green tomatoes with crab one bit. According to her, crab should not smell that bad. Might have even been old. Me, I had the southern chicken fried chicken breast, and that wasn&#39;t very good either. The sauce they put on top really ruined it. It didn&#39;t help that on the way home, the doggie bag made the car smell like old shoes, prompting us to throw it away.

The only saving grace was the gumbo, which was fantastic, but still, two stars is what this place gets."

We recently moved to Naperville and decided to try out Heaven on Seven as our first downtown restaurant.  Made a 9 pm reservation online and were seated immediately.  The kids loved their crayons and worksheets, and their kid menu was priced nicely at $6 with entree, fries or tator tots, drink, and ice cream.  However, the adult food really didn&#39;t meet my expectation.  I ordered the shrimp ragatote linguini as I was craving a spicy Cajun cream based shrimp linguini like the kind I have eaten and enjoyed in NOLA, but this was not the case here.  Our server did say that the dish was not spicy, but he didn&#39;t mention that it would lack taste completely.  The sauce was thin and bland and had no hint of cream whatsoever.  We also ordered the Bayou jalape√±o corn blasters, which were sweet and not spicy at all.  I was hoping for a jalape√±o popper-esque dish, but was disappointed.  They didn&#39;t have any frozen non-alcoholic beverages, and I was told they don&#39;t own a blender at all .  We skipped dessert, including the kids&#39; ice creams, and just walked to Coldstone Ice Cream down the street.  The only saving grace was that my husband liked the ambience inside--said it reminded him of NOLA (one of our favorite cities), and said his shrimp po boy was pretty decent; however, I don&#39;t see myself coming back again."

I approached the reception podium when a slovenly young lady slowly approached. I told her I was here to pick up and order for the Laine party, she asked me to sign the receipt then walked away, and began serving drinks and food. She said nothing, so I went to the bar and told them I was here to pick up an order and how would the kitchen know if no one told them, the girl at at the bar stated that the slovenly young lady would tell them.  Ok....so when? So, I asked miss slovenly again, she said they are packing it up.
I continued to wait another 20 minutes with no word from the slovenly hostess, another young women came out with 3 to go orders, 2 others were waiting for carry out as well. Maybe if the young hostess had any level of communication skills this would not have been so frustrating.  The customer service at the front of the house, due to the employee is desperately lacking in simple decorum.  If the hostess is too lazy to get the orders as they are done, and customers are told a wait time that is erroneous! and when you finally get the order it is not even correct.
It was not busy....maybe that&#39;s a sign of the times here.  Horrible service!"

I L-O-V-E the decor. As a hot sauce fanatic, I enjoy browsing the Wall of Sauce. It reminds me of Pepper Palace in New Orleans with the amount of hot sauces they have displayed. 

My favorite dish has to be the Orzolaya; it&#39;s jambalaya, but with orzo instead. I don&#39;t like shrimp (it comes with it) so I always order without, and only one time did my order have shrimp on it (no biggie, I just picked &#39;em off. Not like I&#39;m allergic).

The Fried Green Tomatoes with the Warm Remoulade Sauce is fantastic! It&#39;s a large appetizer, perfectly filling for two people. 

The Mardi Gras Jambalaya has a nice spicy kick to it. 

Andouille Sausage Po&#39; Boy - spicy and filling! I like carmelized onions, but in moderation. They are generous with them, so tell &#39;em to go easy on the onions if you don&#39;t want them to overwhelm the sandwich.

The Muffaletta is absolutely devine. You can order it hot or cold, which is nice. I&#39;ve had it both ways and you can&#39;t go wrong with either. The olive salad is house made, the bread is soft, and the meats and cheeses were of great quality. I&#39;ve only seen it on the menu during Mardi Gras, so hurry in and try it.

The Chicken and Andouille Sausage Quesadilla is dynamite... the Cilantro Cream and Roasted Red Pepper Sauce are both so flavorful.

Louisiana Crab Cakes w/ Honey Jalapeno Dressing - you get two good sized crab cakes, served in a beautiful sea of their honey jalapeno dressing, with diced bell pepper garnish.

The Creole Omelette is awesome.  The sauce served over the top is mild but flavorful. 

Texas Chili Omelette w/cheddar cheese &amp; pico de gallo, comes with choice of toast and breakfast potatoes - The fiance has had this, and said it was probably the best thing ever. I&#39;ll take his word on that. He&#39;s also had the Chicken Voodoo Enchiladas and the Poached Eggs on Crab Cakes with Creole Sauce. 

Then there&#39;s the gumbo. I&#39;ve been to New Orleans twice, and let me tell you- HO7&#39;s is the best gumbo outside of NOLA. The best part? You can order a large quantity of it, and freeze it for later. Of course, later never comes because the other half and I will eat a gallon of it in two days. 

I&#39;m a huge Bloody Mary fan, and they have two different kinds; one with bacon, and a spicy one. The bacon one was just &#34;meh&#34;; I honestly couldn&#39;t taste any bacon flavoring. But the spicy one? WOW! If you like it hot, order one of them. Trust me.

Now, the cons:

Every flipping time I come and try to enjoy my meal, there&#39;s a family with loud, obnoxious children seated near us. I don&#39;t mind children in a restaurant, but PLEASE- if your child is banging their spoon on the table, for the love of god, take the spoon away. Or the infant that&#39;s screaming at the top of its lungs- I don&#39;t understand why the parents do not take the child outside so patrons are not disturbed.  I&#39;m spending a good chunk of change on my meal, and I&#39;d like to be able to enjoy my food and dining experience. 

The restaurant is small, and when it&#39;s crowded, your chair is pretty much touching the person&#39;s behind you (unless you&#39;re lucky enough to be against the wall). 

The waitstaff isn&#39;t the greatest. They&#39;d best be described at inattentive; you pretty much need to stand up and wave your arms to get their attention. It took 15 minutes for the waitress to refill my water. The second time, the buss boy got to it before the waitress did. 
They don&#39;t do a very good job at removing plates, cups, etc... anything you&#39;re done with, which is a pain because the tables are small enough to begin with.

Regardless of the few annoyances, I will continue to come to HO7, only because it&#39;s one of the best cajun restaurants in the area that I&#39;m familiar with."

Their environment was pretty interesting. They have someone singing live, and they have a whole wall of different sauces. It is cool to watch. Their hostess was very welcoming and friendly. 

Their menu is okay to me. They have a wide selection of food and drink, but they don&#39;t have much cuisines for crawfish or crabs. I saw the crawfish boil special on Yelp picture, but when I asked, I was informed that it is seasonal, and it ended in June. 

So I ended up getting their Cajun (sp?) styled fish covered crab cake. It looks really good, and it has a pretty generous portion. However, I wish it could be slightly more savory, and the crab cake was also slightly overcooked to me. 

It is a fun dinning experience. I want to come back to try their crawfish boil platter next year."

It was the perfect place to show them the suburban life, while offering some good food and drink.

To start, we shared an appetizer of fried green tomatoes with shrimp. It was awkward, as the plating is of three tomatoes and shrimp, within a pool of sauce that is more paste-like. The tomatoes were breaded a bit heavily for my taste, but it was warm and comforting, as I desired. 

I drank on a mango margarita in the desire that it would make me feel as if I were on a beach, and it did, so much that I could almost feel the sand betwixt my toes. (I&#39;ve been searching for a chance to use the word &#39;betwixt&#39;). 

For entrees, I had the blackened catfish with fried plantains. Not sure if it was meant to be a spicy dish, but it wasn&#39;t. At all. I found myself reaching for hot sauce again and again. So far, the beach I was taking myself to was one without spice. My friend had a fish dish that he did not find spicy as well. We found ourselves asking where the heat was, as I was thinking my issue was going to be that things were too spicy, not lacking heat. 

There was a yelp reward for checking in that granted you a free dessert, and sadly, I did not use it as I was aching for something sweet. 

The ambiance was trendy, with paintings for sale, the wall of hot sauce and music blasting. Not sure if I&#39;d take a date here as it was a little loud, but definitely good for a night with the girls or before a night out. Great proximity to downtown Naperville, and if there is no open parking in front, there are plenty of places to park nearby."

So Heaven on Seven it was. It&#39;s been years since we&#39;ve been to the one downtown, but it wasn&#39;t my birthday so I was going to at least try to eat healthy while there.

We walked in and waited. 

And waited.

And waited and waited.

Then we waited some more.

The funny thing is, only 3 tables in the entire restaurant were taken. But there was only one woman working the entire dining room. 

A blonde girl ran over to the hostess stand, said hi and walked away. Then she walked back to the hostess stand, told us she wasn&#39;t on the clock and then walked away again. 

I guess it would&#39;ve been too much to have her ask someone else to seat us?

So the manager, a cantankerous fellow, came out, greeted us (sorta) and sat us down without a well wish or a smile. We were obviously keeping him from doing something important.

Things got better from that point on. Our server more than made up for the crappy inattentive service we received at the beginning when we felt about as unwelcome as could be.

She was friendly, attentive and super nice. Drinks were refilled and brought out without haste. Meals arrived correctly and timely. She was a gem.

The food was quite good too. My wife ordered the fried green tomato appetizer. I took a bite and liked it, but limited myself.

Then we each had a cup of gumbo, which was amazing. I&#39;d go here again just for that. I&#39;ve been to the real N&#39;awlins and I have to say...I liked this better.

Our meals soon followed with her having an oyster/shrimp po&#39;boy and I had the low carb jambalaya, which was a lie because the sauce was super sugary. It&#39;s ok, tho. I&#39;m not counting carbs, just trying to be healthy overall. There was tons of meat (chicken, shrimp and sausage) along with onions, peppers and spices. I didn&#39;t love the sauce it was in. Tasted a little too ketchuppy. Maybe it works better over rice so the rice can absorb some of that sweet sauciness. 

For dessert Laura got a free order of bread pudding thanks to the Yelp check in offer. It looked and smelled amazing too. Very sweet, huge portion and covered in caramel goodness. I may come back on cheat day for that.

So overall, good food, excellent service, and a jerk of a manager. The end."

I have tried several of their sandwiches, including the sausage onion. The onion was done very well almost like caramelized with pepper and garlic, I believe. Complimented the strong taste of the sausage!"

First of all, if you don&#39;t have a reservation they will put you on the list and take your mobile number so that you are not stuck there while you wait. We had about 45 minutes to walk around downtown Naperville, and it was great.

Shortly after we were seated our server came to take our order. He answered our questions, and we placed our order. He was very knowledgeable, and made some great suggestions.

My wife ordered the Salmon, which was fantastic (yes, I did taste it). Perfect blend of spices and heat. Loved it.

I ordered the Voodoo Chicken pasta. I loved it. Just the right amount of heat and flavor. The chicken was tender and moist, the noodles were cooked al dante, so they were not mushy or soggy. The Voodoo sauce was incredible. Love Heaven on Seven."

I had the crab cakes which were good, and the the shrimp creole linguini. The shrimp had the worst takes I have ever had. I had to spit the first bite out, because I almost got sick trying to eat it. However that is not the main reason I am upset. The waiter was very nice and customer service oriented, but the manager on duty was down right rude. When she came over and I told her why I couldn&#39;t eat the meal, and she tried to question my knowledge of how seafood should taste. She was very disrespectful to the point to where I did not want to try anything else. If I could give this place a negative 3 stars I would for her service alone. I am more than happy to pay for good food and service, but she was absolutely horrible, and the shrimp was bad. I will say again that the waiter was very nice and professional. The manager Sandi need to take lessons from her staff. I have never left a place so upset before. That was unacceptable"

We also ordered Jambalaya, and it was ok, not bad, but certainly not worth coming back. Major disappointment, as this was not Cajun food. It was food, no different than you can get at a thousand other places. If you want creole, or Cajun food, go to Papadeux in Westmont, it is far better!

Okay, here&#39;s my deal with downtown Naperville during the brunch hour: everyone walks really slow, there&#39;s no parking, and finding a breakfast place with booze was a task. (I&#39;m spoiled by Chicago. No doubt.)

And then, like a big cajun angel, Heaven on Seven came into my life. I was so cranky by the time we sat down, hangry some may say, but that mimosa wiped away all my worries! Their drinks (Yeah! I had a few!) were really well made. 

Let&#39;s go back to the french toast, shall we? That banana&#39;s foster french toast just makes me want to drive all the way back out there to get some. I&#39;m not kidding. It was like an explosion of happiness. Rum, butter, bananas and DEEP FRIED SUGAR BREAD. It&#39;s like a delicious sponge for your hangover!! I just...want more...so badly. 

Our waitress was amazing...I feel like maybe her name was Amanda? (Owners, if you&#39;re reading this, it was a Saturday morning, she&#39;s got long brown hair, she&#39;s pint sized, and she HUSTLED! Great hire.) 

Here&#39;s the deal: the lunch crowd SLAMMED them. It was really calm and then like 12:00 rolled around and apparently the entire city of Naperville decided that&#39;s what they wanted to eat. There were only two waiters, they were having to make drinks, and I think one manager. The poor bus boy was sprinting around trying to clear as fast as he could as well. I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s normal, but they got hit hard. It would be a perfect 5 star review, but I know they kept people waiting. Lucky for Heaven on Seven, my boyfriend and I wouldn&#39;t let our fellow patrons get cranky because we kept telling them how amazing the food was. (Can I get a gift card for that?)

Really great experience all around. The food was great, the drinks were awesome, and our waitress was a doll!"

I ordered an etouffee of the day and it was amazing. It had a little bit of every protein they had and you just have to try it yourself. Portions are big. My friend ordered a ordered fried tomato and shrimp salad. The fried tomatoes are actually very good. However, I&#39;d stick with the gumbos and etouffees. The complimentary cornbread was fantastic. The butter that came along was really sweet, never had butter like it before and it is dangerously good.

I used to come here at least monthly not so much anymore. I usually go for the chili but it&#39;s been pretty inconsistent. They also changed the size of the bowls they use so they still charge $8 for a bowl of chili but you get about half the amount. I asked the manager about it and he blamed the kitchen staff and said they must have used the wrong bowl. It was the same thing the next time. Honestly, it&#39;s really just poor form to blame the staff, they all work really hard and are generally pretty nice.

I AM SO DISAPPOINTED I DIDN&#39;T GO EARLIER! With half my family from Louisiana, it&#39;s a shame I waited this long. For same. 

I first came here a month ago for brunch. It&#39;s one of the only spots in the suburbs that is not a bar, that serves bloodies and mimosas for brunch. We were not disappointed. Bloody mary&#39;s were spicy, but not to worry, because if they weren&#39;t spicy enough, I had 12 bottles of hot sauce on the table to choose to add. For my meal, I had the Poached Eggs on Crabcakes with Creole Sauce. SO delicious. It was light (unlike the 4-egg omelettes!), but filling, and I just about licked the creole sauce off the plate. Just the right amount of savory, and the homemade crabcakes just flaked apart. Delish.

After this, I knew a return was quick to be had. I was so excited to try the gumbo! Now, I&#39;m no stranger to gumbo, and this stuff was incredible. Much thicker, almost gravy-like. I didn&#39;t dislike that style at all, it was still tasty, and had a warm, peppery taste. 

For dinner I had the tilapia with crab cakes. I wanted to venture out, but the crab cakes were so good before, that I couldn&#39;t pass them up. It was delicious! I didn&#39;t even need the rice. The flavor was incredible.

I have to say, I have read numerous reviews about portion sizes here. Either they&#39;ve changed, or ya&#39;ll don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about. After a small cup of gumbo, I had a hard time even finishing half of my meal, and the other came home with me. And I am no light eater.

Since I checked in on Yelp, we got a free dessert to split. It would have cost $7, and between three girls, we couldn&#39;t finish half. The chocolate peanut butter pie was so rich, with a wonderful crust. 

Service is friendly and prompt, and the decor is cozy and very NOLA-themed. I just wish it was a bigger restaurant!"

I went there once a few months ago with a colleague, and we got delivery from there through grubhub last night, and I&#39;m sorry. I tried. I can&#39;t. I&#39;d say it&#39;s me, but it&#39;s not. It&#39;s you. You&#39;re so average. So expensive and average.

Your decor is dark and old and a little bit chintzy. Your chairs are rickety and outdated, and your setup is weird. We sat at a teensy tall table near the windows, and thank goodness you were mostly empty, because I dunno where anyone at a table near us would have gone.

Your service is fine. Average. Nothing amazing. I ordered a chicken fried steak, my colleague, a shrimp dish. I apologize, Ho7 (may I call you Ho7? It&#39;s kinda catchy and makes me feel cool. Thanks.) for not being more descriptive, but you see, I can&#39;t REMEMBER WHAT IT TASTED LIKE. Either dish! I mean I remember not throwing up or punching my fist through a window or crying, so I know it wasn&#39;t bad, but it wasn&#39;t memorable, either. And it was expensive! And forgettable! 

So time went on, Ho7, and you showed up on grubhub. We hadn&#39;t seen each other in awhile and I did that thing where you whitewash your past together - &#34;actually, I think it was pretty good!&#34; I told myself. &#34;Look at these prices, it has to be pretty tasty!&#34; Chimed in my husband, enabling you to easily weasel your way into our Friday night delivery meal. And so you did. We ordered oysters, a fried chicken po&#39; boy, grits, onion rings, and peanut butter chocolate cake. We kind of got excited as we waited, and we were SUPER impressed that you arrived early, that you were packaged sensibly, and you were delivered hot. We had faith in you, Ho7. But then we tried you.

Those two stars up there? They&#39;re for those Cajun onion rings. Oh man were those tasty. Fried, crispy, a little spicy. Delish. Then I went on to the grits. I opened the container ecstatic to try fancy grits, and BAM! I was inundated with the smell of armpit. Yes, the Parmesan reggiano combo of cheese you threw in these grits SOMEHOW made for a feet like-aroma that was difficult to get past. I somehow did, to find that they tasted similarly. We threw the full container away.

Hubs said he loved the oysters, but he sure didn&#39;t finish them. As for the po boy, it was a large, dry, flat piece of fried chicken on a toasted roll with lettuce and tomato. No sauce. No flavors. Just an awkward shaped piece of chicken. I managed to get half of it down before giving up. The pie was okay. I ate half of that too. Here&#39;s the thing though. For $79 for two people to eat DELIVERY FOOD, I don&#39;t want just half a damn sandwich and feet grits. I want delicious food! I want spicy Cajun craziness and layers of flavor! I want excitement, Ho7! WHAT ABOUT MY NEEDS?!

I tried so hard, Mr. OnSeven, but I can&#39;t do it. I hope you find diners who love you, and offer you 5 star reviews. I hope they make you happy. I want you to be happy.

...Just not with me."

Masala is a decent option if your looking for a cheap quick dinner in the Warrenville area and staying off of Diehl road. I would say that the food is somewhat Americanized, which is a good thing for some. The menu has a nice selection with descriptions if you&#39;re unsure of the dish.

Two things that you can appreciate:
1. The level of spiciness can be adjusted( Some like it hot, some don&#39;t)
2. They left the water pitcher on the table, so your glass is kept full."

Variety of items at the buffet: 5 stars. There was plenty to choose from I&#39;m always glad to see South Indian meat dishes at the buffet. I didn&#39;t even bother to try the usual tandoori chicken or naan because they had quite a large selection of items that you normally don&#39;t see. The chicken vepudu (or varuval or dry masala) was great. The goat curry was very tender. All their chutneys were great but the idly was not the best. the Spinach dal, mushroom chili, the potato fry were all pretty decent. The biryani was not bad either. They even had paya (a goat leg soup which is a delicacy in some parts of southern india). I didn&#39;t care for the Apollo fish. Desserts and boondi was great.

Overall, I&#39;m not sure if I should praise or complain but most of the dishes were under salted. Usually I don&#39;t care for salt but it was certainly less even for me. Some items were just the right spice some were less spicy. Despite the selection, I wasn&#39;t too awed by the flavors. 

Service was friendly and it&#39;s nice to see plenty of other south Indians dining here (always a good sign)."

I agree with SJ Yelp review. I also came here for the first time on Memorial Dayy. One one hand I am happy they were open as they are usually closed, however they of course increase the price for the holidays. Maybe I am not as familiar with north and south food, but some of the tasty dishes such as tikka masala were nowhere to be found. There was your typical salad spread which I did not touch along with chutney. The tandori chicken was a tad on the cooler side and was served on the buffet table. I was concern with the temperature, but I still ate it. The spinach paneer was likely the star of the buffet with ample amounts of cheese. They had a variety of fried indian carb items which were good. The chicken briyani also was on the luke warm side which lessen its appeal. They did have goat curry which is always hearty. Finally the dessert was a huge let down. No mango ice cream. They did not have the traditional rice pudding as well. Instead there was a variety of odd tasting desserts which you can check out in my pictures. Finally it took a long time for the naan to come out. It was not fluffy nor did we can a refill while we ate. 

Pros: AYCE indian, different items than your typically buffet, free Chai

Cons: Higher price than other indian buffet, lukewarm tandori chicken and other dishes

Hidden deals:
Cheaper normally on weekdays than weekend. Not sure if it is the same food."

It was way bigger than the plate. The gulab jamun reminded me of the spongy meatball soaked in floral sweetness. Samosas rocked and everything else excellent.

it was rather a special occasion for me, because not only my wife (kids mom) was with us but also my mom since our parents are visiting from India. We called ahead and made a reservation knowing the place would fill up fast on a day like this. the guy on the phone told us it was $14.99 for the buffet,  and they did not offer a menu selection for lunch. 
we got there a few minutes after our reserved time and we only had a short wait,  they were able to get us a table for 6. Ok, we headed off to the buffet mingling with the crowd. Typical Masala spread, jilebis and what we took to be bondas or vadas, right at the beginning - turned out later they had a sweet filling. 

But the whole buffet seems very much a bunch of assorted things offered by a management who is confused about their identity. I mean, there are hundreds  of dishes in Indian Cuisine,  so pick one region for God sakes, and stick with that theme.  Given that the management, staff and most of the clientele is typically from the southern (Andhra Pradesh) region, you find some Andhra style food on buffet menu. I would have liked to see a few spicy vegetable dishes in keeping with this theme. instead, they had one karela dish, and thats it. The other selections were mushy Pongal,  &#34;papdi chat&#34; (bland), pav bhaji (bland), dal, sambar and rasam, and Chinese noodles and fried rice. Seriously guys ?! I think they were just focused on getting as many Indians to come in for Mother&#39;s day as possible and therefore went with a &#34;something for everyone&#34; plan. 

Don&#39;t expect anything from Andhra chef trying his hand at papdi chat or pav bhaji. Pongal, sambar and rasam- all can be had at Aurora temple, much better for fraction of the price. They had something they called &#34;mysore bonda&#34;, well my family is from Bangalore / Mysore , this is nothing like it. Two words- potato filling,  not unspiced dough balls. Tip for the cooks, go to any Gujarati joint and try their bataka vadas. 

Dessert was disappointing too- where was the mango ice cream or at least jamuns? they ran out of cake (not kidding) and brought out some goop calling it custard,  it wasn&#39;t even sweet. 

Now the final blow. 4 adults and 2 kids , the lady rang us up $110!!! Here is her story-
the buffet is $16.99 not $14.99 as we were originally told (so we were misled). Mothers Day- just use any excuse to overcharge for your same food knowing that Indian Moms will come trooping in.......
taxes... looks waaay more that 8.5%
SERVICE Charge of $15 since we were 5 and above in our party. Seriously?! for what, clearing our plates and refilling a water jug? it&#39;s self service buffet for crying out loud!  
She told me that any restaurant would be doing this, including American restaurants. Ha, I differ... it&#39;s EIGHT or more not five.  

overall, unsatisfactory experience and unpleasant check shock. I&#39;m giving out 3 stars only because we were seated relatively quickly. There are lots of other much better places to go for an occasion."

Now, in Masala&#39;s defense, Indian buffets are not good representations of a restaurant&#39;s general taste.

Call me a liar, but you disagreeing with me doesn&#39;t change it. 

I don&#39;t mind the buffet food served here. I&#39;m frequently ordering food my toddler will eat, so I am quite used to having to eat blander food when she&#39;s tagging along. But my Indian friend would leave me to eat alone."

(Slow day at work,  don&#39;t judge). This is one of the good Indian restaurants I have been too. Good service, the place is always crowded especially on weekends and for buffets. Their gobi manchurian is to die for. Their buffet spread is large and good, provided you get there early or else you are just left with scraps or just the gravy. The biryani they serve at the buffet is good and spicy. Only thing is if you are not a big fabn of spicy food, clearly let them know in advance cause I cant handle too much heat and I have been in trouble more than once. (No that doesn&#39;t mean you can strip the Indian card away from me..lol)

One the whole good restaurant if you want good flavorful Indian food. Will definitely be here soon."

This time I upped the pressure and had a real Indian guy not only come with,  but also order the real stuff for us. 

Well, they nailed it again so I guess it&#39;s not luck afterall, but just a really good Indian Restaurant with both northern and southern style food, though our friend believesb it was the ordering genius that mage 5 the difference.  Monster sized Dosa served with coconut chutney,  spicy dip and some tomato vegetable lentil sauce was impressive to say the least.  The Malki Kofka was also excellent, the lamb tender and tasty. 

I am more interested than ever in taking on the weekend buffet,  which I heard draws big crowds of Indian and non native Indian diners, a statement to how serious this place is for Indian food. Maybe joining those making donations to the God Ganesh by the front door will help me get a table for the buffet."

It was pretty empty, but maybe it&#39;s more of a lunch place (we saw a giant buffet).  So, the service was very good and fast.
We started with Samosas and they were big, warm and flavorful.  The green dipping sauce was tasty with them.  Being that it was my first time at this restaurant, I got my go-to meal of Chicken Tikka Masala and my husband got the Lamb Vindaloo.  The Vindaloo was delicious and it had a nice kick to it (he ordered it medium spicy), but sadly the Tikka Masala was way too thick/creamy and did not have a ton of flavor compared to other places I&#39;ve been, despite being VERY orange in color...almost too orange...why was it soooooo orange?  We had a side of Garlic Naan which was perfectly charred and buttery, so I loved that.
Even though I didn&#39;t love my order, everything else was really tasty, so I&#39;d give this place another shot and try something else."

There was no taste in the food. We were there for almost 1 and half hour. We did not get masala papad nor the beverages we ordered. Every time we asked they said it was coming.

Lunch buffet - has a big spread of items. The appetizers are very tasty (pakoras, chaat items etc). They have idlis with chutney and sambar. My favourite item has always been the pongal (khichdi). The consistency is excellent and the flavors are very tempting. The tandoori items are ok and come with naan bread. They also have a typical Andhra entrees (like vankaya koora i.e. egg plant curry). The dal, rasam and sambar have been acceptable. I am a vegetarian, so do not have any views on the other section of the buffet table.

When we go for dinners, they serve a la carte. They have a good selection of indo chinese food. I just had the paneer 65 that wasn&#39;t too bad. I would have liked it to be more spicy, but overall it was a good dish. The chinese fried rice was tasty. We have also tried the rocket dosa here a few times.. The last time we tried it the chutney was also fresh. (In the past the coconut chutney has had a old/stale taste to it).

Overall a good restaurant... the manager and owner are very friendly.. cant say the same thing about rest of the staff.

Now for the main question - will I be back? yes.. may be once in 3 months.."

I ordered my favourite dish, Chicken Tikka Masala, and he ordered the Chicken Vindaloo. 

I had initially asked for extra spice on mine and was dismayed at it&#39;s presented mildness. However, within minutes of presenting the food, our server approached us and inquired about the spice level. Before I could even request more spice, he offered to spike either of our meals if they weren&#39;t at the right heat level. I was impressed! By the time he brought it back, it had reached spiciness perfection. I also appreciated the vegetable medley amongst the chicken. I&#39;ve never had that before when I&#39;ve ordered this dish! It was a nice little addition.

Also, the Chicken Vindaloo is the best I&#39;ve ever had. Ever!

Both entrees were accompanied by rice, and we also ordered a side of naan. 

My only complaint is that we had to pay for the papadums [$4 for 2!], which are typically served on the house! 

Spectacular restaurant though, and you won&#39;t be disappointed!"

Review is for the lunch buffet only. Excellent spread, indian food prepared mainly in south indian style. The dishes included carrot poriyal, sambhar, paneer tikka masala, chicken tikka masala, veg biryani, lamb and some soft of &#34;chicken-65 biryani&#34; which didn&#39;t look very appetizing to me.

This has some pretty good decor, they used the Bar also as an extended restaurant, which I thought was good use of the space, eveything was laid out in an informal way. The lunch buffet had limited options but was pretty good. In the vegetarian side - the Gobi Manchurian and Paneer Butter masala, both were really good. Couple of nice south indian breakfast items - pongal, vada, uthappam, idly, we had a little bit of a confusion as to where the chutney&#39;s where. The non-vegetarian had good options in terms of variety, but the two standouts for me were the fish curry (kerala) and the Keema Fry. Lot of sweets - jalebi, laddu, payasam.

The funny thing here is - I think when they ran out of a particular dish - especially for the sweets, they made something utterly new. Like there was Kesari written on the placard, but Carrot Halwa was served, similarly Dhahi Papdi Chaat was written, but just boiled channa (chickpeas) was served. But, I felt paying a bill of $133 ~ $22 per person for the lunch, was not worth it. It&#39;s probably like $5 more expensive than it should be. The place was packed when we entered, so they do serve pretty good food, but they can bring down prices by $3/4 (my opinion)."

Cons: service is not too great. Our order was taken but then not fully submitted to the kitchen so they say so we had to keep asking for our food items and that really  took too long! Bathrooms were extremely dirty. On a Saturday night, place wasn&#39;t even that busy. A few tables other than us and yet service was just not up to par.

I tried to avoid this area around lunchtime (seriously, have you ever tried to make a left to get back out onto Diehl road?!) but after attempting lunch at another Indian place that isn&#39;t open for business yet, I decided Masala would do.

Upon entering, I was greated warmed and the man asked me &#34;two?&#34; Seeing as how I walked in alone, (unless I have a ghost following me) I shook my head and told him I&#39;d like to order something to go. He said that wasn&#39;t a problem and handed me a menu. Nice guy, though. Since I didn&#39;t learn his name, I&#39;ll just call him Bob.

Looking around, this place looked pretty fancypants. There are chandeliers, and theres an on-site banquet facility as well. The main dining area wasn&#39;t overly bright, but you didn&#39;t need a lantern to eat your food, either. The place had a good, cozy ambiance. 

The menu was quite large and impressive. It seemed as though there was a little bit of everything under the sun. I decided on the Chicken Tikka Masala (I&#39;ve really grown to like this dish). I would have gotten a bottle of water, but they did not have any. As I placed my order, Bob tried to get me to try the AYCE lunch buffet not once, but twice because it&#39;s cheaper. Listen, I get it buddy; I&#39;d LOVE to spend $12 and stuff myself full of meats, salads, and naan. But I have an hour for lunch. I had already used up a quarter of that getting here; I&#39;d be lucky to get back in time to sample my lunch before my 1:00 p.m. meeting. Loved his salesman tactics, though. I should have asked if he&#39;d like to sell cars at my bf&#39;s work.

After placing my order and paying ($14 plus $1 tip), I waited about five minutes for my order. As another employee handed it to me, Bob told me that he gave me a side of the bread, even though it wasn&#39;t included with my original order. Awesome! Unexpected naan is the best! I thanked him and headed out.

I won&#39;t get into the horrors of attempting to return to work- let&#39;s fast forward to the food. I open my containers and see a good sized portion of Chicken Tikka Masala. The sauce was fragrant, the chicken was delicious all-white meat and tender, and the rice (in a separate container on the side) was good. A bit bland, but once it was mixed into the chicken, it tasted just fine. The naan was soft and warm, and was a great dunking vessel for the CTM.

I&#39;ll definitely go back again, but not for lunch. As much as I&#39;d like to try the AYCE buffet, there&#39;s just not enough time during the week (maybe if I took a day off...). It would certainly have to be on off-peak hours too so I don&#39;t have to spend 15 minutes just trying to exit the damn parking lot."

I had the vegetarian thaali and it was AWESOME. It was like a mini buffet just for me and everything tasted fantastic. Even then, the place was a bit dirty (food on the tablecloths), which was a bit of a turn-off. 

In June 2015 I returned for their lunch buffet on a Friday. This buffet is the reason I will not return. The restaurant was very dirty - the tablecloths were still stained with drips of sauce, leading me to feel like they don&#39;t wash them often. Everywhere we walked our shoes stuck to the floor. What was worst was that the buffet where the food was served was very dirty. The galub jamun had things floating in the syrup... things that shouldn&#39;t be floating in there. Additionally, the food wasn&#39;t good this time. I am vegetarian and there weren&#39;t many options for me - I had a serving of palak paneer, and when I went back for more they had put out another batch, and it didn&#39;t taste the same as the first. They&#39;re not consistent. My fiance tried the different meats and complained that they left many small bones in the meat that you could not notice until you had already put the food in your mouth and were chewing. Additionally, it cost us $14 per person for this buffet... much more than our favorite restaurant&#39;s Sunday buffet!"

Both were delicious, with very creamy sauces. We felt pretty ripped off on the dessert ($5 for two small pieces of gulab jamun). 

Our waitress was super unfriendly. I mean, super. Like, almost hostile.

Facility wise, the restaurant is well decorated with nice bathrooms. However, there is no changing table in the restroom which is a big irritant for my family and always kinda makes me feel like I should change my babe on the table (not to worry, I never actually do...)

Since I&#39;ve drafted this review, we&#39;ve been back once for the buffet and it was both enormous and crowded. Most of the dishes were appealing, but they could have done a better job keeping the buffet replenished. In fairness, I think there was also a party going on at the same time, which may be out of the ordinary for them.

Despite the negative points (our server, lack of changing table, and crazy buffet), we&#39;ll be back sometime since I have very fond memories of the paneer."

My Husband &amp; i have dined here 4 times since January 2015, &amp; our experience from the food to the staff gets better with every visit.  The food is a little bit more expensive here than at some competing Indian restaurants, but in this case, you really do get what you pay for, &amp; nothing in illinois, not even on Devon, can compare to Masala! 
Usually we come here for the truly superior,fresh,delicious buffet, which is inclined towards South Indian, yet includes many North Indian dishes too. The buffet presents several meat selections, while remaining completely vegetarian friendly ( which is a concern for us personally). Plenty of gluten free options too if you fly that way. On our last visit we ordered off the menu for the first time. The Mirchi Bajji ( deep fried green chilis in chick pea batter) were amazing ( yes, spicy) &amp; the coconut chutney &amp; Mango lassi are always perfect.  The Paneer Tikka Masala was excellent. If you are not vegetarian, but want to try something veg, those 2 items are great places to start. The always present owner, Krishna, has always been there to greet us when we arrived, &amp; even during a busy lunch hour, will make a point to go to each table to make certain that everything is satisfactory.

I am very skeptical of the Indian and Chinese and Thai restaurants because they have been extremely successful in disappointing me with their food. Not that they had unhygienic produce or disgruntled owners/waitresses, but they lacked the perfection that a particular cuisine demands. I say this because I&#39;ve had some really authentic food so those just didn&#39;t match up. 
I have been to quite a few Indian restaurants in Rochester, NYC, Philly and its suburbs (because I live here) and none of them impressed me with the mind boggling flavor and aroma - the one which makes you drool. Literally. 
A few weeks ago, I was in Chicago for a vacation. So my good old friend, who lives in Lisle, suggested me this place one evening. Went there, was pretty late so I ordered 2 portions of Hyderabadi Dum Biryani and 2 portions of Andhra Chicken Fry. Each of those items were just exquisite in their own world - looked perfect, tasted even perfect. The spices on the Chicken Fry was not extremely rough but it did exude a gentle peppery flavor. The Biryani, however, blew everything out of the water. The chicken was marinated at just the right amount and the rice was very good - non-sticky and had some unusual flavor to it which made me wanted to eat it over and over again. Since the food was so good, I complemented it with my Dewars 15 Years scotch:)
I woke up the next morning with a Chicken Biryani hangover and I suggested a couple of my friends for the Lunch Buffet at Masala. I was pleasantly surprised when I found that their buffet menu had equally good food as their √† la carte. The salads, chicken gravy, paneer masala (cottage cheese), the exceptional dal (lentils) and even the table-served chicken tandoori kebabs had just the right amount of taste which made me write this review. 

This was a really good experience! I just can&#39;t wait to go to Chicago again to try out their other dishes. So long!"

Tried out a few Menu Items over the past couple of months, here&#39;s the review.

Lunch Buffets : They have a good variety of dishes. Mutton Keema, Biriyani and Apollo Fish are the highlights.The Naan is soft. Overall, the buffets are just like any other Indian Buffets. There&#39;s no Wild Factor. It&#39;s around $15 on weekends.

Ala Carte : I&#39;ve tried both Mutton and Chicken Biriyani. They are made in Hyderabadi dum style. The Spice level is moderate and the blend is excellent. Would definitely recommend these.

This week, I tried their Non-Veg Thali. I&#39;m pretty sure some of the dishes are from afternoon&#39;s buffet, just topped with Cilantro. Mango Dal and Mutton Keema were good but, Palak Chicken was bland. Papad wasn&#39;t served with the Thali.(dissapointed).Sambar and Rasam tasted good. A piece of Tandoori chicken was served hot.(happy) The desert of the day is Gulab Jamun, which was soft.(thankful)

The Ambiance : The place is spacious. Too much lighting. There are some noticeable wall hangings. 

Every time someone finishes, they roll off the paper on the table and replace with a new sheet. Reminded me of marriage dinners. :)

The place is well maintained. Crowded for Weekend Lunch buffets, but I haven&#39;t seen many customers during dinner.

The owners are always around, talking to customers and they are very friendly."

If you are a single female, expect only one complementary chicken drumstick on a plate rather than a hot platter with at least two pieces and they do not offer to fill your water glass for you or ask if you would like more warm naan.  That was the first hint.

But what really galled me was at the end when they presented me the tab for my meal, I was fumbling in my wallet for the correct amount and having enough to leave a cash tip.  The usual tip for these restaurants is anywhere from 0-10%, and I&#39;ve seen many leave with no tip at all.
The total bill was about $12 for myself.  The waiter said, &#34;Let me help you&#34; and proceeded to help himself to a protruding $10 and $5 bill and the tab.  I waited for my change, sipping water.  And waited.  And waited.  I never got a receipt, so I went to the front desk and asked for my change.  His face visibly changed as he turned his attention from a conversation he was having with his other waiter buddy and started rifling through receipts in a drawer.  He handed me one with the correct amount and demanded that I sign it (I was paying cash, wtf?) and he handed my my $3+ change.   Ummm I don&#39;t think his service OR his attitude was worth a tip over 25%!  I&#39;ll think very carefully before I come back to a place with sexist waitstafff!"

So with the bar being set high, this place is pretty darn good! Ive had the veggie, lamb, chicken dishes, various naan.Ive eaten their food 4 times and every time its been yummy!

I haven&#39;t had seafood choices yet, I tend to think that real indian food doesn&#39;t really utilize fish or shellfish much; but I could be wrong.

Anyway Service is friendly, place is clean. I feel theres a good quanitty of food for the dollars being spend. A big, big criterion for me.

 I orded takeout twice, and both times it came rolling out of the kitchen exacly on my requested time.  


Its only a minor comment here, but the vegetable vindaloo made me wonder if they were using frozen/bagged veggies; the carrots may have had a freezer burn taste, but it was tasty enough to make me lose my train of thought.

I do not like fried foods of any sort, so would like to see a couple other options available from their appetizers. every one of them is fried in some way.

But other stuff is very good.The flavors are solid, but not strong or overpowering. Personally I like spicy spicy foods that border on over the top..........and the ones marked as spicy fit the bill;---- but I could actually take a little more heat if they offered it. But most mainstream eaters would find this place cool; good food, good service, good value for the money, and a really large menu selection.

Hope to keep coming back."

Definitely has good food, on par with maharaja near ohare and thumka in schaumburg. This place is only 5 minutes from my work, so i&#39;m glad. 

For naysayers, there will always be something to complain about - so here it would be the price ($16 after tip per person) or the acceptable service (this is not the place to expect 100% fawn all over you service).

I&#39;d rather pay for food quality and selection, cleanliness, and quick seating at lunchtime. They deliver 100% on all those counts.

Oh, and one last thing - free masala tea. NICE touch instead of trying to gouge me for it."

If you are truly into eating authentic Indian cuisine that represents the flavor, texture, and a bit of history of the different regions of India, you have to come here. I had the Mutton Dumka with basmati rice, and I enjoyed it so much that I took an entire second order home to my wife. I live in Atlanta, and we do have very authentic Indian cuisine there - but nothing like this!!!

I have been a food developer for many years now, and I have lots of experience with international cuisine. I selfishly sat for 10 minutes just savoring the entire menu - I have never seen so many great options in one restaurant! I even asked one of the staff to talk to me out the preparation of the dish, and he very wisely told me very little - a sign that they truly get how authenticity requires discretion. This is one of the places that I could really order one of everything in the menu, try it all, and enjoy the pain of overeating!!

His recommendation of pakoras for an appetizer was very good.  My friends had recommended I try butter chicken and garlic naan.  Both were excellent.  We also ordered lamb vinaloo which was incredibly hot and spicy even when ordered mild.  I liked that everything was served in pretty serving dishes  family style so we had as much as we wanted and were able to share and taste everything.

To make matters worse the prices were not outrageous, but definitely more than what I would have paid for dog food. 

It goes to note that we did not order dishes off the menu, so I gave them an extra star for the possibility that they make decent food when it is ordered and not made for a trough.

Guess we&#39;ll keeping looking.

Masala offers both North Indian and South Indian fares.  Our table stuck with dishes from the North Indian menu.

Dinner started with a couple of orders of papadum with tasty coriander and sweet tamarind chutney.   We quickly realized dishes at Masala tend to be spicy.  A couple in our party requested their food be prepared mild and the kitchen was happy to oblige.  

Indian beer is quite good and our table ordered Kingfisher and Taj Mahal.  I stuck with water as the restaurant doesn&#39;t really have a wine list.  My typical preference is to pair Indian food with viognier, dry riesling, or torrontes.

Getting decent service at Indian restaurants can be an issue but the folks at Masala were affable.

We ordered Pakoras and Samosas for appetizers.  For dinner we ordered Chicken Tandoori, Chicken Tikka, Mutter Paneer, and Aloo Gobhi.  The dinner accompany&#39;s included garlic naan, onion kulcha, and couple of orders of raita to wash it down.

Our dishes mostly lacked flavor.  The pakoras were tasty and spicy but were an unusual mixture of onions and chillies and maybe spinach strips.  Whatever happened to hardy potato and cauliflower pakoras?  We were disappointed at how bland the tandoor cooked Chicken Tikka was.  The Aloo Gobhi was spicy but lacking much flavor and also greasy.   The Mutter Paneer was prepared mild upon request but I&#39;ve had better.  The best part of dinner was the flaky and hot bread.  Especially the very &#34;garlicky&#34; garlic naan that I thoroughly enjoyed.       

Dessert for a couple of us included plates of hot gulab jamun which has always been a favorite dessert.  Now that was nice."

If you&#39;ve never had this south Indian breakfast item give it a try here. However that is where the quality ends. The butter chicken was horrible. They use way too much food coloring in it. Flavor was bland and not authentic. I&#39;m not sure what cut of chicken they used in it but I doubt it was tandoori chicken legs like the recipe calls for. I feel bad when people not familiar with real Indian food eat this stuff as it is misleading and causes them to dislike it based on bad items like this. Biryani was also poorly made. Too much mint and fenugreek flavors overtake the dish. Also too much food coloring again. If you want a great biryani go to Cumin restaurant in Chicago. If you want a great butter chicken the best I&#39;ve had was in India and I&#39;m still searching for a good one in the states.

Buffet is really good for both veg and non veg guys. Been here for dinner as well and its been really good. I would stop myself short of a 5 star because of below average deserts and uncooked naan they serve in buffet. spices are in right amount and service is decent. its been close the 80% occupied whenever I have visited it which vouches for its popularity in town.

First and foremost I have visited this restaurant many times and I have not encountered any issues regards food or service. They do get very busy at times so I can understand that you are not waited on hand in foot which yes if you go to dinner at 7pm on a Saturday you might not be attended to all your needs whenever you snap your fingers. This place is amazing some of the best Indian food that I have had (better than my moms, but don&#39;t tell her)

The restaurant ambiance is incredible, you feel that you are eating at a place that is clean and can appreciate the upkeep. I have eaten here on multiple occasions include the buffet and dinner service. I have pretty much tasted a large amount of the menu. I can say that for appetizers the Pakoras, Chicken Tikka, and Paneer are outstanding. For dinner the Dal Makhani and the Paneer Tikka my parents loved the kadai paneer and bhendi masala. Know to something I cannot describe but you have to go in and try yourself, are the chicken and lamb dishes. These are above and beyond my expectations and what keeps me coming back to this restaurant. Also they have a Dosa bar which is incredible and make fresh naan, because you can physically see someone making it.

Overall I can say that this place is a great experience to bring you and your family. I know some Indian families are limited on what they eat, but this place has ample choices that can fit any need. I needed to write this review because I actually believe that people have bad intentions and sometimes inaccurately portray someone&#39;s potential livelihood. If you want a great balance of north and south indian food Masala is something you need to check out."

The buffet had more items than the typical Indian lunch buffets I have been to giving it more variety and plate combos that I have to go back to try it all.  Great seperation of meat and veggie dishes which is always appreciated for those that don&#39;t &#39;eat it all&#39;. 

The service was prompt with the water refills and plate clearance.  I don&#39;t want to forget to mention the restaurant is very clean.. I like the simple decorations... the spices on the back wall are different and give the place a little eye candy.  

Only downside... the plates and bowls are several different sizes so make sure you grab the big ones to fill up!"

Hands down Masala is authentic, fresh, and delicious Indian restaurant I&#39;ve come across. My 350 guest engagement party was catered by Masala and I still get complemented on the taste 4 years later. The menu items were exactly as I ordered them and to the taste I wanted. They delivered on time and setup was perfect. Buffets are great and it&#39;s worth the wait as it says this place is rockin! Take this review coming from an Indian that Masala is delicious!.

The staff is very attentive and  will go the extra mile to make your experience and money worthwhile.  

I&#39;m surprised at some of the reviews as I know plenty of people who&#39;ve taken my recommendation to try this place have recommended more people to go.  

The manchurian appetizers, biryani, and their  paneer dishes are my favorite.  Naan is always so fresh and so soft I could eat it as a meal and the food always arrives hot and the serving sizes are enough for 3 adults. 

I&#39;ve been coming to Masala since it opened and will continue to go for buffets and dinners even though I live 20 miles from it I can&#39;t go anywhere else!!"

Went here for lunch, after watching a movie. Did not expect it to be so crowded. IT was a buffet style lunch. Service and ambiance is non-existent. The buffet is huge... it has options for everyone. Mostly consists of South Indian dishes... and that is what they excel in. I wish they would just stick to that, cos some of the dishes were really good. All in all, the buffet seemed like a hodge-podge, that has dishes like pancakes because it wants to please everyone&#39;s palate. But that is what works against this restaurant."

The food is tasty, plentiful, and different from the others around.  There&#39;s definitely a south Indian slant here, so things are not as creamy and ghee-filled as we usually see on buffets.  I have enjoyed every visit and walk out stuffed to the gills every time.  The people are nice too, and it&#39;s clean.  I recommend it highly!"

Too spicy for him &amp; just not my taste for me   Looked like a lot of Indians eating here so I&#39;m guessing that says the food is good &amp; authentic if you like Indian food.

It took about an hour and a half for them to deliver our pizza. I ordered the 10&#34; pepperoni lunch special. Pizza was barely lukewarm when it arrived so it wasn&#39;t the greatest. Flavors were just ok. I figured thin crust would be a little crispy but it was not. I probably won&#39;t be ordering from here again especially with how long they took and having to pay delivery for a pizza that&#39;s nowhere near hot.

Long story short, I ordered a supreme thin crust pizza and it was delicious. It arrived at my hotel room still hot and the driver was very courteous.  Unfortunately, I also ordered some fried mushrooms (cause I can&#39;t help myself) but they were salty and otherwise not very flavorful.  They came with a creamy garlic dipping sauce, but that was awful.  

All in all, I would absolutely order from them again if I get back to this area, because other than the bad shrooms, everything else was great.

I stopped by for a pizza and wow was informed that my favorite person who took my order was gone.She was a young woman with blonde hair. very sweet and kind. I was told by someone named Kim that she quit and she left everyone hanging. That she couldn&#39;t go visit her father for some event. I really didn&#39;t want her story just my pizza. This Kim went on and on and was not professional at all. I got my pizza and wow it was burnt and seemed like someone had blown there nose on it! I called the health department. I never ate it. Called Phil the manager and he said he couldn&#39;t believe it. Believe it you will. I have heard of food personnel being vicious  about food but please!

I arrived exactly 40 min after I placed the order. I waited 15 minutes in the resturant as the pizzas were not done yet. I asked how much longer it was going to be, they told me just 10 more minutes (their excuse was that stuffed pizzas take longer) 25 minutes later the pizzas finally finished, meaning it took them 1hr and 20 min to cook the pizza which I know it doesn&#39;t take that long to cook a stuffed pizza. The more likely thing that happened is that they forgot to make my order and just pretended like the pizza was taking a while. They didn&#39;t offer me any sort of compensation and the pizza wasn&#39;t even that good. Bad customer service and bad food gets 1 star."

For about $6.99 you can get a 10 inch pizza and a soft drink or bottled water or a whole host of sandwiches with fries and a drink. Where can you beat that?

Aside from their thin crust pizza, which is crunchy and super thin and topped with toppings to the edge, they make a good burger. The Belly Buster is grilled over an open flame and served on garlic bread with saut√©ed onions and American cheese. Simple and darn tasty! Plus the fries are crunchy and delicious. 

I&#39;m loving this place whenever I am feeling a righteous burger or a thin crust pizza. They are carryout only. 

Oh yeah. One thing I love about their pizza is they cut a round pizza into squares. Reminds me of the old days at Vito &amp; Nick&#39;s on the South Side. 

Give them a shout. They deliver too but they are so close to my house that I just can&#39;t wait for the delivery guy to show up at my door. I go get it from Lucano&#39;s!"

As noted in other reviews, it&#39;s the very thin cracker-like crust (which I like).  Also a fair amount of corn meal on the bottom (which I don&#39;t like, mostly because I hate having it all over my hands, but it&#39;s not as bad as I&#39;ve seen some places).  Crust had a little bit of carmelization on it, which has some appeal, but can be a bit polar as some find it looks a bit unappealing, but it&#39;s a pretty small crust overall.  Sauce was decent enough, it was no slouch in the cheese department.  The ingredients were quite chopped up.  So our mushrooms and onions were fairly tiny bits.  I don&#39;t know if they always do, but the pizza was party-cut (squares) quite small.

If you find yourself without coupons, they do have some on the website.  I believe it&#39;s carryout only.  Also, since I have people who care about such things, I note that they do apparently offer a gluten-free pizza as well."

We needed some fried chicken! It was worth the drive. I had the waffle chicken sandwich and son had 6 pc chicken basket. Everything was great! 

I will agree that it takes awhile to get your food. Wasn&#39;t expecting that, but it makes sense since it&#39;s made to order. If I lived nearby, I&#39;d definitely call ahead. Or bring a book. Hell, we could all stand to read more! Eat here + read a book = happy, well-fed, well-read citizen!"

You would never notice this little hole in the wall if you didn&#39;t hear word of mouth or see the great reviews on Yelp. But the food is excellent!

The fried chicken is very good, and the biscuits are exceptional! Seriously. I have never had such a perfect biscuit. Dip it in maple syrup, honey, BBQ, or hot sauce... you can&#39;t go wrong with this biscuit! The waffle was... a waffle (nothing wrong, and nothing special). And the mashed sweet potatoes were quite good as well.

But there is a real down-side, and that&#39;s the wait. I know good fresh food takes time, but not this much time. We were prepared for a wait. The Yelp reviews warned us to call our order in before we got there, and we were told on the phone earlier in the day that it takes about 20 minutes to fry the chicken made-fresh-to-order. So we expected a wait, and we called from the road about 15 minutes before we got there. The call went straight to voicemail, 4 or 5 times when we called, so we could not order by phone. We got to the restaurant, and found only 2 people working the kitchen at 6pm on a Saturday night, so they didn&#39;t have time to answer the phone. It took them about 8 minutes to acknowledge us at the counter. (After we placed our order at the counter, I watched the phone keep ringing until the owner or manager arrived at about 6:30pm.)

35 minutes after ordering (42 minutes after stepping up to the counter), the manager came out to the table where we were waiting with our kids, and told us they were out of biscuits, so it would be another 15 minutes to make fresh ones. About 25 minutes later (62 minutes after ordering), our food came out.

And the biscuits were amazing. The chicken was juicy and flavorful, not needing any sauce. But the waffle the chicken was served on was luke warm. (I think they sat waiting for biscuits.) And honestly, an hour wait is pretty long, even for an amazing meal, unless you have ambience to make the experience palatable. This place has no ambience. (It shouldn&#39;t. It should be a chicken-shack where you come get great chicken without paying for ambience... but then you can&#39;t make people wait AN HOUR in a room that feels like a take-out chinese store-front.)

So, I am still giving this 4 stars, because the food deserves every bit of that, even with a tepid waffle. I am going to give them another try, because the manager or owner who brought us our food was a very sweet lady, trying as hard as she could, but she was woefully understaffed. (I guess they realize it, because there was a hiring sign in the window.) However, I qualify my review by saying I would NEVER go there again, unless I had successfully placed my order before leaving my house. Hopefully they can get the kinks worked out on the service."

After a bumpy first visit, the owner more than delivered on the promise of making it right.  

She prepared and delivered a meal that was piping hot, the chicken was tender, juicy and delicious.  We tried the spicy and regular chicken, both were great. The roasted veggies were really good and even had sliced brussels sprouts in them, the fried pickles were delicious, the biscuits amazing, the entire meal was perfect...she even added the peach cobbler and it too was yummy! 

I am really happy with the food we received, but more than anything,  the means in which the  owner went  to make it right was above and beyond my expectations. 

Not everyone gives/gets a second chance to make a good first impression... I&#39;m glad I was able to experience the second good  first impression. If you visited during their crazy  grand opening week, I would encourage you as well to give them a second chance to make a good first impression.

The CiB Hot is fantastic. Great tasting fried pickles and be careful with their bread pudding... I think it&#39;s meant for 2, but good luck with that! I can&#39;t wait to go back. 

Cut cozy dining room. Fast casual with super friendly service. They only offer canned beverages... and they have Coke in a bottle if you must. I&#39;m trying to convince them to make biscuits. As a kid, every Sunday would be &#34;Chicken in a Basket&#34; with fries and biscuits in front of the TV. (We had to walk 8&#39; through shag carpet to change the channel back then.)

They may be serving cornbread soon too. The chef is open for suggestions, so be sure to let them know of any favorites you&#39;d like to see on the menu."

Staying in on a Friday night decided chicken and waffles sounded good.  Arrived at 6:00 pm and there were 4 or 5 tables with people sitting and one person in line ahead of me. With only two people working, they were vastly understaffed and unprepared for A Friday night.  It took over 50 minutes to get my simple two person take out order. When I arrived home, the order was partially wrong. As for the food, the Chicken had a good flavor, the waffle wasn&#39;t bad but was cold and slightly burned. Also tried the fried pickles which were undercooked.  I attributed all the problems to needing time to works out the kinks.

Update:  went back after about three weeks. This time on a Sunday night at 5:30. I asked how long it would take and was told 15-20 minutes. My order finally came out after 45 minutes, and was again wrong. Again, the food was good, but the service needs dramatic improvement."

So when I walk into this place and the entire middle eastern population of Lombard (20 people) are dining here you know it&#39;s a good sign.

As a minor league foodie this place was a find. The lunch combo with a drink costs around $8 and trust me when I tell you that every bite was great. The chicken was marinated perfectly in my number one Shwarma combo and the steak charred to perfection. The rice was even burstin with flavor and the salad... Well it was average but tasty. 

The reason for the four stars is entirely atmosphere. The booths are standard but need updating and the decorations are okay. Their credit card machine was on the fritz too. But my biggest beef was the heat. I understand it was hot outside but you&#39;ve got to compensate. That and there was absolutely no music at all so I ended up listening to this guy doing a sales pitch for the whole hour. And the fake coconut tree... I&#39;ll just leave it at that. Lol.

Regardless- you guys!!! Your product is incredible and pricing is on point. Get the atmosphere together and you will wipe the floor with pita inn down the road. Still I will be back.

This time, the smell from the bathroom was far stronger, plus they had no incense to cover it. This made for a far less pleasant lunch experience.

I tried their Shawarma lunch special, with Chicken and Steak. This was pretty standard fare, though very dry - both the chicken and steak. Not nearly as good as the Arabian chicken shawarma, prepared differently, which I had on my previous visit. Price was decent, at 6.99 for the special.

Another oddity was that there was only one other Caucasian couple in the restaurant while I was there until near the end when a single individual came in for lunch. This was during the lunch rush, so I hope it was due to the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday, tomorrow. Also, no music was playing in the background, only a music screen on the TV. It made for a very quiet, slightly awkward lunch experience with the cashier just gazing out over the restaurant.

Overall, not as fun as previously, and much work needed. To the owners, you need to get the sewage smell fixed! At a minimum, burn some incense to cover it, but this is not a good situation for a restaurant. Also, some music in the background will make your place much more inviting. I&#39;m sure you just ran out, but paper towels in the bathroom are much better than the small napkins which disintegrate when you try to dry your hands. ;-)"

I feel like you get your moneys worth here with lunch special pricing, but i wasn&#39;t blown away. The beef and kebab was delicious, the chicken was a VERY bland. One thing I don&#39;t like is, they don&#39;t have water. You have to buy water bottles for $1 each (I easily drink three water bottles while eating).

Ordered by number- since you&#39;d think that&#39;s why they number their entrees.... Woman working counter had no idea what numbers correspond to...  

Food: 
Beef/lamb kefta: very good. Spicy, moist and yummy. 

Beef shawarma: came out so bone dry and flavorless it was inedible. Toward end of my meal- cashier came around and asked how it was. Honestly told her it was very bad- dry and tasteless. She did the right thing- offered to remake dish until we were happy. 

2nd shawarma came out- this time it was clearly heated on grill with oil/sauce. Like magic- totally different dish. Much better. 

So- food, inconsistent. But made effort to remedy. 

Atmosphere- poor. Dirty and several workers loudly FaceTime with family in dining area at full volume. 

Weekend lunch prices are 2x weekday prices. So... Not a cheap lunch.

I asked for a water cup but they only have water bottles, which was fine with me. 

Note: Be careful when you sign the credit card bill and make sure you&#39;re being charged correctly. My initial receipt only charged me 75 cents so I asked the lady if this was correct and she thanked me for catching the error."

THE QUALITY OF THE MEAT, it was so tender and juicy, and everything was HOT and FRESH. They even asked if the food was good and if we needed anything else.

I wandered in, not knowing what to expect, and left happy and very satisfied. I ordered lunch combo #1, which is listed as beef and chicken shawarma topped with minced onions, sumac spice and comes with rice, salad and pita. 

It was sitting in front of me in less minutes than I have fingers on one hand. And for $7 my plate was packed with food. There was enough meat there for at least three sandwiches. It was hot, fresh and moist. The salad was very tasty, and the rice was decent; not at all dry. Plus the pita had a subtle garlic flavor.

You may recall some of my previous attempts to find this type of food. No? Well, let me refresh. All of it was dry and/or overpriced.

The Turkish coffee was very good. They were out of warbat, which was a shame considering I&#39;ve never tried it and was excited about trying something new. They called and asked if they could substitute baklava, which I okayed, with hesitation. The baklava was good, on par with baklava I&#39;ve had before, nothing special.

First, when I arrived I ordered the same thing I always do, two chicken shawarma plates (the wraps). One I substitute rice for fries because I do not like fries (I know I&#39;m weird but it is what it is). 

The new lady at the counter said &#34;I can&#39;t do that, that will be difficult for me&#34;. I told her I do it all the time and then she agreed to let me do it. By the way a side of rice and a side of fries cost a the EXACT SAME on their menu so this shouldn&#39;t ever be a problem. 

The lady then proceeds to ring me up, I hand her my debit card and she says &#34;oh it&#39;s not working, can you go to the tobacco shop and use their atm? 

So I say fine, I go to the ATM and pay their $2.50 fee to get cash (plus my bank&#39;s fee which I&#39;m not sure how much that is). 

I come back to see another worker has just fixed the machine. Why didn&#39;t she ask for help in the first place?!?!

Then the lady asked me how much the atm charged me, so I told her thinking maybe she was going to comp me something or replace it. Why else would she ask? She shrugged and said, that&#39;s not bad! It&#39;s not bad but there was no reason for me to have to do it in the first place if she had just asked her coworker or boss how to work the credit card machine. 

I then wait over 20 minutes for my to go order and when I finally get it she says &#34;we will no longer be able to sub rice for fries next time&#34;. I again told her that I do this all the time. She then replied that they &#34;hired her because people were making too many substitutions&#34;. 

Really subbing something that cost the same thing on your menu!?!?!? That makes no sense. 

My husband I used to eat here about once a week, needless to say they lost a customer today!"

I ordered the chicken kebab meal.
The chicken was perfectly grilled with a hint of charring on the outside and moist on the inside.
The spicy sauce had bite but was not too spicy. The white sauce was creamy and smooth.  Both excellent.
The salad was mint flavored and had no salt in it, a very nice complementary flavor.  The rice was moist and slightly salted.  The pita bread was toasted and crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.
This was the best chicken kebabs I&#39;ve had outside of greater Detroit.
Later, I tried the chicken kufta plate and that was as good as the kebabs.

I made a note to visit when they eventually opened. This evening, while driving by I saw an open sign and people inside so I decided to give it a try. 

I got in line while someone else ordered and waited for a few minutes to place my order as well. Once I had ordered I sat down and began the process of adding the business to Yelp gathering information off of the menu and business card. My order took quite a while to be ready (a little over 20 minutes) but my food was then brought out and it was time to dine. I ordered a Beef Shwarma sandwich and a bottle of water. 

The sandwich came wrapped up in a roll kind of like a burrito. There were grill marks visible on the bottom and it held together quite well. I took a bite and was immediately overwhelmed by a whole lot of different than I&#39;m accustom to flavors. The beef shwarma meat was tender and moist. There were lots of middle eastern spices which I can&#39;t identify giving it both a sweet and spicy combination that perfectly complimented one another. Tomato slices and onions were mixed in which gave it a little extra body. I&#39;d also say the sandwich was at least double the size I expected to be. Simply put I was very impressed as the overall combination of flavors created a decadent masterpiece of a sandwich. 

As I was eating and leaving I overheard that there would be an hour wait on Shwarma as they had run out, growing pains with a new business I guess. Assuming that they have food ready this place is definitely worth trying. Hopefully they&#39;ll maintain the quality (and quantity) of food I experienced as time goes on. Despite the name express (you&#39;d think it wouldn&#39;t take 20 minutes to have a sandwich ready), the Shwarma here was definitely fantastic. I&#39;m going to give this place a whopping five stars and say that this Shwarma did me no harma. This was an absolutely fantastic sandwich and I will surely be back again."

Apart from those 2 I&#39;m not so much happy with the shawarma which is a bit undercooked for my taste. Also the owner/Manager is a bit unorganized in taking orders and sending them out of the kitchen. There&#39;s some tables to eat but I&#39;d rather enjoy them at home or in the office for lunch thus the 3 stars."

No garlic sauce to go with the Hummous...that&#39;s a crime, and it was a pretty inferior Hummous, pretty tasteless.  The woman working the register was less than friendly, although she &#34;allowed&#34; a combination on the Hummous platter she seemed annoyed..what is the big deal?  It took FOREVER to get my order, takeout, considering it was 4:00 in the afternoon.  Not going back...that is for sure."

And he is absolutely right. There best dish is the shawarma sandwich ( beef and chicken, both amazing). Also the grilled meats are phenomenal as they are grilled over charcoal. All the meat is fresh, they prepare their own shawarma stack.

It&#39;s a new place but does have it&#39;s kinks, ex. Rice is okay. Um as for other things, staff is friendly and nice, the heat wasn&#39;t working, so it was really cold, and cuz of all the snow, the entry was wet and muddy.... But the charcoal grilled meat smell made me forget. The place seems busy

It&#39;s definitely a fresh change from the standard middle eastern spot

These people know meat and have a killer shawarma, it&#39;s def worth checking out. I will definitely go back"

I called ahead of time to place a lunch order and came in to pick up my food - the girl at the counter acted totally confused and started opening to-go orders to confirm which was mine.  Mind you the place was almost empty!  There wasn&#39;t much room for confusion.

The falafel is amazing one of the best I have ever had... they were so fresh, crunchy, and delicious. The humus and baba ghanoush were also great so if you are a vegetarian, this is a great place for you.

Their plates are delicious and they leave you so satisfied.  These plates are usually the lunch specials and are an excellent bargain.  

I ordered the Shawarma sandwich once and it needed more flavor and salt I was a little disappointed with that but everything else I have had here was great and made up for it.

Didn&#39;t think I&#39;d be able to find an acceptable substitute in the suburbs until I tried this place.  

I got the chicken shawarma and my husband got the falafel sandwich.  Both were extremely tasty and fresh.  The rice was nice and fluffy and flavorful (and much enjoyed by my toddler).  The shawarma was crispy and succulent and freshly carved.  Loved the hot sauce that came on the side as well as the warm pita and salad.  The falafel was by far the best I have had in the suburbs.

The service was wonderful.  The young guy behind the counter was very helpful and very sweet to my boy.  We ate there (not a whole lot of ambiance, but clean), but if we lived a bit closer I&#39;d probably just bring it home.  Also, good price.  Under $10 for a plate full of goodness.

So happy that I can satisfy my cravings without heading to the northwest side!"

Pluses: Decent selection of options, shawarma was really tasty, the mix was very nice to try all the different styles.
Negatives: A bit of a strange store front, pitas could use a bit of help, a bit pricey.
Recommendations: Try out the shawarma!

I ordered the shawarma combo which is beef and chicken shawarma on top of rice, a side salad and a whole pita.  The shawarma was sliced nice and thin was incredibly tender and seasoned well.  Salad wasn&#39;t anything exciting but gave a nice contrast to the rice and meat.  My wife ordered the shish kebab plate and the lamb was tender and juicy.

The only caveat I have to say about this place is we were the only people in the restaurant and food was a little slow coming out.  Also I didn&#39;t see any glasses for water and all drinks were either bottled or canned."

Chicken Shawarma was filled with rubbery thin pieces of chicken and not much flavor, also the Shawarma&#39;s had a garlic thick sauce that was awesome. 
The place was clean and I notice one customer that was waiting for a long time for his order and he was growing inpatient, he walk a couple times to the gentleman behind the counter and the reason for that, there were no waitress on the clock.

It was pretty empty when we came in so we sat where ever we wanted.  The inside was very clean-smelling, which is not a bad thing.  We ordered easily enough and then we say down to wait for our food, which we had been advised would take a while.  It took about 10 minutes and everybody&#39;s items came out at different times.  I had a falafel platter that was pretty decent.  I would have maybe liked a fresher pita but the falafel was nice and crispy and the hummus was pretty good, too.  Other folks had the kababs, which were well-received, and the mix if different meats, which were a hit, as well.

The good was not bad overall.  It took time to receive our items but since they were being prepared and we could see the folks doing the work, that was fine.

The first couple times I tried their food I thought it was kind of &#34;meh,&#34; but after a couple months of hiatus I gave it another go... and boy am I glad I did!

I did find two rather long hairs in my baba ghanouj, but it&#39;s not really a big deal and I suppose mistakes happen. I mean, there are a lot of things you could find in your food that are worse than hair, and no one can really control when a hair decides to detach itself from their head... Anyway, the food was good!

The interior is nice: clean, well-lit, well-decorated. It&#39;s one step up from any privately owned fast food joint you&#39;ll visit in the Chicago suburbs. We&#39;ve never dined in here - we always order carry-out - but we wouldn&#39;t feel uncomfortable eating here other than the fact that it can be pretty empty sometimes. If you go in during rush hour you&#39;ll find a lot of shirt-and-tie types swinging in for a bite to eat after work. It&#39;s good to know other people appreciate Shawarma Express too.

The falafel is well-spiced and has a great crunch to it. It wasn&#39;t overly dry and didn&#39;t go soggy on the drive home, either. 
The hummus is good - it&#39;s hard to go wrong with basic hummus. 
For me, it&#39;s all about the baba ghanouj. The baba here has an awesome smoky flavor and is served up a little chunky (which I love), with some fresh herbs and spices sprinkled over the top. If you want to cut back on the fat ask them for &#34;no oil&#34; on the hummus and baba - they&#39;ll be perfectly accommodating and leave it off for you.
Their tabbouleh tastes fresh and isn&#39;t mostly bulgur like at some places. It&#39;s got a lot of parsley and lemon juice, and isn&#39;t overly minty either. I&#39;m not a big fan of strong mint flavor.
The foul (pronounced &#34;fool&#34;) is what we really go here for. Shawarma Express is one of the only places we&#39;ve ever found in the area that&#39;s got it. It&#39;s a mashed broad bean (fava bean) dish cooked with cumin and big chunks of garlic, and served up in a pool of lemon juice and olive oil. YUM! This stuff is GOOD, especially when eaten with their pita bread (which is also good).

This place is a great choice if you&#39;re looking for some Middle Eastern flair on your taste buds, but don&#39;t want to wait for anything more than fast food. Shawarma Express has been a go-to for us many times, and will continue to be!"

This place is simple and has very good food for a very reasonable price. We have thoroughly enjoyed everything we have ever gotten here. The lamb shank is enough for 2 people. Very tender and flavorful. The baba ganoush is very good. The falafel are big and sometimes hit or miss, usually a hit. Have not had a bad meal here yet.

The only downside is they now charge you for extra sauces as I am not sure why they would. If I just spent $20-$30 if not more, I expect extra sauce for FREE."

Decided to try Shawarma express one day, at it was not good all. The chicken sharwama was bland, only chicken and slightly mayo in a tortilla wrap. The beef sharwama was bad also, All my bites were beef fat, and not chewable. For real, I still think Naf Naf &amp; Pita BBQ are wayyyy better then this. Heck Pita inn down the street is more tastier. Only thing decent at this restaurant is the falafels. I don&#39;t get how people like this joint. I&#39;m not coming back. Not worth it."

This place is impressive: Lentil soup, hummus, and chicken shawarma sandwich were all very tasty. Loved the garlic mayo sauce! This place is worth going to for authentic Middle Eastern food.

Seems like the space is a little too big for them though. Loved the way the upstairs is decorated it would be perfect for an intimate, unique wedding with the separate bar and pool tables etc. Food was okay, a grilled chicken sandwich on a lettuce bun so nothing I can really rate on there, it came with sweet potato fries that were delish. We did get the warm pretzels for an app that I would get again, they&#39;re just like pretzel breadsticks but the dipping sauce that came with was super yummy. 

All in all, good date spot!!!"

Something must&#39;ve changed over time because now it&#39;s a mediocre spot at best. It&#39;s a beautiful restaurant inside with a great beer selection, but that&#39;s about all it has going for it anymore.

They&#39;ve changed their menu and are missing some of our favorite dishes (and what they do have isn&#39;t as good as it used to be)... the service is terribly slow (even on a Monday night with only a few patrons)... and the food portions and beer pours aren&#39;t worth the prices charged.

Overall we may stop in for a beer or two from time to time in the future, but we&#39;ll probably plan on eating somewhere else."

We live in town and tend to eat out regularly so we&#39;ve been to Embers a number of times.  We were initially very excited to see such a beautiful restaurant open in the ruins of Dreams.  

The food is great, the ambiance is really nice but the service is subpar at best.  Tonight our server was actually not awful however she started off with a handicap.  When we walked in there was no hostess and the handful of servers and bartenders who made eye contact with us couldn&#39;t be bothered to even say hello or let us know someone would be right with us.

Please - take these reviews seriously or you won&#39;t be around long.  

Update
Had a great conversation with Michele- the new manager.  She was great and told us that she has been diving into all aspects of the restaurant including reviews on social media.  

We&#39;re looking forward to returning to see how she improves the service."

The place is beautiful and has a good selection of beer. That being said, this place is mediocre at best. The girlfriend and I had the deviled eggs flavored in Sriracha. The red onion and cilantro over powered the Sriracha. We both also had water to start off with and the tap water tasted awful. I got the breakfast burger without the pretzel bun. The only thing that made that burger was the bacon. The secret sauce tasted like mayo and a bit of ketchup. The asparagus was supposed to be roasted and all I tasted was burnt. So I stole some of the girlfriend&#39;s fries and those were bland. Please guys avoid this place. It&#39;s not worth the money."

I love the food options and they have a huge beer selection.  The inside remodel and the multiple levels inside and out on the patio offer plenty of space for seating.

The building once housed Apartments but they burned down several years ago and the building sat vacant for many years. I went to Embers when they opened but could not be seated due to the overcrowded mess that was going on inside. When I finally got around to visiting again, I must say that the food was very well made but the service was lackluster. It seemed as though some servers have their favorites at certain tables and would pay more attention to them instead of keeping a good balance with other customers.

In my opinion for the amount of food you receive, the prices are too high. I feel as though every single thing on the menu should be lowered by at least $3 in order to be compliant with the portion size. Don&#39;t get me wrong it is definitely a cool place to check out and eat at, but only maybe once in awhile."

But the service really leaves something to be desired. We went yesterday to grab a quick drink and an appetizer. We ordered two beers and their nacho appetizer. It took 45 minutes to receive the appetizer. While we were waiting the bar staff could tell we were getting upset and the manager came over and said &#34;Welcome to Ember&#39;s where the food takes a minute&#34;. Now I really don&#39;t think that is something the manager should be saying to the customer, even if it&#39;s the truth.

Also, one of the draft lines was extremely flat and I asked for another beer. It was a $9 beer. The bartender kept it on my tab until I asked about it, which took about ten minutes because the bartenders are never looking up at the people at the bar. 

The place needs better service all around and bartenders that pay more attention to the patrons. Every time I come here it&#39;s like I&#39;m fighting to grab a beer. I&#39;m in a Lockport bar, not downtown Chicago. It shouldn&#39;t be that hard."
embers-tap-house-lockport,Brian S.,KreYAgjOtXlJAX9r6jJFIA,"Lockport, IL",0,1,0,4,1,xWR4GKIxVCpHI_DdKeKhjA,1.0,2016-08-08,"This establishment has potential..... Unfortunately, not under the current ownership! These owners have no clue how to run a business, so they hired an East coast chef and gave him full reign over the menu. But let&#39;s rewind first.....

The building is a former motel/crack-house with a successful bar on the lower lever. To no ones surprise, the motel went up in flames, badly damaging the bar with it. Hence the name &#34;Embers&#34;, as if it rose from the ashes or something.
They did a great job of reconstructing the building, utilizing all three levels and adding a small deck off the back, which overlooks an alley with a tangled mess of power lines and a set of train tracks. This is by no means a &#34;roof top patio&#34; as their website claims. The 2nd floor has an additional full bar, a pool table &amp; enough space to do just about anything... but they don&#39;t do anything with it. If they had bands &amp; DJ&#39;s every weekend, this place would be &#34;THE PLACE&#34; in downtown Lockport. It&#39;s almost as if the owners don&#39;t want customers at all, so the top levels remain mostly unused, which is a total shame.

Their menu is their biggest downfall though. Let&#39;s start off with their burger menu since that&#39;s apparently what they&#39;re known for. First off..... Why on earth would anyone need a burger menu of preset burgers? Why can&#39;t you just say, &#34;We make burgers. Here&#39;s the list of add-ons&#34; Done!
Nope..... their chef  has to create all these culinary disasters served on those awful pretzel buns and topped off with stupid things like vanilla bean BBQ sauce, &#34;Embers Sauce&#34; and &#34;Secret Sauce&#34;!
Wait, WHAT???
What the hell is &#34;Embers Sauce&#34; and &#34;Secret Sauce&#34;? I&#39;m not eating anything that you can&#39;t even tell me what&#39;s in it. When will chef&#39;s get a clue that if I want any type of sauce on my burger, I&#39;ll add it on myself and by the way it&#39;s called ketchup, mustard or A-1 steak sauce.
Oh, and their menu says, &#34;Our burgers are cooked medium-well &amp; are juicy, no need to request a temperature&#34;. Yet another way the let the chef make his own rules.
As for the rest of the menu, you can expect each and every entr√©e to be toped off with something that doesn&#39;t belong on it, such as mushroom gravy, dijon aioli and grain mustard.

As for the service.....
It&#39;s as bad as the rest of the reviews say. We overheard our server have to re-ask a table next to us what they ordered because, as she explained to them, &#34;Last night was my birthday and I&#39;m still a little hungover.&#34; So my girlfriend knew right away that she was going to screw up our order. I ordered the Classic burger without the mystery &#34;Embers Sauce&#34; and my girlfriend ordered the Breakfast Burger. Just as my girlfriend predicted, she gave us both the Classic Burger &amp; blamed it on the kitchen, even though she didn&#39;t write our order down at all. Fifteen minutes later her Breakfast Burger arrives.

I&#39;m not a beer snob, so I&#39;m not going to give a review on that but I do know that $4 for a 16oz can of PBR is way overpriced.
Do the owners a favor and let them know what you think of this place. Maybe they&#39;ll fire the chef and just stick to good old American food without the fancy crap.
For now, if you want a good burger..... go to Burger King."

Btw, it&#39;s a  Sunday @ 6pm.

Currently a limited menu, but what I had was tasty, albeit a bit overpriced for what it was.  Currently, it&#39;s just bar food but I&#39;ve heard they plan to expand the menu.

The decor is welcoming, but the music is a bit loud (it&#39;s possible we were just under a speaker). Loud music generally makes people talk louder, hence the profane drunk at the bar."

My husband and I both ordered the El Cubano sandwich which was very tasty. They have a good beer selection but for some reason everything was served in plastic cups which was very disappointing, especially since you&#39;re expecting a 16oz draft (as the menu suggests) and paying upwards of $6 per beer.

Walking in I have to say its a pretty cool setup. They have a great bar and the just a nice warm vibe to the restaurant just walking in.

We didn&#39;t go to deep on the menu as far as eating but being that we are vegatarian i have to say they had some great options. But had to give it a start with the Bavarian Pretzels ... I would recommend them simple but fresh and so good.

They have a great beer list of tap and bottled that consist of many great options.

For my lunch I had the Falafel sandwich was so tasty. I would highly recommend it and the sweet potato fries that came as the side were amazing.

Everyone in our party enjoyed the food they had (burgers, Falafel&#39;s and salad).  I would definitely come back and have to say was not expecting a great spot like Ember&#39;s Tap House.

We ended up asking to split the check in a variety of odd ways (which I know can be annoying for a large group) and he was happy to help us out. 
The beer list is extensive and the beer drinkers in our party were happy to have a variety of options. Some of us drank wine and we also had quite a few options, which we liked.
The appetizers came out quickly. I tried the Margherita flatbread and it was great to snack on. The chipotle chicken and bacon sandwich was well made. The chipotle sauce, that was served on the side, was spicy and added a much needed kick to an average tasting sandwich. Although I did not try it, my friends were raving about their Mac n cheese.
All in all, a great experience at Embers and a new reason to come out to Lockport."

I like this place, and I&#39;m glad to have it in town. Anything new and clean is a welcome addition in my book. But, the food here is fine but very standard. Think Applebee&#39;s. Some things are pretty good (burger, salad), most things are ok (chicken sandwich), a few things are bad (salmon, crab cakes). The beer list is extensive, but a little bit unimaginative. In their list of 42 drafts I usually only find a couple that are interesting to me. The service is always friendly, but often a bit slow and disorganized. 

The environment is very nice and new, but not exactly &#34;cool&#34;. It&#39;s super brightly lit, which is weird at night. There&#39;s TVs everywhere. And it features that classiest of Illinois restaurant traditions, video slot machines in the hallway. I&#39;d love if this place had ended up being more of a gastropub, but its more like a glorified sports bar. That&#39;s fine, but it seems like we have a lot of places like that around here, and not many going for a more unique vibe.

If they suddenly came to me and said &#34;Hey, you know nothing about the restaurant business, what do you think?&#34;, my advice would be:

-Dim the lights a little bit, it&#39;s not a chem lab.
-Hire a veteran to manage and train staff, get the customer experience down to a science.
-Be more adventurous and inventive with the menu. There are a million places people can get generic burgers and chicken sandwiches and cheap steak around this area. There are very few doing more unique offerings. If you want to draw more than an initial local novelty crowd and become a destination that people come to to eat, you&#39;ll have to branch out beyond the American grill 101 fare.

All that said, this is pretty easily the most modern, &#34;hip&#34; place in town. It&#39;s good to have a restaurant that is trying to modernize the local scene a bit. If they can elevate their food a few notches, it&#39;d be excellent. If nothing else, there&#39;s plenty of room and plenty of beers, so come in for a drink."

Hubby had the black and blue burger which was delicious, I didn&#39;t give this place 5-stars because I didn&#39;t care for my entree. I ordered the flatbread and it was made with an odd, thick, dry, crust. :(.  So hit this place up- just skip the flatbread pizza."

The building facade is welcoming and professional as is the nicely finished interior. While the decor is minimal with haphazardly placed cheap-looking beer signs, the real attraction are the high quality flat screen televisions that adorn just about every possible spot that one might have been hung. Great for Sunday football or any sport watching. Perhaps a bit of identity crisis though... I get it, I visited on a Sunday so not missing the game was a bonus, but my attention should have been captivated by their extensive beer list and food. A great gastropub can survive without any TVs.  

The beer list was extensive and had a nice variety. The ability to order flights is awesome. The beer was served in varying sizes and types of glasses, but as best as I could tell, the glass was determined by the cost/ABV of the beer not the type of glass that the beer should be served in per se. I give Embers 3 stars based solely on their decent ambiance, beer list, and the fact that the bar appeared well staffed and clean. 

The food, however, was very sophomoric. We started with pretzel sticks served with cheese sauce and mustard. I expected run-of-the-mill decent pretzel sticks, instead we got was nearly burned, very dry, mini loaves of what barely tasted like a pretzel rather than bread. The mustard seemed to be typical food service stone ground mustard and the cheese was watery with very little taste. We also had the Buffalo Shrimp. Another let down here. The presentation was nice, but it really felt like someone was trying to follow a recipe without much cooking skill. The shrimp were not breaded (which I am glad for), however they tasted boiled then tossed in buffalo sauce. A moment on the grill or in the oven for some caramelization would have resulted in a decent dish. There was some type of aioli on the plate that might have been blue cheese dressing, and so many crumbles of blue cheese on the plate that I am sure that there was more blue cheese than shrimp by weight. A little wasteful, but harmless to the dish I suppose. Lastly, the  toast points were under toasted (not browned at all on the top) and cut so thin lengthwise that they were useless in trying to use to eat the shrimp with. The dish wasn&#39;t horrible, but the best part of it was the blue cheese. After the lackluster appetizers, we shied away from delving too much further into the menu and split a Margarita Flatbread which I will include a photo of (note the 3 tiny slivers of shriveled basil). Ill be brief with this... the flat bread was not great, the cheese was mediocre (including the sprinkled on kraft like grated parmesan), and... well, it was edible but not great. $9 is about $7 too much for the item.

Overall, Embers seems like it would be a great place to go and have drinks on a Friday or Saturday night (which I will try). But, I will eat elsewhere first. Hopefully they get a good chef to improve their menu, or ingredients, or kitchen skills because Embers has great potential I think if they can smooth out the edges."

Service is still under way, but the restaurant is very new, and every time I go, there experience gets better and better. I&#39;ve also heard that they are under new management, so I&#39;m excited to see what the new management can bring. There&#39;s no place like this in Lockport and I think Ember&#39;s is just what Lockport needed. Fun place to go hang out on a Friday or Saturday night, as they usually have live music and pool on the second floor. The beer list is out of this world (my fianc√©&#39;s personal fave is &#34;Not Your Mother&#39;s Root Beer&#34;). I&#39;d suggest trying the wings, buffalo shrimp (which is grilled- not fried!), and Cesar salad. The dressing on the Cesar salad is homemade and absolutely delicious. My fianc√© really enjoyed the burger and chicken sandwich as well. Ember&#39;s is definitely a must try and the new, hip place to be!"

We never got a drink menu and when our waitress came back with one drink menu, for two people to order, she stood there waiting. The sandwiches were caked with their respective sauces. The smoked pulled pork was drowning in orange grease and had so much smoke flavoring I had to rinse the taste out of my mouth in the bathroom because I thought I was going to be sick. 

Overall, it&#39;s beautiful inside and the beer selection is great but the two meals we had need a makeover. I would compare it to an AppleBees with a way better beer selection and better decor. Not impressed."

It really is what Lockport needed in their downtown. They have a great craft beer selection and really good food.  

The New Year&#39;s Eve party was fantastic with great food, music, and bartenders. The Valentine&#39;s Day dinner for  2 was nice as well. Both were very reasonably priced for what was provided.    The weekend brunch is &#39;ok&#39; but not outstanding; but they are still trying to learn what the customer base wants.  

The chef came out to talk to us during brunch, and also towards the end of our Valentine&#39;s dinner.  He was looking for feedback and I appreciate that a lot. 

I just wish they could keep the knowledgeable folks behind the bar.  Seems like for every good person behind the bar, they end up with 2 or 3 bad ones. Not just in the knowledge of the beers but in the way they treat the customers.  Don&#39;t assume that all females want the wine list instead of the beer list; and don&#39;t assume that all women only want to drink cider or light beers."

No pickle, lettuce, onion but the tots were great? 
And $10.00 for a 5 ounce burger is a bit much.
The wings came out with the wrong sauce and 6 wings on a big plate looked silly!

some good beer. As I entered, the hostess &amp; two other girls were engaged in conversation. As I got close to the podium, they all stopped in their tracks, smiled &amp; said
hello! I opted to sit at the bar. Jessica was very nice and welcomed me to the bar. I was given a beer menu &amp; a food menu.  I ordered 
several micro beers and enjoyed them 
noting many were not available elsewhere. The crowd clientele somewhat young. Many were watching the Cubs Sox baseball game
on one of the many screens there. It started getting busy for late afternoon. The place is about a month old so they are still wrking the bugs out. Jessica my bartender approached, ( earlier I noticed how another customer had a problem with the food order &amp; she offered the customer the choice to make it right &amp; eventually took the food order off that persons bill.) She had a plate of food saying the kitchen had made an incorrect order &amp; did I want the item free of charge??!! I said sure!  Never look a gift horse in the mouth. The food was supposed to be Chipotle Chicken w/ cheese &amp; bacon. 
There was no bacon but it was a good sandwich. Nice &amp; spicy on fresh sandwich roll and tater tots on the side. Very happy with the service there! Thanks Jessica for being classy. Hope the other wait staff/ bar tries to emulate that kind of service! Nice place. 40 different craft brew, a decent menu. Gonna bring the wife back. Have some patience Lockport, this place will sort itself out &amp; has a good chance to be a 5 star place over time. Worth ur trip. Very good service!"

Talk about taking away all the flavor! I was open minded to the change and ordered it anyway, but barely wanted to eat it. So disappointing. Came here right when it opened, and always sat at the bar. There were servers creepily staring at us from every corner of the building (obviously overstuffed), but that problem was fixed over the months. I&#39;ve never seen this place too busy. I came here on a date once and sat at a table, our service was slow and mediocre. 
Big potential, just waiting on those capable results. They have their beverage director listed as being cicerone certified, but should get AT LEAST the whole bar staff up to par, just saying. It&#39;s embarrassing to serve such great beers and no bartender to describe them."

I&#39;ve been in about 6 times since they opened, from myself to 1 other to a large party of 10. Man was it embarrassing suggesting this place, calling for a reservation, waiting for 45 minutes after reservation time all to have the WORST service I&#39;ve ever encountered. I&#39;m a former server/bartender and I know I can be difficult to serve but oh man. Server would come and fill 2 people&#39;s drinks when the entire table had empty drinks, never came to check on us after the food was brought. I physically had to get up 2 different times once to ask for extra napkins (seriously) the second to tell her the entire table needed drinks, not just 2 people. We sat and waited for our check for 35 minutes while we watched out server sit at a table and roll silverware. After watching for so long I got up for a 3rd time to ask for our check. It wouldn&#39;t have been so bad had the staff actually paid attention. I was going to call and speak to management to offer my services for training their staff. This staff needs major help then Embers would be the biggest hit in this town. Definitely."

We visited on opening day during Canal Days in Lockport.    We had a party of 2 adults and 3 children.  There were no issues with bringing in the kids as there is room for them to spread out, and it doesn&#39;t have that typical bar feel.

Food and Service - There was a limited menu for opening day.   The service was prompt, beers were nice and cold and the food came out hot and awesome!  Our very pleasant server knew a lot about the beers on tap and she helped my wife and I select a couple that we had not heard of.  With ~40+ beers on tap, there is a flavor for everyone.  No doubt, she hit the nail on the head in selections.  We tried the pretzels, wings (hot) and the cheese burger.  Pretzels are loaf-like with ground mustard and a homemade cheese-beer sauce for dipping.  Perfect starter.  The wings were grilled, not deep fried, and had a nice light smoke to them.  Sauce had a nice slow heat and not overbearing.  The cheeseburger was fresh.  I am not talking out of the freezer, defrosted, recently ground meat.  You know when you get a burger that was frozen and ask for it well-done (my wife likes it well) - it comes out dry and &#34;hockey-puckish&#34;.  This was not the case, and was the most moist, well-done burger we have had from anywhere.  The toppings of Embers sauce and homemade pickle were perfect additions, adding to the overall satisfaction of an entirely fresh cheeseburger experience (yes, experience).
We had a chance to speak to the manager about the food and he mentioned that all food is made fresh, except the tater tots.  

Decor - Embers felt warm (no pun intended), inviting and modern.  A very spacious first floor full of flat screens (possibly around 20 or more) to catch any game.  The bar size felt perfect and not taking up the entire place.  Bathrooms are located here.
The second floor had another bar, separate room for billiards and another room open for tables and entertainment.  The sliding divider doors make it perfect to host private parties.  Bathrooms are located here, too.
There is a third floor with catwalks over the second for additional seating.  Did not get to head up to that level, so not sure about bathrooms.

There was mention of an possible elevator for handicap accessibility.  

Patio - The size should fit about 30+ people comfortably.  It overlooks the canal and landscaping around.

We&#39;ll be coming back to Embers regularly!"

Positives are the food is very good but a tad pricey.  Lots of people I know have eaten dinner there with good reviews.  I have only got appetizers but all were good.  Good beer selection but you have to ask to see the beer menu.

Negatives are staff and customer service.  They have some bad bartenders and wait staff but a few are really good.  Most lack customer service training and are not overly friendly.  I HATE when you sit down at a bar and none of the 4 bartenders recognize someone just sat down in those 2 stools that have been empty for the past hour.  I&#39;m not 100% sure but it seems the bartenders divide up the bar into quarters and each one gets their own section instead of all bartenders taking care of everyone and splitting the tips.  They also monitor the drink tickets spitting out from the waitresses more than making any eye contact with empty glass patrons at the bar.  I sat there watching each of the four bartenders do everything but look around to see if anyone needed a drink so I waited for 10 minutes before almost grabbing one walking by who then seemed surprised no one helped me yet.

Then upstairs they have a nice open area with pool tables and dueling pianos on Saturday nights.  I have seen them perform couple times now.  They were very bad performers and neither guy could sing at all.  No waitress for the entire upstairs room so you have to stand in line at the small bar and the selection is limited upstairs.  Last Saturday they had a small private party before the pianos started. There were very few tables and chairs set up but did have an open side room full of them.  One off duty owner or bartender saw us looking for somewhere to sit and pointed us to the closet and told us to grab some chairs.  We finally settled into 2 chairs up in the loft.  I then kicked and spilled our drinks we had to set on the floor cause no tables were out.  We watched group after group come up to the loft looking for a table only to walk back down.  Those people would have sat and stayed if there was anyplace to sit.  

My last issue is there are plenty of TVs but no marketing is given to sports.  I was there waiting for Blackhawks game to start and no one ever put the game on until patrons asked bartenders too.  Management should advertise to come watch the games and enjoy some drink or food specials.  They could draw a much steadier sports crowd if they put forth a little effort.

Place is nice and they spent some big cash on the remodel but they need some new management and or staff training.  They are losing money by not going that extra mile.  Advertise the games and set up tables and chairs!  No one wants to stand for 3 hours watching the band!"

Beet salad was decent but I expected more for $13. The regular burger was only slightly bigger than a fast food burger. It&#39;s probably a good place to watch a game but you can get better food at Chili&#39;s.

FB said doors opened at 7, piano&#39;s started at 8, another website said 6:00 and piano&#39;s at 7. We showed at 7pm and there was already no seating for pianos so we waited the 40 min. for a table to be seated for dinner. The entire 40 min we stood waiting there were 2 empty tables that seated 4 (we had 4 in our group).....AFTER we were seated people were sat at those tables so that was a bit frustrating. Our waitress was not on her game that night. We ordered our drinks &amp; she disappeared for a while. About 15 min. later our drinks came, she did appologize that the bar was crowded. We did have a mule, 2 martini&#39;s and a beer. She came back about 10 min. later (after dropping off our drinks) to take our order. My husband ordered 1 more beer. That never came. Our food came, he was sharing my water with me at this point as he had nothing to drink. We asked her a 2nd time, I gave up on a martini &#39;cause I didn&#39;t want to wait another 15 min. so asked for the same beer he was drinking. Our friends wife ordered another cosmo. 10 min. later 2 beers and a martini (NOT a cosmo) came. The waitress just sat the drinks &amp; left. Our friends wife settled for drinking it because she knew she&#39;d never get the one she wanted. The food was excellent and the place was very clean and inviting. I won&#39;t let 1 bad experience ruin the place for us (though it was our 1st time there)....if we go back it&#39;ll be mid week and for lunch because they clearly were not prepared (bar or wait staff) for the crowd they had that night."

It has a room upstairs from the dining room where there are pool tables and darts and a dance floor. However, the crowd is not a dancing type of crowd so this is not the place for girls night out. 

The bar that you walk into has a large amount of seating around the bar and an after hours menu with pulled pork nachos that will make you feel like you&#39;ve entered the happiest place on earth. The only down side of this place is the kitchen closes really early on most nights, we went at 9 on a Tuesday and the kitchen had already been closed but the Hawks were still in the 1st period. They did have the after hours menu where we discovered the nachos, so just a warning. 

It&#39;s got a great room to host a party if you so choose and the manager has always come out to greet us whenever we have gone which is sweet."

I would just replace all of management and do a FAST retraining of the current staff.  If that doesn&#39;t work then clean house on the staff.

The food is pretty bad also considering it is really just burgers.  All burgers come out well done no mater how you order it.  Medium rare come out with maybe a touch of pink.  Don&#39;t waste your time sending it back because it comes back pretty much the same as the first time.

Beer selection is at best average.

At least it had flavor. Burger was tiny and only had 1/2 piece of bacon on it. Again, not a value at all for $10.

The service!! We were there on a Saturday night to grab a quick bite and it was packed. We were able to find a spot at the bar since the hostess said it would be a 45 minute wait (even tho we saw a few empty tables as we walked around the bar). We sat at the bar and realized it was gonna be even longer to order food because there were no bartenders on our side of bar. Lots of people just standing there just waiting to order drinks or food and no bartender to be found. One girl behind the bar with long dark hair in a ponytail walked by with a nice scowl on her face completely ignored the patrons trying to get her attention. After that we decided to give up our seats at the bar and walked out. This was just the latest incident. Don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be giving this place any more chances. The food is ok at best. It&#39;s a nice space. The patio is nice in the summer. But the service is what kills this place. Everyone I know has said the same thing about the service.

I got there shortly after 6pm and the place was already packed.  We got the last table on the first floor, closet to the door. We must have has good timing because ten minutes later there was a rush and there was a 45 minute wait after that.

First impressions:  they did an outstanding job with the decor and everything.  Having been to the old &#34;dreams&#34;, this is night and day difference.  

Food:  there was a total of three of us in my party.  First impressions was it took a long while to get our food.  Two of the three of us got their food first.... The third dish showed up ten minutes later.  It probably took about 30 minutes to get our food in the first place.
  One of my friends ordered the beet salad.  The salad was suppose to come with Goat cheese but came out with blue cheese.  I guess that&#39;s all they had.
  My wife had the breakfast burger with sweet potato fries.  She said the burger was awesome, but the fries were cold.
  I ordered the chipotle chicken with bacon and regular fries.  My meal came out ten minutes after my friends and wife, so my meal was hot.  I enjoyed my meal.

Staff:  our server was heather.  She was very nice and performed her job very well.  She stopped by ever ten minutes to see if I needed another beer or if there is something else she can do for us.

Downside: a lot of kids in the bar area.  The table behind us had 6 kids and none were over the age of 5.  Parents were all sitting at a different table.  My friend and wife mentioned that it was a bit loud, but overall it&#39;s a nice place."

We started with the Brussels sprouts and they were excellent. We had the Breakfast burger, the black and blue, the Lockport Legend and the loaded nachos.  Everyone was very satisfied and though a bit pricey, we will definitely go back. The nachos would have fed at least 3 people and were seasoned beautifully (we chose chorizo)...just enough kick.

They have 40+ craft beers on tap and I can honestly say that I haven&#39;t ever had a beer that has an off flavor or stale taste due to dirty lines like I have frequently had at other local craft beer establishments.  Always fresh tasting beer! This area has no shortage of bars with craft beer, but none have the selection or quality that Embers has! As a craft beer enthusiast, I am thoroughly impressed every time I come here! Christy, Anolda and the rest of the staff on this particular night have truly knocked it out of the park!

My husband, my 14 month old son and I went to Embers tonight for our Christmas Eve dinner. We had been planning to go there after church because we love the food and is kid friendly. I was told that they were open until 5 and we got there right at 4. The nice hostess sat us down and we were just about ready to order when she came back and told us that the kitchen decided to close since they were basically empty. The poor girl clearly wasn&#39;t informed by the kitchen staff or she would have never sat us. My husband and I were pretty irritated because why advertise that you will be open until 5, if you plan on closing the kitchen. This was a terrible management decision and will definitely impact whether we choose to come back or not. We drove 20 minutes to come here and were sent away to find something else. Like I said, the food is decent but you should never advertise something and then change the plans because you aren&#39;t busy. Inconsiderate. I hope other people didn&#39;t show up, just to be told to leave."

Lots of beer selections and when I asked about one the waitress explained and offered me a sample. I have been to several trap houses and microbrew places and the beer selection was quite nice with many to pick from.  I had the pressed coffee and it was really outstanding.  Did not see it on the menu but would get it again for sure.

The hostess asked how many, and when we said 2, she explained that the kitchen was really backed up so ordered were taking a little longer than usual to come out, so she would seat us in a little bit. Huh? There were at least 5 open tables in my view, not to mention the bar was only half occupied. I understand it&#39;s busy, but as long as we&#39;re okay with the extra wait for food, I&#39;m not quite sure why that means we can&#39;t be seated when there are open tables. We told her we would just sit at the bar. It took a good 5 minutes for someone to take our drink order, and then we had to ask for food menus. The TVs were showing a presidential interview instead of football or a football pre game show. My dish came out a good 10-15 minutes before my boyfriend&#39;s - what he originally ordered wasn&#39;t available so he had to order something else. Instead of waiting to make mine or making his immediately so it could come out together, the kitchen clearly made his in the order it was received, which means the bartender didn&#39;t tell them to make it with mine or they just didn&#39;t care. 
The drinks were good - they had a very good list of beers available, as well as ciders. 
The food was good - I had the Mac n cheese with pulled pork and my boyfriend had the breakfast burger. 
The bartenders were fun and friendly - when they weren&#39;t running around like crazy. 

I&#39;ve worked as a waitress at a new bar/restaurant before and understand it takes a bit to get your stuff together. I just hope they do before it&#39;s too late and they start losing their customer base and go under. We&#39;ll go back to see if they&#39;ve gotten their act together. For their sake, I hope they do, since they carry one of my favorite beers that I&#39;ve only ever seen one other place before."

First thing I noticed was that on a Saturday at noon,  there was plenty of street parking on Archer ave in front of the place.  When you walk in the door, you notice its a nice wide open floor plan with an industrial feel. The room gets plenty of natural light from the large bank of windows across the entire front of the building. I didn&#39;t get to check out the second floor rear patio but hear its nice.  I really liked the atmosphere and the large selection of Craft beers on tap.  I will say all the food and drinks were outstanding and not your average bar fare.  We really enjoyed the Vanilla Bean Porter Wings, the Brussel Sprouts and the Breakfast Burger. Everything was fresh, hot and original. The only small issue was with the delivery of my food.  I ordered two apps as my meal, and only one came out.  I waited and waited and when I asked, I was told they would be right out.  Turns out the kitchen threw away the ticket and  it arrived after I was already finished. The second issue was I was informed to check my bill,  because each time a family member was there prior, they were overcharged for the beer they selected.  I Checked and found an additional item we had never ordered was mistakenly placed on the bill. I would like to commend the management because they came to the table without being requested and were very friendly and apologetic and removed the never ordered item along with the item that arrived late from our bill.  I will definitely be back soon because of the cold beer, fantastic wings and nice customer service."

The only down side is service can occassionally be slow....they make up for it by being friendly enough. Our favorite special is Taco Tuesday&#39;s: 3 beef tacos for $3.50 with as much beef as they can fit in the tortillas.

Read the reviews and this place had the highest marks in the area so my buddy and I checked it out.  As advertised, the food was quite good.  $6 burger specials on Thursdays.  Crispy fries and a toasted bun!  Can&#39;t stress how nice it is to have a sandwich served on a soft lightly buttered toasted bun.  Great bang for your buck.

Had the mini steak sandwiches. PERFECT! 3 huge marinated steak medallions, I ordered med-med rare. Smothered in melty cheese, grilled onions and the steak was SUPER tender and delicious! I highly recommend them! My friend had the southwest chicken wrap. She loved it so much, she ordered it for the second time ! Next time I&#39;m going to try the Rueben. People brag about the burgers saying &#34;it&#39;s the best burger they&#39;ve ever eaten out&#34; They have one smothered in 2 cheeses, grilled mushrooms and grilled onions. Yum!

On Friday I went with a co-worker for lunch and I was really impressed.  Please don&#39;t let the outside of the place fool you, it&#39;s in a dumpy strip mall with a Dollar General store and doesn&#39;t look like the best place from the outside.  Once inside however, things changed for the better.  The place is clean and nice, nothing fancy, but a pretty decent bar and overall atmosphere.  
The menu has all of the typical foods you would expect in a place like this and that always means I&#39;m ordering a burger.  Unless a place is famous for something in particular, I usually order the burger, because if you can&#39;t make a decent burger I have no hope for the rest of the menu.  I ordered the bacon cheeseburger and it was a huge burger and cooked perfectly.  It also included a bowl of soup and fries. The only complaint about the burger (and it&#39;s very minor) is that the bun wasn&#39;t nearly sturdy enough to hold it all together.  It did have plenty of cheese and bacon and overall I would say it was an awesome burger! The prices are great here too and the service was solid all the way around.  I will be coming back here in the near future and I definitely recommend this place... don&#39;t let the outside fool you."

Atmosphere: Bright and fun. There were several televisions, gambling machines, and karaoke. The space was well-lit (especially for a bar with no windows). It seemed like a place for locals to have a drink after work with friends and then to sometimes get an easy dinner. You could easily hold a conversation. These are the reasons why our friend chose Poor Boy&#39;s for his birthday celebration.

Service: The service was decent. Our server had a friendly, familial disposition and broke up our checks. There were times when we wanted something and we had to wait a long time.

Food: We were part of a large group and nobody really LIKED their food. Mostly it was okay; however, there was a soup that was universally disliked. M also disliked her sandwich. I think one person liked the fried pickles due to the fact that she asked for a box to bring home everyone else&#39;s pickle orders.

Drinks: The beer selection was kind of limited. They had very common drinks circa 2000. Think standard macrobrew beer and overly sweet cocktails made with brightly colored pucker.

Poor Boy&#39;s was over an hour drive for me and it&#39;s unlikely that I would ever return. Maybe it&#39;d be my joint if I lived closer and all of my friends liked to go; however, that&#39;s not the case and I&#39;ve definitely experiencced better."

The service was great and the waitress was very attentive. The food was okay. The burger was good but not great. I was a little disappointed that the cheese on my burger wasn&#39;t fully melted. It looked like someone just slabbed a slice of cheese on there. The fries were awesome though and I&#39;m not much of a fries eater either.

The patty itself was good but the grilled rye was very dry and hard. The fries were not that great either. The soup was basically like hot water and mushrooms.

It took a really long time for the food to get to us as well, even though it wasn&#39;t that busy in there. The server was really nice though.

Overall ok experience but I probably wouldn&#39;t go back... =/

Update:
Turns out I did go back because my manager wanted to go, haha.

This time, I got the special Reuben with fries and chicken noodle soup. The soup was not bad. The Reuben was OK but the bread was completely burnt... you could see the whole crust was black... and the fries were too crispy... and my lemonade was watered down.

The location is in a nondescript strip mall, with some shuttered stores; so the name fits the overall vibe of the place.
Plenty of flat screens on the wall and Sox fans all around.

We have been here twice for lunch and each time the food was avg at best and service somewhat spotty.  

Not sure of any other local dives in the area, where you can grab a sandwich and a beer whiling watching a ball game and not be surrounded by Corp logos and trinkets of a national chain."

Now think of the theme song.

What&#39;s that line?

Ah yes... &#34;...where everybody knows your name...&#34;

Oh yeah, everybody here knows each others names. Seriously, A LOT of regulars at this bar. It&#39;s good to see that a business has such good customer retention. What&#39;s even better is that a non-regular like me gets the same great service as the guys that are there ALL THE TIME.

In addition to great service, they have great burgers. Nothing goes better with a few 25oz mugs of beer than a big greasy cheeseburger with fries. Well, now that I think of it, I did have quite a few of those frosty 25oz mugs of beer because they were super cheap. So, maybe the combination of hunger and mass amounts of beer may affected my perception of the actual deliciousness of said burger.

Anyway, I&#39;m A-Ok with Poor Boy&#39;s. It&#39;s a regular bar, maybe leaning towards a dive bar, with a few plasmas for viewing some television networks of the sports kind, and FREE popcorn. Yep, freshly popped popcorn from their popcorn machine compliments of the house. The regulars seemed pretty friendly, and the staff was super friendly. Great service and cheap drinks will always win me over.

If you find yourself out in the sticks and near Poor Boy&#39;s, stop by, get drunk, and eat a burger. It&#39;s good if you&#39;re nearby, but it&#39;s not worth making the trek from anything further than 15min away.

Went with a couple of friends here for a Wednesday night dinner. First off this bar is kind of a dive. Had I not heard good reviews I wouldn&#39;t have even gone in. It is hidden in a strip mall next to a dollar general. Not much curb apeal here. When you go inside though it is a nice sports bar atmosphere. Although I will say I got many looks when I walked in the door. Yes I get it I don&#39;t normally come here but please people (Patrons not the staff) don&#39;t give me a look like you never say a gay guy before. We went during the hawks game and I get it is a bar but it is very loud here also. If you want to talk with your friends it is very hard to hear them here. Once again though it is a bar so I can&#39;t say this wasn&#39;t expected... The service here was pretty good and friendly. We all ordered cokes and they left a pitcher so we didn&#39;t have to wait for refills. For dinner we started with the cheese stix. They were good but just the normal ones you can get at any other restaurant. I was going to go with the cheese fries but I was told by the waitress they use a cheese sauce instead of melted cheese so I passed on those. I had the Cheese burger for dinner. The burger here is a nice size and was cooked well. You can tell the burgers are home made also. They aren&#39;t frozen and are good quality. Over all I thought the food was pretty good here I would go back.

I was surprised to learn the restaurant has been there for years.....we are in the area all the time, did not know it existed. It is in a partially vacant strip mall, easy to miss. I had the Santa Fe Chicken Sandwich, my husband ordered a Pork Tenderloin Sandwich. Both were very large portions, came with fries and soup. We both enjoyed our sandwiches.

We were doing work in Bolingbrook and made the 20 minute drive for our reservation at 7. The restaurant had a decent crowd around this time and has a fancy ambiance. 

It is nice dining on a company dollar so we ordered from their extensive wine menu. We had oysters and scallops to start. Both worth getting. The filet was phenomenal with the veal reduction. 

Desserts were all beautifully presented and decadent.

The service was wonderful, the ambiance is a little stuffy, the food has mixed reviews.  One thing I will note is if you have allergies or dislike certain foods, ask the server about what you are going to order.  My husband had mushrooms in his dish (which he doesn&#39;t like) and there were nuts in the dessert, neither of which were listed in the descriptions on the menu.
I started with the salt roasted beets and it was really good.  If you like goat cheese and beets, I definitely recommend it.  For my entree, I ordered the scallops.  The scallops themselves were good and the short rib hash itself was good, but they felt like two separate dishes that didn&#39;t belong together...scallops are too delicate of a flavor to be mixed with short rib, in my opinion.  I liked both parts, just not together, so I ended up just eating the scallops and then taking home the hash to reheat with eggs.  
For dessert, we had the carrot cake bread pudding.  It was decent, not the best, but pretty flavorful.  Per my earlier comment, there were nuts in the carrot cake and we likely wouldn&#39;t have ordered it if we had known (nuts were not listed in the description)."

The food was good, but not amazing. The staff was friendly but a bit slow. The ambience leaned toward the mature, definitely not your trendy, modern restaurant. Would I take my parents or grandparents here? Yes. Would I come here date night? Nope."

The first time was for a large party celebrating two birthdays.  I realize timing a large table is difficult, but for the price you pay it should turn out good if not great.  Both times I was disappointed with my food.  The first time I had risotto and it came out cold.  I would have sent it back if I had been with just my husband, but didn&#39;t want to make a fuss with 10 other members of his family there.
The second time I had a fish that was very poorly prepared.  Bones on one side of the fillet, with all of the seasonings in a glob on the other.
My husbands food was also only average.  
But the drinks were excellent, and they did bring out a candle for the birthdays.  Food wise, I would say two stars, but given the delicious martinis I add one...Three stars!"

I honestly can&#39;t believe I grew up in Naperville and just now am paying them a visit. Thank you Naperville Restaurant Week for the nudge!

Hubbie and I were sat at a great booth next to the wall length window that allows you to see the chefs busy in the kitchen. Although it took way too long for us to initially be greeted, our waitress was super nice and helpful throughout our meal. 

We both ordered off the restaurant week menu which was a great deal. They actually offer a prix fix option on their regular menu too which is good to know for the future. To start, I had the Maine lobster bisque which was amazing. Smooth, creamy, and just the right amount of lobster chunks and sherry whipped cream.

For my main entree I chose the oscar style filet mignon medallions with Maine lobster, b√©arnaise sauce, asparagus, and mashed potatoes. Man oh man! I am still dreaming of this meal. The filet mignon was seriously the best piece of meat I&#39;ve ever had and the lobster on top was perfection. The veggies were also delicious. 

At this point I was getting very full (ate too much of the fresh bread we were given!), but dessert was a must. We had the flourless chocolate cake which had a warm hazelnut center, topped with crushed hazelnuts, and some finished with some sort of raspberry like jam. SO GOOD. The dessert was the perfect size and sweetness.

They were pretty busy on a Friday night, so I&#39;d be sure to make a reservation! Keep in mind they also make a great old fashioned and mojito :)"

This restaurant is a very nice place for a group or a romantic dinner for 2. The decor is more upscale modern rather than nautical. It is dimly lit and the service very good. This time a minor thing with the food runners was that they came to the table a few times with orders that were not for us and clearing dishes was slow meaning they would bring the next course and not pick the up the last ones. We had to ask more than once. 

As for the food it was very good. There is something for everyone both sea foodies and carnivores. We tried the crab cakes which are some of the best you will find. Very little filling which is really the top judgement criteria for me. We also tried the the seafood medley which had shrimp, octopus, calamari and mussels with a divine sauce. Also a very good shrimp cocktail with 5 pieces but not the prawn size. 

For dinner we tried the seabass, swordfish, scallops and the 2 landlubbers had the filet mignon. The Seabass was excellent. The swordfish came lightly blakkened with a shrimp topping. It was good but slightly dry probably from being cooked a minute too long. The scallops were very good. I was told the steaks were good but not steakhouse good. All portions were good sized and came with a side. We also ordered some sides to share of brussels sprouts that were cooked with bacon and wallnuts, which were vey good, and grilled asparagus which was simple and plain grilled. 

The drinks here were good sized and well mixed which justifies the cost. There is also a an ample wine list. Some of our crew enjoyed that. Only a few has desert. The creme br√ªl√©e,  I was told, was very good and the chocolate cake was also. In the end the overall cost for quality and value was ok but not great. However this is a decent place to go for a nice dinner in a very nice setting."

I have to say, I was disappointed. Our server was kind and competent, but it seemed as though she had too many tables. 

Once our meal was delivered, my husband&#39;s water was not refilled, and he had to work to flag down our bustling server. 

The bus man came once we called her attention to it but seemed a little aggressive in his pouring as if he were angry for needing a reminder. Perhaps he too had too many tables to care for. 

Our friend said it seemed like there was no Parmesan in his panko and parm coated fish. My husband asked for, basically, over cooked broccoli. His arrived hard. He asked again to have it prepared softer, and the second dish came out hard again. (This is a preference of his, but also a dietary need.)

Our server was rarely able to check on us. 

So for a bill well over $250 with tip, we had a three star experience. While the company was good, the restaurant was pleasant in its surroundings, the food and service was a disappointment."

Catch 35 would be your go-to place especially if you are in search of good food while on a budget. Twice, I came for their happy hour specials and went home carrying my stomach while doing minimal monetary damage. 

What have I tried and will repeat? The crab bisque is perfect for the cold weather. It&#39;s hearty, creamy, and filled with large bits of crab meat. I would always order the bowl as oppose to the cup. Do the simple math and you will realize the half-price specials make the bowl a perfect deal. Also, be sure to ask for the house bread for dipping! The tuna tartare is comes with an abundance of raw tuna and avocado on top of a crispy tortilla chip. If you want to try more items, be sure to share this one. The beef tenderloin sliders are also perfect for sharing. One plate comes with three sliders stacked with juicy, medium-rare, and sliced beef tenderloin. 

Some other items that I have also tried are the fish and chips, calamari, and crab cake. Great portions and flavors! I would suggest going with a few hungry hippos to wipe every plate clean. Otherwise, taking leftovers to go would also make a good lunch for Monday!"
catch-35-naperville,Amy R.,wu-KCcbj-WgYPAuiVSqzZg,"Naperville, IL",1,1,1,179,76,Y9jaR9hZEWMz08GLiUT6fw,3.0,2015-08-22,"It was Friday night, and my husband and I perused OpenTable for a place we could get a res within the hour. We weren&#39;t overwhelmingly hungry and couldn&#39;t decide on any of our usual spots, when my husband asked if we could check out Catch35. Having seen their billboards constantly on the Eisenhower and driving past the Naperville location bazillions of times, I assumed it was a swank, high priced, high brow establishment that had a fluke res available for 8:00 on a Friday night.

Well, I was partially right.

We arrived and valeted the car because I wasn&#39;t about to battle the Naperville parking crowd. The outside is beautiful, with a modern minimalistic sign and a well kept patio seating area. When we walked in, the bar area looked classy and clean. They showed us to our table and I couldn&#39;t help but notice the place was almost completely empty. It&#39;s also... How do I say this? Horribly ugly. It&#39;s like a 1980s upscale Chinese restaurant smashed together with a cut-rate Morton&#39;s Steakhouse. There are these huge, cheesy, ugly mural-y paintings at the top of the walls, leather dining chairs, a view of a mostly empty refrigerated fish case in front of the kitchen, and an overall American-Psycho-if-American-Psycho-was-filmed-in-the-Midwest-at-a-budget-eatery vibe. It was dated and yet still seemingly trying too hard. I don&#39;t mean to ramble on about the interior but we talked about it through the entire meal, it was so strange.

Our server was excellent and one of two highlights during our visit there. He was funny, charming, well-paced, pressure-free, and helpful. We began with a dozen oysters, a personal favorite of mine ANYWHERE and these were the other highlight of our night. We get oysters nearly everywhere they&#39;re offered on a menu. We get oysters at extraordinarily pricy, trendy, upscale places. And THESE oysters were some of the best I&#39;ve ever had. Served with two mignonettes and a cocktail sauce, over ice, they were incredible. Meaty, substantial, briney, perfect. I would come back and just eat oysters. Such. Amazing. Oysters.

And while their oyster selection was off the charts, you don&#39;t really have to cook them or involve yourself in them past shucking, so while I loved the oysters, we pressed on to the actual menu to sample their fare. This is where I was less impressed. My husband got the fried whitefish which looked and tasted great, but my crab cakes - while earning points for being seemingly 99.999993% crabmeat, were dry. I ate one and left the other for my husband to pick at. They were served with overcooked, mushy vegetables, and sticky, underdone jasmine rice, alongside the most standard remoulade ever. I was not impressed. We didn&#39;t stay for dessert - honestly the interior of the restaurant was so unsettling for me, I didn&#39;t want to. I know, I know. It&#39;s petty. But weird yellow walls with bizarre paintings get to me!

Overall, I would much rather swing over to Hugo&#39;s down the street to get my seafood fix. I would consider coming back just to enjoy another round of incredible oysters - otherwise, Catch35 is really not a place I&#39;d like to be caught by again."

Half off the bar food menu (minus the lobster items).  My wife and I really enjoy the food.  The service varies as their bartenders come and go. 

Get the beet salad, not on the bar menu, but it&#39;s awesome.  Cesar salad with salmon is killer.  I could eat four.  Filet sliders is a serious go to.  Baja shrimp roll is yummy too.  

Seriously, too much to write about.  House wine ran $10.  Umm....no comment.  Nice beer list. No draft beer is a bummer.  
 
Honestly, a great spot for a last minute weeknight &#39;hey, I don&#39;t feel like cooking, let&#39;s go out&#39;

You can grab their specials at the bar on Sundays, Mondays, and Tuesdays. 1/2 off items on the bar food menu. With it being close to Naperville&#39;s awesome free parking, that&#39;s a win, right?

I came with family around 4p, and it looked like we were the first ones there. The waitress was very pleasant, and we put in our orders. Fortunately we came early, because the food took longer than one would expect for bar food. It&#39;s almost as if the kitchen had to turn everything on and wait for it to warm up. It&#39;s a good thing that they serve a delicious bread (free) while you&#39;re waiting.

When we finally got our food, it was about average in terms of taste. There wasn&#39;t anything particularly wrong with anything we ordered (e.g., fish &amp; chips, lobster sliders, fish tacos, etc.), but nothing really stood out either. I would certainly order the lobster roll and fish tacos again, but I would pass on the fish &amp; chips.

So while Catch 35 is conveniently located in downtown Naperville and has a nice space, it&#39;s a bit too dark inside for my liking and the wait for food is longer than expected. For something a bit more upscale, this place is a good option."

I think it appeals to a much older demographic because although nice it was stuffy.  I will say the most redeeming part of lunch were the drinks.  My martini was excellent and my daughter had a delicious Moscow Mule!!  We went for lobster rolls and they were so so.  On a scale of 1-10 I&#39;d give their rolls a 6.  Decent but nothing is come back for.  The lobster meat was ok, just seemed like it was culled from scraps, flavor was ok but bland.  The fries needed work and slaw was decent.  It was a passable lunch but not worth the money.  Service was good.  I&#39;d go back for other menu items, but this was an ordinary experience."

If you&#39;ve ever been to an excellent New York fish bistro, you realize immediately this place pales in comparison, yet charges otherwise. 

You&#39;ll have a decent meal -- one that&#39;s hardly memorable, and possibly not fully satisfying. But enjoy some oysters, have some dessert and hold your nose when you sign the credit card receipt. 

Sometimes a gorgeous, freshly-caught piece of fish, cooked skillfully over some flame or high heat, is all we really want. I&#39;ll skip the lemongrass sauce."

Normally those two hour breaks between Sunday trains are a killer, but in this case it turned out to be fortuitous.

I&#39;ve eaten at Catch 35 in Chicago in the past (long ago past, to tell you the truth), mainly because I worked above it. it had great food &amp; a swank room, but my heart is all about Shaw&#39;s, just across the river. I was also impressed with the room here. I sat at the bar, in the bar, as I was just having a snack. The service was impeccable, and the food was delish: I had the Yellow Fin Tuna Sashimi, which was perfectly prepared, and I loved the sesame seed crust. 

My preference in such a place would be to not have TVs, but we&#39;re in Chicagoland; so I&#39;ll keep my mouth shut. It might steer me away from coming with a special someone.

Yesterday we went and the only acknowledgement we had was from the busboy who quickly brought us their complimentary bowl of seasoned potato chips. A good start but after that, nothing.

We arrived early for our reservation and were accommodated, which was very nice. The place was dead, so it was not a huge feat, but nice, nonetheless. Our waiter was extremely nice; but got our order wrong (specifically how I wanted my lobster cooked), and argued with the staff delivering it in front of us and the staff member verified on the ticket that the waiter had entered it in incorrectly. The lobster was subpar. It was rubbery, and tasted like something you&#39;d get at an outback. Not worth the money. The mashed potatoes were bland and needed salt and pepper to be edible. Very uncharacteristic in fine dining. The asparagus was not crisp. It honestly could have been from a can. I am not fully discounting the food there, because our filet mignon was delicious. The scallop appetizer we ordered and the raspberry chocolate cake they comped because of the special occasion we were celebrating were also both amazing.

We made reservations for 7 on a Thursday night and my it was quite empty, should I be worried I thought? They had a $44 Restaurant Week menu but no $33? Oh wait no, their $33 menu is actually only $27, what a great deal!

We were greeted by an enthused server who let us know that he had a trainee shadowing him, which was no problem for us. I&#39;m thinking great we have a fun server, our experience is going to be good, but boy was I wrong. Once we placed our drinks and food and kindly asked for bread, we were told the bread isn&#39;t brought out until appetizers are, but yet all the other tables around us who clearly still had their menus and were seated after us had breads on their table.. what the? So we kindly asked can we get it beforehand since we were all hungry. 10 minutes, 15 minutes still no bread and no server to be found. We eventually had to ask someone else for it.

Finally drinks and starters began to roll out and our server and trainee magically shows up. Unfortunately for one of our co-workers she was forgotten the whole night, from her starter to her ending coffee. The food was either delivered after everyone else or forgotten entirely. 

Don&#39;t let the slow service fool you, the food is delicious.

I had the shrimp and crab bisque, not too heavy and a good amount of crab meat. A co-worker and I split the grilled atlantic salmon and the Georges Bank Haddock (Blue crab, crispy panko, ginger chili sambal). My oh my, that Georges Bank Haddock he was scrumptious; packed with flavor and crispy crunch from the panko. The blue crab was the icing on topped. YUM! The grilled salmon was a simple grilled salmon you can get just about anywhere, nothing stood out. For dessert I ended up with the pecan pie and vanilla icing. That my dear friend was the Queen of desserts, I was so full but yet I still manage to devour this delectable sweet goodness. 

Overall, the food was done very well and worth the $27 prix fixe, however, the service was so bad it left a bad taste in our mouth at the end."

I sat at the bar for a light dinner on a weekday evening.  I ordered a glass of wine, the scallops, the tuna sashimi and the green beans.  The bartender was attentive and professional, no problems there. But the quality of the seafood was terrible.  My tuna came out a slightly brown color and not only was each piece cut differently, half of them were all hacked up.  And it was the meant-to-be-pink center that was brown.  Truthfully, I should&#39;ve sent it back.  The scallops were tiny, diameter of a quarter and the sauce tasted like something you&#39;d get in a frozen dinner.  The green beans, however, were perfectly cooked and bright green and crunchy.  By the way, none of this was happy hour prices.  While I was leaving I noticed other diners were given bread and butter, maybe if I had gotten some I wouldn&#39;t have had to go home and cook dinner."

We came here for my husbands birthday, and this is the kind of place that is great for a celebratory dinner.  For appetizers, we ordered the calamari and oysters.  Both were amazing and a great way to start the meal.  The calamari were fried to the right amount and had a great crisp to them.  The oysters were also crispy but maintained their soft texture. For the main meal, my husband ordered the George Banks scallop dish, which consists of scallops and short rib hash, sort of like a riff on surf and turf.  The scallops were cooked perfectly and were incredibly juicy.  The hash went well with scallops and were incredibly flavorful; the bold, umami flavors of the hash paired really well with the sweetness and tenderness of the scallops.  I ordered the Chilean sea bass with asian vegetables (i think it was a special).  The sea bass was very tender and meaty, and the asian vegetables were very tasty.   It came in a sauce which was also very good as well.  

The service was very attentive and our waiter was very funny.  The restaurant is dimly lit and has a great ambiance.  I think they were going for an upscale, formal version of a crab shack.  The restaurant feels very formal, but also casual as well.  I saw several diners wearing jeans.

We went on a Wednesday evening and I made reservations on opentable.com.  I had to change my reservations since some friends decided last minute that they would be coming.  The restaurant was very accommodating and changed our reservation easily."

It was pretty busy at 6:30. Nice and dim lit setting (unfortunately, too dim for pics) Huge wine selection. Food was also pretty good. My favorites were the Haddock and the Tuna Poke. The haddock portion was very generous and the tuna poke was delicious. The meal was a little pricier than my normal expenditure but we were celebrating. The chocolate chip bread pudding was AMAZING....we shared amongst 3 people but I wish I had my own. It was hot and everything just melted together deliciously. 

Excellent service! Very attentive throughout the meal. There was a slight mishap where they brought out the wrong appetizer but then quickly provided the right appetizer. It wasn&#39;t a huge deal but the manager took the drinks off the menu b/c of the mix up! I mean i&#39;m not going to say no...ha.

A lot of the stuff on the menu at Catch 35- the halibut, the salmon, the swordfish, which are the ones I have tried so far, are average at best. For instance, the halibut was too firm and the seasoning too salty. The presentation and garnishing are very nice, though, which gives for some photogenic food!

I do have to say, the reason this review even got 3 stars was because of the oysters. Now these are something. Very fresh and a multitude of types. I recommend blue point but try all of them."

My wife and I made a 7:30 reservation this past Friday, November 6, 2015. We arrived a few minutes early and discovered they were seating late. We expected 5-10 minutes... not nearly 40 minutes! We initially chalked this up to simply their host staff who appear to be inexperienced, casually-dressed, high school students who don&#39;t seem to know the first thing about providing quality service or addressing guests concerns at a fine dining establishment. 

Once we were finally seated our waiter didn&#39;t come greet us for another 25 minutes. Now it was nearly a full hour beyond our reservation and all we&#39;d been offered was bread and water. Finally our order was taken and apologies made. Our waiter informed us their credit card processing terminal wasn&#39;t working, there chef had walked off the line earlier that evening and they were understaffed (on a Friday night). 

Food: Unfortunately items that appear on their website, that my wife and I both looked forward to ordering, weren&#39;t listed on their menu. Our Caesar Salad dressing was bland and mostly watery lettuce. The Clam Chowder Soup should&#39;ve been called a Potato Chowder as it completely lacked the main ingredient - Clams. Our entrees finally arrived at 9:05pm - over an hour and a half after our reservation. One problem... our side dish of Brussel Sprouts that we ordered didn&#39;t arrive. Our waiter stopped by to ask how everything was and we informed him we didn&#39;t receive our side. He immediately ordered it but unfortunately, by this point, we&#39;d practically finished our meal. The Brussel Sprouts were delicious... I just wished they&#39;d arrived with our meal. Fortunately we were offered a complimentary desert. Unfortunately the Flourless Chocolate Lava Cake combined too many flavors for my liking but my wife loved their signature Key Lime Pie. 

Service: Our waiter worked extremely hard all night despite being understaffed, having trouble with their credit card processing and mistakes made in the kitchen. However our water was only filled once and we were never asked if we&#39;d ever like another glass of wine. 

We expected so much more quality in regard to their food and much better service."

When I made the reservation I made sure to note that it was his birthday, just like I&#39;ve done at every other restaurant and they always acknowledge his birthday. Not at Catch 35. Matter of fact, the server,  Lauren, barely acknowledged us. We were seated, a minute after the server assistant brought us water and bread, and 5 minutes later Lauren came to greet us and take our drink order. I told her that because we were waiting there so long, we already knew what we wanted to eat and wished to place our order. We did. She brought us the bottle of wine we ordered, poured the first glass and we never saw her again until the server assistants came to retrieve our empty plates. Her absence meant that we poured our own wine every time and ate food that was not properly cooked. (I ordered filet mignon medallions that should&#39;ve been cooked medium, but were medium well and well done). But we never understood why she never checked on us after bringing out our wine, because it was a Tuesday night and the restaurant wasn&#39;t busy. However, because I never hold anything back, I made sure to tell her that the food was okay, but the service not so much. Lauren apologized, asked why, and made it up for the rest of our visit. We ordered one dessert to share, but she brought an additional one on the house. The bill came up to $162, and I tipped her $40. Not because she deserved it, but because Catch 35 only pays her $3.50 per hour, so she needs a good tip to make a living. But she also needs to learn to provide quality service to all of her customers regardless of their race or of what she has going on because $162 feeds a family of 10 at an average restaurant and there&#39;s way better service than what she provided. 
I&#39;m very disappointed and will never return to this restaurant. I recommend going to Morton&#39;s in Naperville instead. Their food is great and service is stellar."

Love their soups and the white chocolate strawberry cheesecake is some of the best cheesecake I ever had. We went because my mom wanted to try their fried haddock but they have taken it off the menu. She enjoyed the whitefish very much as a substitute tho. This was her and my brothers first time but I have dined here a few times. I definitely prefer this location over Chicago and no it&#39;s not because I live closer but I just think the service and food tastes much better. Will dine here again.

I had reserved in advanced and mentioned it was for his birthday.  When we arrived,  no one even acknowledged or had an idea that we were there for a special occasion.  

We went on a Saturday night at 7. They sat us at the most ridiculous spot. There was a table set for 8 people and we were next to them and another couple on our other side.  We felt like we were sitting on top of each other.  Tables were extremely close and every time servers went by us they bumped into my husband.  It was ridiculous.  

Servers kept mixing up the orders they served us with what the couple next to us had ordered then they mixed up their order with the couple that were next to this couple. I could tell other couples seated next to us were getting frustrated as well. I felt so unconfirmed and wanted to get out of this restaurant.  I had to remind the server that it was my husband&#39;s birthday.  

Food was ok,  nothing special.  We ordered fried oysters, which was good but lacking in quantity.  My husband ordered mahi mahi, which was ok. I ordered the swordfish, which was bland.  The desert was complimentary. Bread pudding was also ok,  nothing great.

Called to see when the lunch menu ended. Was told 4:00pm. Arrived at 3:45. Waited 5 minutes for the hostess to acknowledge and seat us. She was somewhere out of sight behind the hostess stand on her cell phone. Were given lunch menus. Ordered sangria. Once it arrived we ordered lunch. At 4:03 the server returned to tell us &#34;Chef&#34; had already turned the menu over and we couldn&#39;t get what we ordered. When we balked at that she said she would ask &#34;Chef&#34; if we could have lunch. Our bisque appeared before we had an answer so we sent the nice young man who delivered our soup to find our server. She came back and said we could have what we ordered except the chopped salad had already been thrown out for the day. When we asked if we would be receiving lunch prices and portions, she paused and again needed to ask &#34;Chef&#34;. Is the chef also the manager? She eventually came back and said we would receive lunch prices but I had to pick a different salad. The bisque, beet salad, buffalo shrimp and tuna poke were good. Not exceptional but good. The lobster roll seriously lacked lobster for $25. In reviewing the menus, the only thing I can see that even had a price/portion difference at dinner was the tuna poke, which she could have told us. I&#39;m thinking she didn&#39;t know. The bread was warm but slightly stale. Our water glasses were not once refilled. The restaurant maybe had two other tables occupied. This was not the caliber experience I expected from this restaurant or any other $90 lunch for 2. I will not likely be back. I had high hopes. My expectations were not met. The experience was night and day from the one I had two days earlier at Duck Duck Goat in Chicago. They could learn a few things about service from that or any other restaurant in that group.

Crab bisque was creamy, nice crab meat, and seasoned just right. The oyster was juicy and fresh. My lobster roll was made of cold lobster chucks with celery in a grilled, crunchy bread. I could really taste the fresh delicious lobster meat. Loved it. Fish taco was lightly grilled with thin sliced Napa which was awesome and unique. Chocolate cake was actually kind of Volcano or souffle type. It came in cylinder shape with warm chocolate inside. Absolutely heavenly.

Once we were seated, our waiter did not come ask for drink orders for at least 20 minutes. My dad and I both got wine, when we received our wine, the waiter did not pour it at the table and the wine glasses were a mess with wine. That to me was quite unprofessional, since they are making a great deal of profits off the wine we were drinking. We ignored it and moved on to our meal. We had crab cakes for our appetizer, which were actually quite delicious! The peppers that come with it were superb. For dinner I had the salmon crusted with brown sugar and cayenne pepper, it was nice and crispy but the portion size was crazy big! It came with rice and some veggies so the meal was quite good. The salmon was cooked well and quite crispy and delicious. The rub was savory and well prepared. I was pleased with my salmon overall. We also shared the blue cheese mashed potatoes as a table and those were fantastic. They were perfectly creamy and scrumptious! My brother had the shrimp pad Thai, he was quite pleased with it. Again, the portion size was huge! My dad had a steak, which seemed to please him as it was gone very quickly! My mom had the garlic shrimp. She got a great number of shrimp for a meal and they were delicious! Highly recommend that dish, especially if you are just starting to try out seafood.

We got our table right away even though the restaurant was packed on Saturday night. The food took a little long to come out but my Jumbo Maryland style Crab Cakes were excellent.

Our waiter overheard that it was my sister&#39;s birthday and offered her any dessert on the menu for free.

Another time I&#39;ve been there our food took over an hour to come out. However, our waiter made it up to us by bringing out one of every item on the dessert menu and we were able to try all of them!"

This was my very first time. I have passed this place a million times but never thought to go because the way it looks from the outside. We went there on a recommendation and we couldn&#39;t have been happier. For a seafood place the beer selection was very good and you could actually pair your food with a good beer not just order something for the sake of drinking. The food was great and you can tell that it&#39;s fresh and not frozen. I had the surf and turf, calamari, and clam chowder and I ate through being full because it was so good.

I ordered Lake Superior Whitefish and shrimp crab bisque and coconut jasmine rice.  My daughter ordered the classic burger.  We also ordered Bluebay Mussels and shrimp tacos for the other two orders.  We also ordered chopped and Caesar salads.   Everything was fresh and tasty except for the fries.  They were too crunchy for my daughter but that&#39;s OK that fries aren&#39;t their specialty :)  They also give complementary bread but you have to ask.  There was no wait at all on a Saturday 11:30 am. The decor is nice. Seats are very comfortable.  The bathrooms are super nice and clean.  The waitress was very nice and the last time we came the waiter was also very nice and attentive.  Food took a little long to get out last time we were here for dinner but this time the food came out pretty fast.  Prices are good considering it&#39;s a nice seafood steak place.

Restaurant week was going on, and I figured it would be a great way to experience Catch 35. 4 courses for $44 dollars? can&#39;t beat that. Plus they have a regular prie fix menu. 

Parking is super easy. You can valet, but there is a free parking garage right next to the building. I&#39;m always down the free. 

I made reservations for 8:00 and had to wait about 15 mins to be seated. I was a bit irritated but I got over it once I was seated. Plus the staff was very nice and professional about it. The food and service completely overshadowed it. 

Zach was my server. He was so personable and amazing and very attentive. And he was great with the suggestion.

First Course: Tuna Sashimi

It was really really fresh and so good. I was torn on whether i should do the coconut shrimp or the tuna sashimi and i really felt i couldn&#39;t have gone wrong either way. Zach made an excellent suggestion.

Second course: Shrimp and Crab Bisque

Listen. I promise i could eat this everyday. It was sooo good and it had big pieces of crab and shrimp in it. Delectable.

Third Course:  Lobster with asparagus and roasted mashed potatoes

I&#39;m not a big huge lobster person, but i chose it because Zach said he was surprised they put it on the Restaurant Week menu, so i decided to try it. It was soooo tender and delectable and I was said it was gone. The truffle aioli with the asparagus....whew. That truffle aioli is why Beyonce sings. I dipped my asparagus in that, and put it in my mouth, and my mouth exploded. I wanted to put it on everything. and the roasted mashed potatoes were a great complement to the entire plate. Not one morsel of food was left. I would have licked the plate if my mother didn&#39;t raise me better. 

Fourth Course: 

Turtle Cheesecake. It wasn&#39;t even a thought in my mind that i would not have chosen that when i saw it on the dessert menu. It was sooooo rich and mouthwatering. I cleaned that plate too.

Overall. GREAT FOOD. GREAT SERVICE. ZACH was awesome and so was the manager that night. I think he gave me extra attention because I was dining alone, or maybe he does that for all his guests. I DON&#39;T KNOW. All I know is that my restaurant budget on Mint.com will have to increase because I plan on going to Catch 35 at least twice a month if possible."

Only went to this location because their Chicago location was amazing.  Complete 180 with the location in Naperville.  Celebrating a good time with my fiance.  The server greeted us politely and asked if we were ready to order.  We ordered a jumbo shrimp cocktail as an appetizer, a glass of chardonnay, and a surf and turf for our entree.  We did get the drinks quickly which was great.  Unfortunately, the server was no where to be found for 20 minutes.  I had to get up and catch the server to ask where our appetizers were.  He apologized realizing that he had forgot to place the order for our jumbo shrimp.  But after waiting a little over 30 minutes, the entree came out, before the shrimp appetizer.  I understand they can get busy, but being attentive is equally important.  When we did receive the jumbo shrimp, it seemed like normal cocktail shrimp which was completely different from the jumbo black tiger shrimp that was served at the Chicago location.  The manager on duty apologized for the bad service and offered a bread pudding.  At this point I don&#39;t care about free dessert as we had other plans for the evening.  When we did finish our entree, it was another wait game for the server to get our free bread pudding and our check.   This was one of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever had.  The food was decent but the wait and the service was unbearable bad.  At that point it was over an hour   For a fine dining restaurant, this is pathetic."

The first time I tried was a couple weeks ago.  Me and a few buddies headed there on a Sunday since the rolls and bar menu are half price that day.  I&#39;m a sucker for a bargain.  Well apparently since the day before was Valentines Day it was a holiday weekend so they didn&#39;t have a bar menu that day.  Their website doesn&#39;t say anything about excluding deals on &#34;holidays&#34; and it certainly didn&#39;t say anything about excluding them the day after one.  Me and my buddies decided to move on and went to Heaven on 7 down the street, which was good stuff BTW.

So then I decided to give the place one more try.  Me and my buddy went in and I ordered a beer while my buddy was checking out the menu.  He finally figured out what he wanted so I went and ordered the lobster roll and....they were out of lobster.  Damn it!

In conclusion be careful when thinking about coming here as they false advertise, and if you have your heart set on something to eat from here you may want to call ahead and see if they actually have it."

We had our wedding dinner there using the private room and it was fantastic. The staff was extremely accommodating and helped us create a great experience. We also came to this place two other times and every time enjoyed our meals very much.

From the entrees I would especially recommend blackened salmon, whitefish and sea bass. From the appetizers, crab cakes and beef sliders are great. Dessert selection is also quite nice.

Overpriced. Good service, but pretty much the most mediocre seafood for obscene prices. We had a great time, but the food was sub-par at best. Nothing special, which is depressing for how over-inflated the bill was. 
I feel like 90% of the people in there simply wanted to be seen and didn&#39;t care about the price or quality of the food.
I don&#39;t regret going to Catch 35, but Chinn&#39;s 34th St is a much better restaurant in terms of service and quality at less than half the price. 
Ex: My girlfriend and I witnessed the General Manager walk around for more than 10 minutes going table to table looking for the couple that ordered a bottle of wine with their dinner. When she came around to our table (bottle and 2 wine glasses in hand) she looked at both of us up and down, then kept walking. 5 minutes after, she came back and said, with a confused look on her face, &#34;Did you two order the Rombauer Chardonnay?&#34;
Yes, we&#39;re young, but don&#39;t treat us like scum. 
Over-pretentious, place to be seen. 
If you can afford nice food, DO NOT go to Catch 35.
DO NOT GO TO CATCH 35. 
Ridiculously pretentious and judging eyes are merely the tip of the iceberg when it comes to what you should expect at this sad excuse for a seafood restaurant.

Overall the bread was mediocre in my book but made up for it with a very large amount of butter that reminded me of when I spent a weekend in southern Illinois and had home/hand-churned butter with my rolls every night.  The crab and shrimp bisque was very nicely flavored but I generally prefer my bisques a little creamier and with lobster. Oops. Seared tuna sashimi was absolutely delicious, no complaints there. My lobster entree was delightful and came with a garlic aioli which originally seemed like overkill but turned out to be delicious on everything it touched, including the mashed potatoes and asparagus. My friend declared that the steak, which he prefers well done, to be the best well done steak he has ever had, which is impressive to me as I feel that most well done steaks taste largely like cardboard.  The other dish we had was a lemongrass shrimp and scallop dish which was far too salty and not all that delicious. 

Dessert deserves its own paragraph because it was epic. I&#39;m a big dessert girl, so I had to try just everything, which included the pecan pie, apple pie, key lime pie, flourless chocolate cake, and creme br√ªl√©e.  They were alllllll delicious but the stand-outs for me were the pecan pie (a surprise as I normally would not order this), the flourless chocolate cake (which would&#39;ve benefited from some ice cream on the side) and the creme br√ªl√©e (always a winner in my book). The key lime pie was a little too sour."

We went early in the evening so it was still fairly empty. Yet the hostess did the maddening move of seating us right on top of another table, so we were treated to some big-mouth yammering throughout our meal about his mission trip and his church and blahblah. My mom is very quiet, and after I said &#34;I CAN&#39;T HEAR YOU&#34; a couple of times, I think the woman at that table got the drift and told her companion to tone it down, which worked for about five seconds. Sigh. Since we&#39;d already been established at the table it was hard to move, but restaurant staff, let me make this clear: I do not care if the waiter has to walk a few extra steps. If we are paying big bucks to eat with you, patrons do not want to be in the lap of other diners when the restaurant is nearly empty. This is not entitlement, this is logic.

My shrimp and scallops were fine, and the key lime pie was good, though for their &#34;signature&#34; dessert it was not outstanding. But what was memorable about the meal was the jerk at the next table.

They were extremely busy, so we had to wait a little while, but the staff was incredibly nice and professional about it, and the wonderful food and service quickly erased any inconvenience.

Being the Restaurant Week menu, we got to try a wider variety of food than we normally would.

Round 1, Appetizers: I had the Shrimp Cocktail and my wife the Seared Yellow Fin. The shrimp cocktail was good, but the Yellow Fin was a cut above. It&#39;s hard to find good sushi grade fish in Chicago (especially the suburbs), and this was as good as it gets.

Round 2, Soup/Salad: I had the Cajun Seafood Chowder, she tried the Crab and Shrimp Bisque. Honestly, both were a little underwhelming. They were the low point of the meal (and they weren&#39;t *that* low). Both were seafood soups, but neither had discernible seafood. The flavors were ok, but after eating that spectacular tuna, we expected more.

Round 3, Entree: Here&#39;s where things went from very good to mindblowing. Nicole went with the scallops which came with bacon served over a cauliflower risotto. The scallops were spot on. Not too seared. Not at all rubbery. Incredibly well seasoned. The texture and flavor of the risotto was perfect. The cauliflower was (as you would expect) a subtle flavor which soaked up the delicious bacon smokiness. So freaking good.

However, her entree took a backseat to my spectacular Grouper dish. The grouper was seared nicely for a little bit of texture, but still incredibly moist and flavorful. It came served over an amazing root vegetable hash and duck confit. The rich, fatty duck, earthy root veg, and acidity from the black pepper aioli was perfectly balanced. The mix of textures was also superb. The root vegetables have a density to them which is contrasted by grouper that seems to melt away. Absolutely spot on. One of the best seafood dishes I&#39;ve ever had.

Round 4, Dessert: We brought the night to a close with some very tasty dessert. Nicole had their famous Key Lime Pie, and I had the Bourbon Pecan Pie. I love me some pecan pie, and theirs was very good. The filling was very heavy on the pecan and it came with an out of this world bourbon caramel sauce.

We loved our dinner date at Catch 35 and would highly recommend it to anyone and everyone."

We arrived on a weeknight, (party of two, well dressed) and sans reservation. The hostess paused and acted as though our spontaneity was a problem, so we waited a few minutes; after which we were led through a 1/3-full dining room to a back corner table near the kitchen. It was ten minutes before I was able to flag down a server, who alerted our waiter to our presence. We saw the guy four times from that point on: drink order/food order (at once), one check-in during our meal (after being served twice by the kitchen staff) and lastly, when he arrived with the printed bill--he was correct, we didn&#39;t want dessert. Never during our experience were we approached for our wine glasses to be replenished or water to be refilled.

The food. It&#39;s &#34;Catch 35&#34; so you order fish... Big, white plate. Petite portion of fish. Steamed, unseasoned veggies. A cup of bisque, prior. Am I supposed to be impressed? Even Red Lobster trumps this presentation with their stereotypical parsley garnish. Our fish was cooked properly and tasted fresh, but that&#39;s the only positive I could find (and yes, for a semi-special occasion you hope for the positives!). I&#39;m still trying to find them. 

Atmosphere. High ceilings, dim, quiet, plain and &#34;upscale.&#34; If I can be a bit ugly myself; the designer had an affinity for padded textiles on walls, reminiscent of a Hyatt restaurant. (There, I feel better now.) Add in the pretentiousness of the hostess, the complete void of service and high prices, and you have what is apparently Catch 35 in Naperville, on a weeknight. Enjoy yourselves.

One more thing: look for the obvious shills here on Yelp to counteract the real world experiences people have at Catch 35."

The server also spilled his tray of drinks on the table next to us and it splashed on my feet and legs leaving me sticky, I had to go to the wash room and clean up and he didn&#39;t notice the ice and soda underneath our table. It was just hard to look over the service even with our delicious food."

We were able to be seated right away in the lovely dining room that was comfortably upscale. The waitstaff was terrific - friendly, informative and extremely accommodating to our special requests. GREAT menu and the Yellow Fin sashimi was FANTASTIC!!! Great wine menu as well. I think we found our new favorite local restaurant."

They do &#39;engineer&#39; some of the best seafood dishes around and when you live in the Midwest, expectations for seafood should probably ratchet down a notch, but when you compare the value of a great piece of meat at a first quality steakhouse, versus a great piece-fish at a place like C35, I feel like I really need to be in the mood for seafood and/or come into an unexpected sum of money to justify the experience. 

I was very much in the mood for an authentic lobster roll and I suppose going to C35 for lunch instead of dinner is a way to appease both your sense of taste and your sense of fiscal responsibility!  Cutting to the chase then, the lobster split roll was almost pretzel-like on one side, buttery and crispy outside, soft and chewy inside...which made up for the fact that the lobster itself was very slightly over-cooked and under portioned. We sat at the bar and also had the Siracha Shrimp Roll and the shoestring fries - both items were delectable and suffice it to say we were both pleased and appeased food-wise."

I started with the shrimp cocktail, followed by Catch 35&#39;s exceptional chowder (always a faorite), tuna sashimi for an entree, and turtle cheesecake. The entree tuna was HUGE and came with a side of rice and vegetables. If doing this same menu again in the future, I would choose the tuna aooetizer (much more reasonable portion) and one of the fish entrees. My friends enjoyed the butter-poached lobstr tail as entree selections. 

Our server was Zac and he was fantastic - very engaging and helpful. The only sall complaint I have about this visit is that service was quite slow. Dinner lasted nearly three hours. I have not had this problem in the past and have typically found service to be quite quick at Catch 35."

I think they&#39;re overpriced for what you get. I haven&#39;t been to one in over three years and yet somehow I ended up here for lunch on December 4th.

I was surprised by how &#34;freaky fast&#34; my sandwich was ready. I had no sooner finished putting my debit card away when my order was called out. I had ordered the Vito (#5), which is my standard sandwich the five times I&#39;ve been to Jimmy John&#39;s. 
I always get a side of hot peppers, but forgot this time, I guess being thrown off by my first visit here. I don&#39;t know. Either way, I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t have to wait too long, considering the line was pretty much out the door (and THAT, I don&#39;t understand).

The sandwich itself has not changed in three years. Their bread is weird; I don&#39;t know how to describe it really. It&#39;s definitely not fresh, as the top part is always slightly hard. I received the standard &#34;light&#34; portion of ingredients (and no, I didn&#39;t ask for it that way). It&#39;s just how they do things; use less product but charge more. Without the hot peppers, it was rather bland and forgetable. I noticed the oregano but could not detect the vinegarette. 

It&#39;ll probably be the last time I go, seeing as how I&#39;m not a fan to begin with. Also, this location is a pain in the you-know-what to get to, no matter which way you try."

Coworkers of mine endorsed Jimmy John&#39;s subs as delicious. I suppose they indulged free smells at the downtown Naperville branch because nothing they said matched this particular location at all. Maybe they intended it as a dubious test for the new girl.

Consider the trap sprung and me willing to gnaw my own leg off for freedom, because I sure as hell can&#39;t gnaw this sub for sustenance until my rescue.

I went for a vegan sandwich, a number something or other, with the basic addition of avocado. Pretty simple, right, hard to mess up? Oh, how foolish and naive I was. Stale bread doesn&#39;t reabsorb moisture and freshness with the heavy application of an oil-vinegar goo replacing the mayo I reminded the sandwich artist I didn&#39;t want three times. Yes, three, when there were two people in the store and no cause for distraction. By the third time, I suppose I was getting a bit testy.

Then came the heap of veggies. Wilted veggies that hadn&#39;t been in the ground since Reagan was in office ended up thrown on my sandwich with a careless hand. No razzle dazzle, no hopeful sorting: just a mound of unsorted bits and pieces, the top part teetering precariously like it would stay in place. I gave a hopeful look somehow this culinary balancing act might be fixed, but no, I was given my sadsack sandwich like the Virgin Mary receiving a boatload of Magi presents. Was I supposed to beatifically smile for rotten lettuce and a spot of mold on a miserable tomato slice, the ONE measly slice I got? 

Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t throw it back in his face and start shrieking in tongues, having my one and only Carrie moment. I made a watery smile, paid for the sandwich and poked at it. I couldn&#39;t bring myself to try more than a bite. They stared at me irritably to leave at 1:15 in the afternoon, like they had something better to do, somewhere better to be, someone better to attend on. 

Oh, and forget about napkins or fresh pop. They don&#39;t restock anything after the major lunch crush, and the drink I had was two parts unbubbly soda water, two parts ice, and a scared splash of syrup that masqueraded as Coke. Wow! 

Don&#39;t kid yourself, this is the last outpost of misery before you hit I-88, a refuge for uncaring despair and flippant glares. All I wanted was a sandwich, a simple sandwich with avocado and no mayo. Was that too much to ask? 

Yes, Jimmy John has said, it is. Now let me get back to my annoying motormouth commercial. 

Get to it, because I won&#39;t be coming in again. With any luck, you&#39;ll spare yourself and avoid coming in as well."

I order the sub, pay for it, grab a cup to get a drink, and before I&#39;m even done putting ice in the cup, the sando is ready for me. One time, the sandwich was done before the cashier even handed me the receipt! And yes, the sandwich was made correctly, no mistakes.

The staff here is usually super friendly. I always order &#34;no sprouts&#34;, and they always start shouting out &#34;extra sprouts! make sure that sandwich has extra sprouts!&#34; and I fall for it EVERY. TIME. They are always really amused. I guess it amuses me, too.

Once my sandwich was delivered by a very polite driver, I ran inside excited. (My son was napping, &amp; it&#39;s a real treat for me to get to eat without my son grabbing on my pant legs). I cut the sammy&#39;s in half and started to chow. After eating 1/4 of the sandwich I thought to myself &#34;This veggie sammy is light in veggies&#34;... That&#39;s because it wasn&#39;t the vegetarian. My sandwich had 2 SLICES OF MEAT on the whole thing. SUPER WEAK JIMMY JOHNS! Also this delicious avocado spread everyone speaks of what applied sparingly, so I didn&#39;t get much of a taste.It wasn&#39;t the worst sandwich I have ever had, but I&#39;m super disappointed that there was more cheese than meat on my sandwhich.

While the food is decently tasty and the guacamole is to die for, the service and atmosphere are lacking the most. 

The service: Considering we were the only people in the restaurant (and still are as I write this) on a Saturday night in busy downtown Lemont, I&#39;m starting to understand why. We came into the restaurant with a party of eight people and were seated pretty quickly, however this was the only solace of the entire experience. The waitress (who was nice I might add) asked everyone what they wanted to drink and after everyone had made their requests, she had to go around and repeat everyone&#39;s requests four to five times to make sure she had them correct. Why she couldn&#39;t have just written them down, I&#39;m not sure, but it took another 15 minutes before we received our drinks. Reminder, we are the ONLY ones in the restaurant. Fast forward to ordering, it took over an hour for everyone to receive their meals and while they were dressed nicely on the plates, most of them lacked proper seasoning and were not as hot as they could have been. We all did get free scoops of Vanilla Ice Cream before we left, but even that was over halfway melted by the time we received it.

The atmosphere: It&#39;s very hard to comprehend how this is a Mexican restaurant as the interior is mostly American-looking besides a few Aztec-ian trinkets. Before they decided to turn on some Mexican themed music, they had on Boston, which was fine with me.

Overall our experience here was not the best, I wouldn&#39;t recommend big groups eating here."

The coupon said but one good entry and get the second one for free as long as it was of the same value as the one being paid for.  When I went to pay, she then said the coupon was only if I ate at the resturant.  So they didn&#39;t honor the coupon she said she would when I ordered.

H &amp; H is located in the lower elevation of the picturesque town of Lemont. It occupies a couple of conjoined buildings in a pretty prime location. When I arrived for an early lunch, there was only one other occupied table. As such, I expected to get in and out pretty quickly. After getting my menu, I immediately homed in on the lunch specials, which didn&#39;t seem terribly special with respect to price. Suffice it to say that there are not many bargains to be found on the lunch/dinner menu. My heart sank a little more when I saw the dreaded notice of $10 minimum for credit cards. I started straining my brain with mathematical contortions to find a lunch special plus an appetizer to equal about $10. I don&#39;t think it is possible. Finally, I went with a dinner order of sopes (3) to be served with rice and beans.

Meanwhile, I expected to be greeted with the famous chips and salsa after I received my menu. 

Nope. 

Surely I would get them once I placed a dinner order (perhaps they weren&#39;t offering them with lunch specials). 

Nada. 

Finally, when my food arrived I asked, &#34;Doesn&#39;t this come with chips and salsa?&#34;My server said yes, and a couple of minutes later they showed up. They are just as good as other reviews mention - the salsa was fresh and tasty, but the star of the show was the bowl of homemade chips. They were hot, sort of puffy, and absolutely delicious -- the best chips I&#39;ve had in years.

Sadly, the food took way too long to hit my table after ordering (at least 20 minutes - perhaps as much as 30). This was all the more baffling, considering there were only two tables occupied and the other one was wrapping up their breakfast meal. This clearly is not the place to go if you are in any sort of hurry.

My entree consisted of three beef sopes and rice. The menu promised beans in addition to the rice, but enough time had elapsed that I didn&#39;t want to make a fuss about the discrepancy. The sopes themselves were absolutely fantastic. I destroyed two of them before I knew it - the little masa bowls were filled with a fantastic mixture of beef and refried beans and topped by lettuce and tomato. I could eat these all day long - they were that good. 

The decor appears to be from the 1980s - the booths are upholstered with a pretty homely floral print. I have a hard time visualizing these ever being attractive, but they may appeal to some. The walls are adorned with artwork set into the most ornate wooden frames I&#39;ve ever seen. Not my thing, but taste is subjective.

In summary, the food is top notch, but other things really dragged my rating down. If they could find a way to get food out more quickly, give complimentary chips and salsa without being prompted, and include all elements on the plate, the rating would hop up to a 4. If they also updated the decor, they would get a 5th star. 

It&#39;s a shame that the great food here is not matched by the other elements of the dining experience. They&#39;ve got a chance at something really special here."

No? Just me? Oh...

Well anyway, we were walking around downtown Lemont last night looking for a place to get our grub on. The first place was just a brewery. The second place looked okay but kinda lame bar food. The third was an Italian restaurant that thought way too much about itself and had Stepford girls at the hostess stand that frightened the living crap out of me. 

So when we wandered into your Grandma&#39;s living room at H &amp; H we were delighted. I really wasn&#39;t sure what we&#39;d stumbled into. Was it a museum? Was it a store? Was it ACTUALLY someone&#39;s living room? The decor, yes, is odd. Old. Old and odd. 

That&#39;s when your grandma, a sweet old lady in a smart pants suit with a glittery jacket came out and asked how many of us there were. Had to be a restaurant, right? 

Grandma sat us down and gave us menus and asked what we wanted to drink. Awhile later she toddled back with two giant GIANT glasses of soda/iced tea. And after she took our order she brought us a bowl of homemade tortilla chips that are so fresh they melt in your mouth. I would go back just for the chips. Andres D. was spot on with his review. So amazing. 

I ordered the seafood chimichanga and my wife ordered a Mexican combo plate. Admittedly, the food took a little bit longer than I was hoping. But Grandma was kinda busy because there were two other tables she had to wait on and she&#39;s not as spry as she used to be. Really, that was it. But she was the sweetest, nicest lady you&#39;ll ever meet so you can&#39;t even knock a star away because every time she brought something there was a big smile on her face. 

My chimichanga arrived and it was absolutely bursting with seafood. Crab, shrimp and scallops. And while they were of the frozen variety, they were still cooked well and had a nice tangy sauce that went with them. A smearing of beans, rice, guac and sour cream were also added to my plate as garnish, but the amount of them was so tiny you pretty much got one bite out of each. They, unfortunately, were cold. I think they prepared the plate prior to the chimichanga coming out of the fryer. 

All in all, it was a very pleasant dining experience. A little slower than I liked, but enjoyable nonetheless. And the food was very good. I&#39;d absolutely go back. After all, I might not&#39;ve been able to see MY grandma last night. But it was fun hanging out with yours."

It was so overwhelming on the skirt steak, my mouth started to burn. My girlfriends chicken fajitas were salted just as much, she didn&#39;t even have two bites. No other Mexican flavors on the meats except SALT, everything else was bland. 
The menu said &#34; includes rice, beans and guacamole&#34;. The rice and beans were barely there with maybe half a spoon of each, both bland bland bland...and no guacamole in sight.... Did I mention the SALT? Sad to say we won&#39;t be back...."

For the price, I would go more inner city to a more authentic Mexican restaurant than H+H.  The food is usual - not spicy, not very flavorful- mostly caters to the Anglo Saxon type residents instead of an authentic taste palate.  I&#39;m not saying it isn&#39;t tasty- I enjoy eating here.  And if I doused it with hot sauce = yes my mouth would burn - but choosing not to do that.  
It is a normal sit down with normal to me food."

When you walk in it is a trip. I had never been here before and was at a car show down the block so I was looking for some where to eat. It&#39;s a mixture of a cantina, a Chinese food restaurant and I would say a western saloon from the 1860s. We were the only people in there at five o&#39;clock on  a wednesday. The service was good and the lady some have refered to as grandma was super nice. Our combined total was less then $20 which was a good deal for the ammount of food we got, we were both filled up. I would come back if I&#39;m in the area."

We went here for lunch for the first time. No one was in there! The decor was a mish-mash of grandma&#39;s house, tropical, Mexican, and Easter decorations. The menu was equally a hot mess of Mexican, brunch and American food.  We could not help but laugh at sitting in the ridiculous booths.
The chips and salsa were amazing and complimentary. The rest of the food was ok (some of us got Mexican, some got brunch)

Overall, a hilarious experience, but probably one I wouldn&#39;t repeat."

The smell was a strong potpourri, and the decor was quite outdated. Still, we were in the mood for Mexican, so decided to stick around...and we were glad we did. The service was friendly. Most of all though, the food was surprisingly good. We recommend the cod-Mexican style, or the pollo a la Mexicana-both had fresh ingredients, a unique sauce, and seemed home-cooked. Took a little while to get us our food, but that seemed to be because they cooked it from scratch. We&#39;d go back."

I have passed by H &amp; H for years, well like a decade. I never went in because I pretty much profiled the building. Today was a new day I just had to try it.

Walking into H &amp; H the same feeling of reservations continued as I was led to my table by a very nice and sweet lady. The decor is righteously outdated but yet it really wasn&#39;t a big deal.

As soon as you open the menu you will notice both American and Mexican food is their specialty. Anything goes ranging from a hamburger, salad and full blown mexican menu and breakfast.

I dove right into the Carne a la Mexicana, beef chunks with green peppers, onions, cilantro and cheese. Served with rice, beans and the most amazing homemade chips and salsa. The complimentary chicken poblano soup was on point and tasty.

The staff is friendly, super friendly and will go out of their way to make you feel at home. I will compare eating here to a dining experience at grandma&#39;s house.

I took away 1 star because I felt there was an over abundance of cilantro on my plate and the green pepers were cut way to thin into strips (a tad pointy). A little more generous Mexican rice portion would have been lovely too.

On the real, I would visit H &amp; H again. Just don&#39;t judge a book by its cover and wait 10 years like I did."

One lady working the whole place. When we first got there another couple (there before us) got up and left because she never even came to them to get an order.

You cannot get access to the restaurant without paying the entrance fee to the arboretum. 

The restaurant is self-serve cafeteria style, with a tiny coffee shop outside of it. There are different stations (salad bar, hot sandwiches, snacks and drinks, and cold sandwiches/boxed lunches), and you just choose whatever you like for your tray. The prices are a bit higher, but you can expect that at concession areas for parks anywhere. I think that the prices are actually pretty fantastic for what you get. A burger and fries is $8.25, for example, but you get a huge burger and a big serving of fries, and they are more of a restaurant quality than a greasy fast food, like concessions at the games or fairs might be. They also have many other options such as quiche, fish tacos, flatbread pizzas (yum!), pulled pork, and many salads. They are quite food-allergy and veggie friendly. They also offer an assortment of drinks, including bottled beer (I saw Two Brothers specifically).

The seating area is totally worth any extra money that you paid for your food. All of the walls are windows, and you look out upon the Meadow Lake, one of the most scenic and picturesque spots in the entire Arboretum. 

This area is also available for rental for special events, and the Arb hosts many of their own special events here too. They offer a breakfast with Santa and with the Easter Bunny, which are great for the kids. All of this information is available on their website.

Can&#39;t recommend the quiche at all on my recent visit and the kale salad was good but kind of pricey as a small side at $3.

Always our favorite place after the hours playing in the Children&#39;s garden in  Morton Arboretum. My daughter has to have her Gala apple from here even I have a whole case from Costco at home. I love the beautiful waterfront view which you could enjoy in any season.

Most of their food are decent and priced right. I really liked their salad.

Last week, I was kind of surprised to see the lamb stew on the menu and decided to go for that. The interesting part was that this stew was served in a big soup bow without any bread nor rice nor noodles. I asked if I could get a piece of bread to go with it. He said I need to ask the staff in sandwich section which had a long line. How could you serve the stew as an Entree without any sides? It just didn&#39;t make any sense to me.

They had the ceremony on the grounds, which was done very well! My only complaint would be that there was no sound system, so watching the ceremony was a little like watching a show on mute. However, not really sure if that would be the couple&#39;s choice or lack of ability for the venue. The ceremony was in the middle of a field :p

The cocktail hour was held outside the Gingko cafe...the appetizers were delish and unique considering it was a catered menu! Come to the main course, the braised short ribs were awesome! They were fork tender with a red wine demi. The service was great with enough waitstaff to keep everyone&#39;s waters and wines full. Overall, I&#39;d definitely recommend this location to any friend looking for a unique wedding venue!"

The line is out the door, soup, pasta etc is getting cold while waiting 30 minutes to get to me.  AND I was 3rd in line.  No not 15th in line but 3rd!  Incompetency will be the demise of the cafe.

Now on to the food, their BBQ pulled pork sandwich was very nice - also requires the shortest wait time besides the pre-made sandwich and corn dogs.

The dining room with the nice view is the same as that used for a wedding banquet we attended earlier in the year.  We found the food quality to be quite good and reasonably priced - it is made or cooked to order, and served cafeteria style.  There can be a bit of a wait for a weekend lunch, but it&#39;s worth the wait.  I had a 1/2 lb cheese sirloin burger served on pretzel roll (brioche and wheat bread also offered) with pasta salad ($7.99), and wife had their flat iron steak with onion rings and mixed veggies ($9.79).  The meats were excellent, but the pasta salad I had was dried out and hard, and they gladly substituted fries or onion rings upon request.   There are salad, sandwich, grill, and Italian stations.   Nice place for a food stop while visiting the arboretum."

4 stars for beverage selection. Soft drinks, juices, teas, wines, Starbucks coffee, still water, Perrier, and several styles of Two Brothers beers. 

3 stars for food. I usually stick with the salad of baby greens, goat cheese, dried cranberries &amp; nuts or the quiche with fruit cup. Decent food. Nothing outstanding. Cafeteria style. A bit overpriced. 

2 stars for service. Employees are civil &amp; will smile, but are not necessarily helpful or friendly. 

2 stars for the always crumb-covered and occasionally food-encrusted tables &amp; chairs. I have never seen employees attending to the tables. 

Bonus points for outdoor seating, but the best view of the lake is actually from inside the dining room."

The dining room itself has a lot of tables and can get quite crowded.  This is the type of cafeteria where you take your trays with you when you leave and drop them off at the window for the scullery.  No one clean the tables; at least no one that we could see.  Our table &#34;only&#34; had a few crumbs, but sloppy eaters do exist and I really do not want to bus any tables.  Enough of the dining room.

To order food, you have to wend your way through crowds to get to the sandwich station or a grilling station or pizza/specialties section.  Lines tended to form haphazardly and this can cause confusion and possible disagreements about who&#39;s next for service.

But, let&#39;s say you get in the &#34;right&#34; line.  There are no menus at any of the stations and the small printed menu near the entrance doesn&#39;t accurately reflect what is being served.  Both my wife and I ordered from the sandwich line.  It was loud and noisy and difficult to communicate with the sandwich maker.  I asked for beef on wheat and American cheese.  There were more meats (e.g., salami) available than what the menu showed.  I noticed this only after I ordered.  Fortunately, it was beef that I wanted otherwise I would have made the person remake the sandwich.  I questioned whether I was getting wheat bread or something else that resembled wheat.  The person said it was wheat.  The menu only lists a 9-grain bread.  I don&#39;t know what I got.  Fries are are not,listed anywhere on the sandwich menu.  That is part of the grill station.  Fortunately, I did not have to go to the grill station for fries; the sandwich maker got them for me.  My wife ordered the same but with slightly different extras.  The sandwiches themselves were fair.  The amount of meat was good, but the bread was dry and I had a hard time keeping it from crumbling.

The drink station was good,  This one actually includes wine.  I didn&#39;t see any beer, which I may have gotten had I seen someone who could tell me where to look.  The biggest problem with the drink station is that there is NO PLACE to set the tray down.  Holding a heavy  tray with one hand while picking out a drink is a real pain the the wrist.

The prices are a bit high, but that seems typical with this kind of attraction (the arboretum).   

All in all, after hours tromping on the grounds, this is a decent, yet disorganized place to get something to eat.  Timing is everything.  Had the crowds been any larger, the restaurant would have been more like a zoo on a busy Sunday afternoon."

Though the restaurant was open, no staff were waiting behind the counter/grill to actually cook.  Items cooked on the grill are VERY slow to be made and the line moves slowly.  Could use another toaster for the &#34;toast your own toast&#34; that comes with the breakfast dishes.  Outside of the restaurant, the cafe/coffee counter offers lighter fare and specialty coffee but again, the service is slow.  Overall there were a lot of staff/workers walking around but only one person actually helping the customer in each area making for a very long wait.  Can&#39;t beat the view in the restaurant."

I&#39;ve had pizza (they have roasted veggie), a wrap, and a burger (they have one with walnuts and brie) here and you get more than your money&#39;s worth!  These average $5-$6.  All of it is tasty and served nice and hot since you order and then watch them make it.  The lines can get long, so be prepared for that.  Lots of people are milling around trying to figure out what to get and some idiots have their stroller.  There isn&#39;t enough room for those SUV size rigs.  Small strollers are ok.

They do have kids meals which include cheese pizza, hot dogs, burgers and nuggets.  These are $4-$5.  The kids cheese pizza is a whole plate.  Great size for my boys!  The homemade potato chips are REALLY yummy!

I have been to M Burgers in Chicago and have never had a bad experience so I am seriously disappointed and don&#39;t plan on ever going to this location ever again. Management really needs to get their stuff together and train their employees so that this doesn&#39;t continue to happen.

So here&#39;s the story...My mom and I stopped here right  before we were about to go shopping and when we walked in, it was so hot and steamy inside, you could barely see where you were going. I am positive they had turned the fire alarms off b/c there was no way they wouldn&#39;t have been going off all day if they hadn&#39;t (super safe guys!). People inside were coughing and waving their hands since it was unbearable and starting to get difficult to breathe... now people, it was cold out yet people were forced to sit outside and eat their burgers because the degenerate employees couldn&#39;t think to open a door or a window.

To top it all off, my burger wasn&#39;t made the way I wanted, the fries were soggy, and after we left, we REAKED so much of grease and smoke, my mother and I ended up going home and not shopping at all that day....

I know they say they use the best ingredients but there are plenty of places that use the best quality ingredients and their food tastes a lot better. 

This time I ordered a double cheeseburger. The meat was weird to me. There was mini chunks of fat that just grossed me out. Definitely not the best quality meat I&#39;ve ever had. 

I also had a twist cone. Although the price and size was good, I was not impressed either. It just wasn&#39;t that tasty. It will do the trick and children will be happy but I&#39;m not going out of my way to get one of their cones. 

For the Aurora Outlet mall, there are hardly any good food options. Although M Burger is not my thing, I do think it is better than some of the other options in the Mall. Maybe their chicken tastes better?"

After they argued over who&#39;s fault it was the line cook took his hand and grabbed the peppers off the top, added more cheese and handed them back to the girl. When I questioned what just happened I would told there would be some peppers because they are in the cheese sauce. (Funny the order my friend got with peppers on the side had no peppers in sauce).  Got out side to meet my party and my sandwich had mayo. When I took it back inside I was asked if I just wanted them to scrape it off, otherwise they would have to remake my sandwich.
That should have been the clue to just get a refund. He offered me back the fries that the cook handled and I ask them to just make at least something I ordered correctly. Many dirty looks from the staff. Offered to bring food out to me so I&#39;m sure it was great conversation when I stepped outside. Finally got my food after the rest of my party was done."

Lets start by saying that I think the burgers are really good. But that is where it ends. 
My first couple of visits were  pretty typical but there was always something that bothered me. I noticed that the cashier was also handling food. which I found odd, but I guess it didn&#39;t bother me til, I saw that the cashier was wearing gloves and handling money, and not changing gloves. He literally had just handed a gentleman his change(coins), and then proceeded to handle my food, and I mean he directly touched my food with the gloves on that he just handed money to someone with. I said something to him about it, and he apologized and provided me fresh food. I later discovered that he was a manager. On my next visit a worker who was brooming the cook area wearing gloves, immediately changed positions and starting plating food(again, gloves did not change. This Time I contacted lettuce entertain you, which is the corp. that owns M burger, and I aired my concerns. They assured me that they would go over procedures with the store and they were kind enough to provide me with $20 in gift cards that could be used at only M burger. 
Well today I went back, and boy was it interesting. My wife and I ordered, I ordered a double M burger, and she ordered a double cheeseburger. It took about 5 minutes to get rung up since apparently nobody in the store had ever seen a gift certificate like the one I had(which was no big deal, it got handled without incident). I picked up my food when my number was called, and went back to my table. My wife looked at her burger and realized that it didn&#39;t seem like what she ordered, FOLLOW ME HERE, THIS IS IMPORTANT. I picked up the burger and opened it a little and realized there was only one patty(obviously the wrong burger). So I took the entire order back to the counter and let the guy know that I thought we had the wrong order. He took it and he and another employee took a look(without touching anything and figured out that My burger was correct and they simply grabbed the wrong burger for my wife. they had her burger waiting right there at the cook station. I got my food and that should be where this story ends. BUT NO. I made a point to keep watch and see what would become of the &#34;wrong burger&#34;. That&#39;s right!!!! they plated it for the customer that ordered it, and gave it to them(they were unaware what had happened with my order). THAT FOOD HAD GONE TO MY TABLE AND I TOUCHED IT. I am a clean person and did not do anything weird to the food, but holy hell!!! I assumed they would have trashed it and made a new one for that persons order.

MORAL OF THE STORY FOLKS.... EAT THERE IF YOU WANT, BUT BE SURE TO WATCH EVERY STEP THAT YOUR FOOD TAKES. CAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW."

The burgers were small and really salty and the fries were not good at all. I had to use ketchup just to be able to eat them - and I literally don&#39;t EVER use ketchup! But I paid for them and I was starving, so ketchup it was! If they&#39;re trying to be like Five Guys, they&#39;re definitely failing.

The staff are patient with me when I decide to go with something other than my usual Turkey Tom and I&#39;m unsure of what else I might want. The staff are friendly, the sandwiches are made to my specifications in under 2 minutes, the only thing that I will say negatively is that the staff who are idle tend to have conversations that are not entirely work place friendly. Being younger myself, I don&#39;t really care that much and it&#39;s not usually a problem, but adults who are better at adulting than me might find the subject matter unsuitable.

Ricardo was absolutely phenomenal! Hands down. The best. Ever. He made great recommendations and had our drinks on the table within minutes. 
We started with the seared Ahi, which was super spicy- and delicious! I opted for the New York Strip, which would have been fantastic, but my husband had the Waygu- which was WAY worth the extra cash- it was buttery and charred to perfection.
The garlic mashed were a great accompaniment, although we hardly touched them after eating the appetizer and steak.

I made a reservation to celebrate a birthday, and even mentioned it to the hostess while we were being sat. They did nothing to celebrate. The table next to us was celebrating an anniversary and they got special experience. Was very upsetting to see we were celebrating the wrong thing apparently. 

The service went horribly wrong from the moment we were sat. We arrived 15 minutes early to our reservation. They said no problem we can seat you in a few moments. So we stood awkwardly in the lobby for at least 5-10 minutes. The hostess walked us back to a booth right outside the kitchen. It was very noisy so we asked for a different table in a very empty restaurant. Instead of moving us to another table she asked us to sit in the booth and wait while she went back to the hostess stand to figure out a new place to sit us. Then, she took us to another section on the restaurant and brought us to a table. We asked if we could sit in the booth one table away and she said that section was closed. I&#39;ve worked at a restaurant, and understand they only had a few servers on. That&#39;s when you ask them to pick up out of there section. This is supposed to a nice restaurant, you figure it out. 

When our server got to our table the poor experience continued. I asked for a dirty Hendricks martini. He didn&#39;t listen and asked if I wanted it up and kept asking me these questions. When the drink came out there were no olives. He told me I had to request olives. That&#39;s why I ordered it dirty in the first place! He was also kind of rude throughout the course of the meal. There was truly no chance in saving this experience at this point. 

When we talked to the manager at the end, yes they tried to fix it by adjusting our bill and a gift card. I can promise you I won&#39;t be using that gift card. For a steak house and when I&#39;m paying that much on a bill, I expect a good experience. Don&#39;t waste your time coming here. Rude staff and poor service is what you can expect."

We made dinner reservations for 7:30 pm, but planned to go early and hang out in the bar area for a bit since they have live music on Fridays starting at 5:30 pm. We got there about 6:30 pm, ordered an appetizer, and drinks, and actually ended up hanging out there for like 3 hours! We felt bad, but our waitresses were super cool and just said to let us know when we were ready and they&#39;d get us a table. Pretty great considering it was a Friday night.

Although drinks are pricey, the bar area is a pretty nice spot to spend some time. It&#39;s classy but casual all at the same time. Our waitress was nice and super friendly. The music was jazzy and perfect for the space --¬†not too loud, but still entertaining. My only complaint was that it was absolutely freezing in there. They need to turn down the air conditioning!

We finally decided it was time to eat some food about 9:30 pm. Here&#39;s the breakdown of what we got...

Cheese steak egg rolls with sweet &amp; spicy chili sauce &amp; honey mustard: Tasty! My husband really loved these. So much so that we had an order early on in the bar, and placed another order when we sat down for dinner.

Prix fix menu ($45) which included, shrimp and lobster bisque soup, 6 oz. filet mignon with horseradish mashed potatoes, and black velvet cake: All amazing! The soup was flavorful, the filet melted in my mouth, the mashed potatoes were addicting, and the cake was super sweet and delicious, but very rich -- I only had one or two bites!

Service was great and our food came out super fast (which was good considering how late we were eating). Up at the host stand they have tons of awards hanging on the wall. I was kind of surprised to see so many &#34;most romantic&#34; awards, because I didn&#39;t really get that vibe. Regardless, Sullivan&#39;s offers quality food and is conveniently located downtown Naperville which makes for a great date night!"

It was a very good experience and I wouldn&#39;t hesitate returning. 

It&#39;s across from the Naperville Riverwalk which is very beautiful and peaceful. That was a great start. The restaurant is a typical steakhouse and is very clean and the ambiance is spot on. Nicely done. 

We were seated quickly and our waiter was very good. Attentive without trying to push us through the meal. We started with the Calamari. It had a spicy/sweet sauce with nuts and sesame seeds. I have to stay away from the nuts, and they had no problem accommodating it. It was very good. 

For dinner, I decided to try their Salmon. My friend had a 3 course dinner with the filet.  The salmon is a huge portion done very well. It was really fresh. The asparagus on the side was done very well too. Sometimes it&#39;s a bit underdone and they nailed it. 

We went with a recommended Cabernet with dinner which hit the spot. 

The only reason I am not giving it five stars, is they had nothing memorable. If I lived in Naperville, this would be a go-to destination for any formal meal or business dinner. I would look forward to trying everything on their menu. 

I do live quite far (30+ miles) and there was nothing that said I had to make the trip next time I wanted steak. If I am ever in the area, I wouldn&#39;t hesitate stopping in again, if nothing else for a cocktail and appetizer."

I am writing this update because I dined at Sullivan&#39;s last night and this place has gotten worse.  WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO SULLIVAN&#39;S???  

My date ordered the wedge salad and they brought him a small, naked piece of lettuce and a side of chopped tomatoes.  That&#39;s it!  We looked at each other like, &#39;Are you f*****g kidding me?&#39;  EVERYBODY KNOWS THEIR WEDGE SALAD IS SUPPOSED TO BE DRESSED.  I asked for the blue cheese topping for my $50 rib eye and got only a spattering of something that kind of resembled blue cheese.  I give it 1 star because our server, David, was great and the mac-n-cheese and asparagus were good.  Yelp really should have a zero star option.  

I adore upscale dining and Sullivan&#39;s no longer fits the bill.  As I wrote 5 years ago, there are so many other great steakhouses in the Naperville/Oak Brook area to suffer their sub par food/service.  Sullivan&#39;s simply does not care about customers or the quality of your dining experience anymore.  Frankly, you can go to Outback and enjoy better food and service at a fraction of the price.

For the price, I&#39;d prefer to go to Hugo&#39;s or Morton&#39;s.

The manager came over and said that because it was our anniversary dessert would be on him, it wasn&#39;t. I was excited for the augratin potatoes, they tasted like they were from a box and not at all cheesy. I had the black velvet cake (part of the fixed meal I picked). From the description it seemed like it would be like classic red velvet cake but with chocolate cake. It was very generic, looked like a little chocolate brownie with chocolate icing?! 

New York strip and ribeye were delicious, as was the Moscow Mules and jalape√±o crab gnocchi. Flower petals on the table were a nice touch. Service was very attentive but honestly the food overall was just ok."

There is a great variety of appetisers, (my favourite foods!) unique to Sullivan&#39;s. One of my favourites is the ahi tuna nachos.

Their steaks and sides are what you would expect from a steakhouse. Perfectly cooked filets, thick, creamy mashed potatoes, tender vegetables.

Once we were seated it took 10 minutes to get some kind of drink, which ended up being water that we had to ask the bus boy for after not even being greeted by the server. Once the waiter finally came over we were able to place our drink order, then when the waiter brought out the wine it was the wrong kind of wine he brought back. The food order they got correct, but the food was okay and nothing to knock anyone&#39;s socks off.

I could not give Sullivan&#39;s more than three stars for two reasons:

1.  Waiter and hostesses were unfriendly and unwelcoming.  They were a bit pompous until they saw that our party was tallying a big bill and not ordering from a discounted menu.

2.  Even though we had a reservation, hostesses sat us immediately next to another table.  We were so unreasonably close, it was as if a small group of strangers were sitting at our same table.  Seriously, at medium voice level- I could hear their entire dinner conversation.

Again, steaks and servers were good- but I expect it to be good.  For the same price, I&#39;ll drive an extra 20 minutes to Gibson&#39;s in Oakbrook."

This management makes waiting for your table - that you have reserved - incredibly frustrating and stressful. Not only that, but the the wait estimations were some of the most inaccurate, deceitful promises I have ever heard - 20 minutes after reservation, then 20 more minutes, then &#34;any moment&#34;, THEN 15 more minutes, and then another 5 minutes of waiting.

Management - get your act together. This is the most disrespectful display of restaurant maintenance I&#39;ve ever seen."

The other couple and my husband and I were seated quickly with our reservation. We were in an area which had been an enclosed patio, which was well temperature controlled in 90+weather. 

The service was good, tho way over attentive. It was so noticeable that the other couple, just back from Rome, commented about the absolute difference between fine dining there and the multiple interruptions here. The management also showed up, several times, and in the end it felt like we were rushed to finish and leave, sad to say. 

Up selling is definitely their thing, to the point it was not appreciated. Since we were the first ones in the room I was not aware ice water was even available until seeing it on the table next to us as we left. Ours was bottle water we paid for, and room temperature. Since I do not drink liquor it was a bad first impression. The martini, beer for others, French onion soup, salad, entrees and all different deserts were fine. 

The total was over $200, which rather surprised our friends, but since they had $100 gift card they were ok. 

Parking was on street and there was valet, so that is not an issue. 

Would I go back? Not too likely to this location, even tho food was good."

Out of the many times I&#39;ve been there I&#39;ve only had 1 bad experience. They truly care for their guests and work to make sure and bad experience is rectified. I will absolutely be back :)

Service was so great our water glasses were never emptied. Our server was great with checking on us and making sure our food got to us in a timely matter. The manager even made a stop at our table to make sure the meal was to our liking. Which I feel is rare because usually restaurant managers do not waste their time on younger customers. We are in our mid 20s. Really made my birthday dinner amazing. Obviously on the pricier side but it is well worth it.

They have great food, although I think they&#39;re a little on the pricey side. For lunch offerings, I like the kale salad or the fish tacos while my hubs prefers a burger. Cost is about $17 pp including soft drinks, but the location is say to get to with a lot of parking nearby."

Our family brought us take-out and I ate the food with my wife at a hospital in the recovery room after the birth of our son.

We really enjoyed the steaks here! We both had a Filet Mignon and it was absolutely perfect. We also had the mashed potatoes and cream style spinach, and those sides were excellent as well. Even the bread and butter was very good. It was a great surprise and was a nice break from hospital food. The prices seem a little high from what I saw on the menu, but I&#39;m not going to argue with food that tastes this good even after being transported as take-out. I think that we would like to try and come in sometime on another special occasion."

I&#39;ve lived walking distance to Sullivan&#39;s for over 10 years and have frequented it often over the years, even before I lived so close. It&#39;s becoming an old timey, washed up supper club. There are newer, better restaurants in the area that rival the quality and service.  

If you must go, stick with the steak. As it&#39;s a steakhouse, they have that down.  But don&#39;t stray with the sides.

Last visit, I got a mixed greens salad with my steak and my daughter had Mac and cheese and steamed broccoli.  My salad was soggy and the Mac and cheese had bacon bits. Nowhere on the menu did it say bacon bits, and to top it off, they tasted fake like what you&#39;d expect to be shaken out of a little jar from the supermarket. Inedible. Broccoli was an abundant serving size, enough to feed all 4 of us, but we could only choke down a few bland pieces.

Out of nowhere, our waitress apologized over and over for under pouring my hubs&#39; wine and when she left for 15 minutes to try to find him more wine, my husband laughed so hard as he compared with mine which was exact same level. She kept pushing sodas on my son, once even bringing him 2 at once.  She also used obvious techniques to identify with everything we said, coming off as completely disingenuous in the end. 

We got some good laughs out of the whole scene but will likely find a new spot for our next nice dinner out."

This ranks somewhere above an Outback Steakhouse and below a Morton&#39;s. Service is always above the mark, atmosphere is cozy and mature, prices are affordable. It&#39;s easy to rack up a bill of $200 if you get drinks, apps, sides and dessert. We opted for the price fix menu and 2 drinks to start. Our bill was around $150. A little too pricey for regular dining but fits the bill for a night out celebrating a special occasion. We went for our anniversary and got complimentary cheesecake. 4 out of 5 only because we felt a little rushed. Bill was on our table before we even placed our dessert order. For a special night out, feeling rushed is not ideal."

On one of our recent visits my wife suddenly became very ill and became unconscious at the table.  I had to jump up so that she didn&#39;t fall back in her chair.  A couple next to us were very helpful and our waiter also sprung to action.  Paramedics arrived and to make a long story short, she was alright and the management covered our check.  Our food hadn&#39;t arrived yet but it was boxed up and we were able to enjoy it the following day at home.   I can&#39;t even begin to say how thankful and impressed we were with their utmost professionalism and courtesy. 

And the food is excellent.  Wonderful atmosphere and servers are top notch.  My only complaint is that even with a reservation we&#39;ve waited upwards of 20 minutes for our table and the sitting area is very small unless you want to sit in the bar.  Otherwise this place is fantastic.  We will be back for years to come."

Very sorry experience.  Had I known they were doing a &#34;limited&#34; menu for Valentine&#39;s Day - would have gone elsewhere.

I ordered the &#34;rack of Lamb&#34; medium rare.  I was expecting delicious lamb goodness.  I&#39;ve never had a tougher piece of lamb.  The monster steak knife that Sullivan&#39;s provides even had some tough points.  If there was not a sauce for the lamb, it would have been so very plain and bland.  

The cocktails were solid and the wine was great, but the lamb supplier needs to lose the contract &amp; the chef needs to go back to school and visit a competitors restaurant to see what a rack of lamb should be.  Shame on Sullivan&#39;s for pushing a lame &#34;limited&#34; menu with sub-par quality.  

Staff was great and the tip was commensurate."

Certainly not worth the $44 for the ribeye steak (go to Costco and buy 3 for the same price). Ambiance OK, but they are really fussy and keep interrupting your meal. Hard to read the menu; it&#39;s pretty dark.  Weirdest experience ever: the waiter walked up with our check/credit card after running it, called my husband by his first name then shook his hand.  Wait staff shouldn&#39;t initiate shaking customer&#39;s hands. Bizarre.  The two stars are for the dinner.
I have been there on a Thursday and had a phenomenal burger in the bar.  THAT I&#39;d recommend with 5 stars, if you can get a seat."

I brought my friend here for her birthday last night. She had never been to a fancy steakhouse and was excited to go. I hoped it would be a dinner she would never forget.
The waiter was excellent, he is the reason I didn&#39;t give one star, but the main course was not even mediocre. The steak was so tough, it was so hard to cut, let alone chew. There were long green beans that were impossible to cut as well, extremely tough and barely cooked, inedible. I brought the steak and green beans home to give to my dogs. They thought it was 5 stars!
The mashed potatoes were very good, as was the philly cheese eggroll. I wish I had only gotten those 2 things. My friend did not complain so I didn&#39;t either because it would have embarrassed her, but I was very sad about the quality of food for such exorbitant prices. I highly doubt that their meat is prime, although it is priced as if it is. Sullivans is incredibly overpriced. Even half the price would have been too much for this meal.
I wish we had made the drive into the city to go to Lawrys, or driven a few more minutes to go to Mortons.
Avoid this place unless you want to throw money away."
sullivans-steakhouse-naperville,Walt K.,oHMxEn2H8xaQyPo9JTQMWg,"Oswego, IL",0,1,0,0,12,DjrxP9tNb6VHShMplOVFCw,5.0,2015-08-16,"My Wife and I arrived early for our 7:00pm Saturday reservation checking in with Casey in the front.  The waiting area was jam packed so we proceeded the find a spot along the wall out of the foot traffic to begin our wait to be seated.  7 o&#39;clock came and went, it did not appear we were going to be seated anytime soon.  Patiently we stood.  It was actually 7:11 when a manager in training, Jacob approached us indicating he&#39;d noticed us waiting patiently for quite awhile and he&#39;d like to buy us a couple drinks.  We replied vehemently with a &#34;yes&#34; yet were unsure what we wanted.  Upon Jacob returning with a drink menu, and making a very good recommendation, we both ordered our complimentary drinks.  While he was away obtaining the drinks, our name was called, it was 7:13.  We were seated and our drinks found their way to our table.  A good start.

We were greeted very promptly by our waitress Kristina.  She was bubbly and very helpful as we had never been to Sullivan&#39;s before.  She answered all our questions and when she was unsure, she returned with answers promptly.

The restaurant is perfectly lit, not to dark and not to light.  No outside windows is what I always prefer so getting the lighting correct for this type of restaurant can be difficult but Sullivans pulled it off very well.

Noise.  Yes, it is noisy in here.  I would say it&#39;s definitely well above average and a negative for a lot of people but based on the large room with every table visibly full, it could not be avoided.  It was not so noisy that you could not hear across the table and my Wife and I did not have a hard time communicating whatsoever.

Table Placement.  The tables are quite close to each other.  Much closer than most I would say and borderline infringing on other patrons comfort zones.  I can say that the noise level may have actually helped as even though everyone sits close to others, I cannot say I was able to hear anything of substance from anyone else around us.

Food.  We ordered a la carte off the menu as we wanted specific items. The Kale salad and the Iceberg Lettuce wedge were a perfect start, well, after consuming a good deal of the extremely hot bread brought to us after we were seated.  We also ordered a side of mushroom caps, very tasty, very good portion.  Our entrees were the Bone in Ribeye cowboy cut, advertised as 22 oz. and believe me when I say, it was at least 22 oz. maybe more.  I ordered it Medium and it arrived Medium.  Very well done.  My wife ordered the Sea Bass and it was prepared and presented to absolute perfection.

As we were celebrating our 15th Anniversary, we mentioned this several times when asked if we were celebrating anything special.  I had heard that they may take a picture and/or giving a free desert for such an occurrence but did not expect anything to come of it.  No picture was taken, but we were offered and accepted the free desert.  We order the Peanut Butter Black Bottom Pie.  OK, now don&#39;t laugh but not only did it not look like pie, it actually resembled a &#34;Minion&#34; in shape.  It was a good portion of peanut butter goodness on what appeared to be an Oreo base with whipped cream on the side.

As we were approaching the end of the dinner, Latoya stopped by to ask how everything was.  We exclaimed excellent once again stating why we were there and what we were expecting.  We indicated how we felt everything met or exceeded our expectations.  I told her how my Dirty Martini was the best one I&#39;d ever had and my Wife commented on how good her Vodka Gimlet was.  Latoya thanked us for dining here and with a friendly smile departed.  Moments later, Latoya returned sporting, you guessed it, a Dirty Martini and a Gimlet on the house.  Wow.  We were already sold, but this topped of an unbelievably wonderful Evening.

Now I know it&#39;s almost impossible to say nothing could have been better but I have to say, this was as close to perfect as we could have imagined it would be.  After having to wait for a table missing the reservation time we had made, we were not thinking at that moment of a return visit, but I have to say that the exception friendliness and professional service from all staff, we definitely are looking forward to returning to Sullivans.

The pricing is also a bit higher than we usually are used to (with tip we came in just shy of a couple C Notes) but I have to say that the value we received for everything we experienced while there made it very well worth it.  Yes, for that kind of money you expect the very best, but that is by no means a guarantee.  Good Job Sullivan&#39;s, you are definitely a top rate quality establishment, we look forward to returning and will not hesitate to recommend you to anyone and everyone."

We opted to pay the corking fee and brought our own wine as their list was pretty pricey.  The food was also pricey but absolutely worth it.  They do have options for those of us on a budget that allowed us to have a starter, main course, and dessert.  Everything was delicious and cooked to perfection! Will definitely go back."

The manager Michael stopped by to asked &#34;how is your lunch&#34; in which I responded &#34;ehh&#34; and he said good to hear and walked away. For a top end steak house I was shocked and felt as though I shouldn&#39;t have even payed the bill. Thank you Dan for being the only positive experience.

Parking was a bit of a pain but really, it&#39;s downtown Naperville so you already know going into it that parking is going to be a challenge on a Friday night. We had a reservation and did not have to wait more than 5 minutes to be seated (A+). When we walked up to the table Sullivan&#39;s had decorated it with beautiful fresh rose petals &amp; a little card saying happy anniversary. Our server was WONDERFUL, very attentive but not pesky and had great recommendations.

We decided the prix fixe menu would be the best for us since we couldn&#39;t agree on a side to share lol. We both had filet&#39;s which were cooked perfect to what we ordered, but most notably the dessert they brought us was just stunning! Some of the reviews on here have a photo showing it but they let you choose whatever you like and they write in chocolate on the plate happy anniversary. Also they even take a nice little photo for you with your pretty little dessert and put it in a cardstock frame for you to take home as a little keepsake. SO CUTE!

I&#39;ve had better steaks elsewhere, but these were still great and for the level of service/attention to detail I think this place is worth it. Maybe not for a regular date night, but absolutely for a special occasion."

We had such a great time, and considering I just had a terrible experience at a similar restaurant in the city earlier in the week, I felt compelled to write a review for such a good night. 

We got stuck in a bit of traffic on the way in, but I called and the hostess told me not to worry about it. We got there around 7pm for a 6:45pm reservation. We did have to wait a few minutes, but that was our fault anyway. We were seated and our server, Erica, came over. She was fantastic the whole time. I made sure to get her name off the receipt before we left so that I could mention her. 

As far as food goes, everything was delicious. I got the $42 pre fixe menu. My choices were the shrimp cocktail, iceberg wedge and the filet with mashed potatoes. I will say, I wasn&#39;t crazy about the cocktail sauce that came with the shrimp and my salad was sort of blah, I would probably get a Cesar next time, but my filet was phenomenal. Potatoes were amazing. My fiance got the 12oz filet and french fries and said it was good too. We also ordered a side of their brussels sprouts, and those were delicious. 

Sullivan&#39;s always does it up when it is a special occasion; our server took our picture and printed it and placed it in a paper frame that said &#34;Happy Anniversary&#34; and was signed by the staff. They also gave us a complimentary dessert. We chose the Smores Mousse cake, and it was a bit too sweet but it was still ok. 

The thing that made this night special was the outstanding service. There was always someone there to help, bring us water, etc. The manager stopped by the table too. It was a really great evening!"

Ordered a bottle of Justin Cabernet, if you haven&#39;t tried it you definitely should.  We bought this at Binny&#39;s before, great bottle that&#39;s also affordable.  We both ordered the three-course prix fixe.  Starting with the Calamari (I will be coming back just for this!) had an amazing Thai chili glaze.  Shrimp cocktail was good but you only get 3.  Lobster bisque with nice large pieces in it and the Caeser salad.  I ordered the filet med-rare but upgraded to the 12oz that Mike recommended.  Yes, 12oz!!!  My boyfriend ordered the Ribeye medium and upgraded to the bone-in cowboy.  Both came with mashed potatoes, we were very pleased.

Finished off the night with a bottle of Clos Du Val Cabernet which they happily corked the remaining to go.  We always save room for liquid dessert!  Surprised with complimentary White Russians and sorbet with a birthday candle.  It was a night to remember : )"

We were with my elderly in-laws so this was uncomfortable for them. The meal was mediocre at best. Crab kegs were cold and had no flavor. The salmon was overcooked and salty - nothing special. You could not even taste lemon in the Hollandaise sauce. The sides were so large that it was a waste of money and I feel the waitress should have told us we would be able to share them because they were so large.
The waitress told us she was going to bring a dessert to my father in law because it was his birthday but once we told her no one else wanted dessert she didn&#39;t bother.
Now - the real killer - the bill was so very high for what we got. Seriously I have had better food at restaurants charging 1/4 of the price. My first clue should have been that they don&#39;t
post the prices on the menus online.
We left feeling absolutely sick that we had spent that much money on a meal that was average at best. I don&#39;t mind spending money when the food and service is good but neither can be said about this place.
So many other good places to eat in downtown Nashville. Save your hard earned money and go elsewhere."

We were ignored by the front desk, and watched the couple in front of us storm out because a larger party was seated before us even though they came in after us and their reservation was after ours. We also eventually left and had a Nice dinner elsewhere. I thought about writing a review but knew it wouldn&#39;t be fair without truly having sat down and experiencing their food and service.

I&#39;M GLAD THAT I WAITED. 

We just got back from celebrating my wife&#39;s birthday. We had the utmost pleasure of being served by Kylee.  She was extremely pleasant and eager to understand our tastes and preferences. I&#39;ve never been asked at a restaurant if we had time constraints or if we would like our food to be brought out at a leisurely pace! Which we chose the latter. She had the timeliness down to a science and had a great smile each time she approached us. She even apologized that I had to look for her once during the meal. Another first for me. They offered my wife a complimentary dessert and even took our picture and put it in a framed &#34;happy birthday&#34; card that was signed by the staff. I have to say I have never experienced better service, even in the Signature Room downtown. The food was superb! Calamari appetizer was probably the highlight of the meal though, I could have had 3 plates. I also work in customer service and I learned a thing or two from Kylee. She is truly a professional and Sullivan&#39;s should be proud to have her on their team!"

The good:

1.  Excellent cuts of meat
2.  Wonderful wedge salad
3.  Awesome drink selection
4.  Very clean establishment
5.  Good managers/staff

The not so good:

1.  Prices have gone up over the last year(s)
2.  Very difficult to get a spot for dinner because they are so crowded
3.  Wait times if you come in off the street"

I don&#39;t understand how this place can have more than three stars. It is also very dark ... Kind of like a creepy back alley. 

Prices are completely outrageous for the portions delivered. It is a la carte so be prepared for a large bill, which I was. But for the price I paid I was underwhelmed. 

They do out their own spin on steak and other dishes they prepare which is enjoyable but for one time only. I will not be returning to sulivans anytime soon.  For great prices and tons of food go to Jameson&#39;s char house, it never disappoints and the prices include quality steak, and side dishes."

We  had 615p.m. reservations.  While waiting, we observed one family leave as their 40-minute delayed seating was too much.  Listened to no less than half-a-dozen folks inquire (some friendlier than others) as to the delay in their seating (most were at the 30-minute mark).  We were ready to leave as the one-hour delay approached when we were seated.  

The manager, LaToya, to make up for the delay, bought our appetizer (the best calamari, EVER) with a sincere and profound apology.  Our waiter, Aaron, could not have been more professional, courteous and friendly.  Halfway through our appetizer, noticed a member of the staff bringing bread to a dozen tables or so (we were not one of them).  My husband&#39;s steak was cooked perfectly, my medium cooked filet was on the rare side.

We have visited, throughout the country, many multiple great steak houses and none of them had an issue with seating within a 10-minute (never more) time frame of the original reservation.  Sullivan&#39;s of Naperville seems to have an issue with &#34;time management&#34; (as per many of the reviews I read prior to our reservation; when I called and asked &#34;Suzie&#34; if our 615p reservation would be met, her response was, &#34;I can&#39;t tell you that; between 5p-630p is our busiest time&#34;.  I asked her the point of making a reservation was and her response was, &#34;well, that&#39;s when WE expect you here&#34;!  YIKES!

We will return to this establishment but never during the holidays and either during the week or very early if a weekend date.  

The graciousness of the staff is worth a repeat visit."

The restaurant was busy, but not extremely crowded. 2 in our party had never dined at Sullivans and were excited at the experience, especially since we hyped it up to them prior to our visit. We shared an $85 bottle of Cabernet and our 2 guests asked the server if they could keep the empty bottle as a memento of the day. Our server responded ABSOLUTELY, in fact they would even get a silver Sharpie marker to personalize it with the details of our visit. However, once the bottle was emptied, our server promptly grabbed the bottle and discarded it....we realized it and mentioned it and she simply said &#34;Oops..didn&#39;t meant to do that&#34; but was never able to retrieve our bottle, nor the same, from another table (it was the special Wine of the day and I am SURE someone else was having the same).

On the food -  the other 3 in our party had the pre fixe turkey dinner, but found the gravy very salty. Otherwise the turkey was tender and sides were great too - especially the horseradish mashed potatoes! I ordered the Bone-in Strip steak (medium rare) with blue cheese crust, and a huge baked potato. I received a medium well (and tough) steak with just a few sprinkles of blue cheese, not a crust. I spoke to the server and she immediately took back the steak and had it remade quite quickly - done medium rare this time...but still tough (I can make a better steak on the grill at home with a steak from Costco). She had the manager stop by our table and he didn&#39;t really apologize, but acted as though &#34;We acknowledge your wrongly cooked steak, and its being fixed, so you should be good to go&#34; attitude. He didn&#39;t offer any comps (appetizer or dessert..not even a real caring that the mistake happened). I&#39;m sorry, but when you are a high-end steakhouse, the FIRST thing you should know how to do is properly cook a steak. Sorry, but next time we will go to Gibsons, or Mortons!"

The steak was requested to be medium rare and came out sitting in a pool of blood...very rare.  The service was horrible and the line of cooks looked like they just got out of prison and obviously are not accustomed to cooking in a fine dining atmosphere.  Tables were on top of each other and our waiter looked like he was 12.....horrible service.  We will never return to this location as the restrooms were a disaster and even the salads were Wiley and had too much dressing on them.

My parents have eaten here several times and have raved about the food; therefore, I had pretty high expectations. 

We had a reservation for 5:15pm and were seated pretty promptly following arrival. The waitress came to the table and asked if we would like to start off with a bottle of wine and maybe &#34;kiddie cocktails&#34; for the ladies. This was a quite awkward and disturbing comment as I am soon to be turning 23 and would have been better left unsaid, to say the least. The waitress then went on to suggest a wine for myself, mother and grandmother. We asked for something a little less sweet than a Moscato. She brought something back that couldn&#39;t have been further from what we asked for. I could not justify my dad spending $50 on a wine that made the entire table cringe and we asked to send it back, something we have NEVER done. Needless to say, we went with what we knew was good and ordered 2 bottles of wine. 

I ordered the prix fix meal for $42. The garlic meatballs were just okay, a little charred but tasted fine. Everyone enjoyed the salad that came with the meal, as well. When my 6oz filet mignon medium arrived I cut into the meat and it immediately fell flat into the center of the plate, something that has never happened before when cutting into a steak. I took one bit and looked and immediately discovered my steak was a piece of fat that obviously was cut off the end of the filet mignon. DISGUSTING. I had eaten a better filet mignon at Texas Roadhouse. My mom&#39;s was the exact same way. Once again, I couldn&#39;t justify spending the money and knew that Sullivan&#39;s must be able to do better than that. We sent our meals back and I was given a much better piece of meat that tasted great and also was given a free side of mac &amp; cheese which was excellent and probably one of the best foods I had eaten all night! I would not suggest ordering the grilled asparagus because it is very plain and there&#39;s no seasoning or anything on it. My sister&#39;s 8oz filet was delicious and my dad&#39;s Bone-In ribeye was great and there no complaints to be had regarding this. I would highly suggest the Bananas Foster for dessert! Served with warm bananas, bread pudding, carmel sauce and ice cream. 

Overall, I wish this had been a better experience. I had very high hopes for this steakhouse. I believe a better waitress would have turned the experience around a lot for us. In addition, I may not order the Prix Fix meal as I assume a lower quality of meat is served. I would be wiling to try this place again and hopefully can adjust my review!"

The other night I paid $75 for two extremely mediocre hamburgers ($15.50 each!) one martini and a shrimp cocktail appetizer and it&#39;s just no longer worth the money or the atmosphere.  The burgers were extremely disappointing.  I&#39;ve had better pretty much everywhere, excluding fast food burgers.

March 24th 2015 was my last meal there. It wasn&#39;t significantly horrible, but it&#39;s expensive and I can&#39;t keep paying their prices and hope we don&#39;t experience another off night, which is a shame because I used to love the place."

Finally, we were seated at a table that was literally a foot away from the next so conversation was awkward.  Our waitress was friendly enough but noted (and said) that she knew it was our first time there.  Huh?  To me, it appears that you need to be a regular to be treated well.

Sullivan&#39;s has excellent food and great wine and it&#39;s a shame that we had to chug our wine and order and eat quickly to make our event. We did not have time for an appetizer or salad, and we ran short of time for dessert. I think that is their problem when taking reservations. Too many in the time allotted.  People like to linger and enjoy their food, and we did not have that last night. To spend that kind of money on dinner and be kicked out the door is a serious problem.

I ordered the scallops and my bf ordered the lamb. They were both delicious. Lamb wasn&#39;t chewy at all (cooked to medium). The scallops were the BEST scallops I have ever had. You can tell that they are quality scallops. I just didn&#39;t like how they were cooked though... A little too salty/soy sauce. 

Their sides could use some work or some additions. Almost everything they had were so creamy. We ordered the sweet potato casserole and the creamed spinach. The creamed spinach was gross. I didn&#39;t like it and I could tell my bf didn&#39;t like it. I didn&#39;t want to ask. When we brought the leftovers home, I could tell our friend liked everything except the creamed spinach as well. 

Tips:
1. Seafood or red meat. You can&#39;t go wrong. 
2. Get the knockout martini. Yum!
3. Don&#39;t get the creamed spinach. 

P.S. I agree with the fellow Yelper. The waitresses were not dressed appropriately. The males were very formal with aprons down to their mid-shin, but the females were wearing black &#34;butt cheek short&#34; dresses."

My steak was way over-peppered and cooked a tad less than my medium request.  My dad said his steak was just so-so, again over peppered.

Service was fine.  I&#39;m not a prude by any means, but the uniforms could stand to be a bit classier given the setting."

What happened?
-Service - Much slower and not as professional as previous years.
-Quality- The food (esp Steak) seems cheaper. I would question if meat glue is perhaps being used on some cuts. 
-Overall Value - I don&#39;t mind spending a few hundred bucks for a good meal and do so on a regular basis. With more options opening all the time in driving distance, I prefer to spend my money with other establishments. I think for most people, Sullivan&#39;s will still be a good place to go and have dinner but for me, I want better if I am spending good money."

We had a 7 pm reservation but was not seated until almost 8 pm even though we were on time......The steaks my husband and I got where NOT top notch and they were over cooked.  We have been to best most expensive steakhouses in DT Chicago where a steak was nearly $100, and we didn&#39;t feel no where near as ripped off as we did at Sullivan&#39;s.  Their a&#39; la cart menu mac and cheese tasted terrible, bland and it was small, not like other steak houses where you can at least share some of your food with your spouse.  The manager offered a free meal to have us come back and we gave that free meal to someone else.  Hopefully they like it better than we did."

Honestly, it wasn&#39;t that great.  They had a good waitress before, this time we had a horrible waitress, not only does she need an attitude adjustment, she also needs to smile or at least act like she loves serving....otherwise, she&#39;s int he wrong business of work.

We all ordered steaks, I specifically asked medium well done, well the wait was ridiculous, it took 45 min to get our food on a Thursday night.  I dunno what the hold up was, but that is way too long.  Not only were they late, they had our meals done wrong.  My steak was medium...my friend&#39;s was rare and he asked for medium.  Let&#39;s just say, everything was going wrong and she wasn&#39;t nice to us about it.  We have the right to complain, first she gets our order wrongs and on top of that she is giving us those dirty looks as if we came here on purpose to give her a hard time!

I was completely disappointed, luckily the manager cam out with our food cooked correctly and apologized for everything.  Then I see him go pull her aside and give her some kind of talk (which i hope he told her to get her act together)  We didn&#39;t want to get her in trouble, but our unsatisfactory with our food says enough!

He took an amount our of our paycheck to show his sincere apology."

We were able to get a tall table in the lounge area without any issue, which pleasantly had live music. The staff was friendly, knowledgeable of their menu, and service was fast. The husband ordered the Mac-N-Cheese( shell pasta,creamy and tasty), cream of spinach ( was edible, but the secret ingredient was cumin which was weird for us), and a 12 oz filet mignon(cooked perfectly). I did the $42 prix-fixe with Crispy Shanghai Calamari ( I don&#39;t recommend it, as it was soggy and they poured a sweet and sour sauce on top which made it overly sweet), Shrimp &amp; Lobster Bisque (was lacking on the lobster, plenty of shrimp, and the bisque itself was creamy and light), and 6 oz filet mignon ( also cooked to perfection).

We made reservations here for Thanksgiving Day.  The day before, I get a VM call from &#34;Mallory&#34; confirming our reservations. I returned the call 3X because that&#39;s how many times she hung up on me. Soo frustrating.    On Thanksgiving Day, we valet, and  got seated in the restaurant. Immediately I noticed how inappropriate the waitresses uniforms  were.  They were all wearing skirts that barely covered their @ss. 
Very cheesy for a restaurant that is considered high end.    We were hoping the food was good at least. We were WRONG. We ordered from their special Thanksgiving menu. We had salad, which was ok. But everything else was very forgettable. The Turkey was dry and over processed, stuffing was tasteless and had this gawd awful sausage in it. The sweet potato casserole tasted like pur√©ed baby food.  The cranberry relish was just awful and the Brussels sprouts were way too salty. After leaving our plate half empty, we still held out hope for dessert, which was a pumpkin cheesecake. Can you say baby food once again ?? I think they had a thing about pur√©eing everything. Yuck!!!! Honestly we will probably not even go back here for there everyday menu. The food was terrible. Remember that stuffed feeling u get after a really good Thanksgiving meal?  Nope , didn&#39;t happen here. We got home and the first think I wanted to do was eat!! Next year my husband and I will be cooking our own meal. $39 a person for that mess??? No thanks. Maybe $9.99.  I recommend passing on this restaurant. Overpriced and the quality was not there. To the MANAGER : PLEASE cover up your waitresses!! Not very classy dress at all."

It&#39;s a great deal, and I have always been happy with the food.

For my husband&#39;s birthday dinner, he requested a steakhouse.  So we decided to try out Sullivan&#39;s on Sept. 15.  I actually had pretty low expectations because I find that most of the restaurants in downtown Naperville are disappointingly mediocre.  We were pleasant surprised to have a wonderful dining experience here.  

First of all, we got there early for our reservation but the hostess was able to get us a table right away despite the place being packed.  Then our server, and unfortunately I do not remember her name, was awesome!  She was so outgoing and bubbly and had great recommendations.  And she made us feel special, which is always nice when you are dining out for a special occasion.

The food was really delicious.  We had the shrimp cocktail to start, and my husband had a steak and I had the Hong Kong style sea bass.  Everything was really good.  The waitress recommended a delicious wine, and we were both happy with our drinks throughout the evening.  And the dinner was capped off with a yummy dessert on the house, since it was my husband&#39;s birthday.  Considering we had an appetizer, two entrees, and four drinks between us, the bill, while not small, was still more reasonable than some other steakhouses we have dined in (less than $200).   I would definitely recommend Sullivan&#39;s for a special occasion evening out."

This establishment shows off their best courses upfront.  Fresh bread right out of the oven.  A knockout lettuce wedge salad with bleu cheese dressing.  Creamy, savory lobster bisque.  

The main course was okay.  Both the prime rib and filet could have been more tender, impressive pieces of meat.  The horseradish mashtatoes were delicious, and the mac n cheese was so buttery and heavy, I&#39;d recommend planning on leftovers.  

Dessert was a bit of a disappointment.  Not as fresh as would be expected from a steakhouse like this, the bread puddings and peanut butter pie were alright.  If they were made that day, they were hanging out in the fridge for a long whillllle.  

Expect a dimly light, woody interior and attentive, but not overbearing, service.  The prix fixe options are a good deal: $29 for 3 courses."

We&#39;ve been to the downtown location and the quality of their meat is better.  Here, service is great, but for $200+ per couple, it should be.  We went with the east coast oysters to start and a wedge salad.  I was sad as to the sauces offered with the oysters- nothing special there.  Then I got the mushroom duxelle stuffed filet and two grilled shrimp and the husband went with the dry-aged bone-in ribeye.  Both were just okay (shrimp were great, but pricey at $3 each considering they are just grilled).  No bottle of wine, just a few beers and a cocktail, and it was just over $200.

i certainly would not make the hour drive back out here - especially to battle the ridiculous &#34;downtown&#34; traffic full of pedestrians who walk anywhere they want to whenever they want to."

No where on the website or menu say they use USDA Prime beef. The steak (18 oz bone in KC) did not taste anything like prime at all. In fact, the USDA choice steak that I bought from Jewel and grilled myself tasted a heck a lot better. Furthermore, the portion size is disappointing. I&#39;ve had &#34;18 oz&#34; steaks before and it was a lot bigger than what was offered me. For $42, it was a rip off. No sides or anything either included.

I also tried the crab cake. For $16, I thought I would be getting a decent sized cake with plump, juicy, large chunks of crab meat, just like I&#39;ve had in other places. What was brought to me was a huge disappointment. The size was that of 3 Oreo cookies on top of one another. The taste? well it kinda reminded me of the crab cake I bought at Costco and MICROWAVED myself. 

As for the service, the waiter would honestly disappear on you. While I was looking at the menu, I would ask a question and get no response. Turns out he was gone. I looked like an idiot to the other table. This happened on more than one occasion. No &#34;I&#39;ll be right back&#34; or &#34;while you are looking at that, let me just go grab something.&#34; RUDE!

My tab came to about $75, everything included. Luckily I got a $50 gift card that I never had to chance to use (and was about to expire), so I &#34;only&#34; had to pay $25, and even then I felt ripped off. I&#39;ve been to many steakhouses in many casinos around the country, and I&#39;m not cheap when it comes to fine dining.

Would I ever come here and spend $75 on a meal? NO WAY."

We were seated after waiting 10 minutes for a 5:00 reservation. The place was empty. Not sure why the wait. We ordered drinks. They were fine. The waiter also acknowledged it was my birthday and he had a dessert for me. We ordered the price fixe strip steaks, and my daughter had the filet. They came with an appetizer and soup. The bisque soup was at most luke warm. All steaks were ordered medium rare. The waiter reviewed each order as to what medium rare meant. We each nodded yes. Dinner was served. Mine was so well done there wasn&#39;t even a hint of pink. The other two were cooked fine. But the steaks were tough and barely chewable and extremely salty.

We had two drinks each at the bar, like $35 rounds.  Finally, over an hour later, we were seated.  Both Katie and Jermiah were our servers, kind of tag teaming the table.  Very nice, very attentive, maybe even too attentive.  We ordered meatballs as an appetizer, which was ok, not fab.  Ordered a bottle of wine, four steak entrees with sides. Steak was great with the bordelaise sauce, omg.  The asparagus was cooked perfectly, the cheddar potatoes au gratin were good.  Manager Randy came by to check on us, apologetic for the wait (without us saying anything until he asked).  He ended up comping a few things and really made the experience even better.  I would definitely recommend this place, I would come here again.  It is pretty pricey, so expect to spend a good amount of money.

I popped my bagel in the toaster oven.  And then I forgot about it.  I reluctantly grabbed my purse and headed for the door.  Where to?

It was just past noon and I wanted a replacement bagel.  Panera&#39;s parking lot would surely be a madhouse.  Defeated, I decided to grab some food at whatever was closest to the office, which meant Portillo&#39;s.  But their drive-thru line that time of day is about as long as a line giving out free Justin Bieber tickets.

Arby&#39;s?  Okay, well, I haven&#39;t been in awhile.  And when they closed the one off of Route 59 and 111th Street, I was one of those people who complain about the closing of a place I don&#39;t dine.  I hate those people.  So I went to Arby&#39;s, that way I can complain when they close.  Because at least I&#39;d have eaten there recently.  They&#39;ve been closing a lot of locations, so I doubt this one will be open much longer.  There is too much competition in the area.

I ordered a beef &#39;n cheddar with some homestyle fries.  The curly fries are seasoned fries that remind me of my high school cafeteria, and my hands stink when I&#39;m done eating them, so I avoid these even though they&#39;re probably what Arby&#39;s is most known for aside from the beef.  Oh yeah, and I got some horsey sauce on the side.  I&#39;ve heard so many remarks throughout the years about how gross this stuff is.  No way, it&#39;s horseradish sauce and makes everything on the menu taste better.

I was starving, so I ate fast and forgot to put the sauce on my sandwich, which was noticeably dry.  Why do I have to keep asking, &#34;where&#39;s my cheese?&#34; usually I have to be careful about these sandwiches, the cheese and sauce can get a little messy.  Sandwich was dry overall.  My fries were super hot and fresh though.

There is little wait in the drive-thru line any time of day.  Sometimes it takes awhile to actually receive your food, but that depends what you order.

Is Arby&#39;s &#34;good mood food&#34; like the slogan goes?  Well, I&#39;m in an OK mood.  I&#39;ve got time to kill on Yelp and want to start a pool on when this location will finally close its doors."

The restaurant is typical fast food restaurant:  mostly clean, nothing exciting, etc.   They have the Coca Cola Freestyle machines, which to me are nice but un-necessary.  This place, in general, needs to get over it&#39;s pretentiousness.  It&#39;s very similar to an In N Out Burger in terms of menu options and quality.   However their pricing is out of line to me for fast food.   $14+ for a double cheeseburger (maybe 0.33 lb patties total), small fries &amp; large drink??  C&#39;mon now.   Granted, the burger and fries are both very good, fresh made to order and larger than average fast food joint, but it&#39;s just excessive.  In N Out can offer a very similar experience for nearly half the cost.   Bottom line here is it&#39;s a quality meal, but some sticker shock involved hre.    There are cheeseburger options that are just as good and filling for less money in the area (Meatheads,Culvers,  Portillos, etc).    Makes me long for In N Out to be out here in the MIdwest."

I&#39;m not a raving maniac about animal rights, burgers just ain&#39;t my thang.  Understand?

Anyway, we ordered 2 burgers and fries.  The guy behind the counter recommended we order 1 large fries, instead of 2 regulars.  Fries are my thang.  I love potatoes and carbs and fries, so I generally do not like to share.  However, this was an awesome recommendation, because we saved a few bucks, and the large fries were more than enough for us to share.  

There are a lot of toppings to choose from, and they don&#39;t charge extra for every little thing.  Mustard, giardinera, tomato, etc.  If you just want a burger patty with cheese, it might not be worth your money.  

This is another of those &#34;gourmet&#34; fast food burger joints, so don&#39;t expect to get a deal here.  Good for an occasional quick dinner if you&#39;re running errands in the area.

Speaking of the area, this spot is littered with teenagers since Neuqua Valley High School is right around the corner.  

Also, there are peanuts all over the place and shells on the floor.  I love me some free peanuts, but if you have allergies you may want to avoid this place."

We went to this FIVE GUYS yesterday for lunch we liked it. But somehow I found a long piece of light color hair in our fries. We were hungry and I didn&#39;t want to cause drama so I just let it go. We have black hair so we know it wasn&#39;t our hair. Plus I pulled it out among the mountain of fries we got from our order. I mean it is the same Five Guys flavor and mountain of fries but whenever you hair in your food it is a turn off.

On the whole, I&#39;ve had better burgers but my cheeseburger was good.  I&#39;ve had better fries (I tried Five Guys and Cajun and liked both) but they were some of the best I&#39;ve had...I&#39;ve never had so many Coke choices (I tried Vanilla Barqs, Peach Sprite, Cherry, Orange and Raspberry Coke) and that was really why I went! 
We thought our service was polite and fast...it was all good the one detail that makes me hold back stars is the price!! I had a small drink, &#34;regular&#34; (which I&#39;ll admit was a LOT) fry order and a small hamburger and I spent over $10.  
Maybe I&#39;m spoilt but I think that&#39;s kind of high for one fast food meal...but I&#39;ll probably go back because of the siren song of flavored drinks! :)"

 Food was very very good... we started with the onion rings, probably the best I personally have ever had. Chicken tortilla soup was full of flavor,  not salt. She had the half slab of ribs, I have the Monte Cristo, both were fantastic! Red rice and beans was our choice for side... can&#39;t beat it.

First time here! Service a bit slow but what do you expect when you&#39;re with a huge party right?
Their flavored teas are bomb dot com!
I got the mango and my husband got the peach.
You can even request to get half and half.
I prefer the mango over the peach because mango is not as sweet.
Their flavored tea was honestly what stood out to me during my dining experience here - but its just that good.

Got the tortilla soup - and it was just okay.
Trying to eat healthy so got the sweet chilli chicken and shrimp combo which comes with rice and veggies.
The chicken was very tender and the sauce was just a bit of kick with a bit of sweetness. Shrimp was mediocre. Rice was such a small portion lol - but ya know this is the healthy option.

My husband ordered the BBQ Back Ribs, I ordered the Salmon and our daughter ordered Lemon Pepper Chicken. My salmon was supposed to come with rice &amp; broccoli, all fresh made. I could tell the broccoli had been frozen (actually my daughter also had the broccoli and could tell too) and the serving portions were the tiniest I have ever seen. There was literally a spoonful of rice hidden under my fish. It was at the most a couple of bites worth.  

Same with my husbands rice and all of our veges. We ate everything on our plates and joked that we would have to eat again when we got home. My husband mentioned that he ordered a FULL rack but only had maybe a half.

This wouldn&#39;t be my usual choice, but since we had a large party (6 adults/3 kids) with children we were sort of pigeonholed into going here.
     It was more crowded than I had expected for a Sunday at 3:30, and it took a while to get seated.  We were finally seated at a pair of tables in the back.  After a few minutes our waiter came out and took our drink orders.  Moments later, our drinks arrived and we placed our food orders.  While waiting for our food, we noticed that we had never been given place settings.  When our food was brought out (Our server mistakenly gave me another persons sandwich), we addressed this with our waiter, who said that our silverware and napkins would be brought right out.  After several minutes of waiting, our utensils were finally brought out.
     I tried a maple bacon and chicken sandwich, that was dry and a bit too tough.  Everyone else&#39;s food seemed to be meh.  Which was expected considering how basic there menu was.  Unfortunately, this places ship was sunk long before the food arrived.  There simply isn&#39;t an excuse for all the mistakes that were made here.  Especially considering we were the largest table in this servers section (i.e., his biggest potential tip).

Their alcoholic beverages are DELICIOUS!!!!!  Their margaritas are fabulous and strong. They make a drink that you can only order two of because it&#39;s so strong but you&#39;d never guess it because it&#39;s that good. 
My only complaint is that the service is hot or miss. I&#39;ve been there on two occasions where I swear the server forgot us, we waited so long for her to come back. Both times we have notified management and they always take care of us.

Everything else I tried was a miss.

I remember Cheddars from when I lived in Newport News, Virginia when I was in the military. Cheddars and Red Lobster were regular dining options...Looking back how did I ever eat that crap?! It&#39;s so nasty! 

I wanted a better option than the usual suspects of fast food (Mc Donald&#39;s, Taco Bell, Burger King) but also something cheap and quick...I was trying to get in and out of iKea and this is what I came up with.

I had the blackened salmon, broccoli casserole (burnt cheese and sticky rice) and the &#34;homemade&#34; macaroni &amp; cheese with &#34;crusted top&#34;....


Hmmmm... For starters I don&#39;t know why I ordered something with so much processed &#34;cheese&#34;, it sorta defeated my whole purpose and intentions for what to eat. 

But anyway it was disgusting and I didn&#39;t eat it. 

This place might be good for a burger and fries but much else."

Came in Sunday evening at about 530-6pm, the place was swarming with patrons. It was a short wait of 15-20 mins for 2 ppl per the hostess who never took our names. We walked slightly to the left to the bar 2 get a drink while we waited. The bar was pretty busy as well. The bartender seemed overwhelmed, but she was really nice and trying as best she could. We ordered drinks which came fast. The painkiller was a good drink 2 try. Pretty large too for only $6.99. I had 2. We ordered a philly cheese sandwhich and buffalo chicken tenders. Took our food about 30 mins to come out. We got 2 listen to all the pick up customers complain about orders being messed up or not ready when they arrived. Then a drunkard came in griping about their choice of television. GREAT SCENE... Fast fwd food comes and my philly is good, although it looks like a chopped hamburger on a french bread roll. But it was good so I won&#39;t complain. My friend said her tenders weren&#39;t cooked properly &amp; she sent them back (how the hell do you screw those up). Another 15 mins passes, tenders come back &amp; sge still isn&#39;t happy, but keeps them. While she eats I visit the bathroom (my friend has already warned me its NOT CLEAN). I go in and it has stinky closed up smell like the ventilation is bad. It&#39;s 2 trash cans overflowing with napkins and trash. Go back out &amp; request the check, my friend notices that she&#39;s charged twice for the tenders!!!! We tell the bartender and she removes it after saying most people don&#39;t catch it. (WHAT THE HELL????) They desperately need help in the kitchen and a customer service course. Not a bad place, but I&#39;d probably never go back. I don&#39;t live in the area and not that great to drive 45mins away."

Chicken tenders were meaty and juicy...breading could use some seasoning...Id love to see some assortment offered...like...Cajun seasoning, etc

I had their Monte Cristo and it was DELICIOUS! Their coleslaw is OUTSTANDING! If you love KFC and Red Lobster Coleslaw...this is like a marriage of the two flavors!

We both ordered bowls of loaded baked potato soup and asked if they had bread, strange, they dont, you have to order croissants with honey butter which come in an order of 3 for 2.99$ which seems kind of high to me. But back to the soup, the waitress comes back to the table states that the soup will be about 5 to 10 minutes wait she&#39;s soooo sorry, we tell her  it&#39;s ok we will wait, she brings out the croissants while we wait, there&#39;s barely any honey butter on them not really worth the price if you ask me, but we nibble on them waiting for the soup. It finally comes out almost 20 minutes later cold as ice. We send it back while she apologizes again. I asked for napkins she said she would bring them. We order our entrees, I order spicy mango chili chicken and shrimp on a bed of rice with a side salad, I substituted ranch dressing for the tomato vinigrette they use, he ordered the half slab of ribs and grilled shrimp combo with a loaded baked potato and red beans and rice for the sides. We ended up getting our entrees before we got our soups back. Shes still didnt bring napkins had to ask yet again.They didn&#39;t substitute the ranch dressing for the other dressing like I asked, had to ask again. They fixed it. She finally brought out napkins after having to ask 3 times. She never asked if we wanted refills for our drinks we had to ask. The potato soup was good when we finally got it. The mango chili sauce was good on my entree sweet and spicy, the chicken was cooked perfect, not dry, barely any rice, 2 spoonful at most, half of it was undercooked, crunchy, one of my shrimps wasn&#39;t even cleaned it still had the vein in it which is absolutely DISGUSTING BECAUSE THAT IS SH*T.  I would have expected at least the soup to be taken off of the bill or something due to the inconvenience of it arriving after the entrees, but no nothing. And then the waitress has the nerve to ask me if I want change back on a 43 bill from 60$ like do you really think I&#39;m going to leave you that big of a tip after the type of service I just received? I don&#39;t think so!!! I should have left you a big fat 000000!"

It took us over an hour to get our food.   Our server was very lackadaisical about us not getting our food in a timely fashion.  He was never apologetic about the lateness of our food.  A server came out and said she  needed to retake our order without telling us who, what, why or how.
After that I had to ask for a manager which I shouldn&#39;t have to do.   A manager should have come to explain the issue and offer a solution automatically. 
When the bill came it was still wrong as there were items on the menu I asked for but never got.  Now a 2nd manager comes to explain the issue again.
If you kept track that is 4 employees coming to our table to provide a subpar explanation of our poor service.
Then the excuse is the litchen is slow.

We had the dessert shots, just a taste for everyone, which was enjoyable and not too much after the meal.

Some nights the food is great and satisfying and other nights it&#39;s just not the greatest. On a bad night the food is TOO SALTY...to the point it is not edible. 

The steak dinner when cooked properly is tasty and very well priced. The Santa Fe spinach dip is great! The Bourbon dipping sauce is so &#34;lick your fingers&#34; good...lol. Be sure to try the croissants, they are delicious!! 

I always get the grilled chicken plate have tried 2 of them, and again, on a good day it&#39;s tasty and on a bad day, dry and salty. I have also had the Tilapia dinner which wasn&#39;t too bad.

I have never been before and I thought it was a pretty restaurant. The hostess was lukewarm but maybe that was due to rainy day doldrums. 

Our server Paige was really nice and friendly. I guess unlike others experiences she checked in to see how we were enjoying our meal and needed anything else. All in all I think she did a good job.

I had the Grilled Tilapia. It was good on the meaty part, dry &amp; over cooked on the thin part. Tilapia can be hard to cook &amp; this is not a seafood restaurant so I won&#39;t fault them for that.

Sooooooooo I take 3 stars off because of:

I do fault them for heavy on the sodium. WOW! I am gonna be a Good Year Blimp tomorrow from the amount of salt on the fish. I am so glad that I am not on a salt restricted diet where this would adversely affect my health. I just don&#39;t use a ton of salt as I prefer to taste my food. Most resturants under salt and therefore you can add accordingly to taste hence the salt shaker or in Cheddar&#39;s a Salt Lick.

The sides. SERIOUSLY... The only healthy option is broccoli??? I can&#39;t get plain corn or green beans or baked potato??? &amp; if I want to just do a salad instead of the sides I get charged extra???

I probably will never eat here again just because of the upcharge for a side salad while eschewing the 2 sides.

When she drank half the cup and couldn&#39;t finish the rest  (and usually she finishes it), I was curious and took a sip then noticed a funky taste and smell, initially i thought it was spiked, but when I called the manager and asked him to smell the orange juice, he said it was spoiled. He said he was very sorry. He did not refund the juice, and he did not do anything to assure me that this mistake would not happen again. How many adults order orange juice? I can&#39;t imagine how many children have gotten sick from drinking the orange juice here.

This past trip was probably my last. 

I ordered bread pudding, 20 minutes later still not at the table. The waitress brought the check to the table, no bread pudding on the check or at the table..... I guess she just forgot?! I didn&#39;t have time to wait another 20 minutes for it to be ready.. So we paid and left."

I should&#39;ve known it wasn&#39;t going to go well when I called 2 days ago to make reservations. I called on a Thurs night to reserve a table for 10 on Saturday. After sitting on hold for over 5 minutes the host came back on the line to say they were completely booked on Sat &#34;but call back on Fri because there&#39;s a good chance something will open up&#34; huh? Ok, so I called on Fri morning and got a table for 10, no problem. Upon arrival I checked in with the host and I was told they were getting the table ready. After waiting for 15 minutes, I went back up to ask how much longer and she said oh, follow me. So the table was ready, but she didn&#39;t want to let us know that. Huh?? We were seated, drink orders taken. 15 minutes later we get our non-alcohol drinks. Ordering with our server was probably the most painful experience. She was clueless!! And the way she would repeat our orders was completely confusing. She would confirm and repeat what we ordered, but then repeat it a 2nd time but rephrased making everyone question if they ordered right the first time. One of the kids in our party ordered mac &amp; cheese from the kids menu and got the smallest portion ever. We asked our server if it was the kids size, she said no, it was just a side. No attempt to rectify the situation. Then while a few of us were still working on our entrees the server asked if we wanted desert. At that point I kinda snapped and asked her to wait until everyone was finished with their entrees before taking desert orders. I had had enough at that point. 

Our entire experience was extremely frustrating! Comical and unbelievable at times, but mostly frustrating. I regret leaving a 20% tip. She didn&#39;t deserve it at all. Wish I would&#39;ve gotten her name. She had bright red hair though.

First and last time for us at Cheddar&#39;s, Bolingbrook."

It used to be my in-laws&#39; favorite place to eat before the chain dried up. And the first time they took me there I was an immediate fan.

A few years ago we discovered that the last of a dying species was right down the road from us in Bolingbrook. But...things weren&#39;t the same.

There&#39;s one amazing dish on the menu that I&#39;ve never been able to go wrong with. The cajun pasta. It&#39;s perfect every time. The right spices, the right amount of food, a really nice meat to pasta ratio. It&#39;s right on the money.

Last night I tried the ribs and they were pretty darn good too. Not quite BBQ restaurant worthy, but I&#39;m used to the dry, meatless sticks they shove your way at Chili&#39;s. These were meaty, well-cooked, and fall-off-the-bone tender. The sauce was not bad, but nothing remarkable.

A few stinkers I&#39;ve had: 
Spasagna. WTF. Gross. 
Chicken tenders. More greasy batter than chicken. 
Pot roast, which was like shoe leather bathed in way too much onion powder. 

One thing I miss is Cheddar&#39;s signature cheddar cheese soup. None of the soups they serve here compare, and they&#39;re all kind of icky. The baked potato soup wasn&#39;t done enough. The potato chunks were undercooked and hard. And the tortilla soup is watery and lacks substance. 

I&#39;m not complaining. I&#39;ve found things I like, and each time we receive terrific service. In fact, if I had to choose between Cheddar&#39;s and another similar establishment like Chilis or Applebees, I&#39;d choose Cheddar&#39;s every time."

First, the restaurant was packed at 9:30pm. Like wait to be seated packed. I looked over the menu when I was waiting to be seated and was struck by how cheap everything was and I was wondering why. I thought for sure it would be a hastily thrown together meal full of cheap ingredients and shortcuts. But I was willing to take a chance. 

Most drinks were about $4. I opted for a slightly higher end cocktail and it was still only $6.25. Very good and very strong. 

The server didn&#39;t push us to order any appetizers, which I really appreciated. I had this Lemon Pepper Whitefish and it was really, really good and substantial.  Also only 480 calories. I think it was $8


As far as I&#39;m concerned, there&#39;s never a reason to go to a Chilis or Applebee&#39;s again as long as this place is around.   It&#39;s a very well run and tasty place to eat"

After being seated it took over 20 minutes to be greeted by our server. I had to ask the the manager for this to occur. More on him later. We were a table of 8. The drink order was taken and 15 minutes later they arrived. We were ready to order apps. The waiter wasn&#39;t. I&#39;ll be right back he said. 10 min. We order apps. In 25 minutes they arrived. Sigh...  Ordered the main courses. The waiter never checked to see if things were going smoothly. After we finished the apps it took just over 30 more minutes for the food to arrive. I ordered the chicken fried chicken.. Big mistake. The gravy was room temperature and the taste was just plain bland. No seasoning what so ever. Not once did the waiter check on us. When he finally showed up near the end my family member asked for a take home container, that request was never answered, prompting me to speak with the manager. I forgot to mention that the few times I spoke with our server C.J was his name if I recall, he called me boss. Sure thing boss. Pure trash and very unprofessional. I tell the manager about all of the problems and he does absolutely nothing to remedy the stuation. No money off. Just plain nothing. I&#39;ll have you remember this was Christmas eve. The final cherry on top was when C.J was saying his parting words after he&#39;d been paid. And I quote &#34;It&#39;s familys like you that make me proud I served in the military&#34; Gag!!! We will never set foot near this place again. We&#39;d rather starve than be subjected to a manager as bad as they had that night and a careless server who calls you boss. I hope if C.J. was indeed in the military it was as an cook because I wouldn&#39;t trust him to get my food let alone protect our country..."

Other &#34;pros&#34; include the inexpensive menu (most entrees were less than $10), and the endless drink menu.  

Cheddar&#39;s is a cross between a greasy diner and a family chain restaurant.  It lacks the &#34;cool&#34; of TGI Friday&#39;s, but it lacks the funeral home carpet of most Greek diners.  Lack of identity, check.

In the past, I&#39;ve had the chicken tender platter, which my dining partner agreed was just as good as Chili&#39;s.  The fries aren&#39;t anything special, and they were borderline cold.  Our waitress was really weird and she rubbed me the wrong way. I ordered water, and her reply was, &#34;come on girl, water?! It&#39;s the weekend!&#34;  I couldn&#39;t tell by her tone how she meant it.  She made an equally awkward comment after we declined ordering dessert.  It came off as blatant tip sniffing.  When she dropped the check, I wanted to leave right away, she didn&#39;t seem cool with anyone sitting and chatting.

It appears to be popular with locals, and they probably get some business from travelers being right off of I-55.  Cheddar&#39;s is on my list for my next Monte Cristo craving.  I&#39;d probably sit at the bar in hopes of avoiding that awkward waitress as well."

The prices were Awesome. For starters, My wife and I ordered some of their yummy Honey Buttered Croissants...OMG fresh from the oven and Oh so good! the sweet, butteriness of the glaze along with the buttery, flakiness of the pastry were perfect compliments....Butter with butter.... sounds like a winning combination to me! At $2.49 for 3, it was a little more than I would expect to pay for bread ....but the taste was so good, I didn&#39;t mind so much.

MY wife order a Cheddars sampler platter which contained, Chicken Tenders, Cheese sticks, potato skins, and something else I can&#39;t remember. I ordered the fried catfish platter. Great portion size, food all came out hot and was flavored well. THE ONION RINGS ARE GOOODDDDDD!!!!!

In all, to have gotten all that food (plus meals for our kids, who thoroughly enoyed themselves) with a check that ended up UNDER $30, we were pretty darned happy to say the least!

The food I ordered was way below standard in my opinion. I had a salad with lettuce that was just too old to be served. It was browning and had sat in a bag way too long. The chicken pot pie was mediocre with a crust that was not fully baked. The filling was standard like you would get if you bought a chicken pot pie at the grocery store. The mini desserts we ordered were mostly graham cracker crumbs and very little pudding and /or fruit.  Sorry but I will come back to this establishment.

If you&#39;re a long time fan of this place, I do have to say that the portion for the chicken tender platter has been cut in half from years ago.  I used to split this meal with a second person or take half home.  Today I finished everything, a little sad that I don&#39;t have leftovers."

Service seemed disorganized, we were seated near the kitchen and heard dishes fall and break multiple times, and the food was lacking. 

It took more than ten minutes to put in our drink orders and receive our drinks. We got our appetizers but didn&#39;t have silverware. Then the silverware rolls we received were missing knives. My salad order was wrong but I ate it anyway. Our server, although pleasant seemed overwhelmed and we didn&#39;t want to bother her.

Then after receiving our entrees, it took some time before the server came and checked on our satisfaction. Unfortunately I found some rice in my side of corn and my loaded baked potato had a piece of chopped apple in it. When I told the server, she did alert the manager on duty. The manager came to our table shortly. She offered to replace the two sides, and I agreed that would be fine. However when the new side of corn came, it STILL had rice mixed in it and the new baked potato was completely underdone. I would have expected the manager to check the pot of corn to ensure that other patrons would not have the same issue, but that does not seem to be the case. 

Our server did not ask about the replaced items, and the manager did not check in to see if the situation had been rectified. The whole experience was unappetizing and disappointing to say the least. The quality of the food, level of service, and overall value left much to be desired."

The pure and simple fact being that we never got a table because of the incompetent management staff who is unable to manage high volume traffic, their own staff, and manage expectations. 

We had never been here and thought it would a good meeting place,as my family lives in opposite directions. Exactly 1 hour in the middle. I called ahead to see if they could accomodate a party of 9 - 3 small children. Manager Mike gave me his word. He made it seem like they could handle a  big party in their sleep. I trusted him because A) he is a manager B) this is chain restaurant, how hard can it be.

We put our name in a 5 pm (which is a very early dinner time if you ask me) We were told it would be about an hour because 2 8-tops were just seated right before us.Oooookkkkkkayyyyy... Im thinking &#34;gee you can only accomate 2 parties of 8 at per time.&#34; MGR Mike reassured me this earlier in the day via phone &#34;This is a big restaurant we can surely accomodate&#34; 

Wellllll we waited 45 minutes. My 11 month old was belly up to the bar, and an hour past his normal dinner time and while we were able to entertain him and seemed happy, my gut as a mother was starting to tell me this is wrong. 

The 16 year old hostess did not give us a pager, not sure she even got our names. So I went and check at the hostess stand after 45 minutes of waiting. 

Me, &#34;Any clue how much longer it&#39;s going to be for our table?&#34; 
hostess &#34;ummmm I told you guys I didnt know, we will call you when it&#39;s ready&#34; me &#34;well I need to know that a table is gauranteed to us within the next 15 minutes or we will be leaving&#34; 
hostess &#34; I dont know what you want me to do?&#34; 
Me &#34;well then...I guess take our name off the list, bye&#34; 
***PLEASE NOTE: Manager Mike was standing behind Princess hostess the entire time, never interjected. NEVER APOLOGIZED.****

AFTER we paid our tab at the bar (YES THEY STILL MADE $$ OFF OF US/never offered to comp anything) We started to pack up. Manager mike came over (VERY DEFENSIVE, Unapologetic, No solution to the problem) Wanted to &#34;hear our side&#34; I explained the above again. STILL NO APOLOGY. I reminded him of the phone call that took place earlier in the day. OOOOOH YESSSS HE REMEMBERED. What was his response to all of this??? &#34;I TOLD YOU ON THE PHONE THERE WOULD BE A WAIT&#34; 

Now ...correct me if i&#39;m wrong, we waited an hour for a table, a restaurant that could only accomodate 2 large parties at a time. We had 3 small children. HERE IS MY SOLUTION after working in the customer service industry for many, many years. Would it have been wrong for the manager to??? 1)apologize right up front, 2) say please choose 2 or 3 appetizer from our menu &#34;ON US&#34; to help keep your kids from getting crabby and hungry and 3) we will work very hard to get you a table as quickly as possible?  We value your business!

This could have been a place my family would meet at for years to come, creating repeat business, sadly we wasted to much of our evening at this dump."

When I asked for the manager the woman came to the table and could not stop laughing she was very unprofessional and head embarrassed the waitress.

I recently picked up an order for takeout that included a chicken tender salad and a Caesar salad. While eating the Caesar salad, I noticed a giant black spot in my food. Upon closer expection I found it was a piece of dirt about the size of an orange seed. I probably called the restaurant to voice my concerns and to notify them of the issue so other customers wouldn&#39;t be exposed to the same health exposure.

Needless to say I spoke with the manager and she didn&#39;t sound too impressed or enthused enough to look further into the matter. She then admitted that they often will wash their salad produce in large batches and will use that to serve multiple people which actually sounds worse since all the other customers may be eating the same dirt. She did apologize and then offer that if I drive all the way back to the restaurant (approximately 30 minute drive) that she would give me a free dessert and replace my salad. 

Overall it was a very halfhearted attempt to try to appease me. Granted I trying not to really push for more since I was just trying to notify the manager would react to a significant problem with their quality control. I would think very hard about eating at the restaurant again and would also caution any of my friends and family to visit the restaurant too."

I have to say I can dig this scene now.  

Although the face of the building was spiffily updated, the interior was relatively the same.  We were seated immediately, and the rest of the patrons were office personnel enjoying some post-work libations, so it was rather noisy, no matter where you were seated.  Our server was quick, but seemed very crabby.

We started with a spinach dip appetizer, a raspberry pear margarita, and a strawberry lemonade.  The spinach dip was out of this world!  A large, hot, cheesy portion, and getting extra tortilla chips for it (free of charge) was a snap.  As an added bonus, the margarita was fruity and strong.  For an entree, I was going to order a burger, but after reading in the menu they only cook their burgers medium or above, I opted out.  I&#39;m a rare meat kind of girl, and like a juicy burger, not a dried out one, which is what medium means to me.  So I chose the catfish dinner.  The entree was really not all that good.  The fish was not very fresh with a rubbery texture.  For desert, I wanted to try the red velvet cake mini ( little cake deserts served in shot glassed- for .99 apiece, you can&#39;t pass these up,) but the waitress came back to tell me they no longer carry that variety.  I had the yet-to-be-advertised strawberry shortcake one instead, and it was just perfect!

I could see myself coming back for drinks and apps, but I really would suggest skipping out on the entrees.  Also, prices, even on the alcohol, are more than reasonable."

They were crispy and stacked tall. Served with a ranch and a spicy dipping sauces. For the entrees, order a steak and rib combo with a baked potato and buttered corn. And, order a steak and chicken tender combo with brocolli cheese casserole and mashed potatos. The steak were seasoned well and cooked to temp (medium). The ribs (half slab) were hot, lightly sauced and pretty tasty. The chicken tenders were really good large pieces, well seasoned breading and fries (nice and crispy) served with honey mustard dipping sauce. All the sides were well prepared and seasoned properly.

   Well, I&#39;ll go through our dishes; the fish tacos were very good with lots of flavor(fried and blackened), my son enjoyed his 1/2 lb bacon cheeseburger which was huge, my daughter enjoyed her citrus miso glazed salmon over ginger rice(I thought the salmon was overcooked),blackend catfish was pretty good(not completely convinced it was catfish), ribs fell off the bone, but maybe had been sitting around(this was late lunch)my loaded baked potato was so overcooked( has to be from yesterday).
     Service was friendly. Altogether, I don&#39;t think we will return as we have lots of choices for dining in this area."

It happened Cheddar&#39;s was directly in front of us and we decided...why not?  The place was packed.  There was a very boisterous and diverse crowd of predominantly families.  It had the feel of your typical family chain restaurant with a couple of really cool touches (giant leaf like fans in the atrium).  We settled into our booth and started looking around.  The chicken tenders looked great.  That was enough for us, we both ordered them.  They came out fresh and our server accidentally dropped one on the tray and she immediately apologized and said she would bring a new one.  We had a replacement in the blink of an eye.  I really liked that she was upfront and quick about the whole thing...extra points!  Also, at one point the manager came over and refilled our drinks to help out the very busy waitresses, I really took note of that as well.  Back to the food, everything was fresh and tasty, the serving size was huge and so were the tenders.  I ended up bringing half of mine home.  The reason I am going four stars here is because most of the time when a visit a chain restaurant I go in with low expectations for both the food and service.  This location of Cheddar&#39;s completely exceeded my expectations.  Both the service and cook staff really have it together and provide a great experience.  If I am in the area again I would definitely go back for some more of those delicious tenders!"

I think her name was Cassie. My husband got the chicken and shrimp and had no complaints. He loves the chicken strips. I had fish tacos with black beans and they were fantastic. I ordered a side salad as well because 2 tacos didn&#39;t sound like enough food, but I was wrong. No need for the side salad next time. We also love the cocktails there, specifically the Texas Sweet Tea and the Texas Margarita."

The moment we walked in, our hostess was very friendly and asked if it was too cold inside. The food is ridiculously affordable for how good it is and how much food they give you. The service is another great thing to be mentioned! Our waitress was so nice and always made sure to check on us plenty, but not an obnoxious amount of times. The general manager even came out during our meal to ask how everything was for us, which is always a nice way to make your customers feel cared about! I would recommend this place to everyone looking for great service and yummy food at a great price."

Olive Garden-REAL shite. OK, a few are alright-Outback &amp; Carraba&#39;s can be really good. Houlihans is overpriced, but it can have its moments. Find my review of Golden Corral here on Yelp. Across the street from our local Golden Corral is a CHEDDARS store, which we have been looking at for years, never stepping inside. Our distrust of chains insured it. Then I saw Cheddars was listed as the best of all chains by Consumer Reports. Well worth a try, I figgered.
The ambiance is upscale for a chain, and I thought that we would be in Houlhan&#39;s territory-that this was a Denny&#39;s for the Horsey set. Looked liek it was going to be toffee-nosed and pricey.
Wrong.
I thought they gave me a trick menu. The prices were stupid low, for what looked like good chow.
Wife ordered some shrimps and I ordered a Burger. Both were great. Also got some Potato Skins.  All very very good.
Fine service, although the nite we were there-all the waitrons looked like the same girl. I saw a few of them standing together, and they all looked alike! Weird!
We&#39;ve been back a few times. Repeat visits have proved this is a chain not worthy of the &#34;chain&#34; stigma. None of this food is revolutionary, they ain&#39;t breaking no new ground. It IS prepared fine, and at stone bargain prices.
A decent place to go eat..."

To me that is the test of a good eatery. I was eyeing the club sandwich and asked if it were possible to add eggs to it. I was told in no uncertain terms by the waitress that they do not have any eggs and the egg beaters they have are just enough to support the menu items they go into. I have had this done in other restaurants that were considered lower brow than this so I was not sure what the big deal was. Coming from a European affected background,  a club sandwich is SUPPOSED to have eggs I don&#39;t know why Americans don&#39;t seem to get that!

She was such a sweetheart and good with young kids. Staff like her is what will get them repeat business. Ask for Monse (Mun-SAY). My boy had kids cheese burger with yogurt apples daughter had noodles with butter and garlic bread. She didn&#39;t want marinara on them.  I had buffalo chicken wrap but opted for chicken tenders and wife had something... Can&#39;t remember. Everyone cleared their plates but I didn&#39;t. Loaded fries with ranch we good too.

Husband and I had a few things to do in Joliet so we stopped into Tin Roof. I&#39;ve been wanting to go here for quite awhile now but we just haven&#39;t had a chance. I am SO glad we did! 

We got there about 3:00. There was one other table seated so it was relatively empty. The waitress was quick to greet us and took our drink order right away. We had already looked at the menu online so we were ready to rock. 

We both started with the cream of potato soup. Do yourself a favor and get some. This soup was so flavorful. I&#39;m not normally a huge soup person but had a friend recommend the soup at Tin Roof so we took a chance. It was one of the highlights of lunch. 

If you are going to visit Tin Roof you need to get yourself the fried bacon. This app was just the bomb. They serve it with a side of ranch as well as a side of syrup so you kind of have to figure out which one you want. You can&#39;t go wrong either way. Yum!

We then both had the angus burger with bacon. It&#39;s served on a pretzel bun. They cooked it perfectly and served it with an order of steak fries. Perfection. 

If you are in the downtown J stop in. You won&#39;t regret it!"

Waited for two hours for my salmon to come out. Thirty minutes for an appetizer, twenty minutes for cocktails. When we walked in there&#39;s a bar that greets you but no real hostess to seat you in the dining room. We had to fetch the waitress who wasn&#39;t very friendly and seemed frustrated and over worked. Turn off. Especially since this was our first time here. She then just told us to go pick a table.
I ordered the  ceviche, very tasty, chips were fresh and were sprinkled with seasoning. I ordered a spicy Thai chilli daiquiri called &#34;something&#34; Hobbes. It was too sour, overkill on alcohol and had no spice to it as listed. I added sugar and squeezed the lime it came with to make it drinkable. Once again no waitress for a long time as we wanted to order and get some water. I ordered the salmon, it was pretty delicious I must admit, so many flavors in this dish. But again, one waitress for the whole dining room is unacceptable. She gave us the impression that she wanted us to get our own stuff including buss our own table. FYI, drink list is for stiff drinks. Also the vibe was very Debbie Downerish.......could be improved though, decor is cool, but this is no place to sit at the bar and enjoy drinks because it&#39;s dry.

We ordered tacos, the Gavel chicken sandwich, and soup. They were excellent. The chicken sandwich was a slight bit greasy, but quite frankly it was extremely tasty.

The steak fries are excellent, a bit spicy if you are expecting bland. But the Cajun spices on them are excellent.

I would absolutely eat here again. The food and service was excellent. This would be a great place to take a date or to bring a group of adults. I might bring my family but my girls are older."

However in the past year service has gone down. The drinks we used to order are no longer order-able and our favored Cuban sandwich is no longer on the menu (they made it for us &#34;off menu&#34; but it was sub par compared to when we used to order). We can no longer get the cheesecake bites either :(
The deep fried bacon is fabulous and the rest of the drinks are very good. It&#39;s a neat place for being in Joliet and we don&#39;t have to travel far. The other menu items are very good as well. They need to work on service in the restaurant and up keep quality though."

Until recently, my answer would have been, &#34;I don&#39;t go to dinner in Joliet. Ever. At least not on purpose&#34;

But, we get older, we get wiser, we try new things. And one of those new things is Tin Roof....which absolutely, positively deserves four stars.

First (as usual if you know me) the COCKTAILS are fantastically creative. My favorite was Brothers in Arms because you can&#39;t go wrong with a drink that has Tequila, Mezcal, AND Cachaca in it. And hellfire. Yup, it has hellfire in the drink. What&#39;s hellfire? Who knows.......but the drink was great.

Apps included Mango Grilled Shrimp and also Ceviche &amp; Chips. Loved them both.

Devoured an open-face version (my request) of The Gavel and loved it. Service was perfect, drinks and food spectacular.

This is walking distance (like 4 blocks) from Harrah&#39;s, so park there and walk. This is worth your time. Go to Tin Roof."

July comes around and I&#39;m registered for the Sundowner 5K. I pull up the Yelp app on my phone and see that it&#39;s only 4 miles away from the finish line. I message Tin Roof via Yelp to ask if I&#39;m going to be a total asshole if I show up in sweaty workout gear. Owner Brian F replies within 24 hours and assures me that people of all walks of life come in and out and I won&#39;t be the odd one out. Still, I opt to at least present the appearance of a productive member of society and bring along a change of clothes. I&#39;m glad I did, because this restaurant is a little nicer.

I&#39;d been waiting so long to come here that I looked my husband in the eye and said, &#34;I&#39;m ordering everything and you&#39;re sharing it with me.&#34; We didn&#39;t really order everything, but we may as well have. We got 4 cocktails, 2 appetizers and 3 entrees. I&#39;d have ordered a dessert too, but I&#39;m trying to watch my weight...

I&#39;ll start off with what was my least favorite about the meal so I can wrap this up with some positivity:

- We didn&#39;t like the Mai Tai (off menu item). Something was off about it and I can&#39;t tell if that&#39;s how it&#39;s normally served or if it was an off night. The ingredients seemed to be good, but the proportions were wrong or something. It was very bitter. I&#39;d have brought this to the attention of the bartender, but they were pretty busy and our server would disappear for a good amount of time. I drank it and moved on with my life. I wouldn&#39;t get this again.

- Deep Fried Bacon. I don&#39;t get it. I want to love it. It&#39;s deep fried, and it&#39;s bacon! I just don&#39;t think it works well. The batter masks the bacon. You gotta let the bacon speak for itself! But I will say they aren&#39;t the only place to do it and I have yet to find it done really well.

Here&#39;s what we thought was done really well:

- Charcuterie platter is large and delicious. It&#39;s well worth the price.
- Mahi Tacos, though a little dry, were well balanced.
- Surf &amp; Turf burger was tender. It had great flavor! God, those shrimp!
   *The chorizo overpowers the seafood. I&#39;d like to get shrimp tacos next time.
- Build Your Own Mac n&#39; Cheese is cheesy and creamy. I added bacon and prosciutto.
- Hurricanes are done very well, as are the Melon Ball (if you like anise) and Azteca D√≠a.

I was told by our waitress that they will be changing up the menu soon. I forget what they said they are taking off, but a few of the items she told us about that are being added sounded like they will more than make up for it."

My wife and I went to this place on 5/5/16, with the intentions of having a nice meal before attending a concert at the Rialto.  We had 6pm reservations, and we were stuck in traffic, so we called and told them we would be arriving 10 minutes late.  After more traffic headaches, we attempted to call to inform them we would now be 20 minutes late, however, we could not get through, because as it turns out, they took the phone off the hook!!  We arrived and were seated at 6:25- a server came and took our drink orders- 2 waters and a Cosmo for my wife.  TWENTY FIVE MINUTES later, no water(had to flag down the server to get that)AFTER 40 MINUTES, STILL NO COSMO- I headed to the bar area and found the manager, who apologized and blamed the long delay on a car accident that held up a bartender in traffic- he had a bartender prepare the Cosmo which, as my wife describes it, tasted like watered down fruit punch.  She said &#34;Since when is a Cosmo orange??&#34;  We returned it to the bar, the bartender stuck a straw in it and tasted it and said &#34;oh I forgot triple sec.&#34;  My wife settled for a vodka and tonic.  The manager assured me the kitchen was fully staffed and the car accident won&#39;t affect the food.  Wishful thinking!! We ordered an appetizer of the pizza- it came out cold.  I ordered the blackened chicken for the entree, my wife ordered the burger, and when asked by the server, decided to have steak fries with it.  Food came- mine, cold. The wife&#39;s plate consisted of her burger and ONE STEAK FRY(this is not a joke or an exaggeration)- ONE FLIPPING STEAK FRY!!  After pointing this out, the server brought a small plate of steak fries.  After discussing our evening with the manager, he decided the best way to handle this disaster was to tell us not to leave a tip for our server- not adjust the bill, but stiff the server!!  He would take care of her he assured us- right!!
It&#39;s a shame that this place is allowed to keep their doors open.  On a night when they could shine, fully knowing they would be crowded due to the show, they failed miserably-I WILL NEVER RETURN, AND WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE.  As we left, the manager said to us they were so busy he had to turn away at least 10 people wanting to eat there- if we could have only been one of those lucky ones!!"

I hope this place could be the thing that turns around downtown Joliet. The food here if pretty good, the drinks are the true star. We had the flat bread as an appetizer and it was good but the crust was very doughy, I was expecting that cracker thin style.

Inventive cocktail menu and unique beer list. Wine selections are limited. 

We started with the Mango Shrimp. Grilled shrimp on top of a fresh tasting mango salsa. Excellent and the highlight of our meal. We followed with the house salad. The Blackberry vinaigrette made the salad special. Entree was the Santa Monica Steak Tacos. The spiciness of the cabbage in the tacos overpowered the flavors. I like &#34;hot&#34;, but this was way too much. I would have preferred the Mango Salsa instead of the cabbage. 

Service was spotty. It seemed they were not prepared for the Rialto crowd which is odd since the restaurant is a block away. Our entrees showed up 25 minutes before showtime. 30 minutes after our salads. Most of the restaurant had cleared by the time we started eating. Our waitress was very nice and apologized for the delay. 

I can easily see rating Tin Roof higher should I visit again as we were enjoying ourselves for most of the evening. Just a few changes needed."

Once we were greeted with menus decoupaged to the back of classic vinyl albums, I realized not only was this place unique, but someone is playing on Pinterest! The collection of dishes not only contain local ingredients, but the combinations stray out of the lines from regular chains.

Based off Yelp reviews, we started with the charcuterie. GREAT choice (see picture) with a variety of cheeses and meats, all of which were drizzled with honey. My entire family found a component they liked and the bamboo serving board was empty by the time our entrees arrived.

We ordered a host of dishes, but the most memorable were the tacos and my steak. Previous reviews have suggested that the Santa Monica Street Tacos were plenty hot (and they were by my wife&#39;s standards), but I didn&#39;t notice much of a burn when I sampled them. My steak (special; porter reduction + ribeye) was not only well cooked, but had a TON of flavor!

The sides were tame and forgettable, but even my kids found a tasty dish they would enjoy during our visit. We also found if you check in via social media (pretty open ended) you get the choice of A) deep fried Twinkie or B) bacon cheesecake. We went with the deep fried Twinkie and it was gone in seconds!

I will gladly frequent Tin Roof not only for its proximity (across from my favorite, unhealthy Chick-n-spice), but more for it&#39;s tasty and unique presence in downtown Joliet. Cheers!"

We were greeted almost immediately, which was very promising. The server was warm and friendly and knowledgeable..., more good signs. But then it went south. I ordered the grown up grilled cheese, which was supposed to have gruy√®re, and cream of chicken with rice soup. I got a grilled cheese sandwich with three slices of bread and no gruy√®re. It was very bland and tasteless, albeit thick. The soup was some type of beef soup and not cream of chicken with rice. My wife ordered a blt sandwich, but requested it without cucumber (she has a sensitivity), and french fries. The sandwich arrived with cucumbers. So we brought it to the server attention and asked for another sandwich, but we got the original sandwich back, minus the cucumbers. The sandwich still tasted of cucumbers. So my wife couldn&#39;t eat and enjoy a $9.00 blt. In addition, the french fries were soft and soggy and greasy. As if the oil was not to temp when they were cooked. 

So, we won&#39;t be going back, even though we like to patronize local businesses."

I avoided the lunch rush this time and decided to take wife and kid for a late dinner on Friday.  We arrived at eight o&#39;clock and we waited about 10 minutes for a table.  I indulged in one of their really well mad old fashioned, phenomenal.

We sat and were greeted quickly, the waitress was very pleasant.  We ordered the deep fried bacon (B+) that came with ranch as a dipping sauce.   We ordered our food around 8:30 and sat and sipped on our drinks.  As time went by we watched the restaurant empty to about 50% capacity as you would expect at 9:00 on a Friday.  The waitress apologized for the wait numerous times, it was just weird.

We finally got our food.   I ordered the goat cheese and spinach stuffed pork chop (B).  The chop was luke warm..... which told me that my food was done 20 earlier and sat there.  It tasted ok, but it was a little dried out from it&#39;s wait time.  My wife ordered a build your own burger that she wasn&#39;t happy with because she felt that the meat was spiced weird.... Not tin Roof&#39;s problem.

My son at the basil pesto pizza (B).  It also had the look of sitting around for awhile.  

I can only assume that my wife&#39;s burger had to be re-done for some reason and that is why we waited so long and our entrees suffered as a result. 

Still love the concept and I still hold out hope that the kitchen and staff will get organized and service will improve.  I will definitely give Tin Roof one more shot before moving on."

I love(d) the Tin Roof and their attention to detail, creative cocktails, and their out of the ordinary menu selections but we went back tonight for the umpteenth time and had the most unpleasant experience, sitting next to a man who appeared (and was later confirmed) to be the owner. This was a Friday night the place was moderately crowded bar seats were hard to come by and he was sitting smack dab in the middle of he bar with his laptop sprawled out and a grimace on his face. He repeatedly badgered the busy employees as they were trying to serve customers with scheduling questions and purchasing questions, shouting out demands and negative comments well within earshot of our party and other customers. To say it was uncomfortable is an understatement. Everyone in my party felt the same. We intended to dine there but because of his bad attitude and negative energy we dined down the block. I feel bad for the employees they are truly talented and creative everyone always had a smile on their face and was ready to serve and tonight you could just feel all of the positive energy being sucked out of the room by this guy. The best thing he can do for his business is to stay away."

We&#39;ve lived in the area for over a year and had not yet eaten anywhere in Joliet because, well, of its terrible reputation for being a barren post-apocalyptic wasteland. But this place was was absolutely fantastic!

We got deep-fried bacon to start. If that sounds a little overly healthy for you, don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s served with a side of buttermilk ranch. It is way more delicious than it has any right to be. 

We also got carnitas tacos which were quite good, pumpkin sage ravioli which my wife loved, and mac n cheese which was among my favorite incarnations I&#39;ve ever had.

They had a few beers on tap, and some good ones in bottles too. Good cocktail list as well. Really everything I like in a place, this place did well. The service was a bit slow and disorganized, but very friendly. The atmosphere is cool but not pretentious. The section of downtown where it&#39;s located seemed nice enough to me. And there&#39;s a good looking cheesecake place right around the corner.

This place came up so we went based on reviews. The place was absolutely empty because we came at an off time, around 4pm, so we sat at the bar.

My rating is based on one star for the deep fried bacon (though they did not drain the grease, but it was tasty), and one star for the bartender and his drinks. He was nice and we had good conversation with him.

Food was disappointing. We ordered the deep fried bacon, flamed grilled chicken and west side steak wrap.

Flamed grilled chicken-potatoes and veggies were fine. Chicken was dry, but the flavor was good. They used a good marinade for it. They just need to figure out how to make it moist.

West side steak wrap-there was gristle and I asked for medium rare and it was well done. 2 pretty major fails. The potatoes were soggy and soaked in oil. The oil temperature must&#39;ve been too low. I did tell the bartender to tell the cook, and he also observed that the fries were soggy and oil-soaked,  so he said he&#39;d get me new fries. Alas, it took so long that we paid the bill and it still hadn&#39;t come so we just left. Granted we were in a bit of a hurry, but it was still slow. 

Deep fried bacon was really good. One bad flaw was that it felt like they went straight from the fryer basket to the plate without any rest for draining. I was able to squeeze oil out of it that it dripped over my fingers. I used napkins after that and soaked several bar napkins.

It seems like they&#39;re still working things out here, and it&#39;s a good concept so I hope they work out the kinks and succeed."

Even though they couldn&#39;t make it, we decided to go there anyway. I&#39;m glad we did. He was right.
This exactly the  kind of place I love. The d√©cor and atmosphere was great. It had a mellow but upbeat vibe. Kind of like an urban hole in the wall restaurant/lounge.
They don&#39;t take reservations, so it was a  crap shoot when we walked in at 7:45 on a Saturday night. (Although we have no problem having a drink and waiting for a table.)

We were greeted by the host (owner?) who was very friendly and laid back. He told us to sit anywhere we liked. Anywhere we liked, was the last available table towards the back. It was a 4 top, so we had some room. One side had the cushioned bench, which I also love.
Our server seemed like a genuinely friendly and nice guy. He was attentive to us the entire time we were there. (I can&#39;t think of his name for the life of me.)
The wife and I enjoy various charcuterie boards when we go out, so we got that and a couple of cocktails. (Moscow Mule for her and a Manhattan for me.) The cocktails were great. They seem to put care into making them. I appreciate that. 
When the charcuterie, we loved it. A large board with salami, prosciutto, 3 kinds of cheese, 3 kinds of fruit, and some toast points. They drizzled some honey on it as well. Wow. The entire thing was delicious. We chatted, ate and ordered more cocktails. By the time we were done, we did not have room for dinner or dessert.  I was watching other plates come out of the kitchen and it all looked great. 

They had live music from 8:00-10:00, which I also love. Mellow background music. Acoustic guitar and some light percussion. (I&#39;m Italian, so I talk loud as it is, so I hate having to talk louder over music.)

We stayed till about 10:15 -10:30 and had a great time. Next time we&#39;ll come back for dinner. 

My ONLY complaint is that they didn&#39;t open closer to my house. I would be a regular."

I have utilized a Groupon on a few visits and there were no issues. I consider this restaurant a small gem in downtown Joliet. The bartender changes specialty drinks every month, or few weeks, and I am impressed with the variety.  

The food as promised in the menu is freshly made to order, so be patient. The wait is worth the reward. It is hard to recommend any one menu item as I have not eaten anything bad. 

Downfalls - spacing. It is a restaurant where you may be sitting very close to people you don&#39;t know with a half bench half table seating arrangement. 

It does crowd up quickly on nights the Rialto holds a show. I would suggest you get there at least 2 hours before a show if you want dinner.

It is extremely dark, the servers have been slow in refilling drinks, even wine and beer, and there is only one bathroom each upstairs. Last time in a server advised a few of us standing around that there was a bathroom downstairs, but going down there was never presented as an option by any hostess, waiter/ress.

It was a Wednesday night and I think there were 3 table taken in the restaurant but I am sure it&#39;s busier on the weekends. 

Our server (AJ I think), came by and took our drink order. I also started with the asparagus soup which was AMAZING. The drinks from the bar took a little longer than the water and soda but no big deal. I got the pesto pasta, no tomatoes. It was good, but I felt like it lacked a little flavoring. The meals don&#39;t come with a salad, bread, etc so keep that in mind. I felt like it was a good portion for $12, though. My mom had the mahi tacos, they looked kind of blah but she enjoyed them. Both our friends got the Date Night Salad..it was mentioned there wasn&#39;t enough feta on the salad but they liked it.

We were not offered coffee or dessert at the end and it took QUITE some time for our server to return with the bill. He did separate the checks, which was nice. Overall I felt for how empty it was, the service was way too slow.

We figure out what took forever. The very nice gas grill was outside. Everyone came in and ordered at the same time. Anything grilled came to the table at room temperature. 

I ordered the Chaucetrie plate. It was very good. Nice lean

Really good but small amount of blackberries, raspberries and grapes all w a drizzle of honey easily dinner for one and maybe two. I shared with a few people.

The cocktail list had some ingredients we had never heard of, but our server was extremely knowledgeable. I&#39;m not a bourbon girl, but he had such good things to say about the Breakfast of Champions cocktail that I took a chance. It was delicious!

We had the deep fried bacon as a starter. Now, I never want bacon any other way. It&#39;s a must try!

As the main meal, my boyfriend had a wrap (West Side Wrap) with steak, cream cheese, and a Thai sauce. He enjoyed the flavor combination, and the steak was perfectly cooked. His meal was great, but mine was outstanding! I had the pork chops. They were Cajun seasoned and topped with caramelized apples and goat cheese. They were to. die. for. They were sweet, yet savory, and melted in my mouth. They were served with rice and veggies. My boyfriend and I both took half our meals home, so the portions were generous.

I had a crappy day. I came here - my day is better; that simple. 
GREAT FOOD and even GREATER DRINKS (see photo of drink menu). Look, the music is excellent, the staff are friendly, and the ambiance is dimly-lit-lean-closer-intimate-fun. (Ironic that I&#39;m dining alone tonight- but I imagine Barbara here with me).

The starters were excellent. My nephew had the deep fried bacon. Which he loved. We also ordered Mango Grilled Shrimp and Basil Pesto Pizza.  All I&#39;m thinking these appetizers are so good. Please don&#39;t let the food be disappointing. Thank You Jesus the food was on point. I had the farmers pasta with shrimp. I also tried everyone else&#39;s food. I sampled the quad chicken and surf and turf burger. All I can say is I wanna go back like today. 
Everything was so fresh. Chicken Breast was moist. The hamburger though wow !

My husband and I have frequented this location over 17 years (engagement here,Christening party for our first born here) and have supported the multiple establishments at this location and Chris reinforced to us today why we keep coming back.  There have been highs and lows to this location and experience, and particularly today, with all the construction outside of the restaurant, I am certain many people are driven away.  That is their loss.  The food is top-notch (we love the Mahi tacos), the drinks are like none other in Joliet and whether it is Chris or Danny or any other tending bar, you are made to feel welcome.

The owner was extremely friendly and sat down to talk to us and the music they host is always very festive. There was appetizers set out for the party and one of them was deep fried bacon and as grotesque as that sounds on the arteries it may have been my favorite thing I have eaten all year; absolutely delicious! 

They are also beginning trivia on Tuesday nights I believe so that will be a fun thing to keep on the radar.

I thought the waitress was very sweet and she was extremely attentive while we were there even with how busy the place was. We will definitely be back to have dinner one night!"

The seating arrangement is very tight which I did not enjoy. The service is SLOW....When we were seated, it took about 15 minutes for our waiter to ask us what we wanted to drink. Then, when we ordered our drinks it took another 20 minutes to get them. We wanted to order our food right away because we didn&#39;t know how long it would take for our waiter to return after bringing us our drinks. The food took awhile to make, but it does warn on the menu that everything is hand crafted so it does take a little longer (understandable). Also, we were served warm water without ice-yuck. 
I liked the restaurant decor and mood. It&#39;s a decent restaurant if you enjoy eating with a family of 4 sitting shoulder to shoulder with you....I would suggest going during off times so you can fully enjoy your experience without feeling crowded."

Not an ideal location for the style they were going for, but would be more reasonable if there were more businesses in the downtown Joliet area. 
Prices are slightly high for Joliet restaurant located in downtown Joliet, but I think the food and environment is worth the price. It&#39;s comparable to a restaurant in any big city; different. And the menu is different from what you&#39;d find in a Joliet eatery. 
Although I enjoyed my meal (grilled Mahi Mahi), my date sent his back (farmers pasta). One of the owners came over to personally apologize and ask if he would like something else, free of charge. Even though he declined, they comped our ENTIRE order. And gave us an appetizer on the house, even though we did not order one. 
Overall, I&#39;d recommend this establishment and go back."

Well I&#39;m happy report that these negative reviews were unfounded, at least in our case. Our server was AJ, we had him before and as last time it was nothing but a pleasure. There were 3 of us dining, we had the El Diablo Pasta, Bacon Cheddar Burger &amp; a Carolina Chicken Sandwich. We&#39;ve had the El Diablo Pasta before and it was just as delicious as the first time we had it. With the Burger and Chicken Sandwich we had fries and like a lot of reviews, the fries were soggy and greasy. I did mention this to AJ, and he said they are looking into improving their fries. I hope so, because had the fries been on par, Tin Roof would have received 5 stars instead of 4.

Looking forward to our next visit."

To begin I was quite disappointed with the food quality. It promotes farm to table but I don&#39;t think that is true. The quality of the food did not look or taste fresh. With the amount of wait for you to get your meal I would think they would have enough time to go kill the cow and serve fresh meat. The drink were also mediocre not something to rave about at all, I am sure I can make a better cocktail at home.  I am not really sure why this place has four stars. Looks like maybe a bunch of fake reviews from friends. At the best I will maybe give it two stars and that would be if the food was free. Save your time and money."

Waitress was very friendly. The negatives: the food was overly seasoned and spiced. Expect food to have a spicier bent. Now we like spicy food but there was so much spice that you could not taste the actual food itself. The ceviche had a heavy chipotle flavor and you could not taste the shrimp. The chips were good. We ordered steaks and they were fatty. I did appreciate the mixed vegetables. The short of it: pop in for a drink or get more traditional bar food."

Thanks to yelp, I found this place. Got to love the local restaurants. Nice to take a break from chain restaurants that my coworker was taking me, bleh. Has exactly what I needed, nice decor, great waiters, local grown food, and a decent beer selection:

They have a parking lot which was great. Immediately greeted. It was dead when we came, it was around 6 on a Tuesday, but more people came afterwards. It was interesting to have record albums as a backboard to the menus. I ordered an imperial stout on tap which was good. I saw the deep fried bacon on the menu and of course I got to have it. Last time I had this was in Omaha. I&#39;ll give a &#39;BANGIN&#39; on the bacon! Then I had the strip steak. I ordered medium, but it turned out more on the well side. Wish it was cooked right, but I&#39;ll give an OK. I was worried about my coworker not like this place, but he did say that he really like his food. He had a salad and the chicken.

She came back nervous and couldn&#39;t exactly tell me why on &#34; today&#34; they could not deliver.. I thought it was strange since they are known to deliver and it shows that they deliver in Yelp.. She was stuttering which made it sound like she was lying... I travel globally , a lot and when a restaurant says they don&#39;t deliver, there is no stuttering, they just say &#34;we don&#39;t deliver&#34;..  I don&#39;t feel anything , I say Thank you and find another one who delivers.. No biggie..

I expect a lot out of establishments that I visit and choose to spend my money at. That being said, Tin Roof exceeded my expectations!!! 
I visited this expertly decorated establishment on Valentine&#39;s Day with my husband, brother and sister. I am not much for Valentine&#39;s Day, we were just looking for good food and a good time. 
Knowing that it is Valentine&#39;s Day, I attempted to make a reservation (left a voicemail as they do not open until 5 pm), I was very pleased to get a return call at about 5 pm! They do not take reservations for parties under 6 people, but that did not deter us!
We arrived at about 6:45 pm, the dining room was full but we secured some seats at the bar to have a few drinks to kill the 30 min wait (not bad at all for a holiday). 
Brian who was our bartender (and also apparently the owner/ manager upon further investigation) was awesome!!! He is truly a master at his craft! My brother had the &#34;breakfast of champions&#34;, my sister had the &#34;vodka #2&#34;, my husband had the old fashioned and I had the &#34;Cuban winters&#34; which is mojito. They all pleased their respective drinkers. My brother and husband are quite the whiskey/ bourbon drinkers and were very impressed and pleased with their drinks. I enjoyed the mojito throughly, not too sweet and just the right amount of mint (pictured below)! 
Our table was ready after a bit (probably right around 30 mins, we were having a great time chatting and watching Brian set drinks afire, so we were not too concerned about the wait) and we were sat in the cozy dining room. Our server was John, he was funny and sarcastic, just the way I like them! He was great, attentive and friendly. 
We ordered another round of drinks and some appetizers: fried bacon (how could you not!) and the Mac and cheese that another yelper had described as &#34;mouthgasmic&#34;. 
The fried bacon was good, I am not much for a lot of batter on my fired food, but I can&#39;t fault them for my personal preference, overall B+! My siblings were IN LOVE with the home made ranch dressing!
The Mac and cheese (A) was indeed mouthgasmic. Slightly crispy on top, VERY ooey-gooey and hearty (perfect to share for 4 people, very large portion, would also work for a meal!) 
I shared the cream of asparagus soup (A+) with my hubby which was honestly one of the best soups I have ever had, it was perfectly seasoned, not too salty (which I find to be the downfall of most soup)!
Side note: there was live music which was nice and they gave all of the ladies in the restaurant a rose for the occasion! I though that was a very nice touch! 
Now onto dinner, my husband had the El Diablo shrimp pasta (A) he loved it! The waiter had warned him that there was a ghost pepper (one of the worlds hottest peppers) used in the dish, it didn&#39;t scare him off (but it was nice to warn him of that)! He said he would order it again any time!
I had The Gavel (A+) which was a blackened chicken sandwich with jack cheese, peppers, onions and tomatoes. To my delight it was served in a pretzel bun ( yummmm!) The chicken was very moist and perfectly seasoned, not too spicy! I had the French fries (C) which were OK, they were a little greasy, I will try them again though, maybe it was just a bad batch. 
My sister had the grown up grilled cheese (A), she is VERY PICKY but loved it and finished it! She had the rice as a side which I tasted and was also very good!
My brother had the farmers pasta with chicken (A) which was LOADED with veggies! I had a bite and I think that will be my next order! Very light sauce with big flavors!
We were too stuffed to order dessert but their selections of a deep fried Twinkie, deep fried cream puffs or bacon topped cheese cake sounded heart-stoppingly (and heart clogging!) delicious! 
We are so excited that there is a new choice for dining in downtown Joliet and we will DEFINITELY be back for more!"

The waitress, Lauren, was very friendly and attentive, as well as the bartender that welcomed us when we walked in.  The atmosphere is very welcoming with some decor and light fixtures from old churches.  We delightfully discovered that the menus are glued to the backs of old record albums covers, very cool idea.  We had the farmhouse pasta and BYOB Build Your Own Burger with bacon, pineapple and provolone added with Laurens suggestion. The steak fries that came with the burger were very tasty but slightly under cooked for my liking.  There was a drunk and disorderly customer that was handled with tact, respect then gracefully escorted out of the building, nice job guys.  If we are in the area again we will stop.

I had the not till November cocktail tasted like sweet potato pie garnished with a toasted marshmallow. Yum! The fiance and i started with deep fried bacon and assuming it was homemade ranch for dipping. It was very tasty. I had the stockyard steak for my entree with fresh roasted veggies which perfect. The chiptole chutney that came with the steak was spicy but good. The fiance had the chipotle bacon burger which was juicy and the pretzel bun was very fresh.

No tomato juice, couldn&#39;t order 3 or 4 other things on the menu. The garden salad was a small bowl of lettuce and one cherry tomato. Music was some kind of heavy, hard rock (loud) and service was slow (we were one of several tables to have to seek out our server). I work nearby and wanted this to be good..bummed."

We decided to try it out and we were not disappointed. The place is clean, nice and well-lit. We were greeted by a big hello by the entire crew in the kitchen. The wall was decorated by pictures of i guess all the guest that came in the restaurant. 

Its like the &#34;subway&#34; version of pizza!

You choose the size of the pizza and the toppings you want to go with it. If you are overwhelmed with the choices, they have a classic that is listed in their wall and they will make it for you. 

It is not expensive too! At $7 you have a dinner. Plus they serve alcohol too. Now the best thing about their pizza? My 3 year old picky eater loved it!!! We got a 2nd pizza just for her!"

They don&#39;t drown it in tomato sauce like that deep dish people try to pass for pizza, and then they select the toppings to your preference, with lots of options. And a personal 11 inch pie is about $8 (with however many toppings you want).

I was pleased they had fresh spinach, artichoke hearts, fresh garlic cloves, and roasted red peppers. Disappointed the mushrooms are not saut√©ed and no eggplant on the menu. (Jalape√±os, feta cheese and calamata olives, but no eggplant shows it&#39;s not real Italian.)

It&#39;s not the best pizza in town, because it&#39;s not old school NY pie, but if you are downtown, looking for something fast, this is pretty darned good!"

Basically the same concept, order your pizza or salad size, add your toppings, pay, wait a few minutes for your pizza to bake, enjoy. Easy peasy.

I love this easy, customizable, and quick concept. The pizza was delicious and was exactly what I wanted since I was able to choose my toppings. They also have a menu board of pizza toppings they suggest. The crust is neopolitan style and seriously delicious. 

Service was great. All the employees were right on top of their duties and the restaurant seemed to run like a well oiled machine.

I got a mini pizza with alfredo sauce, garlic rub (yum!), Pepperoni, mushrooms, red onion, and fresh rosemary (nice touch). I felt like the crust is a little too thin; you can get double crust but from the way it was described by the staff member it turned it into a stuffed pizza, which I wouldn&#39;t want, just a thicker crust in general. 

On Friday night the place was VERY loud with screaming kids, most tables full (it isn&#39;t very big). Definitely not a place or day for a peaceful meal....

Overall, my fave for this kind of pizza is probably still Bricks in Wheaton, but Mod was a modest success, and I&#39;m sure we will be back, out of convenience if nothing else."

Feels like the subway of pizza. You pick your pizza size, dough, toppings and in about 10 minutes or less your pizza comes out hot and fresh. I will say that the sausage I had was a little too salty, but it is what it is. 

Lagunitas IPA and other beer and wine on tap.

The pizza is grilled on a brick oven which gives it a nice crisp finish. For those of you who don&#39;t drink pop, they have fresh tea and lemonade.

I&#39;d never been here before but heard it described as &#34;chipotle, but for pizza&#34;. Pretty spot-on. It&#39;s a place where you make your own pizza, however you like it, with whatever toppings. Same price. 

The decor and vibe are very modern-casual, lots of wood and brushed metal, which is super cool IMO. The most popular places on the west coast have this sort of design and I can see this easily becoming a hotspot for local students. 

The wait is pretty long. It wasn&#39;t particularly crowded, but in general there aren&#39;t too many employees (what do i call them? pizza assemblers? Ive decided they are called pizzarinos) and there are probably about 70 toppings to choose from, so each order takes quite some time. The Pizzarinos are really friendly and decent conversationalists, though, so it&#39;s not bad, provided you&#39;re not in too much of a hurry. I feel like fast casual pizza is pretty tough to nail simply because of the time aspect.  

The baking time is like five minutes for the pizza. I enjoyed it, but my mother found that it was too doughy and not done enough. There&#39;s a wide array of toppings and the Pizzarinos help you choose ingredients that will make a coherent flavor profile, which is always helpful. 

Recommendations:
- whatever is on your pizza, pesto would probably improve it.
- there&#39;s not a lot of spicy stuff here, so be sure to ask for some &#34;Srirancha&#34; sauce for that little extra kick you know you crave"

It was our first time here, since it is relatively new.  They have three sizes of pizza: mini, mod, and mega.  We each got the mod pizza.  I got the jasper pizza and added pineapples to the pizza.  With the added pineapples, it was a good blend of spicy and sweet.  I like how you can add as much ingredients as you want, and they don&#39;t charge you extra.  We each also got a bottle of beer.  The beer was reasonably priced.  The employees at Mod pizza were really nice and friendly.  One of the employees asked if we needed anything else.  Also, she said that she can give us a milkshake (any flavor), and it was on them.  I decided to try the chocolate milkshake with toffee topping.  It was really good and thick.

I ordered a mini pizza off the menu board. It was a quick process -they make it right in front of you so you can ask for additional toppings. It goes into the oven and comes out a couple minutes later.

I devoured mine and went back for another mini. This time I went all out with the toppings. It was delicious.

It&#39;s a great value for the price. They have a range of toppings - gorgonzola cheese, artichoke hearts, roasted garlic, kalamata olives.

I didn&#39;t see any spinach though. That would be nice. A spinach and feta pesto pizza. 

You can also do halfsies - two set of toppings on each half of the crust. But I didn&#39;t know this till later when i saw someone do it. I&#39;ll try that next time!

The staff here was phenomenal. As I age and approach my 30s, I&#39;m fearful of teenagers (what is a TURNT????) but all the kids working at MOD were super nice, energetic and professional. I was actually pretty impressed by how upbeat everyone was. Maybe it&#39;s because they don&#39;t realize the impending student loans and mortgage payments that await them muhahaha.

I was there on Friday, 5/20 around 4-5pm? I wanted to talk to a manager just to compliment the staff, food and experience. But I had garlic breath by then so figured it&#39;d be better posted here :)

I think the manager with the glasses needs to be reminded that without customers, he would not have a job. He was rude and unwilling to honor a simple request to put the Cubs game on a certain tv during the World Series. He apparently is not smart enough, or observant enough, to realize that 99% of the customers in the bar were wearing Cubs gear and that was the primary reason anyone was there. It&#39;s the World Series buddy, get real. 

He said No when asked to change the tv closest to us to the Cubs and when we asked &#34;really?&#34; he sarcastically replied &#34;really&#34; and walked away. After telling the bar tender we will close out and we&#39;re leaving to go somewhere else, the tv magically got changed to the Cubs game.

Go there if (1) you want to watch the game, drink and nibble on some bar food, or (2) want a quick bite for lunch. Do not go there if you want a sit-down casual dinner. All the tables are bar-height / counter-height (not dining table height). Lots and lots of TVs to watch all the games. Leave the kids at home (see &#34;Ambiance&#34; below).

Food is average. I ordered the BBQ Brisket Sandwich. BBQ sauce is good, but they hardly put any on the sandwich, so the sandwich was dry and bland. My husband order the Half-Slab of Ribs. He enjoyed them and said they tasted very fresh. Both meals came with coleslaw and fries. The coleslaw had an off-taste, very bland. I think they put a bit of mayo on it and forgot the salt, sugar, and vinegar. Fries were cooked thoroughly and crispy. His meal came with a cornbread muffin--standard box mix, very dry.

Waitress and service was fine and timely.

Ambiance: Noise level was fine. But we had the misfortune of sitting next to a table of 4 men, 2 of which had the nastiest, most foul language. Each sentence out of their mouths contained at least three words of profanity. So this is NOT a family-friendly environment. In 45 minutes time, we heard about 100 curse-words.  

Food was okay, but I would not go back there solely because I do not enjoy being surrounded by ignorant, immature, angry, 40-something-year-old men constantly spewing curse words because they hate their jobs, hate their lives, can&#39;t get a date, blah, blah, blah."

For a bar attached to an OTB and golfing dome, I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect food-wise. I think my mind was thinking back to the batting cages I used to go to where the food was at about carnival status (chips and nacho cheese, etc), but this food was really good!

This would be a great place to catch a game- tons of tvs and good drink specials. Service was super friendly. They have a lot of nice people there who seem to enjoy their job.

I ended up ordering their Tipsy Stout burger- a stout-glazed (I think?) beef patty with brown sugar bacon, crispy onions, merkts cheese and on a pretzel bun. This was a perfect combination! I hadn&#39;t had a burger in a while and this one was worth the splurge! The flavors of salty and sweet meshed so well. That was one for the books! The fries that came with it were also good, and there is the option to upgrade to tots for 50 cents more or sweet potato fries for $1 more. Everyone else enjoyed their food too. One thing I noticed in particular was my friend&#39;s buffalo chicken wrap. Not only was it loaded with chicken, the lettuce in it looked dark and healthy! I&#39;m a lettuce elitist and the less ice berg I see, the better!

I am new to town and looking for a home town bar. Stop In here a few times and I can not say that I&#39;m really impressed. Bartenders  are friendly, but not very talkative to new people.  Only really came around to ask if I was ok. Tried to talk to them, but they were more interested in talking to the regulars.  I understand that I&#39;m an outsider, but they did not need to make me feel that way!!!

They could not make green beer on St. Patrick&#39;s Day!!! What, it was the major reason that I was out!!!  

Food is good!"

The service last night was poor.  The servers seemed really uninterested in our group of 12.  They&#39;d check in with our table once and awhile but leave before everyone could put in a drink order.

McQ&#39;s was formerly Ditka Dome (a dump) until the folks at Mistwood Golf in Romeoville bought it and completely transformed it.  It is 2-tiered and the the balls are fantastic, not scuffed up and old balls, but always like new and washed. The tees and mats are well-kept. There is a chipping green and 2 putting greens. 

If that wasn&#39;t enough, the sports bar (an official Blackhawks bar), has the best BBQ around. The chef at Mistwood oversees the food at the dome and the dry-rubbed chicken wings are the best. The BBQ sampler platter is an amazing deal: ribs, pulled pork, pulled chicked, 5 wings, Texas toast and fries. We go there just to eat, it&#39;s that good. Every single person I have taken there has said they are the best wings they have eaten. 

Buffalo Grove and White Pines are not even close. And please don&#39;t mention Top Golf. I was at the new one in Naperville and asked the golf staff why the tees are too low to hit a Driver. I was told they do not want you hitting it over the nets. Top Golf is too expensive for what you get. Not sure I understand why anyone would go there for food and beer since the food at McQ&#39;s is  far better anyway. And the golf pros at Mistwood occupy the first two stalls and have Trackman setup and ready to give you lessons. They are terrific teachers and work with all ages. They teach the kids of several high schools, including the two-time Illinois girls state amateur champ and are US Kids Certified golf instructors teaching kids as young as 6 or 7 who are just starting out. Can&#39;t say enough about what they have done for my 7 year old daughter&#39;s game.

I am so glad they bought the old Ditka Dump Dome and transformed it into the first-class place it is today as McQ&#39;s."

My server was sitting in the off track for 20 minutes. Never came back to see if we needed anything. The bar back needed to go to the off track to find a server to have the table behind us check out. I do find it odd the manager has been sitting in the off track betting horses instead of paying attention to his clients. It is unfortunate that the manager cares about customers less than he appears to care about betting horses.  After we voiced our disappointment with service, the manager went back to the off track to check his tickets. Too bad seeing this place slide as much as it has."

The wife and I saw the ad in our weekly clipper and were excited to try the &#34;best bbq in town.&#34; We met some friends there last Friday night around 7. First off, the place is very tiny and the tables are all crowded together with barely any elbow room. There&#39;s nothing to absorb the sound either so the atmosphere is very loud, especially later when the band crammed in the corner started to play.

There was no hostess so we seated ourselves.... 20 mins later we finally were asked about drinks. They have decent specials and good beer on tap. That&#39;s one star for me. So we finally got menus to order from and I ordered the brisket sandwich and the wife ordered the pulled pork. Now when the food came out the my heart sank... The portions were very small... The brisket was supposed to be on Texas toast but was on regular dry white thin toast. The slices of brisket were too thick, tough, and mostly fat. Plus there were only 3 little slices. The wife&#39;s pulled pork was so dry and burnt that she took one bite and that was it. The fries were decent, but not fresh cut like stated on the menu. Items are fairly priced, but ya don&#39;t get what you pay for. The other star I&#39;m giving is for their bbq sauces. They have 3 to choose from, spicy, sweet, and traditional vinegar based. Those were pretty good. My friends ordered the sampler, which had one rib, 3 wings, a little pulled pork and 2 slices of brisket... For almost 20 bucks. They were equally disappointed over all. When you order bbq you expect a big amount of savory, delicious food... This was far from that.

Over all this is NOT the place for bbq but is a decent place for happy hour drinks. Personally I&#39;ll never be back to eat."

I like that they give you 3 salsas in the beginning - mild, medium, and hot. They were good. A good addition to whatever dish you get, as well.

I ordered the carne asada taco, a chorizo taco, and side of Mexican rice. The tacos were okay. Mexican rice was alright. My boyfriend got a burrito. It was a huge portion, and it looked delicious.

The empanadas were probably my favorite dish. We got it as an appetizer. Oooh! Also the tres leches cake was AMAZING for dessert! So yummy.

Boyfriend said margarita was too sour.

The service was wonderful, though. Maybe I&#39;ll come back and give it another try someday. Just wasn&#39;t too impressed with the food.

The first time was two years ago and all I can remember was that I was not impressed. I decided since I could not remember why, that I would try it again. 

I like that they give you 3 salsas but even the mild salsa has quite a bit of a kick. I wish that there was a more mild option. 

I had a strawberry daiquiri which was very tasty and only $8. I liked that it tasted like a daiquiri I would get on a beach. It was not syrupy either. 

For my meal I had the Mago salad with chicken added. It was pretty good, but I&#39;m not dying to have it again either. I think the jicama in it is unnecessary and doesn&#39;t add to the texture or taste. The portion size was fantastic and the meat was pretty good. I wish they cut the chicken a little bit more because it is difficult to cut chicken on top of a salad. Why create extra work for me if you are cutting it already?

The chips and sauces they delivered were delicious. The chips were fresh out of the oven. Chips like these are often dangerous...they can easily fill you up before the main course! 

We decided on the Prie-Fix meal to alleviate any potential confusion with ordering (and paying). We began by ordering Empanadas and Tamales for appetizers, both of which were fresh and tasty and delivered in a timely manner. 

The main courses included Arroz Con Pollo (rice with Chicken), Enchiladas and Steak Fajitas. The Arroz Con Pollo was very similar to Chicken Pot Pie. Again, each dish was fresh, delicious and probably (definitely!) not good for the waistline. Oh well, this was a celebration - so it didn&#39;t count ;)

Just when we thought we couldn&#39;t eat another bite, dessert was served. The dessert was churros with chocolate dipping sauce. Oh man, we definitely found room for this dessert. 

Overall, this was an outstanding experience. I would recommend this restaurant to everyone and would certainly consider coming back in the future.

BIG SHOUT OUT to our waitress Judith. She was charismatic, friendly, charming, and a pleasure to talk with. She rolled with the punches... laughing and joking with the table. Honestly, having a waitress as awesome as Judith is a key reason I&#39;ll 5-star a restaurant. Her positive attitude and service made the experience thoroughly enjoyable!"

Upon entering this establishment, it is easy to notice the bright decor.  The restaurant definitely has a positive vibe to it, and I liked this aspect about it. 

Immediately after sitting down at the table, my eyes were drawn to the attractive cocktails on the cocktail menu, but ultimately since I had a long evening drive to Central Illinois ahead of me, I knew I needed caffeine. I asked the waitress if they sold coffee, and she told me that they had Mexican style coffee available. I opted for this slightly spicy coffee, and was  pleased. The coffee could have been a couple levels warmer, but I didn&#39;t expect much at 6pm on a Friday evening from a restaurant like this. 

I liked the complimentary trio of salsa and chips, but I believe that it would be a smart idea to have one mild salsa, instead of all of the salsas being varying levels of spicy. I like spicy foods a lot, and have a high tolerance, but the complimentary salsa choices aren&#39;t good for people with a lower spice tolerance. For my main dish, I had the salsa verde enchiladas and they were really good. These enchiladas were seasoned well, and the portion size was more than enough in relation to the cost of the meal. 

Our waitress during our visit was very nice and pleasant to be around. Overall, I think this place is a great option in the Bolingbrook area for a sit down Mexican restaurant."

Before our entrees there are chips with three kinds of salsa, which were all spicy but tasty.

I had the shrimp tacos which were 2 for $7.  They had a sweet and spicy peanut sauce and the tacos were filled with a great amount of shrimp.  The server was very friendly and made sure our table had plenty of water which was good since the food had a lot of heat. 

Overall a good experience!  Will need to try out more entrees and cocktails.  The table next to us had guacamole made tableside that looked delicious!"

All are very delicious, I had the Steak Tacos (carne asada) and there are a lot of steaks and very tasty. They have plenty of choices, although for most of it, I dont know or understand since I dont speak Spanish. But our server was very helpful &amp; polite with all our questions.

I think the only complaint that I will give is the place is very tight. From the main entrance, people are lined-up waiting and you really have to squeeze yourself to get out of the restaurant."

Just denied me and my family bringing in a stroller on an empty Saturday afternoon.

Completely rude, condescending and unfriendly.

They&#39;ve really done a great job with this area.  I don&#39;t get over here often, so I am not familiar with the stores or the layout.  On a sunny Saturday I decided to wander around and check the place out.   After a bit of shopping, I came upon Mago and decided to have lunch.

I sat at a table in the bar area.  Service was on-point.  Chips and 3 kinds of salsa were brought out.  I had a house margarita and that was very good. I had a chicken burrito, and it was huge, I ate 1/2.  The chicken was flavorful and not dry.  I was in and out in about 40 minutes.  

I&#39;d like to come back with a group and try some of the other menu items, especially the guac.  Just another reason to do more shopping!"

First, the atmosphere is astounding. Very vibrant but not over-powering. We came during the day, so it was not too quite nor too loud. I had no complaints about the atmosphere.

Next, the service was fantastic. My girlfriend has a dairy allergy, and this can sometimes be troublesome for her when eating out, but not here! The first thing our waitress asked was if we had any food allergies. She then clarified that the complementary salsas (more on that later) were all good for us to eat. She also verified that any food we ordered was safe for us to eat as well. She checked on us fairly often (but not too much to the point where it got annoying). Overall, perfect service. I couldn&#39;t ask for anything more!

Then, the drinks: pretty legit. They had a wide selection of drinks. I had a Tamarindo and my girlfriend had a frozen margarita. The margarita was little stronger than most places make, but the Tamarindo was spot on. Rarely do I find a place with Tamarinds, so this was a nice find. 

And then there&#39;s the food...wow! First, we were instantly greeted with chips and salsa. Mago boasts three different salsas, and they&#39;re all unique, yet tasty. They&#39;ll even bring more of your favorite salsas to top your meal with!  And the entrees were out of this world. I got the steak chilaquiles and my girlfriend got a steak California burrito. Both were super delicious, and we got a lot of food for the price. Very satisfied all-around. They also make table-side Guac in front of you for $10. We did not get this, but the table next to us did, and it looked amazing. 

Lastly, the bill: not too bad, especially for all you get! Drinks were about $9-$10 each and the entrees we got were $13-$14 each, which was about the average entree price on the menu. And service was so good that we had to leave a pretty generous tip. 

Overall, this is a great place and I highly recommend it to anyone! Great staff, food, atmosphere, and drinks. There&#39;s nothing to complain about here! An easy 5/5."

We thought it was going to be a good girls night out, we were wrong. First the hostess, didn&#39;t catch her name, she was the main one taking names and numbers, she was kind of rude and I really couldn&#39;t understand her. I told her my name for the wait list and she kept asking &#34;what?&#34; Like she couldn&#39;t hear. So we finally got on the wait list. 30 minutes later we were taken to our table by another rude host. He point to our table and just placed the menus down in the middle of the table and left. Our waitress, Nicole, was super friendly and amazing. She took out drink orders and came back quick. I was surprised because of how busy it was. We had some fresh guacamole made right near our table with was the best we have ever had. Nicole took our orders and we sat there and talked. Our food didn&#39;t take that long to come out. Still hot when we got which was great. My carne asada was just perfect. We were impressed with how great everything was until we were getting ready to pay. We asked Nicole for our check, she took way to long to bring it out. I put my credit card in the book and it took her about a good 20 minutes to come back for it. We were getting annoyed because we saw her a few times just walking around and we were going to be late to the movies. She finally came took it and brought it back with no pen. I had to get up and search for someone to give me a pen. The hostess with the long hair finally gave me one, I signed and we left. Next time we go maybe we&#39;ll go durning the week when it&#39;s not super busy. Or maybe they should have more people helping out."

I have eaten here twice and both times I was very happy with the uniqueness of the entrees and the flavors.   The table side guacamole station is a really nice touch, nothing like fresh guac!!

The mole portion of the menu is phenomenal.  But then again the whole menu is phenomenal.

Mojitos are spot on as well.  Just eat here and thank me later.   

Then only negative.... very small and very busy.  They will take your cell number and then you go shop and they will text you when your table is ready, so that makes the wait tolerable."

I frequent it often, as it is great for large groups as well as small get togethers. In the few years it has been open, I have definitely noticed some changes in the menu and the service, some good and some bad. 

I generally get the table-side guacamole to start. It is so delicious and fresh! Make sure to tip the lady who does it.

I usually get the tacos as my meal but I have tried the fajitas and the quesadilla and both were good. The tacos used to come 3 to an order but are now ordered individually. I always get the tinga and I&#39;ve tried the shrimp (good) and the veggie (not so good). I ask for the flour tortillas as well.

The salsa and chips they start you with are always amazing! The orange peanut salsa has definitely gotten hotter over time. If you prefer 1 type, ask for a bigger bowl of it and they&#39;ll bring that over. I love the green and the mild. 

They used to give you free soup before the meal and then they changed it to only if you asked for it and now they charge $4 for it. It isn&#39;t that great so just pass on it.

Service is hit or miss. Last time I went, our waitress was so sweet and kind. The time before that, our waiter spent most of his time chatting with his friend at the bar and I actually had to go over to get him.

Thursdays they have live marichi music (be warned-it&#39;s LOUD) and $6 sangria which is tasty! I like that they use OpenTable and they&#39;re generally pretty busy so try to make a reservation."

You can park in the lot near either of these two locations, and then you just need to walk into the mall a bit down the path between them and you will see it on your left. 

The restaurant itself has both indoor and (limited) outdoor seating and is rather tiny but full of life and energy! They have a huge menu of amazing Mexican dishes, along with a nice full bar of drinks to go along with. I recommend checking out their offerings online before you go, because it is SO hard to make a decision between all of these amazing dishes! 

One must-try is the guacamole - they will wheel up the cart and make it for you fresh right at your table (tips encouraged). I also had their sangria (strong!) and the 3 taco special. Everything that we ordered was tasty and fresh, full of flavor and served within 15-20 minutes of ordering.

We checked out this place on a busy Saturday late afternoon, around 4pm, to meet up with friends in a party of 4. We were lucky and got in without reservations, but by the time that we left (5:30ish) there was over an hour wait! I would strongly encourage you to keep that in mind if you want to pop in for a meal during peak hours. Because of their smaller size, they can be very crowded as well, so if you&#39;re looking for a more intimate formal setting (such as for a first date) this may not be the place for you. This is a great place to meet friends for a few drinks, but conversation can be difficult when the noise really gets going."

We had to wait until someone left at the bar. Instead of this place being called Magos it should be called mas despacio...... 

Almost 20 minutes into this experience and not even offered water, not even a hello - I think the manager here needs to really reconsider another job or really focus on customer service because tonight no ones getting a tip .....

Not good: Impersonal, cold feeling one item per white plate delivery (enchilada, rice, beans, taco). Beer should not be at vegetable cooler temp. Hamburger instead of shredded beef is a sign of a lesser Mex restaurant.

Actually, I know some friends that have been raving about Mago for quite some time now. Somehow I never had the chance to try it out. Well, that is until now.

To start out, we all loved the chips, salsas, and quac. All were delicious. The fresh quac prepared at the table was great. I never knew you put garlic in quac!

So the most highly recommended dish ended up being that best - that was the quesadilla. It was really an excellent combination of spinach and other veggies in a prefect blend of cheese. Secondly, the enchiladas were also quite unique and tasty. They had this flavorful sauce and some kind of breading, which I haven&#39;t had on enchiladas before. Quite good. Last of all, but veggie tacos... they were kind of... meh... Fortunately, the rest of the food made up for it.

Oh and last but not least, we did have the tres leches cake and it was also great. I guess there are very few places that mess that up. :-)

The good:
-wonderful server, very attentive and informed about the menu

-sangria was great and surprisingly strong

-they brought out a sampling of the mole for us to try

-the custom made guac was so good.  We ordered it twice!

The bad:
-food is very salty.  My husband is Mexican, I have learned how to make authentic Mexican (and mole) and it was way overseasoned.  I woke up with puffy eyes from the sodium overload.

-you will be rushed, rushed, rushed.  Sadly, this was not the fault of our server but the overbearing manager who literally hovered around the restaurant and stared down the tables.  
For the large amount of money dropped (several drinks, apps, entrees and desserts), one would expect to be able to enjoy their night without the penetrating stare of the Management.  

-The execution of restaurant space is awful.  There is nowhere for waiting parties to stand, the bar area is very cramped and the door swings right into the hostess stand.

I actually enjoyed the margarita but it wasn&#39;t outstanding or anything.  I did think the service was very good.  The food came out promptly.  Overall, nothing blew me away but it was a solid Mexican food option.

The salsas that come out are good.  There is one avocado and cilantro, which was my least favorite, one habenero, which was my favorite, and one chipotle, which was solid.  I wanted some ceviche so I asked how large it was and the server said small but it was HUGE.  This was the largest ceviche I have ever had.  It was okay but not a traditional ceviche.  The shrimp were whole instead of chopped up and there were olives in it, which didn&#39;t really mesh well with the rest of the flavors.  It was very liquidy as well.  We tried the chicken rolls and I really enjoyed those.  The empanades were solid but they could have been crispier.  We also tried three tacos: the pastor, which was excellent, the steak was okay and the shrimp was just sort of okay.  Overall not bad but nothing stands out either."

We had heard mixed reviews about the place, but decided to give it a try. The chips and 3 salsas are a nice touch initially. Unfortunately, the service is so atrocious that it doesn&#39;t matter if the food is good. We saw several waiters standing around texting in plain view. Absolutely all the staff were curt, unenthusiastic, and visibly rolling their eyes at patrons. I have never seen anything like it! Several tables near us sent back their food and had items taken off their bills. Knowing that it&#39;s gotta be hard dealing with annoyed patrons, we tried to be extra nice to our waitress. The food was pretty good- we had fajitas and the mole tamarindo. Both were tasty and hot. When we asked to have our leftovers wrapped, our waitress came over to the table, took my plate and scraped it over a very tiny container....which spilled the whole contents of the plate all over the table. She visibly didn&#39;t care AT ALL, just swept a few pieces of rice on the ground and shoved the container in a bag. Super awkward!

The pastor was dry and I wasn&#39;t super impressed with the carne asada. I will say I really like the cameron, and that means a lot since shrimp tacos are my favorite kind. I also got a mango passionfruit sangria and it tasted watered down.

I probably will be back, but I want to try some of their other dishes because other people have had better experiences than I have. It&#39;s just unfortunate how pricey they are too! I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because they&#39;re in the Promenade, but their food shouldn&#39;t cost as much as it does."

Our party of  was immediately greeted and seated in the dining area by the bar, the space was kind of weird as it was kind of fenced off on 2 sides, separating the seating area from the windows and the bar. Water and complimentary chips and salsa was brought out to the table as soon as we sat down. Our server was prompt to greet us to ask how we were doing, then if she could get us drinks to start. We literally just sat down. Haven&#39;t even opened the menus yet. We politely requested more time to look at drinks. I would say roughly 10 minutes had passed before our server came back to check on us and see if we wanted something to drink. We were ready to order by this time. Our party of 4 ordered a sangria, a dos equis, a coke, and an ice tea for drinks. For food, we had 2 orders of tacos with extra sour cream, a side of black beans, and 2 orders of arrachera.

Drinks were promptly brought out by someone else. We never did get a 2nd round of drinks, refills on our waters, ice tea, or coke. Even thought we did ask the server. 

I personally felt that the food came out rather slow, but I was told that I might have been hangry. In my previous visits, we would receive complimentary vegetable &amp; tortilla chips soup with the order of arrachera. We didn&#39;t get our soups. I had to ask for it after our food came out. The server thought we didn&#39;t want them. The server also forgot the extra sour cream. That was brought out after we asked another server. And the black beans was brought out after asking for the 3rd time. Also had to look for our server to get our check to pay our bill.

The food itself is absolutely DELICIOUS. If you&#39;ve never tried a mole before, you definitely need to try it. My favorite has been the mole de coco(coconut milk). My friend loved the mole xico(cherry) one. 

Monday, lunch rush. I didn&#39;t expect the service to be this shoddy. We left the restaurant at 2:00 PM. Needless to say, if you have an hour lunch, don&#39;t come here for fast or efficient service."

I came on a Sunday afternoon and the restaurant was full. As I waited for the hostess to take me to my table, two servers passed by, letting me know the hostess would be with me shortly. 
I ordered the green enchiladas. They were good. I wasn&#39;t blown away and my portion was rather small. So as I am reading some of the reviews about how big the portions are, unfortunately, mine wasn&#39;t &#34;huge.&#34; A little pricey for what they serve. The rice under the enchiladas? I had to search for it, because what exactly is a good serving. Only two spoonful of rice. I was disappointed with that.. I think they ran out of rice. 
The restaurant is clean. Beautiful decor. 
If you plan to visit this restaurant, make sure you bring Kleenex :p The food will clear your sinuses, but in a good way. The chips and salsa was delicious.

I was in the mood for good Mexican food this time and wanted to give one more star, since I finally found something I LOVE on the menu.

Okay... I do not like Tequila, however, they do make a Mojito with Rum.  Highly recommend.  The taste is unbelievable, you could definitely get in trouble with these.  I had the Pina Colada flavor which was great.  For dinner, I actually order the appetizers &#34;Rollitos de Pollo&#34; with a side of beans and rice.  WOW, this is very filling, I do not even think I ate half of them (see picture).  I know this may sound weird, but the way they season their beans and rice, I could not stop eating them.

My problem is with the attitude about reserving a table. On more than one occasion I have had a problem booking way in advance. Today (Sunday) we originally had s reservation at 4:30 for 4.

Too much garlic, and not enough salt or lime. BTW, no salt or pepper on tables to season your food. 
I had taco salad, and could not eat it. Server gave me a tiny &#34;to go&#34; cntr and said it was all they had. I had to ask for one more and break the taco shell salad in two, then crush it to fit each cntr. We ordered 2 tres leches cakes to go. They were ok. Bill for 2 for lunch was 69.00 with tip.

First off the atmosphere was amazing- it was very retro and colorful inside the restaurant the and bar was beautiful. 

At the table there were three sauces and tortilla chips and the flavors varied from mild to extremely spicy (but definitely a tasty kick!) We got guacamole (which is made fresh at the table- and you can choose the level of spiciness), we got spicy and I believe they used habaneros in this guacamole. 

For the entree I ordered the 3 tacos and I chose different flavors: 
1. Rajas which was chile poblano rajas, sour cream, roasted sweet corn, crispy potatoes
2. Chorizo which was chorizo, chihuahua cheese, crispy potatoes, chipotle salsa
3. Camaron which was chipotle shrimp, queso fresco, pickled purple cabbage, pico de gallo

If I had to pick a favorite it would have to be the Rajas- it was crunchy and flavorful. At the same time I liked the other two as well, if I were to go back I would still get a combination on tacos not just the Rajas. 

Lastly for desert we got the Tres Leches de la Semana and I guess that the flavor that they put the cake on (this is essentially flavored jelly or syrup the cake sits on) changes weekly. The flavor we had was guava! So fresh and refreshing. If you are not into a flavor you can just ask them to not have the cake sitting on the flavor of the week."

Anyway although the food was actually pretty good and flavorful I felt the price was overrated but I&#39;m sure it has to die with the location and mall fees and expenses etc. usually when I go somewhere for the first time I expect something to stand out but nothing about the food or the building or the ambience did!

It&#39;s one of my favorite local Mexican restaurants. The restaurant itself is brightly decorated with many tables. In warmer weather there&#39;s an outdoor area to dine al fresco. Mago is generally crowded in the evenings, especially the weekends.  I&#39;d recommend making reservations or expect a long wait. A negative is there is no area to wait for your table. The minute you walk into the restaurant you&#39;re at the hostess stand and the bar area is not large so there&#39;s not much standing room there either.  I do enjoy their cocktails...Mago makes a good margarita, especially the mango margarita served in a sugar rimmed glass. Once seated, you are quickly served chips and three salsas with different levels of heat. One of my favorites to order is the guacamole made tableside - it&#39;s fantastic. You can choose the heat level that suits you, too.  I&#39;ve enjoyed many things over my visits, shrimp and carne asada tacos, quesadillas, spinach &amp; mushroom enchiladas and their specialty sea bass dish.

The South Barrington location is about twice the size of Bolingbrook. 

It was about 7:45(we were seated at 6:45) and had finished our dinner. We were given our check and shortly there after we were cashed out. We were still enjoying our after dinner cocktails when in the space of 15 minutes, we were asked 4 times by the manager on duty and once by a server(wasn&#39;t our server) if there was anything else they could get us and how our service was.

We ordered all of his suggested: drinks, app, and entres, and were blown away with it all! We had an amazing meal/experience and would suggest Mago to anybody... and if you don&#39;t mind not sitting at a traditional table, ask for Angelo in the bar"

Chips and salsa were good. We enjoyed the variety of salsas. Had the guacamole that was not made table side but was freshly made. You could tell the ingredients were very fresh!
Everyone had tacos and no one had any complaints. Try the side of corn - spicy good ness! Plantain was also good while sweet potatoes reminded me a bit of French fries they were a hit with my daughter. 
Beverages were yummy - hard to choose between margarita and sangria as both were refreshing ! 
Although the hostess was a bit slow, she was good and the waitress was very helpful. 
Bathroom needed attending - which is why I lowered it down a star - though technically I&#39;d give it 4.5 stars if I could. 
It&#39;s good food with helpful service."

Table side guacamole, tacos, chips w 3 salsa&#39;s, fajitas, mole, etc. I always get the Diablo Margarita. It&#39;s great and will do the job. Only complaint about the place is the service. Both at the table and bar service. Not too attentive...often times need to get attention of servers when wanting to order another drink, get the bill, etc. 3 stars for food and drink quality. Dinged 2 stars for poor service and what I believe to be overly priced with the level of service given."

I definitely can agree that there&#39;s long waits, but good food is worth waiting for! Or just make a reservation/go in off hours. Yesterday (Friday night) I went at 9:30..restaurant was still lively but we were seated in 5 minutes. The chips are always freshly made and all the salsas are great. If you ask nicely they&#39;ll bring you your favorite salsa in a larger bowl. All the food is amazing, my personal favorite is fajitas. It&#39;s much more flavorful and saucy than others I&#39;ve tried. It comes out bubbling hot and covered in melty cheese. The live guac is a little pricey for not actually being table side but still tasty and fresh. Service is great as are the drinks. All in all I definitely recommend magos to anybody looking for quality Mexican food!"

Table-side fresh made to order guacamole for $10 is probably one of the best deals here. Too much for three of us to finish. Top shelf margaritas start at $9 and are not that big. Signature margarita the server suggested was $12! The restaurant is very loud and many of the staff don&#39;t speak English that well and we don&#39;t speak Spanish, so when I asked the lady making the guac to add some garlic, she said she would get me some and walked away. She must have thought I asked for chips. I had a grilled shrimp with a white chocolate mole and some kind of risotto which was excellent, but $30 for 5 shrimp. My husband had the bacon wrapped manchego stuffed shrimp in a tequila cream sauce, also excellent, for $24. Options here for kids are limited. My kid likes their poblano mashed potatoes and she picked at 2 plain steak tacos $7 for 2. I will say they have some prix fixe choices for groups that seem reasonably priced. One thing I don&#39;t like at Mago is that I feel rushed every time I eat there. The entrees come out very fast, which is nice, but you can feel the wait staff pressure to turn over the tables, even on a not-crowded weeknight. Overall, 2 adults, 2 margaritas each, 1 kid, 2 desserts was about $140 plus tip. But we left very satisfied with some leftover tacos and bread pudding."

My daughter and I have enjoyed dining here several times - but never again! We brought her BF - who is black - and were sat in the back room (even though there were tables in the main dining area). I thought this is bit odd, but didn&#39;t make the connection until another groups of diners - a black couple - were the only others who joined us in this room. 
Service was quite slow and the manager (I assume that&#39;s who he was as he wasn&#39;t waiting tables) pointedly came in and stared at us more than once.

In 2014 this is unbelievable behavior and patently unacceptable. We will be taking our dining business elsewhere."

We absolutely love all 3 salsas they serve when you arrive; impossible to pick a favorite.  We also had the guac (spicy) and grilled calamari.  All delicious.  

That being said...  When I went into the washroom, I was greeted by an almost overflowing toilet with an &#34;Out of Order&#34; sign on the back of it.  I get that &#34;shit happens&#34;, but was there really no way to lock the stall door and put the sign outside the stall?  Truly unacceptable."

I love myself a beef burrito. Or steak, or chicken...you get me. But for reals, that veggie burrito...I could eat it every day. In fact, I saved the leftovers for so long I nearly cried when they were gone.

SO GOOD. I could dine alone here every week, just for that burrito. A beautiful assortment of sauteed vegetables, rice and creamy cheese, and a thin line of sour cream on top. Not a deep-fried burrito (chimichanga), so it fools you into thinking you&#39;re eating healthier. Order the red salsa to accompany. So delicious. I didn&#39;t need a side of anything. This was plenty and I only finished a third! It&#39;s a bit spicy, which is ironic, considering there was no warning (and I have a great heat tolerance).

Well alright - now that THAT&#39;s out of the way, I&#39;ll start from the beginning. This is my second go-round to Mago. The first time, there was a 60 minute+ wait on a weekend. No thanks. So the second time around, I was clearly impressed by the food. A generous trio of salsas are served to start. However personally, only two could be considered salsa. The &#34;spiciest&#34; salsa (which I could have literally drank, it wasn&#39;t spicy at all) was more of a cream sauce? Very odd. Chips were yummy, as well.

My first complaint is about the &#34;tableside&#34; guacamole. We were asked how spicy we wanted it, and then the &#34;tableside&#34; guac was made...not tableside. It was instead, made at a cart by a woman that gossiped with other staff. All that aside, at least I could crane my neck to still see it being made. Our &#34;semi-spicy&#34; guac wasn&#39;t spicy one bit. I&#39;m thinking that their &#34;spice&#34; levels are out of whack. Nevertheless, it was a generous portion and very tasty. 

It was a Monday, and I indulged in a $5 margarita on the rocks, which was a special. It was a good size and a good deal and tasted great!

Before our meal we were served a cup of chicken noodle soup, which was a nice surprise. However, I wish I had known we were going to be served it, as I wouldn&#39;t have loaded up as much on chips!

Overall, our food was fantastic, but the service...NOT to match. WOW! As mentioned, our &#34;tableside&#34; guac was not-so-tableside. Our server was very lacking of...anything: personality, words, service, life?

But the weirdest, oddest, most uncomfortable part of the service? We were seated towards the back, where the server station was positioned. A large man stood there nearly the entire night. I never saw him do much but pace around and observe. He literally looked like security. It wasn&#39;t the man that threw me off - but one of the servers who was doing her best to hang all over him every time she got. Walking by and touching him, standing next to him with her hands all over him, and a constant flirty state. He didn&#39;t reciprocate, but I couldn&#39;t believe how this was going on without any manager stopping (or firing!) them. 

Next time I dine, I&#39;ll request a spot away from the back, and eat my veggie burrito in blissful ignorance of the oddly flirtatious couple in the back."

Yesterday made visit #3. I went with my family and they wanted to sit on the patio. Only problem was that it was 93 degrees yesterday and I&#39;m the pale-est person alive and would prefer not to be in the sun unless I&#39;m armed with an SPF 50. Despite my protest, we still ended up sitting on the patio. There was a nice umbrella though so, I was able to sit in the shade. 

I went with a Horchata and 3 tacos and skipped the rice and beans this time around. They got 2 of my tacos right (snapper and shrimp) but I ended up with an additional fish one instead of the chicken one. It wasn&#39;t that big of a deal, since I&#39;ve had the chicken one before, so I just ate them. All 3 were really excellent. I love Mago because it&#39;s all fresh ingredients and they list all of the ingredients on the menu. I&#39;ve been doing the low-carb/gluten-free thing for about a month now and I felt extremely comfortable eating there since they have a huge GF menu. Their food is all really good and I can honestly say I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve had anything bad. Their margaritas are also amaaazing, although I decided to go alcohol-free yesterday. 

Our service this time around was pretty good. We were only 1 of two tables brave enough to sit outside, so we probably didn&#39;t get as much attention as we would have inside, but I don&#39;t fault her for that. 

I can&#39;t recommend Mago enough. Definitely try to make it there and I&#39;d recommend reservations if you&#39;re going for dinner! It can get crowded, but rightfully so."

This would&#39;ve been a 5 star review if it hadn&#39;t been for the horrible service and rude manager I encountered this past Friday*** 
My Daughter and I came here for dinner last Friday 9-18-15 at around 5:00 p.m. We have dined here many times in the past and have always had great service and great food. We always each order one taco because we don&#39;t eat a lot. It all started when the server &#34;Luis O&#34; decided to give us a hard time about putting guacamole on my Daughters taco, because it was only a beef taco. Only the steak comes with guacamole. Ok, fine, although this is a first, I told him we would pay extra. This has never been an issue in the past. Then the food came and there were 3 tacos for each of us (a total of 6) when I explained to him we only ordered 1 taco each, he proceeded to tell me we could only order 3 each! Really? We always only order 1 taco each, and again, never has this been an issue with any other servers. Since Luis clearly wanted to give me a hard time about everything, I asked to speak to the manager. What a joke that was! Neither the manager or Luis wore a name tag, probably because they don&#39;t know how to treat their customers and don&#39;t want anyone knowing their names. I know our server was Luis because his name was on the receipt. I had to ask the girls up front what the managers name was. Given the description I gave them (the heavy set guy with the lazy eye) they told me his name was Eduardo. He couldn&#39;t have been more obnoxious. He sat there with a smirk on his face and laughing at me the whole time. My Daughter even pointed out to me that he was laughing at us. Not very professional Mago! I explained to him I have the lapband and physically cannot eat a lot of food. He wasn&#39;t interested in hearing my side of the story and I told him my company was thinking about having our Christmas party there, but now I&#39;m not so sure after this service I received. He basically told me he didn&#39;t care. Not in those words, I can&#39;t remember his exact words, but he said that&#39;s fine. I can tell anyone anything I want. I finally asked him to leave my table so I could eat. I was appalled at his manager skills. If I didn&#39;t like the food and haven&#39;t had such good service in the past, I would never come back. Next time I will just request a different server if the server is Luis. By the way, Luis only received a $2.00 tip which is so not like me. I always tip very well, but he was the worst server I&#39;ve ever encountered at Mago. I would suggest to Luis and Eduardo that if they don&#39;t know how to treat their customers, maybe they should find a different profession."

We both had the trio of tacos and ordered carne asada which was great, chorizo was Devine, blackened Maho Mahi was spivey and the waitress did warn us which is great cause it does have heat and pastor with grilled pineapple that was a party in your mouth!

It was recommended by another friend when we were talking about mezcal and she said they had a great selection- which they do! 
 
For food I got the pastor tacos, which I decided on solely because it had grilled pineapple. I was severely disappointed when it came out with one teeny tiny piece on top... I was really looking forward to that. The pork itself was kind of dry, I added the salsa they give you which helped, but the flavor itself was good. My friend got the vegetarian enchiladas. Not bad but nothing to rave about either. 

I was going to give three stars based on the food, but the bartender really was awesome! I wish I could remember his name. We wanted to try some of the mezcal after eating. My first drink was the one on their menu with mezcal and cucumbers- amazing! My friend got the mojito which was great as well. The bartender took the time to go through some of the mezcal they carry, and we ended up trying the $8 one which was good! They have one that was a reposado at $18 per pour and he gave us each a little bit to try- fantastic!! 

Overall it will probably be a while before I go back specifically for the food, but I will definitely be back for the drinks!"

We should have stopped there. We both got the same dish Salmon with coconut mole. His was very salty and mine tasted very fishy. We both only ate a few bites of the fish. The &#34;cilantro&#34; rice was over cooked and didnt have cilantro in it...was also served with two very small asparagus stalks. Both of our plates were pretty untouched as the busser grabbed the plates not bothering to  offered boxes Togo into the trash the food went; not like we would have taken it home with us.

Three margaritas, calamari appetizer, shrimp enchiladas and fish tacos came to $81.  Based on the price, this is not the neighborhood Mexican place we were looking for and probably won&#39;t be going back anytime soon.
The restaurant is VERY loud and the wait staff slams your food down on the table.  Speaking of tables-they&#39;re way too small.  We had a bottle of water, water glasses, silverware, margaritas glasses, bread plates, chips and salsa on the table and there was no room when the appetizers and entrees came.
They advertise different kinds of tequila and we would go back if they had a tequila tasting and tapas event.  That would be cool."

Why haven&#39;t we tried this before now?  Doesn&#39;t matter, we would definitely get Olive Theory again!"

Love the idea behind this local pizza place---make your meal your own with all the yummy fresh ingredients while helping out the community---every little bit counts.  The fam and I like the crispy thin crust and being able to heap on whatever toppings we desire.  

The first time I went in with a large group of kids they were having some trouble with their payment system because of our large order--hope they are able to get it fixed----we usually roll deep when we roll out to eat anywhere LOL---lucky I had some cash on me---which 98% of the time usually does not happen...

Place is clean, ample parking, and quick service.  Definitely will be back!"

The workers were very welcoming and friendly. I got the 7.99 pizza sandwich with any toppings and it was mouth watering. Great pizza sandwich, the outer crust was perfect with a few bread crumbs to add some

Super clean and very modern. I love that they have a gluten free option.  What caught my attention was that the staff asked me if my gluten free was a preference or a food allergy.  Why? Well if you have a gluten allergy, they prepare it away from everything that can possibly contaminate your food.  How awesome is that! 

The pizza is about 10-12 inch which is perfect for a very hungry person.  I got my gluten free for an additional 2 bucks and it takes a few more minutes to cook. But the crust was so good. It was perfectly crispy for a gluten free crust.  Ordered a side salad on top of that.  Good meal and good service."

You choose exactly how you want your crust, sauce, cheese, meat and veggies.   I saw one person say it was flavorless.  I know to each his own, but truly.  With all due respect?  Not sure how that is even possible.  Add Poseidon&#39;s Blessing - grated parm, sea salt and oregano, or one of the other seasonings they offer.  I am guessing that perhaps the sauce starts a little bland to accommodate all pallets, then you amp up the spice as you choose?  Not sure because I have always asked for extra seasoning (but I do that with every pizza I order, regardless where it comes from - I like spice!!)  If you forget, they have red pepper and oregano on the tables, too.....

Everything is SO fresh and flavorful.   And the pizzas are very generous in size.  I will say one thing.  The first time we went the crust was super crispy on the edges, and a little soggy in the middle.  Today we asked them to leave the pizzas in for another 30 seconds.  It was PERFECT. 

Honestly, it&#39;s great pizza, and a phenomenal value. We take home leftovers every time."

I had a friend from out of state visiting and she wanted to try something new. We both were greeted and given the low down on how this place works. For $8 you get a 11 inch thin crust pizza with any topping you would like. They bake them in a little brick oven in front of you. They also make sandwiches and salads. It truly is like a chipotle but with pizza. 
      As for flavor, the ingredients made the pizza fresh. A member of our party had just a plain cheese pizza and it tasted remarkably similar to mall pizza (sabarros). I&#39;m surprised they didn&#39;t have an option for a kids sized pizza. I&#39;m aware that a lot of their competitors in the &#34;customizable pizza&#34; industry (pie five) offer kid menus. 
    The restaurant itself is in a good location. It looks clean and modern. No complaints!"
olive-theory-pizzeria-downers-grove,Peter T.,VP5wjC-QIeKvUv6_E-laBA,"Chicago, IL",1,1,0,91,24,iq_G1_ImR1Nabfgeh7r9rA,5.0,2016-06-08,"I have a so much  admiration for  people who start a restaurant with just a concept in mind and build a business from the ground up. It&#39;s a really tough, competitive segment - the best statistics available  recently show 60% of new restaurants fail within the first three years.  Any start-up is tough, I know, because I&#39;ve been involved in dozens.

I  have ten times the admiration for people who start a restaurant as an independent operation in a segment that is rapidly growing and has some tough competitors already in place.

Undaunted by that notion, the brothers Kwok created &#34;Olive Theory Pizzeria&#34; in the Chicago western suburb of Downers Grove. They had done their research, dined at a number of the established concept outlets and contemplated and investigated acquiring one of the franchise operations instead of going it alone.

In the end, they believed the restrictions of the franchisors would inhibit the Kwoks creating their vision of the restaurant - one where they could offer the highest quality ingredients, as well as menu items that wouldn&#39;t be permitted under any of the franchise operating guidelines.

All that is fortunate for Chicago area diners in search of high quality &#34;made on demand&#34; wood fired pizza.

They call it &#34;Olive Theory&#34; as a reference to a tale from Greek mythology, wherein the olive tree, a most bountiful gift, was created in a contest to please the King. It&#39;s the Kwok&#39;s goal to offer bounty to the community, while maintaining an operation based on sustainability.

It&#39;s quick and easy to order - grab a menu card (pictured below) at the counter and describe the pie you want or order one of the house specials. For a (low) flat price, you can have as many toppings as you like atop a cracker thin crust, cooked to order in minutes. One thing that differentiates Olive Theory from similar operations is the restaurants commitment to &#34;fresh- prepared in store,&#34; and the highest quality ingredients they can source locally. Outlets of chain operations aren&#39;t allowed the flexibility to chase either of those ideals.

The dough for the crust is made in-house daily, allowed to rest and raise as proper dough requires. The classic tomato sauce is made from what many chefs consider the finest tomatoes in the world, San Marzanos from a particular region of Italy. If you&#39;re in the mood for something other than red sauce, you have six other choices to contemplate. There are five cheeses available, a host of meat and vegetable toppings, as well as &#34;finishing touches&#34; like garlic or truffle oil.

Looking for something a little different, try Olive Theory&#39;s version of a calzone, the &#34;Pie-Sandwich,&#34; your choice of pizza ingredients in a folded over version of their dough, and baked til golden brown. Salads and a daily soup are also on the menu.

We had a diverse selection at the table, including the house special pies of &#34;Buddha&#39;s Karma,&#34; &#34;Titan&#39;s Unleashed,&#34; and &#34;Goldbergs Big Five;&#34; each of these pies have a special combination of ingredients that are nearly musical in the way they come together. Truly. I&#39;m a fan of Italian sausage and pepperoni in nearly any form, but Olive Theory&#39;s are spectacular to me.

In addition to being a great place to grab a quick lunch or dinner, dining there or taking it home, it occurred to me that it&#39;s a wonderful destination for families - the pricing is such that it provides a wonderful family outing at a really great value, and the kids will love the &#34;build your own&#34; concept, knowing they aren&#39;t going to have to eat around whatever ingredients dad usually insists on.

Families concerned about the quality of what they eat and where it comes from can also take comfort in the offerings.  I feel the ambiance / atmosphere is also conducive to families and groups, with large tables, good lighting,  and soft background music.

Olive Theory has a selection of beer, soft drinks, and iced tea to go with your meal, as well as some really great dessert offerings, including fresh baked cookies, hot from the oven.

I asked when and where location # 2 will show up, and they just smiled. They did say &#34;no&#34; to locating it my garage, even tho I thought that would be an outstanding site. 

They  are open from 11AM -10PM every day. If you&#39;re nearby and want to pick up, you can even order online or call 630-519-5152.  Catering services available too!"

Olive Theory Pizza sent emails to our school staff yesterday advertising a free pizza, salad, or sandwich (with the purchase of a fountain drink) for Teacher Appreciation Day.

That. is. SO. awesome!

Even though Olive Theory is a few miles from school, I had admittedly never heard of them. I&#39;m so glad their email brought me in, though!

An employee at the counter sweetly explained how it all worked. Aside from the options above, they have soup and breadsticks. I was reeeeally stuffed from my late lunch, so just opted for a single carry-out pizza with no add-ons.

You can Create Your Own and apparently they let you have unlimited veggies - yay! I went with their &#34;Buddha&#39;s Karma.&#34; It includes fire roasted olive oil, mozarella cheese, spinach, mushrooms, and parmesean.

Verdict? 5/5
My pizza was DELICIOUS! I&#39;m usually big on sauce, but the olive oil was delicious in its place! The thin crust was crisp with a little bit of chew, the cheeses melded so well together, and the fresh toppings were great! I could have used some more greens and mushrooms, but know that going overboard can result in a soggy pie.

Next time, though, because there WILL be a &#34;next time&#34;!

I love that they have ginger ale in their fountain machine. AND they carry beer - including Revolution.

They have a nice, big, clean dining space. Ingredients were clearly fresh and employees were friendly. Oh, and their philanthropy?  Also great. (Who doesn&#39;t love Givers?!)

I&#39;ll undoubtedly be making MANY return trips to Olive Theory. Thank you guys for the email inviting teachers and staff in, as well as the generous meal: it was VERY much appreciated!"

Basically, it is like Build-A-Bear, but with pizzas. I was really excited to check  this place out, however, my friends kept telling me that the quality of the pizzas at this restaurant are similar to uBuild Pizza Workshop (which was not a good thing). This place is right next to Panera, just in case for those who are terrible with direction like myself. My friends and I ended up ordering two pizzas to go. We were really disappointed with one of the pizzas. The pizza that my friends got was pretty decent, however, the other pizza was somewhat undercooked. We noticed that the mushrooms on the pizza was straight up raw. 

I would definitely come back to this place again and hopefully update my review after my next visit. Do not get me wrong, the pizzas, or should I say one of the pizzas was decent. It was just one of those bad day. The pizza that my friends got seem pretty healthy and it was only 8 bucks. Even though it claims to be a one person pizza, I am pretty sure that one of their pizzas is big enough for two people to share."

It&#39;s as if the pizza sauce came STRAIGHT out of the can. A good sauce should have seasonings like garlic,salt,oregano,and Basil- some combination of seasonings. I can&#39;t get over that horrible sauce.

I ordered a pepperoni and bacon pizza with garlic oil on top. How on earth was it flavorless? I dissected it,I tasted everything separately. The pepperoni is not good,how did they find a salt free pork product? I chewed the hell out of that pepperoni searching for the salty satisfaction that I was craving. The bacon was good.

The cheese tasted fresh. The pizza crust is a mystery. The rim was well toasted and crispy good,the whole inside was soggy and super chewy-weird. Guess I&#39;ll eat outer pizza crust and bacon for dinner.

My boyfriend liked his pizza,he ordered 3 meats,2 cheeses,veggies,and hot peppers. I tasted his pizza and the flavor came from the ham and the hot peppers.

I think this place would be fun for kids,and I might return with some Italian seasonings to add to my pizza before eating it...go for the experience,but don&#39;t choose the low fat,no salt pepperoni."

For a child who will only eat maybe 2 pieces, 4 pieces were eaten.   They only eat cheese and we had mozzarella and cheddar.  

I also had the BBQ chicken.  I thought it had a nice taste and would go back again.  The crust was slightly chewy, but the flavors on top worth it.  Also, we did take out, so I would like to try it again but dining in.   I like the uniqueness of adding pineapple to the BBQ pizza, as well as the fact that the chicken was seasoned (unlike other restaurants).  

The Caesar salad was okay... too many red onions and there was no option for spring mix.  

Overall, a nice experience. I would give it 4 stars, but asked the 3 year old to rate and they gave this place 5.   They would go back again, and stated &#34;I loved that restaurant&#34;... So, there, from the mouths of babes.."

So after doing a quick Yelp search of the area, my sister and I ended up at this place. I was aware that it was still fairly new to the area, so that was exciting.

Very clean, quaint, modern looking dining area.. reminded me of Chipotle appearance wise, but smaller. I went around 6:45p on a Wednesday evening and it was pretty quiet inside. There were small families dining here and there, but the ambience wasn&#39;t super loud at all, even the music played quietly. The process seemed a bit self explanatory, but it helped that the gentleman behind the counter (seemed like the manager) talked us through a bit of the ordering process.

There was a small line behind me, so because I was new to the place I hurried and ordered something familiar as to not keep everyone behind me waiting. Classic red sauce, mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, sausage, bacon and spinach. I also ordered a side Caesar salad.

The prices were great! $7.99 for a thin crust 11in pizza with unlimited toppings(that I couldn&#39;t finish), and $2.99 for a fresh side salad? Not bad at all.

The only thing is, I wish the guy behind the counter would&#39;ve suggested flavors and toppings to us since we&#39;d never been there before. Or maybe have a small suggestion card that new customers can look over to try some of the different flavors/toppings without it being too much of a guessing game.

The food is first ordered and paid for at the counter, and then you take a number, take a seat and make sure the number is visible. One of the employees will deliver your food to you as its finished being prepared/cooked. Now onto the food..

My side Caesar salad was yummy!! I&#39;m a huge fan of Caesar dressing, so when it&#39;s good.. it&#39;s good, even had a sweet kick to it. The salad was freshly washed and prepared, toppings were onions, tomatoes and buttered croutons. Very good to know that it wasn&#39;t thrown in a bowl from a bag. 

The pizza looked GREAT when they brought it to my table. But as soon as I picked up a slice, I knew I should&#39;ve asked them to cook it a little longer for me. The toppings tasted great and VERY fresh, but the crust was a bit too chewy for my taste. Granted, I see that they make their own dough, and that&#39;s super impressive.. but I like my pizza dough a bit more crunchy once it&#39;s cooked. That and the fact that the red classic sauce is just bland tomato sauce were the reasons I knocked off a star. Flavor is important to me.

Maybe next time I go, because there will be a next time.. I&#39;ll be a little more of a pro at ordering and I&#39;ll be able to put together a really flavorful, well done pizza. This place has a very cool concept and the employees are extremely nice and catering, so I hope they stay around for the long haul."

They just opened up recently so they are still figuring stuff out.   They brought the pizza out to the table.   
The pizza is a thin crust and tasty.  The sandwich is a tad small for the same price.  Maybe it&#39;s in my head.

It&#39;s simple things that show people care that keep my faith in &#34;making America great again&#34;... wait, what?

My family ordered a Buddha&#39;s Karma, Mediterranean Salad, and I got a stacked pizza with everything I&#39;ve ever wanted on a pizza (but never ordered because, hey, toppings are expensive). I think I probably got over 5-6 toppings on my pizza. For about $8, you get unlimited fresh toppings and customization of your pizza--the &#34;Chipotle of pizza&#34;. Before I even took a bite, I had realized this was (a) owned by really sweet people, (b) a really great deal, and (c) very efficient(!) staff. We were fed within 10 minutes. 

The pizza is friggin&#39; rad. If I wasn&#39;t impressed before, I was when I devoured this pizza. It&#39;s about 12&#34;, the size of an LP, and with really crispy thin crust. The ingredients were stacked and flavorful. The salad complemented our pizzas, too. And to finish it off, I had a Nutella/Banana pizza with some peanut butter on the side. It was only $3 and sufficiently tied up the meal. Total, it was about $30 for 2 pizzas, a salad, a drink, and dessert--and knowledge that the money is going towards charity and kind owners!

One of the main difference is that olive theory pizzeria used a brick stone oven whereas pie five uses a machine to bake the pizza.

I got the BBQ chicken pizza that I made myself because you have the option to choose as many toppings as you want!

The pizza was well made and delicious. The only option that pie five provides whereas olive theory pizzeria does not is that pie five gives different crust options. Otherwise, I would come here again for pizza!"

I ordered the off menu bbq chicken pizza. I&#39;m a bbq chicken pizza enthusiast... and I think I&#39;m willing to say this was the best. 

The staff was super helpful and seemed happy to be at work. As a former pizzeria employee, I enjoy seeing that. They take pride in their work even as young people. You know it&#39;s good when teenagers are on their best behavior :) 

My husband always wants to get crazy amounts of toppings on pizza, so the price point is an extra win!"

It&#39;s a quick fire pizza with as many toppings you want for one price (7. 99- I got Mozzarella, parm, pineapple, mushrooms, ham, bacon, chicken with the sea salt blend) and it only took 3 minutes to cook.

A great concept --you can build your own pizza and they make it in front of you, similar to a chipotle or subway. Then they put it in the oven and bring it to your table. Very thin crispy crus which I love. The red sauce was excellent and I had mozzarella, Parmesan, bacon, spinach and mushrooms. They had plenty of great meat, cheese,and veggie options to chose from and unlimited. 

My pizza was cooked perfectly and my pizza and drink was like $10. Such a fantastic lunch place or a casual dinner.

Inside was clean and modern. Staff was very friendly.

This will be my pizza go-to now instead of Labriola which has become overpriced with long waits."

They&#39;re much better then uBuild Pizza Workshop down the street and have better ingredients to put on your pizza. The garlic pesto is my personal favorite and there&#39;s three different types of olives you can choose from. The cheesy bread is also great if you have a big enough appetite. Each pizza is so big it&#39;s enough for two people or they have boxes for leftovers.

The restaurant was clean and bright, though the front area was a little too bright.  The staff greeted us when we entered.  Ordering was self explanatory.  We each ordered one of the house special pizzas, along with a caesar salad.  The price of $7.99 for each pizza was a deal! 

The food all came out in less than 10 minutes.  The pizzas were hot and the salad cold.   

We loved their pizzas.  On all, the crisp was super thin and really crispy.  My son had the Darwin&#39;s Natural Selection, lots of meat.  My wife had the Buddha&#39;s Karma.  I had the Titan&#39;s Unleashed.  Our only complaint was that the Buddha needed some more flavor- garlic or something.  

The staff checked on us a couple of times, gave my wife a sample of their homemade mushroom soup, and even brought us warm chocolate chip cookies!

She told me about this place she described as &#34;delicious.&#34; She couldn&#39;t have been more right with that description!!

This place was so good and the prices can not be bet! You can either get a pizza, sandwich, or salad and add any and all toppings you want!

I personally got a pizza with garlic pesto and sriracha sauce, three different cheeses, spinach, and chicken. My boyfriend got a pizza with marinara and sriracha sauce, tomatoes, onions, two different cheeses, sausage, and pepperoni and we both LOVED them! 

On top of the food being amazing the whole set up in there was so nice and very quaint. You walk up and order and then they will deliver your food to your table. It&#39;s like a Culvers set up where you put your number on the table and the server brings it out. 

One last thing, the day we went there they had a special for free pizza from 4pm-8pm. Me and my boyfriend walked in there at 7 and the line was almost out the door so we left. We came back about 8:15 and ordered (thinking we were going to pay full price). To our surprise the manager or owner did not charge us for either of our pizzas. He also checked on us at our table about two times to make sure everything was good. He is a great asset to their team.

Needless to say, this place is amazing and I promise you will not regret trying it out :)"

I&#39;ve been getting to try many of them. Some have highlights.. Olive theory didn&#39;t. The crust was the typical thin and crispy type.. Sauce was mediocre and one positive is they have Sriracha.. Other than that mostly run of the mill ingredients. It would be nice to see out of the box toppings like corn and black bean for those wanting to build something Southwestish.. I found they use lots of cheese which some like. Don&#39;t bother paying for the pizza dippers it&#39;s pizza crust with oil and seasoning and marinara in a little bowl. The restaurant is nice and clean.. I have a few choices for this type of pizza in the area now and that.. Is a good thing.

The Italian sausage was just like what I&#39;d cook up at home, not the uniform pellet-looking pieces of sausage. The bacon was REAL! Props to Olive Theory for not giving me bacon bits! I chose the basic red pizza sauce which was good - not too sweet, not too spicy. (The pesto sauce looked good and that will be for my next visit.) I thought the crust was outstanding - not too bread-y and not like a thin cracker...a perfectly delicious combo of the two. The prep line was a bit slow, but the employees were precise and I wasn&#39;t in a hurry. We did order a dessert pizza for $2.99 and it was pretty small. The size wasn&#39;t as issue as much as the scant toppings. I ordered the Nutella banana dessert pizza and got exactly four little slices of banana - one for each piece of he dessert, which was cut into fourths. I would have preferred a few slices of banana for each dessert slice and a dollop of whip cream on all four sections vs the one dollop in the middle. Overall, I felt I got the most value for my money at this &#34;fast food&#34; pizza place and the fresh cut/cooked ingredients made Olive Theory a standout in my experience."

FREE. No strings attached. The people were so friendly &amp; really cared about making conversation &amp; giving it a fun atmosphere. The pizza was sooo good in my opinion. I love the fire oven authentic pizza style. They have so many options for toppings everybody is sure to find something they like. Also they have dessert pizzas!

The employees are so friendly, knowledgable, and helpful. The atmosphere is laid back, and the space is very clean. 10 out of 10 would recommend to a friend."

The staff also rocks!  I try to stop by when I&#39;m in the Yorktown area.  They also give back to the local community with every purchase.
